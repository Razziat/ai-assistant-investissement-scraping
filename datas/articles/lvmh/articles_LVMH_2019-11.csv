Luxury Giant LVMH to Buy Tiffany for $16.2 Billion (Published 2019) - The New York Times,"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTkvMTEvMjUvYnVzaW5lc3MvbHZtaC10aWZmYW55LWRlYWwuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world’s largest luxury goods company, said on Monday that it had reached an agreement to buy the jeweler Tiffany & Company in a $16.2 billion deal, the largest ever in the luxury sector.

The acquisition will give LVMH a bigger foothold in the United States, as well as help Tiffany in Europe and China. It will also cement the status of Bernard Arnault, the LVMH chairman and chief executive, as the most acquisitive deal maker in the luxury business.

“Tiffany is an American icon and was on the list of brands for a long time we thought was a good potential match,” Mr. Arnault said in a telephone interview from Paris.

The acquisition would add another prominent American name to the LVMH stable of brands, which includes Dior, Givenchy, Fendi and Dom Pérignon. The deal would help propel the French luxury company into a leadership position not only in traditional soft luxury goods like clothing and handbags, but also in what is known as the hard luxury sector, which includes watches and jewelry."
LVMH scoops up Tiffany for $16.2 billion - CNN,"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAxOS8xMS8yNS9pbnZlc3RpbmcvdGlmZmFueS1sdm1oLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9uL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAUVodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDE5LzExLzI1L2ludmVzdGluZy90aWZmYW55LWx2bWgtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hong Kong CNN Business —

LVMH (LVMHF) and Tiffany & Co. (TIF) are finally getting together after weeks of anticipation.

The two companies announced Monday that LVMH will buy the Manhattan jeweler, famous for its little blue boxes and Fifth Avenue flagship store. The French luxury group will pay $135 per share, valuing Tiffany at about $16.2 billion.

A deal had been expected for weeks. Tiffany and LVMH both confirmed in October that they were in talks to combine after Paris-based LVMH reached out with an unsolicited initial offer of $14.5 billion. That was already a premium over Tiffany’s stock price at the time.

The deal is one of the largest in the history of the luxury sector and in the career of LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault, Europe’s richest man.

LVMH is the world’s biggest luxury group and home to 75 different brands, including Christian Dior and Bulgari. Analysts have been bullish on its latest deal, saying that Tiffany is a good acquisition target because of its strong global brand.

“A takeover of Tiffany could make a lot of sense,” analysts at Bernstein wrote in a research note last month. While Tiffany is one of the world’s best-known luxury brands, analysts say it still has room to grow, particularly in jewelry and watches. And LVMH’s deep pockets could help Tiffany turn around after a rocky few years, and fuel its effort to better connect with millennial consumers.

In a statement Monday, Tiffany chairman Roger N. Farah said the deal would give the company “an exciting path forward with a group that appreciates and will invest in Tiffany’s unique assets and strong human capital.”

The deal would also bolster LVMH’s jewelry and watch lineup, which already includes legacy brands such as Hublot and TAG Heuer. It would also boost the French company’s presence in the United States, which accounts for about a quarter of its revenue.

LVMH has for years been the top seller of high-end goods, according to a Deloitte analysis published this year. But sales in its jewelery and watch division make up only 9% of the company’s total revenue.

Tiffany, a 182-year-old jeweler, employs 14,000 people and operates 300 stores around the globe. In recent years, however, its sales have slumped.

LVMH, meanwhile, has enjoyed much more success among millennials, attracting attention from prominent influencers including Kylie Jenner and Cardi B. It owns major fashion houses such as Fendi and Louis Vuitton, as well as beverage brands Moet and Hennessy. Earlier this year, the conglomerate acquired Rihanna’s Fenty and Fenty Beauty fashion and cosmetics lines, which have enjoyed unique success marketing to a diverse swath of young women.

Tiffany and LVMH said Monday that the deal is expected to close in the middle of 2020."

In doing so, the luxury group is forging into enemy territory: also known as the Right Bank, where department store rival Groupe Galeries Lafayette has long dominated the multi-brand retail landscape and recently opened a second location on the Champs-Elysées. (Renowned department store Le Bon Marché, which LVMH Chairman and Chief Executive Bernard Arnault purchased in 1984, is a Left Bank mainstay.)

DFS, the Hong Kong-headquartered travel retailer (also owned by LVMH), will operate the 20,000 square-metre space, renamed La Samaritaine Paris Pont-Neuf. There will be more than 600 brands on offer, including big names notably Louis Vuitton, as well as independent labels like Los Angeles-based dress line Brock Collection and jeweller Pascale Monvoisin.

The “selective offer” places La Samaritaine at the intersection of “[Avenue] Montaigne and Le Marais” in terms of taste, according to Eléonore de Boysson, DFS president for Europe and the Middle East. While some brands will operate under the concession model — meaning that they will operate their spaces themselves — most will have wholesale agreements.

The beauty department (which will cover more than 3,000 square metres) will be the largest in a post-Brexit Europe, according to de Boysson. Certain labels, including Charlotte Tilbury, will only be available in Paris at the store. Unlike Le Bon Marché, located in Paris' 7th arrondissement, there won't be any homeware, kidswear or groceries, so beauty will be an important driver of both foot traffic and sales.

La Samaritaine, with its carefully restored Art Nouveau interiors and striking — if controversial — glass facade designed by Japanese agency Sanaa, should be popular with tourists and curious Parisians alike. But both LVMH and Galeries Lafayette are scaling in the midst of a tough time for multi-brand retailers, which are struggling to both retain in-store customers and maintain online growth. The recent bankruptcy and subsequent liquidation of luxury retailer Barneys New York, continued challenges at the Neiman Marcus Group and struggles at online retailers including Farfetch, Yoox Net-a-Porter Group and MatchesFashion indicate an outdated, increasingly commoditised model.

The landscape in France is also different than it was when LVMH acquired a majority stake in La Samaritaine nearly 20 years ago. Sluggish demand has seen sales of clothing and textiles in the country fall 1.3 percent in the first nine months of 2019, according to the Institut Français de la Mode. The department store channel in the period was down 0.7 percent.

Paris' department stores have also taken a hit this year, in part because of the ongoing ""gilet jaunes"" demonstrations, where populist workers seeking economic justice march on the streets, often in crowded, commerce-heavy neighborhoods. The much-anticipated opening of Galeries Lafayette Champs-Elysees has seen results ""below expectations,"" company Chief Executive Nicolas Houzé told BoF in October, and the Paris flagship of Qatari-owned retailer Le Printemps has also been impacted.

LVMH, however, has had great success with building department stores in the past. Le Bon Marché, which was founded in 1838, has been part of the group since its establishment in 1987, three years after Arnault acquired it. LVMH does not break out sales at its brands, but Le Bon Marché's annual sales were estimated to be €550 million in 2017, a double-digit increase from the year previous, according to a Reuters report. However, Le Bon Marché is only one location. Its grocery store, La Grande Épicerie, has expanded further. In 2017, LVMH launched multi-brand retailer 24S, which replaced Le Bon Marché's old e-commerce offering.

In order to best serve international tourists — a big draw at any retailer located in the centre of Paris — LVMH looked to DFS, which has “in-depth knowledge” and understanding of the Asian consumer. (The company operates stores in 16 airports and 18 cities, mainly in Asia.) International clientele is expected to represent around half of the foot traffic and the majority of the sales, according to De Boysson, so services will include “seamless detax” at the point of sale, an international loyalty programme and parking spaces for buses around the nearby Louvre museum. “The first arrondissement [where La Samaritaine is located] is the least populated borough of Paris,” said La Samaritaine Chairman and Chief Executive Jean-Jacques Guiony who is also LVMH Chief Financial Officer. “We have the ambition to go get the tourism clientele.”

LVMH expects the store to draw “several millions of visitors” in its first year. (DFS’s first European store in Venice, Italy, attracted 3 million visitors in its first 12 months.) De Boysson, for one, is confident that La Samaritaine will be strong enough to formidably compete in an increasingly crowded, increasingly challenging market. “Paris is still the first global tourist destination and it continues to grow,"" she said, adding that it’s important to go beyond apparel retail. With that, the store will offer 12 different food vendors.

Tiffany is latest jewel for French luxury group LVMH's crown - The Associated Press,"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3BhcmlzLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtbmV3cy1saWZlc3R5bGUtbmV3LXlvcmstYXAtdG9wLW5ld3MtNDI2MjVkMmM0YjZkNGI1M2E3MTIwYzU4Njg5YzNiOGLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS (AP) — French luxury group LVMH has agreed to buy New York jeweler Tiffany & Co. for $16.2 billion, adding a famed star to its portfolio that already boasts Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Bulgari.

LVMH said in a statement Monday it will take over the 182-year old Tiffany and its 300 boutiques worldwide at $135 a share. The price tag is higher than the $14.5 billion cash offer LVMH made last month.

Tiffany, known for its delicate jewelry, distinctive blue boxes and an Audrey Hepburn movie, says the deal will ensure its long-term sustainability. The company is trying to transform its brand to appeal to younger and more digital shoppers, and could use an owner with deep pockets to help expand its business.

Tiffany’s stock closed Monday up more than 6% in New York, while LVMH rose 2% in Paris.

LVMH, led by billionaire Bernard Arnault, says the deal will strengthen its position in high-end jewelry and in the U.S. market. The purchase will help the French conglomerate compete with Gucci-owner Kering Group and Cartier-owner Richemont SA. With its purchase of Tiffany, LVMH is also making a big bet on China’s economy— Tiffany has been expanding its presence in China with plans to build more stores there.

LVMH already owns 75 brands including Christian Dior, Fendi, and Givenchy as well as watchmaker Tag Heuer. Its flagship brand Louis Vuitton recently opened a handbag workshop in Texas, with President Donald Trump in attendance.

LVMH said both companies’ boards approved the deal and hope to finalize the takeover in 2020, subject to the approval of regulators and Tiffany shareholders.

LVMH “knows how to preserve the strength and the identity of its brands, which is very important because in the luxury sector, beyond the product itself, the image is important,” said Aude Latouche, a Paris-based corporate mergers and acquisitions analyst at AL Corporate Advice. “So to be where they are now, LVMH definitely knows not only how to buy a brand, but also how to make it grow and flourish without touching the heart and the strength of the brand.”

Tiffany is less of a household name in Europe than it is in the U.S. but enjoys a high-visibility boutique on the Champs-Elysees Avenue — just down the street from Louis Vuitton’s flagship store.

In Paris, Arnault is seen as the unelected president of the luxury world. One of Europe’s richest men, he’s ever-present at VIP events — and especially during the city’s Fashion Weeks, where LVMH brands hold a prominent place, and he and his children Delphine and Antoine are often parked in the front row. The Tiffany purchase is seen as confirming his status as the man to beat in the industry, and further distanced LVMH from its rivals.

The offer comes as luxury goods companies have been wrestling with changing habits of shoppers who are increasingly buying online. They’re also purchasing secondhand luxury items from places like The RealReal.com.

In addition, luxury companies are facing fears of an economic slowdown in China, a key area of business, while they’re already dealing with a slowdown in international tourism in the U.S.

Overall, the global market for personal luxury goods is healthy, reaching a record high of $286.53 (260 billion euros) in 2018 — a 6% increase from the year before, according to consulting firm Bain & Co. Jewelry in particular has been one of the top luxury growth categories, enjoying 7% sales increase to a little over $20 billion last year. Luxury sales in the Americas reached $88 billion (80 billion euro) last year, a growth rate of 5%, according to Bain & Co.

The U.S. luxury market has been helped by a strong economy and overall luxury spending by local consumers. However, a strong dollar has curbed spending by tourists from Asia and other countries.

Overall U.S. luxury sales, excluding jewelry, have fallen 2.7% so far this year compared to a 3.1% increase in overall retail sales, according to MasterCard SpendingPulse, which tracks sales across all types of payments including cash and checks. Jewelry sales, however, have risen 2.6% so far this year.

Under its CEO, Alessandro Bogliolo, Tiffany is trying to appeal to younger shoppers with more modern takes on jewelry. Earlier this year, it launched a men’s jewelry collection, and it’s increasing its marketing to a more diverse customer base like same-sex couples. It’s also been renovating its flagship store in Manhattan.

Tiffany has been putting plans in place to appeal to a younger group of customers who are more used to shopping online and hunting for fashion deals. Tiffany has notably highlighted ways customers can personalize jewelry and started letting people trace the origin of their diamonds.

Still, Tiffany’s U.S. sales have been stagnating as China’s slowing economy has weighed on spending by Chinese tourists, who make up a substantial portion of luxury spending. The strong dollar has also made Tiffany products more expensive for consumers outside the U.S.

China’s sales in mainland China continue to be strong, according to Tiffany. To maintain its momentum, Tiffany is either opening or upgrading its flagship stores in three key metropolitan areas: Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. It’s also expanding its airport duty-free store networks. During the current quarter, it plans to open its first Tiffany store in a duty-free zone in mainland China at the Beijing Airport with a partner. This past fall, it relocated and upgraded its directly owned store at the Hong Kong airport.

It’s also going after the Chinese online shopper. Tiffany launched a China e-commerce site in August, its 14th e-commerce enabled website globally.

Tiffany had sales of $4.4 billion in 2018, an increase of nearly 7% over 2017. LVMH reported 6.3 billion euros in profits in 2018 on 46.8 billion euros in sales.

For LVMH, the deal will give the world's largest luxury goods company a bigger name in fine jewelry and make it a bigger player in the U.S. For Tiffany, which has been criticized for lacking innovation, the deal could enable it to freshen its products and will help it grow overseas. The deal also comes as demand for diamonds globally is going through a resurgence.

LVMH executives agree with the broad strategies that Tiffany's management team has laid out to improve growth. But they also say the retailer's turnaround would have taken far more money and time than Tiffany's shareholders might have been willing to accept.

""We expect to bring Tiffany time and capital, which are two things that are not too easy to get when you report quarterly to the stock market,"" LVMH finance chief Jean-Jacques Guiony told analysts during a call Monday morning, after the deal was announced.

LVMH's plans for Tiffany have three main parts: Increasing the brand's value, improving its retail network and expanding its product offerings. LVMH hasn't yet said how many of Tiffany's 300 stores it may close. But LVMH is famous for finding the top retail locations in major markets, and for shuttering stores that don't perform.

Tiffany has come under pressure as French luxury brand Cartier has been investing more in targeting younger shoppers. Cartier parent company Richemont's jewelry business, which is headquartered in Switzerland, has an operating margin of about twice that of Tiffany.

Based on how he has handled a slew of other luxury brand acquisitions, including of Italian jewelry house Bulgari, LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault is expected to help Tiffany grow outside of the Americas, a market that represents about 41% of the jewelry company's sales today.

LVMH also has a keen eye for product. With Bulgari, for example, LVMH helped make the brand a bigger name in watches and helped refresh its flagship stores.

LVMH is famous for launching designs that can immediately be identified with their brand, like the ""LV"" logo on Louis Vuitton products. Or the Bulgari lettering on Bulgari jewelry. It will likely expand Tiffany's ""T"" and ""key"" designs, and introduce more products that carry Tiffany's iconic logo and coloring.

Given the importance of Chinese zodiac signs to Chinese luxury consumers, LVMH may also consider launching a zodiac-design for Tiffany, as it did with its successful serpent line at Bulgari.

But LVMH on Monday's call pushed back on the idea that it would make Tiffany more expensive by eliminating items like its famous $135 silver lockets.

""There is nothing wrong with an entry price,"" Guiony said, giving LVMH's $35 Dior lipstick as an example. He said what matters is that every item ""reflects the value of the brand."""

The acquisition of Tiffany, which did $4.4 billion in sales in 2018, will roughly double the size of LVMH’s jewelry and watch business, while complementing its 75 other brands spanning fashion, wines and spirits, cosmetics, and more. The deal, LVMH’s largest to date, increases its lead over its rivals. In 2018, it reported €46.8 billion ($51.9 billion) in sales, about three times the €14 billion of Richemont and €13.7 billion of Kering in their most recent fiscal years.

The origins of Louis Vuitton—the “LV” in LVMH and the largest brand in the group—date to 1854, when Louis Vuitton himself started making travel trunks. But the company’s present incarnation really dates to 1977, the year Henry Racamier began running the company. The brand by then was a long-standing symbol of luxury and prestige, but it wasn’t exactly a modern business. It had two stores and annual sales of $14 million, primarily selling luggage and handbags when Odile Vuitton, great grand-daughter of Louis, put her husband, Racamier, in charge. He had made his fortune in the steel industry, and while he didn’t know luxury necessarily, he understood business.

He vertically integrated Louis Vuitton, boosting its profit margins, expanded production, introduced new products, and opened new stores. “In 1984—only seven years after Racamier took over—sales at Vuitton had increased fifteen times, to about $143 million, and profits by almost thirty times, to about $22 million,” wrote Dana Thomas in her book Deluxe: How Luxury Lost Its Luster.

Racamier also took Vuitton public that year. Two years later, the company acquired Veuve Clicquot, the champagne maker and owner of a perfume group. Following that, he arranged the merger of Louis Vuitton and Moët-Hennessy, the wine and spirits group, forming LVMH, already a growing giant. In 1988 it bought fashion house Givenchy.

But in 1990, Racamier quit the company after losing a power struggle with LVMH’s chairman at the time, Alain Chevalier. The ultimate winner of the dispute was Bernard Arnault, the current CEO and chairman, who had aligned himself himself with Chevalier and emerged as the dominant shareholder.

Arnault’s background wasn’t in luxury either, but in 1984, he had managed to take over French textile empire Boussac, owner of Christian Dior. Arnault had set about revitalizing the Dior brand, pulling back its rampant licensing and vertically integrating it. He bought Céline, too, and would eventually integrate both companies into LVMH, though not until 2017 for Dior.

Arnault installed star designers at the company’s fashion brands, such as Marc Jacobs at Louis Vuitton, and used the spectacle of fashion shows to sell high-margin items such as fragrances and handbags. He oversaw a continuing streak of acquisitions, including Berluti in 1993, TAG Heuer in 1999, Fendi in 2001, and Bulgari in 2011 to name just a few. He was even stealthily buying up shares of Hermès before a battle with the Hermès family pushed him to spin them off in 2014.

LVMH’s purchase of Tiffany should help maintain its runaway growth at a moment when the luxury market overall is slowing down. And for Arnault, it’s a shiny new jewel in his crown. According to a research note from Cowen, only a small group of luxury brands have annual sales of more than $3 billion, including Hermès, Gucci, Chanel, and Cartier. LVMH will now own three of them.

Correction: This article has been updated to clarify that LVMH now owns three of a small number of luxury brands with sales of more than $3 billion. A previous version of this article cited Cowen’s research saying there were seven luxury brands with sales of more than $3 billion. There are more than seven such brands."

Shares in the Bernard Arnault-headed group – which owns 75 different brands ranging from fashion houses like Louis Vuitton, Dior, Givenchy, and Fendi to spirits companies, such as Veuve Clicquot and Moet – “are worth more than Europe’s biggest auto maker, Volkswagen AG, and biggest bank, HSBC Holdings,” according to the Wall Street Journal.

Over the past month, LVMH’s share price has grown by more than 5 percent, bringing its market capitalization to $222 billion for the first time ever, and “making it almost as valuable as Europe’s biggest oil producer, Royal Dutch Shell PLC,” the WSJ reported on Thursday. And the maker of Louis Vuitton bags and Fendi furs is not alone in its stock market success: the share prices of its rivals Kering and Hermès have also been on the rise in recent years.

The sizable growth of these luxury players “is a sign of how the luxury business is eclipsing sectors that were once at the core of the European economy,” the WSJ’s Matthew Dalton says. While “banks are struggling to adapt to new post-financial-crisis regulations, auto makers [are] facing declining car sales, [and] big oil companies are subject to the whims of turbulent oil and natural-gas markets,” luxury fashion and accessories brands have been consistently revealing boosted bottom lines across the globe, and reshaping the makeup of the CAC-40, a market capitalization weighted index that reflects the performance of the 40 largest and most actively traded shares listed on Euronext Paris, in the process.

The latest display of LVMH’s growing might comes almost 2 and a half years after it became France’s biggest company by market value, “a mantle energy giant Total SA and drugmaker Sanofi SA had shared for almost a decade” thanks to a 200 percent rise in value since the start of 2016, Bloomberg reported. Meanwhile, Gucci’s parent company Kering – which was situated in the number 7 spot on the CAC-40 – was proving to be similarly noteworthy, as it its stock recorded an increase of more than 33 percent, the largest increase for 2017 on the index.

Such growth by the luxury titan is “reshaping the French benchmark [index], long the realm of energy, infrastructure, financial and telecommunications stocks,” with France’s two biggest luxury giants particularly “well managed and more successful than others in attracting new clients globally via e-commerce, without cannibalizing their traditional business,” Christian Guyot, analyst at Invest Securities in Paris, said at the time.

As for whether LVMH, Kering and Hermès – which occupy three of the top seven spots by market cap on the CAC-40, “ahead of BNP Paribas, France’s largest bank, and AXA SA, the country’s largest insurer,” according to the WSJ – can maintain their hold on the market as a whole, Bernstein & Co. analyst Luca Solca is optimistic, saying that “as long as global market conditions support a larger and larger audience of consumers who are interested in and capable of buying luxury goods, LVMH is in a great position.”

Given that the luxury goods giant “often serves as a canary in the coal mine for how other fashion brands are performing,” as Markets Insider put it last month, its closest rivals will likely also continue to fare well, especially since, as Dalton notes, the fashion industry’s conglomerates “appear to have gained an advantage compared with single-brand houses because their labels can share know-how and pool costs in areas such as marketing, logistics and real estate.”

And if the recent acquisition talks between LVMH and Tiffany & Co. are any indication, the consolidation of brands and groups will likely only continue, thereby, boosting the prowess of those at the top."

Paris-based LVMH, led by billionaire Bernard Arnault, says the deal will strengthen its position in high-end jewelry and in the U.S. market. The purchase gives the French conglomerate a new star in its already distinctive portfolio - one that will help it compete with Gucci-owner Kering Group and Cartier-owner Richemont SA.

LVMH already owns 75 brands including Christian Dior, Fendi, and Givenchy as well as watchmaker Tag Heuer. Its flagship brand Louis Vuitton recently opened a handbag workshop in Texas, with President Trump in attendance.

LVMH said both companies' boards approved the deal and hope to finalize the takeover in 2020, subject to the approval of regulators and Tiffany shareholders.

The offer comes as luxury goods companies have been wrestling with changing habits of shoppers who are increasingly buying online. They're also purchasing second-hand luxury items from places like The RealReal.com.

In addition, luxury companies are facing fears of an economic slowdown in China, a key area of business, while they're already dealing with a slowdown in international tourism in the U.S.

Under its CEO Alessandro Bogliolo, Tiffany is trying to appeal to younger shoppers with more modern takes on jewelry. Earlier this year, it launched a men's jewelry collection, and it's increasing its marketing to a more diverse customer base like same-sex couples. It's also been renovating its flagship store in Manhattan.

Still, Tiffany's U.S. sales have been stagnating as China's slowing economy has weighed on spending by Chinese tourists, who make up a substantial portion of luxury spending. The strong dollar has also made Tiffany products more expensive for consumers outside the U.S.

Tiffany has been putting plans in place to appeal to a younger group of customers who are more used to shopping online and hunting for fashion deals. Tiffany has notably highlighted ways customers can personalize jewelry and started letting people trace the origin of their diamonds.

Tiffany had sales of $4.4 billion in 2018, an increase of nearly 7% over 2017. LVMH reported 6.3 billion euros in profits in 2018 on 46.8 billion euros in sales."

LVMH Is Now the Second-Most Valuable Company in Europe: How Did That Happen? - The Business of Fashion,"Tue, 05 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvbHZtaC1lMjAwLWJpbGxpb24tc2Vjb25kLWxhcmdlc3QtY29tcGFueS1ldXJvcGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — Energy stocks used to be the safe bet, now it's handbags and shoes.

Case in point: The market capitalisation of LVMH, which owns fashion brands including Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton and Celine, passed the €200 billion mark on the Paris Stock Exchange this week. Earlier this year, the French luxury group moved ahead of Anheuser-Busch and Unilever to become the second-largest company in the eurozone following oil and gas company Royal Dutch Shell.

The €200 billion milestone marks an excellent year for LVMH, which has seen its shares jump more than 50 percent. (Shell's shares are flat over the same period.) It is now three times bigger than arch rival Kering (which has a market cap of €65.7 billion) and five times as big as Richemont, which is currently valued at about €40.8 billion. The conglomerate's Chairman and Chief Executive, Bernard Arnault, was named the second-richest man in the world this year by Forbes, which estimated his net worth to be over $103 billion.

Why has LVMH’s value increased so much this year?

The short answer is that LVMH has built such a large and diverse portfolio of luxury brands that investors see its success as practically a foregone conclusion. Some analysts have even described the company as undervalued.

“The desirability of LVMH's key brands currently remains very high; this should allow the group to continue to grow consistently and profitably,” wrote Edouard Aubin, a Morgan Stanley analyst, in a May research note. “With the stock trading at a discount to a number of other high-quality global consumer growth names, we see the stock's valuation as attractive.”

LVMH was formed in 1987, with the merger of Louis Vuitton and the wine and spirits group Moët & Chandon and Hennessy, and has acquired numerous brands since then. Aubin said that LVMH’s ability to increase the desirability of its 70-plus brands over the long term has set the group up to outperform competitors in all five divisions: wine and spirits, fashion and leather goods, perfume and cosmetics, watches and fine jewellery and finally, selective retailing, which includes airport shops and Sephora.

The conglomerate's diverse portfolio and sheer size give it key advantages over the rest of the industry, too. In luxury fashion, only Kering, LVMH's closest-in-size competitor, along with a few strong independent companies — Hermès and Chanel — can operate on a similarly global scale, creating an environment where smaller groups and standalone fashion brands are struggling to thrive.

In 2018, LVMH generated €10 billion in profit on recurring operations, up 21 percent over the previous year, while Kering made €3.9 billion in operating profit, up 46.6 percent. Not only do these category leaders have more money to spend on marketing and advertising, opening physical stores and improving their e-commerce experience, but they’ve also moved their operations further upstream, buying factories, tanneries — even alligator farms — so that they can control the entire luxury supply chain, boxing competitors out.

And, in terms of scale, LVMH is far ahead of everyone, allowing it to capture a significant share of the €270 billion global market for personal luxury goods.

With such a diverse portfolio, LVMH can take its time developing trickier-to-market brands — such as the little-known-but-historic Patou label — while ramping up growth where consumer interest is high. For instance, Rihanna's Fenty beauty label hit nearly €500 million in sales in just over a year. Not only was it developed in-house by LVMH's Kendo beauty incubator, but it was also distributed widely at LVMH-owned Sephora stores, meaning that LVMH controlled the entire process.

LVMH has also remained fairly insulated from the slowdown in China spending. Sales in Asia (excluding Japan) were up 12 percent in the third quarter of the year, with LVMH citing strong performance across the region despite the ongoing political unrest in Hong Kong.

It has also dodged the overall ""cooling"" of the global economy, spurred by trade tensions between the US and China — as well as the US and Europe. While the US has enforced new tariffs on many goods imported from Europe, including wine, several of LVMH's top revenue drivers — including handbags and Champagne — have been spared. A recent meeting between Arnault and US President Donald Trump at a newly opened Louis Vuitton factory in Texas spurred controversy, viewed by many as a tactic to keep in the good graces of the president, whose policy-making has often been driven by personal relationships.

What will LVMH's grandness allow it to do next? First off, it is well-positioned to acquire more brands, as illustrated by its October 2019 offer to buy American jeweller Tiffany & Co. for $14.5 billion. While the deal is nowhere near done — Tiffany is likely to field other bids in order to hike up its own stock price and increase shareholder value — the offer shows LVMH's ability to increase its cash flow. (Tiffany generated $4.4 billion in revenue in 2018.)

""LVMH is in a unique position to lead the next stages of consolidation in the sector,"" said Bruno-Roland Bernard, a finance professor at Institut Français de la Mode.

But it is getting too big? After the group's 2011 acquisition of Bulgari, which valued the Italian fine jewellery house at €3.7 billion, the European Commission investigated whether the consolidation would make it too difficult for others to compete in the category. The group subsequently cleared the merger, although LVMH is a much bigger company now — and Tiffany is a much more expensive purchase. But while analysts expect another antitrust review if the deal does indeed go through, they also think LVMH will once again be cleared.

""Jewellery is highly fragmented, so I don’t expect any problem,” Luca Solca, a luxury analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Schweiz, said in an email.

If LVMH does remain fairly untouchable, will a competitor ever be able to catch up? A merger between Richemont and Kering could be the answer, although that's unlikely to materialise. For now, however, the market leader continues to dominate. Until, of course, it doesn't.

Bernard Arnault’s luxury goods empire, with brands such as Louis Vuitton, Dior and Moët & Chandon, announced it had agreed to pay $135 a share in cash.

LVMH said the deal would transform its watches and jewellery division, which includes Bulgari, TAG Heuer and Hublot, and boost its presence in the US. It is the latest addition to the group’s 75 big brands, known as “maisons” or houses.

The French company wants to to restore shine to Tiffany, whose revenues have slowed due to lower tourist spending. Founded in 1837 when Charles Lewis Tiffany opened the first store in downtown Manhattan, New York, the US jeweller now has more than 300 stores worldwide and employs more than 14,000 people.

Its flagship store featured in the film Breakfast at Tiffany’s, where Audrey Hepburn’s Holly Golightly character mused “nothing very bad could happen to you”. Tiffany’s engagement and wedding rings range from £1,400 for a platinum band to £43,400 for a double-halo ring with pink diamonds. It also sells sterling silver rings starting at £155, with a “love heart ring” priced at £310.

It is LVMH’s biggest takeover under the 32-year reign of Arnault, its 70-year-old chairman, chief executive and majority shareholder, who has amassed a vast number of wine, spirit, fashion, leather, perfume, cosmetics and watch brands ranging from Dom Pérignon, Veuve Clicquot and Krug champagne to Givenchy, Kenzo and Marc Jacobs fashion.

Arnault, Europe’s richest man, said: “We have an immense respect and admiration for Tiffany and intend to develop this jewel with the same dedication and commitment that we have applied to each and every one of our maisons.

“We will be proud to have Tiffany sit alongside our iconic brands and look forward to ensuring that Tiffany continues to thrive for centuries to come.”

Hard luxury – watches and jewellery – is one of the fastest-growing areas and is the only sector where LVMH is not leader. The Tiffany deal will enable it to challenge Cartier owner Richemont’s dominance. The world’s biggest luxury groups have been buying up smaller brands as they compete for younger customers and high-spending Chinese consumers. Tiffany is a well-recognised jewellery brand in China.

Rogerio Fujimori, an analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland, said: “Tiffany makes sense for LVMH because of the scarcity of acquisition targets with global scale and brand appeal in jewellery, the least crowded category in the luxury sector.

“Tiffany could be highly complementary to LVMH’s hard luxury portfolio because Tiffany has a broader consumer base than Bulgari thanks to its higher exposure to more affordable price points given its well-established silver jewellery offer.”

LVMH first approached Tiffany in late October with a $14.5bn bid but this was rejected as too low. The higher offer has been approved by the boards of both companies and still needs the backing of shareholders. The deal is expected to be completed in the middle of next year.

Anusha Couttigane, fashion and luxury goods analyst at data consultancy Kantar, said: “Should the bid go through, we can expect to see aggressive marketing and collaborations with interesting designers, of which LVMH has many to choose from.”

Alessandro Bogliolo, the Tiffany chief executive and a former LVMH executive, said: “As part of the LVMH group, Tiffany will reach new heights, capitalising on its remarkable internal expertise, unparalleled craftsmanship and strong cultural values.”"
Former LVMH Executive Spells Out 'Aesthetic Intelligence' in New Book - WWD,"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2Zvcm1lci1sdm1oLWV4ZWN1dGl2ZS1zcGVsbHMtb3V0LWFlc3RoZXRpYy1pbnRlbGxpZ2VuY2UtaW4tbmV3LWJvb2stMTIwMzM2OTUwOS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Twenty-five years in the luxury sector clued Pauline Brown into all sorts of sensibilities, and her new book “Aesthetic Intelligence: How to Boost It and Use It in Business and Beyond” spells out some of them.

For her first book, the former chairman of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton North America has culled from the interdisciplinary course “The Business of Aesthetics” that she taught at the Harvard Business School in 2016 and 2017. The 219-page book, which is due out Nov. 26, draws from case studies and real-life experiences. Jo Malone, Iris Apfel, Chobani, Dyson, MAC Cosmetics and Harley-Davidson are among the myriad brands referenced. While the subject matter is prime for the fashion and retail crowd, Brown is hopeful that readers from other industries will be inclined to leaf through.

“There are thousands of examples that I could give you. It could be the manager of a doctor’s office, who [asks] why a patient or a family couldn’t have more of a lifting or human experience in a waiting room,” said Brown, adding that could be further incentive to go there beyond medical treatment.

The book is also meant to highlight the value of design and the potential for return on investment even for those in creative industries. “If you think about the Fortune 1000, and the profiles of the ceo’s, the majority of them will have studied finance, economics — some of them engineering and maybe operations — but very few would have studied fine arts or art history. I’m not saying the ceo doesn’t need to be facile in finance or engineering. Shouldn’t he or she also be facile in departments that might in the long term make a bigger difference than those that can be outsourced to AI or computers?” asked Brown, who is now an executive in residence at Columbia University’s Business School.

Some early readers of the book have surprised Brown with their a-ha reactions to what she considers pretty basic. As a businessperson, “who lived between the worlds of commerce and design for much of her career,” Brown’s favorite lines included, “You don’t have to teach a baby or a child how to enjoy ice cream. There are so many aspects of aesthetic delight that are so fundamental and universal.”

Sensory overload seems status quo, given that the average U.S. consumer reportedly sees upward of 4,000 images a day. “We live in an age where we talk so much about big data, microprocessing and efficiency. We’ve been almost brainwashed to think that the world functions in this industrial economy,” Brown said. “We have kind of come out of this era where we’re consumed with what is different today than 10 to 20 years ago. We’re consumed with social media. We’re consumed with automation, and yet 99 percent of the elements that make us human haven’t changed in a hundred years.”

While teaching at Harvard, Brown said she had a few epiphanies and recognized “the power of the business of aesthetics.” What she hadn’t known was how broad the student interest would be. Although marketing, branding and luxury management students’ interest was expected, the enrollment of technology-minded, aspiring hedge fund-ers and nonbusiness school students was a surprise, she said. While her two-year run at HBS allowed her to work with 100 students each year, Brown knew that writing a book would reach far more people. “The interest from the student body said to me that there is something here that is more powerful than I even thought. And the business world and the business schools that are generating the next generation of leaders are looking for new ways of understanding and framing the marketplace,” she said.

While no one needs reminding that consumer behavior, retail, and even the definition of what constitutes a brand have changed drastically in the past few decades, Brown said the language that businesses and business schools are using hasn’t changed that dramatically since she graduated from Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.

Mindful of not confusing aesthetics with beauty, design or artistry, Brown said aesthetics comes from the Greek word “aisthetikos,” which has to do with other senses. “Everyone is born with five senses and we used to use them for survival. Now we use them largely for pleasure and human sensibilities. I would argue that in a world where we are spending so many hours in a digital mind-set, that our human senses are thirsting to be activated.” she said. “We are fairly visual as a society, although digital is not a rich visual experience because it’s two-dimensional. But most of our senses are pretty numbed by the lifestyle that we lead — the fact that we are overcome with data and technological input and we live in cities where we are overcome by noise and smells and things. In the process, because we haven’t used them, we’ve actually neglected them.”

First and foremost, aesthetic intelligence is about tapping into our individual senses, and then understanding what the emotions are in association with them, Brown said. “People with really good taste don’t just know the difference between what tastes good or what tastes bad, or what looks good or what looks bad, but they know how it makes them feel. There is a whole spectrum of things that can be associated with different sensorial stimuli.”

Steve Jobs’ ability to articulate what felt good to him and how thousands of people should execute around that aesthetic vision was “part of his genius,” the author said. But curation is another element that is needed to execute aesthetic intelligence, she said. “Above all, it’s about tapping into our own taste levels and applying it to business — whatever business we’re in. We’re not only providing an experience for the receiver but we’re also communicating a sensibility that is probably our only differentiation. Otherwise, we’re all selling commodities if we’re not tapping into what makes us different. That, as we all know, is a race to the bottom.”

Early indicators show that “Aesthetic Intelligence” has international appeal, considering that publishing houses in Japan, India and Korea have signed deals."
How LVMH might grow Tiffany & Co. - Vogue Business,"Fri, 01 Nov 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9sdm1oLXRpZmZhbnktYW5kLWNvLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9uLWNoaW5h0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Key takeaways:

Tiffany & Co. is in the middle of a brand repositioning, but its financial performance still lags.

The US brand makes significant revenue from accessible silver jewellery, complicating LVMH’s ability to replicate Bulgari’s playbook of focusing on core, high-end lines.

Tiffany has significant brand recognition in China’s relatively unpenetrated jewellery market, though it faces competition from homegrown brands.

Tiffany’s board is expected to reject LVMH’s initial offer to buy the company at $120 a share, or $14.5 billion. The prospect of a purchase has already sent the New York jeweller’s shares up to nearly $130, and many expect LVMH will need to up its offer by as much as 30 per cent for the board to bite.

The prospective acquisition has drawn parallels to LVMH’s €3.7 billion purchase of Bulgari in 2011. The French group paid 28 times trailing EBITDA for its last fine jewellery acquisition whereas the Tiffany’s offer translates to about 14x EBITDA. LVMH has had success transforming the fortunes of the Italian jeweller, reportedly more than doubling the €1.1 billion in revenue Bulgari last registered as an independent company.

But the Bulgari transformation may be an easier task than what lies ahead with Tiffany. Bernstein analyst Luca Solca wrote in a note that Tiffany is already producing an EBIT margin of 18 per cent versus Bulgari’s 8 per cent in 2010 so there are fewer obvious routes to improve its earnings.

Repositioning the brand

Tiffany is one of the only internationally recognised jewellery brands, with revenue of over $4 billion. A purchase would double LVMH’s hard luxury revenue, taking significant market share away from rival Richemont, while giving it an additional foothold in the US.

Tiffany CEO Alessandro Boglio, who worked at Bulgari until shortly after the LVMH takeover, has done a lot of brand repositioning work since taking over in July 2017. Since coming on board, he has worked with Tiffany’s first chief artistic officer, Reed Krakoff, to modernise the brand’s look. Krakoff covered over New York City bodegas in the company’s iconic blue and enlisted Lady Gaga to wear the 128-carat Tiffany yellow diamond on the Oscars red carpet this year. The company also opened a well-received cafe in its Fifth Avenue flagship. Despite this work, there has been little improvement in Tiffany’s balance sheet — comparable sales were down 2 per cent in the first half of 2019 on a constant exchange rate basis."

But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. For example, the LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne (EPA:MC) share price has soared 193% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. And in the last month, the share price has gained 5.3%. But the price may well have benefitted from a buoyant market, since stocks have gained 6.2% in the last thirty days.

Check out our latest analysis for LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne

There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.

Over half a decade, LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne managed to grow its earnings per share at 14% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 24% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.

It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne's earnings, revenue and cash flow.

What About Dividends?

As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne the TSR over the last 5 years was 260%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!

A Different Perspective

We're pleased to report that LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 49% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 29% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently.

LVMH reaches deal to acquire Tiffany for $16.3 billion - CNBC,"Sun, 24 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTkvMTEvMjQvbHZtaC1yZWFjaGVzLWRlYWwtdG8tYWNxdWlyZS10aWZmYW55LWZvci0xNnBvaW50My1iaWxsaW9uLmh0bWzSAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAxOS8xMS8yNC9sdm1oLXJlYWNoZXMtZGVhbC10by1hY3F1aXJlLXRpZmZhbnktZm9yLTE2cG9pbnQzLWJpbGxpb24uaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bulgari owner LVMH has reached a deal to buy Tiffany & Co. at $135 a share in cash, or $16.3 billion, according to sources familiar with the matter.

The boards of the luxury firms have been discussing a potential deal since last month, and will meet on Sunday to approve the deal, sources tell CNBC's David Faber.

An agreement could be announced as soon as Monday.

Shares of Tiffany, the iconic New York-based jeweler, have risen over hopes of a higher priced deal. Shares closed on Friday at $125.51. They had traded at about $140 in the middle of last year.

Jewelry was one of the strongest performing areas of the luxury industry in 2018, according to consultancy Bain & Co, which forecast that comparable sales in the $20 billion global market were set to grow 7% this year.

Tiffany, founded in New York in 1837 and featured in the 1961 movie ""Breakfast at Tiffany's,"" has struggled with growth over the last several years. It experienced falling annual sales and profit since 2015, before a revenue turnaround in 2017.

The jeweler has also pushed an expansion into China, but experienced a decline in sales in the U.S. and Asia from factors like the U.S.-China trade war.

Analysts at Credit Suisse and Cowen say Tiffany could be worth roughly $140-$160 per share.

Paris-based LMVH has about $50 billion in annual revenue from brands including Louis Vuitton and Dom Perignon. Acquiring Tiffany would give LVMH exposure to the bridal and diamond category and to more U.S. luxury customers.

LVMH plans to keep the Bulgari and Tiffany's brands separate if the deal materializes. The company's primary rivals, including Gucci-owner Kering and Switzerland's Richemont, which owns Cartier, are also increasing their exposure to high-end jewelry.

The Financial Times first reported news that LVMH and Tiffany reached a deal.

LVMH's Arnault Could Soon Be the World's Richest Person - PEOPLE,"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS9odW1hbi1pbnRlcmVzdC9sdm1oLWJlcm5hcmQtYXJuYXVsdC1jb3VsZC1zb29uLWJlLXJpY2hlc3QtcGVyc29uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bernard Arnault, the French billionaire and head of luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, is closing in on the title of world’s richest person after his company agreed to purchase Tiffany & Company in a $16 billion deal on Monday.

The 70-year-old businessman — who serves as chairman of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, indisputably the world’s largest luxury company — is now worth $106.8 billion, according to Forbes.

Arnault’s net worth rose by 1 percent after the takeover of the iconic American company was announced. Tiffany was made a household name by the 1961 Audrey Hepburn film, Breakfast at Tiffany’s, based on the novel by Truman Capote.

LVMH — of which Arnault and his family own more than 47%, per CNN — now claims more than 70 luxury brands under its umbrella, including Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Celine, Bulgari, Hublot, TAG Heuer, and Dom Perignon champagne, according to Fortune.

The purchase places Arnault just (billions) shy of the two wealthiest people in the world, Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

Forbe’s “Real-Time Billionaires List,” which tracks the net worth of the richest people in the world, placed Gates at $107 billion and Bezos at $110.2 billion on Monday. Warren Buffet, Mark Zuckerberg and Larry Ellison round out the top six wealthiest people.

According to the New York Times, Arnault first began his accumulation of companies in the 1980s, when he purchased a bankrupt French textile company called Boussac. He sold most of the company but kept one piece, Dior, and expanded it.

The newspaper says Arnault has a reputation for being extremely competitive and wanted to own the top luxury company when he realized he couldn’t be No. 1 in his two other passions, piano and tennis.

He has two children from his first marriage, and three from his second. Four of them work for various brands owned by LVMH."
LVMH Acquires Tiffany and Co. For $16.2 Billion - ELLE,"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsbGUuY29tL2Zhc2hpb24vc2hvcHBpbmcvYTI5OTUwMjAwL2x2bWgtYWNxdWlyZXMtdGlmZmFueS1hbmQtY28v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Iconic jewelry label Tiffany and Co. has officially joined the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton family after a bidding war that culminated in the luxury goods group acquiring the jeweler for a whopping $16.2 billion.

According to WWD, LVMH latest move marks the group's biggest purchase to date. LVMH's acquisition of the 182-year-old luxury house ""will strengthen LVMH’s position in jewelry and further increase its presence in the United States,"" the brand explained in a statement released this morning, November 25, adding that Tiffany will help to strengthen LVMH's jewelry division and other luxury brands. LVMH was bidding against Richemont, the Swedish luxury goods holding company behind Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels, and Piaget, among others.

Tiffany and Co. was founded in 1837 and became famous for its robin's egg blue boxes. Audrey Hepburn also helped to put the luxury jeweler on the map, thanks to her Breakfast at Tiffany's character Holly Golightly who dined at the famed location in the movie.

""We are delighted to have the opportunity to welcome Tiffany, a company with an unparalleled heritage and unique position in the global jewelry world, to the LVMH family,"" LVMH CEO Bernaud Arnault added. ""We have an immense respect and admiration for Tiffany and intend to develop this jewel with the same dedication and commitment that we have applied to each and every one of our Maisons. We will be proud to have Tiffany sit alongside our iconic brands and look forward to ensuring that Tiffany continues to thrive for centuries to come.""

Tiffany and Co. joins LVMH houses Celine, Christian Dior, Emilio Pucci, Fendi, FENTY, Givenchy, Kenzo, as well as the company's jewelry division, which includes Bvlgari, Chaumet, Hublot and more.

Acquiring Tiffany Could Be a China Masterstroke for LVMH - Jing Daily,"Fri, 01 Nov 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9hY3F1aXJpbmctdGlmZmFueS1jb3VsZC1iZS1hLWNoaW5hLW1hc3RlcnN0cm9rZS1mb3ItbHZtaNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Taking over headlines this week is the news that French luxury giant LVMH — owner of brands such as the titular Louis Vuitton and Moët Hennessy, Loewe, Céline , Christian Dior, and Rimowa — is in talks to potentially acquire American jeweler Tiffany & Co. for US14.5 billion, the latest example of an ongoing consolidation that is reshaping the global luxury industry. (And pitting LVMH directly against its closest rivals, Kering and Richemont.)

A Tiffany acquisition would bring both near- and longer-term benefits for the sprawling LVMH empire. The immediate impact would be a boost to the group’s footprint in the U.S., which currently makes up around 25 percent of LVMH revenue. Rolling up Tiffany would also increase LVMH’s watches and jewelry roster, which — despite including Hublot and TAG Heuer — accounts for less than 10 percent of group revenue, and arguably lags behind Richemont’s portfolio, which boasts the likes of A. Lange & Söhne, Jaeger-LeCoultre, and Cartier.

Both companies have been quick to point out that the deal is still very much in the discussion phase, with LVMH only staying it has held ""preliminary discussions"" in regard to a ""possible transaction"" with Tiffany. However, if it does go through, it could end up being one of LVMH’s smartest China-facing transactions to date.

China has long been a critical market for Tiffany and Chinese consumers — whether shopping at home or abroad — are some of the brand’s biggest buyers and most loyal customers. This is particularly true among the country’s middle and upper-middle classes, who have been aggressively courted over the past decade, particularly as Tiffany has sought to link itself strongly with the fast-growing bridal and wedding jewelry segment in mainland China.

Tiffany currently operates around 35 stores in mainland China and another 10 in Hong Kong. Like many brands, Tiffany has seen its Hong Kong revenue crimped by protests and plummeting mainland Chinese tourist arrivals over the past six months. In the U.S., Tiffany has also seen a drop in Chinese tourist-shoppers, in large part due to yuan depreciation and the effects of the U.S.-China trade war. As such, the company has increased its efforts and investment in China this year, renovating its Shanghai flagship and focusing on store renovation and expansion, as well as e-commerce functionality.

Where Tiffany really shines and could benefit LVMH is in its market penetration in the U.S., as well as in most of the destinations frequented by Chinese tourist-shoppers, and its strong and strengthening brick-and-mortar and online footprint in China. Brand awareness is extremely high throughout China, and its accessible price point makes it an entry-level brand for the middle class. Tiffany’s sprawling product mix, ranging from relatively inexpensive charms or keychains up to multi-carat engagement rings and watches, helps it access a wide swath of Chinese consumers.

Snapping up Tiffany would open the door even wider for LVMH to capitalize on Chinese consumer spending both in mainland China (where an increasing number of luxury shoppers are choosing to make their purchases) and North America, building its hard luxury revenue from Chinese tourists, students, and recent immigrants who look to buy brands “at the source.”

LVMH is already a dominant position at the higher end of the luxury market. Increasing its holdings of more accessible American brands like Tiffany, which would join recent acquisition Fenty, Marc Jacobs, Kat Von D Beauty, and Benefit Cosmetics, would put them in a position to court the Chinese consumer from entry-level to high-end, and making the group’s hold on the global luxury market that much stronger."
"Two Decades, a Bitter Legal Battle, and More than $1 Billion Later, LVMH's La Samaritaine is (Almost) Ready for its ... - The Fashion Law","Thu, 21 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVmYXNoaW9ubGF3LmNvbS90d28tZGVjYWRlcy1hLWxlZ2FsLWJhdHRsZS1hbmQtbW9yZS10aGFuLTEtYmlsbGlvbi1sYXRlci1sdm1ocy1sYS1zYW1hcml0YWluZS1pcy1yZWFkeS1mb3ItaXRzLWRlYnV0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A $1 billion-plus shopping mecca “for the super-rich” was slated to welcome the public into its glitzy enclave dab-smack in the heart of Paris in the spring of 2020. The property of luxury goods conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, La Samaritaine – a sweeping 152-year old shopping destination located steps from the Seine, a short stroll from the main courtyard of the Louvre, and not terribly far from in-the-midst-of-rebuild Notre Dame – revealed that it would open its doors almost two decades after the mighty LVMH first swooped in with its deep pockets and grand plans to revamp the iconic site and 16 years after the shopping center was forced to go dark due to its failure to meet various significant building safety codes.

When La Samaritaine opens to the public for the first time in 16 years (the date of which has been pushed back on more than one occasion, in part as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic), Paris-based LVMH plans to use it to “grab a greater slice of tourist spending in Paris,” according to Bloomberg. Thanks to offerings from “more than 600 brands,” the result of a partnership between LVMH and duty-free retailer DFS, as well as a 5-star hotel (going nightly rates are expected to top $1,270), a Christian Dior-branded spa, apartments, and a swathe of ritzy restaurants, the Samaritaine is expected to draw “several millions of visitors per year.”

Any impending shopping or spa-ing or restaurant-going that unfolds under La Samaritaine’s art nouveau glass roof and amidst its resorted Belle Epoque glamour does not come without a history of striking squabbles that left the future of the cluster of four magasins in Paris’ First Arrondissement in limbo for years. The back-and-forth surrounding the project was so drawn out and at times, unpredictable, that when LVMH’s chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony hosted some of the earliest invitees to the space in November 2019, he welcomed them with the caveat, “There were times when I wondered if I would ever be able to say those words.”

Despite years of sets backs and the onset of a global health pandemic that has brought most overseas travel to a screeching halt, and the complications that have come with that, LVMH’s plan to restore La Samaritaine came simply enough in the late 1990s, early 2000s. Fresh off a successful endeavor to acquire and refurbish/rebrand the now-nearly 200-year old Le Bon Marché – Paris’ first department store – in the mid-to-late 1980s and turn it into what the group calls one of “the most exclusive shops in Paris,” LVMH was seemingly looking to further bolster its real estate footprint close to home.

So, the Bernard Arnault-run conglomerate – now 33 years old and the owner of approximately 75 brands, ranging from Louis Vuitton and Dior to Moet & Chandon and Veuve Clicquot – set its sights on La Samaritaine and acquired a 55 percent stake in the company (and its real estate) in 2001 for €256 million. Noting the appeal of the property in its 20-F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for 2002, LVMH described the Samaritaine as “one of the first and most emblematic department stores in Paris,” situated in “a high-growth strategic district [that] attracts both local customers and has a high potential with international visitors.”

LVMH’s Plans

When LVMH entered into the picture, the department store, which had been operating at a loss since the 1970s, was certainly in need of a revamp. And LVMH – in the midst of building what would unquestionably become the most valuable luxury goods conglomerate in the world – could certainly provide support. By the end of 2002, the group asserted in an SEC filing that “with its help, La Samaritaine [had] developed a new growth strategy and started repositioning itself in the fashion and accessories sector, all in order to increase the franchise’s appeal to younger customers with strong purchasing power and at the leading edge of fashion trends.”

But LVMH’s plans – which included renovating the Samaritaine’s famed grands magasins while keeping the department store open in furtherance of what it forecasted as “steady growth for [the business] beginning in 2003” – would come to an abrupt halt before then. In June 2005, just a few years after its initial acquisition, the department store was forced to close, with city officials citing a host of safety issues in connection with the steel and glass portion of the main Samaritaine outpost, (i.e., Magasin 1).

That, however, was only the tip of the iceberg of what was to come.

The department store’s closure – quite possibly “for several years” due to the need for “urgent” and expansive renovations – was met with “staged sit-ins by hundreds of employees on the last day of trading amid fears that the store’s owner LVMH [would] decide not to reopen it,” the Globe & Mail reported at the time. While LVMH denied any plans to “close the store for good and convert the building into office space,” it went back to the drawing board, nonetheless.

What LVMH returned with was a $500 million-plus plan to transform the grand structure and its various corresponding buildings into mixed-use space. It would keep some of the department store alive via an array of branded stores, while adding offices, a luxury hotel, and social housing. The arguably innovative idea did not find favor amongst one major player in the equation: La Samaritaine’s minority shareholder, the Cognacq-Jay Foundation, a charitable fund set up by Samaritaine’s founders Ernest Cognacq and Louise Jay in 1916.

The two sides butted heads over what the future would look like for the sweeping space that first opened in 1869 at the center of the city’s most tourist-heavy district and which was named a historic national monument by the French Ministry of Culture 121 years later in 1990.

After “fighting firmly for a new Samaritaine department store more in line with their founder’s mission,” including an emphasis on “helping businesses to engage with the social sector,” representatives for the Cognacq-Jay Foundation – which ultimately held a 40.6 percent stake in the business to LVMH’s 59.4 percent” – “walked out of talks to reopen the distinctive building in protest of what it called the irresponsible attitude of LVMH,” the Guardian revealed in December 2008.

The Foundation’s president Georges Renand formalized the move in “a stinging letter,” alerting La Samariatine’s then-president (and the former chairman of Le Bon Marché) Philippe de Beauvoir that the Foundation would no longer participate in negotiations about the future use of the iconic site. The Foundation then proceeded to declare in a public-facing statement that the“resignation reflects our deep and fundamental disagreement with the majority shareholder … on the future of Samaritaine.”

“We are letting the majority shareholder” – LVMH – “take sole responsibility for its decisions, which have in any case always been made despite our opposition,” the Foundation declared.

A Short-Lived Victory

The messy working relationship between the two entities would sort itself out by 2010 when LVMH bought out the Cognacq-Jay Foundation’s stake, thereby, becoming the sole owner, and things began to look up. In December 2012, LVMH was granted the necessary building permits it had been waiting on for more than a year in order to transform the Seine-facing and Rue de Rivoli sides of La Samaritaine. That victory was short-lived, though. Within two months of the permits being granted, an appeal was lodged about the work that LVMH was planning to do on the two sides of the Samaritaine.

It turns out, as LVMH was preparing to break ground on its masterpiece, someone was waiting to stop them. Alexandre Gady – the president of the Society for the Protection of Landscapes and Aesthetics in France at the time and “perhaps the preeminent historian of Paris of his generation,” in the words of the New Yorker – was that someone. To put a stop to the Samaritaine-specific alteration of the city’s historic center, he initiated legal proceedings, including two formal requests for cancellation of the Seine and Rue de Rivoli permits.

Gady, along with heritage groups Society for the Protection of Landscapes and Aesthetics and SOS Paris, argued that the city of Paris was not considering its urban planning regulations when it granted the permits to LVMH. In accordance with those regulations, any new construction must take into account the characteristics of the facades of neighboring buildings, as well as the facade of the building it is replacing. LVMH’s plans for La Samaritaine – including the nearly $500 million redevelopment planned by Japanese architect duo SANAA, which would see the demolition of several structures at the rear of the Samaritaine site and the replacement of a facade that stretched for almost an entire block with “a set of etched glass waves” – did not fit the bill.

In fact, not only did LVMH’s plans – which would serve to “merge multiple structures, built between the 1600s and the 1930s and progressively annexed to the Art Nouveau,” per Bloomberg – not fit the bill, in the eyes of the groups, they also argued that such large-scale alterations would “distort the center of Paris.” On the other hand, LVMH, developers, and a select politician or two, including the then-new mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo pointed to the “boon” that the revamped destination would provide for the local economy.

The matter would make its way in and out of various courts in Paris between late 2012 and the summer of 2015, with LVMH winning some rounds, and Gady and Co. landing victories in others, such as a favorable decision from the Tribunal Administratif, a French administrative court, which rejected LVMH’s permit for the Rue de Rivoli construction in January 2015.

In response to being handed the unfavorable Rue de Rivoli decision, Arnault – who holds the title of the richest man in France (and the second richest in the entire world) – told Reuters that his group would not back down, and instead, would escalate the matter to France’s supreme administrative court, and that is exactly what LVMH did. After all, such legal quandaries were hardly unchartered terrain for LVMH; construction for the Frank Gehry-designed Fondation Louis Vuitton, for instance, stretched over 8 years, in large part thanks to formal resistance (and legal proceedings) from the Coordination for the Safeguarding of the Bois de Boulogne. It would prove to take years, sizable legal bills, and the passage of a special national French law for that cultural epicenter to come into fruition.

However, just as in the case of the Fondation Louis Vuitton, LVMH and its chairman ultimately got their way for La Samaritaine.

Bringing Modernity to Paris

In June 2015, just over a year after Tribunal Administratif approved the permit for the construction on the Seine-facing side of the property, a decision from the Conseil d’Etat – the highest court in France for issues and cases involving matters of public administration – approved the building permit for the renovation of the building located on Rue de Rivoli. According to the Conseil d’Etat, the lower courts had interpreted city planning regulations far too strictly, so much so that nearly any contemporary or innovative project could never be allowed, something that would not be in anyone’s interest.

“We need to know how to bring modernity to this city, and modernity is not the enemy of heritage,” Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said in a statement on the heels of the court’s decision. “Nostalgia is a nice engine for a city, but creation is also a good one.”

LVMH’s ambitious plan could proceed … in its entirety, and the group declared the news in a widely-circulated press release. “Ten years after the closure of La Samaritaine for safety reasons and after many years of litigation, these two permits are therefore now irrevocable,” LVMH announced. “La Samaritaine is preparing to resume this ambitious project for the restoration and renovation of the entire site. The three years of works should generate around 1800 jobs.” Overall, the group proclaimed, once the site is renovated, “it will directly create more than 2200 jobs.”

Reflecting on the soon-to-reopen La Samaritaine almost two decades after LVMH first brought it under its glitzy umbrella, Jean-Jacques Guiony, who spearheaded much of the effort as the CEO of the Samaritaine business (in addition to his role as the CFO of LVMH), says the hard-fought revamp makes sense. In interviews this month, Guiony said that “the Samaritaine has no architectural unity, which isn’t to say it doesn’t have personality.” With that in mind, “It is fitting that there should be a strong architectural gesture of the 21st century to complete this new incarnation.”

Following pandemic-related delays, La Samaritaine is expected to open to the public on June 19.

LVMH Closes in on its Biggest Deal to Date: $16.2 Billion for Tiffany & Co. - The Fashion Law,"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL2x2bWgtZXhwZWN0ZWQtdG8tY2xvc2UtaXRzLWJpZ2dlc3QtZGVhbC10by1kYXRlLTE2My1iaWxsaW9uLWZvci10aWZmYW55LWFtcC1jby_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton officially closed a deal to buy Tiffany & Co. In a statement on Monday the Paris-based luxury goods conglomerate, which maintains an arsenal of 75 brands, which range from fashion houses like Louis Vuitton, Dior, Givenchy, and Fendi to spirits companies, such as Veuve Clicquot and Moet, confirmed that it will pay a whopping $16.2 billion for the American jewelry giant, following from reports that it had upped its offer from the initial unsolicited $14.5 billion bid it made last month, which the board for the 182-year old New York-based jewelry company reportedly rejected.

The deal’s price tag – which sees the Bernard Arnault-led LVMH paying $135 for each outstanding Tiffany & Co. share in cash for a total of $16.2 billion – is up from the $130 per share offer reportedly floated by LVMH earlier this month and “$15 higher than the original all-cash offer delivered to Tiffany by LVMH managing director Antonio Belloni on October 18,” per Reuters. “It represents a 7.5 percent premium over Tiffany’s closing share price on Friday and is more than 50 percent higher than where the price stood before LVMH launched its effort to woo the company.”

In what is the biggest – and most expensive – deal of LVMH’s to date, including the $13 billion that LVMH paid in April 2017 to formally bring the long-affiliated but technically separate Christian Dior brand under its ownership umbrella, Tiffany & Co.’s offerings will bolster LVMH’s smallest division: jewelry. Despite owning a sweeping array of luxury-centric brands, LVMH is relatively light when it comes to “hard luxury.” Its Watches & Jewelry division consists of Bvlgari Chaumet, FRED, Hublot, TAG Heuer, Zenith, and 99-year old Italian jewelry brand Repossi, upping its stake latter this year from 42 percent to 69 percent.

Not only will the Tiffany & Co. acquisition enable LVMH to make greater inroads into the $20 billion global jewelry market, which was “one of the strongest performing areas of the luxury industry in 2018,” according to consultancy Bain & Co, and “increase LVMH’s exposure to the bridal and diamond category, as well as to U.S. luxury shoppers,” according to Reuters, it will serve as part of what the Guardian characterizes as “the latest in a wave of consolidations in the luxury goods industry that is tilting towards the ‘Fuerdai’ – a new generation of wealthy Chinese consumers.”

Sources for CNBC reveal that while Tiffany & Co. “has been building up its e-commerce business, and is trying to court younger shoppers with more affordable pendants and earrings and new designs, LVMH believes Tiffany needs to spend more on reinventing and marketing its brands, and that it can achieve this only as a division of LVMH.”

“We are delighted to have the opportunity to welcome Tiffany, a company with an unparalleled heritage and unique position in the global jewelry world, to the LVMH family,” LVMH chairman and CEO Arnault, said in a statement on Monday.

According to the New York Times, the deal, which still requires the approval of Tiffany’s shareholders, is expected to close in the middle of next year."
LVMH Acquires Tiffany & Co. For $16.2 Billion - aBlogtoWatch,"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFibG9ndG93YXRjaC5jb20vbHZtaC1hY3F1aXJlcy10aWZmYW55LWNvLWZvci0xNi0yLWJpbGxpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The world’s largest luxury goods group just got larger, as LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE announced early on November 25 that it will acquire luxury jewelry giant Tiffany & Co. in a transaction totaling $16.2 billion in stock buyouts. The deal is expected to close in mid-2020 and has the potential to radically reshape the currently luxury watch retail landscape.

When asked for comment, LVMH Chairman and CEO Bernard Arnault stated, “We are delighted to have the opportunity to welcome Tiffany, a company with an unparalleled heritage and unique position in the global jewelry world, to the LVMH family. We have an immense respect and admiration for Tiffany and intend to develop this jewel with the same dedication and commitment that we have applied to each and every one of our Maisons. We will be proud to have Tiffany sit alongside our iconic brands and look forward to ensuring that Tiffany continues to thrive for centuries to come.” It is difficult to say for certain what all this could mean for the watch industry moving forward.

Advertising Message

Although only part of the group’s vast portfolio of luxury brand’s LVMH’s watch division encompasses a wide variety of high-profile nameplates including TAG Heuer, Zenith, Bulgari, Hublot, Chaumet, and Dior Watches. To this will be added Tiffany & Co.’s own line of in-house timepieces, including standouts such as the CT60 Chronograph and the East West collection. Beyond this, there are no details yet on what this will mean for watch sales at Tiffany & Co.’s massive retailer network and how it may or may not change up the lineup of watchmakers available at Tiffany & Co. outlets.

Of particular interest to collectors as well is the question this raises about the future of the legendary series of Tiffany & Co. signed dials on watches. While the Tiffany & Co. signature has historically graced the dials of iconic pieces from Patek Philippe, Rolex, and more over the years (oftentimes dramatically increasing sale values at auction), the news of this corporate acquisition leaves the door wide open to the possibility of Tiffany & Co. signed TAG Heuer, Zenith, Bulgari or Hublot timepieces in the future although nothing has of yet been announced. The other major question is how this merger will affect the long standing relationship between Tiffany & Co. and Patek Philippe, which has been continuously maintained all the way back to 1876.

Whatever the future may hold, it’s clear that this merger is a further example of the growing centralization of the watch industry, with nearly all major Swiss brands now sitting under the umbrella of a few major holding companies."
LVMH Acquires Tiffany for $16.2 Billion - WWD,"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtc2VhbHMtdGlmZmFueS1kZWFsLWZvci0xNi0yLWJpbGxpb24tMTIwMzM3NzUxNi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton on Monday struck an agreement to buy Tiffany & Co. for $16.2 billion, securing a future for the storied American jeweler among leaders of the sector while consolidating its own position as the dominant force in global luxury.

LVMH’s largest transaction ever, the deal remakes a lucrative segment of the high-end market — jewelry is up there with shoes and handbags as a leading area of growth — placing the French group on firm footing to compete with rival Compagnie Financière Richemont, the owner of Cartier, by doubling the size of its watches and jewelry division.

It will also gain a stronghold in the U.S., bulking up the group’s revenue stream from the region, a key strategic area for LVMH.

A household name, Tiffany carries New York and Old Hollywood flavors of chic while channeling the aspirational optimism of American culture — as famously relayed by Audrey Hepburn’s character in the Sixties movie “Breakfast at Tiffany’s.” The 182-year-old house, seen as the only true American luxury brand, has also gained popularity with Asia’s younger generations in recent years — a strength LVMH executives are seizing on as a promise of future growth.

“Given the importance of Chinese customers, we will obviously be very dedicated to understanding this much better to see how we can support their development with even stronger innovation and means, so that we can accelerate development in a market that — in today’s luxury world — you can’t do without,” said LMVH managing director Antonio Belloni, who spoke to WWD.

It’s increasingly a case of survival of the fittest in luxury — a sector dominated by European houses — with the rise of digital commerce calling for steep investments in infrastructure and technology. Add to that, the need to invest in retail networks in Mainland China, as government policies encourage consumers there to spend more at home.

LVMH pledged to invest in its new acquisition, which remains subject to approval by Tiffany shareholders and regulators, and is expected to close in the middle of next year.

“We have immense respect and admiration for Tiffany and intend to develop this jewel with the same dedication and commitment that we have applied to each and every one of our maisons,” said LVMH chairman and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault, Europe’s wealthiest person, in a statement.

“As part of the LVMH group, Tiffany will reach new heights,” predicted Alessandro Bogliolo, ceo of Tiffany, who in the past was ceo of Bulgari when it was bought by the French luxury group.

Executives from the French group outlined plans Monday to draw on the house’s jewelry collections to build specific product pillars, as well as focus on Asian consumers — traveling or in their home markets — saying they saw greater potential for the publicly listed jewelry house to develop outside the scrutiny of financial markets, when it enters the LVMH fold.

“We believe the company…has a very sound and logical strategy — the only issue it has is that implementing a long-term strategy of increasing the value of the brand when you have to do quarterly reporting is not that simple, and the pressure is enormous to obtain short-term results,” said LVMH chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony, speaking in a conference call with analysts.

The executive said the brand was “a little bit underrepresented” in Asia, where it could be stronger with locals, as well as with travelers to Europe, particularly Asians.

Drawing on experience from its star jewelry label Bulgari, which LVMH bought in 2011 for $5.2 billion, the company plans to organize the business around specific product pillars, a common practice in the industry.

While the two brands appeal to different customers and are different stylistically — Bulgari is known for gold and colored gems, while Tiffany is more associated with platinum, silver and diamonds — some strategies can be repeated, suggested Belloni.

“If you look at Cartier, Bulgari, you have a number of product pillars, whether Serpenti, B.zero1, Diva, when you put them together, they really account for the larger part of the offer — so they have meaning that is additional to the fact that somebody likes the brand,” said Belloni, referring to the Italian jeweler’s snake-like watch bands, its modern colosseum-inspired rings and collections built around colorful fan-shaped forms meant to evoke the Caracalla baths of Ancient Rome.

For potential product pillars at Tiffany, executives listed ideas like the house’s modern T-collection, built around the letter T, as well as its diamond setting that dates back to 1886.

“We’ll have to be select and see which ones we’ll drive forward…it’s important to stay focused,” said Belloni.

“It’s capitalizing on existing lines but also developing new ones,” Guiony said, hinting at the idea of adding two or three new pillars in the future.

LVMH also boosted productivity of individual stores at Bulgari, which it plans to do at Tiffany, executives said.

“One other item that was so important at Bulgari was boosting the productivity of individual stores, and I think that remains an opportunity at Tiffany particularly in some parts of the world where they may have some stores that will need to be sized a little better or real estate that may need to be a little bit more focused,” said Belloni.

Tiffany counts 321 stores in more than 20 countries, mostly in the Americas and Asia.

“The strength of the LVMH group at picking up the best retail spots and ability to move brands in various locations, enables us to occupy the top place,” said Guiony.

Faced with the challenges of the digital era, retailers are drawing up even more spectacular flagships, which have become central to standing out in a crowded field and for relaying the essence of a brand — Tiffany, the famed Fifth Avenue flagship in New York, which is undergoing an overhaul led by Reed Krakoff, will remain a focus.

“This is a very iconic store that has been there for many years and will be there for many more years — and that will continue to be a point of strength,” said Belloni.

When it comes to price points, Tiffany makes high jewelry in the exclusive ranges but is also known for offering accessibly priced pieces. Its European web site lists a section for jewelry under 500 euros, for example, and LVMH executives said they were happy with the house’s breadth.

“All luxury brands have an entry-priced business; the question is not the price but whether they carry the value of the brand,” said Guiony, who suggested LVMH is open to exploring new categories of accessories, like scarves, perhaps, given Bulgari’s success with non-jewelry items.

“Some brands like Dior and Chanel, while they can touch the peaks of the high end…they also have lipsticks but in a very different price segment, and they represent access to the brand, with the creative integrity of the brand,” said Belloni.

Executives listed the company’s supply chain — Tiffany has been bringing its supply chain for diamonds and other materials in-house for the past two decades — and Internet commerce as areas where the French group could learn a thing or two.

“Tiffany is definitely in advance due to its high level of vertical integration,’’ said Guiony. While there are not plans in the near future to change its sourcing strategy for LVMH jewelry houses — which, in addition to Bulgari include Chaumet and Fred — it eventually “could help our brands,” added Guiony.

As for e-commerce, the executive said “what they’ve done on e-commerce is impressive,” noting lessons could be applied to other jewelry houses in the group.

LVMH initially bid $120 per share for the jeweler in October, kicking off weeks of haggling before the parties settled on $135.

The sweetened offer will call for “a bit more work” from LVMH and “a bit more time” to generate a return on the price paid, said Rogerio Fujimori, analyst with RBC, citing higher multiples than those of the original offering price. LVMH said the deal has a total enterprise value of $16.9 billion, which comes to 16.6 times 2018 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.

“We believe that LVMH can still generate long-term value from this strategic deal if it manages to reinvigorate Tiffany’s top-line story and improve Tiffany’s profitability in the long term,” the analyst said in a research note to clients.

Drawing parallels with the luxury group’s Bulgari acquisition, the analyst predicted that Tiffany would require stronger initial investments to boost sales growth.

“We believe that Tiffany will probably require stronger initial reinvestment (we think) to reignite top-line growth but should immediately benefit from back-office and distribution synergies as part of LVMH as well as the ability to explore faster opportunities created by digital,” the analyst added.

LVMH estimated net income accretion at around 5 percent of full-year 2020 estimates, starting midyear.

LVMH was advised by Citi and J.P. Morgan, with legal counsel from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP. Tiffany’s financial advisers were Centerview Partners LLC and Goldman Sachs, while Sullivan & Cromwell LLP acted as legal counsel for the American jeweler.

Asked if LVMH plans to take a pause from acquisitions or if it is setting a new pace — the Tiffany deal follows the purchase earlier this year of luxury travel group Belmond for $2.6 billion — Belloni chuckled and said the company has a full plate.

“We had better put this money to work, so I think our focus will be on learning about these businesses, putting the foundations and putting them on a trajectory where we can really extract their proper value,” he said.

“For quite a while we’ll be focused on developing and maximizing the beauty of these brands before we take on something else of size,” added Belloni."
LVMH Unveils Details of La Samaritaine Complex - WWD,"Tue, 19 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtbGEtc2FtYXJpdGFpbmUtY29tcGxleC0xMjAzMzc0MzYwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — The French capital is famous for its monuments and monumental projects, but here’s a new one for the register: La Samaritaine.

Built in the early 20th century and shuttered in 2005, the fabled, Right Bank department store, which belongs to LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, has undergone extensive renovations and is reemerging as a mixed-use site with an emphasis on French luxury. And now it has an opening date: April 2020.

At long last, said LVMH executives who outlined plans for the 750-million-euro refurbishment on Tuesday.

“Welcome to La Samaritaine — honestly, there were times when I wondered if I would be able to say those words one day,” said LVMH’s chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Guiony, who managed the project.

He spoke to journalists on the top floor of one of the main buildings, where a gold-hued peacock mural presided over elaborate Art Nouveau iron-work running down five flights of stairs, lacquered in gray paint.

The group snatched up a majority stake of the department store in 2001, winning control over prime real estate — smack dab in the center of Paris, its complex of buildings sitting next to the River Seine, overlooking the historic Conciergerie prison.

Fifteen years after the group closed La Samaritaine, citing safety reasons, it will reemerge as a showcase of LVMH businesses. The group’s Cheval Blanc hotel will reside in the riverfront property, becoming the first urban location for the exclusive chain known for resort locations like Courchevel and St. Barths. There will also be offices, low-income housing, a day-care center, restaurants and the namesake department store, which will be refashioned as a sprawling concept-store with a focus on French labels and a floor dedicated to beauty products.

Around 2,400 people will work on the site, including in offices — likely housing LVMH businesses, according to Guiony.

Politically-charged from the outset — the store’s closure angered employees and longtime patrons — the project encountered resistance from local authorities at various stages and plans for a modern, wavy glass exterior sparked lengthy debates about how much change should be allowed in the city’s historic center.

It also harbored technical challenges, according to executives, who said security concerns kept them from rebuilding floors of sales space, and that there were often tensions between interest in historical preservation and safety concerns.

“The idea of a mixed-use project was born first of all from a constraint. The former Samaritaine with selling space that stretched from the basement to the top floor — that was impossible for technical reasons, for security reasons. We had to do things differently,” said Guiony.

The mixed-use bent reflects a more contemporary approach to retail, with mall operators like Westfield focusing on development sites that tap into flows of urban foot traffic and blend retail space with offices or cultural sites. Local rival Galeries Lafayette recently reconfigured a section of the Marais district near its BHV Paris department store, with a series of pedestrian passageways and courtyards opening on to stores and Eataly restaurants and leading to the group’s art foundation.

The revival of the Samaritaine complex, which serves as a link between the Left Bank of Paris and the recently refurbished shopping center Les Halles, comes amid a period of urban renewal in the center of Paris, with projects including the Pinault family’s contemporary art collection, which will be housed in the Bourse de Commerce de Paris, a renovation overseen by Japanese architect Tadao Ando.

Surrounding the complex, the Rue de la Monnaie will be closed to motorized traffic, and the Rue du Pont Neuf will be partially closed to traffic.

With interiors designed by Peter Marino, who sought to channel the style of a Parisian apartment, the Cheval Blanc hotel will have restaurants, a rooftop garden, a pool lined with mosaics, a carousel for children, a hair salon, 26 rooms and 46 suites — with prices upward of 1,150 euros a night — including an apartment stretching more than 10,000 square feet. Chef Arnaud Donckele will manage a restaurant on the first floor, and two others will sit on the seventh floor, with an outdoor terrace.

A French style of hosting would serve to differentiate the hotel from its Asian and Anglo-Saxon counterparts that dominate the high end hotel market, noted Olivier Lefebvre, director of LVMH’s hotel activities. The executive described the approach as “ultra-personalized, warm and convivial.”

The chain has four resort hotels and plans for new locations in London and Los Angeles.

“Cheval Blanc Paris is in a Parisian neighborhood, in the heart of historical Paris, cultural Paris, and also contemporary Paris — steps away from everything — Saint Germain, the Place des Vosges, the Louvre — it’s a neighborhood that we believe in,” said Lefebvre.

Renamed La Samaritaine Pont Neuf, the department store will cover 215,000 square feet of space refurbished by Yabu Pushelberg, a New York and Toronto-based design studio, and will be operated by DFS, LVMH’s travel retail business.

“We have a very competitive environment in Paris, so it’s of the utmost importance that we differentiate ourselves,” said Eléonore de Boysson, who heads DFS operations in Europe and the Middle East.

DFS was a logical choice to run the department store given its experience with Asian clients, noted de Boysson, who said she expects the clientele to be a mix of French and international customers, with international visitors accounting for the majority of sales. She added the retailer seeks to offer an experience that she described as “typically French, unforgettable and authentic.”

A criss-crossing elevator bank on the ground floor recalls other department stores, including the group’s Left Bank institution, Le Bon Marché, but the space is lit with natural light, with a soaring glass ceiling that adds height to the building.

Executives stressed the juxtaposition of historical and modern elements. Colorful Art Deco tiles on one facade contrast with the wave-like glass facade designed by Japanese architect firm Sanaa, which has designed Christian Dior’s Ginza store, for example.

Guiony was asked if there would be a sales point for Tiffany & Co. — LVMH last month offered to buy the American jeweler for $120 a share.

We’ll see, was his answer."

LVMH chief Bernard Arnault told Donald Trump a deal was in the works before he finalized the $16.2 billion takeover of Tiffany & Co, according to the Financial Times.

""I told the president I would buy something significant in the US, but I didn't tell him the name,"" the French luxury titan's chairman and CEO told the newspaper.

Arnault, the world's third-richest person with a net worth north of $100 billion, also called Trump last Sunday to discuss the two companies' agreed $16.2 billion deal, the Financial Times reported.

He may have given Trump a heads up in a bid to stay in his good books, given the president's past hostility towards foreign takeovers of American companies and pressuring of competition regulators to nix or approve deals.

For example, Trump blocked a Chinese-backed group from buying US-based Lattice Semiconductor in September 2017, and barred Broadcom — which was bought by a Singaporean company in 2016 — from acquiring US-based Qualcomm in March 2018.

Similarly, after United Technologies and Raytheon agreed to merge this summer, Trump voiced concerns that the deal would lessen competition for government contracts. In July 2018, he tweeted that it was ""so sad and unfair"" that the Federal Communications Commission didn't approve the merger between Sinclair Broadcast Group and Tribune Media.

Moreover, his administration passed a law in the fall of 2018 that expanded the range of deals that could be reviewed due to national security concerns."
This map shows how Tiffany extends LVMH’s luxury retail empire - The Business of Business,"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZidXNpbmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvbHZtaC10by1hZGQtdGlmZmFueS1hcy1jcm93bi1qZXdlbC1vZi1pdHMtcmV0YWlsLWVtcGlyZS_SAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc29mYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2FtcC9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdm1oLXRvLWFkZC10aWZmYW55LWFzLWNyb3duLWpld2VsLW9mLWl0cy1yZXRhaWwtZW1waXJlLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Global luxury retailer LVMH ($EPA:MC) plans to buy US jeweler Tiffany in a $16.2 billion deal that will further develop its position in the high-end fashion space. Tiffany ($TIF) shares shot up 6% in pre-market trading Monday morning November 25, on news of the deal.

Our first map tracks all locations that would be part of the LVMH-Tiffany empire globally - you can zoom in down to individual intersections to see Tiffany's locations and how close they are to LVMH stores.

Tiffany is like many other leading US retailers - because much of its inventory tends to move around the holiday (or, engagement) season, which is reflected in the chart above. Tiffany added 85% to job postings from 2019 lows, although this year's hiring peak doesn't match that of 2018. The Tiffany store count (not shown) has been steady for years, so the relative lack of growth in job posts is less concerning with additional data.

The deal helps position LVMH in front of a valuable new segment of the luxury marketplace and to add a still-growing brand to a stable of products that could use a jolt. LVMH brand Sephora is losing ground to competing brands like Ulta ($ULTA), as the makeup space is rapidly diversifying and as social media disruptors are smashing down barriers to entry that for generations preserved the positions of legacy players in the space.

Sephora has, according to Thinknum Alternative Data, 665 locations as part of a partnership with JC Penney ($JCP), but that also amounts to roughly three-quarters of the beleaguered retailer's US locations.

But the Tiffany deal adds to LVMH portfolio a potent complement to other jewelry brands like TAG Heuer, Hublot and Bulgari - and billions in additional revenue, as well.

And, we've also got a gif of the future LVMH-Tiffany footprint, which feels appropriate with the holiday season about to start.

Alexander Wang Is Skipping His Next Show for Something Bigger (Vogue)

Alexander Wang has been showing off-schedule (in December and June rather than September and February) since 2017. But this year the designer will not hold a show next month. It’s all good, he just wants to hold out for something bigger: his 15th anniversary in 2020. “A show in December felt like it maybe wasn’t the best place to put our focus,” he said. “I don’t want to say that this is a decision that means we won’t return to a fashion show again, or that we don’t believe in the format, but it just felt like the right moment for us to do something different.” So far Wang is tight-lipped on the details, but there will be a “consumer-facing moment” or event next spring.

Edie Campbell Was Told She Was “Too Fat” To Open Milan Fashion Week (The Guardian)

“I was absolutely fuming to be told by a brand that I was ‘too fat’ to open this year’s Milan Fashion Week,” British model Edie Campbell recently told The Guardian. While she would not name which brand made the comments, she claims she found out after remarks were made to her agents. “[My agent] had to call and tell me that ‘It had been a little bit difficult in the fitting’ and ‘You’re a little bit bigger than you were last year.’ I was incensed that I had to find out that way.”

Luxury player: why Bernard Arnault is making a blockbuster bid for Tiffany’s - The Guardian,"Sat, 02 Nov 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDE5L25vdi8wMi9iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtbHV4dXJ5LXBsYXllci1ibG9ja2J1c3Rlci1iaWQtdGlmZmFueXPSAWdodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAxOS9ub3YvMDIvYmVybmFyZC1hcm5hdWx0LWx1eHVyeS1wbGF5ZXItYmxvY2tidXN0ZXItYmlkLXRpZmZhbnlz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French billionaire businessman Bernard Arnault has been called many things: the Wolf in Cashmere, the Exterminating Angel, Tintin – for his neat, boyish looks – and Lord of the Logos among them. But it is perhaps a building that portrays him better than nicknames.

In the woodland of Paris’s Bois de Boulogne, the Louis Vuitton Foundation rises like a displaced iceberg in a pool of meltwater: the £80m structure, designed by American architect Frank Gehry, is creative, complex and visionary, but not entirely admired or popular. Imposing and inspired, it is also sharp and cool, as in chilly rather than trendy.

The same could be said of Arnault, 70, a trim, cultured and slightly awkward man who started his life as the son of an industrialist in Roubaix, a poor town in France’s post-industrial rust belt. He rose through hard work and a certain creativity to become the undisputed master of the luxury goods universe as president of LVMH, the €196bn (£169bn) group whose name is an abbreviation of its cornerstone brands: Louis Vuitton, the world’s biggest luxury house, and Moët Hennessy, the champagne and cognac producer. He is the world’s third-richest man, with a fortune worth $97bn (£75bn).

Last week LVMH said it was looking to add US jeweller Tiffany & Co to its stable with a $14.5bn bid. Tiffany said it was reviewing the proposal, which has been driven by Arnault’s desire to bolster LVMH’s presence in the “hard luxury” – or jewellery and watches – market, where it owns Bulgari but still trails Swiss rival Richemont.

It would be the most valuable deal of a career that always seemed destined for the top. After graduating from the elite engineering school École Polytechnique, whose alumni include three Nobel prize winners and three former presidents, Arnault spent a short time working for his father’s construction business before convincing Arnault senior to ditch the building side and concentrate on real estate. In 1984, he acquired Boussac Saint-Frères, a failing textile company hiding a gem – the Christian Dior brand.

After a spell in the US, Arnault returned to France determined to take on the country’s traditional corporate leaders – the aristocrats, major wine chateaux and family dynasties – with an aggressive American-style approach to business.

In 1989 he made a hostile takeover of LVMH and it became a launchpad for the acquisitions of some of the world’s most prestigious labels. Today, LVMH is made up of more than 70 companies, including haute couture labels Dior and Fendi, watchmakers Tag Heuer and Hublot, upmarket jeweller Bulgari, and the Veuve Clicquot and Dom Pérignon champagne houses. It made a profit of €10bn on €46.8bn of sales in 2018.

Lloyd Blankfein, the former chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, says Arnault’s skill was in realising the global demand for luxury products. “He was a complete visionary. He saw the increase of wealth in the world,” Blankfein said last year.

Pierre Mallevays, former head of acquisitions at LVMH, who now runs the boutique financial advisory firm Savigny Partners, said: “Arnault is a man of great vision. He did not invent luxury brands but he invented the luxury industry. He singlehandedly helped transform a landscape which was a collection of family-run businesses into organised, professionally run groups with synergies and benefits of scale. He anticipated that more and more people would want to buy luxury products and organised himself to ride that growth.”

In business, Arnault is considered ferocious and predatory. At home he is by all accounts an attentive father and family man. He is a trained and reportedly talented pianist and a keen tennis player. He is proud of having once played Roger Federer – a birthday gift from his children – against whom he scored a single point.

He has five children. He had two with his first wife Anne Dewavrin: daughter Delphine, who is being groomed to take over the LVMH empire, and Antoine, head of communications for the luxury group. He has three sons with his second wife, the French Canadian concert pianist Hélène Mercier. The couple live in an upmarket district of Paris’s Left Bank, where Arnault’s art collection includes works by Damien Hirst, Pablo Picasso, Henry Moore and Andy Warhol. He also owns a large villa in St Tropez.

Arnault is often described as a man more interested in culture and creativity than cash. He insists his reputation as an asset-stripping cold fish is undeserved. “It’s true that I am not from the south and I have a certain reserve,” he once said. “I take time to get close to, and I don’t immediately throw my arms round someone. But it is more a question of style.”

Running LVMH is a balancing act in which Arnault gives his star designers – who have included fashion bad-boy John Galliano and Alexander McQueen – funding and a free creative rein, while expecting results in the long term. “What I always say to my team is: I am not that much interested in the numbers for the next six months. What I am interested in is that the desire for the brand will be the same in 10 years as it is today,” he said last year.

However, colleagues and business associates, who rarely go on the record, describe him as impatient and unbending, ruthless and driven in only one direction: forward. His failures are rare but have included an unsuccessful bid for control of Gucci, now owned by France’s third-richest person, François Pinault, chief executive and founder of the French luxury group Kering. (The pair’s notorious rivalry hit the headlines after the Notre Dame cathedral fire, when Pinault’s pledge of €100m to help rebuild the cathedral was trumped by a promise of €200m from Arnault.) He was also thwarted when he went after Hermès five years ago, but the consolation prize was a huge profit on the shareholding LVMH had amassed.

Arnault is longstanding friends with the former centre-right president of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, and is also close to France’s current centrist president, Emmanuel Macron, and his wife Brigitte, a former schoolteacher who once taught two of Arnault’s children at a private school in Paris. However, when the Socialist party’s François Hollande was elected in 2012 with a promise to hit the rich with a 75% tax rate, Arnault caused public outrage by applying for Belgian nationality. The tycoon quickly dropped the application, insisting he had always intended to keep paying his taxes in France.

He has said it is novelty rather than money that drives him in business. “Profit is a consequence of what we do well; it should never become a goal,” he told the Financial Times this year.

He is, however, rich and getting richer. Arnault jumped to second place on Bloomberg’s wealth league in July, overtaking Microsoft’s Bill Gates to rank behind Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, but dropped back to third shortly afterwards. His Tiffany bid could see him make another tilt for the top: “I always liked being number one,” he said in the Financial Times interview.

The late Steve Jobs could not see Arnault losing his fortune any time soon. “I don’t know if in 50 years my iPhone will still be a success, but I can tell you I’m sure everybody will still drink your Dom Pérignon,” the Apple founder once told him.

French luxury group LVMH to buy Tiffany for $16.2 billion - Utica Observer Dispatch,"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnV0aWNhb2QuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAxOS8xMS8yNS9mcmVuY2gtbHV4dXJ5LWdyb3VwLWx2bWgtdG8vMjIxOTExMTAwNy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French luxury group LVMH to buy Tiffany for $16.2 billion

PARIS — French luxury group LVMH has agreed to buy iconic New York jeweler Tiffany & Co. for $16.2 billion, adding a famed star to its portfolio that already boasts Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Bulgari.

LVMH said in a statement Monday it will take over the 182-year old Tiffany and its 300 boutiques worldwide at $135 a share. The price tag is higher than the $14.5 billion cash offer LVMH made last month.

Tiffany, known for its delicate jewelry, distinctive blue boxes and an Audrey Hepburn movie, says the deal will ensure its long-term sustainability. The company is trying to transform its brand to appeal to younger and more digital shoppers, and could use an owner with deep pockets to help expand its business.

Shares in Tiffany rose almost 6% in premarket trading in New York, while LVMH was up 2% in Paris.

LVMH, led by billionaire Bernard Arnault, says the deal will strengthen its position in high-end jewelry and in the U.S. market. The purchase gives the French conglomerate a new star in its already distinctive portfolio - one that will help it compete with Gucci-owner Kering Group and Cartier-owner Richemont SA.

LVMH already owns 75 brands including Christian Dior, Fendi, and Givenchy as well as watchmaker Tag Heuer. Its flagship brand Louis Vuitton recently opened a handbag workshop in Texas, with President Donald Trump in attendance.

LVMH said both companies' boards approved the deal and hope to finalize the takeover in 2020, subject to the approval of regulators and Tiffany shareholders.

The offer comes as luxury goods companies have been wrestling with changing habits of shoppers who are increasingly buying online. They're also purchasing second-hand luxury items from places like The RealReal.com.

In addition, luxury companies are facing fears of an economic slowdown in China, a key area of business, while they're already dealing with a slowdown in international tourism in the U.S.

Under its CEO, Alessandro Bogliolo, Tiffany is trying to appeal to younger shoppers with more modern takes on jewelry. Earlier this year, it launched a men's jewelry collection, and it's increasing its marketing to a more diverse customer base like same-sex couples. It's also been renovating its flagship store in Manhattan.

Still, Tiffany's U.S. sales have been stagnating as China's slowing economy has weighed on spending by Chinese tourists, who make up a substantial portion of luxury spending. The strong dollar has also made Tiffany products more expensive for consumers outside the U.S.

Tiffany has been putting plans in place to appeal to a younger group of customers who are more used to shopping online and hunting for fashion deals. Tiffany has notably highlighted ways customers can personalize jewelry and started letting people trace the origin of their diamonds.

Tiffany had sales of $4.4 billion in 2018, an increase of nearly 7% over 2017. LVMH reported 6.3 billion euros in profits in 2018 on 46.8 billion euros in sales."

LVMH is the world’s biggest luxury group, home to 75 different brands including Christian Dior, Bulgari, Louis Vuitton, Celine and Givenchy.

The deal will bolster LVMH's jewelry and watch lineup and boost the French company's presence in the United States, which accounts for about a quarter of its revenue.

The acquisition is one of the largest in the career od LVMH chief executive officer Bernard Arnault, Europe’s richest man, and in the history of the luxury sector.

According to LVMH, the transaction will likely not be finalized until mid-2020, though it has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies."

With its acquisition of Tiffany & Co., looks to have executed a master stroke. The world number one in luxury forked out $16.2 billion to snap up the brand, which is a major player on the U.S. luxury market, but also, and above all, an iconic jewelry label. The deal is the biggest in the French group's history, making it an unprecedented operation, the strong promise of which was already acknowledged by the markets on Monday.







LVMH has bought a rich history of 180 years of heritage - Tiffany.com



As one of the last large independent companies with no reference shareholders, Tiffany & Co. was the ideal prey for LVMH. The acquisition was made even more attractive by the fact that, following a difficult spell, the brand, which has been busy turning itself around since 2017, now has strong growth potential. In other words, it was an operation with limited risks for LVMH, and one which looks set to bring the company a wide range of advantages. Nonetheless, one might be forgiven for thinking that the price paid was a little high, not least because it's equivalent to 16.6 times the jeweler's EBITDA, according to information published by the luxury group, which valued the company at $16.9 billion.



""Not counting watches, Tiffany & Co. is still the top jeweler in the world,"" explained an industry expert. In the fiscal year ended 31 January 2019, the company achieved $4.44 billion in revenues, up 7% compared to the previous year, while its net earnings were $586.4 million, corresponding to 13.2% of total sales. The brand's operating income came to $790 million, with its EBITDA totaling $1.02 billion, their respective margins being 17.8% and 22.9%.

With the color of its famous blue box having entered common parlance as ""Tiffany blue,"" the jewelry brand, which employs some 14,200 people, gives LVMH the chance to work with a historied luxury house boasting a rich heritage and a strong public image perfected over almost two centuries – just the kind of label the French conglomerate thrives on. Tiffany & Co. was founded with the opening of its first store in central Manhattan by Charles Lewis Tiffany in 1837, the same year as French luxury house , another brand that has attracted LVMH's attention in the past.



""Tiffany & Co.'s structure is healthy, presenting an entirely vertical process from design to production. The company is very advanced for the sector. Since 1982, it has complete control over its supply chain and sources all of its diamonds, in particular the rough diamonds that it cuts itself. The process is completely regulated. In this respect, the company is irreproachable. It is also miles ahead with its approach to customers,"" continued the expert.



This is an undeniable bonus at a time when sustainable development has become an unavoidable question for the luxury industry, a fact highlighted by LVMH CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony. ""We want to capitalize on the company's entirely vertical production structure and establish some synergies at the group level. For example, we could benefit from its diamond sourcing, but it's too early to talk about that now,"" he commented.







The different segments of Tiffany & Co.'s multi-category offering - LVMH



Another interesting factor is the enormous development seen in the jeweler's global expansion, a feat achieved almost entirely through the retail channel, apart from in Asia, where the brand's products are also distributed via wholesale. Of its 321 stores, which are spread over 20 countries and are often set up at prestigious addresses, 124 are in the U.S. The company is also well established in Asia, where it has 90 stores to its name, boasting a particularly strong presence in China. On top of this, this figure doesn't even include the Japanese market, whose results the company presents separately, and which alone has 55 Tiffany stores. Along with its physical locations, the company also operates an e-commerce platform, which represents around 7% of its total sales.



""LVMH's business model for its brands is already developed around distribution through company-owned boutiques. With Tiffany, the French group will be able to continue strengthening its own distribution network and boost its negotiating power,"" noted jewelry designer Loretta Baiocchi, who has worked with some of the biggest jewelry and luxury labels.





Could Tiffany follow in the footsteps of ?





""The brand looks as though it could be set up for easier expansion in oriental markets. In terms of its offering, the company is very interesting because it covers all of the segments. Notably, it's particularly strong with low-end products. The Tiffany model is already well defined. With its brute force, LVMH will be able to extend this concept, which is already ready to some extent,"" she observed.



""Tiffany & Co. is a universal label, which can be adapted to any price. Its product range is as relevant for its low-end products as it is for its fine jewelry. It could become the Louis Vuitton of jewelry,"" added an analyst.



The jeweler did go through a difficult period after 2015, changing CEO twice in the space of four years and suffering from a certain strategic inconsistency. However, having reported declining sales and lost market share between 2015 and 2017, the company began to recover lost terrain under the direction of its new CEO, , who arrived with a fresh creative director, , and managed to breathe new life into Tiffany & Co.



""The brand has always maintained a very high value, which has never been put into question, not even when the company was losing significant sales volumes and market share in the U.S.,"" said the analyst, explaining that, in his opinion, LVMH has acquired ""a little-exploited brand with enormous growth potential.""



With its solid financial structure, the group led by would seem to be one of the best placed companies to take on the challenge, not least because the French colossus is known for its skill in driving profits with its investments, as can be seen in the rise of , which has doubled its revenues since being purchased by LVMH in 2011.







The Tiffany boutique in Sydney, en Australie - Tiffany.com



With Tiffany, the luxury giant will strengthen its presence in the jewelry segment, a task for which it will be able to rely on the expertise of the American brand. Furthermore, according to LVMH's estimates, the group's ""Watches and Jewelry"" division, which currently represents only 9% of its total sales, will grow to account for 16% of revenues, contributing 13% of the company's operating income, compared to its current contribution of 7%.



During a conference call with analysts, the group's executives highlighted that the acquisition would serve to ""further balance the LVMH portfolio, both in terms of products and regions,"" while also being ""a perfect complement"" to its existing brands, that is ""ideally aligned with the group's objective to bring together tradition and modernity.""



""We have great respect for Tiffany & Co., its management and its strategy, and we have no intention of turning everything upside down,"" said Guiony, who went on to explain that the best way to ""do better"" was to support the company in its efforts to execute its strategy. There is therefore no ""specific priority,"" the group's objective being to drive progress in all aspects of the brand, in ""its product, distribution network and branding.""



Nonetheless, a particular focus will be engagement rings, one of strengths. The fact that the American brand is also known for its low-end silver products is no problem for its new owner, as the line is an important part of the American jeweler's brand image. ""In line with what we learned through our experience with Bulgari, we are going to emphasize the development of the brand's collections, because the collection is the heart of the business,"" added the CFO.



Tiffany's distribution in Europe, which is still relatively modest, accounting for only 11% of the jeweler's total sales – compared to 44% in the U.S., 28% in Asia-Pacific and 15% in Japan – will certainly be developed, especially among local consumers and in the travel retail channel.



When asked if he considered Tiffany & Co. to be more of a New York brand than an American one, Guiony replied, ""Neither an American, nor a New York brand. It's a real luxury brand, with an American heritage that makes it unique."" And so begins the Tiffany's integration into the world of LVMH."

The acquisition brings the American jeweler under LVMH’s umbrella, adding to stable of high-powered brands that already includes Bulgari, TAG Heuer and Hublot.



LVMH expects the addition of Tiffany to strengthen its position in the jewelry market and bolster its presence in the United States, the company said in a press release about the acquisition.



Rumors of a potential deal began rumbling last month, prompting Tiffany to confirm it had received an unsolicited bid for $120 per share, valuing the company at $14.5 billion.



Tiffany reportedly entered preliminary discussions with LVMH and asked the company to up the bid, which it raised to $130 per share.



The final deal was for $135 per share, or $16.2 billion, one of the largest transactions in LVMH’s history.



Founded in 1837 by Charles Lewis Tiffany, the first Tiffany store opened in downtown Manhattan. The luxury brand slowly built an empire, expanding to more than 300 stores across the globe.



LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault described the retailer as having “an unparalleled heritage and unique position in the global jewelry world.”



Flavio Cereda, an equity analyst at Jeffries, stated in a note prior to the deal announcement that Tiffany’s “brand equity and the strength of the image of its iconic 1837 Blue Box are more valuable than the current financials suggest.”



Cereda said LVMH can leverage these to target the Asian millennial market, which would mean a “rethinking of the current product mix and its U.S. footprint, in our view.”



Tiffany CEO Alessandro Bogliolo noted the company has been striving for “sustainable, long-term growth” and said the acquisition will “provide further support, resources and momentum for those priorities as we evolve toward becoming the next generation luxury jeweler.”



The boards of directors of both companies have approved the transaction. Tiffany’s board recommended its shareholders give it the green light as well.



The deal is expected to close mid-2020 and is subject to approval from Tiffany’s shareholders, regulatory approval, and other customary closing conditions.



Citi and J.P. Morgan serve as financial advisors to LVMH while New York-based law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom serves as legal counsel.

Paris-based LVMH, led by billionaire Bernard Arnault, says the deal will strengthen its position in high-end jewelry and in the U.S. market. The purchase gives the French conglomerate a new star in its already distinctive portfolio — one that will help it compete with Gucci-owner Kering Group and Cartier-owner Richemont SA.

LVMH already owns 75 brands including Christian Dior, Fendi, and Givenchy as well as watchmaker Tag Heuer. Its flagship brand Louis Vuitton recently opened a handbag workshop in Texas, with President Donald Trump in attendance.

LVMH said both companies' boards approved the deal and hope to finalize the takeover in 2020, subject to the approval of regulators and Tiffany shareholders.

The offer comes as luxury goods companies have been wrestling with changing habits of shoppers who are increasingly buying online. They’re also purchasing second-hand luxury items from places like The RealReal.com.

In addition, luxury companies are facing fears of an economic slowdown in China, a key area of business, while they're already dealing with a slowdown in international tourism in the U.S.

Under its CEO Alessandro Bogliolo, Tiffany is trying to appeal to younger shoppers with more modern takes on jewelry. Earlier this year, it launched a men's jewelry collection, and it's increasing its marketing to a more diverse customer base like same-sex couples. It's also been renovating its flagship store in Manhattan.

Still, Tiffany's U.S. sales have been stagnating as China's slowing economy has weighed on spending by Chinese tourists, who make up a substantial portion of luxury spending. The strong dollar has also made Tiffany products more expensive for consumers outside the U.S.

Tiffany has been putting plans in place to appeal to a younger group of customers who are more used to shopping online and hunting for fashion deals. Tiffany has notably highlighted ways customers can personalize jewelry and started letting people trace the origin of their diamonds.

Tiffany had sales of $4.4 billion in 2018, an increase of nearly 7% over 2017. LVMH reported 6.3 billion euros in profits in 2018 on 46.8 billion euros in sales."

PARIS — French luxury group LVMH has agreed to buy New York jeweler Tiffany & Co. for $16.2 billion, adding a famed star to its portfolio that already boasts Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Bulgari.

LVMH said in a statement Monday it will take over the 182-year old Tiffany and its 300 boutiques worldwide at $135 a share. The price tag is higher than the $14.5 billion cash offer LVMH made last month.

Tiffany, known for its delicate jewelry, distinctive blue boxes and an Audrey Hepburn movie, says the deal will ensure its long-term sustainability. The company is trying to transform its brand to appeal to younger and more digital shoppers, and could use an owner with deep pockets to help expand its business.

Shares in Tiffany rose more than 6% in late morning trading in New York, while LVMH was up 2% in Paris.

LVMH, led by billionaire Bernard Arnault, says the deal will strengthen its position in high-end jewelry and in the U.S. market. The purchase will help the French conglomerate compete with Gucci-owner Kering Group and Cartier-owner Richemont SA. With its purchase of Tiffany, LVMH is also making a big bet on China’s economy— Tiffany has been expanding its presence in China with plans to build more stores there.

LVMH already owns 75 brands including Christian Dior, Fendi, and Givenchy as well as watchmaker Tag Heuer. Its flagship brand Louis Vuitton recently opened a handbag workshop in Texas, with President Donald Trump in attendance.

LVMH said both companies’ boards approved the deal and hope to finalize the takeover in 2020, subject to the approval of regulators and Tiffany shareholders.

In addition, luxury companies are facing fears of an economic slowdown in China, a key area of business, while they’re already dealing with a slowdown in international tourism in the U.S.

Overall, the global market for personal luxury goods is healthy, reaching a record high of $286.53 (260 billion euros) in 2018 — a 6% increase from the year before, according to consulting firm Bain & Co. Jewelry in particular has been one of the top luxury growth categories, enjoying 7% sales increase to a little over $20 billion last year. Luxury sales in the Americas reached $88 billion (80 billion euro) last year, a growth rate of 5%, according to Bain & Co.

The U.S. luxury market has been helped by a strong economy and overall luxury spending by local consumers. However, a strong dollar has curbed spending by tourists from Asia and other countries.

Overall U.S. luxury sales, excluding jewelry, have fallen 2.7% so far this year compared to a 3.1% increase in overall retail sales, according to MasterCard SpendingPulse, which tracks sales across all types of payments including cash and checks. Jewelry sales, however, have risen 2.6% so far this year.

China’s sales in mainland China continue to be strong, according to Tiffany. To maintain its momentum, Tiffany is either opening or upgrading its flagship stores in three key metropolitan areas: Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. It’s also expanding its airport duty-free store networks. During the current quarter, it plans to open its first Tiffany store in a duty-free zone in mainland China at the Beijing Airport with a partner. This past fall, it relocated and upgraded its directly-owned store at the Hong Kong airport.

It’s also going after the Chinese online shopper. Tiffany launched a China e-commerce site in August, its 14th e-commerce enabled website globally.

Tiffany had sales of $4.4 billion in 2018, an increase of nearly 7% over 2017. LVMH reported 6.3 billion euros in profits in 2018 on 46.8 billion euros in sales.

LVMH Reportedly Close to Buying Tiffany for $16.7 Billion - The Business of Fashion,"Sun, 24 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9sdXh1cnkvbHZtaC1yZXBvcnRlZGx5LWNsb3NlLXRvLWJ1eWluZy10aWZmYW55LWZvci0xNi03LWJpbGxpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NEW YORK, United States — French luxury conglomerate LVMH is close to acquiring American jewellery company Tiffany & Co. for $16.7 billion, according to a report Sunday by the Financial Times.

The deal could close as soon as Sunday evening after the boards of the two luxury giants meet to finish discussing details, the FT reported. LVMH is reportedly buying the luxury jewellery company in an all-cash deal, at $135 a share, or a nearly 40 percent premium to where the stock traded before deal talks were first reported in October. Tiffany has some $350 million worth of net debt.

Tiffany and LVMH did not immediately respond to BoF’s request for comment.

LVMH initially offered $14.5 billion for Tiffany, but the company said the offer was too low in early November, according to Reuters. The deal could be announced as early as Monday, the FT reported.

LVMH has much to gain from buying the storied American jeweller. The world's largest luxury conglomerate and Europe's second-most valuable company owns luxury fashion brands such as Louis Vuitton, Celine, and Christian Dior, as well as the beauty retail giant Sephora. Its market capitalisation surpassed €200 billion on the Paris Stock Exchange in early November.

Acquiring Tiffany, one of the world’s largest and best-known jewellery brands, would allow LVMH to expand its presence in the US, as well as China, where Tiffany has grown its business in the region through a retail expansion.

Jewellery was also one of the best-performing categories for luxury in 2018, according to Bain & Co, which predicts that the global $20 billion market will grow 7 percent this year. Adding another global jewellery brand to its portfolio would also allow LVMH to gain further ground on Richemont , which owns Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels, and has long dominated the hard-luxury category.

Tiffany has over 300 stores around the world, but the company has had a difficult time in recent years. It's been updating its store experience, and recently hired former Barneys chief executive Daniella Vitale to reposition its brand identity. While the company continues to grow in China, it has struggled to win over Millennials and Gen-Z consumers in the West, as young shoppers move away from traditional occasion-based gifting and self-purchasing rises in popularity. In the first half of 2019, worldwide net sales at Tiffany decreased 3 percent to $2.1 billion.

At a Bloomberg conference in New York last week, Tiffany Chief Executive Alessandro Bogliolo addressed the changing market for luxury.

“When I was young, it was important to buy a famous brand and a beautiful product [but] Millennials have much more questions,” Bogliolo said. “They want to know why Tiffany is famous, what do they stand for, and why should I go to them.”

By joining LVMH's portfolio, Tiffany could tap into LVMH's extensive retail network, as well as its marketing and branding expertise.

Bogliolo added that he believed Tiffany fans wouldn’t care about the company getting acquired.

“Customers, they don’t care about your shareholders,” Bogliolo said. “Customers care about your product — about your brand, about sustainability, about the beauty of your products. This is what really makes success.”

Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos could lose his title as the richest person in the world this week after LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault signed to buy the jewelry giant Tiffany for $16 billion.

According to CNN, the deal led to Arnault’s net worth jumping more than 1% Monday and another 3% on Tuesday.

The French business magnate’s net worth is over $108 billion, while Bezos is still on top with a net worth of about $111 billion, according to Forbes' real-time list of the world's billionaires.

LVMH has 75 brands, ranging from wines to cosmetics targeted for the upmarket sector. Some of them include Dom Pérignon, Moet & Chandon, and Christian Dior and Givenchy.

Arnault's move comes days after Bill Gates briefly regained his title as the world’s richest person for the first time in two years. The Microsoft founder was ahead of Bezos after Amazon's quarterly earnings results, but the Amazon guru managed to reclaim his spot.

Former LVMH exec says Richemont could buy Tiffany - Yahoo Finance,"Wed, 27 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy90aWZmYW55LWlzLWEtcmFyZS1hc3NldC1pbi10aGUtd29ybGQtb2YtbHV4dXJ5LWZybS1sdm1oLWV4ZWMtMjA0OTI4OTk4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tiffany & Co. (TIF) said yes. The luxury jeweler has agreed to be acquired by LVMH (MC.PA) in a $16.2 billion deal.

The all-cash acquisition — which is the biggest deal under the Louis Vuitton parent — comes with hopes that Tiffany will strengthen LVMH’s portfolio of jewelry, and increase the brands United States presence.

Former Chairman of LVMH North America Pauline Brown told YFi PM that although the deal was announced, we may see other bidders step in the ring for Tiffany.

“Tiffany is a rare asset in the world of luxury,” Brown stated. “It's really a singular asset in the world of luxury jewelry. Even though the deal was announced, I wouldn't preclude the possibility that there'll be other bidders coming forward in the next few months. The deal won't close until mid 2020. And it was done at a very healthy price, but keep in mind that in 2018, Tiffany was actually trading at a higher price than where the deal closed as of yesterday.”

“The only one [company] that could justify [acquiring Tiffany] would be Richemont, which is not nearly as big,” Brown continued. “It's somewhere between... 20% and 25% the size of LVMH. But it is two to three times the size of LVMH in watches and jewelry. And Richemont, a European company, owns Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels. [It] owns many other jewelry brands. That is their core. That's their sweet spot. It is not LVMH’s sweet spot. In fact, only right now pre-Tiffany, only about 9% of LVMH of sales are in watch and jewelry.”

Tiffany’s sales and profits have been struggling over the past few years as the luxury brand continues to struggle to appeal to the younger generations.

Earlier this month, LVMH offered Tiffany $14.5 billion, or $120 a share in cash, to acquire the jeweler. Tiffany declined the offer, arguing that deal significantly undermined the brand.

“I think they started low [because] that was where they were going to anchor it,” Brown stated. “If you look at 2018, Tiffany traded at close to $140. So it's actually under its high watermark. And it is just such an extraordinary company. Now LVMH is taking a big bet on it. The closest deal that it did as a standalone acquisition was Bulgari, which was less than a third the price of that one. So they better make it work.”

Diamonds.net - LVMH Sees Value in Tiffany's Diamond Sourcing - Australian Diamonds,"Thu, 28 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHA6Ly93d3cuZGlhbW9uZHMubmV0L05ld3MvTmV3c0l0ZW0uYXNweD9BcnRpY2xlSUQ9NjQ0MTQmQXJ0aWNsZVRpdGxlPUxWTUgrU2VlcytWYWx1ZStpbitUaWZmYW55JUUyJTgwJTk5cytEaWFtb25kK1NvdXJjaW5n0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"



RAPAPORT... A storied past and popularity as a brand might be the first things that would attract a potential suitor to Tiffany & Co. But LVMH has identified another key attribute that made the US jeweler a valuable target: its ability to source its own diamonds and track its supply chain.



“Tiffany is [advanced], due to its very high level of vertical integration, compared to our own brands,” said Jean-Jacques Guiony, LVMH’s chief financial officer, in a conference call with analysts Tuesday. “We intend to capitalize on that and create synergies, and we are sure value can be extracted from combining the two business models in the group.”



Tiffany buys between 80% and 90% of its polished diamonds above 0.18 carats from mines as rough, and cuts them in-house, its CEO, Alessandro Bogliolo, said in a video interview with Bloomberg earlier this month. Laurelton Diamonds, Tiffany’s wholly owned manufacturing subsidiary, has long-term rough supply agreements with De Beers, Alrosa, Dominion Diamond Mines and Rio Tinto.



“It's opposite to the industry and other jewelers, which buy diamonds from the wholesale market,” Bogliolo added. “This…is very relevant for a millennial consumer. First of all, [a consumer will] go to Tiffany because they have the expertise.... The second point is that as we buy from the source, we can tell you where your diamond comes from.”



Tiffany sources more of its own goods than LVMH’s jewelry businesses do, Guiony noted on a call it held following its announcement that it was acquiring the New York retailer for $16.2 billion. Such a sourcing and manufacturing strategy is a “unique asset” that could work to the benefit of LVMH’s existing brands, and the French luxury group has no intention of changing the model, he added.



“Tiffany is a very big player in all sorts of diamonds, and it’s something where the sourcing is not easy to do, and we expect to benefit from that,” he told listeners, without expanding on how it would achieve this.



Room to grow



The acquisition will increase LVMH’s jewelry-and-watch sales to 16% of total revenue from 9%. While Tiffany has seen mixed results in recent years, LVMH has consistently reported strong growth in its jewelry and watch sales, with revenue for the category increasing 8% to EUR 1.13 billion ($1.24 billion) in the three months ending September 30.



The constant attention that comes from being an independently listed company with regular reporting obligations can make progress difficult for Tiffany, Guiony said. LVMH is also publicly traded, but doesn’t publish individual brands’ results.



“We will bring Tiffany time and capital, which is not easy to achieve as a company that has to report on a quarterly basis,” Guiony added.



One of the jeweler’s most costly projects, the renovation of its flagship Fifth Avenue store, received a strong endorsement from LVMH, though the buyer also indicated it should have happened a while ago. Tiffany has allocated up to 2% of its global sales on overhauling the crucial retail location, expecting to complete it in 2021.



“Despite the fact the flagship on Fifth Avenue was iconic, mostly due to the [1961] Blake Edwards movie [Breakfast at Tiffany’s], it’s also something the brand needs to invest in, and I think the plan they have is the right thing to do, not to mention that it was probably overdue,” Guiony explained. “I sympathize with the difficulty of taking the decision to refurbish a store of that size and importance, but at some point you have to go for it.”



Carry the brand



LVMH hopes to increase Tiffany’s revenue per square meter, or sales density, which is currently lower inside the US than outside. But this will come primarily from strengthening the brand, Guiony noted. Tiffany is also underrepresented in Europe, where it could do a better job of attracting both locals and tourists, Guiony observed.



The executive was content with Tiffany’s unusual mix of expensive engagement rings and lower-priced silver jewelry, both of which are major categories for the company.



“The question is not the price at which we sell [the] items, but whether such items carry the value of the brand,” he asserted. “Silver for Tiffany…is entry price and allows people to enter the brand with a few hundred dollars, and we have no problem whatsoever with this line.”



Meanwhile, the importance of collections was a key lesson LVMH learned from its $5.2 billion acquisition of Bulgari in 2011, and one it hoped to apply with Tiffany, Guiony noted. The significant expansion of Bulgari’s share of sales from collections has boosted revenue and profit in recent years, he explained.



“In this respect, Tiffany is well positioned, but we’ll insist in the future on the importance of capitalizing on existing collections and developing new ones,” he predicted.

The deal could be worth as much as $14.5 billion, which would make it LVMH's most expensive acquisition ever.

Analysts say the deal would make strategic sense for LVMH as it looks to build out its luxury jewelry offering and better compete with rivals Kering and Richemont.

This is especially pertinent as jewelry is one of the fastest-growing sectors in luxury.

This week the world's biggest luxury conglomerate, LVMH, put forward a bid to acquire iconic American jewelry maker Tiffany & Co. in a deal that could be worth as much as $14.5 billion.

While some analysts said that Tiffany may reject the offer in pursuit of more money, the news sparked a discussion around what this would mean for both LVMH and its main rivals, Kering and Richemont.

While LVMH has more than 75 brands in its portfolio, analysts say it's lacking when it comes to fine jewelry, while Richemont and Kering have more exposure in that area. Richemont is particularly strong here, with Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels, two of the world's most famous jewelry brands. Chances are LVMH wants to rectify this.

""Hard luxury is the only sub-sector where LVMH is not the leader, and we know that Mr Arnault likes to be always #1,"" RBC analyst Rogerio Fujimori wrote in a note to clients on Sunday, referring to LVMH's billionaire CEO Bernard Arnault.

Fujimori said that it's especially significant that LVMH would beef up the jewelry portion of its portfolio as this sector is considered to be one of the fastest-growing areas in luxury. Last year, growth in jewelry outpaced luxury handbags, apparel, and watches, growing by 7%, according to a recent report from Bain.

There are several things about Tiffany that make the brand a particularly appealing acquisition, according to Fujimori. The brand name is well-recognized, it's a global player (and, crucially, one of the top jewelry brands in China), and it has an accessible price point, which all help LVMH to reach a wider audience.

Moreover, as 44% of Tiffany's sales are done in the US, Canada, and Latin America, it gives European-headquartered LVMH a more balanced exposure to the US market, which would be helpful when it comes to US tariffs.

Tiffany could be heading toward a bidding war

For Tiffany, which has seen slowing sales in recent years and is in the middle of executing a turnaround under its new CEO, former Bulgari veteran Alessandro Bogliolo, the backing of a luxury powerhouse could help it to better craft its marketing and grow its digital platform in the future.

But because of Tiffany's global brand image and the fact that there are very few players in this particular market, Fujimori isn't discounting a bidding war for the company.

""Never say never,"" he wrote in an updated note to clients on Wednesday, adding that LVMH's big advantage here is that it has ""much deeper pockets"" than its rivals.

Other analysts said that it doesn't make financial sense for Kering or Richemont to try and outbid LVMH.

""Kering would be in theory the most motivated buyer, given its hard luxury ambitions and lack of a jewelry mega-brand. But, outbidding LVMH would stretch Kering's balance sheet to levels its financially disciplined senior management wouldn't feel comfortable with,"" a group of Bernstein analysts led by Luca Solca wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.

They added: ""Richemont is likely not interested, as they have plenty of (better) brands of their own they could grow organically.""

""It's either LVMH, or back to the drawing board trying to unlock value organically,"" they said.

These Bernstein analysts are advising Tiffany to think carefully about holding out for a sweeter deal.

""This is a takeover inspired by reason, not by passion,"" they wrote. ""It makes sense to buy Tiffany at the right price ... But if Tiffany doesn't play ball, it is also OK to leave it alone."""
What acquiring Tiffany for $16.2 billion does for LVMH - Vogue Business,"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy93aGF0LWFjcXVpcmluZy10aWZmYW55LWRvZXMtZm9yLWx2bWgtbHV4dXJ5LXJpY2hlbW9udNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Key takeaways:

The acquisition will instantly make LVMH a major player in hard luxury and ramp up competition for Richemont brands like Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels.

The move represents one of LVMH’s last opportunities to buy an established jewellery brand with global appeal and is a rare example of the French group acquiring a company in turnaround mode.

LVMH has entered into a definitive agreement with Tiffany & Co. to buy the US jewellery company for $16.2 billion. Pending approval from Tiffany’s shareholders and regulatory authorities, the all-cash deal — the largest-ever transaction in the personal luxury goods space — will likely go through in mid-2020.

The deal values the US jeweller at $135 a share, up from the $120 that LVMH had initially offered. It will be the largest-ever takeover led by LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault, beating out what the French group paid to acquire full control of Dior in 2017. Luca Solca, an analyst at Bernstein, said the agreement is “good news for both shareholder bases”, though it is slightly pricier than the investment bank had expected.

The move will also increase LVMH’s exposure in the US from 24 per cent of revenue to 26 per cent, per Mediobanca estimates. That said, LVMH has a mixed track record of integrating US brands — its experience with the now-disposed Donna Karan being a case in point. Europe only represents 11 per cent of Tiffany’s sales, a proportion that LVMH CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony said in a conference call on Monday “could be stronger”.

Nevertheless, at 16 times trailing EBITDA, the price represents relatively good value for LVMH, which paid 28 times trailing EBITDA in 2011 for Bulgari, its last major fine jewellery acquisition. The move represents one of LVMH’s last opportunities to buy an established jewellery brand with global appeal. Tiffany is the fifth largest jewellery company in the world, representing 0.9 per cent of global industry shares, per Euromonitor."
LVMH hires Brunswick Group for Tiffany acquisition - PR Week,"Tue, 26 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByd2Vlay5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xNjY3MDI1L2x2bWgtaGlyZXMtYnJ1bnN3aWNrLWdyb3VwLXRpZmZhbnktYWNxdWlzaXRpb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS: Luxury giant LVMH has enlisted Brunswick Group for PR support as it acquires Tiffany & Co. in a deal worth $16.2 billion.

Work on the account is being led by Brunswick U.S. senior partner and CEO of the Americas Nik Deogun and partner Jonathan Doorley, as well as Paris-based partner Aurélia de Lapeyrouse, who heads employee engagement expertise in France for the agency.

Brunswick was hired specifically for this assignment, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Meanwhile, Tiffany has engaged the services of Sard Verbinnen & Co., an agency the jewelry company has worked with in the past. Sard staffers list Tiffany work on their website bios.

Chairman and co-CEO George Sard, MD Paul Scarpetta and MD Chris Kittredge work on the account in the U.S., while the agency’s London principal Eve Young will lead in the U.K.

Brunswick declined to comment. A Sard representative couldn’t be reached for comment.

After weeks of waiting, LVMH and Tiffany jointly announced a deal had been reached at $135 per share earlier this week after both companies’ boards gave their approval.

They expect the acquisition to be finalized in mid-2020 after it clears the necessary regulatory and shareholder hurdles, according to CNBC, which first broke the news last week that the two companies reached a deal.

Founded in 1837 in New York, Tiffany rose to become a leading global luxury brand. LVMH, which houses 75 other brands, said in a statement that Tiffany will ""transform"" its watches and jewelry division.

Tiffany has seen annual sales and profit fall between 2015 and 2017, according to CNBC. The company’s revenue growth bounced back in 2017. In recent years, sales in the U.S. and Asia have been damaged by the U.S.-China trade war, among other factors.

Citi and J.P. Morgan served as financial advisors to LVMH, while Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom served as legal counsel, according to a joint statement. For Tiffany, Centerview Partners and Goldman Sachs served as financial advisors and Sullivan & Cromwell served as legal counsel."
LVMH Buys American Jeweler Tiffany & Co. for $16.2 Billion - Robb Report,"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vc3R5bGUvamV3ZWxyeS9sdm1oLWJ1eXMtdGlmZmFueS1jby1pbi0xNi0yLWJpbGxpb24tZGVhbC0yODgzMjIwL9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vc3R5bGUvamV3ZWxyeS9sdm1oLWJ1eXMtdGlmZmFueS1jby1pbi0xNi0yLWJpbGxpb24tZGVhbC0yODgzMjIwL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As the old adage goes: If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again. And that certainly seems to have proven true for LVMH.

One month after the French luxury behemoth made news by submitting a $14.5 billion bid to buy iconic American jeweler Tiffany & Co., the holding company has finally got its brand, according to the Financial Times. LVMH has reportedly “clinched” the deal after upping its offer to $16.2 billion.

Confirmed in a press release Monday morning, the sale will see the luxury holding company buy Tiffany, best known for its diamond engagement rings, for $135 per share in cash. That’s a significant increase over the $120 per share offer LVMH initially put forward. The purchase price comes out to an equity value of about $16.2 billion, which represents a 37 percent premium over the jeweler’s stock price ($98.55 per share) the day before the news of the initial bid went public. The deal reportedly includes $350 million in net debt.

“We have an immense respect and admiration for Tiffany and intend to develop this jewel with the same dedication and commitment that we have applied to each and every one of our Maisons,” said a “delighted” Bernard Arnault, LVMH chairman and CEO, in the statement. “We will be proud to have Tiffany sit alongside our iconic brands and look forward to ensuring that Tiffany continues to thrive for centuries to come.”

The deal is the largest ever in the luxury sector, according to the Financial Times. Despite this, some analysts have questioned the move since news of the approach first broke last month, wondering why LVMH would want to purchase a brand no longer considered top-tier, especially since it already purchased Bulgari for $5.2 billion in 2011. But after a rough patch, Tiffany is starting to turn around thanks in part to its new CEO, Alessandro Bogliolo, who has been at the helm since 2017. He spent 16 years in various executive roles at Bulgari, both before and after its LVMH acquisition.

WATCH

The acquisition will give LVMH a stronger foothold in the jewelry market, allowing it to better compete with the likes of Switzerland’s Richemont Group in one of the fastest-growing sectors of the luxury market. The deal will also increase LVMH’s presence in the United States, its second-biggest market internationally after Asia. Last month’s opening of a Louis Vuitton factory in Texas made clear that this America is a big priority for the French house.

Update: On Tuesday, February 4, the Tiffany & Co.’s shareholders approved the sale of the jeweler to LVMH, reports AFP. In a statement, the holding company said, “stockholders of Tiffany & Co have voted overwhelmingly to approve the previously announced merger agreement relating to the proposed acquisition of Tiffany by LVMH.”"

This leaves many great retailers, even those in major markets, with clients that are frustrated when their watches do not perform as well as those retailed by Tiffany on the secondary market. Further, it is common for most watch retailer agreements to feature a ""change of ownership"" clause, meaning that should any retailer's majority ownership change, the distributor has a right to cancel the distribution agreement. This would, of course, give Patek Philippe a graceful exit to the relationship that has caused this disparity among one retailers and all others - a disparity that would likely only continue to worsen as global watch tastes continue to homogenize. Having said that, there have been rumors that Patek Philippe will be offered for sale in the coming years and one of the only luxury groups in the world that would have the means to purchase it at a significant price is LVMH. So perhaps the Sterns will continue to allow Tiffany to sell its watches as a nod to a potential suitor down the road. Only time will tell.

Finally, regardless of Patek Philippe's future with Tiffany & Co., which is not a meaningful number for either company, one wonders if LVMH might use the Tiffany platform to create demand for its own watch brands. Will we soon see Tiffany-signed TAG Heuers, Zeniths, and Hublots? The move would certainly create a lot of buzz within the community and perhaps jumpstart the three brands into higher levels of collectibility."

LVMH remains engaged and is considering a new offer, according to the sources. The exact numbers being discussed could not be learned. Sources have previously said Tiffany's board saw a private level of $140 per share, which its shares reached last year, as key to reaching a deal.

Tiffany Sold To French Luxury Goods Company LVMH - Gothamist,"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZ290aGFtaXN0LmNvbS9uZXdzL3RpZmZhbnktc29sZC1mcmVuY2gtbHV4dXJ5LWdvb2RzLWNvbXBhbnktbHZtaNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tiffany & Company, the famed jewelry company and proud purveyor of $9,000 balls of silver yarn, has been acquired by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world’s largest luxury goods company, in a $16.2 billion deal that marries a storied American brand with a suite of high-end French labels.

The deal, which has been in the works for weeks, was said to be the largest ever in the luxury sector. It allows LVMH, whose brands include Dior, Givenchy, Fendi, Dom Pérignon and Bulgari, to further expand into the luxury jewelry market, while bolstering Tiffany as it tries to reinvent itself amid a shrinking demand for luxury goods.

""This transaction, which occurs at a time of internal transformation for our legendary brand, will provide further support, resources and momentum for those priorities as we evolve towards becoming The Next Generation Luxury Jeweler,"" said Alessandro Bogliolo, the Chief Executive Officer of Tiffany, said in a statement. ""As part of the LVMH group, Tiffany will reach new heights, capitalizing on its remarkable internal expertise, unparalleled craftsmanship and strong cultural values.”

The 182-year-old company, which is headquartered in NYC and has more than 300 locations worldwide, takes in about $4.4 billion in annual revenue, but has been struggling in recent years in both the U.S. and China markets, its two strongholds. A recent Wall Street Journal story noted that Tiffany executives in August warned that the protests in Hong Kong along with a global economic slowdown could flatten sales for the remainder of the year.

In recent years, Tiffany has been trying out new strategies to attract millennials. In January, the company announced an effort to shed light on the ethical origins of the company's diamonds and gems amid concerns about their links to violence and tyrannical regimes. Just last month, Tiffany announced the launch of its first-ever men's collection.

The flagship store on the corner of 57th Street and Fifth Avenue opened in 1940. It is currently in the beginning of a three year renovation. According to Bloomberg, the store accounts for as much as 10 percent of Tiffany's annual sales. The retailer has three other locations in New York City: Rockefeller Center, Soho and Wall Street.

Robin Abrams, a veteran New York City retail broker at Compass, told Gothamist that she did not expect the deal to shrink Tiffany's footprint in the city. If anything, she said, the new ownership will give the company ""a little bit more strength"" to negotiate its lease deals because LVMH can leverage its other luxury brands, which have a strong retail presence in New York City.

Tiffany, she said, is ""an iconic brand that has been around a long time and has deep roots. It's a smart acquisition for LVMH."""
LVMH's ex-boss slams Tesla's Cybertruck as a 'big miss' - Yahoo Finance,"Wed, 27 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9mb3JtZXItbHZtaC1leGVjLW9uLXRlc2xhLWN5YmVydHJ1Y2staXRzLWEtZGlzYXN0ZXItMjEyMDM2OTAyLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Count Pauline Brown, the former Chairman of LVMH North America, as one of the critics of Tesla’s (TSLA) new Cybertruck.

Amid much fanfare and merciless skewering of its design, CEO Elon Musk unveiled the eco-friendly truck last week. The rocky rollout and lackluster reviews of the Cybertruck’s design initially drove down Tesla’s stock, which recouped its losses after Musk revealed that over hundreds of thousands of customers had reserved orders for the vehicle.

Still, critics have taken aim at the Cybertruck’s unconventional design. And with that in mind, Brown had some strong words for one electric carmaker.

“I think Tesla, which I've talked about publicly, the launch of that truck — I think it's a disaster,” she told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview.

“I don't even think it would have been pleasing for Soviet-era armed trucks,” Brown said, adding that the vehicle’s strange design was “a big miss” for the electric car maker.

The author of the book “Aesthetic Intelligence” has ideas of her own for car designs, and her words carry some weight. LVMH (MC.PA) is the parent company of over 70 prestigious brands ranging from Christian Dior to Givenchy. LVMH is in the process of closing a $16.2 billion deal to acquire jeweler Tiffany (TIF).

When Musk unveiled the unconventional truck at an event in Los Angeles last week, the six-passenger pickup’s “armored glass” notoriously smashed during a demonstration.

Yet despite the rocky introduction, Musk boasted that the truck has secured around 250,000 orders as of this week.

Meanwhile, Brown has automobile ambitions of her own. She told Yahoo Finance that as a next possible opportunity, “I would love to take on the automotive world. Some brands are more elegantly designed than others, more interestingly designed than others.”

The reason is that few automakers “really think about the interiors from a textile standpoint,” she said, adding that most automakers rarely “use colors that feel different and interesting and exciting.”

French luxury group LVMH has persuaded U.S. jewelry chain Tiffany & Co to provide it with confidential due diligence after it raised its bid to close to $16 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.

The development represents a key milestone in LVMH's bid for the iconic U.S. maker of engagement rings. Tiffany earlier this month rebuffed LVMH's initial $120-per-share all-cash offer, arguing it significantly undervalues it.

Tiffany agreed to provide LVMH with access to its books, after the latter sweetened its bid to close to $130 per share, the sources said. Tiffany plans to continue to negotiate for a better offer, and there is no certainty a deal will be reached, the sources added.

LVMH and Tiffany did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Tiffany shares jumped 3.6% to $127.75 in after-hours trading in New York on the news on Tuesday.

Jewelry was one of the strongest performing areas of the luxury industry in 2018, according to consultancy Bain & Co, which forecast that comparable sales in the $20 billion global market were set to grow 7% this year.

Tiffany, founded in New York in 1837 and featured in the 1961 movie ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" starring Audrey Hepburn, had struggled with falling annual sales and profit since 2015, before a revenue turnaround in 2017.

Under Chief Executive Alessandro Bogliolo, former head of fashion firm Diesel and a Bulgari alumnus, Tiffany has been building up its e-commerce business, and is trying to court younger shoppers with more affordable pendants and earrings and new designs.

However, LVMH believes Tiffany needs to spend more on reinventing and marketing its brands, and that it can achieve this only as a division of LVMH, according to the sources.

LVMH's 2011 purchase of Bulgari boosted its smallest and newest business division, jewelry and watches, which also includes Hublot and Tag Heuer watches. Nonetheless, that business accounted for 9% of revenue and 7% of LVMH earnings in 2018, about only a fifth the size of its core fashion and handbag business, home to brands like Christian Dior, Givenchy and Louis Vuitton.

Acquiring Tiffany would increase LVMH's exposure to the bridal and diamond category, as well as to U.S. luxury shoppers. Should there be a deal, LVMH plans to keep the Bulgari and Tiffany's brands separate, according to one of the sources."

Tiffany & Co. – the beloved American luxury jewellery brand that makes you think of wedding rings, sterling silver and of course their iconic blue – has been snapped up by French multinational conglomerate LVMH for a cool £12.6 billion (AU$23.99 billion).

According to Bloomberg, it’s the biggest luxury-goods deal ever, and the acquisition of Tiffany & Co. adds to LVMH’s long, long list of brands – or ‘maisons’ – already under its name.

LVMH – which itself stands for Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy – is an empire of roughly 70 brands.

ADVERTISEMENT

The brands can be split into more than five categories, including wines and spirits, fashion and leather goods, perfumes and cosmetics, watches and jewellery, and selective retailing, as well as other brands that don’t quite fit anywhere else like hotel chains, luxury yacht, financial paper and bicycle brands.

All in all, their total assets amount to 128.55 billion euros, according to LVMH’s 2017 annual report.

Here are just a few other brands the empire owns:

Wines and Spirits

Your Veuve Clicquot, Hennessy, Belvedere, Dom Perignon, and Chateau Cheval Blanc – and many more – are owned by LVMH.

The French giant’s oldest brand is Chateau d’Yquem, which stretches as far back as the 16th century.

Fashion and leather goods

LVMH has a stake in several high-end household names such as Christian Dior, Fendi, Givenchy, Marc Jacobs, Berluti, Celine and Rihanna’s Fenty.

However, a number of more affordable labels are there too, such as Singapore-founded Charles & Keith and Kenzo.

Perfumes and cosmetics

Many of LVMH’s fashion and leather goods brands also do perfumes, and so Givenchy Parfums, Kenzo Parfums, Parfums Christian Dior, Fenty Beauty by Rihanna and Marc Jacobs Beauty all fall under the LVMH umbrella.

Among this is list is also Acqua di Parma, Guerlain, Kat Von D Beauty and the more affordable Benefit Cosmetics.

Watches and jewellery

Hublot, BVLGARI, TAG Heuer, FRED, Chaumet, Zenith are among these ranks, with Tiffany the latest to be added to the list.

Selective retailing

DFS, Le Bon Marche and Starboard Cruise Services are LVMH brands, as well as makeup chain Sephora.

The third richest man in the world

The chairman and chief executive of LVMH, 70-year-old Bernard Arnault, is the US$106 billion (AU$156.41 billion) man behind the luxury goods empire.

As the richest man in Europe and Forbes’ fourth richest man in the world at the time of writing, Arnault joined his father’s construction company after graduating in 1971, which he eventually took over.

Arnault then acquired Boussac Saint-Freres, a textile company in turmoil, which owned Christian Dior.

After the creation of the LVMH group in 1987, he would then go on to mediate a conflict between the CEOs of Moet Hennessy and Louis Vuitton at the time. LVMH owned the rights to Dior perfume that Arnault felt should be incorporated into Dior.

Eventually, Arnault was elected chairman of the LVMH group, and has made it into one of the largest luxury empires in the world.

His daughter, Delphine, is vice president of Louis Vuitton.

LVMH's purchase of Tiffany puts pressure on jewelry rival Richemont - spglobal.com,"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwZ2xvYmFsLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRpbnRlbGxpZ2VuY2UvZW4vbmV3cy1pbnNpZ2h0cy90cmVuZGluZy9UazlrakwwbWFMNGJYWHhIblZuUFN3MtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton Société Européenne's $16.2 billion purchase of Tiffany & Co. will make it a significantly larger purveyor of high-end watches and jewelry and potentially threaten the dominance of Switzerland's Compagnie Financière Richemont SA, owner of some of the world's most famous jewelry brands, including Cartier, Piaget and Van Cleef & Arpels.

With a market cap of more than $200 billion, LVMH may be the biggest luxury company in the world, but when it comes to ""hard luxury"" — jewelry and watches — it has long lagged behind Richemont. In 2018, Richemont's revenue from the hard luxury segment totaled €9.16 billion, compared to €4.2 billion for LVMH.

Given that Tiffany reported revenue of €4 billion in 2018, owning the American jeweler will boost LVMH's hard luxury sales to about €8.2 billion — within striking range of Richemont's sales. The percentage of sales that LVMH generates from jewelry and watches will then jump to 14.8% from about 8.5% today, according to a recent analysis by S&P Global Market Intelligence.

""The merger of LVMH and Tiffany further steps up the competitive pressure in jewelry,"" said Luca Solca, an analyst at Bernstein, in an emailed response to Market Intelligence. Solca noted that other companies, including Gucci-owner Kering SA, Hermès International Société en commandite par actions and Chanel SA, also made recent forays into the jewelry sector, attracted by its higher growth compared to the average of the luxury sector. ""This means that incumbents such as Cartier will have to work harder.""

The hard luxury market reported overall sales of nearly $80 billion in 2018 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of more than 10% between 2019 and 2026 to reach sales of about $175 billion seven years from now, according to a June report published by New York-based firm Zion Market Research. Zion said the increase would be driven by the rise in the number of high-net-worth individuals, the flourishing fashion industry and the growing popularity of online purchases. Luxury companies are also vying to attract big-spending Chinese shoppers and younger consumers.

An analysis published earlier in 2019 by consulting firm Bain & Co. said shoes and jewelry were the top luxury growth categories in 2018, gaining 7% each, followed by handbags and beauty. Watches remained flat, the analysis said, while ""apparel suffered, mainly due to lackluster sales in the menswear segment.""

LVMH already owns jewelry brands such as Fred, Bulgari and Chaumet and watchmakers TAG Heuer, Hublot and Zenith. Analysts say that to make the acquisition of Tiffany work, LVMH will need to harness its vast scale to boost sales at Tiffany, especially in the crucial Asia market.

The French company also needs to push lower-priced Tiffany products further upmarket to take on elite European brands such as Cartier, they add. For this, LVMH can lean on its experience in running Bulgari, which it acquired in 2011. Tiffany CEO Alessandro Bogliolo was previously COO of Bulgari and spent 16 years at the Italian jeweler.

Richemont, meanwhile, has stumbled lately. Its sales and profit numbers for the first half of fiscal 2020 missed analysts' estimates as it was buffeted by anti-government protests in Hong Kong that reduced spending.

""Hong Kong is a market for us which is very strongly exposed to jewelry and watches,"" said Richemont CFO Burkhart Grund, on a Nov. 8 earnings call with analysts. ""And that obviously hit us in the second quarter much stronger than in the first quarter. I think in Q1 we flagged that the market was down by about 10% ... and then in Q2, the drop was quite severe in a very short period of time.""

Some analysts have warned that Richemont's Cartier brand was showing broader signs of weakness. ""We think the current stock price is not discounting the emerging signs of slowing Cartier brand momentum with Chinese consumers and the short-term industry headwinds,"" wrote Zuzanna Pusz, an analyst at UBS, in a note published on Sept 17. The UBS note also said it had assigned a 12-month ""sell"" rating on the company’s stock, from a previous rating of ""neutral.""

In response to an analyst's question about competing against the LVMH-Tiffany tie-up, Grund on the call said Richemont had ""three of the best assets"" in the jewelry business, including Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels.

In September, Richemont made an acquisition of its own: luxury Italian jewelry house Buccellati Holding Italia SpA for €230 million. ""It's something that, with its distinctive style and heritage, is very complementary to the portfolio we have,"" Grund said."

The LVMH-owned, Hong Kong-based DFS Group has been tapped to fill retail space in a bid to win over the coveted market of Chinese luxury shoppers.

After acquiring La Samaritaine in 2001 for a reported sum of €225 million EUR (approximately $249 million USD), LVMH made plans to renovate the historic store, which was originally constructed by Frantz Jourdain in 1910. Viewed as an iconic example of Art Nouveau design, the completed structure foretold the modernist architecture movement that blossomed in the 1920s. However, safety risks led LVMH to close La Samaritaine to the public in 2005, citing flaws like its delicate glass flooring.

Japanese architecture firm SANAA has since been brought in to revamp the facade, executing a flowing wave of glass on top of the concrete that partially surrounds the storefront. Furthermore, various structures ranging in age from the 1600s to the 1930s were merged to create the new La Samaritaine, occasionally to the complaints of neighbors.

Once it reopens, the new department store will shuttle in travelers by way of tour buses that can park in the nearby Louvre museum parking lot. There’s also a commuter train station nearby that was updated by the government of Paris as part of a nearly €1 billion EUR (approximately $1.1 billion USD) city renovation package. Duty-free checkout at each register further sweetens the deal, with shoppers granted access to attractions like a five-star Cheval Blanc hotel, Dior-branded spa and various on-brand storefronts.

Visit La Samaritaine’s website to keep up with the renovations and expect the revamped department store to open its doors in April 2020.

Meanwhile, Shibuya’s PARCO mall is reopening with a host of new outposts, including Dior, AMBUSH, visvim, Yoshida PORTER and more."
LVMH to Buy Tiffany After Raising Offer - Morningstar,"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcm5pbmdzdGFyLmNvLnVrL3VrL25ld3MvMTk3NTM0L2x2bWgtdG8tYnV5LXRpZmZhbnktYWZ0ZXItcmFpc2luZy1vZmZlci5hc3B40gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Louis Vuitton owner LVMH (MC), the world’s largest luxury brand, is to buy US firm Tiffany (TIF) for $16 billion, a month after the bid was first announced.

Paris-listed LVMH shares rose 1.5% to 402 euros, while US-listed Tiffany surged nearly 6% to $132, having already spiked when the deal was announced in October.

The LVMH bid was worth $14.5 billion last month, or $120 per share, but that has now been raised to $135 per share.

Morningstar raised its fair value estimate for Tiffany to $135 after the deal was announced but the deal is not expected to have an impact on the analysts' valuation for LVMH.

Luxury analyst Jelena Sokolova says the price paid for for Tiffany is steep: ""The high price paid underscores the scarcity of established fine jewellery brands in the market and high entry barriers to this industry, in our opinion.""

While Sokolova says that Tiffany is “one of few global iconic jewellery brands”, its profit margin growth would need to be higher to justify the valuation implied by the LVMH deal. The current operating profit margin of 18% would need to push higher to 25% in this case.

She adds that Tiffany is expected to operate as a standalone in the LVMH group, but will benefit from better negotiating terms with landlords, as well as pooling R&D resources.

Tiffany, which dates back to 1837, has a “wide” economic moat, or sustainable competitive advantage, Sokolova says: “Tiffany’s brand equity is supported by iconic and long-lived collections, instantly recognisable blue boxes, and the ‘Tiffany blue’ colour.”

“Although the quality of locations can vary, with around 300 stores, Tiffany is on par with Cartier and Hermes, arguably the most exclusive among big luxury brands,” she adds.

Sokolova also says that store openings, refurbishments and brand building exercises will be needed if Tiffany is to unlock its growth potential.

Luxury sector valuations have been under pressure in recent years from a variety of challenges, including a slowdown in global growth and a crackdown on luxury gifts among Chinese officials.

Some analysts believe these fears have given opportunities for investors to gain exposure to the Asian growth story.

Lindsell Train Global Equity fund manager bought into Italian fashion chain Prada in September. The manager of the Silver-rated fund, Michael Lindsell, says “the company is uniquely positioned with its high sales exposure to China and other Asian countries”."
The Deal to Buy Tiffany & Co. Could Make LVMH’s Bernard Arnault the World’s Richest Person - Robb Report,"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbXVzZS9pbnZlc3RpbmctZmluYW5jZS9iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtb24tdHJhY2stdG8tYmUtdGhlLXdvcmxkcy13ZWFsdGhpZXN0LXBlcnNvbi0yODgzNDA5L9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbXVzZS9pbnZlc3RpbmctZmluYW5jZS9iZXJuYXJkLWFybmF1bHQtb24tdHJhY2stdG8tYmUtdGhlLXdvcmxkcy13ZWFsdGhpZXN0LXBlcnNvbi0yODgzNDA5L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Apparently, little blue boxes can come with a lot more than just a sparkling ring. Billions more, actually. With the acquisition of Tiffany & Co. for his prestigious LVMH group and its stable of heritage brands, Bernard Arnault shelled out $16.2 billion in the largest luxury deal ever. In the process, he may have also set himself on track to become the world’s richest person, unseating both Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.

According to Forbes, Arnault’s personal net worth jumped $2.1 billion from Sunday amid news of a finalized deal between LVMH and Tiffany & Co. Though it only represents a 1 percent increase, the deal brings the magnate’s personal wealth valuation to a staggering $106 billion. Arnault and his family own a whopping 47 percent of the group which holds Louis Vuitton as its crown jewel and largest cash cow

Gates currently has a net worth of just under $107 billion and Jeff Bezos, the world’s richest person at the time of publication, has a net worth just over $110 billion, according to Forbes. If the deal with Tiffany leads to greater interest in the brand overall with increased revenue to match, it stands to reason that Arnault could soon dethrone Bezos. The trio may be in a tight race the likes of which few can truly understand. The next wealthiest person, Warren Buffet, is roughly $20 billion behind at $86 billion.

The deal with Tiffany & Co. comes after weeks of intense speculation and publicity. Despite its lofty reputation, Tiffany has struggled to stay relevant in recent years amid sluggish sales and the emergence of online shopping. Time will tell if Arnault—who built his reputation acquiring and reinvigorated luxury brands ranging from Louis Vuitton and Dior to Berluti and Hermès—can work his magic once more with the venerable jeweler. One thing is sure: few will bet against it."
LVMH's Kendo Appoints New President - WWD,"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3dkLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlL2x2bWgtb3duZWQta2VuZG8tbmFtZXMta3Jpc3Rpbi13YWxjb3R0LXByZXNpZGVudC0xMjAzMzc2MjAwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Kendo has made a series of executive appointments, including promoting Kristin Walcott, previously senior vice president and global general manager, to president, WWD has learned.

In addition to Walcott, Heather Fisher has been promoted to senior vice president of global marketing effective as of January, and Elizabeth Hayes will join Kendo as senior vice president of product strategy in February.

“Kristin has an unwavering and unparalleled dedication to beauty innovation, product quality and differentiated storytelling,” David Suliteanu, chief executive officer of Kendo, said in a statement. “As president, her brand-building acumen and global vision, as well as her talent for fostering strong leaders and teams, will be pivotal to Kendo’s continued success.”

Walcott was part of Kendo’s founding team in 2014. In her new role, she will continue to guide the company’s global portfolio and “perpetuate the Kendo formula for success,” the company statement exclusively shared with WWD. She will report to Suliteanu.

Kendo brands include Fenty Beauty by Rihanna, Marc Jacobs Beauty, Kat Von D Beauty, Ole Henriksen and Bite Beauty. All are sold at LVMH-owned Sephora, as well as through select outside distribution. Fenty, which Kendo developed with Rihanna, has been the company’s most recent success, doing $500 million in sales in its first year.

Before founding Kendo, Walcott spent seven years with Sephora, most recently as vice president of business development and merchandising, and before that, worked for L’Oréal Paris.

Fisher’s promotion comes after she successfully spearheaded marketing for the global launch of Fenty Beauty in 2017. She is the vice president of global marketing for Fenty Beauty, and before that, was at Kendo as senior director of global brand marketing. Before joining Kendo, Fisher worked at Bare Escentuals for six years.

Hayes joins Kendo from Sephora, where she leads the Sephora Collection line. Her role as senior vice president of product strategy is a new one — previously, those responsibilities fell directly under Walcott. Hayes has been with Sephora for nearly 13 years, starting as the head merchant for LVMH makeup brands. Before Sephora, she worked for Gap Inc.

At Sephora, Brooke Banwart will become the new vice president and general manager for the Sephora Collection as of Feb. 18. Banwart is currently vice president of fragrance at Sephora, where she has worked for about six years. After Banwart’s shift to the Sephora Collection, Carye Campbell, senior director of merchandising for fragrance, and Laura Parke, senior merchant for fragrance, will report into Artemis Patrick, chief merchandising officer, until Banwart’s replacement is named.

Mazal! LVMH to Buy Tiffany & Co. for $16.2 Billion - JCK,"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpja29ubGluZS5jb20vZWRpdG9yaWFsLWFydGljbGUvbHZtaC1idXktdGlmZmFueS0xNi0yLWJpbGxpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH will break bread with Tiffany, though the famed retailer will hardly go lightly.

In what some are describing as the biggest deal ever in the luxury goods segment, LVMH will pay $16.2 billion for Tiffany & Co., in a deal that ends the retailer’s 32 years as an independent public company.

The sale was approved by both company’s boards yesterday, said a statement from LVMH.

This is the priciest acquisition in LVMH’s history, more than doubling the $7 billion it paid for Christian Dior in 2017.

The final price comes out to $135 a share. That is a little shy of the $139 benchmark Tiffany’s board had reportedly sought, given its stock reached that level last year.

But it tops the luxury conglomerate’s original late-October bid of $120 a share and its reported follow-up bid of $130—not to mention the $98 Tiffany’s stock was trading at prior to all this becoming public.

The company’s shares closed at $125 on Friday, before it was revealed over the weekend the two sides had reached a deal. At press time, it was trading at $133.

According to the Financial Times, “after LVMH’s interest became public, Tiffany’s advisers received a number of inquiries from rival luxury goods groups. But none of the alternative approaches were seen as compelling.”

An LVMH presentation said that the acquisition will make it a player in fine jewelry, increasing the size of its watches and jewelry division from 9% of sales to 16%.

It said that LVMH plans to leverage Tiffany’s heritage and brand awareness, iconic collections, and commitment to sustainable sourcing and traceable provenance, and will “accelerate [its] ongoing strategy as part of LVMH.”

Some thought it noteworthy that LVMH repeatedly called out Tiffany’s commitment to sustainability, which in recent years has come to define the brand.

According to The Wall Street Journal, LVMH executives view “Tiffany as a ‘sleeping beauty,’ a brand with great promise, but one that sat out the recent uptick in the jewelry market.”

LVMH sees Tiffany’s “wide range of prices as a good way to attract younger shoppers,” the company added.

LVMH chairman and chief executive officer Bernard Arnault told The New York Times that being part of a conglomerate could free Tiffany to “have a different state of mind.

“When you are an independent brand listed on the American stock exchange, your goal has to be the next quarter profit,” he said.

While LVMH is also a public company, it does not break out individual brands’ results.

Arnault added that Tiffany is “strong in the U.S. and Japan, but weak in Europe and not up to growth in China. There we can help a lot, find the best locations.”

Arnault told Reuters that Tiffany is “an American icon, which is now going to become a little French too.”

LVMH owns two other jewelers—Bulgari, which it acquired in 2011, and Fred—as well as three watch brands.

The deal still has to be approved by Tiffany’s shareholders. It is expected to close by the middle of 2020.

Arnault said in a statement, “We have an immense respect and admiration for Tiffany and intend to develop this jewel with the same dedication and commitment that we have applied to each and every one of our maisons. We will be proud to have Tiffany sit alongside our iconic brands and look forward to ensuring that Tiffany continues to thrive for centuries to come.”

Roger N. Farah, chairman of the Tiffany board of directors, said in the same statement, “Following a strategic review that included a thoughtful internal process and expert external advice, the board has concluded that this transaction with LVMH provides an exciting path forward with a group that appreciates and will invest in Tiffany’s unique assets and strong human capital, while delivering a compelling price with value certainty to our shareholders.”

Added Alessandro Bogliolo, Tiffany CEO: “As part of the LVMH group, Tiffany will reach new heights, capitalizing on its remarkable internal expertise, unparalleled craftsmanship, and strong cultural values.”

Tiffany has 321 stores in more than 20 countries. The brand has had an eclectic lineup of owners in its 182-year history, including General Shoe Co. and Avon Products. For years it had long been rumored to be takeover target, but past executives have generally said it should remain independent."
LVMH enters agreement to acquire Tiffany & Co for $16.2bn - Retail Insight Network,"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldGFpbC1pbnNpZ2h0LW5ldHdvcmsuY29tL25ld3MvbHZtaC1hY3F1aXJlcy10aWZmYW55LWNvL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LVMH enters agreement to acquire Tiffany & Co for $16.2bn.

Luxury group LVMH Moët Hennessy-Louis Vuitton has agreed to acquire American luxury jewellery and specialty retailer Tiffany & Co for $16.2bn or $135 per share in cash.

LVMH said it believes that the acquisition will boost its presence in the US and complement its 75 distinguished Houses.

Approved by the boards of directors of both companies, the deal is expected to close in the middle of next year, with Tiffany & Co added to LVMH’s Watches & Jewellery division.

Last month, Tiffany & Co confirmed the receipt of an unsolicited, non-binding proposal from LVMH. The proposal offered to acquire Tiffany for $120 per share in cash.

At the time, the retailer had revealed that the two parties were not in discussions. However, the retailer admitted that through its independent financial and legal advisors, it was carefully studying the proposal.

The transaction is dependent on customary closing conditions, approvals from Tiffany’s shareholders and regulatory.

Arnault family-owned LVMH buys Tiffany & Co for $16 billion - Campden FB,"Mon, 25 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbXBkZW5mYi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9hcm5hdWx0LWZhbWlseS1vd25lZC1sdm1oLWJ1eXMtdGlmZmFueS1jby0xNi1iaWxsaW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The French family behind the world’s largest luxury group LVMH has made its biggest ever acquisition by adding the US jewellery brand Tiffany & Co to its portfolio for an up-scaled offer of $16 billion.

The $51.5 billion (€46.8 billion) LVMH empire will acquire the $4.4 billion Tiffany for $135 per share in cash, in a transaction with an equity value of $16.2 billion (€14.7 billion). The luxury goods giant increased its offer from $120 per share last month.

Family principal Bernard Arnault (pictured below), chairman and chief executive, said the addition of Tiffany will transform LVMH’s watches and jewellery division and complement its portfolio of 75 brands. Its jewellery division includes Bulgari which LVMH bought for $5.2 billion (€3.7 billion) in 2011.

“We are delighted to have the opportunity to welcome Tiffany, a company with an unparalleled heritage and unique position in the global jewellery world, to the LVMH family,” Arnault said in a statement today.

“We have an immense respect and admiration for Tiffany and intend to develop this jewel with the same dedication and commitment that we have applied to each and every one of our Maisons.

“We will be proud to have Tiffany sit alongside our iconic brands and look forward to ensuring that Tiffany continues to thrive for centuries to come.”

Roger Farah (pictured bottom), chairman of Tiffany, said LVMH appreciates and will invest in Tiffany’s “unique assets and strong human capital, while delivering a compelling price with value certainty to our shareholders.”

LVMH has rapidly grown and entered into new markets through a series of acquisitions since Arnault, 70, took a majority stake in the new merger between Louis Vuitton and Moet Hennessey in 1988. Voracious dealmaking helped make Arnault the second richest person in the world in 2019, with a $107 billion fortune, second only to Jeff Bezos, of Amazon, according to Forbes.

The dogged pursuit of the 182-year-old Tiffany brand by the deep-pocketed LVMH may give European families behind the remaining independent businesses in the luxury market pause for reflection as their founding patriarchs and matriarchs enter their twilight years.

Groupe Arnault, the family office which controls LVMH, has a reputation for investing in technology startups in later stages. It joined forces with US-based private equity firm Catterton to launch a new global consumer-focused investment firm, L Catterton, in 2016. L Catterton said it has $20 billion of equity capital across seven fund strategies in 17 offices globally, dedicated to growing middle market companies and emerging high-growth enterprises.

Arnault’s four children—Delphine, Antoine, Alexandre and Frederic—work in the family business although his heir apparent is considered to be Alexandre. The 27-year-old has served as chief executive and president of Rimowa since the luggage brand was acquired by LVMH in 2017. He was the only next gen to accompany Bernard at the official opening, by US President Donald Trump, of the new Louis Vuitton Workshop Rochambeau factory in Texas last month."

Bernard Arnault, the French billionaire and head of luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, is closing in on the title of world’s richest person after his company agreed to purchase Tiffany & Company in a $16 billion deal on Monday.

The 70-year-old businessman — who serves as chairman of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, indisputably the world’s largest luxury company — is now worth $106.8 billion, according to Forbes.

Arnault’s net worth rose by 1 percent after the takeover of the iconic American company was announced. Tiffany was made a household name by the 1961 Audrey Hepburn film, Breakfast at Tiffany’s, based on the novel by Truman Capote.

LVMH — of which Arnault and his family own more than 47%, per CNN — now claims more than 70 luxury brands under its umbrella, including Christian Dior, Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Celine, Bulgari, Hublot, TAG Heuer, and Dom Perignon champagne, according to Fortune.

The purchase places Arnault just (billions) shy of the two wealthiest people in the world, Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

Forbe’s “Real-Time Billionaires List,” which tracks the net worth of the richest people in the world, placed Gates at $107 billion and Bezos at $110.2 billion on Monday. Warren Buffet, Mark Zuckerberg and Larry Ellison round out the top six wealthiest people.

According to the New York Times, Arnault first began his accumulation of companies in the 1980s, when he purchased a bankrupt French textile company called Boussac. He sold most of the company but kept one piece, Dior, and expanded it.

The newspaper says Arnault has a reputation for being extremely competitive and wanted to own the top luxury company when he realized he couldn’t be No. 1 in his two other passions, piano and tennis.

He has two children from his first marriage, and three from his second. Four of them work for various brands owned by LVMH."
