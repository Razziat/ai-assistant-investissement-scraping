Antoine Arnault: prince of luxury - The Guardian,"Sun, 28 Oct 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS90aGVvYnNlcnZlci8yMDEyL29jdC8yOC9hbnRvaW5lLWFybmF1bHQtbHZtaC1iZXJsdXRpLWZhc2hpb27SAVhodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vdGhlb2JzZXJ2ZXIvMjAxMi9vY3QvMjgvYW50b2luZS1hcm5hdWx0LWx2bWgtYmVybHV0aS1mYXNoaW9u?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"At the end of a dinner created by triple Michelin-starred chef Yannick Alléno, served to a table of 100 against the surreal backdrop of Harrods menswear department, a young man rises to speak to the assembled guests. His audience, which includes supermodels David Gandy and Eva Herzigova, gallerist Jay Jopling as well as artist Dinos Chapman and editors Jefferson Hack and Suzy Menkes, have gathered to celebrate the relaunch of Berluti as a major luxury menswear brand. The French leather goods label is 127 years old, but the CEO who stands before us is 35.

His face is rounder, his fringe is floppier and he is, of course, much younger than you'd imagine a CEO to be. But the room falls silent as he recounts an anecdote about his first Berluti shoes, which his father gave to him when he was 17. He was going through a rebellious phase, ""listening to Nirvana"", so he barely wore them. But he kept them, quietly proud to own something so beautiful. Now the father who gave him those shoes has put him in charge of the brand. He says he's determined to honour that idea of an heirloom. He promises that he will never compromise on the quality. The room applauds and the waiters surge forward to fill glasses with Château d'Yquem Sauternes 2006. I slip away, and finally manage to get a cab when Bryan Ferry relinquishes his so I can get home.

I want an early(ish) night because I'm meeting Antoine Arnault, CEO of Berluti, at 9am the next day at Hotel Bulgari in Knightsbridge. The Arnaults, who hail from Roubaix in northern France, are the most influential family in global fashion. Their holdings company, Groupe Arnault, is the majority shareholder in Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA – better known as LVMH, the luxury goods conglomerate which runs Givenchy, Marc Jacobs, Donna Karan, Fendi, Veuve Clicquot, Tag Heuer and Guerlain to name but a few of the 60-plus brands that fall under its grand umbrella. The father he talked about so fondly last night is Bernard Arnault, according to Forbes magazine the fourth richest person in the world, with a net worth of $41bn. Bernard's empire started with Christian Dior, acquired in 1984, and has grown through aggressive expansion and inspired hiring (he is the man who pulled designers such as Marc Jacobs, John Galliano and Alexander McQueen on to the international stage) to become the largest luxury-goods group in the world. Sales are expected to hit $33bn this year.

Antoine's older sister, Delphine, also works in the business. Having started at the smaller fashion labels Loewe and Pucci, she is now a director at Dior. Antoine started in the advertising department at Louis Vuitton and worked his way up to head of communications before becoming CEO at Berluti. He's also on the board of LVMH. Although the pair have three much younger siblings (from Bernard's second marriage to Hélène Mercier, a Canadian concert pianist), at the moment it looks likely that one of them will become Bernard's heir apparent. ""We work hard,"" says Antoine. ""We were raised with real values about the importance of work and respect for the people. We're not in the gossip magazines playing strip billiards."" Unlike Prince Harry, when Antoine goes to Vegas it's for poker – he's a world-class player. He dates a supermodel, but his relationship with Natalia Vodianova is very stable. The couple have just finished doing up their house in France.

Normally it would be hard to imagine what Antoine's level of wealth feels like, but in the last 24 hours I've had a reasonable insight into his world. The Berluti party was catered by Alléno, a chef who works at Cheval Blanc Courchevel, a French five-star hotel owned by LVMH, which Arnault assured me is absolutely lovely. We were served £300-a-bottle wine from Château d'Yquem – the 14th-century vineyard is LVMH's oldest brand – and this morning we're in a suite at Hotel Bulgari which is, of course, five star, and, of course, owned by LVMH. ""It's very nice, no?"" says Arnault walking around the suite's living room. His enthusiasm when he talks about the hotels, last night's menu and how much he enjoyed the party feels completely genuine. He pauses to inspect a classic Arco floor lamp next to the sofa. ""I think this used to be mine, I'm sure I had it in my office, but I got a little bored of it…"" He wanders off to greet Alessandro Sartori, Berluti's creative director.

It is, of course, very easy to dismiss Arnault's appointment as nepotism. Bernard Arnault comes from a culture of family business (before he moved into fashion, he was the third generation of Arnaults to work in a real-estate business founded by his grandfather). But an empire like LVMH isn't built by doing family favours. And, although Berluti – a well-established brand with devoted customers – at first glance seems like an easy ride, it's a crucial development for the conglomerate and a huge amount of money has been invested in the project. LVMH's success is too dependant on Louis Vuitton: the fashion house brings in 37% of the group's sales. At some point sales will surely slow – to continue growth, LVMH has to diversify. The luxury menswear sector is currently one of the hottest growth areas in fashion, so relaunching Berluti as a clothing and lifestyle brand is a big deal, a potentially vital diversification. ""It's a good appointment for Berluti,"" says Honor Westnedge, a retail analyst at Verdict Research. ""It's not a well-known brand in America or the UK, so Antoine's background in marketing and communication gives him the perfect qualifications to refresh the brand and introduce it to new customers."" Arnault's little anecdote about his first Berlutis may have been a nice soundbite for last night's dinner, but he clearly understand the brand's potential value.

""Berluti was untouched,"" he explains. ""LVMH bought it in the 1990s and it was one of the few brands that felt like an almost divine name, quite untouchable – and that's where you want a brand to be, in luxury it has to feel almost inaccessible. A pair of Berluti shoes has this flair, these nuances in colour and patina, so I thought: 'What if we took this je ne sais quoi and turn it into a menswear brand?' Also, we are not poets, huh? We're businessmen. We know this is a segment of the market which lacks a real good player, a house that allies to authenticity and tradition, but with style and sophistication. It's usually either or.""

The Berluti menswear collection created by Alessandro Sartori, who Arnault headhunted from Italian menswear label Z Zegna, launched this autumn and is certainly sophisticated. It's the epitome of how to create modern ultra-luxury. The clothes and leather goods have no logo – the range's only signature is a stitched slash, so only those in the know will recognise the brand. The clothes – in shades of slate, navy, mahogany – are heavy on silk, cashmere, double cashmere. The prices are just as remarkable. Shoes come relatively cheap, starting at £980, but you could spend more than £22,000 on a crocodile-skin bag. Cashmere coats start at £3,300. Obviously it's between you, your god and your bank manager whether you think paying these prices is obscene, an aspiration or something you do most weekends, but there's undeniably an international market for this level of luxury goods.

""It's an expensive pair of shoes,"" concedes Arnault. ""It's £1,000. Why do people spend that on shoes? Well, for them it's not just shoes, it's a lifestyle, it's a message to the people around you. I think the LVMH portfolio has done well during this economic crisis because we make things right, we don't cheat. It's not indecent that these brands grow, it's because our customers think they're buying an asset, not a product.""

The prices may be elitist, but Arnault is adamant that the brand should be egalitarian. ""I think buying shoes is intimidating for a guy. Sitting down taking your shoes off, for men, it's too much. But you should never be intimidated by anything. If I see one of my sales assistants neglecting someone because he doesn't look like a good client, he's fired immediately. I hate it when those guys are pricks and don't say hello. Not least because it's a terrible mistake.

""I remember a while ago at the Venice Biennale, there was a beautiful Brancusi statue in one of the galleries and everyone had to wait to see it. This guy turned up and they told him to get a ticket and come back later. So the guy leaves, goes to the next stand and buys three Picassos – because it was Bill Gates. If that was the way it was for Gates, imagine how intimidating it would be for a regular guy to see the Brancusi. That's how I don't want things to be in my company. Because even if you can't buy, you're going to see beautiful products here – and one day when you can buy, well, we'll still be here.""

If you ever do want to spend significant money on luxury goods, if it isn't Arnault's brand you spend it with, well, it will probably be one that his family owns. Antoine says that fashion has always been part of his life and that he thinks his immersion in the market gives him a significant advantage.

""I was taught fashion very early, from the age of 12 when my father bought and created the group. We spent all our weekends in stores, speaking about brands, discussing advertising – I remember watching the adverts for [top-selling Dior perfumes] Poison, for Dolce Vita… is the music right? The edit? I had a couple of rebellious years when I didn't want to be bothered with it, but I very naturally came back to it. It's not a burden, you know? You're going to work in fashion, surrounded by creativity and beautiful people, beautiful objects – or work in banking. Well, you know… OK, I choose fashion. It was really a road that I was happy to drive down. The fact that we were initiated into it very early gave me and my sister Delphine a headstart. We feel things, brands, streets, we know where it's going to happen maybe a tiny bit before the others, so we use that.""

Arnault thinks the most important thing he has learnt from his father is the ability to communicate with designers properly – and that this is a key skill in the fashion business. ""I'm sorry, but designers are not artists. They may have the talent of one, but if they want to work in that way they should paint or sculpt. Here they're working in business and they need a brief. That's what my father does so well. I've witnessed him do it countless times and I'm really inspired by that. You know, towards the end, my father just couldn't talk to John Galliano at all, it was impossible – he wouldn't listen to anything. At that point, it crashes.""

I wonder if it's hard to work for his father – it must add an extra level of stress to performing well at work. He laughs heartily. ""Of course there's pressure, but I deserve absolutely no pity. It's a great life and a great job. It didn't arrive just like that"" – he snaps his fingers – ""I work hard and, yes, my father trusts me more and more and we're more involved in business decisions, but please don't feel sorry for me.""

I promise him, hand on heart, that I won't – which makes him laugh even more.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999068975448608}",neutral,0.9999068975448608,0
Harry Winston might sell the family jewels - New York Post,"Thu, 18 Oct 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDEyLzEwLzE4L2hhcnJ5LXdpbnN0b24tbWlnaHQtc2VsbC10aGUtZmFtaWx5LWpld2Vscy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Harry Winston is the marrying kind.

Shares of the fabled diamond merchant soared as much as 11 percent yesterday on reports it was in talks to sell its chain of swanky stores.

Harry Winston shares gained 4.7 percent to close at $14.18 after Reuters reported that the company had approached European luxury giants LVMH and PPR about a possible sale.

Sources told The Post that Harry Winston, famous for its baubles with six- and seven-digit price tags, has been approached by prospective suitors throughout the past year.

The pricey brand — made famous in the 1950s when Marilyn Monroe referred to it in the song “Diamonds Are A Girl’s Best Friend” — hadn’t actively approached potential bidders as of this summer, said one person close to the situation.

French conglomerate PPR owns the jeweler Boucheron but has signaled it is looking to bulk up its jewelry holdings. Likewise, LVMH is said to be interested in expanding its jewelry investments even after acquiring Bulgari last year.

Insiders said Chairman Bob Gannicott — who merged Harry Winston in 2004 with his Canadian mining company in a deal valued at $284 million — is considering selling the Harry Winston brand to raise capital as he weighs the purchase of other big diamond mines.

Selling the Harry Winston brand could be lucrative, as it has since multiplied in value by expanding its chain worldwide, giving the company a market capitalization of $1.2 billion.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998341798782349}",neutral,0.9998341798782349,0
Few knew of big embezzlement in Yeosu - 코리아타임스,"Sat, 27 Oct 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhdGltZXMuY28ua3Ivd3d3L25hdGlvbi8yMDI0LzAzLzExM18xMjMyNTUuaHRtbNIBP2h0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYXRpbWVzLmNvLmtyL3BhZ2VzL2FydGljbGUuYW1wLmFzcD9uZXdzSWR4PTEyMzI1NQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Kim Bo-eun



Citizens in Yeosu, a port city in South Jeolla Province, are reeling over reports that a low-ranking public official embezzled billions of won in taxpayers' money.



The local government said Friday the official, identified as 47-year-old Kim, was indicted for embezzling some 7 billion won. The final amount could be even higher as more money is being found to have been taken as the investigation proceeds.



The investigation follows an attempted suicide by Kim and his wife. Kim was found unconscious in his car with his wife on a road in Yeosu on Oct. 8. Burning briquettes and sleeping pills were found inside his car at the time. He was indicted a week later on Oct. 15.



Kim had been in charge of expenditure in the accounting bureau at Yeosu City Hall. He overstated the amount of tax to be paid and pocketed the difference. He also misappropriated funds by inflating expenses for the issuance of gift certificates.



The case prompted Yeosu Mayor Kim Chung-seog to issue a public apology Monday.



""I sincerely apologize as Yeosu mayor for having disappointed citizens and causing concern,"" he said.



""We will do the best we can to prevent such an incident from happening again and will take appropriate measures against those responsible.""



Recent investigations showed Kim received the wages of employees who retired or transferred to other workplaces through creating accounts under their names.



He embezzled money for three years but his activities went unnoticed until an on-site audit took place.



Kim discarded related financial documents to try and hide his crimes.



""The Board of Audit and Inspection had requested related documents during the inspection but nobody could find them,"" said a city official. ""It seems that Kim had done away with the documents that could get him into trouble.""



Kim was found to have bought apartments for relatives and also engaged in private loan activities.



Investigators are focusing on identifying the exact amount that Kim has misappropriated.

It ain’t the first, and won’t most certainly be the last. Versace, Christian Lacroix, Armani, Bulgari… what’s common to these fashion houses is their penchant for real estate investment, particularly owning luxury resorts and hotels that draw a million patrons through the year.

Adding to its impressive portfolio, what with White 1921 in St Tropez, and Cheval Blanc Courchevel in the French Alps, Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy (LVMH) is all set to lift the curtains on its latest resort hotel in the Maldives. While White 1921 boasted of eight suites with distinct individualistic interiors by Jean-Michael Wilmotte, this new kid on the block is all set to make a splash with 46 luxury villas on the island of Randheli in Noonu Atoll.

According to AFP, the hotel will house ‘Le 1947′ restaurant, serving up classic Alpine dishes with a modern twist by three-star Michelin chef Yannick Alléno. Slated for a 2013 opening, the resort will host an in-house Christian Dior boutique and expectedly, a Louis Vuitton shop.

With Missoni expanding through Oman, Turkey, Brazil and Mauritius, and Bulgari’s 2015 Shanghai venture, Louis Vuitton’s announcement only reinforces the ongoing trend.
