New Delhi: French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH ’s investment arm L Catterton Asia has acquired majority stake in restaurateur Riyaaz Amlani ’s Impresario Entertainment & Hospitality, promoter of fine dining restaurant brands Smoke House Deli and Social.Two persons familiar with the development said the deal values Impresario at about Rs 500 crore.“The deal has been structured with primary infusion of capital and a secondary share sale. The latter involves existing investors exiting the company or diluting their stakes,” another person briefed about the development said.Confirming the development, L Catterton Asia managing partner Ravi Thakran said, “We are delighted to partner with Riyaaz Amlani and Impresario Restaurants to build Social and Smoke House Deli into iconic food and beverage brands both in India and abroad.” He declined to confirm the deal size.EThad first reported in June that the LVMH arm is likely to buy a stake in Impresario. The investment comes at a time when the eating out sector in the country is looking up as a long-term high potential business after two years of subdued sales.Prior to the deal with L Catterton, Amlani owned about 30% of Impresario, while PE investor Beacon India Investors held 36% and restaurant player Mirah Hospitality owned 16%. The remaining stake is split among other smaller investors.According to persons cited earlier, Amlani’s shareholding will come down to 20-25% after the deal with L Catterton.“Riyaaz will remain a significant minority and he will continue to head operations,” one of them said.Amlani said he is “thrilled” to partner with L Catterton that “specialises in consumer investing worldwide and have had significant experience and success building F&B brands such as Crystal Jade, Ce La Vi and Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen”.L Catterton Asia was earlier known as L Capital Asia. Last year, L Capital merged with US-based private equity firm Catterton to form L Catterton.L Catterton had earlier invested in Indian consumeroriented firms such as Fabindia, Genesis Luxury and PVR.Two years ago, it made a bountiful harvest when it exited PVR by selling its 15% stake in an open market transaction on the National Stock Exchange for about Rs 485 crore.Recent PE investments in the Indian restaurant space include Gaja Capital’s .Rs 160-crore investment in Jiggs and Zorawar Kalra’s Massive Restaurants.Real estate developer Embassy Group’s managing director Jitendra Virwani recently bought controlling stake in JSM Corporation, which operates restaurant brands Hard Rock Cafe, California Pizza Kitchen and Shiro.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999943971633911}",neutral,0.9999943971633911,0
CONFIRMED: Phoebe Philo is Leaving Céline - The Fashion Law,"Fri, 22 Dec 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZhc2hpb25sYXcuY29tL3Bob2ViZS1waGlsby1pcy1sZWF2aW5nLWNsaW5lL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Phoebe Philo is leaving Céline after a 10 year tenure with the Paris-based brand. As WWD reported on Friday and further confirmed by LVMH, Céline’s Fall/Winter 2018 collection, which will be presented in March, will be the last collection crafted by the designer. WWD states that Philo — who took a two-year hiatus between her time at Chloé and Céline — will not work for another label in the near future and her successor to the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton-owned house will be named in the coming months.

In a statement seen by WWD, the designer thanked her teams, saying: “Working with Céline has been an exceptional experience for me these last 10 years. I am grateful to have worked with an incredibly talented and committed team and I would like to thank everyone along the way who has been part of the collaborations and conversations … it’s been amazing.”

The news comes on the heels of ever-lingering reports that Philo would depart the house, and as recently as October, it was revealed that LVMH was looking to fill the soon-to-be vacant creative director position at Céline, one of its buzziest brands (thanks to Philo), as Philo was looking for an out, potentially to take the helm at Burberry next year, where its current creative director Christopher Bailey announced he will leave in late 2018.

During her tenure at Céline, which began in 2008, Philo has helped turn the Paris-based brand from a quiet label to a highly in-demand source for garments and accessories, as well as inspiration for fast fashion brands and fellow high fashion labels, as well. As Vogue put it, “Philo remade Céline as the label for unfussy, minimally chic, professional women. You could tell a Céline customer from miles away from the just-so cut of a trench or the bag hung over her arm. During Philo’s tenure, Céline has had not one, but many hit bags—successes from the much-copied Luggage tote to the multi-pocket Trio to the oversize Cabas.”

Philo is leaving the brand at an interesting time. After holding out for years, while other brand were working to adopt an array of digitally-focused marketing and sales tactics, Céline recently, under the direction of new CEO Séverine Merle (who, as of April 1, replaced Marco Gobbetti now serves as the CEO of Burberry), adopted an array of new measures, including the launch of an e-comemrce site (the first shoppable website for the brand) and an Instagram presence.

While online sales have become the fashion industry’s most important and promising engine of growth, Céline was one of the final hold-outs in terms of e-commerce and social media. Philo, herself, who does not maintain any personal social media accounts, has long been opposed to the concept, saying several years ago that “the chicest thing is when you don’t exist on Google.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999847412109375}",neutral,0.999847412109375,0

Dominique Muret Translated by

Nicola Mira Published

Dec 1, 2017

On Monday, the group started its first Italian professional training programme in Florence, where it established a branch of the Institut des Métiers d’Excellence (IME), its vocational training institute. On this occasion, the French luxury group's Director for Human Resources and Synergies, Chantal Gaemperle, spoke to about the new needs of the luxury goods industry.







Chantal Gaemperle, Director for Human Resources and Synergies at LVMH - LVMH



FashionNetwork.com: Did you identify a shortage of certain professional skills, something which encouraged you to set up your vocational training programmes?



Chantal Gaemperle: Indeed, this is the reasoning behind our approach. But it isn't so simple. It all stems from a need we are trying to anticipate. However, when you're talking about human resource development, it takes time. We are convinced that the right man or woman makes all the difference. Through their work, our crafts people transmit not just the quality of their expertise, but also their pride in creating fine products. This sense of pride, of excellence, is something you then find everywhere. It's something essential nowadays, the level of the customers' expectations being so high.

FNW: Why is this kind of professional training so important for a group like LVMH?



CG: Our training is a way of passing on our expertise, of preserving crafts which risk being lost, and of educating craftsmen to deliver excellence. There are other elements too. There are many crafts that people aren't aware of. This kind of education allows young people to discover the richness these crafts possess and, for us, it can help unearth and nurture the passion in young apprentices.



FNW: Crafts people are at the heart of [luxury] products, and of the industry at large. What wage policy do you adopt for them?



CG: I believe we are a responsible employer. But before we talk about salary, we must stress we are offering a future to young people who don't have any. We give them a qualification which allows them to become independent. The latest promotion for the IME shows a 96% success rate, and 90% of our trainees have found a job, 65% of them within LVMH or its partners.



FNW: The training programme you have recently launched in Italy is dedicated to leather goods and jewellery, and will extend to footwear and sales. Nowadays, how important are salespeople for a luxury group?



CG: It is an essential profession. One of our challenges is to better explain the future of distribution and retailing. The competitive environment has become tougher, and in-store experience is increasingly necessary, hence the importance of offering top-notch training in the subject. We have already launched a sales course in Paris, and we will set one up in Italy too. We would also like to create a community for the retail [professions] within the group, as we have already done for example by creating a network of women, or at the regional level, as a way to encourage the sharing of experiences.



FNW: In today's digital environment, is tech expertise a factor in your hiring policies?



CG: Yes, of course, technology has become a very important factor. But the role played by technology mustn't eclipse the human dimension.



FNW: How have the professional profiles you are searching for changed in the last few years?



CG: We are experiencing major transformations and a high degree of uncertainty. We therefore look for people who are able to manage uncertainty and change. Working in the luxury industry means accepting unpredictability. This means embracing the uncertainty and ambiguity of things, because we are part of a creative process. The world of luxury is full of paradoxes and tensions. On the one hand, there is craftsmanship, expertise and tradition. On the other, worldwide transformations. We are looking for individuals who see in these tensions a challenge that motivates them.

LVMH-Backed Fashion House Plans USD495 Million Shanghai IPO - Yicai Global,"Thu, 28 Dec 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlpY2FpZ2xvYmFsLmNvbS9uZXdzL2x2bWgtYmFja2VkLWZhc2hpb24taG91c2UtcGxhbnMtdXNkNDk1LW1pbGxpb24tc2hhbmdoYWktaXBv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Yicai Global) Dec. 28 -- Trendy Group Co., a Chinese fashion house backed by international fashion giant LVMH, has set its sights on raising CNY3.24 billion (USD495 million) in an initial public offerings of shares in Shanghai.

The funds will be used to open new stores among other investment areas, the Guangzhou-based company said in a statement.



L' Capital Asia, a subsidiary investment fund platform of France's LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE [EPA:MC], bought a minority stake in Trendy for nearly USD200 million in 2012, making it the fashion conglomerate's third-largest shareholder.

Trendy has several well-known fashion brands in China, including Ochirly and Trendiano. In recent years, it has acquired Italy's Sixty Group, owner of Miss Sixty and Energie, and the China rights for Britain's SuperGroup Plc's Superdry brand and Dutch brand Denham through a joint venture.

Trendy had net profit of about CNY1.1 billion on revenue of CNY6.4 billion in 2016. Though the group has established a diversified brand structure, most of its earnings still come from its core brand Ochirly, the profits of which accounted for over 45 percent of total group revenue in the first half of this year.

Louis Vuitton Turns to Facebook Bot to Chat Up Customers Online - The Business of Fashion,"Wed, 06 Dec 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL25ld3MtYW5hbHlzaXMvbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi10dXJucy10by1mYWNlYm9vay1ib3QtdG8tY2hhdC11cC1jdXN0b21lcnMtb25saW5lL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — Louis Vuitton is bringing in some robotic help for the holidays.

The maker of $1,370 canvas duffle bags and $575 monogram belts has launched a “virtual adviser” on Facebook Messenger for US clients, Palo Alto, California-based AI startup Mode.ai said in a statement Wednesday. The chatbot will answer queries for all things Louis Vuitton: searching the brand’s online catalog, pulling up catwalk shows and history about the brand, and giving tips for product maintenance.

The move comes as owner LVMH, whose products also include Christian Dior perfumes and Dom Perignon Champagne, accelerates its efforts to bring its luxury goods empire into the digital age. This year the company launched multibrand e-commerce sites for both its fashion and beverage divisions, while Louis Vuitton rolled out its first e-commerce site in China. The brand also introduced its first smartwatch, the $2,450 Tambour Horizon.

“Our clients like to be connected to the Louis Vuitton universe wherever they are,” the leather good brand’s chief executive officer, Michael Burke, said in the statement.

It has long been common practice for retailers to bring in extra staff to make the most of the holiday rush. In recent years, high end brands like trench coat maker Burberry Group Plc, perfumer Estee Lauder Cos. and watchmaker Richemont’s Jaeger-LeCoultre have also looked to boost their sales force by a more elastic means — enhancing their social media presence with chatbots that can talk to thousands of consumers at once.

Facebook Inc. has encouraged retailers to develop chatbots as part of the company’s strategy of keeping users on its own site and applications, not navigating away to seek services and information from other companies.

“We are still in the very early stages of AI technology adoption in the retail industry,” said Eitan Sharon, chief executive officer of Mode.ai, which developed the bot for Vuitton. Sharon said he expects more companies to turn to AI as clients demand a more personalised online shopping experience.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996041655540466}",neutral,0.9996041655540466,0
"With Phoebe Philo Leaving Céline, What's Next? - The Business of Fashion","Fri, 22 Dec 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9uZXdzLWFuYWx5c2lzL3Bob2ViZS1waGlsby1pcy1vZmZpY2lhbGx5LWxlYXZpbmctY2VsaW5lL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, France — Céline creative director Phoebe Philo has informed her team that she is leaving the house after its Autumn 2018 presentation, confirming BoF's October report that first revealed Philo was exiting the company.

“Working with Céline has been an exceptional experience for me these last 10 years,” said Philo in a statement. “I am grateful to have worked with an incredibly talented and committed team and I would like to thank everyone along the way who has been a part of the collaborations and conversations… it’s been amazing.”

Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive of LVMH, Céline's parent company, said: ""What Phoebe has accomplished over the past 10 years represents a key chapter in the history of Céline. We are very grateful to Phoebe for having contributed to the great momentum of this maison. A new era of development for Céline will now start and I am extremely confident in the future success of this iconic maison.""

Philo, who first caught the eye of the industry at Chloé in the early 2000s, joined Céline in 2008 after a three-year hiatus spent focusing on her family. She turned the once-middling label into a fashion authority with her minimalist designs, known for their emphasis on tailoring, menswear-inspired staples and quietly dramatic silhouettes. Philo was behind many of Céline's hit bags, including the Phantom, Trapeze and Trio.

The label's inspired visual identity — from Juergen Teller-lensed campaigns and an updated Semplicità-font logo to the use of now-ubiquitous philodendrons (more casually referred to as a ""cheese plant"") — has influenced fashion, but also the greater advertising industry as well as home design.

Over the past decade, she helped lift Céline's annual sales from €200 million (about $236 million at current exchange) to more than €700 million ($828 million), according to analysts. (LVMH does not break out figures for the label.) The London-born designer won British Designer of the Year at the British Fashion Awards in 2010 for the second time. In 2011, she received the International Award at the CFDA Fashion Awards.

But if Céline is one of LVMH's most successful fashion brands, under Philo, one of fashion's last techno-refuseniks, it has also been a digital laggard. The label only launched an Instagram account earlier this year, long after competitors. In November, it launched its first presence on WeChat.

And at a time when e-commerce is one of the most significant growth opportunities in a slow luxury market — over the next 10 years, McKinsey & Company expects the share of luxury sales occurring online to triple, making e-commerce the world's third largest luxury market after China and the US — Céline only recently embraced online sales.

The brand finally launched e-commerce in France in December as part of a shift put in place by new chief executive Séverine Merle, who arrived in April, replacing Marco Gobbetti, who left to take the helm at British megabrand Burberry. Previously, Merle was the deputy of Berluti chief executive Antoine Arnault and, before that, general director of Louis Vuitton France. Céline's digital growth is expected to accelerate in the wake of Philo's departure, as the label rolls out e-commerce sites in the rest of Europe and the US in 2018 and Japan in 2019.

Yet despite her reticence to embrace modern retail conventions — or perhaps, in part, because of it — Philo's influence on the industry dwarf's the scale of Céline's actual business. That influence reaches all the way back to the late 1990s, when Philo studied with Stella McCartney at Central Saint Martins, following the now-brand-name designer when she took the creative director job from Karl Lagerfeld at Chloé in 1997. When McCartney left Chloé to set up her own fashion label in a joint-venture with what was then called the Gucci Group, now part of the conglomerate Kering, Philo was left out of the project. Chloé's chief executive at the time, Ralph Toledano, exploited the rift to place Philo in the top job in 2001.

The designer's seminal years at Chloé, where she remained until 2006, were marked by commercial success. Philo introduced a whole new vocabulary to the style vernacular: high-waisted wide-leg trousers and jeans, gauzy bib-front blouses, chunky heels and wedge shoes, oblong leather bags with purposeful hardware and Grecian-style dresses with rustic accessories. Chloé's “Paddington"" bag was one of the most successful “It” bags of the era — one of the 8,000 made in spring 2005 was spoken for before it reached the stores.

Philo's ability to simply make things women want was at the core of her success both at Chloé and later at Céline.

ADVERTISEMENT

""I just wanted to make a pair of trousers that made my arse look good, rather than a pair that represented the Holocaust or something,"" she told the Guardian in 2009, adding that her relationship with fashion is playful and expressive of what she's feeling at the time. ""For a while I thought, maybe this is some kind of lack of me knowing myself. But then I realised I was being true to myself, because I knew what I felt.""

Philo's knack for setting the aesthetic agenda is envied by designers and coveted by executives, making her one of the most sought-after talents in the industry. ""I think she would be perfect for Chanel or Bottega Veneta,"" says Luca Solca, head of luxury goods at Exane BNP Paribas. ""Phoebe has proven to be exceptionally talented when it comes to creating blockbuster high-end handbag styles. With their icons seemingly tired, both Chanel and Bottega Veneta would need that capability.""

But market sources say Philo has no plans to move immediately to another house and may simply take a break from fashion. Rumours that she could join her former chief executive Marco Gobbetti at Burberry when chief creative officer Christopher Bailey departs at the end of March 2018 appear unfounded.

As for LVMH's plans for Céline: the brand still has plenty of room to grow, and Philo's design team will continue to produce collections while the search for a replacement is completed. Names that have surfaced include Simon Porte Jacquemus and Proenza Schouler's Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez, as well as former Stella McCartney design director Natasa Cagalj, who is now at Ports 1961, and Ilaria Icardi, the design director at Victoria Beckham. Whomever succeeds Philo will be challenged to contend with the designer's legacy, imprinted on the house of Céline for a decade, an admirably long tenure in an era of brisk designer turnover.

L Catterton Acquires Majority Stake in Ganni - The Business of Fashion,"Thu, 14 Dec 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzb2ZmYXNoaW9uLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9maW5hbmNlL2wtY2F0dGVydG9uLWFjcXVpcmVzLW1ham9yaXR5LXN0YWtlLWluLWdhbm5pL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ganni, the Danish mid-market label beloved by influencers and editors alike, is going global with the help of a top-tier strategic partner. L Catterton, the consumer-focused private equity firm whose shareholders include LVMH and Groupe Arnault, the family holding company of LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault, has acquired a 51 percent stake in the brand. The terms of the transaction were undisclosed.

“I felt we had taken Ganni to a point where we needed to look for a partner, and that would be someone who would take what we are good at and try to leverage that on an international scale,” said Ganni chief executive Nicolaj Reffstrup. “Trying to build an international brand out of Copenhagen is pretty tough… We are at a certain size where it doesn’t make sense to look for basic capital or minority investment; we needed a partner.”

Ganni was founded by Frans Truelsen in 2000. Reffstrup and his wife Ditte, Ganni’s creative director, took control of the brand in 2009 when it was a mostly cashmere line turning over about 1 million euros per year and transformed it into a trendy label known for its sweet-spot pricing and playful mash-up of styles, trends and colours. The brand will generate around $45 million in sales in 2017 and expects revenues to grow by 50 percent in 2018.

Instagram has been key to Ganni’s success. While the brand has a small following by international standards — 313,000 followers — its Danish model and It-girl fan base has a wide and influential reach. “It’s a very relevant group of followers and a lot of them feel that this ‘Ganni Girl’ concept resonates well with them,” said Reffstrup, referring to the #GanniGirls hashtag coined for the label’s followers by model Helena Christensen in 2015.

In L Catterton, Ganni has found an experienced partner that will help it expand in Europe, the United States and Asia. The private equity firm has invested in Gentle Monster, Gant, SMCP (Sandro Maje Claudie Pierlot) and Giuseppe Zanotti, among other fashion brands.

“They have unique knowledge of how to build global super brand,” said Reffstrup, adding that the firm's links to the LVMH Group and Groupe Arnault will also be valuable. “Quite frankly, we left a lot of money on the table because we wanted to go with the right partner, rather than the best price point.”

Moving forward, Reffstrup said Ganni will continue to take a “multi-dimensional” approach to growth, opening stores at a “moderate pace” of 5 to 6 locations per year. The label currently has 21 of its own stores in Scandinavia, as well as a thriving e-commerce business and a wholesale network of over 400 doors. “We are still in many ways a niche brand,” he said. “The US is definitely a priority because we sense that the brand resonates extremely well with the market.”

“Ganni has already established its strong international appeal, as demonstrated by its retail presence in 20 countries today,” wrote Eduardo Velasco, partner at L Catterton, over e-mail. “But the brand’s digitally driven strategy and strong e-commerce platform makes its potential for global growth even more exciting… With local offices around the globe, we are also able to provide on-the-ground operational expertise to help support and tailor the brand’s strategies in specific local markets.”

Culling its stockists is key to Ganni's strategy, too. This season, Reffstrup says Ganni will drop about 100 wholesale accounts— including one he declined to name that represented 10 percent of total sales — because it no longer provided the right brand adjacencies. With prices ranging from $50 for a t-shirt to over $2,000 for outerwear and wide-ranging collections covering dresses, knitwear shoes and lingerie, Ganni is often more accessibly-priced than other brands available at its wholesale partners. Its key partners include Net-a-Porter, Browns and Selfridges, in addition to independent boutiques such as Uzwei in Hamburg, Elise Walker in Los Angeles, Boutique 1 in Dubai and London and Theresa in Munich.

Wholesale currently accounts for two-thirds of Ganni’s sales. “The longterm plan is to balance that out,” says Reffstrup. “We do not expect to grow aggressively over the years. We are going to slow down slightly relative to our size.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Ganni will also benefit from L Catterton’s merchandising expertise. “We are not born retailers,” explained Reffstrup. “There is a lot that they can teach us about increasing the units per transaction by putting together a better merchandise offering.”

While Ganni plans to open new offices in London and New York, the company will remain headquartered in Copenhagen, its spiritual home, known for the mix-and-match style that has been a key inspiration. Pursuing scale while retaining Ganni's unique brand DNA, therefore, is a balancing act that Reffstrup knows is a challenge: “We only have very few examples of fashion companies [here] that have grown to a certain size.”

“As with any rapidly growing global brand, the key is effectively managing that growth and preserve the brand’s strong foundation,” added Velasco via email. “As Ganni continues to successfully expand in new and existing markets, L Catterton will ensure the team has the tools to maintain the high quality, contemporary style and fantastic customer experience that Ganni’s customers have come to love.”

However, as the son of LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault, the 25-year-old already has more business experience than most mid-twenty-somethings. As the CEO of luggage label RIMOWA, Arnault has focused on expanding the brand’s global reach and making it equally desirable as other LVMH lines. At the new RIMOWA pop-up in Los Angeles, he discussed the brand’s next moves.

On the topic of the brand’s old stores — its LA branch is currently undergoing renovation — Arnault explained, “We want to modernize our stores and make them more — it’s going to sound like every other brand — but more experiential.” In that vein, Arnault aims to continue opening RIMOWA pop-ups; “Pop-ups are very exciting because they allow you to test things that you can’t do in more permanent places, and then I think also it’s a cool way to … launch new products, to launch new collections.” The brand also aims to become a one-stop-shop for travelers: the pop-up offers pressed juice, fashion magazines and essential goods like pens. Furthermore, RIMOWA is integrating technology into its suitcases to allow for more ease on the road, like an electronic tag feature that allows users to digitally display their luggage tag on the case instead of having to print one out.

"Phoebe Philo, the world's leading feminist fashion designer, is stepping down from Céline - Quartz","Fri, 22 Dec 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vcXouY29tL3F1YXJ0enkvMTE2NDM0NS9jZWxpbmVzLXBob2ViZS1waGlsby10aGUtd29ybGRzLWxlYWRpbmctZmVtaW5pc3QtZmFzaGlvbi1kZXNpZ25lci1zdGVwcy1kb3du0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WWD confirmed this morning that Phoebe Philo, the British designer at the helm of Céline, will depart the label after presenting her final collection, for Fall 2018, in March. While the game of designer musical chairs between fashion labels has become commonplace, Philo’s exit after a decade marks the end of an era at the LVMH-owned fashion house, and for the world of women’s fashion overall.

LVMH doesn’t disclose revenues for individual labels, but Céline is widely understood to be a powerhouse, which Philo roughly quadrupled in size over her tenure, buffeted by a host of hit handbags.

But Philo’s legacy at Céline will go far beyond her impacts on LVMH’s bottom line.

At Céline, she changed the way women dressed by recognizing and respecting that women don’t have to wear their power in a way that’s loud, or overtly sexual. The oversized camel coats, lofty turtleneck sweaters, modern jewelry, and white Stan Smiths that have become a uniform for urbane women globally? That’s all Philo. Her looks on the runway—and the outfits she wore to take a bow after her shows—were widely imitated by admirers and fast-fashion imitators. It’s hard to imagine that the accessible, menswear-inspired looks that have filled Zara’s women’s department over the last several years would have existed without Céline’s influence.

And the shoes! In addition to Céline’s oft-imitated block-heeled pumps and Philo’s own white Stan Smiths, the designer showed sandals and heels covered in fur that looked shorn from the back of a very luxe Muppet. They were funny—but they were also kind of fabulous. And without them, I might not be leaving the house today in burgundy shearling-lined Birkenstocks.

While Philo created clothes that powerful women—gallerists, bankers, and editors among them—long to wear, she herself became a role model for self-assured (and stylish) feminists who won’t apologize for putting themselves and their families first. (Philo shied away from the spotlight herself, but gave “Philophiles” everywhere something to swoon over when she put Joan Didion in her ads in 2015.)

As a designer at Chloé in 2005, Philo skipped a season for maternity leave—a phrase not commonly uttered then in the high fashion world—and then left altogether in 2006, for a two-year hiatus before joining Céline. With Céline, she moved the headquarters from Paris to London, where her family lived, and forewent a runway show in 2012 when she was expecting her third child. No word on Philo’s next moves, but WWD reports that she has no immediate plans to work for another label.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999964237213135}",neutral,0.9999964237213135,0

Serial yacht owners: 3 billionaires transforming yachting - Yacht Harbour,"Thu, 07 Dec 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8veWFjaHRoYXJib3VyLmNvbS9uZXdzL3NlcmlhbC15YWNodC1vd25lcnMtLTMtYmlsbGlvbmFpcmVzLXRyYW5zZm9ybWluZy15YWNodGluZy0yMjY50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"











Building innovative yachts takes extensive, intimate knowledge of their use, only acquired at an owner's level, as well as large amounts of capital devoted to creating floating masterpieces. Yacht Harbour looks at some of the most inspiring billionaires from the superyacht space.





Bernard Arnault













Position: Chairman, LVMH





Net worth: $64 billion (2017)





Iconic in many ways, luxury conglomerate LVMH and its CEO, Bernard Arnault have long set a gold standard in the luxury world and yachting was no exception to this rule. In fact, Arnault's 101-meter yacht, Symphony is currently the largest Feadship ever built.





With a net worth currently valued at $64 billion by Forbes, Bernard Arnault's 33-year run shaping the luxury world through his Louis Vuitton Moet Henessy Group, took him to being the 2nd richest person in Europe and in the world's top 10 billionaires.





In yachting however, the 68 year-old Frenchmen is most well known for his involvement in the sector. His first major step into superyachts became the conversion of the 70-meter Amadeus into a luxury yacht from a research vessel in 2007.













Rebuilt at Jade Yachts in Taiwan, the transformation was overseen by Vripack to a design by Redmond Langton with Francois Zuretti creating the yacht's new interior. Accommodating up to 12 guests in a master suite spanning over the entire upper deck, a VIP suite on the main deck, and two guest and two twin cabins on the lower deck, she stretched over a total of five decks.





From a technical standpoint, the yacht is powered by twin Caterpillar engines letting the 70-meter yacht cruise for up to 16,400 nautical miles at a speed of 10.5 knots. In 2015, Arnault sold Amadeus, which was later renamed to Felix by its current owner.

Around the same time, Feadship delivered the 101-meter Symphony, the largest yacht it ever built. According to Marianne, Symphony was delivered to Maltese company, Sonata Yachting, a firm which LVMH disclosed was a fully owned subsidiary in its yearly report.





A common feature found across the two yachts are their golf tee located aft of the upper deck, which allows its guests to shoot specially designed, bio-degradable balls into the sea from the yacht. Designed by Tim Heywood, Symphony has a gross tonnage of near 3,000GT.

Arnault's interests in yachting however are not limited to his personal fleet. In 2008, LVMH led an acquisition of British yacht manufacturer, Princess Yachts from South African investor, Graham Beck in a transaction that amounted to just over €250 million. The deal then saw L Capital, a fund controlled by LVMH, gain a 70% controlling stake in Princess Yachts.





LVMH then continued its efforts to expand into yachting by acquiring Royal Van Lent, a shipyard part of Feadship, later that year in a deal that analysts put at around €400 million. The shipyard later went on to build the 101.5-meter Symphony and remains a part of LVMH's portfolio to this day.





Herb Chambers





Position : Chairman, Herb Chambers Companies





Net worth : $1,38 billion (2017)





Delivered in 2012 by Abeking & Rasmussen, the 60-meter Excellence V, one of the most voluminous yachts in her size, became her American's owner fifth superyacht. His fleet's next flagship, an 80-meter Abeking & Rasmussen is however still under construction.

Herb Chambers' first yacht became a 30ft Trojan fishing boat in 1970, he then upgraded to a 53ft Hatteras before starting his journey into the superyacht space with a 38.7-meter Feadship, Excellence. Launched in 1986, three years after Chambers sold his blooming copier sales business, A Copy, for $80 million, the yacht could reach 13.5 knots.





Later known as Golden Rule and last refitted in 2006, the yacht was sold by her new owners in 2011 at an asking price of $4.9 million. She was then renamed once again to Miss Iloilo in 2013.













Chambers next yachting project became an even larger Feadship, the 47.5-meter Excellence II launched in 1999. With an interior by Sam Sorgiovanni, the yacht had a beam of 8.9m and could reach a speed of 14.5 knots.





Later reportedly sold by Chambers to American businessman, Dennis M. Jones who renamed her to D'Natalin II, the yacht was then sold once again and renamed to Princess K. Now cruising under the name Princess Too, she was sold to her current owner in the summer of 2016 at an asking price of €15 million.













Launched this time by Abeking & Rasmussen in 2001, Excellence III became a 57-meter superyacht with an exterior by Donald Starkey designed with charter in mind. Praised for her comfortable seven cabin layout by guests, the yacht went on to have an inspiring charter record led by Chambers' long-time captain, Ray Shore.





Listed for sale in 2010 Excellence III was later sold in March 2012 asking $45,950,000. The popular charter yacht was then renamed to Dream following her sale and lengthened to 60-meters during her 2014 refit.













Chambers' subsequent project became a 78-meter Abeking & Rasmussen which was planned to take on the name Excellence IV. A few months into the build, Chambers received an offer to buy the yacht from a friend, which he decided to turn down.





Halfway through the build he however realised that such a project would prevent him from mooring in harbour such as Gustavia in St.Barts and Capri. When a Russian oligarch made another offer to buy the project at a profit for Chambers, the American businessman accepted. ""I did well on that one."" Chambers told Forbes. The yacht went on to become Eminence.













Following the sale, Chambers decided to take on another project at Abeking & Rasmussen building Excellence V, a 60-meter yacht with the interior volume and comfort of a 75-meter superyacht. Launched in 2011, she is now available for charter from €595,000 per week.













""There was a transition where it became a business for me"" Chambers told Forbes on his superyacht projects, ""I get more enjoyment out of building the boats than I do using them"". Chambers's Excellence IV, a 28-meter Pershing launched in 2014, might be the only exception to this rule as he keeps it for his personal use. The yacht was however listed for sale and is now asking $8,400,000.





Chambers, now owner of the Herb Chambers Companies, the largest automotive dealership group in New England, USA with over $2.5 billion in revenue in 2014, might however be on his most ambitious yachting project yet. Indeed, the American billionaire has commissioned an 80-meter project currently under construction at Abeking & Rasmussen, which he says will be a cross between M/Y A and a more traditional yacht.









Dennis Washington





Position : Chairman, Washington Companies





Net worth : $5,9 billion (2017)













Washington became acquainted with boating relatively late, according to one of his recent interviews, he stepped on a boat for the very first time in 1979, when he was 45 years old. His connection with the sea was however immediate, ""I just loved the sound of being out on the water and being so relaxed"" he told Forbes. Soon after, he purchased his first boat, the 25.9-meter Wanigan III for $150,000. What sets apart Washington from most yacht owners is his interest in refitting yachts up to his high standards. A year and a half after the purchase of the Wanigan III, he began to rebuild it and sold it a couple of years later.





In 1992 he purchased Chieftain, a 105ft tug built in Glasgow in 1929 that had escorted British WW2 ships and had remained under the British flag for nearly 60 years. Washington had the yacht shipped back to Vancouver by his port captain, Fred Larsson, and started a lengthy process to create the most tastefully decorated tug afloat. Washington in fact even announced that the newly named St. Eval would remain in the Washington family for perpetuity. St. Eval can now often be found moored in Washington's private marina in Vancouver.













Also docked in Vancouver is the 36.4-meter Abeking & Rasmussen, Impromptu, which Washington purchased from Boeing. Before serving as Boeing's corporate yacht as Daedalus, Impromptu was owned by beer magnate, August Busch. After learning that Boeing was looking to sell, he purchased and refitted the yacht, which he still owns to this day.













The first yacht to be named Attessa became yet another one of Washington's rebuild projects. After purchasing the 130ft Yecats built by Kong & Halvorsen in 1984, Washington lengthened the yacht to 142ft and renamed it to Attessa. The yacht later appeared in the movie ""Indecent Proposal"". It was then sold to George Argyros and renamed to Huntress before catching fire and sinking off the coast of Greece in 1998.





Washington's second Attessa became a Feadship launched in 1988 as Impromptu with a length of 43.4-meters. Following Washington buying the yacht in the 1990s, the yacht was extended by over 5 meters and renamed to Attessa II. The yacht was later reportedly sold to American billionaire, Wayne Huizenga who renamed her to Floridian. She then went through several changes of ownership until her current owners renamed the yacht to Mysorah and extensively refitted her once again.













Another vessel that is still part Washington's fleet to this day is Attessa III. Built by Feadship in 1998 as Lady Aviva for Joe Lewis, the 62-meter yacht caught fire in May 2000 in the Red Sea. With the owner and insurance company looking to get rid of it, Washington bought the superyacht and, after a 36-month long refit process at the Feadship De Vries shipyard, she reemerged as the fully rebuilt and extended 68m Attessa III. Completely transformed, Attessa III featured the largest composite extension in yachting history. Washington still owns the yacht to this day and keeps her on America's west coast.













Washington's most ambitious project however began just under two years later after Attessa III's launch. Having become aware that Taiwanese shipping billionaire, Chang Yung Fa was looking to sell his 91-meter Evergreen, Washington flew out to Taiwan to inspect the hull in 2007. ""Chairman Chang built the boat like a warship, but it was not attractive structurally. I thought it would be a great project."" he told Forbes. The American billionaire bought the yacht and sailed it to his Vancouver facility for a refit.













The refit process involved a new superstructure shape, interior layout, helipad and tender garage, which resulted in a completely new vessel. Lengthened by almost 10 meters, Attessa IV became the 24th largest in the world at the time of her relaunch in 2010. Amongst her standout features are a spa on the lower deck, a private cinema, a helipad and a multi-purpose room on the yacht's sundeck with a Chihuly chandelier under a glass dome.

The superyacht sector is, at its essence, a extremely small niche when one looks at absolute amounts, with barely 10,000 yachts over 24 meters in length. As a result, innovation in the sector requires drive and experience that only a few individuals in the world have been able to develop.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999992847442627}",neutral,0.9999992847442627,0
Designs on a new 'single glass' market: Domaine Chandon's $2 million makeover - The Australian Financial Review,"Tue, 26 Dec 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZnIuY29tL3Byb3BlcnR5L2NvbW1lcmNpYWwvZGVzaWducy1vbi1hLW5ldy1zaW5nbGUtZ2xhc3MtbWFya2V0LWRvbWFpbmUtY2hhbmRvbnMtMi1taWxsaW9uLW1ha2VvdmVyLTIwMTcxMjI2LWgwYTY1MdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To tap the demand, which Ms DeVenny said had been growing over the past five years, the renovation expanded the existing tasting bar with a ground-level lounge for casual visitors that was physically separate from the cellar door experience offered to the traditional tourist market. Previously the two distinct groups of visitors had all mingled in the one area.

""We get it all, unfortunately – or fortunately,"" she said. ""We certainly get tour groups and what we did was we created an upstairs space, like a mezzanine space, where they can have the hosted master class experience and people that are downstairs, don't get inundated by a group of 10, 12 people coming through at a time.""

The change of focus marked a challenge for a consumer goods company such as LVMH, said architect Adele Winteridge​, a director of Foolscap Studio, who led the redesign.

""For LVMH it is a struggle for them to go 'We'll spend money on hospitality',"" Ms Winteridge said. ""It's not their core business. But they're starting to come around to this idea.""

'Cellar doors are changing': Estate Director of Domaine Chandon Australia Shaine De Venny.

In part, the change was forced. The winery was struggling to efficiently manage the different groups from the more than 250,000 visitors it received per year.

""They had quite few functional issue with space as it was,"" Ms Winteridge said. ""Essentially they were getting a huge influx of people on the weekends and at certain times of the year. It wasn't able to deal with that amount of people.""

It's a redesign that also puts retail right at the centre of the experience. But having borrowed from the merchandising lessons of other products in the LVMH stable, such as watches, perfumes and handbags, Domaine Chandon went for the more subtle approach of well-curated displays.

""We didn't want to create a wine store,"" Ms DeVenny said. ""We're not a bottle shop. What we wanted to do was hero it, give information and almost allow people to browse the space like a bookstore… rather than having pallet loads of cartons on the floor.""

Less bottle shop, more boutique: Merchandising at the renovated winery borrows from the retailing lessons of LVMH's watches, perfumes and handbags.

The next step in the winery's transformation to tap the changing market, which Foolscap is currently working on, is a self-guided tour of the facilities that doesn't focus on the traditional educational process of how sparkling wine is produced, but is more brand-focused - and instagrammable.

""It's not the museum piece, it's something else,"" Ms Winteridge said. ""It might have a photo booth, where you take photos of yourself in Paris with a glass of fizz with your friends. That's coming up.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997853636741638}",neutral,0.9997853636741638,0
