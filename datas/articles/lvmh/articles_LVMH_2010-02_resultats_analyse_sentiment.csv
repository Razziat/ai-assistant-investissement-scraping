LVMH launches luxury online magazine Nowness - The Guardian,"Fri, 26 Feb 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9tZWRpYS9wZGEvMjAxMC9mZWIvMjYvbHZtaC1sdXh1cnktb25saW5lLW1hZ2F6aW5lLW5vd25lc3PSAVVodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vbWVkaWEvcGRhLzIwMTAvZmViLzI2L2x2bWgtbHV4dXJ5LW9ubGluZS1tYWdhemluZS1ub3duZXNz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In a move likely to provoke more debate on how the lines between editorial and promotional content are become ever more blurred, Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH) yesterday launched Nowness, an online magazine to inspire its readers – or perhaps we should call them consumers?

The project will blend luxury brands with what LVMH is calling ""information reference"". The venture is the latest example of editorial and advertising converging in fashion as retailers become publishers themselves. Until now, the printed Acne magazine was a prominent example of a distinguished yet high-end fashion magazine. Nowness will hope to be seen as its online equivalent.

Nowness, which has a simple, minimalist design, features a daily multimedia story - today it is a view of Lucian Freud's Holland Park studio by filmmaker Tim Meara; yesterday it was a slow-motion film shot by photographer Matthew Donaldson showing the flying hair of model Lily Donaldson pictured above.

The content ranges from art, fashion and photography to architecture to design, and will be created and curated by an international team of contributors and editors. LVMH said: ""Nowness is a brand of the luxury group LVMH, but the content is editorially independent.""

For online journalism, fashion is an interesting area. At London Fashion Week, it was reported that bloggers were snapping up front-row seats. With projects like Nowness, it looks like luxury companies are about to blog back.

"Wong Kar-Wai Attends Louis Vuitton ""Journeys Award"" Ceremony - Jing Daily","Mon, 22 Feb 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vamluZ2RhaWx5LmNvbS9wb3N0cy9ob25nLWtvbmctZGlyZWN0b3Itd29uZy1rYXItd2FpLWF0dGVuZHMtbG91aXMtdnVpdHRvbi1qb3VybmV5cy1hd2FyZC1jZXJlbW9uedIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Last Friday, luxury and culture once again collided in Hong Kong as the Louis Vuitton Journeys Awards were handed out at Canton Road Maison. Launched last September, the Louis Vuitton Journeys Award is given to a student from among Greater China's most respected universities who creates a short film that best exemplifies a journey.

At the prize-giving ceremony, Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar-Wai -- who was also instrumental in the creation of this award -- and representatives from Louis Vuitton gave speeches and handed out awards to filmmakers from Asia and Europe. From Luxury Insider :

The competition was devised as part of Louis Vuitton’s long-term support of the arts and to highlight its place in the world of travel. It was launched on September 3, 2009 in the presence of renowned Director, Wong Kar Wai and Antoine Arnault, the Head of Communications at Louis Vuitton. The competition asked students from the world’s most prestigious film schools to present their own interpretations of a journey.







The inspiration behind the competition was Wong Kar Wai’s own two-minute film of life as a journey, Blueberry Days. Based on Louis Vuitton’s Core Values advertising campaign, it featured famous personalities such as Mikhail Gorbachev, Sean Connery and Sofia Coppola.







The Jury’s Award went to Sho Tsukikawa from the Tokyo University of Film Arts for his film 'The Time Walker'; and The Public’s Choice Award (voted for by members of the public on Louis Vuitton’s website) was scooped by James Cogels, from Lawyer in Belgium.







Meanwhile the Jury President’s Award was handed to Gilitte Leung from Hong Kong for his [sic] work 'I Want to Make a Movie', which articulates the artist’s journey as a result of entering the completion. Wong Kar Wai acknowledged: “Your journey is bold and sincere (personal and tender). Congratulations on this first film and best luck in your future career.”

Louis Vuitton's commitment to promoting luxury and the arts, especially in Hong Kong, is definitely something to watch. Last year's ""Passion for Creation "" exhibition brought together Louis Vuitton and the Hong Kong Museum of Art , and attracted massive public interest. We could see more of these luxury + art partnerships in the mainland this year, too, following the success of initiatives like Cartier's “Treasures” exhibit at Beijing’s Forbidden City.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9968569278717041}",neutral,0.9968569278717041,0
BNB: RIP - Watchtime.com,"Mon, 01 Feb 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhdGNodGltZS5jb20vZmVhdHVyZWQvYm5iLXJpcC0yL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Movement maker BNB Concept is out of business. But its founder, and many of its watchmakers, have found a new gig.

Just months ago BNB Concept seemed to be smokin’. The Swiss maker of expensive, complicated movements for brands including Hublot, Concord and Bell & Ross, was being praised in press reports for its “phenomenal” growth. BNB’s founder and majority shareholder, Matthias Buttet, gave interviews describing the company’s 200% annual sales increases, recession be damned.

Matthias Buttet



The company was selling, yes, but getting paid was apparently something else. On January 18 the company, which had been based in Duillier, near Nyon, closed its doors.

One big reason was a huge portfolio of accounts receivable, which one source said amounted to more than $9 million, that BNB could not collect. Suddenly, the company behind such talked-about watches as Jacob & Co.’s 31-day Quenttin and Romaine Jerome’s Day and Night (it has two tourbillons, but doesn’t tell the time) was no more. Buttet told one Swiss paper he had tried to sell the company, but its heavy debts had scared away all suitors. In its heyday, BNB, founded in 2004, had more than 30 customers and employed some 200 people, including the small band of elite watchmakers Buttet had chosen to make branded, artisan watches under the banner “Confrérie Horlogère.”

Now Buttet (he’s one of the “B’s” in “BNB”: the other “B” and the “N” are Enrico Barbasini and Michel Navas) is starting a new chapter. Last week, Hublot, one of BNB’s biggest customers, hired Buttet to head a new “Haute Horlogerie” department to make complicated movements for the Hublot brand. Hublot chief Jean-Claude Biver told WatchTime he will hire 30 to 40 watchmakers from BNB. Biver said he is in the process of trying to buy all of BNB’s machinery. BNB machines and people will be relocated to Hublot’s new factory in Nyon, which opened last year. Prior to BNB’s collapse, but as a precautionary measure in its event, Hublot, which is owned by the LVMH luxury-goods group, had bought from it about $2 million of finished and unfinished movements so it would not be cut short.

Look for an in-depth report in WatchTime’s March/April issue.

BNB’s customers included Romain Jerome, Jacob & Co., DeWitt, Bell & Ross, and Concord","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999842643737793}",neutral,0.9999842643737793,0
Wine: Cloudy Bay - The Guardian,"Fri, 12 Feb 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9saWZlYW5kc3R5bGUvMjAxMC9mZWIvMTMvY2xvdWR5LWJheS13aW5lLXJldmlld9IBS2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9saWZlYW5kc3R5bGUvMjAxMC9mZWIvMTMvY2xvdWR5LWJheS13aW5lLXJldmlldw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Cloudy Bay: Sauvignon blanc Photograph: James Johnson

Cloudy Bay sauvignon blanc was once so hard to secure, even the sight of the calm greys and misty whites of its label caused a frisson of anticipation. This is the wine that forged New Zealand's glittering ­reputation for sauvignon blanc, whose startling clarity created such a cult following that each shipment sold out almost before it arrived. Now, though, as its 25th vintage is released, the stuff seems ubiquitous. ""More Cloudy Bay!"" promised an email that arrived as I began to write this. The 2009 is stacked up in ­Majestic; and Waitrose, which in the early days could buy enough only to stock it in four shops, now sells the stuff in 215 of its 220 branches and says, ""We have been assured we will continue to receive enough to justify being listed in nearly all our stores.""

Are we tiring of a wine whose tightly controlled allocations once helped feed a buying frenzy? ""Cloudy Bay still has some middle-class ­cachet,"" says one northern wine merchant. ""Enough for LVMH, the multinational that now owns it, to use it as a selling tool to get you to buy other still wines in their portfolio, which is such a hassle I no longer deal with them directly.""

""We probably sell as much as ever,"" says another, ""but whereas before it flew out the week it ­arrived, our 20 cases now last us six months. We can always get more if we want it. We tease the rep about the 'Cloudy Bay factory'.""

So how much more of it than there used to be is there, exactly? Oddly, LVMH refuses to answer this, save to admit cautiously that volumes have risen ""incrementally"", before adding a panicky-sounding non sequitur: ""We are still focused on quality."" Happily, I know how much Cloudy Bay sauvignon blanc is made today, because when I met their nice ­viticulturist Siobhan ­Harnett last May, she told me it was ""over 100,000 cases"". Now, 1.2m bottles is quite a lot – it's almost as much as the 1.3m produced by the entire ­English wine industry in 2008.

So is it still stand-out good? Not in my view. In a blind tasting of six NZ sauvignon blancs, Cloudy Bay failed to shine. It lacked vigour and excitement, and had a ­certain anonymity (fans might define it as ""purity"", but to me it tasted too dilute for the £18 price tag) common in crowd-pleasers. I much prefer Greywacke 2009 (£12.99, tauruswines.co.uk, noelyoungwines.co.uk; 13% abv), a personal venture from Kevin Judd, Cloudy Bay's founding ­wine-maker who released the reins there only recently. The truth is, there are now so many good NZ sauvignon blancs, there's no ­reason to pay through the nose for Cloudy Bay's.

Luxury Shotgun Maker’s Stock in Purdey Good Shape. But Not THAT Good. - The Truth About Guns,"Sat, 27 Feb 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRydXRoYWJvdXRndW5zLmNvbS9sdXh1cnktc2hvdGd1bi1tYWtlcnMtc3RvY2staW4tcHVyZGV5LWdvb2Qtc2hhcGUtYnV0LW5vdC10aGF0LWdvb2Qv0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldHJ1dGhhYm91dGd1bnMuY29tL2x1eHVyeS1zaG90Z3VuLW1ha2Vycy1zdG9jay1pbi1wdXJkZXktZ29vZC1zaGFwZS1idXQtbm90LXRoYXQtZ29vZC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Barrons reckons the stock in the Swiss holding company that owns venerable English shotgun maker Purdey is set to double. “Geneva-based Compagnie Financière Richemont (ticker: CFR.Switzerland) is a major player in the global luxury business and, like its two bigger European peers — LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH.France) and PPR (PP.France) — it suffered deeply in the global economic slump. Now, however, the luxury sector is coming back, and the anticipation already has boosted Richemont’s stock from about 14 Swiss francs a year ago.” My ticker symbol for this story: WTF. I reckon someone is trying to kite this stock, big time. A week ago, The Sunday Times was telling readers to invest £100,000 in a Purdey. Truth be told, Hulk Hogan has a better chance of a comeback in the next year than the luxury sector.

The market is flooded with “pre-owned” luxury goods: fine wines, classic Ferraris and vintage shotguns. Also, Purdey can only make so many Purdeys. To wit: “Today a bespoke Purdey can set you back £70,000 or more and take two years to make,” The Telegraph reports (far more sensibly). “Vintage buyers get this craftsmanship for a fraction of the price.”

Bottom line: invest in a used Purdey, not the company.

Oh, and the company’s Facebook page (317 fans) tells that Purdey’s discounting their brand extensions like crazy, offering “Up to 75% off RRP for example cashmere pullovers £95, wool tweed sports jackets £125, silk ties £20, three-quarter length leather jackets £295.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.97091144323349}",neutral,0.97091144323349,0
