Germanwings crash calls attention to Airbus safety history - The Guardian,"Wed, 25 Mar 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDE1L21hci8yNS9nZXJtYW53aW5ncy1wbGFuZS1jcmFzaC1hdHRlbnRpb24tYWlyYnVzLXNhZmV0edIBXWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDE1L21hci8yNS9nZXJtYW53aW5ncy1wbGFuZS1jcmFzaC1hdHRlbnRpb24tYWlyYnVzLXNhZmV0eQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The crash of the Germanwings flight in the Alps on Tuesday has focused attention on the safety record of the French aviation company Airbus, which manufactured the A320 plane involved in the incident. Experts have pointed out similarities between the crash that killed 150 people and another incident involving an Airbus flight last November.

On that occasion, data from malfunctioning sensors triggered a sudden plunge by an Airbus plane shortly after it had taken off from Bilbao, in northern Spain.

The A321 plane, operated by German airline Lufthansa, unexpectedly lost height after its automated systems misinterpreted important data. In that case, the plane had been flying on autopilot when the pilot noticed one of the displays was “increasing unusually rapidly”, according to the German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident Investigation.

The display was reporting the plane’s “angle of attack” information, which concerns the alignment of the wing line and flight path. However, the sensors were giving incorrect data.

That faulty data triggered the activation of the aircraft’s “Alpha Protection” system, which usually prevents stalling and the effects of windshear.

When this was combined with other technical information, the plane responded by automatically ordering “a nose-down pitch rate”, which meant that it effectively went into a dive.

“The nose of the airplane dropped further and the co-pilot counteracted this movement with the sidestick,” noted the report. “The co-pilot stated the airplane did not respond as expected and continued to descend.”

For at least 45 seconds, the pilot battled to stop the plane from dropping any further, as it plunged around 4,000 feet.

Only when the controlling sidestick was pushed as far back as possible were the plane’s systems overridden to allow it to fly horizontally again.

It subsequently emerged that some of the plane’s sensors had frozen shortly after take-off and only defrosted as the plane came into Munich to land.

At the time, Airbus issued an “operational engineering bulletin”, which is a rapid-response temporary notice sent out by the manufacturer to the users of an aircraft.

On 14 December 2014, the European Aviation Safety Agency also sent out an emergency directive for overriding the “undue activation of Alpha Protection” for Airbus planes. The directive warned pilots to switch off sensors if they malfunction.

Some aviation experts believe that as plane operation systems have become more sophisticated, pilots have become increasingly dependant on them. This can lead to serious difficulties if the systems develop a fault, as was the case with a 2009 Air France crash. In that case, an Airbus A330 crashed after leaving Brazil for an overnight flight to France. Frozen sensors led pilots to misinterpret the situation and crash the plane into the Atlantic. All 228 people on board were killed.

Recent Airbus disasters also include the AirAsia 8501 flight which crashed into the Java Sea last December, killing all 162 people on board.

In October 2005, a British Airways Airbus A319 suffered a “major electrical failure” as it was leaving Heathrow on its way to Budapest.

“This resulted in the loss or degradation of a number of important aircraft systems,” noted the subsequent Air Accidents Investigation Branch report.

The report noted that the pilot tried to transmit a mayday call to air traffic control but it was not received because the radio had also lost power. In this case, the pilots were able to reboot the systems and the plane continued its journey.

On Wednesday, French safety investigators said that they had not “the slightest explanation” for the Germanwings crash, which has triggered a wide range of theories.

David Gleave, a former air accident investigator, said that it was “very unclear” what had happened to the plane.

“The wreckage trail looks like it was flying relatively level and fast when it hit the terrain,” he said. “It doesn’t fit a depressurisation profile because you would drop to 10-12,000 feet and then level out. At this point, it is incredibly difficult to work out what happened to that plane.”

Brian Alexander, a pilot and partner at the aviation law firm Kreindler & Kreindler, said that there were elements of the crash that seemed unusual.

“The plane descended faster than a glide, but it doesn’t look like a catastrophically uncontrolled descent either,” he said.

Confusion has surrounded the crash because there was no distress call from the pilots in the eight minutes after the plane started diving from its cruising height of 38,000 feet.

Traffic controllers tried to contact the plane when they noticed its rapid descent, but received no response.

“They are taught ‘aviate, navigate, communicate,’ but you might expect some acknowledgement that they were in difficulties during eight minutes,” Alexander said.

Airbus is responsible for manufacturing some of the most popular aircraft in the world, which log millions of incident-free hours in the air every year. It has delivered around 6,200 short-haul and medium-haul jets in the A320 group.

The Germanwings plane that crashed this week had been delivered to Lufthansa in 1991, three years after the first A320 entered service. The plane was transferred to Germanwings, and had flown approximately 58,300 flight hours in around 46,700 flights in the last 24 years."
A lingering question after Germanwings jet crash: Just how safe is the Airbus A320? - The Washington Post,"Tue, 24 Mar 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy53YXNoaW5ndG9ucG9zdC5jb20vbmV3cy90aGUtc3dpdGNoL3dwLzIwMTUvMDMvMjQvYS1saW5nZXJpbmctcXVlc3Rpb24tYWZ0ZXItZnJhbmNlLWpldC1jcmFzaC1qdXN0LWhvdy1zYWZlLWlzLXRoZS1haXJidXMtYTMyMC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"You've most likely flown aboard an Airbus A320, the kind of jet that crashed in the French Alps on Tuesday with 150 people onboard. One of the world's most widely used aircraft, it is flown by virtually every U.S. airline, and one of the A320 fleet's jets takes off or lands every 2.5 seconds. But the short-haul, single-aisle A320 has also been at the center of a dozen fatal accidents since 1988, including in December, when an AirAsia jet crashed into the Java Sea, killing 162 passengers and crew.

So just how safe is the A320? For every million takeoffs, the A320 fleet has about 0.14 fatal accidents, according to a Boeing study that analyzed five decades of air disasters. That puts it on par with the Boeing 777 as one of the least dangerous commercial planes in the sky.

""In terms of accident rates, it's one of the safest jets built,"" said Richard Aboulafia, an aviation expert and vice president of aerospace consultancy Teal Group Corp. ""There are no reasons to question its record.""

Run by Germanwings, the low-cost offshoot of German airline Lufthansa, the passenger flight from Barcelona to Düsseldorf was carrying six crew members and 144 passengers, including a group of 16 schoolchildren, all of whom are now presumed dead.

Flight 9525 crashed after an eight-minute descent into a snowy, mountainous region of the Alps about 400 miles southeast of Paris, near the small village of Meolans-Revel and Pra Loup, a popular southern France ski resort. Airbus said it plans to dispatch a go-team of technical advisers to help investigate the crash, one of Western Europe's worst plane disasters in decades.

The crashed jet, which had flown 58,300 hours across 46,700 flights, was delivered to Lufthansa from the production line in 1991. That makes it one of the older A320s but still within the average age of planes in service. The average A320 flown by Delta, for instance, is about 20 years old, airline data show.

Asked if the airline would ground its A320s, Germanwings spokesman Thomas Winkelmann said the planes have a ""fabulous service record"" and said there would be further investigation. The jet's last major inspection was in 2013, though a regular check of the plane was conducted Monday, the day before the crash, Germanwings officials said.

Germanwings officials said there were contradictory reports on whether a distress signal was sent. Responding to German media speculation that a computer glitch could have forced the plane into a steep dive, Germanwings said they believed that had not caused the crash and that the A320's computer systems were fully updated.

Airbus, which made its name on wide-body jets like the A300, found worldwide success with the A320, which boosted the airline's profile and forced rival carriers like Boeing to step up competition for their similar jet, the 737. The twin-engine, single-aisle A320 is able to fit 150 passengers and efficiently reach long ranges.

The A320 family has expanded to nearly 6,200 aircraft worldwide; the family includes similar jets, including the smaller A318 and A319 and extended A321. The fleet has accumulated 150 million flight hours across more than 85 million flights, Airbus said. Almost all domestic mainline flights today either rely on an A320 or 737.

""It’s extraordinarily popular and regarded as a reliable, safe aircraft, one that’s in service in every part of the world,"" said Seth Kaplan, the managing partner for Airline Weekly. Nearly all major U.S. airlines fly them; the only notable exceptions are Southwest and Alaska Airlines, which use exclusively Boeing jets.

The investigation into the last major A320 crash, of an AirAsia flight bound for Singapore, has focused on severe thunderstorms and the jet's abnormally steep climb. But four other crashes over the past few years have drawn eyes to the A320.

In August 2011, pilot error caused an Airbus A320-214 flown by Gulf Air to skid off the runway at Kochi airport in India. In 2009, a US Airways A320-214 flown by pilot Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger smashed into a flock of geese shortly after takeoff and crashed into the Hudson River in New York. No one was hurt.

In 2008, an Airbus A320 leased by Germany's XL Airways crashed into the Mediterranean Sea after a test-flight engine malfunction, killing seven. In 2007, during the deadliest A320 crash to date, a jet overshot an airport runway in São Paulo, Brazil, and erupted once it hit a fueling station, killing nearly 200.

Germanwings is used for cheaper flights outside major hubs in Frankfurt and Munich for Lufthansa, Europe's largest airline. The closest American analogue, Kaplan said, would be United Airlines' TED division or US Airways' MetroJet.

There was a time when budget airlines were seen as skimping on safety, particularly after a fatal crash involving ValuJet Airlines, but low-cost airlines now boast low accident rates and safety records very similar to larger legacy carriers, experts said."
New names for Airbus Helicopters models - Vertical Mag - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 03 Mar 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvbmV3bmFtZXNmb3JhaXJidXNoZWxpY29wdGVyc21vZGVscy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Under a new naming convention, the AS350 B3e will be called the H125. Airbus Helicopters Photo

Airbus Helicopters announced new names for its fleet of production aircraft this morning, with an “H” replacing the “EC” designation for the majority of the fleet, while the iconic AStar will change from AS350 to “H125.”

The move was announced by Airbus Helicopters president and CEO Guillaume Faury this morning at the company’s annual Heli-Expo press briefing, in which he also teased the name for the X4, due to be announced later this morning.

Faury said the naming convention followed the lead of Airbus’ fixed-wing division, with aircraft taking designations such as A320 and A350. And it will also borrow the example set for the fixed-wing company’s military aircraft, with an “M” prefix following the civilian designation. So, the EC725 will become the H225M.

Faury said the new convention would help position the company’s helicopters in its range, and would open up new naming possibilities; previously, the last digit of the “AS” or “EC” names were related to the number of engines. With the single-engine AS350 becoming the H125, this is no longer the case, and he said it gave the company new options for the X4 naming.

However, pilots, mechanics and operators tied to the iconic “AStar” and “TwinStar” names need not worry — the aircraft will retain these nicknames, as will the H225 Super Puma, and the H155 Dauphin.

“Moving forward, we will continue to use these names,” said Faury. “They really mean something for you, [and] for the operators.”

The new designations include:

EC120 to H120

AS350 B3e to H125

EC130 to H130

EC135 to H135

EC145 to H145

EC155 to H155

EC175 to H175

EC225 to H225"
CEO Interview: ATR chiefs says no 90-seater without Airbus support - Leeham News and Analysis,"Tue, 03 Mar 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wMy8wMy9jZW8taW50ZXJ2aWV3LWF0ci1jaGllZnMtc2F5cy1uby05MC1zZWF0ZXItd2l0aG91dC1haXJidXMtc3VwcG9ydC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"March 3, 2015, c. Leeham Co: ATR, the turbo-prop OEM 50% owned by Airbus and 50% by Finmeccanica, wants to develop a new airplane to replace the venerable ATR 42/72 series that entered service in 1985 and 1989 respectively..

Airbus, as half owner, has the power to block the plan–and it has, saying that because ATR has 85%-90% of the market, a new airplane isn’t needed.

Despite this huge market share, ATR CEO Patrick de Castelbajac says ATR doesn’t “own” the market. The need for a larger, 90-seat turbo-prop mirrors an industry trend toward up-gauging and the ATR 72 has been stretched probably as far as it can go, says de Castelbajac.

But if Airbus isn’t on board, development of a new airplane isn’t possible, he says.

“With Airbus owning 50% there is no way we can build a 90-seater without Airbus on board,” says the ATR chief.

With Airbus saying “no,” ATR continues to look for ways to improve the ATR 72. It’s certified for 74 passengers and ATR is seeking certification for 78 using slim-line seats, a path taken by Bombardier for the Q400, now certified for 86 seats with the slim-line option.

ATR continues to study whether a neo—the New Engine Option—makes

sense, but de Castelbajac says this could result in design creep.

“There’s no technical non-starter,” he says. “We are talking with Pratt and another engine manufacturer to see how it could be done. Our aircraft is not burning much fuel to begin with. We’re looking at the engines and propellers, the entire propulsion system. But if you do that you may have to change the wing. You want to change the bleed. I’m trying to calm down engineers, everyone wants to get excited.”

Everyone, it seems, except ATR’s own chief financial officer, who de Castelbajac says isn’t excited in part because of today’s low fuel prices.

“Fuel prices being where it is now it makes the business case less attractive,” he says. “I have to get my finance people excited.” De Castelbajac doesn’t see fuel prices staying down extended time.

Another issue working against a 90-seat design: de Castelbajac says the ATR 72 is already an advanced design.

“The ATR 72 flew after the A320, it’s a modern aircraft, it’s got a glass cockpit and the cabin redone a couple of years ago. There’s no imminent need to do it. My predecessor wanted to launch next generation of turboprop but the fact is we are doing very well with 72 and we’re still selling 10 or more 42s per year. Airbus doesn’t see competition coming to bite us.”

Still, aviation technology doesn’t stand still. Fabrice Bregier, CEO of Airbus Commercial, wants to see further improvements to the ATR, following the course he’s set for the mainline jet product lines.

“Fabrice sees a need to continue to improve the platform, cabin, avionics, incremental improvements, which of course is much easier to do than go for an all new aircraft,” de Castelbajac says.

ATR may not “own” the market, but it does have an overwhelming majority of between 85%-90% of the backlog at any given time vis-à-vis Bombardier and the Q400.

See our previous posts here, here and here about the market shares and related issues.

De Castelbajac believes the Q400 fills too narrow a niche: the high-speed sector above the baseline 300 mi turbo-prop routes and below the pure jet markets. Routes that are 300nm, about an hour, are the heart-of-the market for which the Q400 is not well suited, he says.

But new competition may be coming. India and Indonesia governments have announced programs to develop 80-90 seat turbo-props. Each country has burgeoning requirements for small airplanes serving small cities. But developing airplanes that can be exported requires certification from Europe’s EASA and the USA’s Federal Aviation Administration, tasks that are tough to meet. De Castelbajac isn’t concerned about these projects any time soon.

On the other hand, Embraer, should it choose to reenter the passenger turbo-prop market, has the ability, skills, funding and market knowledge to become a serious competitor. But de Castelbajac thinks Embraer’s next family of airplanes will be larger than its E-Jets, not a down-sizing to turbo-props.

ATR’s greatest market penetration is in Asia. It has very little in North America, where only about 80 ATRs are operating, with about half as cargo feeders for FedEx.

“One of the reasons we’ve failed to come back into the [US] market is the [union] scope clause, which doesn’t encourage airlines and pilots to go for turbo-props,” de Castelbajac says. Also, on the ATR, passengers board aircraft in the rear of the aircraft. “In many airports in small countries, [this] is an advantage but it is a disadvantage in US.”

Still, he sees thin routes supporting only 50 seat aircraft as a continuing need in the US, and for this the ATR 42 is “the best option.”

“I will focus on the way back into the US market,” he says.

Another, much broader objective is promoting safety among the small airlines and developing regions in which the ATR operates. Operations and training are bigger issues than the airplane.

“We are focusing on support to airlines on this,” de Castelbajac says “That’s the key to us. As soon as pilots get a couple of thousand hours they go to larger airlines. Operations are tough. There are short runways and not necessarily good ATCs. We are working with airlines, authorities to improve safety.”

Germanwings crash raises concerns with Airbus cockpit design - Fortune,"Fri, 27 Mar 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAxNS8wMy8yNy9nZXJtYW53aW5ncy1jcmFzaC1haXJidXMtY29ja3BpdC1kZXNpZ24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 on Tuesday sent a stark message that aircraft manufacturer Airbus needs to address issues with the design and layout of its cockpits.

The crash, along with others recently involving Airbus aircraft, show that it’s too easy for junior officers to take control of the plane. The cockpit door latching system, a major focus in Tuesday’s crash, should be reexamined, as it allows junior officers to deny reentry into the cockpit to anyone, even the captain of the aircraft. In addition, the dual joystick fly-by-wire control system remains troublesome as it allows junior pilots to override the actions of more senior pilots without them knowing, creating confusion that could bring down a jet.

Lufthansa, which owns Germanwings, confirmed on Thursday that the crash of Flight 9525 was due to “deliberate” pilot error. Apparently, the junior pilot, Andreas Günter Lubitz, 27, was left alone in the cockpit while the senior pilot, Patrick Sonderheimer, left the cockpit, presumably to go to the bathroom. When Sonderheimer tried to get back into the cockpit, he was unable to gain entry. He is heard yelling for Lubitz to open the door on the flight’s cockpit voice recorder, which was analyzed by crash experts on Wednesday.

Sonderheimer tried to regain entry into the cockpit for 10 minutes while the plane was in a steady, yet sharp, descent downward.

Throughout the commotion, nothing was heard from inside the cockpit, except for Lubitz’s breathing, officials say. The last sounds on the recording were of the senior pilot trying to break the cockpit door down, followed by the screams of passengers right before the plane crashed on the side of a mountain in the French Alps, killing all 150 people on board.

Officials say that the junior pilot used the flight management system to start the descent of the plane, which, at the altitude the flight was at, could only be done voluntarily. This has led officials to believe that the co-pilot deliberately set in motion the events that caused the crash.

Asked whether this was suicide, Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said at an afternoon press conference, “I am not a lawyer. I am the CEO of a big company. If one person takes 149 people with him to death, it is not suicide.”

To be fair, we are waiting for the results of the flight’s data recorder, which records the pilots instructions sent to any electronic systems on an aircraft. It is conceivable that something may have happened to Lubitz after he activated the flight management system, such as a brain aneurysm, leaving him unconscious and unable to open the cockpit door for the other pilot.

If you are wondering how a senior pilot could be locked out of the cockpit, you’re in good company. Following the events of September 11, airlines were mandated to beef up cockpit security. Keys would no longer be allowed to access the cockpit amid fear that a terrorist could somehow wrestle them away from a flight attendant. On the Germanwings flight, the cockpit door was controlled by an electronic keypad located outside the cockpit as well as a switch located inside the cockpit in the center console.

On the A320, the model used for Germanwings Flight 9525, the locking switch in the cockpit can be toggled up or down. If the switch is up, the door will unlock. If it is left in the neutral (center) position, the door will be locked, as is required by law while in flight. When it is toggled down, the door locks as it does in the neutral position but it also prevents the use of the numerical keypad on the outside of the door to gain entry for five minutes. We don’t know for sure if the door was put in the locked position by Lubitz once the senior pilot left the cockpit, nor do we know if the senior pilot tried to gain entry into the cockpit using the digital keypad (officials say he just banged on the door).

But whether this was deliberate or an accident, the failsafes and the door locking system failed. It either locked the senior pilot out or locked the junior pilot in. An official from Airbus tells Fortune that it designed the door so that it can only be unlocked from inside the cockpit because it was mandated to do so by the FAA following the events of September 11. But the lock switch is located in the cockpit and potential override procedures are not mandated by government authorities.

Airbus places the lock switch in the center console by default, which means that either pilot could accidentally toggle the switch if they collapsed for some reason. Airbus says that it offers airlines the choice of having the switch mounted either in the center console, as it is now by default, or mounted above the pilots on the ceiling of the aircraft. The ceiling position seems like a far more sensible place to put this switch to avoid accidentally toggling it.

The issue involving the placement of the lock switch isn’t unique to Airbus. Boeing, in its rival 737 aircraft, puts its door switch 10 centimeters away from the airplane’s rudder control button. The proximity of these items almost led to tragedy in 2011 when a junior pilot onboard an an All Nippon Airways flight accidentally toggled the rudder control button by mistake, thinking he was unlocking the door for the captain who had been on break. The sharp turn of the rudder caused the plane to violently roll on its axis and fly upside down—seriously. Luckily, no one died in this incident, but it could have easily ended very badly for everyone onboard.

While Boeing and Airbus share design concerns about the location of their locking buttons, Airbus alone uses a unique dual joystick flight controller that can be very dangerous in an emergency. The dual controllers are located on the sides of the aircraft—to the left of the captain, who normally occupies the left-hand seat, and to the right of the junior pilot, who normally occupies the right-hand seat. These joysticks are problematic because they allow either pilot to move the aircraft’s pitch up and down or side to side without the other one knowing. That’s because the pilots’ bodies can obscure the movements being made by their hand on the joystick. The placement of the joysticks became a major source of contention for Airbus in 2009, with the downing of Air France Flight 447, an Airbus 330 en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris. In this incident, the captain had left the cockpit to take a rest, leaving the first officer and junior pilot in charge of the aircraft (this aircraft had three pilots given the flight time and aircraft type). When the plane reached its cruising altitude over the Atlantic Ocean, its pitot tubes, which measure air speed and such, froze, rendering them useless. As a result, the autopilot was automatically switched off. Pilots are not used to maneuvering a jet at such high altitudes, so both panicked when they were given control of the plane, especially the junior pilot. Fear of crashing caused the junior pilot to instantly push up on the joystick, pulling the nose upward. This caused the plane to stall and fall straight down like a rock. The captain came rushing into the cabin and was working with the first officer to try and stabilize the plane, but neither could understand why they were rapidly losing altitude. Then the junior pilot said in panic, “But I’ve had the stick back the whole time!” At that moment the captain realized that the junior pilot had been causing the stall and told him to let go, but it was already too late and the plane crashed into the ocean. The location of these joysticks are a major source of contention among pilots. Some, like Captain Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger, who famously landed an out-of-control Airbus on the Hudson River after it struck a flock of birds during takeoff, believes that such confusion wouldn’t have happened onboard a Boeing jet because the control wheels are larger and more obvious. The Boeing controls, called a yoke, look like two big steering wheels and sit directly in front of both pilots. If one pilot changes the pitch, the other would instantly know it, as the yoke in front of them would move. Airbus officials tell Fortune that it would be wrong to conflate the issues that brought down Flight 447 with the apparently deliberate issues that brought down Flight 9525. But while the Airbus sidestick doesn’t seem to be an issue in the crash of Flight 9525, it is yet another example of how junior pilots with less experience can bring down a plane. Airbus said it believes younger pilots are just as capable as older pilots in handling an aircraft, given their extensive training by their employers. Airbus can’t design a perfect cockpit, but it should design failsafes that prevent junior officers from taking control of aircraft at critical moments. For example, in addition to moving the lock button to the ceiling, the captain should also be able to enter a special code on the keypad outside the door, known only to him, which would allow him to immediately override the lock switch. Furthermore, junior pilots shouldn’t be allowed to control an aircraft without the captain or first officer knowing exactly what they are doing. This might involve relocating the side sticks to the center of the craft so that both pilots can easily see what the other is doing. While it may turn out that Lubitz did indeed set the plane on a collision course with the French Alps, a great deal of information—namely, the flight data recorder—needs to be recovered and analyzed before making any conclusions. It is possible that the plane’s autopilot was knocked out in midflight, as what happened on Air France Flight 447, and Lubitz panicked and froze. In any case, Lubitz should have never been allowed to lock himself into the cockpit, with no way for the captain to re-enter. New procedures requiring flight attendants to switch places with pilots who leave the cockpit are being implemented in airlines across Europe in the wake of this accident. That may help decrease the chances of such a scenario occurring again, but it’s far from a sure thing."
New radar technologies from Airbus Defence and Space improve Air Traffic Control - Airbus,"Tue, 10 Mar 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNS0wMy1uZXctcmFkYXItdGVjaG5vbG9naWVzLWZyb20tYWlyYnVzLWRlZmVuY2UtYW5kLXNwYWNlLWltcHJvdmUtYWly0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Summary

Enhanced detection capabilities and suppression of interference signals on its Airport Surveillance Radar Next Generation

Airbus Defence and Space has introduced new technologies in its latest air surveillance radar which give the ASR-NG (= Airport Surveillance Radar Next Generation) advantageous air traffic control capabilities. The company has completed a demonstration in real scenarios in front of international customers which was testament to enhanced detection capabilities with a significant increase of detection range coverage to 120 NM (220 km). Other key features of ASR-NG are the complete mitigation of wind farm effects, a new Primary Surveillance Radar 3D height measurement and resistance against interference by 4G/LTE mobile phone signals.

“ASR-NG offers an extraordinary performance proven in an extensive test phase,” said Thomas Müller, head of Airbus Defence and Space’s Electronics business line. “With its new capabilities it addresses the most urgent and recent concerns of air surveillance and air traffic control customers.”

ASR-NG consists of a primary radar on the basis of a solid state transmitter and advanced signal processing technology for long-range surveillance. Its extreme sensitivity means that even very small objects such as mini drones, slow flying objects such as helicopters or even flocks of birds can be reliably detected and classified. Specifically developed algorithms allow for safe guidance of aircraft even in the vicinity of wind turbines, which is hardly possible with conventional air traffic control radar systems.

This extraordinary primary surveillance radar capability is combined with the MSSR 2000I (MSSR = Monopulse Secondary Surveillance Radar) secondary radar for automatic identification of individual aircraft. It meets the new air traffic control standards “Mode S” and “ADS-B”, which greatly improve aircraft identification queries and are currently being introduced in European airspace.

Airbus Defence and Space supplies air traffic control and identification systems in the military and civilian sector. Amongst others, the company equips the German Armed Forces’ airports with the ASR-S (Airport Surveillance Radar, S-Band) airport surveillance radar and delivers a complete approach control system for the military airfields in Switzerland. In addition, the MSSR 2000I secondary radar is deployed by the naval forces of Germany, France, Norway and Finland for military friend-or-foe identification.

Germanwings Plane Crash: How Safe Is Airbus A320 at Cruising Altitude? | TIME - TIME,"Tue, 24 Mar 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vdGltZS5jb20vMzc1NjYxMC9nZXJtYW53aW5ncy1jcmFzaC1zYWZldHktYTMyMC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Any plane crash involving a passenger carrier is highly unlikely—but Tuesday’s loss of a Germanwings Airbus A320 in the French Alps is especially unusual given the tragedy’s circumstances.

Flight 9525 was carrying 150 people at a cruising altitude of 38,000 feet Tuesday morning before it began rapidly descending, officials said. That’s an unfortunately familiar story—the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 and AirAsia Flight 8501 crashes happened at cruising altitude. But it’s also very rare: only 10% of fatal accidents involving a plane damaged beyond repair involved a plane that had reached cruising altitude, according to a report by Boeing. Officials said Thursday that the co-pilot intentionally crashed the plane.

But most accidents (called “hull loss fatal accidents”) occur during takeoff and landing. Recent examples include last month’s TransAsia Flight 235 crash, which suffered engine failure 37 seconds after takeoff, or last year’s TransAsia Flight 222 crash, which crashed on landing due to bad weather.

Previous reasons for catastrophe at cruising altitude have ranged from pilot suicide to structural failure to terrorist bombings. The White House said Tuesday there is “no indication of a nexus to terrorism” regarding the Germanwings flight.

But the Germanwings crash is unusual for another reason, too. The plane involved, an Airbus A320, has one of the best safety records compared to other popular models, with 0.14 hull loss fatal accidents per million departures, according to Boeing, which analyzed safety data between 1959 and 2013.

During that time range, the Airbus A320 was roughly as safe as the long-range Boeing 777, which had 0.13 hull loss fatal accidents per million departures. It was also roughly as safe the Boeing 737 family and Embraer (EMB) family, some of the most common jets used for shorter commercial flights.

Keep in mind Boeing’s data only goes through 2013. So for better or for worse, it doesn’t account for Malaysia Airlines’ two tragedies in 2014 that involved the Boeing 777. And since the Boeing 777 had only 3 hull losses before then, the 777’s hull loss fatal accident rate has now likely almost doubled. Boeing’s data also doesn’t account for the two recent A320 accidents—the Germanwings crash and the AirAsia crash in December—though these will have less of an impact on the A320 family’s rate, since those aircraft had 19 hull losses through 2013."
How Airbus A320 cockpit doors work - Business Insider,"Thu, 26 Mar 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vaG93LWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIwLWNvY2twaXQtZG9vcnMtd29yay0yMDE1LTPSAU1odHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2hvdy1haXJidXMtYTMyMC1jb2NrcGl0LWRvb3JzLXdvcmstMjAxNS0zP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A plane cockpit.

Now that French and German officials have said the Germanwings co-pilot on flight 4U9525 deliberately crashed the plane, cockpit safety procedures that allowed the co-pilot to lock the captain out are being called into question.

On Tuesday, an Airbus A320 flying from Barcelona, Spain, to Düsseldorf, Germany crashed into the French alps, killing all 150 people on board.

A cockpit voice recording from the plane reveals that the co-pilot, who was alone in the cockpit as the plane plummeted into the French alps, could be heard breathing until the plane crashed, killing all 150 people on board. The co-pilot, identified as 28-year-old German national Andreas Lubitz, didn't say a word while he was locked inside the cockpit.

German officials said at a press conference Thursday that the co-pilot prevented the captain from reentering the cockpit.

""It's obvious this co-pilot took advantage of the commander's absence,"" Marseille public prosecutor Brice Robin said. ""Could he have known he would leave? It is too early to say.""

While US regulations require a flight attendant to go into the cockpit when a pilot is left alone, there is no such requirement in Europe.

There are also some new mechanisms in place on planes that allow a pilot to lock the cockpit from the inside.

Related stories

New safety regulations were put into place around the world after 9/11 to reinforce cockpit doors and increase security on planes. The Wall Street Journal noted in 2001 that this could come with its own set of problems.

Pilots (and, presumably, flight crew members) used to be able to break through cockpit doors if necessary, but newer, reinforced cockpit doors prevent that. The cockpit voice recorder on flight 9525 revealed that the captain of the plane tried to break into the cockpit with no success.

An Airbus video shows the mechanisms the planes have to reinforce their cockpits.

There's a keypad near the cockpit door that can notify cockpit crew of a request for entry or open the door if the pilots are incapacitated.

But there is also a switch that allows a pilot inside to override the keypad outside and keep the door locked.

The flight crew is supposed to be able to gain access to the cockpit by using a special code they enter on a keypad.

The pilot then gets a warning in the cockpit that the door is about to be unlocked.

It's not clear what the exact system was on the Germanwings Airbus plane, as regulations vary by country. But it seems apparent that the co-pilot was able to lock out the pilot.

""The guy outside is knocking lightly on the door and there is no answer,"" Aasenior French military official with knowledge of a cockpit voice recording from the plane told The New York Times on Wednesday. ""And then he hits the door stronger and no answer. There is never an answer. ... You can hear he is trying to smash the door down.""

The official added: ""We don’t know yet the reason why one of the guys went out,” the official told the Times. ""But what is sure is that at the very end of the flight, the other pilot is alone and does not open the door.""

Lubitz had little professional flight experience, having only logged 630 flight hours before co-piloting the doomed flight 9525.

He joined Germanwings in September 2013 after training at the Lufthansa Flight Training School in Bremen, according to Lufthansa officials."

The chief executive of Lufthansa’s lowcost arm, Germanwings, said the aircraft reached its cruising height of 38,000ft at 10.45am, 44 minutes into the flight, and began the descent just a minute or two later. Contact was lost at 10.53am when the plane was at 6,000ft.

The dead are believed to include 45 Spanish and 67 German nationals. A school party of 16 German teenagers returning from an exchange trip to Spain were booked on the plane but school officials could not say if the group had boarded.

The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who said she would travel to the crash site on Wednesday, said the crash had plunged Germany, France and Spain into “deep mourning”.

Spain’s King Felipe VI said he was cancelling his state visit to France to return to Spain. The country’s prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, also spoke briefly to the press. “We’re facing a dramatic and very sad accident,” he said. “We’re going to do everything in our power to help, to help the families and give them our support.”

The French weather station said the meteorogical conditions were calm at the time of the accident and that the sky was “completely clear”, with almost no wind.

The Airbus A320 crashed in the commune of Méolans-Revel, an isolated area of small villages and hamlets that are difficult to reach. Debris is scattered over an area of 2 sq km, according to French search and rescue.



Sebastien Giroux, one of the first eyewitnesses, said he saw the aircraft flying very low. “There was no smoke or particular sound or sign of anything wrong, but at the altitude it was flying it was clearly not going to make it over the mountains,” he told BFM-TV. “I didn’t see anthing wrong with the plane, but it was too low.”



Initial reports said a distress call was made by the pilots at 10.47am but French authorities later said this was not the case.

Pierre-Henry Brandet, a French interior ministry spokesman, told BFM television that he expected “an extremely long and extremely difficult” operation because of the area’s remoteness.

“The aircraft debris has been localised, and we can only fear a heavy death toll. The first information from rescuers suggests that the number of survivors, if there are any, will be low, but until we have reached the site by land, we cannot say with any certitude. The rescuers are being taken in by helicopter,” Brandet said.

Gilles Gravier, president of Tourism in the Val d’Allos ski resort area, said nothing of the crash had been heard from the pistes in his village. He said 400 gendarmes, firefighters and emergency search and rescue personnel had been mobilised but the zone was “extremely difficult” to get to.

Florent Plazy, director of the local ski school ESF, said the area was hard to access even for mountain walkers. Eric Ciotti, head of the regional council, said search and rescue teams were headed to the crash site.

The French president, François Hollande, said it was likely there were no survivors.

At Düsseldorf Airport, where the Germanwings plane was expected to arrive earlier today, the relatives of those who were on the flight have been taken into a separate area where they are being taken care of, according to the German broadcaster ARD.



Airport care teams are waiting for other family members to arrive. Flights are continuing from the airport as normal, although it is said to be a “difficult situation” for those boarding.

Spain’s airport operator, Aena, said the plane left Barcelona at 8.55am, a slight delay from its expected departure of 8.35am. It did not know the reason for the delay. It said it had designated a special room in terminals 1 and 2 of Barcelona’s El Prat airport for family members and media.



Airbus said on Twitter: “We are aware of the media reports. All efforts are now going towards assessing the situation. We will provide further information as soon as available.”

The crashed A320 was 24 years old and had been with the parent Lufthansa group since 1991, according to the online database airfleets.net."

Gogo Looks to Delta Pressure For Help With Its Airbus Problem - Skift Travel News,"Thu, 12 Mar 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMTUvMDMvMTIvZ29nby1sb29rcy10by1kZWx0YS1wcmVzc3VyZS1mb3ItaGVscC13aXRoLWl0cy1haXJidXMtcHJvYmxlbS_SAV9odHRwczovL3NraWZ0LmNvbS8yMDE1LzAzLzEyL2dvZ28tbG9va3MtdG8tZGVsdGEtcHJlc3N1cmUtZm9yLWhlbHAtd2l0aC1pdHMtYWlyYnVzLXByb2JsZW0vYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Before Gogo's Smagley spoke, Global Eagle Entertainment's Kevin Trosian mentioned that ""the airline industry is very much a relationship industry."" Gogo seems to be having some problems with its Airbus relationship.

As Gogo transitions from air-to-ground technology to its satellite-based solutions, things seem to be going fine with Boeing but Airbus “is a little tougher to work with.”

That’s the view of Gogo CFO Norman Smagley, who addressed the subject at the Piper Jaffray Technology, Media and Telecommunications Conference in New York City March 11.

The issue revolves around “line-fitting,” meaning having manufacturers such as Boeing and Airbus pre-install Gogo in-flight Wi-Fi connectivity in new aircraft as they roll off assembly lines.

While Boeing is line-fitting aircraft for Gogo’s satellite offerings, Gogo is counting on Delta Air Lines to put some heavy pressure on Airbus to do likewise.

Delta and Gogo recently announced that Gogo would be upgrading Delta planes flying long-haul domestic, Latin America and Caribbean routes from air-to-ground-based wi-fi to Gogo’s 2KU satellite system.

Smagley said “one of the other great things about the Delta announcement” is that the upgrade not only involves more than 250 North American-based aircraft but also covers another 50 international aircraft, “a chunk of which is Airbus.”

“And they (Delta) will be bringing us to Airbus and demanding line-fit,” Smagley said. “So that will get us over the hump with Airbus, which will also be very helpful.”

Pricing Evolution

In other matters, as Gogo builds up its capacity, pricing changes should be coming both in the short and long term.

Smagley envisions a day when Gogo generates $1 million of revenue per year per aircraft. While managing revenue and margin, Gogo will offer pricing to enhance the take rate rather than inhibit it, he said.

Gogo sometimes increases pricing when demand exceeds capacity, but pricing will likely come down as Gogo can handle more capacity.

In fact, Smagley compared the evolution of in-flight Wi-Fi with what he said is the way that telecom companies reduced wireless pricing when they upgraded from 3G to 4G etc.

Said Smagley: “We can imagine a similar dynamic in the air.”"

Airbus Helicopters’ presence at this year’s Heli-Expo showcased the company’s customer-focused transformation, with the unveiling its all-new H160 mid-sized rotorcraft, the introduction of the company’s enhanced customer services offer, and the announcement of new orders for operators in the U.S. and Europe.

The H160’s reveal on opening day was the most anticipated event at Heli-Expo 2015 in the Orange County Convention Center at Orlando, Florida, and attracting a worldwide audience via live on-line streaming coverage.

With its distinctive styling – which includes sleek airframe profiling, the all-new Biplane Stabilizer, highly swept Blue Edge main rotor blades, and a double-canted tail incorporating the largest-ever Fenestron shrouded tail rotor – the H160’s highly refined look ushered in a new era of rotorcraft design and operational efficiency.

First flight of the H160 is planned later this year, followed by a targeted service entry beginning in 2018 for such mission applications as oil and gas operations; public services, air medical and coast guard duties; along with commercial transport, private and business aviation.

“Airbus Helicopters’ priorities of customer satisfaction, quality and safety, and competitiveness have been our drivers of success for this year’s show,” said Guillaume Faury, president and CEO of Airbus Helicopters. “Our teams are proud and excited to have introduced to the industry the H160, a helicopter which is a perfect example of what we mean when we say if it is important to our customers, it is essential to us.”"
Real life evacuation not needed for 195-seat A320 approval: Airbus - Runway Girl Network,"Fri, 27 Mar 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTUvMDMvcmVhbC1saWZlLWV2YWN1YXRpb24tbm90LW5lZWRlZC1mb3ItMTk1LXNlYXQtYTMyMC1hcHByb3ZhbC1haXJidXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As passengers we might not relish the idea that seating on the Airbus A320 is poised to get even tighter now that EASA has agreed a path forward for airlines to add a whopping two-and-a-half more seat rows to the narrowbody. After all, no matter how airlines spin it, we know that more seats equals less living space for those of us who fly in regular economy class. But are there safety implications to squeezing 15 more seats into an aircraft that was originally certified for 180 passengers?

Airbus and EASA don’t seem to think so, as the former was able to convince the latter to re-certify the A320 for 189-seats by adding a larger exit door, and widening the evacuation slides. Adding yet another six seats to the narrowbody for a total 195 seats, as recently approved by EASA, will – like any new airline customer cabin layout – require certification “and when that includes a substantial novelty a specific approval from the authorities would be required”, Airbus senior manager media relations trade & technical press Martin Fendt tells RGN.

“We expect this will be the case for a LOPA [layout of passenger accommodations] of 195 seats. That approval will be sought when such a LOPA has been identified for future delivery,” he adds.

Moreover, the airframer says it can demonstrate evacuation of a 195-seater in the required 90 seconds through simulation – i.e. no physical evacuation test with real live people will be necessary. “We believe we can demonstrate the evacuation capacity by analysis based on the tests already conducted to justify the increased credit and also tests results from the original A320 evacuation test. This is the typical approach and means that a new demonstration is not required,” says Fendt.

The fact that a physical demo won’t be required doesn’t sit well with some flyers, who believe regulators on both sides of the pond are moving too quickly to certify high-capacity LOPAs by simply requiring simulation tests.

“Watch what happens in the real world when [passengers of size and] old people try to get out carrying their bags of medicine! The current race to squeeze more and more seats into a finite space is plain stupidity. It will take a forced landing followed by a major fire that kills most of the passengers to change the situation,” suggests photographer and graphic designer Ian Hodgkiss.

“Until comfort and safety return, I will only fly when absolutely necessary. Paying money to be subjected to this type of pain and the risk of DVT from lack of fresh air really is starting to make me think again about going on holiday by air.”

He’s certainly not alone in his concerns.

We recently asked the US FAA if it is conducting any fresh studies into passenger egress in the event of an emergency in light of the now very cramped seating conditions on some aircraft – such as the 10-abreast Boeing 777 and 9-abreast A330 (with seats being pitched much closer together, seats being added to rows, and aisles being narrowed to accommodate the additional seats). Agency spokesman Les Dorr responded, “If the number of seats increases beyond what the airplane was originally certificated for, evacuation capability must be shown by demonstration or analysis.”

He notes that minimum passenger aisle width is regulated by 14 CFR 25.815. Access to emergency exits is in 25.813, and the number of passenger seats allowed is determined by the number and types of exits, 25.807(g).

Of course, there are also passenger comfort concerns to consider when packing aircraft to the gills. For instance, will airlines need to reduce seat pitch to 27 inches – a full one inch tighter than the traditional 28-inch standard minimum – to achieve a 195-seat LOPA on the A320?

Airbus isn’t saying just yet. “We are always working on space efficiency enablers, and it is too early for us to predict which of them will be used first to enable higher seat counts,” notes Fendt.

However, we know aircraft seat makers have developed 27-inch pitched models, and stand ready to provide these seats to airlines.

One area under study by the FAA is worth highlighting, however. A recent spate of aircraft emergency evacuations have shone the spotlight on the fact that passengers are flagrantly ignoring flight attendant instructions and grabbing their bags from the overhead bins before deplaning via the slides. This slows up the evacuation process, and could ultimately prove deadly.

“Luggage retrieval has always been an issue,” agrees Dorr. “It comes down to passenger education, which is one of our ongoing and primary research topics. We are testing a new serious games app that is geared toward passenger awareness and education about safety and survival in emergency situations.”

The app, featured on RGN in January, seeks to recapture passengers’ attention and retention of safety briefings."

news by Terry Spruce 9 March 2015 Print this page

Airbus Helicopters unveiled its brand new ‘H Generation’ series of helicopters starting with the H160 at Heli-Expo in Orlando last week, having rebranded its entire product line.

The H160 launch was revealed on the opening day of the show in the Orange County Convention Center.

Airbus Helicopters released a short video on the new H160, outlining everything that customers need to know.

The first flight of the H160 is planned later this year, followed by an entry into service in 2018.

Guillaume Faury, president and CEO of Airbus Helicopters, said: “Airbus Helicopters’ priorities of customer satisfaction, quality and safety, and competitiveness have been our drivers of success for this year’s show. Our teams are proud and excited to have introduced to the industry the H160, a helicopter which is a perfect example of what we mean when we say if it is important to our customers, it is essential to us.”

Also announced at the show was the news that The Bristow Group had tripled its orders for Airbus Helicopters’ H175. Deliveries will begin to Bristow in October 2016 for deployment in oil and gas operations.

Orders were place for four H135 helicopters. Norsk Luftambulanse AS signed an order for three H135s – adding to its emergency medical airlift operations in Norway and Denmark – and DL Helicopter Technik signed for one H135 to be used for amy and air force pilot training in Germany.

Airbus Helicopters displayed on its booth the H145 for Dare County MedFlight, the North Carolina-based medical service provider that is the US launch customer for the H145 T2 variant.

Also announced at Heli-Expo was the completion of the first H125 (formally the AS350) in the US, performed on the Airbus Helicopters final assembly line in Columbus, Mississippi.

This new re-designated helicopter is now in completion prior to delivery. During the show, Servicios Aéreos de los Andes signed for three H125s (one firm order with the option of two more) for utility work in Peru.

Airbus Helicopters also displayed a gold-themed H130 to celebrate the Papillon Group’s golden 50th anniversary. Papillon Group is the world’s largest and longest-operating aerial tour operator."

Airbus Helicopters Inc. is planning a multi-city tour across the U.S. this spring demonstrating the next generation air medical service capabilities of its EC130 T2 (now known as the H130 T2). United Rotorcraft, a division of Air Methods, will be completing the Airbus H130 T2 for the tour, equipping the aircraft with a state-of-the-art, next generation medical interior and avionics suite.

Since it was launched in 2012, the popular H130 T2 has been utilized for a variety of purposes, including tourism and firefighting. The first H130 T2 was introduced into U.S. air medical service in February by Enloe Medical Center’s FlightCare Program.

Now in its 30th year of providing air ambulance service, Chico, Calif.-based Enloe selected the H130 T2 for its safety features, redundant aircraft systems and all-in-one digital technology, as well as the roomy cabin that provides more comfort for patients, better patient access for the crew, and room for new medical equipment.

The H130 T2 succeeds its predecessor, the EC130 B4, as one of the most highly successful single engine helicopters in air medical service. Improvements in power, performance, ride comfort and speed enhance air medical transport operations. The H130 T2 has been so well received by Enloe that Airbus Helicopters Inc. decided to take an identically equipped aircraft on tour to demonstrate the aircraft’s air medical service capabilities.

“The H130 T2 is the next generation single-engine aircraft that can provide both high performance and lower costs for the air medical industry,” said Treg Manning, vice president, sales and marketing for Airbus Helicopters Inc. “The T2 provides a more accessible and roomier working environment and unparalleled flexibility in equipment configuration, not to mention upgraded safety features that are standard with this helicopter We are excited about the upcoming tour and the opportunity to showcase this aircraft to our friends in the air medical industry.”

United Rotorcraft’s newly FAA-approved medical interior includes the Lowered Patient Loading System (LPLS) to easily load and secure critically injured patients and neonatal isolettes during transport. On board medical systems include 10 Liter Liquid Oxygen (LOX), integrated compressed air, suction, and tailored mounts to accommodate carry-on medical equipment as well as an abundance of AC power.

“The Airbus Helicopters EC130 T2 will be a popular platform for the helicopter air ambulance industry. We are proud to partner with Airbus Helicopters to demonstrate this aircraft and showcase our highly capable EMS interior for the market,” said Mike Slattery, president, United Rotorcraft.

With the largest cabin of any single engine helicopter in its class — 54 percent greater unobstructed cabin volume than the Bell 407 — and wide, sliding doors, the medical crew can remain in continuous contact with the patient, providing for improved care. Available in numerous EMS configurations, the H130 T2 has 143 percent more baggage space than the Bell 407, allowing medical staff to carry a wider range of specialty equipment.

The H130 offers better power margins and range than competing models, particularly in hot and high conditions. Safety features include a factory installed Vision 1000 flight data recorder and a cabin design with crash worthy seats. Lower direct maintenance costs provide operators with improved economics."
Arianespace selected by Airbus Defence and Space to launch EDRS-C satellite - Arianespace,"Thu, 19 Mar 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyaWFuZXNwYWNlLmNvbS9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlL2FyaWFuZXNwYWNlLXNlbGVjdGVkLWJ5LWFpcmJ1cy1kZWZlbmNlLWFuZC1zcGFjZS10by1sYXVuY2gtZWRycy1jLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The EDRS-C satellite launch services agreement signing is marked by Arianespace Chairman and CEO Stéphane Israël (left) and Evert Dudok, Head of the Communications, Intelligence and Security Business Line at Airbus Defence and Space.

The second SpaceDataHighway stationary satellite will be launched on Ariane 5

Arianespace and Airbus Defence and Space have reached an agreement for the launch of EDRS-C which is the second geostationary satellite of the SpaceDataHighway system. The launch is scheduled for first quarter in 2017. EDRS-C will increase the system capacity and provide redundancy for the SpaceDataHighway. Its orbital position will be 31 East.

Like optical fibre on the Earth, the EDRS system, which is also referred to as SpaceDataHighway, will provide laser communications in Space with data rates of up to 1.8 Gigabits per second. The SpaceDataHighway will provide near-realtime data transfer from Earth observation satellites, drones or aircrafts to Earth via Geostationary communication satellites. It will be able to download faster and in a secure way, larger volumes of image data, helping to improve environmental and security monitoring, disaster response and crisis management

EDRS-C is a dedicated satellite, unlike EDRS-A which is a hosted payload on the EUTELSAT 9B satellite. EDRS-C will carry amongst others the EDRS payload which main component is the Laser Communication Terminal built by Airbus Defence and Space’s subsidiary, TESAT enabling data transfer rates of up to 1.8Gbps.

“The SpaceDataHighway establishes a new standard for space communication,” said Evert Dudok, Head of Communications, Intelligence and Security (CIS) Business Line, Airbus Defence and Space. “We are satisfied to launch EDRS-C on Ariane 5, the most reliable launcher in the World.”

“Arianespace is very proud to have been chosen by Airbus Defence and Space to launch EDRS C,” said Arianespace Chairman and CEO Stéphane Israël. “We are grateful to Airbus Defence and Space for this decision which allows Arianespace to be part of this innovative European public private partnership.”

The successful tests recently achieved between Alphasat and Sentinel 1 satellites have proved that the laser technology developed by Airbus Defence and Space is now fully operational. The SpaceDataHighway will be operational early 2016 following the launch of the first node, EDRS-A, planned to be launched in summer 2015.

The SpaceDataHighway programme is developed and implemented within Public Private Partnership (PPP) between the European Space Agency and Airbus Defence and Space. As prime, Airbus Defence and Space builds, owns, operates and co-finances the system’s infrastructure. The German Space Agency, DLR, also plays a key role in the funding of EDRS and in the development and the operation of the ground segment. 50 companies in 13 European countries are involved in the EDRS consortium, allowing European space industry to stay at cutting edge of technology.

Emirates Airbus A380 Superjumbo - Business Insider,"Tue, 10 Mar 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vZW1pcmF0ZXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtc3VwZXJqdW1iby0yMDE1LTPSAUpodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2VtaXJhdGVzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLXN1cGVyanVtYm8tMjAxNS0zP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Emirates is not only the A380's biggest customer, it can be argued that the airline is the superjumbo's only customer that matters.

And what the customer wants, the customer gets. At least that's what Emirates is hoping for.

Emirates wants an A380 ""neo"" — a superjumbo with newer, more fuel-efficient engines.

(""Neo"" is the designation that Airbus gives to aircraft models that have had their engines and aerodynamics upgraded.)

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

As Business Insider reported last September, Emirates' CEO Tim Clark said the airline could order another 60-70 non-neo superjumbos, valued at a whopping $29 billion, if a new engine option becomes available.

Then in January at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the outspoken airline boss upped that figure to 100 superjumbos with a value of $43 billion, Bloomberg reported.

Now, according to the Wall Street Journal, that number has doubled to as many as 200 superjumbos or roughly $86 billion based on Airbus' 2015 catalogue prices.

Even though Clark essentially told Airbus that ""if you build it, we will buy it,"" in a January interview with Bloomberg TV, Airbus is still on the fence as to whether it will commit the years of development and billions of dollars to produce a new version of the A380.

While acknowledging Clark's experience and accomplishments, Airbus sales chief John Leahy told reporters at the annual conference of the International Society of Transport Aircraft Trading in Phoenix that the decision to produce an updated A380 will be built around sound business reasoning — and won't be taken by just one airline.

But what a customer Emirates has been for the A380!

Although some airlines have had a hard time filling the seats on the massive double-decker plane, Emirates doesn't seem to be one of them.

According to Bloomberg, flights on the airline's fleet of A380s are putting money in the bank. Routes to popular destinations, such as London, are operating at 90% capacity. Emirates is also increasing A380 flights on its US and South Asia routes.

Clark believes upgraded engines could save his airline 10-13% in costs.

This latest development should comes as welcome news to the Airbus superjumbo program.

In short, the A380 is struggling.

Airbus didn't sell a single superjumbo to an airline in 2014. And Amedeo, the leasing company that did buy 20 A380s in 2014, can't seem to find anybody to rent them to.

Struggling A380 operator Malaysia Airlines recently leased a pair of superjumbo to Turkish Airlines as part of a trial program to see if the plane can be a reasonable fit for the Istanbul-based carrier. While that's good news for the A380 program, there are no promises that Turkish Airlines won't return the planes to Malaysia at the end of the loan.

Fortunately, Airbus has Emirates. Of the 317 A380s ever ordered, 140 of them have been by the official airline of Dubai.

And of the 154 aircraft that have actually been delivered, 58 have gone to Emirates. The airline has even agreed to take delivery of its A380s early, in order to give Amedeo more time to find customers willing to lease the superjumbo.

Which makes Emirates a critical partner in the future of the A380. If Airbus wants to keep its superjumbo program going, it's going to need Emirates.

And what about that $86 billion price tag?

That's just the sticker price. With Emirates quite literally flying the plane on the deal, don't expect Tim Clark's airline to pay anything more than a fraction of that amount.

Under the circumstances, that would be a great outcome for both parties."
Airbus Helicopters debuts H160 mid-sized helicopter - AOPA,"Tue, 03 Mar 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFvcGEub3JnL25ld3MtYW5kLW1lZGlhL2FsbC1uZXdzLzIwMTUvbWFyY2gvMDMvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLWRlYnV0cy1oMTYwLW1pZC1zaXplZC1oZWxpY29wdGVy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters debuts H160 mid-sized helicopter

Airbus Helicopters debuted a year ago at the Helicopter Association International show as a rebranding of the former Eurocopter products. A flashy corporate video in front of thousands of attendees on the Heli-Expo exhibit hall floor kicked off the spectacle as a black drape fell to reveal a full-scale mockup of the sleek all-composite H160, which features new Blue Edge main rotor blades. The company claims the swept tips reduced exterior noise levels by 50 percent and allow an increased gross weight compared to traditional blades. The tail section carries the largest Fenestron shrouded tail rotor ever produced and the Airbus Biplane Stabilizer, a staggered placement of dual-level, interconnected stabilizers. The design improves low-speed and hover performance.

The “Splash of the Day” award for the opening day of Heli-Expo 2015 in Orlando must surely go to Airbus Helicopters for its big reveal of the H160 mid-sized helicopter. The new twin Turbomeca-powered helicopter is the first developed by the company under its new brand.

The lightweight composite fuselage, the first ever in a commercial helicopter, combined with the 1,100 shaft horsepower Arrano engine promises a 15- to 20-percent improvement in fuel burn, allowing the 160-knot ship to carry 12 passengers up to 120 nautical miles or, with full fuel, to marathon out to 450 nm with a 20-minute reserve. The former mission is ideal for offshore oil rig ops, the latter an ideal profile for public service and search-and-rescue missions.

Airbus originally announced the project back in 2011 and suggested there would be two different engine options, one of which would be Pratt & Whitney. More recently, when the company decided it needed more horsepower, Pratt & Whitney was dropped from the option list and Turbomeca became standard.

The H160 will begin “bench flying” in March and is expected to enter into service in 2018.

Among the tasks under the new Airbus Helicopters brand was to consolidate and simplify the product line’s naming structure. The various and confusing product names came about because of a series of mergers going back decades. In the 1990s, Germany’s MBB and France’s Aerospatiale merged to form Eurocopter. The combined product lines led to plenty of confusing names, some of them hybrids of both companies, such as EC130, AS365 N3+, AS565 MBE, EC135 T3/P3, EC145 T2, and then, simply the Tiger. Tour operators in particular had come to love the AStar and TwinStar names, which the company assures you can continue to use even though the models now uniformly begin with an H—something else learned from Airbus, which makes airplanes that have product names that logically begin with A, such as the A320 and the A380. So now from Airbus Helicopters, look for products called the H120, the H130, the H135, and so on. Military variants will append an M to the end of the model name, such as the H725M.

Meanwhile, Airbus Helicopters President and CEO Guillaume Faury is focused on leveraging the safety expertise that is part of the culture on the airplane side of the operation. All new helicopters will have safety as an underpinning of development, he assured. To that end, the company has introduced a flight crew operations manual for H225 customers with FCOMs coming for other models soon—an industry first, according to Faury. The manuals for standardized operations are developed in conjunction with customers and industry, he said.

Confident in the new emphasis on safety and performance, the company also introduced extended warranties on new products, three years or 2,000 hours with labor included for the first year."

But Markus Wahl of the German pilots union Cockpit says it most likely wasn’t a safety issue.

Deutsche Welle: Several pilots and crew members have refused to fly in the wake of the crash of the Germanwings Airbus A320. Is that partly out of protest against Lufthansa, which they perhaps fear is cutting corners on safety due to its difficult economic situation?

Markus Wahl: I haven't spoken with every single colleague, and I certainly can't speak for all of those colleagues, but Germanwings is a small airline. Many of the pilots and crew who have to fly now would have known the victims. It's like losing a good friend or a good acquaintance, and it's only natural that they are very emotional right now. I doubt that it's the best time for these people to be flying planes. I personally think it's a very responsible decision to say, “if I'm not able to give 100 percent, then I'd rather not fly a plane.”

Would you say that budget airlines aren't safe, or at least, not as safe as major airlines?

With respect to the pilots, I can tell you that they were both Lufthansa pilots. They went to the Lufthansa flight school, they were trained by Lufthansa. So I would definitely not support the claim that flying with a low cost airline such as Germanwings is less safe.

Is a 24-year-old plane considered to be an old plane?

No, with planes, you can't assume that it's less safe, just because it's older; it's not the same as with cars. After 15 years, you could quite rightly call a car a rust bucket. It's very different with planes. They are constantly being maintained, and every few years they're taken apart and important parts are exchanged. So that kind of age for a plane is nothing out of the ordinary.

Image: Vereinigung Cockpit e.V.

We still don't know what caused the accident. It could be that the crash had to do with a problem with the autopilot. The automatic technology in a plane is generally beneficial. But in what situations can autopilot be dangerous?

Autopilot can be dangerous when you don't have the ability to turn it off in the event that it's not working properly. But in an Airbus A320, you can always override the autopilot if you see that something is wrong. And then, like in any other plane, you can fly it manually and land it safely.

Are there different safety standards in place at Lufthansa than at its budget subsidiary, Germanwings?

Lufthansa technicians carry out the maintenance on Germanwings planes. The pilots were trained by Lufthansa, so I wouldn't say that there are any differences here. It's a Lufthansa subsidiary, that's true, but despite that, the safety measures are equally high.

Are they maintained as regularly as Lufthansa planes?

In terms of aircraft maintenance, how often planes are checked and which maintenance checks are carried out are very clearly regulated by law. These apply to Lufthansa, and they also apply to Germanwings. So there can't be any differences.

Lufthansa and Cockpit are currently at odds. Recently, pilots have been on strike, and there have been harsh words from both sides. Will the pilots union be making any additional demands of Lufthansa now after this disaster?

It's true that in the pay dispute, both sides have taken a very hard line. We don't see eye to eye on a number of issues. But right now, we're coping with a tragic accident, and so the conflict over pay and conditions has taken a back seat. For us, the dispute with management is not the main issue. Co-workers and passengers have died, and that's the focus right now. The contract bargaining can wait.

Markus Wahl is the deputy spokesman of the Cockpit pilots union.

The plane involved in the Germanwings crash in France, the Airbus A320, is known as a relatively safe aircraft and is a workhorse of the fleet that is comparable to the Boeing 737.

The A320 family of planes — which includes the 321, 319 and 318 — had 0.14 fatal accidents for every million flights, according to a Boeing study of crashes from 1959 through 2013. That rate was similar to 0.11 for new models of the 737 and one-sixth of the 0.89 rate for early models of the 737, according to the study.

The plane has been involved in several high-profile crashes, though.

In January 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 struck geese while taking off from New York's LaGuardia airport and ditched in the Hudson River. Everyone survived.

Overseas, Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 crashed in bad weather in the Java Sea in December 2014. The cause is under investigation.

About 3,660 of the A320 are in operation worldwide, according to Airbus. The A320 family is a popular single-aisle aircraft, with 6,200 flying worldwide.

The planes have flown 150 million flight hours in 85 million flights, according to Airbus. The company says it has orders to build an additional 10,500 planes in the A320 family.

""We have been informed of an accident involving an A320 family aircraft and all efforts are now going towards assessing the situation,"" Airbus said in a statement. ""We will provide further information as soon as available.""

Statement from Flight Safety Foundation president and CEO,

Jon Beatty, CEO of the Flight Safety Foundation, an industry group that studies aviation safety, said Germanwings hadn't had a major accident before Tuesday's crash.

""We expect that the investigators from the French and German authorities will find the black boxes and the cause of this tragedy will be determined quickly,"" Beatty said.

The Germanwings aircraft was produced in 1991 and delivered to the parent airline Lufthansa, according to Airbus. The plane has been flown 58,300 hours in about 46,700 flights, the company said.

Airbus said advisers will be dispatched to assist the French crash investigation.

""The concerns and sympathy of the Airbus employees go to the families, friends and loved ones affected by the accident,"" Airbus said in a statement."

CERES, which stands for Capacité de REnseignement Electromagnétique Spatiale, is due to enter service around 2020. The three satellites are to be closely positioned in orbit, and work together to detect and locate ground signals.

Airbus and Thales are the prime contractors. Airbus will handle the space satellite segment of the project while Thales is responsible for the payload and the user ground segment. The two manufacturers are the joint prime contractors for the entire system. In addition, Thales Alenia Space acts as a subcontractor to Airbus Defense and Space in supplying the platform.

An Airbus A320-211 operated by Germanwings — a low cost subsidiary of Germany's Lufthansa — crashed in the French Alps on Tuesday.

Germanwings flight 9525 was flying from Barcelona, Spain to Dusseldorf, Germany when the aircraft experienced a sudden loss of altitude.

All 150 passengers and crew on boards are believed to have perished. Reuters reported that there were three Americans on the flight.

While both ""black boxes"" have been found, it could be months or years before we know what caused the Airbus to go down.

""Everyone wants to come up with some sort of possible cause, and there’s no way to do that. It could be one of a thousand things,"" airline pilot and author of the book ""Cockpit Confidential"" Patrick Smith told Business Insider.

Here's what we do know. The Airbus A320 is one of the most advanced, popular, and durable airliners in the world. With more than 11,500 sold and 6,200 planes in services, the A320 series is arguably Airbus' greatest success. With just 23 fatal incidents in a quarter century of flying, the 320 has an excellent service history.

This was Germanwings first fatal accident since the airline's founding in 1997. Parent company Lufthansa hasn't had a fatal crash in more than two decades.

""Lufthansa and Germanwings both have great safety records,"" aviation expert and founder of NYCAviation Phil Derner, Jr. said. ""They've taken great steps to maintain a high level of safety.""

Although the aircraft involved in the incident required maintenance twice in the two days prior to the crash, Lufthansa's CEO assured the public that the Airbus flew with a clean bill of health each time it took off.

Airbus A320 Safety

In fact, the European aviation system ranks as one of the most congested, and yet safest, in the world. With more than 30,000 flights per day covering 21 million nautical miles, accidents remain exceedingly rare.

None of this means that safety or a problem with the plane won't be identified as a factor in the crash. Authorities are perplexed, the New York Times reported, about the lack of communication between the plane's pilots and air traffic controllers during the relatively slow, 10-minute descent that preceded the A320's crash.

Story continues

The plane's cockpit voice recorder was also damaged in the impact, potentially limiting investigators' ability to reconstruct the events of the accident.

"German Airbus A320 Crashes in Alps, French President Says No Survivors - PEOPLE","Tue, 24 Mar 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS9jZWxlYnJpdHkvZ2VybWFuLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIwLWNyYXNoZXMtaW4tYWxwcy1mcmVuY2gtcHJlc2lkZW50LXNheXMtbm8tc3Vydml2b3JzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A German passenger plane carrying 148 people has crashed in southern France while en route from Barcelona to Düsseldorf, according to multiple reports.

French president Fran ois Hollande said Tuesday that he fears the worst after the Airbus A320, operated by Lufthansa’s Germanwings budget airline, went down in the French Alps.

“There were 148 people on board,” he said in a statement. “The conditions of the accident, which have not yet been clarified, lead us to think there are no survivors … The accident happened in a zone that is particularly hard to access.”

The local newspaper, La Provence, said the plane was carrying 142 passengers, two pilots and four cabin crew.

The wreckage has been located at a site near Barcelonette (about 8,850 feet above sea level) and is scattered over an estimated 4½ square acres. In a race against severe weather, authorities are rushing in 210 police and three columns of fire-rescue squads. By later afternoon Tuesday it is anticipated that search helicopters will need to be grounded when a storm expected to bring 40-m.p.h. winds will make the site completely inaccessible until Wednesday afternoon.

Some 16 students from a village outside Düsseldorf, returning with two professors from an exchange year in Spain, are believed to be among the victims, according to reports.

French officials confirmed that the plane’s black box has been located and its contents will be promptly examined. Images of the crash site also began to surface Tuesday, showing the debris spread out across a remote section of the Alps.

News reports say that the aircraft disappeared from the radar shortly after 11 a.m. local time, and a police helicopter saw a column of smoke in the area about 15 minutes later.

In a statement posted to the Lufthansa Twitter account, CEO Carsten Spohr said: “We do not yet know what has happened to flight 4U 9525. My deepest sympathy goes to the families and friends of our passengers and crew on 4U 9525. If our fears are confirmed, this is a dark day for Lufthansa. We hope to find survivors.”

Aviation websites were reporting that the plane experienced a rapid descent and that the last words from the cockpit were: “Emergency, emergency.”

The Guardian and others are releasing updates about the crash as they happen.

The crash site in the southern French Alps is extremely difficult to reach and inaccessible to vehicles, according to locals.

“It is extremely steep,” said the mayor of neighboring village Seyne-les-Alpes, Francis Hermitte. “It is only accessible by helicopter. The only other way is to walk, which takes hours.”

An official at that village’s City Hall, eight miles from the crash site, tells PEOPLE: “[The] weather was good in the region, there were clouds overhead but no snowfall. It’s mountainous, though, and very difficult to reach.”

The crash site is in a compact 1.3-square-mile area.

How An Airbus Cockpit Locking Mechanism Works [Video] - Popular Science,"Thu, 26 Mar 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHNjaS5jb20vaG93LWxvY2tpbmctbWVjaGFuaXNtcy13b3JrLWFpcmJ1cy1jb2NrcGl0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Speculation abounds this morning over what brought down Germanwings Flight 4U 9525, which crashed into the French Alps on Tuesday. The Airbus A320 plane, en route to Düsseldorf from Barcelona, had just reached a cruising altitude of 38,000 feet when it began descending unexpectedly. Eight minutes later, it crashed into a mountainside.

Clues are emerging as to what might have caused the crash, and it now seems the accident wasn’t an accident at all. At a televised news conference in Paris this morning, chief Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin, who is leading the investigation, painted a rather eerie picture of the moments leading up to the crash. The flight recordings suggest the captain (whose name hasn’t been officially released) left the cockpit to use the restroom but couldn’t get back in. He gently knocked, then banged on the door. However, his pleas were met with silence by the co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz, who was still inside and may have deliberately activated the plane’s descent.

Robin cited other unnerving evidence, including the co-pilot’s steady and normal breathing up until the moment of impact, calling into question the idea that he might have suffered a medical episode.

What’s known about the cockpit door locking mechanism also suggests a voluntary act. Quartz found this video, which walks through Airbus reinforced door procedures:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixEHV7c3VXs?

Since 9/11, the aviation industry has made substantial changes to how a person can enter a cockpit. Specifically, Airbus–the manufacturer of the Germanwings-operated jetplane–modified their vehicles so the cockpit door remains locked at all times. If someone wants to enter the cockpit, such as a flight attendant, he or she must request access through an electronic communications system. The pilots can then open the door by flipping a switch to the unlock position.

But suppose, for a moment, that both the pilot and co-pilot became unconscious and couldn’t open the cockpit door. In this scenario, a flight attendant can punch a code into a keypad outside the door, alerting the crew inside that it’s about to unlock in the next 30 seconds or so. During this time anyone inside the cockpit can override the unlock function. “The locking devices on the latest planes can override that code assuming a hijacker found out the code,” Vernon Grose, a former investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board and former scientist for the Federal Aviation Administration, tells Popular Science.

This override feature has aviation experts suspecting the Germanwings co-pilot crashed the plane on purpose. Presumably, the locked-out pilot would have entered the unlock code into the keypad to get back inside the cockpit. And, barring a malfunction with keypad override, the door should have opened after roughly half a minute. Given that both a malfunction and a co-pilot medical emergency happening at the same time seems highly unlikely, an intentional act on the part of the co-pilot is, at this point, the most likely explanation.

“Everything has a plus and a minus when it comes to technology”

According to Grose, this scenario demonstrates a faulty “failure mode and effects analysis.” Such an analysis is conducted every time manufacturers put a new safety technology into an airplane. The goal: Determine all the cases in which the technology might fail. In this instance, either the aviation industry didn’t consider a situation in which a pilot might use the technology with malicious intent, or they considered it to be an extremely unlikely occurrence, figuring the benefits of such technology (preventing hijackings) outweighed the cons (enabling hijackings).

“Everything has a plus and a minus when it comes to technology,” Grose says. “The locking device is wonderful on one side if someone bad is trying to get in. But it’ll keep someone good out who needs to be in there.”

Grose and other aviation experts agree it’s too early to speculate on future countermeasures to thwart a cockpit-locking hijack, especially since information from the investigation is incomplete. However, if it does come to light that the co-pilot was at fault, it’s possible there will be some regulatory changes–in regard to how cockpit doors function, how background checks on pilots are done, or both."

Airbus Helicopters unveils its all-new H160 as the benchmark for medium-class rotorcraft - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 03 Mar 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1c2hlbGljb3B0ZXJzdW52ZWlsc2l0c2FsbG5ld2gxNjBhc3RoZWJlbmNobWFya2Zvcm1lZGl1bS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In one of the industry’s most anticipated events, Airbus Helicopters today presented its all-new H160, raising the standards for performance, cost effectiveness, passenger comfort and environmental impact to create the medium-class rotorcraft benchmark.

As the first product introduced with the Airbus Helicopters corporate identity and its new numbering designation, this 5.5-6-ton-class rotorcraft’s nose-to-tail breakthroughs in design and systems exemplify the company’s transformation plan that puts customer satisfaction and operational safety first.

Airbus Helicopters unveiled the twin-engine H160 at the Heli-Expo industry show’s opening in Orlando, Florida, where a full-scale representative model is being displayed on the company’s exhibit stand (Booth #2437).

“The H160 represents Airbus Helicopters’ strategy to provide the most efficient solutions for our customers, who serve, protect, save lives and safely carry passengers in the most demanding environments,” said President Guillaume Faury. “We are driven by this mission, because what is important to our customers is essential to us.'”

The H160 brings form and function together in a highly stylized rotorcraft, which integrates as many as 68 different Airbus Helicopters-patented technologies. Its payload lift, range and efficiency make this helicopter ideally suited for a wide variety of uses, including oil and gas operations; public services, air medical and coast guard duties; along with commercial transport, private and business aviation.

With a cruise speed of 160 kts., the H160 can carry 12 passengers at distances of up to 120 NM. for oil and gas missions, and a 450-NM range with 20-minute reserve in public service or search and rescue tasks.

The distinctive design of the H160 includes two Airbus Helicopter firsts, both offering improved performance and flight stability: the largest-ever Fenestron® shrouded tail rotor, which is also double-canted at 12-deg. angles, further enhancing anti-torque control efficiency; and the all-new Biplane Stabilizer™, whose unique design involves a staggered placement of the dual-level, interconnected stabilizers. This feature facilitates pilot maneuvers and significantly reduces aerodynamic penalties in low-speed flight and hover.

An additional H160 technology breakthrough is Airbus Helicopters’ initial production use of its Blue Edge® main rotor blades, which reduce exterior noise levels by 50 percent (3 dB) and also allow a payload increase of up to 100 kg. when compared to traditional rotor blades, depending on flight conditions.

The H160 is the first-ever, fully-composite civil helicopter, resulting in an airframe that is lighter in weight, more robust, resistant to corrosion and fatigue, while requiring less maintenance. Airbus Helicopters’ proven Spheriflex bearingless main rotor hub is further enhanced with the application of innovative composite thermoplastic technology – which reduces weight and increases damage tolerance.

The H160’s integration of Airbus Helicopters’ Helionix® avionics marks its latest application of the first digital avionics suite to be fully designed and integrated by a rotorcraft manufacturer. Operators will benefit from the increased safety that Helionix® provides through reduced pilot workload, enhanced situational awareness, improved flight envelope protection and system redundancy. In service today on the EC175 and EC145 T2, Helionix® is an avionics family concept that enables software improvements to be integrated and retrofitted on the H160 as well as other helicopters in the company’s current, future and evolved product lines.

To power its H160, Airbus Helicopters has selected the new Turbomeca 1,100-shp. Arrano engine, which offers significant reductions in fuel consumption for improved range and payload performance, along with a reduced environmental footprint. An optimized maintenance concept designed to significantly decrease the need for on-site servicing will contribute to lower operational costs for the helicopter.

Additional features of the H160 include electric landing gear, requiring less maintenance while also allowing more payload to be carried; easy access to various maintenance areas, which was taken into consideration during the concurrent engineering process; along with flexibility in the maintenance plan to match operators’ needs and constraints thanks to the MSG-3 (Maintenance Steering Group-3) inspection methodology.

Airbus Helicopters has invested heavily in the H160 program to ensure efficiency throughout development. Three dedicated prototype aircraft are fully supported by two new ground-based integration test means that enable comprehensive validations of the various system integrations to ensure the highest levels of maturity before the H160’s first flight and shorten the entire development process. The Dynamic Helicopter Zero is a test bench fully representative of the rotorcraft’s dynamic systems, the main and tail rotor flight controls, along with hydraulic, electrical, avionics and health/usage monitoring systems whereas the System Helicopter Zero integrates the H160’s avionics, electrical harnesses, fuel system, hydraulics, flight controls, lighting and all key elements that are connected electrically and involve software.

Development of the H160 began in 2013, with the definition of the final aircraft configuration confirmed this year. The helicopter’s first flight will also take place in 2015 and service entry is planned for 2018.

As the first helicopter to be released under the new Airbus Helicopters identity which fully representative of the company’s core values of excellence, agility, unity and integrity, the H160 introduces the company’s new way of naming its product lines in line with its transformation. Consistent with the strategies utilized by Airbus, the “AS” and “EC” letters for in-production helicopters are replaced by “H.” Military versions will be identified with an “M” after the model name.

Airbus Defence and Space to produce warning system for new Korean Helicopter - Vertical Magazine,"Thu, 19 Mar 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1c2RlZmVuY2VhbmRzcGFjZXRvcHJvZHVjZXdhcm5pbmdzeXN0ZW1mb3JuZXdrb3JlYW5oZWxpYy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MILDS forward sensor heads, seen here in the NH90 configuration. Airbus Defence and Space Photo

Airbus Defence and Space is joining forces with Huneed Technologies Co. Ltd., Incheon/Republic of Korea, to provide the new Korean Utility Helicopter “Surion” with advanced missile warning systems. The companies signed a cooperation agreement aiming at Huneed Technologies to produce core electronics components of Airbus Defence and Space’s MILDS missile warning system (MILDS = Missile Launch Detection System).

Since 2007, Airbus Defence and Space had been awarded several contracts reaching a multi-million dollar figure by Korea’s Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) and Korea Aerospace Industries to develop and manufacture the missile warning system of the military helicopter “Surion” based on its proven MILDS system. Part of the production contract had been the set-up of a partnership with local industries which has now been put in place.

“Airbus Defence and Space follows a dedicated globalization and partnership strategy in a wider perspective”, said Thomas Müller, head of the Electronics Business Line of Airbus Defence and Space. “We are convinced that a close cooperation with local industries creates additional value for our customers.”

MILDS is a passive imaging sensor, detecting the UV radiation signature of approaching missiles. The extremely high resolution combined with rapid processing enables very reliable threat identification and virtually eliminates false alarms. Four to six sensors provide optimum coverage and rapid reaction. As MILDS operates in the UV spectrum, it is not subject to the limitations of other warning technologies such as infrared.

With more than 8,000 sensors sold, MILDS is the standard missile approach warner outside the U.S. It is in service aboard a huge variety of rotary wing and wide-body aircraft, including Tiger, NH90, CH-53, CH-47 and MI-17 helicopters and C-130 transport aircraft. A specific fighter version – MILDS F – is in service with the Royal Danish Air Force and Royal Norwegian Air Force F-16 fighters."

A Germanwings aircraft that has crashed in the French Alps is expected to have no survivors

An Airbus A320 operated by the Germanwings flight 9525, a budget subsidiary of German carrier Lufthansa, crashed Tuesday in the French Alps, apparently killing all 150 people on board, including 16 high school students from Germany.

French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said a black box has been located at plane crash site. It wasn't immediately clear if the box had been recovered.

The Associated Press cited regional official Eric Ciotti as saying wreckage from the plane had been discovered at Meolans-Revels, near a popular ski resort between the towns of Digne-les-Bains and Barcelonnette. The wreckage was believed to be on the side of a mountain, inaccessible by roads and covered in heavy snow.

AFP quoted a police officer in the town of Le Vernet, near the crash site, as saying: ""There is no need for any rescue operations, everyone is dead.""

Germanwings said the plane, which had been en route from Barcelona, Spain, to Dusseldorf, Germany, was carrying 144 passengers, two pilots and four crew members. An airline executive said two babies were believed to have been aboard the flight and CBS News' Heather Bosch confirms with a school administrator that 16 students and two teachers from Joseph-Koenig-Gymnasium High School from the German town of Haltern were on the plane.

""This is, of course, the worst thing you could imagine,"" Haltern Mayor Bodo Klimpel said.

French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said that a helicopter landed near the area where the plane went down, but the crew found no survivors.

""It is going to take days to recover the victims, then the debris,"" senior police officer Jean-Paul Bloy told Reuters.

Gilbert Sauvan, president of the general council of the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, told the Associate Press that ""everything is pulverized"" at the site of the crash.

""There is nothing left except debris and bodies"" tweeted local deputy Christophe Castaner after flying over the crash site with Cazeneuve.

The airline's managing director Oliver Wagner said Germanwings would do everything possible to determine what brought Flight 9525 down, but that he had no information on what might have caused the crash as of Tuesday afternoon.

""Our deep sympathy goes out to the relatives and friends of the victims,"" Wagner said.

French President Francois Hollande said search and rescue teams did not expect to find any survivors from the crash.

""It's a tragedy on our soil,"" the French leader said. He spoke on the phone later Tuesday to his German counterpart Angela Merkel, as he expected many of the victims of the crash were German.

Speaking in Germany, Merkel said she would fly herself to the crash site on Wednesday ""to talk with local authorities.""

CBS

""We all feel deeply saddened and our thoughts are with victims, relatives and loved ones,"" added Merkel.

Officials said 67 German nationals were believed to have been on the plane.

A spokesman for Spain's Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said there were at least 45 people on the plane ""with Spanish surnames,"" according to the Reuters news agency.

The U.S. was reviewing whether any American citizens were aboard the flight, according to State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki.

There was no immediate indication as to what might have caused the crash. Weather in the area was good at the time the plane went missing, but was taking a turn for the worst in the afternoon, raising fears that search and rescue efforts could be even further hampered.

The plane dropped from a normal cruising altitude of about 38,000 feet to just 10,000 or 11,000 feet in the space of only eight minutes before dropping off radar screens.

The plane never issued a distress call during its descent, France's aviation regulator said, according to Reuters.

""The aircraft did not itself make a distress call but it was the combination of the loss of radio contact and the aircraft's descent which led the controller to implement the distress phase,"" a spokesman for the DGAC authority said.

Pierre Polizzi, who owns a campsite near the crash site, told The Associated Press he heard two long noises around the time the Germanwings plane went down.

""There are often fighter jets flying over, so I thought it sounded just like that. I looked outside but I couldn't see any fighter planes,"" he said. ""The noise I heard was long -- like 8 seconds -- as if the plane was going more slowly than a military plane speed. There was another long noise about 30 seconds later.""

French Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet said the jet crashed in the mountains at an altitude of about 6,550 feet. Crews were struggling to access the crash location due to the rugged terrain.

Brandet told BFM television that he expected ""an extremely long and extremely difficult"" search and rescue operation because of the area's remoteness.

Bernadette Meehan, spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said that President Obama had been briefed on the crash and U.S. officials have offered assistance to French, German, and Spanish authorities.

""There is no indication of a nexus to terrorism at this time,"" Meehan said.

Airbus told CBS News in a statement that the manufacturer was ""aware of the media reports and all efforts are now going towards assessing the situation.""

The Airbus A320 is a workhorse of the short and medium-haul passenger aviation business. More than 3,000 of them are in daily operation with airlines around the world.

Both Germanwings and its parent company Lufthansa have strong safety records.

Germanwings boss Thomas Winkelmann told reporters Tuesday that the ill-fated aircraft was last given a routine safety check the day before the crash in Dusseldorf, by Lufthansa technicians. The last major maintenance check was conducted in the summer of 2013, in line with the proscribed timetable.

Winkelmann said the pilot in charge of flight 9525 had more than 10 years experience in the air, including more than 6,000 flight miles logged on Airbus aircraft."

Pilot who flew Barack Obama weighs in on Germanwings Airbus A320 disaster; offers insight on French Alps crash - New York Daily News,"Tue, 24 Mar 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueWRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wMy8yNC9waWxvdC13aG8tZmxldy1iYXJhY2stb2JhbWEtd2VpZ2hzLWluLW9uLWdlcm1hbndpbmdzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIwLWRpc2FzdGVyLW9mZmVycy1pbnNpZ2h0LW9uLWZyZW5jaC1hbHBzLWNyYXNoL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Germanwings Airbus A320 was carrying 150 people when it crashed into the French Alps Tuesday, authorities believe killing everyone aboard.

Retired U.S. Airline Capt. Andy Danziger, who was once tasked with flying then-Sen. Obama on his 2008 presidential election day, says it’s likely too early to speculate on the cause, but there are plenty of factors available to consider. Those range from the plane’s decades-old age, to the pilots manning the aircraft and what could potentially have been done to save them all.

The veteran Boeing pilot, who flew 737s, 757s and 767s during his 27-year career, now weighs in on some questions arising on the mysterious crash.

WHAT ARE SOME OF THE POSSIBILITIES BEHIND TODAY’S CRASH?

It’s pure speculation at this point. Much of the early news reporting after an accident turns out not to be correct. For instance early reports this morning claimed that the plane made a distress call to Air Traffic Control. Initial reports indicate that no distress call was received. So to even speculate on what caused the accident is very premature at this point.

Capt. Danziger, pictured in front of Obama’s campaign plane in 2008, has weighed in on Tuesday’s deadly crash in the French Alps while using his 27 years of aviation experience.

WHAT ABOUT A PRESSURE FAILURE?

What we think we know is that the plane descended from 38,000-feet (it’s last reported cruise altitude) to 6,500-feet (the elevation where it crashed) in about eight minutes. That equates to about 4,000 feet-per-minute (fmp).

If there were a pressurization failure the pilots must descend to 10,000-feet (or the higher of the lowest safe altitude considering the terrain below them), within four minutes. A 4,000 fpm descent rate would not be unexpected if the plane were descending due to a pressurization failure. But then we would have to wonder why the plane didn’t level off at 10,000-feet (or higher if necessary for terrain clearance).

It would appear that the pilots started the plane into its descent (the autopilot wouldn’t do this automatically if there was a pressurization failure).

Search and rescue personnel are seen at the crash site of the Germanwings Airbus A320 in the French Alps above the southeastern town of Seyne on Tuesday. All 150 people aboard are feared dead.

WHY WOULDN’T THE PILOTS HAVE LEVELED THE PLANE OFF AT 10,000-FEET OR HIGHER?

At 38,000-feet you only have about five seconds of useful consciousness to get your oxygen mask on before you’re not capable of making good decisions due to hypoxia (lack of oxygen to the brain). And if the pilots were smokers they might not have had even that much time.

It’s obviously possible that the pilots started to descend but failed to set the autopilot to 10,000-feet before losing consciousness, if they hadn’t put on their oxygen masks. But it would also be surprising that neither of them regained enough consciousness during the descent to recognize that the plane’s autopilot wasn’t set to level them off at 10,000-feet . This is a scenario that is most certainly being looked at.

Search and rescue personnel are seen being lowered close to the crash site Tuesday. Danziger says the plane dropped from 38,000- to 6,500-feet in about eight minutes. It should have stabilized around 10,000-feet.

WHAT ABOUT ENGINE FAILURE?

It’s unlikely that this descent was due to an engine failure.

When one engine fails in a commercial airliner the plane would have to descend to a lower altitude where it can maintain altitude on one engine, but that descent is usually at a very leisurely pace and the level off altitude would be considerably higher (usually someplace in the mid to high teens or even low 20’s of altitude) depending on the planes current weight. The plane would come down at its drift down speed to its single engine cruising altitude.

Danziger, who flew 737s, 757s and 767s, says he’s not a fan of Airbus planes. An Airbus A320 plane is seen under construction in Hamburg, northern Germany.

ANY OTHER POSSIBILITIES?

An in-flight fire or smoke in the cabin or cockpit would also be another possible reason for the pilots’ rapid controlled descent that they appear to have made. Even more serious than a pressurization problem, this would be a pilot’s worst fear.

Smoke or a fire could have overcome the pilots, rendering them unconscious. It’s possible that they could have started an autopilot descent with a planned level-off altitude of 10,000-feet and were rendered unconscious due to smoke, fumes or fire – the installed oxygen system and smoke goggles on the flight deck may not have been sufficient for the level of smoke. It’s then also possible that part or the entire autopilot computer located below the cockpit malfunctioned and though the airplane was set to level off at 10,000-feet it failed to do so, allowing the plane to descend into the mountains.

WHAT CAN ITS SPEED TELL US?

Latest media reports that I’m seeing are that the plane descended at 400 knots or 460 mph. If that were its ground speed that would probably indicate a tailwind at altitude and not necessarily be indicative of another problem beyond what we’re talking about here so far. If there were a headwind then that is above the designed cruise speed of the plane and would indicate a whole ‘nother host of possibilities for speculation.

Employees work at the Airbus SAS A320 in Tianjin, China. Danzinger says all Airbuses use a system called ‘fly-by-wire’ that relies on wires to transmit electronic signals between the controls and control surfaces.

HOW OLD IS THE PLANE?

They’re making on the news like this is not an old airplane. It was manufactured in 1991. For an A320, that’s very old. A320’s started flying around 1987. That makes this a very old A320.

HOW DOES THE PLANE’S AGE HAVE AN EFFECT ON ITS SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE?

Age of a plane is much more complicated than just it’s year of manufacture. Planes have life limited parts, some based on total flight hours and some based on total cycles. We’ll need to see the total hours/cycles on this airframe before we can definitively say this particular aircraft was “high time” or approaching any life limits.

Generally the manufacturer develops maintenance procedures that once approved by the civil aviation authorities, extend the life limits of major aircraft components. While possible, it isn’t likely that this plane was operating beyond its approved service limits.

Danzinger says the Airbus computer system interprets the pilot’s orders and makes necessary inputs. It will normally not allow the pilots own input to be executed, but that can be overridden.

IS IT POSSIBLE THIS PLANE WASN’T OPERATING WITH APPROVED SERVICE LIMITS?

There have been many occasions where an airline mistakenly failed to complete certain required procedures that would allow a plane to remain airworthy, however, it would be pure irresponsible speculation to suggest that anything like that happened here. Components break on otherwise airworthy aircraft regularly; they’re repaired in accordance with approved procedures and returned to service. Obviously most mechanical issues don’t result in accidents.

WHAT DO PILOTS LIKE YOURSELF THINK OF THE AIRBUS OVERALL?

Boeing pilots, like me, generally aren’t particularly fond of Airbus. Airbus pilots generally like them. Of those that I know who have flown both, many like the sophisticated avionics and cockpit displays of the A320 but don’t think that the plane is built as well as a Boeing. I’m sure that there are also a great many Airbus pilots who are totally enamored with the plane in every way.

WHAT IS FLY-BY-WIRE?

Fly-by-wire is where your controls aren’t hooked up directly (via cables, push tubes etc.) to the control surfaces (ailerons, elevators or rudders) of the plane but instead use wires to transmit electronic signals to actuators connected to these control surfaces.

DO AIRBUS AND BOEING USE FLY-BY-WIRE?

Airbus has exclusively been using “fly-by-wire” on all of its planes since the A320. Boeing has been using it since the 777 was introduced. Both manufacturers have different design philosophies regarding these designs.

HOW ARE THE CONTROLS DIFFERENT BETWEEN AN AIRBUS AND A BOEING?

The Airbus computer system generally interprets what the pilot asks for and makes the necessary inputs to the control surfaces to achieve this. If the pilot asks for something that the computer thinks will exceed a limitation on the plane (bank angle for instance) it will normally not allow the pilots input to be executed. This can be overridden by the pilots but it isn’t normally done. The pilots make inputs, the computer interprets them and then (the computer) makes the final decision as to what command will be executed.

In the Boeing, the computer doesn’t normally second guess the pilots control inputs. If the pilot tries to roll a 777 upside down it will roll upside down, the Airbus autopilot would normally stop the bank angle automatically at 30 degrees. Airbus thinks that this is safer; Boeing thinks that their way is safer. (Remember I’m a Boeing fan and a Boeing pilot).

Airbus thinks that an engineer (who’s probably not even a pilot) sitting at his desk with a slide rule can anticipate everything that could happen in flight and limits pilots’ normal authority to control the airplane (remember that almost everything can be overridden but it’s not normally done, and since it’s not normally done the pilots aren’t thinking about overriding the autopilot controls). Boeing’s philosophy is not to try and second guess the pilots inputs or controls. Do not construe anything that I’m saying here to imply that one manufacturer makes safer planes than the other.

WHAT IS LUFTHANSA’S ROLE IN THIS INCIDENT?

Germanwings is a subsidiary of Lufthansa. I don’t know their exact relationship but if it’s like a typical subsidiary then it’s operated completely independently of Lufthansa. It would have its own dedicated maintenance team, pilots, flight attendants and other management staff and employees. Schedules would be made in conjunction with the parent airline but again are ultimately under control of the subsidiary. Germanwings may or may not subcontract some of their training or maintenance to Lufthansa (or anyone else) to save money. The important thing to understand is that Germanwings is its own airline with its own operating certificate, its own operating rules, contracts etc. It is a low cost carrier (not implying anything whatsoever by saying that and it doesn’t mean that anything about their operation is not as safe as any legacy airline), quite the opposite of its legacy parent Lufthansa which has much higher costs.

IS THE AIRCRAFT ANY LESS SAFE THAN OTHERS?

Just because it’s Lufthansa or Germanwings doesn’t make it safer or less safe than another more or less equal airline.

CAN YOU COMPARE U.S. AIRLINES TO OUTSIDE ONES?

We do know that there are some safety issues with some airlines in parts of Asia and Africa. Airlines of Western Europe in general have comparable safety records to those of the United States. But it would also be wrong to say that the safety standards and training at Germanwings is the same as at the parent company Lufthansa. It may very well be but it also might not be.

HOW ARE DISCOUNT AIRLINES DIFFERENT, ESPECIALLY SAFETY WISE?

Low cost carriers (LCC) do some things differently than legacy carriers, that’s how they save money and operate at low cost. Legacy carriers typically pay higher salaries and sometimes attract more experienced crewmembers than a LCC. Meeting the letter of the law is very different than always greatly exceeding the letter of the law. LCC generally do not excel at going “over the top” to exceed all safety standards that are in place at the legacy carriers (though some do). Again, making no accusations here, just stating general facts.

WHAT ARE “AB INITIO” PILOTS? ARE THEY SAFE?

Europe in general trains a lot of “ab initio” pilots. This is where they hire very or even completely inexperienced pilots and train them to operate their aircraft from day one. They’re frequently released to fly the line with paying passengers with very low total flight hours and experience. They have passed their training in accordance with all of the existing regulations of their country, but with flight time comes experience and with experience you gain wisdom. Some of the newer captains at European airlines are lacking in the kind of experience levels that we’re used to seeing here in the U.S. as well. These particular issues may not have come to play in this accident but they are differences between U.S. carriers and European ones.

Boustead Heavy Industries Corporation Berhad (BHIC) has signed an agreement to acquire a 30 percent share in the Airbus Helicopters Simulation Center in Malaysia.

This joint venture agreement was signed by BHIC Chairman YBhg Tan Sri Dato’ Seri Azizan Arrifin and Philippe Monteux, Airbus Helicopters senior vice president for South East Asia & Pacific region, in the presence of Malaysian Defence Minister Y.B. Dato’ Seri Hishammuddin Tun Hussein.

The simulation facility – operated by Airbus Helicopters Malaysia since January 2013, and located at the Malaysia International Aerospace Center – houses a full-flight simulator for the H225 and H225M helicopter types, which are 11-ton-category civilian and military twin-engine aircraft in the Super Puma family. The training site was set up as part of Airbus Helicopters’ contract to provide 12 H225M rotorcraft (formerly known as the EC725) to the Royal Malaysian Air Force.

In addition to Royal Malaysian Air Force pilots, the simulation center also offers training to H225/H225M pilots and crews from customers in the military, paramilitary and civil sectors throughout the Asia/Pacific region, and has received trainees from such countries as Australia, South Korea, Taiwan, Oman, Japan and Thailand during the past two years.

The Airbus Helicopters Simulation Center successfully trained some 200 pilots and logged 1,940 hours with the full-flight simulator during its first year of operation. This activity increased by over 40 percent in 2014 to deliver 2,782 simulator hours, training approximately 300 pilots.

“We have enjoyed a very strong and successful partnership with BHIC in an ongoing joint venture that provides maintenance, repair and overhaul services for military helicopters, which has ensured a high availability of the Royal Malaysian Air Force’s H225M fleet,” said Monteux. “With BHIC now entering into the pilot training sector with us as well, we will be able to strengthen our alliance to further develop the local helicopter industry, and at the same time expand our regional portfolios.”

Bernard Josseaux has been appointed to head the Malaysian simulation joint venture and will be the general manager of the simulation center. He previously was the Technical and Program Director for new investments and training devices at the Helisim Training Academy in Marseille- Provence, France, and comes with 30 years of extensive simulator experience.

“The location of our simulation center in Malaysia has enabled easy access to high quality training for all H225/H225M operators in this region,” explained Josseaux. “The outstanding achievement of the center within its first two years of operation shows that customers appreciate the proximity of this service offering and we are confident of its continued success for many years to come.”"

Here's what we do know. The Airbus A320 is one of the most advanced, popular, and durable airliners in the world. With more than 11,500 sold and 6,200 planes in services, the A320 series is arguably Airbus' greatest success. With just 23 fatal incidents in a quarter century of flying, the 320 has an excellent service history.

This was Germanwings first fatal accident since the airline's founding in 1997. Parent company Lufthansa hasn't had a fatal crash in more than two decades.

""Lufthansa and Germanwings both have great safety records,"" aviation expert and founder of NYCAviation Phil Derner, Jr. said. ""They've taken great steps to maintain a high level of safety.""

Although the aircraft involved in the incident required maintenance twice in the two days prior to the crash, Lufthansa's CEO assured the public that the Airbus flew with a clean bill of health each time it took off.

In fact, the European aviation system ranks as one of the most congested, and yet safest, in the world. With more than 30,000 flights per day covering 21 million nautical miles, accidents remain exceedingly rare.

None of this means that safety or a problem with the plane won't be identified as a factor in the crash. Authorities are perplexed, the New York Times reported, about the lack of communication between the plane's pilots and air traffic controllers during the relatively slow, 10-minute descent that preceded the A320's crash.

The plane's cockpit voice recorder was also damaged in the impact, potentially limiting investigators' ability to reconstruct the events of the accident."

ANALYSIS: Can Airbus challenge 787 with A330neo? | Analysis | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Mon, 23 Mar 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYW5hbHlzaXMtY2FuLWFpcmJ1cy1jaGFsbGVuZ2UtNzg3LXdpdGgtYTMzMG5lby8xMTYxNzcuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus added a dash of spice to the mid-range, mid-size market with last year’s launch of an updated version of its best-selling widebody, the A330. But in a sector where there are already several established types, is there enough room for another big twin to be dropped into the mix?

The numbers so far suggest there is. Building off the back of over 1,300 sales of the baseline A330ceo, Airbus has racked up 145 orders and commitments from seven customers for the re-engined, Rolls-Royce Trent 7000-powered A330neo since launching it at last year’s Farnborough air show. Not only does this tally put the aircraft well on its way to Airbus’s publicly-touted 1,000-aircraft sales target but it also includes several blue-chip customers, including Delta Air Lines and Steve Udvar-Hazy’s Air Lease.

The outline definition of the A330neo family is a fairly simple exercise: take today’s A330-200 and -300, add the new-generation Trent 7000 engines, some aerodynamic tweaks and a revised interior with “cabin efficiency enablers” (to create room for up to 10 more seats), and you end up with the A330-800 and -900, respectively. The latter is the lead variant, with service entry with an as-yet-unnamed launch operator in late 2017.

But when scrutinising the details of this warmed-up A330, some could be forgiven for feeling a bit of deja vu. As Boeing is quick to point out, the A350 started out over a decade ago as an A330-based airframe powered by 787-derived engines until Airbus regrouped and relaunched its assault on the Dreamliner with the all-new A350 XWB family.

In 2006, when today’s A350 XWB finally crystalised, things looked pretty bleak for Airbus in the widebody sector. The A340-600 was being trounced by the 777-300ER and the A330 was facing a huge threat from the 787 as Boeing rampaged across the globe signing up customers for its all-new twinjet. To make matters worse, Airbus’s eventual clean-sheet response, the XWB, was not due to deliver until at least four years after the Dreamliner.

Airbus took a pragmatic approach to its predicament, launching a counter-attack with the A330. The twinjet had at that time been in production for over a decade alongside its sister product, the A340, and between them they had accumulated an installed fleet of over 550 aircraft. So the twinjet had certain attractions of its own, not least of which were price, maturity and good availability.

Airbus’s aggressive sales strategy was already paying off when the 787 programme went into meltdown in 2007/08. This not only gave Airbus the breathing space it needed to get the A350 orderbook moving but also added impetus to A330’s renaissance as airlines sought capacity while the Dreamliner programme was effectively in limbo.

“[The 787 delays] made the A330 the only airplane available at that time,” says Boeing’s head of marketing, Randy Tinseth.

Airbus’s head of A330 product marketing, Crawford Hamilton, concedes that the twinjet benefited from the Dreamliner’s early woes, but is adamant that was only part of the reason for its success. “Undoubtedly, what’s gone on with the 787 has not been a hindrance to the A330’s success. What that leverages off is the fact that when you buy an A330 you get a product that is very reliable, you know what you are buying and you know when you’re going to get it, which is important if you’re trying to work out a schedule for next year and then you find out your aircraft might not be coming.”

And even with the 787 programme now over its crisis and production ramping up, Hamilton says the current A330 has still been giving a good account of itself.

“The market is split about 50/50 at the moment. The current A330 is around 900-920 aircraft sold against the 787-8 and -9, which has sold 950 to 1,000 aircraft,” he says.

But Tinseth, unsurprisingly, is not convinced that the A330 is all that Airbus claims it is cracked up to be: “Look at all the things Airbus has done to try to keep the A330 viable. First they went to a freighter configuration, then they tried to increase the take-off weight, then they tried to sell it as a domestic or regional airplane,” he says.

“None of those things were taking hold in the market so I don’t think we’re surprised they went forward to re-engine the aircraft and make other improvements.”

And Tinseth cannot resist reminding us that Airbus first tried to counter the 787 with a re-engined A330 proposition when Boeing launched the Dreamliner.

“This is the airplane they brought to the market 10 years ago when oil was $40 a barrel,” he says. “And the fact is, it didn’t do well. When the fuel price was even lower than it is today, airlines looked at the value proposition of the 787 and they chose it. And we think they’ll do the same today.”

Hamilton is quick to dispel the Boeing history lesson, pointing out that today’s re-engined A330 is very different to the original A350 proposal.

“Our Neo recipe is keeping everything that’s good and changing the things where you get the biggest benefits,” he says. “It’s not an A350 Mk1. That was marked by lots of compromises everywhere. It was restricted by being based on another airplane. It was a good exercise in how not to do it, and we’ve learnt from that.”

Airbus says the changes it is introducing on the A330neo reduce fuel consumption by 14% per seat over the equivalent current A330, as well as providing a range increase of up to 400nm (740km). And the revisions will deliver significant reductions in operating costs.

“Per trip, the A330neo’s cash operating costs are 8% lower than the A330ceo, and per seat 11% lower, because we have the seat gain [through the cabin reorganisation],” Hamilton says.

Airbus claims a significant per-seat cost advantage for the improved models over the 787. Hamilton says the 310-seat A330-900 has cash operating costs 1% lower than a 304-seat (two-class), General Electric GEnx-powered 787-9 on a 4,000nm sector and this advantage increases to 7% when all operating expenses are included such as capital or lease charges.

Interestingly, Airbus’s 2014 list price for the A330-900 of $275 million was some $18 million more than the 787-9, but for the purposes of its operating-cost comparison it assumes that the A330’s monthly lease would be $200,000 lower than the Dreamliner’s, at $1.05 million.

Rob Morris, head of consultancy at Flightglobal’s Ascend advisory arm, believes that if Airbus’s claims for the A330neo are accurate, it could be onto a winner: “The A330neo should be able to offer direct operating costs which will match or better those of the 787, particularly at the 4,000nm medium range that Airbus is targeting the aircraft at and beneath which the majority of widebody passenger schedules are flown today. If Airbus can deliver such economics in the A330neo then yes, it can challenge the 787 with expectations of market success.”

However, Ascend is less bullish than Toulouse on the ultimate market for the re-engined jet. In its 2014 Flightglobal Fleet Forecast, Ascend predicted sales of around 550 A330neos over the next 20 years.

This chimes with Boeing’s view, with Tinseth conceding that he sees a modest long-term requirement for the A330neo: “We see a market for 400-500 airplanes over the next 10-15 years,” he says.

Tinseth also admits that the re-engining creates a more potent rival for the Dreamliner than the stillborn A350-800 which the Neo has effectively replaced in the Airbus product line-up.

“This is a better airplane than the A350-800, there’s no question about it,” he says. “That airplane was a simple shrink and didn’t have anything going for it.”

But this could be a problem for Airbus too, adds Tinseth. “That A330-900 is a bigger airplane than the A350-800. So it not only completes with our airplanes but frankly it’s going to steal share from the A350-900 if they price aggressively.”

Morris says that some element of the 500 A330neo sales that Ascend forecasts for the A330neo will inevitably come from the A350 market. “An economically optimised medium-range aircraft could potentially be attractive to some airlines that do not have the need for the longer range offered by the A350 XWB and 787. But there was also probably a greater risk that the 787-9 could have captured some sales that may now go to the A330neo.”

Hamilton says Airbus broadly sees the two widebody families as appealing to different markets, and emphasises the A350’s size and range advantage over the A330.

“The A350-900 is sold on the fact it is a bigger aircraft with more payload and more range,” he says, pointing to Delta’s order for a mix of A330neos and A350-900s as an example of how the two types are complementary to each other.

“For Delta, where they need the A350-900 is on the Pacific. Where they need the A330 is closer to home. It’s a transatlantic aircraft and an aircraft that brings the right mix of economics and capability,” says Hamilton.

An important factor in Delta’s selection of the Airbus package over a 777/787 offering from Seattle was its installed fleet of A330s, and Hamilton says the plan is to use this leverage elsewhere in A330neo campaigns.

“The bedrock of any market is where you already are. With the A330, we’ve got a record number of operators for a widebody, at around 105-106. That’s your prime target because people already know the aircraft very well,” says Hamilton.

Air Lease’s Udvar-Hazy, who played a key role in launching the A330neo and has orders for 25 -900s, concurs that existing operators are leading candidates: “For an A330/A340 operator, the A330-800/900 is an economical replacement alternative.”

He adds that for an existing Airbus operator, “the A330-800/900 is an effective next step and quite competitive with the 787-8, particularly in terms of capital cost advantage”.

Hamilton says Airbus is also targeting – for both the current version and the Neo – the 777-200 and 767 replacement markets, “and where the competition maybe hasn’t come up to scratch and there’s opportunity. Consistently we’ve been outselling the opposition and therefore we’ll just try and keep that up.”

But one inevitable challenge that Airbus faces before it completes the transition of production to the A330neo is to sell the remaining delivery slots for current-generation models in the production cycle.

“They’ve got to figure out a way to fill the A330 line, which looks pretty bleak,” says Tinseth.

Morris believes Airbus still has a “significant number” of A330ceo slots to sell, despite the recent announcement that production will be reduced from the current nine aircraft a month to six in the first quarter of next year, He estimates this move has reduced the target by around 100 units.

“Assuming transition to full Neo production by the end of 2019, then there would appear to be around 300 A330ceo slots remaining to be produced from the beginning of this year,” says Morris.

Ascend estimates that the A330ceo’s true backlog (adjusted for customers such as Kingfisher Airlines that will not take their aircraft) is around 166 units.

“Fourteen aircraft have been delivered to date this year, indicating that 180 of those 300 estimated slots have firm customers. So that still leaves 120 aircraft to be sold under this scenario. 2016, 2017 and 2018 look particularly challenging, with an estimated 34, 42 and 36 slots open respectively,” says Morris.

“In the face of this challenge, Airbus may be forced to offer some serious ‘last-off-the-line’ discounts to encourage customers to purchase these aircraft,” he adds.

So Airbus still has some hurdles to clear as it brings the A330neo to market, but just under a year into the programme will be relatively pleased with its progress so far. What remains to be seen is whether the market really is as big as it predicts.

Air accident investigators say 133 passengers had a “lucky” escape after an Air Canada plane crash-landed landed short of a runway, was ripped apart by a bank of antennas and came skidding to a halt on its belly.

The Airbus A320 was completely written off late on Saturday night after the impact sheared off its landing gear, an engine and its nose cone – yet only 25 people were injured, all but one of whom have since been released from hospital.

Air Canada’s executives used the technical term “hard landing” to describe the incident during a press conference on Sunday – but passenger Mike Magnus described that as “obvious political manoeuvring”.

“This was not a hard landing. This was an actual crash,” said the 60-year-old businessman who was sitting in the front row.

“There is no doubt in my mind. It was the closest I’ve ever come to death.”

Mike Cunningham, a regional manager for Canada's Transport Safety Board, said initial reports showed that Flight AC624 came down some 300 metres short of the runway at Halifax's Stanfield International Airport in stormy conditions.

“They touched down 1,100 feet short of the runway so I'd say they're pretty lucky,” he said.

Mr Cunningham said the plane hit an antenna array, shearing the main landing gear off before sliding on its belly on to the runway for another 1,100 feet before coming to a stop. There was significant damage to the plane and he could not rule out weather as a factor, he said.

He also said he believes a power line was severed, which led to a loss of power at the airport.

“All of us at Air Canada are greatly relieved that there have been no critical injuries as a result of this incident,” airline chief operating officer Klaus Goersch said.

Airport spokesman Peter Spurway praised the quick-thinking of the crew and passengers, who evacuated the plane in less than a minute.

“We just kicked the doors out and jumped on to the wing and then ran because we just wanted to get away from the airplane in case of explosions or anything,” said Dominic Stettler, a father of three.

5 Possible Causes Of The Germanwings Jetliner Crash [Updated] - Popular Science,"Thu, 26 Mar 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHNjaS5jb20vNS1saWtlbHktY2F1c2VzLWdlcm1hbi1haXJidXMtY3Jhc2gv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Update (3/25/2015, 8:48 p.m. ET): An initial analysis of the cockpit voice recorder suggests one of the pilots was locked out of the cockpit at the time Flight 9525 began its final descent, and failed to get back in even after smashing the door. This revelation will almost certainly change the scope of the investigation, barring any indication it wasn’t a deliberate act. (For instance, if the other pilot in the cockpit had a medical emergency.) If investigators suspect the act was deliberate, however, it’s almost certain we can expect further changes to cockpit security measures.

Yesterday morning, a German-operated Airbus A320, which was flying between Barcelona and Düsseldorf, crashed into the French Alps. All 150 passengers on board–including two pilots, four flight attendants, a group of German students, a pair of noted opera singers, and individuals from 18 different countries–lost their lives.

Right now we know Germanwings Flight 4U 9525 was cruising at 38,000 feet when it began an unexpected descent that, 8 minutes later, ended when it slammed into the mountainside 6,800 feet up. That’s an average descent of approximately 4,000 feet per minute, which is notable because it isn’t frantic or uncontrolled; aircraft routinely descend at 3,000 to 4,000 feet per minute. (During emergencies, a rate of 7,000 to 8,000 feet per minute or faster isn’t unusual.)

What’s mysterious is the lack of a distress call. The pilot’s emergency mantra–“aviate, navigate, communicate”–might explain this, since it programs aviators to fly the airplane first; then find a place to land it; and, finally, reach for the radio. On the other hand, it might not.

The French civil aviation authority (the Bureau d’Enquêtes et d’Analyses pour la Sécurité de l’Aviation Civile, or BEA) and Germany’s Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Investigation is currently searching for answers. So far, they’ve recovered a flight data recorder from the crash site and are poring over the device’s pilot audio.

While the world awaits more information, we called up a 40-year veteran of National Transportation Safety Board accident investigations and Federal Aviation Administration regulation development. Our source asked to remain anonymous, since he’s not involved in the investigation, yet proposed the five following scenarios as possible causes, based on information currently available to the public.

1) A Maintenance Problem

The fated Airbus A320 received maintenance the day before the flight. Our expert says that draws immediate scrutiny, particularly if something were repaired, replaced, or deferred (i.e. for later repair).

Germanwings’ low-cost airline status is unlikely to be a factor in maintenance or safety questions, though. Budget airlines adhere to the same safety standards as premium carriers–including, in this case, parent company Lufthansa–and instead reduce costs through other means. They’ll cut meals and squeeze in more seats, fly through cheaper secondary airports, reduce call center staff (thanks to online-only booking strategies), and standardize aircraft fleets to limit training costs. Regulators do tend to increase surveillance of maintenance and training patterns among airlines with financial issues, but this makes cost-cutting even less likely of a cause.

Additionally, outsourced maintenance has been a contentious issue among even premium airlines. But Germanwings aircraft receive routine maintenance from Lufthansa-Technik, which has a stellar reputation for maintenance quality. Lufthansa’s fleet has flown the now-crashed aircraft since 1991, so its maintenance records should be readily available to investigators.

A maintenance problem could be relatively straightforward fix, in terms of safeguarding other airplanes. If the age of the aircraft somehow contributed–especially given the caliber of Lufthansa’s oversight–this could prompt maintenance changes to similar aircraft in fleets around the world.

2) Structural Failure

Our source also zeroed in on the flight’s short duration at a cruising altitude. This reminded him of catastrophic, pressure-related structural failures at high altitudes, including the 1988 Aloha Airlines Flight 243 accident near Maui, Hawaii. In that case, a section of roof tore off the fuselage immediately after reaching cruising altitude of 24,000 feet. The incident killed a flight attendant and injured dozens of passengers, but, remarkably, the pilots safely landed the jet.

Of note in that case: The crew’s oxygen system was damaged and inoperable, but they were at a relatively low altitude, so they remained conscious. If something similar happened to Flight 9525, and their oxygen system was also rendered inoperable, the crew wouldn’t have had such n advantage–they were cruising at an oxygen-starved altitude of 38,000 feet at the time of descent. A major electrical failure associated with a structural failure could have silenced their radios.

Because the aircraft crashed on land and not at sea, and all the pieces are likely present (or not), it should be easier to detect structural problems–though it still won’t be easy. “The high-speed impact certainly has introduced additional complexity in the investigation,” our source says. “While it adds many more individual pieces to the puzzle, the absence of any significant post-crash fire means that those pieces likely will reflect damage that occurred before or during that impact.”

3) Pressurization Failure

Structural failure can cause rapid decompression, as we covered above, but a more gradual onset of pressure loss might go undetected until it’s too late.

This has happened in several cases in mostly smaller aircraft, including golfer Payne Stewart’s 1999 crash. If this somehow incapacitated the pilots, in spite of alerts and oxygen masks, the aircraft would have continued on autopilot until it ran out of fuel. If the autopilot was deactivated, perhaps by a crew member attempting to bring the airplane lower before losing consciousness, then it could have descended gradually but without any ability to alter its general flight path.

Should that prove to be the case, we might see faster development and implementation of airliner-ready “automatic emergency descent systems” (AEDS), which could detect pressure loss and automatically route the airplane to lower altitude, giving crew time to recover. Future airplanes might even be able to land themselves at a nearby airport. Right now, the AEDS technology is available on a few newer corporate jets not present on any commercial aircraft. (Although Airbus is considering it for their new A350.) Such a system is available for private pilots, however, in the shape of an iPad app called Xavion; the app uses the device’s hardware to monitor flight conditions and take corrective measures through the airplane’s autopilot.

4) Fire

A fire can quickly overcome crew members, whether it originates in the airplane’s electrical system or, say, cargo or luggage in the hold. Such a scenario brought down ValuJet Flight 592 in May 1996. In that incident, improperly stored oxygen canisters ignited and flames spread quickly.

Something in the cargo compartment of Flight 9525 might have ignited and caused a fast-moving fire that disabled electrical systems, including communication systems, and incapacitated the crew. “If they had an onboard fire, one of the first acts is to isolate the fire and shut down any systems that can contribute to it,” says our source (who is, of course, also a pilot). “If that happened and they found themselves enveloped with smoke on the flight deck, they would have needed a specialized mask for seeing their instruments through the smoke. Not being able to see could have resulted in the airplane flying into the ground even though terrain alarms were going off.” (It’s not known at this point if the aircraft had such masks on board.)

Along these lines, recent debate has raged over putting lithium batteries in checked luggage. They can be volatile if improperly stored, and an FAA test conducted last year resulted in two explosive fires in two laboratory simulations. If a fire is indicated, it will likely result in new transport regulations and possibly more prohibitions against certain types of cargo on commercial flights.

5) Malicious Intent

However unlikely, the airplane could have been intentionally brought down, and investigators will obviously keep that possibility in mind. Experts will pore over the passengers and anyone who potentially had access to the airplane, our source noted, including how thoroughly the passenger security screening was that day, whether someone could have planted a device or done something during maintenance, if anyone could have breached the cockpit, and how secure the aircraft was while at Barcelona.

***

If previous crashes have proven anything, it’s that there’s always risk–however small–and often a surprising variety of factors can lead to disaster. And even though the BEA has its hands on a flight data recorder, it will take a long time to get to the heart of the matter. The overarching cause or causes may come shortly–that is, the physical chain of events that brought down Flight 9525–but learning how and why those failures happened will test the investigation team. In the end, after whatever brought down this aircraft is discovered, aviation will be even safer for it."
Airbus Helicopters targets AW139 with new H160 | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Tue, 03 Mar 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLXRhcmdldHMtYXcxMzktd2l0aC1uZXctaDE2MC8xMTYwNzkuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters has today ended months of speculation with the official unveiling today at Heli-Expo in Orlando of its new H160 medium-class twin-engined rotorcraft which it has repositioned in order to be what chief executive Guillaume Faury describes as “the AW139 killer”.

To effectively target the strongly selling AgustaWestland type, Airbus Helicopters has significantly altered the capabilities of its new model over the past 24 months.

Initial concept studies in 2012 envisaged the rotorcraft – then known as the X4 – as a direct replacement for its 4.5t AS365 and 4.9t EC155 Dauphin family. However, the airframer has changed course. It has upped the maximum take-off weight to 5.5-6t, promising to be able to carry 12 passengers a distance of 120nm (222km) with a cruise speed of 160kt (296km/h) at ISA +20°. In other words, matching the performance of the AW139, while weighing 1t less. In addition, Faury says the H160 will be around 15-20% more ""energy efficient"" than its rivals.

First flight is scheduled for later this year with certification and service entry envisioned for 2018. Certification flight testing will be performed with three prototype aircraft and one pre-serial example. Orders for the new helicopter will begin to be taken next year.

Faury says it repositioned the H160 according to the market’s view of “what a medium helicopter is today”.

Airbus Helicopters

What matters for customers, he says, is the performance of the aircraft combined with safety, reliability, efficiency, comfort and ease of maintenance. “We will confront the AW139. I believe it will have difficulty to compete with the H160 on all these parameters.

“It [the H160] will be more competitive in all aspects. It will be the reason that customers move in the direction of the H160.

“This is clearly the new generation in this segment and clearly will be much better than the competition. It is the AW139 killer.”

Although Airbus Helicopters has ditched many of the advanced features seen on the initial concept study – most notably the fly-by-wire controls – it still sees the new rotorcraft as significantly ahead of its peers.

It will feature a fully composite airframe with the main fuselage made in house at its Donauwörth manufacturing centre and the tail boom fabricated by France’s Daher. The five-blade main rotor will use the distinctive hockey stick-shaped Blue Edge blades, and avionics will be the latest iteration of the Helionix suite that entered service on the EC175 and EC145 T2 last year.

Other notable features include a shrouded Fenstron tail rotor which is canted at 12° to provide additional lift, a rear “biplane” stabiliser on the tail to improve low-speed handling, and electric landing gear and brakes.

Airbus Helicopters

“The is a very important level of expectation [from customers]. Not by having this or that technology, but by assuring first a high level of availability, high performance, high comfort [through] lower levels of noise and vibration, size and speed,” says Faury.

Although much of the helicopter’s configuration has been frozen for some time, the airframer did, however, recently drop Pratt & Whitney Canada’s PW210E as an option, despite previous indications that it would be the lead engine. Instead, it will proceed with a sole powerplant in the form of the new 1,100-1,300shp (820-969kW) Arrano being developed by France’s Turbomeca. It sees the Arrano as able to provide sufficient power to match the performance of the PT6 engines used on the AW139.

However, initial ground runs of the manufacturer’s dynamic helicopter zero test rig are likely to be conducted with the already delivered P&WC powerplants.

The H145 has arrived in Brazil for a customer tour to demonstrate the capabilities of this enhanced Airbus Helicopters rotorcraft in land-based and offshore service.

During visits to the cities of São Paulo, Curitiba, Brasília, Belo Horizonte and Rio de Janeiro, the H145 will be presented to civilian and offshore operators, along with governmental and military agencies.

The H145 – previously known as the EC145 T2 – has been upgraded to improve performance in hot and high conditions, augment its flight characteristics, provide lower noise levels, reduce pilot workload and further enhance operational safety. Features include the incorporation of Airbus Helicopters’ signature Fenestron shrouded tail rotor, application of the company-developed Helionix avionics suite, and the use of new Turbomeca Arriel 2 E engines with dual channel FADEC digital controls.

“By combining the EC145 family’s proven performance with Airbus Helicopters’ continued focus on product development, the H145 is a powerful, comfortable, modern and versatile multi-purpose rotorcraft already coming with a large range of optional to perform a broad mission spectrum”, explained Mesrob Karalekian, Airbus Helicopters’ vice-president – head of Latin America region. “We expect the H145 to have the same success in Brazil as it has already seen in other countries. Thanks to its performance, this rotorcraft is able to meet customers’ operational needs in this region’s demanding high temperature environment”.

Designed for superior performance, the H145 provides unrivalled CAT A and PC1 capabilities at maximum take-off weight. Its compact overall size and spacious cabin are also key assets in the offshore market – for which it offers increased capacity and power. These advantages also are delivered in the military version, renamed the H145M – resulting in the very latest high-technology lightweight twin-engine helicopter on the defense market.

The H145’s large sliding side doors and rear clamshell doors ensure quick and easy loading and unloading of patients and cargo, making it one of the most suitable of all helicopters for emergency medical services, police missions, search and rescue, among other duties. With its night vision goggle compatibility, the H145 is also fully equipped to perform missions after dark.

Designed with the goals of customer satisfaction and increased availability in mind, the H145 enables operators to carry out ongoing maintenance and repair work without the need for lengthy inspections and service downtime.

“With 13 EC145-family helicopters in service with civil and governmental operators in Brazil, Helibras, fully supported by Airbus Helicopters, has the necessary means to answer our customer’s requests for logistics and maintenance support,” added François Arnaud, Helibras vice-president sales and marketing. “We will also offer specific training for pilots and engineers, complete with theory, practical components and simulator training.”

Since the H145’s first delivery in July 2014 to the German DRF Luftrettung air rescue organization, approximately 20 aircraft have been received by customers worldwide. To date, Airbus Helicopters has booked orders and options for some 140 H145s, along with 15 in the military H145M variant for the German Army and five H145Ms for the Royal Thai Navy.

The U.S. Army’s recent order for an additional 41 UH-72A Lakota helicopters underscores the continuing value the Army places on the Lakota’s low cost multi-mission capabilities, high performance and reliability. It also validates the work done by Airbus Helicopters Inc. and Airbus Group Inc. to fulfil commitments made to the Army and the U.S. government.

To date, the Department of Defense has placed orders for 411 Lakotas, 400 for the Army. More than 330 completed aircraft have been delivered by Airbus Helicopters Inc. from its Columbus, Miss. production facility – all of them on time and on budget.

“From the day we signed the contract to produce the UH-72A, our team has strived every day to deliver on our promises to the Army, to the dedicated soldiers who operate these aircraft, to the U.S. government and the taxpayers,” said Marc Paganini, president and CEO of Airbus Helicopters Inc. “We have delivered a superb aircraft that meets the Army’s performance requirements and quality standards, and we have also delivered on our promise to provide outstanding support to keep the Army’s fleet of Lakotas flying and ready to perform the vital missions they are assigned.”

The Lakota was competitively selected in 2006 to fill a wide variety of missions for the Army and National Guard, including search and rescue, medical evacuation, border security, command and control, VIP transport and general utility. National Guard units operating UH-72As equipped with the Support & Security Mission Equipment Package have been deployed to support Customs and Border Protection missions along the U.S.-Mexico border.

The Lakota is also operated in a training role by the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School. The Army, as part of its Aviation Restructuring Initiative, has selected the Lakota for its Initial Entry Rotary Wing Training program at Fort Rucker. The Royal Thai Army has ordered six UH-72As through the Foreign Military Sales program. Airbus Helicopters is marketing the UH-72A to other countries needing a modern, low cost multi-mission helicopter.

A modern, twin-engine aircraft, the UH-72A is a highly versatile and capable helicopter. It is powerful, but stable with a modern glass cockpit that is compatible with night vision goggles. The Lakota is single-pilot Instrument Flight Rules certified. It has the lowest cost to buy, own and operate of any U.S. military helicopter in production. The Lakota is built in Columbus, Miss. where Airbus Helicopters employs about 250 people, nearly 50 percent of them veterans of the U.S. armed forces."
Video Feature: NHV provides update on H175 entry into service - Vertical Magazine,"Thu, 19 Mar 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvdmlkZW9mZWF0dXJlbmh2cHJvdmlkZXN1cGRhdGVvbmgxNzVlbnRyeWludG9zZXJ2aWNlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This past December marked a significant milestone in Airbus Helicopters’ history — the delivery of the first two H175 (previously known as EC175) helicopters to NHV. Since the aircraft’s delivery, the operator has put more than 500 hours on the helicopters, performing offshore oil-and-gas transport missions.

“Seven days after the delivery of a brand-new aircraft, which was the first model ever, we did our first commercial flight,” NHV CEO Eric Van Hal told Vertical.

NHV is currently operating the helicopters in the Dutch North Sea from its Den Helder, Netherlands base, performing flights at distances up to 180 nautical miles. With the H175’s design offering low vibration and noise levels, alongside Airbus Helicopters’ Helionix avionics suite, feedback from NHV has been overwhelmingly positive.

“With the feedback we have with the entry into service, we have in mind a very bright future,” Airbus Helicopters H175 program director, Marc Allongue told Vertical. “The main feedback we have got from this customer is that this aircraft is very comfortable. Comfortable in terms of vibration, low level of vibration . . . low noise inside the cabin, and also an easy-to-use helicopter.”

Next for the H175 program, Airbus Helicopter has launched VIP and search-and-rescue variants of the helicopter, leading to another partnership with NHV.

“We are looking also to the search-and-rescue version because we have some search-and-rescue contracts and we think this can also be a good opportunity to change to some more adapted aircraft in certain regions,” said Van Hal. “We are working together with Airbus again to develop that.

Why Boeing 747 and Airbus A380 Sales Are Few and Far Between - The Motley Fool,"Sun, 01 Mar 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy9nZW5lcmFsLzIwMTUvMDMvMDEvd2h5LWJvZWluZy03NDctYW5kLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLXNhbGVzLWFyZS1mZXctYW5kLWYuYXNweNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Why buy a gigantic Airbus A380 or Boeing 747 when you can squeeze more seats into a smaller plane instead?

Not too long ago, jumbo jets were considered the flagship products of The Boeing Co. (BA -1.90%) and top rival Airbus.

The Boeing 747 is arguably the most iconic plane of all time, and last year it became the first wide-body aircraft to reach 1,500 deliveries. Airbus entered the jumbo-jet market nearly a decade ago after spending tens of billions of dollars to develop the A380.

Yet A380 sales have fallen far short of projections with 317 orders, compared to Airbus' original market projection of demand for 1,200 planes. Demand for the latest passenger version of the Boeing 747 has been even worse, with just 51 orders since it went on sale nearly a decade ago.

There are a number of reasons why Boeing and Airbus are having so much trouble selling their jumbo jets. But one critical cause has been largely overlooked: the trend among airlines toward increasing seating density.

Adding capacity on key routes

One key idea behind the business case for the Airbus A380 was that air traffic was doubling every 15 years and key airports were getting crowded. Indeed, numerous hub airports in major cities across the world -- including New York, London, Chicago, and Frankfurt -- are at or near their capacity limits for one reason or another.

Airbus figured that if key airport hubs could not accommodate additional flights, then airlines would need bigger planes to meet rising travel demand. Accordingly, it built a plane that was significantly larger than the only other jumbo jet on the market, Boeing's 747.

Airbus markets the A380 with a standard configuration holding 525 passengers in three classes. The maximum capacity is 853 seats. Boeing advertises a capacity of 467 passengers for the 747-8I with a standard three-class configuration -- although it's not an apples-to-apples comparison. (With similar layouts, the 747 would have space for about 405 seats.)

Both jumbo jets are significantly larger than the Boeing 777-300ER, the next-largest plane in production. (Boeing puts its capacity in a three-class configuration at 386 seats.) In theory, this makes the 747 and the A380 good candidates for adding capacity at overcrowded airports.

There's another way

However, airlines have recently discovered an even better way to add capacity -- put more seats on smaller planes. While passengers prefer to have more space, particularly on long-haul flights, most people have not been willing to pay much of a premium for that extra space. Airlines that add seats to their planes have not suffered any long-term backlash.

Thus, Air Canada updated some of its 777-300ERs from a 349-seat configuration to a denser 458-seat configuration. Adding these seats meant shrinking the business class cabin from 42 seats to 36 seats. Some business class seats won't have direct aisle access, unlike the standard configuration. Meanwhile, economy seats will lose an inch of legroom and will be narrower (10 seats per row instead of 9 across).

Yet the discomfort these changes might cause is far outweighed by the more than 30% increase in capacity. Air Canada can offset any deterioration in fares with significantly lower costs per seat.

Not a fair fight

By contrast, the airlines using the Boeing 747-8I and the A380 have generally made them at least as roomy as the ""standard three-class configuration"" models. Lufthansa, the main operator of the 747-8I, outfits them with just 340-386 seats. Most A380s are set up with roughly 500 seats. In the most extreme example, Korean Air places just 407 seats on its A380s!

With comparable seating configurations, the Boeing 777-300ER is slightly more fuel-efficient than either the 747-8I or the A380, according to an analysis by Leeham Co. It also has lower maintenance costs, thanks to having only two engines, while the 747 and A380 are both four-engine planes.

As airlines raise the seating density on their 777s, what began as a minor unit cost gap is becoming a wide gulf. In Air Canada's 458-seat configuration, the Boeing 777-300ER attains a massive unit cost advantage over the 747-8I and the A380. (In fact, Air Canada's 458-seat 777-300ER probably has a cost per seat that is 40%-50% below that of Korean Air's 407-seat A380.)

Still not enough demand

Obviously, jumbo-jet operators could strike back by putting more seats on their 747s and A380s to level the playing field. Indeed, Emirates recently decided to outfit some of its A380s with denser two-class cabins with more than 600 seats.

However, a limited number of routes can handle that much capacity. Furthermore, an A380 seating layout that was truly comparable to Air Canada's dense 777-300ER layout would have more than 700 seats.

Thus, the increase in typical aircraft seating density is a big reason behind the weak A380 and 747-8I sales. Not too long ago, a 777-300ER would normally have been configured with about 300 seats. In that world, there was a clear market for larger, 400-500 seat planes to serve busy, capacity-constrained airports.

With seating density on 777s quickly rising, the market for even larger aircraft is fading. (The next-generation 777-9X will be more sizable and fuel-efficient than the 777-300ER, accelerating this phenomenon.) Airlines have realized they don't necessarily need ""more airplane"" to put more seats on busy routes.

A 400-seat 747 or a 500-seat A380 will clearly be more comfortable for passengers, especially in the cheap seats. But the more that economy-class passengers come to expect that they will be crammed in like sardines, the greater the argument for putting 400-500 seats on a 777 instead. Airlines can't get enough of a premium for the extra space on a jumbo jet to justify the extra cost.

Perhaps there will eventually be enough demand at capacity-constrained airports to create a significant market for 600-800 seat jumbo jets. Until that is the case, Boeing 747 and Airbus A380 orders will probably remain few and far between."
"Airbus A320, plane in French Alps crash, is reliable jet but involved recent crashes - New York Daily News","Tue, 24 Mar 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55ZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzAzLzI0L2FpcmJ1cy1hMzIwLXBsYW5lLWluLWZyZW5jaC1hbHBzLWNyYXNoLWlzLXJlbGlhYmxlLWpldC1idXQtaW52b2x2ZWQtcmVjZW50LWNyYXNoZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus A320, the model of aircraft that crashed Tuesday in the French Alps, is known as an airline industry workhorse that flies short-haul routes worldwide.

Some 3,660 of the planes, which boast a good but not completely clean safety record, are in operation around the world, according to the company.

The single-aisle aircraft typically seats 150 passengers — the number of people believed killed in Tuesday’s Germanwings wreck — and boasts fly-by-wire flight controls “for improved safety and reduced pilot workload, along (with) improved flight smoothness and stability, and fewer mechanical parts.”

It has 0.14 fatal accidents per million takeoffs, a good safety record, according to analysis from Boeing.

Authorities found wreckage of AirAsia Flight QZ8501, an Airbus A320 that crashed in December, in the Java Sea after it took off from Indonesia.

“It’s a delight to fly,” John Cox, a former pilot and CEO of an aviation consulting company, told NBC News. “It’s a highly reliable airplane.”

A total of 18 Airbus A320 planes have been involved in fatal crashes, killing 966 people, since the aircraft was introduced in 1988, according to a database kept by the Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives.

“The A320 has a fantastic safety record,” International Bureau of Aviation president Phil Seymour told CNN after the crash on Tuesday. “There have been a couple of incidents, but generally speaking, they’re safer than most aircraft out there now.”

Details of aviation industry workhorse the Airbus A320

Most recently, 162 people died after an A320, AirAsia flight QZ8501, crashed in December after taking off from Indonesia.

Captain Chesley (Sully) Sullenberger was at the controls of an Airbus A320 when he splash-landed the US Airways jet with 155 people aboard into the Hudson River on Jan. 15, 2009.

That plane lost both engines after flying through a flock of birds shortly after takeoff from LaGuardia Airport and Sullenberger was hailed a hero for keeping all of his passengers alive and uninjured as he expertly steered the plane onto the river.

A Germanwings Airbus A320 was involved in Tuesday’s crash in the French Alps.

An Airbus A320 crash in August 2000 left 143 people dead after a Gulf Air jetliner from Cairo plummeted into the Persian Gulf as it prepared to land in Bahrain.

The Germanwings plane in Tuesday’s crash was 24 years old — near the end of usability for a commercial jet, according to Reuters — and had accumulated about 58,300 flight hours during some 46,700 flights.

Authorities have not said what caused the crash, but the jet, en route from Barcelona to Dusseldorf, plummeted 32,000 feet in eight minutes as it came to rest near the Alps town of Meolans-Revels.

Airbus develops flat-packed cockpit - Professional Engineering,"Thu, 05 Mar 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmltZWNoZS5vcmcvbmV3cy9uZXdzLWFydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLWRldmVsb3BzLWZsYXQtcGFja2VkLWNvY2twaXTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Articles

Airbus has announced its latest pioneering technology - not robotic workers, self-healing composites or advanced avionics, but flat-packed wooden cockpit kits engineers can use for research and development.

The European aircraft maker has revealed that the cockpit mock-up, initially built by systems designer Raphael Andre, has proved so useful that it has been adopted by supply chain companies and several more are to be produced.

Although the cockpit is one of the aircraft's most intensively technical areas, the inexpensive and easily-available mock-up has proved “extremely useful” for early testing of ideas, said the company.

Andre came up with the flat-pack idea while working on cockpit-related research and technology and shopping at Ikea. He said: “After a trip to look at some furniture, it occurred to me that a simple-to-construct, wooden version of a cockpit would do the job very well.”

After the shopping trip Andre designed a version of the cockpit that slots together without the need for any fixings or tools. Dassault Systeme's 3D modelling software package Catia was then used to detail the design. A cardboard version of the cockpit mockup was first produced, followed by the full-sized wooden prototype.



The mock-up has been designed to be easy to put together and transportable



The prototype was ready in just a few days and quickly went into use. An engineer working with automotive manufacturer Continental noticed the kit and saw it would be suitable for use in research looking at the application of automotive safety systems in aviation.

Werner De Rammelaere, an Airbus innovation engineer who works in Emerging Technologies and Concepts, said: “They had been doing research into safety systems that monitor drivers, and we've been working with them to explore possible applications. Continental wanted to use mock-ups and simulators, but there is huge demand on these, so I suggested that they drive over and pick up a cockpit kit instead.”

The kit met all of Continental's requirements, so the team had to make another prototype for themselves. Further use in aircraft development projects is anticipated. Andre added: “We've already had some interest from colleagues in A320 development and there are ergonomic applications too, so we might need more.”"
Germanwings Flight 9525: The unusual nature of the crash - CBS News,"Tue, 24 Mar 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvZ2VybWFud2luZ3MtZmxpZ2h0LTk1MjUtdGhlLXVudXN1YWwtbmF0dXJlLW9mLXRoZS1jcmFzaC_SAVlodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9nZXJtYW53aW5ncy1mbGlnaHQtOTUyNS10aGUtdW51c3VhbC1uYXR1cmUtb2YtdGhlLWNyYXNoLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Germanwings Flight 9525 that crashed in the French Alps on Tuesday took off from Barcelona en route to Dusseldorf around 10 a.m. local time in good weather.

The Airbus A320, with 144 passengers and six crew members on board, leveled out at about 38,000 feet. Shortly after reaching cruising altitude, it went into a steady descent, which it continued on until it was pulverized on the side of a mountain in a remote part of the Alps, killing all on board.

While officials have so far ruled out terrorism as a likely cause of the crash, no explanation has been eliminated. If it wasn't terrorism, the circumstances of the crash are still unusual, according to numerous experts.

Below is a breakdown of the factors that have made the crash stand out so far.

Crashing After Cruising

CBS News national transportation safety expert Mark Rosenker, a former NTSB chairman, reports that passengers have the most to fear when it comes to plane crashes right after takeoff and right before landing.

""It's extraordinarily rare for an airplane to get into trouble and end up in a crash after reaching cruising altitude,"" Rosenker reports.

An estimated 80 percent of plane accidents happen within three minutes after takeoff and eight minutes just before landing. The Associated Press reports that just 10 percent of all plane accidents happen at cruising altitude.

The French Civil Aviation Authority said Flight 9525 lost radio contact at around 10:30 a.m. local time, or about 30 minutes after takeoff, and well before it was supposed to begin its descent into its destination.

At that point in a flight, most planes are in cruise control along a predetermined route.

The Slow Descent

So far, officials have not indicated Flight 9525 went into a wild tailspin or dive before crashing.

CBS News aviation and safety expert Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, who famously landed an Airbus A320 safely in the Hudson River in New York City in 2009, said there are many reasons the plane could have descended -- from instrument malfunctions to smoke in the cockpit.

While it will be impossible to know what happened until the black boxes are analyzed, Sullenberger said the long descent time ""suggests that at least to some extent the pilots were able to control the airplane.""

David Learmount, writing for flightglobal.com, reports that within a few minutes of leveling off at cruising altitude, the plane ""entered a steady descent profile without altering its ground speed to any significant extent from the 420-450kt (780-830km/h) adopted in the cruise. It was not a dramatic descent, but was very steady all the way to impact.""

Additionally, Learmount points out the crash site was not far off from the planned flight route, meaning the plane didn't veer significantly to the left or right during it's descent from 38,000 feet to 6,550 feet, a distance of more than six miles.

Airbus A320 History

CBS News transportation correspondent Jeff Pegues reports the Airbus A320 is considered the ""workhorse"" of the aviation industry.

The single-aisle, twin-engine plane is used typically for flights no more than five hours, and is certified to fly up to 39,000 feet. Airbus says there are 3,606 A320s in operation, including many in the U.S.

The A320 family also has a sterling record of safety, according to a Boeing analysis, with just 0.14 fatal accidents per million takeoffs.

The aircraft that crashed was delivered to Lufthansa in 1991, and had more than 58,000 flight hours in some 46,700 flights, Airbus said. The plane last underwent a routine check in Duesseldorf on Monday, and its last regular full check took place in the summer of 2013.

Pilot Experience

Germanwings CEO Thomas Winkelmann said the pilot, who hasn't been identified yet, had more than 10 years' experience working for Germanwings and its parent airline Lufthansa.

""We cannot say at the moment why our colleague went into the descent, and so quickly and without previously consulting air traffic control,"" said Germanwings' director of flight operations, Stefan-Kenan Scheib.

No Distress Call

It was a control center and not the plane itself that sent out the alert about trouble on board Flight 9525.

Eric Heraud of the French Civil Aviation Authority said the plane lost radio contact at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday, but ""never declared a distress alert itself."" He said the combination of loss of radio contract with a control center and the plane's quick descent prompted the control service to declare a distress situation."
Germanwings Plane Crash: Why It's So Surprising - TIME,"Wed, 25 Mar 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vdGltZS5jb20vMzc1NjA1MS9nZXJtYW53aW5ncy1wbGFuZS1jcmFzaC1zYWZldHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It was one of the safest types of aircraft in operation today, owned by an airline with one of the world’s best safety records. Yet the flight of an Airbus A320 from Spain to Germany still ended in tragedy on Tuesday when it began to plummet rapidly over the French Alps, crashing into mountainous terrain about two kilometers above sea level. All 150 people onboard, including six crew members, are feared dead in the disaster, which could come as a shock to anyone who tries to steer clear of airlines with a history of accidents.

Germanwings was not one of those. Since it was created in 2002, the Cologne-based airline has never had a major air disaster. Its parent company, the leading German carrier Lufthansa, has one of the best safety records in the world, taking 12th place in a ranking of 60 of its international peers in the latest list compiled by the Hamburg-based Jet Airliner Crash Data Evaluation Centre (JACDEC). The last time Lufthansa had a fatal accident was in 1993, when one of its aircraft overshot the runway on a flight from Frankfurt to Warsaw, killing two people on board as the plane caught fire.

The only potential detail of concern to emerge from the reports of Tuesday’s disaster was the age of the ill-fated plane – 24 years – approaching the end of the A320’s usual lifespan of 25-30 years but still within the bounds of international safety regulations.

Over the past year, the sharp decline in the price of oil may has encouraged some global carriers to maintain and fly older planes instead of buying newer models that use less fuel, according to the International Bureau of Aviation, a consultancy based in the U.K. “The lower fuel price may well prove to influence increased maintenance demand if airlines now consider using their older, less fuel efficient aircraft for longer,” the Bureau’s President Phil Seymour said in an analysis of the market last month.

But that would not in itself impact the safety of the A320, which is one of the most widely used and dependable aircraft produced by Airbus. “The maintenance standards inside Lufthansa group are known world-wide as very high,” the head of Germanwings Thomas Winkelmann told reporters on Tuesday. “As long as you have your maintenance schedule in place and follow all the procedures together with the manufacturer, there is absolutely no issue with the age of an airplane.” Just the day before it crashed, the plane was checked out by Lufthansa safety inspectors, Winkelmann said, and the pilot had ten years of experience and more than 6,000 flight hours behind him.

“The A320 has a fantastic safety record,” Seymour of the International Bureau of Aviation said after the crash on Tuesday. “There have been a couple of incidents, but generally speaking, they’re safer than most aircraft out there now.”

That is part of the reason this latest catastrophe has stunned so many. The total number of fatalities in commercial air transport incidents jumped nearly fourfold last year compared to 2013, making it the second deadliest year for air travel in the past decade. But about half of all those fatalities came from the Asia-Pacific region, including the two planes lost by Malaysia Airlines in 2014, according to JACDEC. None of the carriers affected by last year’s string of tragedies was German.

After Tuesday’s crash, however, doubts are likely to emerge about country’s reputation for excellence in transport safety and technological expertise. “We are going through hard hours,” said German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who plans to travel to the crash site on Wednesday.

Rescue teams on the ground have already found one of the plane’s black box recorders, and though it was damaged it still provides hope of clarity on the causes of Tuesday’s disaster. But with an incident like this in the heart of Europe, it is hard to imagine an explanation that would ease the concerns of the travelers and airliners who do their best to fly only the safest planes.

Turkey expects new delays in Airbus A400M delivery - Hurriyet Daily News,"Tue, 24 Mar 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmh1cnJpeWV0ZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS90dXJrZXktZXhwZWN0cy1uZXctZGVsYXlzLWluLWFpcmJ1cy1hNDAwbS1kZWxpdmVyeS04MDA2N9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmh1cnJpeWV0ZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvdHVya2V5LWV4cGVjdHMtbmV3LWRlbGF5cy1pbi1haXJidXMtYTQwMG0tZGVsaXZlcnktODAwNjc?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Turkey expects new delays in Airbus A400M delivery

ISTANBUL-Reuters

Turkey is preparing for further delays in the delivery of two A400M military transport aircraft it ordered from Airbus Group, according to defense officials in Ankara.It signed a deal for 10 of the heavy cargo and troop carriers in 2003 as part of a group of seven European NATO nations, expecting its part of the order to be fulfilled by 2018.After four years of delays in Europe’s largest defense project, Turkey received two of the aircraft in 2014 and was due to receive two more this year. But officials told Reuters that the latest deliveries are now likely to be late.Airbus will have to pay a penalty or offer services for the new delays, they said, without giving a new timeline.“The penalty will depend on the number of days the deliveries are delayed, so the figure is not clear yet. Receiving products and services from the company is also possible,” one of the officials said.Airbus Military is in the process of negotiating a new delivery schedule for the A400M but has not so far published a timetable. However, industry sources say its base production plan of 14 aircraft for this year includes two for Turkey.“We are currently discussing A400M production with all the customers and we will communicate further on that when the discussions are complete,” an Airbus Military spokesman said.Airbus clashed publicly with Turkey over the A400M last year, saying it was Ankara that was delaying taking delivery of the first aircraft as a “bargaining” move.But several buyers, notably Germany, have grown increasingly concerned about the latest round of delays, and analysts say declarations about the troubled project have tended to reflect tough negotiating positions on all sides.Turkey took part in a seven-nation, 3.5-billion-euro bailout in 2010 that was supposed to put an end to chronic delays and technical problems with the European transporter plane.But Airbus acknowledged last year that it faced new delays and in February took a charge of 551 million euros ($618 million).Other European buyers - jointly represented along with Turkey by defence procurement agency OCCAR – include Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg and Spain. Malaysia has also agreed to buy the plane, which fits between the smaller Lockheed Martin C-130 and larger Boeing C-17."
