This Russian jet might just give Boeing and Airbus a run for their money - USA TODAY,"Fri, 12 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdHJhdmVsL3JvYWR3YXJyaW9ydm9pY2VzLzIwMTYvMDIvMTIvdGhpcy1ydXNzaWFuLWpldC1taWdodC1qdXN0LWdpdmUtYm9laW5nLWFuZC1haXJidXMtYS1ydW4tZm9yLXRoZWlyLW1vbmV5LzgzMjg0Mzc2L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This Russian jet might just give Boeing and Airbus a run for their money

When it comes to commercial airplane production, two companies essentially have the industry on lock: American-made Boeing and European-produced Airbus. Boeing's 737, 777 and 787 models — as well as Airbus' A320, A330 and A350 models — dominate airports across the world. Now, a Russian company is seeking to squeeze one of its planes right into the middle of the market.

Russian Rosavia hopes to uproot the foregone notion of these two companies' dominance with an unusually shaped wide-body aircraft called the Frigate Ecojet, designed to fly within the range of a narrow-bodied jet. Because of its oblong width, the Ecojet is able to carry between 276 and 358 passengers per flight, depending on cabin configuration. Rosavia is hoping that the magic number of passengers per flight is somewhere in the middle of those numbers.

By comparison, narrow-body Boeing and Airbus vehicles are built to carry less than 200 passengers on medium-haul routes. Their wide-body jets (747 and A380 excluded) are designed to carry between 240 and 325 passengers, but only on the longest flights currently possible. Rosavia is betting that there is an existing demand in the market for a wide-body jet with the capacity to hold hundreds of passengers, that doesn't need to fly halfway around the world to be financially viable.

The eco in Ecojet isn't a signifier for any sort of particularly green technology. Rather, it is short for economical. The hybrid plane combines the capacity of a wide-body jet with the range and operational savings of a narrow-body.

The oval fuselage my look strange to us today in comparison to the more cylindrical jets we are accustomed to seeing, but Rosavia hopes to change that opinion soon enough.

After completing aerodynamic and structural testing in Germany, Rosavia is scouting locations for an assembly line. The company hopes to begin producing the plane by 2018. Each Ecojet will cost an estimated $120 Million, allowing Rosavia to break even on its investment after the 115th plane is sold. In order to get that far, it will first need to raise $3 Billion in investment.

So will the Frigate Ecojet ever make it off the ground? Is the growing demand for air travel enough to warrant a new contender in the market? Will airlines break with loyalty and tradition to support a newcomer that might require reformatting across much of their existing infrastructure? Only time will tell."
Airbus Bench Designed to Seat Obese Flyers - Fortune,"Tue, 23 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAxNi8wMi8yMy9haXJidXMtc2VhdC1mbGlnaHQtYmVuY2gtcGF0ZW50L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The days of cramped flights soon may be over for overweight travelers.

Airbus Group has filed a patent application earlier this month for a new seating design, one that could relieve the aches and groans of squished globetrotters. The plan would replace airplanes seats with a “reconfigurable passenger bench.”

Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.

The advantage to benches is that they could accommodate passengers of various sizes. Obese flyers, small children, or extra passengers might all fit together in a row, for example.

As the applications details, the bench could be used “for occupation by passengers who require increased space,” including overweight passengers and those with restricted mobility. The bench could also accommodate expanded capacity, such as seating three passengers or families with small children (two adults and two small children, say).

As so, as found in the patent application:

Airlines seats have shrunk several inches over the past few decades. At the same time, obesity rates in America have been on the rise. The combination has made for an uncomfortable trend on flights: cramming more mass into less space.

Then again, airlines could just make the regular seats bigger."

Andrew: Hello, welcome to Robots Podcast! Can you introduce yourself and describe what you do?

Curtis: I’m Curtis Carson and I’m responsible for the research and technology on the industrial system side with Airbus in France. My role encompasses everything you can imagine around the production of a commercial aircraft from jigs machinery equipment to robotics automation to new innovative techniques, enhancing and optimizing through IOT and connected objects.

Andrew: What is IOT?

Curtis: Internet of things, so connectedness and bridging multiple sensors and systems around our worker or automation on our shop floor.

Andrew: For people who aren’t familiar with Airbus, could you describe your products?

Curtis: There’s a high likelihood if you’ve travelled anywhere, it was one of our Airbus products. We develop commercial aircrafts from a smaller range, which we call single aisle aircraft A320, to the world’s largest passenger aircraft, the A380.

Andrew: What are the challenges in manufacturing aircraft?

Curtis: It might be hard to imagine from an outside perspective, but some of crafts have been developed years ago and we’ve been producing them for many, many years. Our new and innovative products, like our A350, have just gone to our first customers and the industrial system that we built behind to produce all this is quite large. But also expansive in terms of footprint and age and the diversity, is quite significant. We’re not building a factory every year and we’re not designing new aircraft each year. This makes it challenging to find ways to innovate.

Andrew: You said that the lifetime can be significant. What is the average time one aircraft design might be in production?

Curtis: It is quite typical for an aircraft design to be in production for 20, 30 years or more. The time frames are large to very long, the more successful the program the longer the production.

Andrew: How many aircraft does Airbus produce in a year?

Curtis: It was over 630+ aircraft produced last year. This might seem like a small number versus an automotive domain – where you’re producing thousands and thousands of cars – but this is some of the largest quantities of commercial aircrafts ever produced in a given period, or a given year.

Andrew: How many aircraft are currently in the backlog to be purchased from Airbus?

Curtis: I think it’s close to 7,000 aircrafts in backlog for production time-frame, don’t quote me on that. If you take the numbers per year, the backlog is over quite a number of years.

Andrew: To address the large number of aircraft currently in the backlog, what are some initiatives Airbus is undertaking for its manufacturing processes?

Curtis: We’re looking to innovate assembly process in the building of aircraft that are part of that building process and it might be difficult to see this without looking at really what’s inside a production system. As well as looking into automation to help people, or robotics and automation that we can use to assemble and fabricate parts of the aircraft.

We’re looking from across different facets of innovation: from smart tools, that know where they are in the aircraft; to autonomous robotics systems, that can manage and move themselves around in our production environment; to innovative technologies, like 3D printing and what it can bring to production efficiency and performance in the building of our aircraft. We’re looking across a large spectrum of technologies and see how we can effectively boost our productivity and our performance in building our aircraft.

Andrew: What robotics initiatives has Airbus undertaken in the past?

Curtis: In the area of robotics we’re using industrial robots and systems you may see if you were in an automotive environment for specific tasks – like drilling holes on a panel or a skin structure to assemble frames on the aircraft – we have big machines that we use today for building large scale composite parts up to the size of wings. We have a number of different automated systems we use. These are the typical industrial automations that we’re applying. With those typical industrial automations we can target a small percentage of the production activities to the large quantity of parts you can have in an aircraft, and the large diversity of the types of parts.

That’s what exists today. What we’re moving towards is where we can have more light-weight robotic systems that are flexible and agile. Systems that can move in and around our structures versus designing from the ground up a fixed and rigid system… instead you have a robot from within. Once you realize the size and the scale of the aircraft, you’ll see it’s not something that’s readily set up to bring the product to the robot or for the robot to do the work, and then move the product along. We have to be more agile and flexible in our building process.

Andrew: Airbus is sponsoring this year’s challenge at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation. Can you tell us about that?

Curtis: The competition we are proposing this year is drilling. Why would we target something like drilling? The simple answer is by looking at the production in Airbus in assembling the aircraft I mentioned earlier. We’re drilling over 120 million holes per year. Of those 120 million holes I would say we’re only able to automate a small percentage in terms of production tasks. There’s a high level of manual drilling we still do in the production of our aircraft today. Drilling is an interesting aspect. If we can combine what I said earlier – a lightweight and mobile robotic system – and combine with lightweight tools, then we have an opportunity to move into a new arena, and potential. We could implement an automated system without changing our infrastructure or our production lines to accommodate such a system.

A lot of these holes are drilled today by people. It’s not that a large industrial robot wouldn’t work doing that job, but it is not very mobile. And if you make the robot mobile, well it’s still heavy! If you’re drilling holes inside an aircraft structure barrel, it becomes difficult to put the robot inside without rebuilding your industrial infrastructure. This is what we’re interested to see: how can we push the boundaries of robotics capabilities today in this lightweight mobile module and solve these activities? Drilling is just the start. If we can do it with drilling, we can look to other aspects in production operations.

Andrew: In the competition itself, what are you asking teams to do?

Curtis: What we setup might look very simple, but the technical complexities come if we have a metal template. We’re asking them to produce a specific drilling pattern. In this drilling pattern we are asking to produce an automated system with bounding frame or restrictions with regards to size, mass, points for modularity. Then, looking at how quickly they can manipulate the system towards the task. If I have a pattern of holes to drill, how fast can they drill? What’s the level of quality? We’re very, very interested not only to have high speed, but quality.

We need precision. If we adjust the environment and the positions of these templates how can they master their robotic system to accommodate these different positions? How would they simulate the complexities of the geometry and the environment that we’re drilling on? I think for us and during the activities, we’re looking for a robotics system not doing just one task in a repeated mode, over and over, in one position. The types of automation we need, especially when it comes to drilling, are having high volume of repeated drilling tasks over a wide range of different positions.

Andrew: I understand that the robots are to be modular in their end effectors and weigh less than 100kg and you’ve mentioned reasons for both. I did want to ask: why are you asking people to provide open source software to actually control these robots?

Curtis: I would say the simple approach is there in the production context we have today and you see it in a number of industries. With this approach we can look at getting the best of the best. You mentioned end effector. Instead of thinking about a closed complete system that we would go buy and maybe the company we’re buying from is advanced in the modular robotic arm system. However, they don’t develop end effectors. The standard approach in most industries would mean we go buy from a supplier and package. It’s not that it doesn’t work, it can work. But what happens when better end effectors comes along? Or we have another company that’s able to do end effectors better than the company that is integrating the robot and end effectors of the 1st system?

Well, it becomes difficult and complicated to figure out how to benefit from such an innovative change on the current system. We see the same thing in terms of the software, the control, the algorithms, whatever goes inside. Imagine also we have a huge IT infrastructure on our side across many different aspects of the production lifecycle and this is another level of complexity when it’s closed. We’re then in a mode where we develop each time we have a new system or solution we have to develop a very specific interface for such a solution.

There are a number of different reasons, but I would say 1st and foremost we want to capture the best capability from the best in the world, wherever they are, for what they’re good at. It’s not common to find somebody that’s good at every single aspect being on all those aspects.

Andrew: It sounds like a large part of this is foreign partnerships. Are you looking more so towards academia or industry, of a mix of both?

Curtis: I would say if we’re really good at it, it will be both. Sometimes you can discover innovative things coming out of industry but you can discover interesting things coming out of academia. I don’t think that’s by surprise; academia and industry are linked in a number of different ways and means. A lot of the new businesses you see in today’s start-up world are from academia. What we’re looking for out there is how can we help stimulate towards academia and/or the outside world?

Where are our challenges, what are we looking to resolve and help that makes it feasible? This is also a good reason for the open approach. The more we are open in accessibility to the outside world, whether academia or businesses, the more opportunities and people that could potentially propose ideas that, perhaps, we didn’t think of in resolving. It creates a level playing field for small start-ups to be just as powerful and effective at proposing something valuable versus the big business and industry we’re used to working with today. It creates opportunity.

Andrew: Beyond just the drilling task that’s been selected for this competition, what are some places where you might see innovation being needed? Or a new approach beyond just making something that’s practical and useful in an industrial setting, but a whole new capability entirely?

Curtis: I guess it depends on what you mean by a whole new capability. What we look for today is predominantly driven by what we’ve already designed and producing. The aspect that we’re not deeply looking from this type of competition is okay. We’re talking about optimizing the current state of our product based upon how it designed. The design may have been a number of years ago, or 5 years ago. How do you combine those new capabilities and products, materials, or techniques? You use the capabilities in the design of the product that you’re doing and optimize both at the same time.

Andrew: As you think about your current production process, what are some examples of other low hanging fruit processes that could be adapted to use these technologies we’ve discussed?

Curtis: The minute we talk about drilling, the next thing is fastening. We have millions of fasteners we’re replacing. We do a lot of surface treatments or ceilings or applying ceilings joints. Painting requires a high demand in terms of manual effort and activity. If you’re painting, then have sanding and abrasion processes. Due to the size and the structure there are confined spaces and restricted access spaces. There are a number of non-ergonomic conditions the workers are in today. This is the whole domain and area of potential when we talk about robotics, especially light weight or new generations of robotics where you see lightweight in modular and adaptable types of systems. We have a huge playing field in terms of opportunity.

Andrew: How would you see the robots and the people interacting as they assemble an aircraft?

Curtis: The approach we focus on is that we don’t believe, at least today, in having a factory full of robots, and that’s it. We’re looking at worker-robot collaboration. We start from our worker, the person doing the work. How can we enable him to be more effective, better, efficient in his day to day job? It’s like a partner. Any difficult and non-human friendly tasks we can pass to the robot. We can ease the non-ergonomic conditions and reduce the repetitive and straining activities from workers. It’s a combination and collaboration.

We know that as robotics systems evolve they’ll be able to do a little bit more. At the same time, like what I mentioned at the beginning, it’s not just about a robot with a worker, it’s also how we can use the new connectivity of internet of things and connected objects and advanced communication to enable the worker to be more efficient and have the right information in a more dynamic way. Whether it’s through Google Glasses or wearable computing, or sensors in the manual drillers showing the quality of the hole they drilled. These types of automated systems allow a new feedback process for the operator to do the job the best he can.

Andrew: Could you give us a story or an illustration of what you imagine a worker in this future factory might to on a daily basis that would utilize these technologies, like, internet of things and the general ability to have more information?

Curtis: I would say the easiest way is just to give you a glimpse of what we’re preparing today. We have tests in preparation for one of our production environments where we will have electronically controlled smart tools. For example, a torqueing wrench for finishing the fastener or a manual drilling pistol for making the hole, with wearable devices. We will equip to three stations or more in one of our production lines and allow them to experience what tomorrow could look like.

The reason I like to focus on the aspect of tomorrow is because it’s not 5 years from now. We have the potential to incrementally put something in place today. What we’re preparing and doing now is the first production trials to see how it would be implemented in day to day for business for our workers.

Andrew: What do you see as the timeline? If tomorrow is the system you’ve just described what is 5 years from now, 10 years, or 30 years?

Curtis: It’s difficult for me to project that far ahead. But five years from I don’t think it’s too far-fetched to imagine that connected objects and types of automation will be a prevalent, common thing in any of our production facilities. It could be that tools you might see today like working from paper or drawings, you won’t see. I imagine you’d see a much cleaner environment. You’d see what we consider a high-tech environment in terms of tools, equipment, digital displays, progress tracking interfaces they’re using to prepare job flow of parts to the job that they’re doing.

I would imagine it’s hard to describe it in words unless you visualize and see what a production facility looks like today. I would imagine the proliferation of such devices is not on a linear scale. You would see it more in an expediential implementation and growth. This is one of the good reasons to consider the open approach. We must have a way, if we want to be fast. It has to be designed in a way that can allow this evolution to happen easily and quickly for robotics systems or connected objects and digital thread that we could use with our workers.

Andrew: In order to keep pace with that expediential rate of improvement, how serious is Airbus in investing in these opportunities? What would you guess would be the activity in the next few years?

Curtis: We’re serious about it, and the challenge is just a glimpse into why we’re motivated in this domain. The challenges are real, it’s a real challenge. It’s a real problem that we face today. It’s not something just made up to make a contest for the ICRA event. It’s a real potential application for our shuffler. When it comes to the digitization and the production efficiency and connectivity, we’re very serious about it and we have a number of initiatives running.

Andrew: On an economic scale people could also be interested, like how much has been spent or planned to be spent. Professors or companies look to the future and will think about possibly partnering with Airbus.

Curtis: I don’t know if I can put a figure to it, but I would say the best way to see how committed we are to it is to open up a dialogue; ask us! As us in your domain area! It really depends on the value we can potentially get, or bring from it.

We have significant portfolios of research and development activity running on platforms and cooperation with universities, technology centers, businesses. There is a significant amount of activity happening. I can’t really quote to the figures to be honest.

Andrew: ICRA is the 15 – 21 May in Stockholm, Sweden. When will you be accepting submissions to be part of this competition?

Curtis: Our submission window for ICRA is open today through March 15th when we’ll close the submission process.

Andrew: For these teams, what kind of support is available from the competition?

Curtis: We’re offering, in certain circumstances, the possibility to any registered team to apply for help with travel, equipment, materials or tools. It depends on the potential and ideas by the teams. We judge it on the case-by-case basis with the teams who register. There is potential for support, but it requires registering and then talking with us.

Andrew: Where can people find registration forms and more information about the event?

Curtis: They can go directly to the ICRA 2016 homepage to find the link to the Airbus group webpage. The webpage provides details and process for registering, a general description about the contest, prizes and scoring. The best place is directly on the ICRA webpage.

Andrew: Thank you for joining us and putting together the Airbus Shop Floor Challenge! We look forward to seeing the results at this year’s ICRA!

Curtis: Thank you for having me! I’m excited to see the final results from our competitors.

Equatorial Guinea Acquires Two Airbus C-295 Aircraft - Defense News,"Tue, 09 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXIvMjAxNi8wMi8wOS9lcXVhdG9yaWFsLWd1aW5lYS1hY3F1aXJlcy10d28tYWlyYnVzLWMtMjk1LWFpcmNyYWZ0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"DAVID WILL PUBLISH

GABORONE, Botswana — The government of Equatorial Guinea acquired two Airbus C-295 aircraft with one ear-marked for deployment in troop transportation while the other is set to fly maritime surveillance missions over the Economic Exclusive Zone (EEZ) of the Gulf of Guinea island nation.

Quoting a government statement, media in Malabo reported last week that the agreement was signed following a meeting held between the government and Airbus Defense and Space representatives at the company's aerospace manufacturing facility in Seville, Spain.

The first aircraft is due for delivery in September 2016.

""This trip [was] in accordance with the desire of the government to strengthen security measures around the coastal areas of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea,"" the government statement read. ""The government of Equatorial Guinea has acquired two military aircraft for the transportation of troops and the surveillance of national territory,""

The agreement also covers the provision of training and support services for Equatorial Guinea crews who will operate and maintain the aircraft.

The acquisition makes Equatorial Guinea the second major West African buyer of the C-295 after Ghana, which already operates one and is believed to be seeking two more to meet the airlift needs of troops engaged in United Nations peacekeeping missions.

The new aircraft will bring additional capabilities to the island nation's air force, which operates a small fleet made up of old Antonov An-72 transport, four Sukhoi Su-25 combat aircraft and two Aero Vodochody L-39 jet trainers.

The country also is actively seeking new attack, trainer and transport helicopters as it prepares to take part in United Nations peacekeeping missions in Africa."
Mille and Airbus Create a Watch for Highfliers (Published 2016) - The New York Times,"Mon, 22 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTYvMDIvMjMvZmFzaGlvbi9yaWNoYXJkLW1pbGxlLWFpcmJ1cy13YXRjaGVzLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"At first glance, watchmaking and aviation would seem to occupy opposite ends of the manufacturing spectrum. And yet the watchmaker Richard Mille, whose Swiss brand is best known for fashioning avant-garde timepieces from space-age materials, found enough similarities between the two worlds to co-design a watch with Airbus Corporate Jets, or ACJ.

As the ACJ managing director, Benoit Defforge, put it: “We have the same kind of customer.”

The result of their two-year collaboration, introduced at the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie in Geneva in January, is the 30-piece limited edition RM 50-02 ACJ Tourbillon Split Seconds Chronograph, available exclusively at Richard Mille boutiques for a staggering $1.05 million.

The relationship between the two brands, neither of which had ever engaged in a partnership of this nature, began after a friend of Mr. Mille’s put him in touch with Mr. Defforge. For the French watchmaker, teaming with the aircraft manufacturer based in Toulouse, France, was something of a fantasy. “I’m totally mad about Airbus,” he said. “I’ve been a hundred times around the globe. Still, when I see their aircraft I am like a baby.”

The challenge was “to identify the parts of the plane that you could bring to a watch,” Mr. Defforge said. “We wanted to give the feeling that this watch is an Airbus Corporate Jet, not a watch with Airbus Corporate Jets written on it.”"
The A330's continued commercial success leads to a new production rate increase - Airbus,"Wed, 24 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE2LTAyLXRoZS1hMzMwcy1jb250aW51ZWQtY29tbWVyY2lhbC1zdWNjZXNzLWxlYWRzLXRvLWEtbmV3LXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tcmF0ZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has announced a production rate increase for its A330 Family, responding to new commercial successes that underscore this versatile widebody product line’s popularity with customers around the globe.

Taking effect in January 2017, the change will raise production from its current level – six aircraft per month – to a monthly rate of seven. As of 31 January, Airbus had booked orders for 1,610 A330s, of which 1,261 had been delivered.

“The A330 has enjoyed additional commercial success in China, Saudi Arabia and South Africa among other countries. Add to that healthy demand for the MRTT military derivative and you have an order book that can easily absorb an increase of one aircraft per month,” said Eric Zanin, Head of the A330 Family Programme.

Airbus’ A330 Family has five in-service members: the A330-200 and longer-fuselage A330-300 commercial jetliner versions, A330-200F freighter, ACJ330 corporate jet and A330 multi-role tanker transport (MRTT) aircraft; along with two highly-efficient A330neo (New Engine Option) versions in development: the A330-800neo and A330-900neo.

Planned for first deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2017, the A330neo aircraft will expand operators’ market opportunities with a range capability increase of up to 400 nautical miles, and offer better economics than its competitors while also providing an inch greater seat-width in economy class for improved passenger comfort.

Zanin said the increase will become “real” mid-way through 2016 when component production reaches the new level."

Airbus has started final assembly of the first A350-1000 on schedule at the A350 XWB Final Assembly Line (FAL) in Toulouse, France. This A350-1000, one of three flight test aircraft to be built, will take to the skies for its maiden flight before the end of 2016. A350-1000 deliveries will start in mid-2017.To ensure the smooth integration of the A350-1000 into the FAL while A350-900 production is ramping-up, Airbus has added three additional final assembly stations. For maximum flexibility, all stations in the A350 XWB FAL can be used for both models.Currently in “Station 50” for fuselage join-up and nose landing gear installation, the first A350-1000 will next move to “Station 40” where the wings, main landing gear, pylons and tail planes will be installed. To save time and optimise the A350 assembly process, Airbus starts the cabin furnishing and first electrical power-on in parallel to the structural assembly work. After this stage is completed, the aircraft continues through the FAL process, with final structural activities, ground tests, painting, cabin & cockpit completion and engines installation before being transferred to the flight test centre.While having a very high degree of commonality with the A350-900, the A350-1000, measuring nearly 74 meters from nose to tail, is the longest fuselage version of Airbus’ all-new family of wide body jetliners. The A350-1000 will be powered by Rolls Royce Trent XWB-97 engines, the most powerful engine developed for an Airbus aircraft. The A350-1000 comfortably seats 366 passengers in a typical 3-class configuration and flies on routes of up to almost 8,000 nautical miles which represents a significant revenue-generating advantage for operators. So far, Airbus has won 181 A350-1000 orders from 10 customers."

First Alabama-made Airbus moves from production to paint | Made in Alabama - Made In Alabama,"Thu, 25 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hZGVpbmFsYWJhbWEuY29tLzIwMTYvMDIvZmlyc3QtYWxhYmFtYS1tYWRlLWFpcmJ1cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The first Alabama-made Airbus aircraft should make a maiden flight in Mobile this spring, followed by delivery to its owner, JetBlue Airways. That delivery will be followed by six other Alabama-made A321 aircraft, all with the conventional engine option (ceo), to be delivered to American Airlines, according to Airways News.

Airbus’ Alabama workforce started assembling the first aircraft shortly after the plane’s major components arrived at the Port of Mobile last June via cargo ship from Europe. Assembly was already well under way in September, when France-based Airbus held a grand-opening ceremony for its only U.S. manufacturing facility.

“Mobile is our industrial home,” Airbus Group Chairman and CEO Allan McArtor said at the time.

Airbus has said the Alabama manufacturing facility will be initially dedicated to producing the A321, the largest variant of its twin-engine, narrow-body A320 family. By the end of 2017, Airbus plans to reach a production rate of four aircraft per month in Mobile.

Further orders for the aircraft from the Philippines are possible. Market analysts Forecast International say the C-295 is a leading contender alongside its Airbus stablemate, the smaller CN-235, to be acquired for maritime patrol duties monitoring Chinese activity around disputed islands in the South China Sea. Forecast International said six maritime patrol aircraft (MPA) aircraft are required with funding for the first two units already approved.

The C-295 is a multirole platform that has already secured MPA orders from Chile, Portugal and Oman. The analysts said that last year, the Philippines was also reported to be in talks with Japan over buying second-hand Lockheed Martin P-3Cs.

In another development, Airbus announced it had made its first C-295 sale of the year with a deal for one winglet-equipped transport aircraft to the Mali Air Force. The performance-improving winglets are now standard on the C-295.

Delivery to the African country is scheduled for the second half of this year, said Airbus.

Airbus strengthens leadership position in Asia-Pacific region - Airbus,"Tue, 16 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNi0wMi1haXJidXMtc3RyZW5ndGhlbnMtbGVhZGVyc2hpcC1wb3NpdGlvbi1pbi1hc2lhLXBhY2lmaWMtcmVnaW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus strengthened further its market leading position in Asia-Pacific in 2015, winning 421 net orders from 17 airlines and lessors in the region during the year. This represented 39 per cent of the company’s net order intake in 2015 for 1,080 aircraft.



In addition, the manufacturer delivered 282 new aircraft to 40 operators across the region over the twelve month period, either directly or via leasing companies. This was 44 per cent of the company’s total output of 635 aircraft during the year, reflecting the importance of the region to the manufacturer.



The regional results were announced today by Fabrice Brégier, Airbus President and CEO and John Leahy, Chief Operating Officer, Customers on the opening of the Singapore Air Show.



“The Asia-Pacific region has traditionally been one of our strongest markets,” said Fabrice Brégier. “In recent years we have consolidated our position with our complete range of modern and efficient products. We expect this trend to continue in the coming years, especially in the widebody market where the A350 XWB is setting new standards in the 300 - 400 seat category.”



Looking to the future, Airbus expects the Asia-Pacific region to continue to lead demand for new aircraft over the next 20 year period.



Presenting the company’s latest forecast for the region, John Leahy said that an annual increase in passenger traffic of 5.6% would contribute to a requirement for some 12,800 new aircraft valued at USD 2 trillion. This represents 40% of global demand for 32,600 aircraft over the next 20 years, and includes almost half of all widebody deliveries worldwide and over a third of all single aisle aircraft.



“Asia-Pacific will continue to experience stronger growth than any other world region as more people fly more often,” said John Leahy. “Airbus will be especially well placed to respond to this demand in every size category. From 100 to over 500 seats, and for everything from short regional flights to the world’s longest commercial services, we have the right products to meet the needs of airlines in this fast-growing market.”



Over the past 10 years Airbus has recorded the leading share of sales in the Asia-Pacific region in both the single aisle and widebody markets. This has seen the A320 Family account for 64 per cent of net orders in the single aisle category, while the Airbus widebody aircraft, the A330, A350 XWB and A380 have together won 56 per cent of orders during this timeframe.



The complete Airbus product line comprises the best-selling A320 Family in the single aisle market, the popular A330 and all-new A350 XWB in the mid-size widebody category and the flagship A380 in the very large aircraft segment. In the freight market Airbus currently offers the new-build A330-200F and the A330 Passenger-to-Freighter (A330P2F) programme.

Asia-Pacific 20 Year Market Forecast - Headline Figures• 5.6% annual growth in passenger traffic (global average 4.6%)• Asia-Pacific fleet will grow from 5,600 today to 14,000• Demand for 12,810 new aircraft valued at USD 2 trillion• 40% of total world demand for 32,600 aircraft over next 20 years• 3,760 twin aisle and 720 very large aircraft = 46% of global widebody demand (9,600)• 8,330 single aisle aircraft = 36% of global single-aisle demand (23,000)

Speaking at the Singapore Airshow, Fabrice Bregier said Airbus and its competitors are not facing a downturn in orders from airlines. Stock markets and oil have slumped since the beginning of the year, in a sign of investor anxiety about the health of the world economy.

""I think it is simple and it is clear that there are tensions around the world. And so people try to project themselves into the future and impact on air traffic,"" he said. ""As a matter of fact, we don't see it, our competitors don't see it, our customers don't see it. We've never been so healthy.""

The company forecasts demand for 12,810 new airplanes in the Asia-Pacific area, valued at $2 trillion over the next 20 years. That represents 40 percent of forecast global demand for about 32,600 airplanes over the same period.

Airbus expects passenger numbers in Asia to grow by 5.6 percent annually, with China forecast to post double-digit growth.

Bregier was presenting the manufacturer's latest outlook on the first day of the Singapore Airshow, which ends Feb. 21. More than 1,000 companies, including Airbus and Boeing (BA) are participants. The previous show in 2014 generated deals worth $32 billion.

John Leahy, an Airbus chief operating officer, said the manufacturer was not seeing any deferrals of jet orders in the region, whose middle class is driving growth in the airline industry.

""They fly for business, they have disposable income, they fly for pleasure, and they are the ones who are sitting in the seats of airliners around the world,"" he said. ""There's a growing middle class in China. The middle class in Asia Pacific will be driving the world going forward.""

Airbus adjusted its 2015 numbers, saying it had 1,080 net orders compared with the previously announced 1,036. It has a backlog of 6,831 orders worth $1 trillion at list prices, though customers usually negotiate discounts.

Boeing said Monday that it had no deferrals in Asia and forecasts demand for 3,750 new airplanes in Southeast Asia alone, valued at $550 billion over the next 20 years. Of the forecast demand, 76 percent will be for single-aisle aircraft such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320."

Could Russia’s Frigate Ecojet take on Airbus and Boeing? - CNN,"Tue, 09 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvZnJpZ2F0ZS1lY29qZXQtcnVzc2lhLWF2aWF0aW9uL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAUVodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi90cmF2ZWwvYXJ0aWNsZS9mcmlnYXRlLWVjb2pldC1ydXNzaWEtYXZpYXRpb24?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CNN —

The design and manufacture of large commercial aircraft is one of the world’s most challenging industries.

Two aviation giants dominate the field: U.S.-based Boeing and European consortium Airbus.

So can a Russian upstart succeed in its goal of redefining the market with a new aircraft concept whose unique characteristics place it in a category of its own?

The new manufacturer is Moscow-based private company is Rosavia.

Its concept is the inelegantly named Frigate Ecojet.

Wide body vs. narrow body

Airliners can be roughly divided into two groups.

There are wide-body aircraft, like the Boeing 777 and 787 or Airbus A330 and A350 families, designed to carry 250 or more passengers on long-haul flights.

Then there are narrow-body aircraft: smaller single-aisle craft usually seating fewer than 200 passengers and serving short- and medium-haul routes.

The Boeing 737 and Airbus 320 families are the most common in this category.

But what if an airline needs to transport a large number of passengers over relatively short distances?

One option is to use a wide-body airline – much heavier than required for short distances.

The other is to use narrow-body aircrafts, flying at greater frequency, and to give up some of the economies of scale that high-density routes can afford.

Neither is an ideal solution.

Russian tradition

The Frigate Ecojet aims to bridge this market gap by combining the capacity of a wide-body aircraft with the economics and range of a narrow-bodied one.

It’s been designed to fly between 276 and 358 passengers over distances of 3,000 to 4,000 nautical miles, depending on the model.

Although currently a private company, Rosavia follows the tradition of Russia’s aircraft design bureaus.

Some of its senior technical personnel were involved in the roll-out of airliners such as the medium-range Tupolev Tu-204 and the Tu-214.

If its positioning as a medium-haul wide-body airliner sets the Frigate Ecojet apart in the market, its most eye-catching feature is without doubt its curved fuselage.

Rosavia’s engineers say its elliptic shape is a particularly efficient solution for seating more than 350 passengers in a three-aisle configuration, while keeping weight and dimensions below those of wide-body aircraft of similar capacity.

The main challenge the Frigate Ecojet faces isn’t technical, though, but commercial.

Is there enough demand for an aircraft with these characteristics?

Niche market

Yes, but a limited one, says Daniel Tsang, aviation expert and founder of consultancy firm Aspire Aviation.

He says it’s the same terrain that Boeing is purportedly examining as part of a long-term plan to develop a new mid-size airplane.

“While such a market has a demand for up to 2,000 airplanes over the next 20 years, it will remain niche,” says Tsang.

Nevertheless, managers at Frigate Ecojet hope to capture a piece of this action.

They see most of the demand coming from Asia, where the Frigate Ecojet could serve the growth in high-density routes between the region’s major cities.

Tsang remains skeptical that the cost savings brought about by the Ecojet could be large enough to prevent Boeing and Airbus from covering the market gap with re-engined versions of their existing jets.

He says that the question is “whether developing a clean-sheet small-twin is the best solution to addressing the niche market needs.”

In his view, the re-engined Airbus A321neo and Boeing 737-900ER will be able to cover most of the demand.

Throw in the Airbus A330neo, whose development cost is fully paid for, and the business case looks even shakier.

Plowing ahead

In any case, Rosavia is plowing ahead with its plans to serially produce the Frigate Ecojet, and hopes to be operational by 2018.

The company has already successfully completed the first round of aerodynamic and structural tests in Germany, with the cooperation of several engineering partners, and it’s now looking for a suitable location for its assembly line.

With a catalog price of $120 million, on a par with the smaller Airbus A321neo, Frigate Ecojet’s program leader Alexander Klimov expects the project to break even at 115 aircraft.

He says the company will need $3 billion investment over the next 10 years.

It’s open, he adds, to discussing financial or industrial partnerships.

That could lead to the company relocating to another European country or to Asia to take advantage of favorable local conditions.

Bold ambition

There’s no doubt that the Frigate Ecojet is a bold and ambitious undertaking, even more so when considering it’s being led by an independent private company.

However, it’s precisely this slice of the market that saw the beginning of one of the most successful growth stories in the history of commercial aviation.

Although the market and political environment is vastly different, it’s easy to forget – four decades after the first Airbus A300 took to the skies – that once upon a time the mighty and diversified Airbus Group also started with a medium-haul wide-body airliner designed for the same tasks that the Frigate Ecojet now hopes to fulfill."

Revenues up six percent to € 64 billion; EBIT* before one-off € 4.1 billion

Earnings per share rise 15 percent to € 3.43

Proposed 2015 dividend € 1.30 per share, up eight percent from 2014

Free cash flow € 2.8 billion, including € 1.7 bn proceeds from Dassault Aviation stake sale

Record order backlog supports ramp-up

Guidance 2016 confirms outlook

Airbus Group SE (stock exchange symbol: AIR) reported solid 2015 results with its guidance achieved for all key performance indicators, reflecting continued operational improvement.

“The 2015 results reflect our solid financial and operational performance. We have delivered on our commitments and have maintained our outlook for 2016 and beyond,” said Tom Enders, Airbus Group Chief Executive Officer.

“Revenues and EBIT increased from a year earlier, delivering earnings per share growth while free cash flow improved. The record order book supports our commercial aircraft ramp-up plans and we are driving operational efficiency.

We have now decided to increase the A330 production rate back to seven aircraft a month in 2017. There was also strong momentum in defence and space, with a book-to-bill ratio above 1. Operational highlights included reaching breakeven on the A380 programme for the first time, delivering 14 A350s in the first year of industrialisation and receiving dual certification for the A320neo. We remain focused on programme execution and managing the challenges we face with the acceleration of the A350 and A400M ramp-ups and A320neo transition. We will increase shareholder returns with a proposed dividend of 1.30 euros a share and our current share buyback.”

Group order intake(1) in 2015 was € 159 billion (2014: € 166 billion), with the order book(1) value reaching a record € 1,006 billion as of 31 December 2015 (year-end 2014: € 858 billion).

Airbus received 1,080 net commercial aircraft orders (2014: 1,456 net orders), including 136 A330s. The 2015 gross orders of 1,190 aircraft included three A380s for new customer ANA. After 50 governmental helicopter cancellations, Airbus Helicopters received 333 net orders (2014:369 units) including 107 H145s and 36 H175s. Order intake by value rose 18 percent at Airbus Defence and Space, with bookings including 14 additional A330 MRTTs and five telecommunications satellites. During the year, an agreement was also signed with OneWeb for 900 small telecommunications satellites.

Group revenues increased six percent to € 64.5 billion (2014: € 60.7 billion). This was mainly driven by Commercial Aircraft which registered an eight percent rise in revenues on higher deliveries of 635 aircraft (2014: 629 units), including 14 A350 XWBs, and the strengthening U.S. dollar. Despite lower overall deliveries of 395 units (2014: 471 units), Helicopters’ revenues rose four percent and mainly reflected a higher level of services activities. Defence and Space’s revenues were broadly stable despite the de-consolidation of launcher revenues with the creation of the Airbus Safran Launchers Joint Venture’s first phase. A total of 11 A400M military transport aircraft were delivered in 2015.

Group EBIT* before one-off(3) – an indicator capturing the underlying business margin by excluding material non-recurring charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes and restructurings or foreign exchange impacts – rose to € 4,132 million (2014: € 4,066 million) with increases in all Divisions compensating the lower Dassault Aviation contribution.

Commercial Aircraft’s EBIT* before one-off rose 10 percent to € 2,780 million (2014: € 2,529 million), reflecting a solid operational performance that included the A380 breakeven and cost control. Helicopters’ EBIT* before one-off increased to € 427 million (2014: € 413 million), as lower deliveries were compensated by higher services activities, a favourable mix and progress on the Division’s transformation plan. Defence and Space’s EBIT* before one-off rose 15 percent to € 1,060 million (2014: € 920 million), driven by strong programme execution across all business lines and progress with its transformation plan.

Group self-financed R&D expenses totalled € 3,460 million (2014: € 3,391 million).

The A350 XWB production ramp-up is accelerating, with a strong focus on the supply chain performance, controlling and reducing the level of outstanding work and managing recurring costs to target. This remains challenging. Joint European and U.S. certification for the A320neo was received in the fourth quarter of 2015 with the first delivery following in January 2016. Despite some schedule setbacks, the A320neo ramp-up preparation is underway with the focus on maturity and service readiness for early operations in line with customer expectations. Deliveries will be back-loaded this year. The A400M programme is in the ramp-up phase. Industrial efficiency and military capability remains a challenge during this phase.

The Group is working with its customers to agree a schedule of military capability enhancement and deliveries as well as reviewing the escalation formulae(5). Industrial recovery measures have been identified and the Group is focused on delivery, but risk remains.

Reported EBIT*(3) rose slightly to € 4,086 million (2014: € 4,040 million), with net one-offs totalling € -46 million and comprising:

A net charge of € 635 million related to the dollar pre-delivery payment mismatch and balance sheet revaluation driven by the devaluation of the euro versus the dollar compared to historical rates;

A € 290 million net charge related to the A400M programme which is unchanged compared to the first half 2015 results disclosure;

A net gain of € 90 million linked to divestments in Defence and Space and of Commercial Aircraft subsidiary CIMPA;

A gain of € 41 million after reassessing and adjusting the provision for the restructuring at Defence and Space which is progressing well;

A € 748 million net gain from the sale of an 18.75% stake in Dassault Aviation(6) in the first half of 2015.

Net income(4)and earnings per share (EPS) increased 15 percent to € 2,696 million (2014: € 2,343 million) and € 3.43 (2014: € 2.99) respectively. The finance result was € -687 million (2014: € -778 million) and included one-offs totalling € -218 million, mainly from a negative foreign exchange revaluation. 2015 net income and EPS were positively influenced by a lower effective tax rate following tax reduced capital gains from divestments.

Based on the EPS performance, Airbus Group’s Board of Directors will propose to the Annual General Meeting the payment of a 2015 dividend of € 1.30 per share on 4 May 2016 (FY 2014: € 1.20 per share). The record date shall be 3 May 2016. “Given the solid financial and operational progress during 2015, we are proposing an improved dividend of € 1.30 a share, which represents an eight percent increase over 2014. This is in line with the top end of our stated dividend policy,” said Airbus Group Chief Financial Officer Harald Wilhelm.

Free cash flowbefore mergers and acquisitions improved to € 1,175 million (2014: € 1,109 million), reflecting the solid operational performance, healthy pre-delivery payment inflows and ongoing efforts to control working capital during the programme ramp-up phase. Proceeds of around € 1.7 billion in the first half of 2015 from the sale of Dassault Aviation shares boosted free cash flow to € 2,825 million (2014: € 2,002 million). The net cash position at the end of 2015 was € 10.0 billion (year-end 2014: € 9.1 billion) after a 2014 dividend payment of € 945 million (2013: € 587 million), € 264 million spent under the share buyback and a pension contribution of € 217 million. The gross cash position on 31 December 2015 was € 19.1 billion (year-end 2014: € 16.4 billion).

Outlook

As the basis for its 2016 guidance, Airbus Group expects the world economy and air traffic to grow in line with prevailing independent forecasts and assumes no major disruptions.

2016 earnings and free cash flow guidance is based on a constant perimeter.

In 2016, Airbus expects to deliver more than 650 aircraft, and the commercial order book is expected to grow.

In 2016, before M&A, Airbus Group expects stable EBIT* before one-off and EPS* before one-off compared to 2015.

In 2016, before M&A, Airbus Group expects to deliver stable free cash flow compared to 2015.

* Airbus Group uses EBIT pre-goodwill impairment and exceptionals as a key indicator of its economic performance. The term “exceptionals” refers to such items as depreciation expenses of fair value adjustments relating to the former EADS merger and Airbus Combination, as well as impairment charges thereon.

Airbus widebody and single-aisle jetliners continue to make their mark in the dynamic Asia-Pacific region - Airbus,"Mon, 15 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE2LTAyLWFpcmJ1cy13aWRlYm9keS1hbmQtc2luZ2xlLWFpc2xlLWpldGxpbmVycy1jb250aW51ZS10by1tYWtlLXRoZWlyLW1hcmstaW4tdGhl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This week’s Singapore Airshow is shining a spotlight on Airbus’ important commercial presence in the Asia-Pacific region – which is the fastest-growing market globally for new civil aircraft, as well as a key customer base for the company’s product line of modern widebody and single-aisle jetliners.





Airbus entered this market in 1974 with a milestone A300B order from Korean Air. Today, more than 2,800 company-produced aircraft are in service with 100-plus Asia-Pacific-based operators, while customers from the region account for approximately 31 per cent of all Airbus orders worldwide.





New-generation appeal





Airbus’ latest entrant to the Asia-Pacific market is the new-generation A350 XWB, which has been shaping the efficiency of medium-to-long haul airline operations worldwide since its service entry in January 2015. Vietnam Airlines became the second airline to operate the A350 XWB last year, and it currently has four of these modern jetliners in service.





Singapore Airlines is now preparing to receive its first of 67 A350 XWBs on order – which will form the backbone of this international carrier’s future mid-size widebody aircraft fleet, and are to be operated on long-range flights, as well as on selected regional services. The carrier’s order includes seven Ultra-Long Range versions of the aircraft, which will enable the airline to restart non-stop service between Singapore and New York in 2018.





Featuring an “Xtra wide” cabin, the A350 XWB is especially well-suited to the needs of Asia-Pacific airlines flying to Europe and North America. In addition to Vietnam Airlines and Singapore Airlines, carriers from the region that have already ordered the aircraft are: Asiana Airlines, AirAsia X, Cathay Pacific Airways, China Airlines, Hong Kong Airlines, Japan Airlines, Korean Air and Thai Airways International (THAI).





A widebody tradition





The A350 XWB isn’t the first Airbus widebody jetliner to make headlines in the region. The market has long been a driving force for development of the world’s largest passenger aircraft, the 21st century flagship A380 – which has now been ordered by seven Asia-Pacific-based carriers.





A total of 62 A380s have entered service in the region since beginning service with launch customer Singapore Airlines in October 2007. Also operating the double-deck jetliner are: Asiana Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Korean Air, Malaysia Airlines, Qantas Airways and THAI.





Airbus’ A330/A340 Family also has proven popular with Asia-Pacific customers, as 28 airlines in the region have ordered over 650 aircraft – representing a third of total firm orders for this product line.





Single-aisle success





In the single-aisle category, Airbus’ best-selling A320 Family has enjoyed a high level of success across the Asia-Pacific market – with 3,140 CEO (current engine option) and NEO (new engine option) aircraft ordered to date by full service and low-cost carriers, while leasing companies in the region have accounted for an additional 659 orders.





This commercial activity represents 31 per cent of all bookings for Airbus’ single-aisle product line, and is expanding upon the 2,000-plus A320 Family aircraft already in service with Asia-Pacific operators.





Major full service carriers that operate the jetliners include Air China, Air India, Air New Zealand, All Nippon Airways, Asiana Airlines, China Eastern, China Southern, Dragonair, Philippine Airlines and Vietnam Airlines. In the low cost sector, the A320 Family is the aircraft of choice for all the major operators in the region, including AirAsia, Cebu Pacific, Indigo, JetStar, Lion Air, Tigerair and VietJetAir.





An eye to the future





Already a major market for commercial aircraft, Asia-Pacific’s demand will continue to grow in the coming decades according to Airbus’ latest Global Market Forecast – which covers the 2015-2034 timeframe.





Airlines in the Asia-Pacific region will take delivery of around 12,600 new aircraft over the next 20 years, according to the latest market forecast by Airbus. These deliveries will account for 40 per cent of all new aircraft with more than 100 seats entering service worldwide over the forecast period, with the region growing at a rate higher than the global average."
Airbus Seeks Patent For Seat To Fit Wider Passengers - CBS Miami,"Thu, 25 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL21pYW1pL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLXNlZWtzLXBhdGVudC1mb3Itc2VhdC10by1maXQtd2lkZXItcGFzc2VuZ2Vycy_SAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvbWlhbWkvbmV3cy9haXJidXMtc2Vla3MtcGF0ZW50LWZvci1zZWF0LXRvLWZpdC13aWRlci1wYXNzZW5nZXJzLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Follow CBSMIAMI.COM: Facebook | Twitter

WASHINGTON, D.C. (CBSMiami) – A new take on the airline seat could make it possible for airlines to charge based on a person's size.

Jetmaker Airbus wants to patent a seating concept taking a row of three airline seats and turning it into a ""rapidly and easily re-configurable"" bench.

It could seat the traditional three passengers, shift to two people who need additional space – including ""overweight passengers"" – or even fit a 4th person, like a two parents and two small children.

""The airlines will consider anything that allows them to make a buck,"" said Ben Mutzabaugh, editor of USA Today's ""Today in the Sky"" blog.

""If we've seen nothing else in the airline industry, they're very clever with coming up with ways to sell seats to passengers, especially when they can charge more for either seats that are better or for seats that are less awful.""

Airbus previously sought patents for a design stacking passengers, a semi-standing concept.

Zodiac Seats US created a hexagon pattern where the middle seat faces the passengers in the aisle and window, while adding up to 30 more passengers per plane.

But Tennessee Rep. Steve Cohen worries extra seats could jeopardize safety, making it hard to evacuate within the required 90 seconds.

He's authored a bill requiring the Federal Aviation Administration to set minimum seat-size standards.

""If people can't get out of an airplane in an emergency condition, they lose their lives,"" he said. ""It shouldn't be after there's an accident, after there's an accident it's too late, and people are dead.""

It still remains to be seen whether an airline expresses interest in the idea and whether safety regulators will even allow it in a commercial plane.

Patent filings are a bit like concept cars at an auto show. Airbus said it applies for hundreds of patents a year and the vast majority never become fully realized technology or products."

Airbus Helicopters ready to sign letters of intent for the H160 Development

Louisville, Kentucky, After its worldwide debut at Heli-Expo in 2015, Airbus Helicopters is now launching the commercialisation of the H160 with letters of intent available for potential customers.“The public response to the H160 has been fantastic and we have started discussions with customers for different mission configurations for the H160” explained Guillaume Faury, President and CEO of Airbus Helicopters. “Development is now moving forward with two prototypes flying and a third one being built, meaning that we will soon be able to confirm the aircraft’s performance details that are essential to our customers,” he added.Carrying out twenty percent more flight hours per month than previous developments at the same stage thanks to the System Helicopter 0 & Dynamic Helicopter 0 ground test facilities, the first prototype (PT1) has logged around 100 hours. The second prototype (PT2), that took off on 27 January, has started performance flight tests with Turbomeca’s Arrano engine. The third prototype (PT3) will join its fellow aircraft in 2017 and will essentially be employed to develop the different mission configurations, testing cabin interiors and optionals that will be available to customers.At this year’s Heli-Expo, Airbus Helicopters is showing the H160 in a digital format, highlighting its inherent multi-role capacities. A dedicated virtual reality corner will allow future customers to visualize the H160 in different seating configurations for oil and gas missions, public services operations (such as medevac and law enforcement) and emergency medical services.The H160 will pioneer a brand new industrial model, improving competitiveness and customer satisfaction with the final assembly being performed in 18 weeks instead of 36 for the previous generation. Having partnered with Latécoère Services for a state of the art integrated final assembly line for which the first station will be implemented at the end of 2016, the H160 is gearing up to its serial production. This automated moving flow line will be comprised of two production lines, each equipped with several workstations capable of assembling the different H160 configurations.Airbus Helicopters associated key operators to the EASA-led MSG-3 process so that all inspection or maintenance requirements have been questioned, all intervals have been challenged, and the resulting maintenance schedule will significantly reduce the maintenance burden and improves aircraft availability. The H160 will be as simple to maintain as a light twin helicopter.The H160 support and services strategy relies on the digital continuity development process implemented from the beginning of the program. Digital servicing enables a seamless management of operators’ evolving business whether it is airworthiness, maintenance, material management, or training. The H160 will implement a paperless multi-support philosophy, enabling a quick and accurate information exchange and allowing our customers to make decisions faster. With the recent signature of the full-flight simulator partnership with Thales and Helisim, Airbus Helicopters also wants to ensure best in class safety from entry into service for its future customers.Airbus Helicopters, a division of Airbus Group, provides the most efficient civil and military helicopter solutions worldwide. Its in-service fleet includes nearly 12,000 helicopters operated by more than 3,000 customers in 154 countries. Airbus Helicopters employs more than 22,000 people worldwide and in 2015 generated revenues of 6.8 billion Euros."
Spain: the Airbus 8 acquitted | IndustriALL - IndustriALL Global Union,"Thu, 18 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZHVzdHJpYWxsLXVuaW9uLm9yZy9zcGFpbi1qdWRnZS1hY3F1aXRzLXRoZS1haXJidXMtONIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The eight trade unionists, members of IndustriALL Global Union affiliates, CC.OO de Industria and MCA-UGT, were charged after joining hundreds of workers in a general strike in September 2010, against austerity measures and changes to the Spanish labour code.

The eight men have consistently denied the charges of ‘acting with violence’ and ‘attacking the right to work’, and after the trial concluded on 12 February the Court acquitted the Airbus 8.



“Today is a great day for democracy,” said José Alcazar, president of the Airbus works council and one of the trade unionists charged. “This is important not only for the eight but for the whole labour movement in our country.”



The eight workers, Tomás García, Enrique Gil, Rodolfo Malo, José Alcazar, Raúl Fernández, Armando Barco, Jerónimo Martín and Edgar Martín, had been charged under Article 315.3 of the Spanish Penal Code, which allows for prison sentences for picketing trade unionists.



The law dates back to the Franco regime and has been labeled an attack on trade unions and the right to strike by the union movement.



Trade unions in Spain have protested vehemently against the charges, supported by the international labour movement. On 9 February, thousands of people including representatives of IndustriALL Global Union and industriAll Europe marched on the streets of Madrid to protest against the trial.



“This is a victory for the Spanish unions and for the workers who were exercising their fundamental rights,” says Jyrki Raina, IndustriALL Global Union general secretary. “But we continue to support our affiliates in their demands to drop charges in other similar cases and to repeal Article 315.3, which criminalizes the right to strike.”"
"Airbus Raises Plane Production, Boosted by Low Oil Prices and Iran - Fortune","Wed, 24 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAxNi8wMi8yNC9haXJidXMtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1pcmFuLW9pbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Group performed a partial U-turn on plans to cut production of its profitable A330 aircraft on Wednesday, easing the delicate transition to a newer model as it posted 2015 profits in line with expectations on Wednesday.

The European planemaker said it now planned to build seven A330 wide-body jets per month from 2017, partially unwinding recent staggered cuts in output to six from 10 a month as it prepares for its new A350 jetliner.

The move to undo part of the decline of one of its two main sources of cash and profits came weeks after Iran agreed to buy 45 A330 jets as part of a $27 billion deal following the lifting of sanctions.

It contrasted with market disappointment just over a year ago when it announced plans to cut output of the 250-300 seater.

Airbus also confirmed that it had a rare new customer for its struggling A380 superjumbo jet. Japan’s All Nippon Airways has agreed to buy three of the passenger jets, the world’s largest, which sell for almost $500 million each.

Demand for the current generation of jetliners is declining as new models enter the market. But it has gained a temporary respite from the collapse in oil prices, which have made some airlines pause investment in newer, more efficient models.

The upward revision in production of the current A330 model, known as A330ceo, could boost earnings in 2017 and bodes well for output of the current 777 model at rival Boeing (BA), which has also just entered negotiations with Iran, analysts said.

“Given each A330ceo makes roughly €20 million in profit, this would represent about 5% more (in earnings before interest and tax),” RBC Capital Markets analyst Rob Stallard said in a note.

After several years of ballooning orders, many industry analysts have expressed concerns about the aerospace cycle due to a recent dip in overall demand and concerns over the economy.

Airbus reiterated a cautious outlook for 2015, underlining what many analysts see as a tricky, transitional year between old and new models at the two leading planemakers.

Shares in Europe’s largest aerospace group were flat in early trading, slightly outperforming the broader market.

Airbus (EADSY) said output plans for the A350 remained challenging, and confirmed delays to its newly revamped A320neo jet, whose deliveries are to be weighted towards the second half of this year following issues with Pratt & Whitney engines.

It also signaled lingering risk with its A400M military transport plane as it negotiates with European nations over recent delays and shortfalls in capability.

Airbus Group said 2015 operating earnings before one-off items rose 2% to €4.13 billion as revenue gained 6% to 64.45 billion. Analysts on average predicted core profit of 4.11 billion on sales of 64.74 billion.

Airbus Group said it expected stable underlying operating profit and cash flow this year. For 2015, it posted stronger-than-expected free cash flow of €2.8 billion, boosted by the sale of a stake in Dassault Aviation, and hiked its dividend by 8% to €1.30 per share."

Emirates' other U.S. destinations that currently have either full-year or seasonal service on A380 aircraft are New York JFK, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Dallas/Fort Worth. Emirates also flies the A380 to Houston Bush Intercontinental, though the carrier's schedules show a switch to 777 service for flights after June.

Gurney declined to specifically say whether Emirates might boost its A380 presence in the United States, saying only that “we’re constantly looking at those opportunities.”

When pressed, Gurney noted the number of A380s still scheduled to be delivered to Emirates, suggesting some of those newly delivered planes could end up flying on North American routes.

“We’re just over halfway through that delivery program,” Gurney says about the carrier’s existing order for A380s. “There’s more aircraft to come. I’m sure we’ll see some of this aircraft being flown into the U.S.”

Emirates' A380 is perhaps best known for its swanky first-class cabin, where the luxurious lie-flat seats also come with access to an in-flight shower. Emirates has recently launched a publicity campaign for its high-end seats, including ads with actress Jennifer Aniston that are now airing in select U.S. markets.

“The A380 is a great product,” Gurney says. “It is a customer magnet. People are attracted to that product.”

But tickets for the cabin don’t come cheap. Fares for a May round-trip between Washington and Dubai started at a cool $23,549 according to a Feb. 24 search of Emirates’ website. Fares in Emirates' first-class cabin were a bit cheaper for the airline’s flights between New York JFK and Milan, starting at $7,281 for the same dates.

Whether you’ve got the cash or not, you can check out Emirates’ first-class cabin – as well as its business- and coach-class cabins – in the above photo gallery that we put together from our Feb. 23 tour of the jet. Or check out the gallery below from when Emirates showed off its A380 last year during a similar show-and-tell in Orlando. Enjoy!

"Airbus files patent to put more storage under seats (but goodbye, legroom!) - USA TODAY","Wed, 17 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90cmF2ZWwvcm9hZHdhcnJpb3J2b2ljZXMvMjAxNi8wMi8xNy9haXJidXMtc2VhdC1zdG9yYWdlLXBhdGVudC84MDUwOTIwMi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus files patent to put more storage under seats (but goodbye, legroom!)

So do you want the good news or the bad news first? The good? OK, Airbus has filed a patent for an under-seat storage compartment, which would make it easier to contain your smallest carry-on items (and keep you from crawling through the aisles after one tube of lipstick goes rogue and rolls out of your bag). But here’s the bad news: putting a solid box under each seat would further restrict already limited leg room, preventing you from stretching your legs under the seat in front of you.

The other potential downside to this design is that, in order to access the items in the storage box, each passenger would have to unbuckle their seatbelt, stand up and lift the seat cushion. That sounds less convenient than the current situation, especially when everyone is attempting to pull their laptops out shortly after takeoff or trying to stash them before landing. And if these storage bins were placed under the seats, where would the life vests go?

Airbus hasn’t said that this patent is exclusively for aircraft; in its filing, it suggested that these storage areas could be used on buses or trains, as well. Airbus: Bringing the inconvenience of air travel to other forms of transportation!

The Daily Mail quotes Airbus as explaining:

“In means of transportation, in particular in a cabin of an aircraft, stowage and/or storage space is usually rather restricted and scarce. Thus, an efficient and optimum use of the available stowage space may be regarded important from an economic point of view.”

Oh, from an economic point of view. That makes us think that the airlines could implement these small, awkward boxes and then start charging everyone for the difficulty of using them. For everyone’s sake, Airbus might want to go back to the drawing board."

"Asia-Pacific is a key A380 market today, and for the future - Airbus","Wed, 17 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE2LTAyLWFzaWEtcGFjaWZpYy1pcy1hLWtleS1hMzgwLW1hcmtldC10b2RheS1hbmQtZm9yLXRoZS1mdXR1cmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Asia-Pacific is a major market for the A380: half of the global customer base for Airbus’ 21st century flagship jetliner is located there, while all of the other world’s operators utilise A380s on routes to destinations in the area

The A380 has literally changed the shape of air transportation in Asia-Pacific, and will continue to play an important role as this region’s dynamic passenger traffic develops during the years to come.Asia-Pacific is a major “home” for the A380: almost half of the global customer base for Airbus’ 21st century flagship jetliner is located there, while all of the other world’s operators utilise A380s on routes to destinations in the area.Singapore Airlines introduced the first A380 commercial service in 2007, and is now flying an expanding fleet of the airliners from its base at Changi Airport – located next to the Changi Exhibition Centre, where this week’s Singapore Airshow is being held.The other Asia-Pacific A380 operators are South Korea’s Asiana Airlines, China Southern, Korean Air, Malaysia Airlines, Qantas Airways in Australia and Thai Airways International (THAI). The list of Asian customers will expand following the recent announcement of an order for the aircraft by Japan’s All Nippon Airways (ANA).“While airline passenger traffic doubles worldwide every 15 years, such a doubling occurs each 10 years in Asia – so A380’s market importance will continue as airlines respond to the growing demand,” explained David Dufrenois, head of Airbus’ A380 Market Development Platform.Routes flown by A380 have clearly demonstrated the jetliner’s capability to meet a full range of operational needs. In addition to connecting the world’s major airport hubs on long-range flights, the A380 is increasingly used for more regional routes, such as between Singapore and Hong Kong; Singapore and New Delhi; Singapore and Mumbai; Singapore and Tokyo; Seoul to Hong Kong; and Seoul to Bangkok.Another example of the A380’s adaptability is Malaysia Airlines’ deployment of the aircraft for Hajj pilgrimage trips to Saudi Arabia – a type of operation that could open wider opportunities for the A380 in the future, according to Dufrenois.The “A380 effect” also has been seen in markets where one carrier’s presence lead to other services in a region. This occurred after the 2014 approval of A380 flights to India, where Singapore Airlines began routes into the country, followed by Emirates, Etihad and Lufthansa opening their own A380 service to Indian destinations. “Similarly, we expect to see more and more A380 flights for China, both into the country and within its borders, driven by air traffic growth,” he added.Passengers continue to show their preference for the A380, often paying a premium when they can choose from aircraft types on a specific route, Dufrenois said. He also noted that the jetliner is becoming an even greater enabler for airlines with today’s lower fuel costs.Airbus has delivered some 180 A380s to 13 airlines so far, with these aircraft carrying a combined total of approximately 120 million passengers to date. An A380 takes off or lands somewhere in the world every three minutes.The number of A380-compatible airports today now stands at 120 globally, including major destinations throughout Asia-Pacific – ensuring this jetliner’s distinctive shape will be an increasingly familiar sight in the region."
Airbus Zephyr: The eternal high-altitude surveillance sun-drone - Ars Technica,"Thu, 18 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vYXJzdGVjaG5pY2EuY29tL2luZm9ybWF0aW9uLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kvMjAxNi8wMi90aGUtYW1hemluZy1ldGVybmFsLXN1bi1kcm9uZS13aWxsLXRoZS16ZXBoeXItc2hpbmUtb3ItYnVybi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In the near future, we are told, the UK's Ministry of Defence is set to shell out £10.6 million to buy a truly unusual drone. The Zephyr, for that is the name of this mythical winged beast, has been described by its creator as an “eternal” aircraft. It has the “endurance of a satellite,"" according to its manufacturer, being able to stay airborne for astonishingly long periods—but it could be better than a satellite, and potentially costs a lot less too.

How can this be?

Well, like most satellites, the Zephyr is solar powered. But it’s not a spacecraft: it’s an aeroplane, which uses electric motors to turn its propellers. During the day, sunlight on its solar-panel wings provides energy not only for the motors, but to charge up the banks of lithium-sulphate batteries which keep the Zephyr powered through the night. Zephyr already holds the world records for longest un-refuelled flight by any aeroplane and longest flight by an unmanned air system, which it set with a 14-day sortie in 2010.

It's a pseudo satellite, sir

According to Airbus Defence and Space, the European arms’n’aerospace mammoth which owns the Zephyr, the robot sun-plane “delivers a truly unique real-time satellite like capability."" The company, indeed, prefers to call Zephyr a “pseudo satellite” rather than an unmanned air system.

Jonathan Dixon, head of engineering at the Zephyr project team, goes further. An Earth satellite, by its nature, operates at an altitude of at least 100 miles, whereas the Zephyr is intended to fly about 12 miles (65,000 feet) above Earth, and can naturally see things in more detail. A satellite in low orbit is also compelled to circle the Earth rapidly, meaning that it zooms briefly across the sky at long intervals, whereas the Zephyr can keep circling above a point on the surface for as long as its operators want.

“It’s truly disruptive,” enthuses Dixon. Apart from surveillance, he says the Zephyr is excellent for the purpose of communications relay. During trial flights it has been able to provide line-of-sight hookups between ground transceivers 400 kilometres apart. “It worked—straightforwardly,” Dixon tells Ars.

Achieving all this isn’t simple. In order to generate a significant amount of solar power, the Zephyr has to be huge: the latest version has a wingspan of 25 metres (82 feet)—as broad as a small airliner. But this enormous aircraft weighs just 60 kilograms (132 pounds), half of which is batteries, so the structure—despite being made of super-strong carbon fibre—is very fragile. If one were to pick up a Zephyr at its midpoint or wingtips, it would break into pieces. Instead, it is launched by a team of people stationed along the length of its huge wings, who pick it up together and run forward very carefully to bring the delicate machine to takeoff speed.

Even once it’s in the air, the Zephyr’s limited power means that it can’t go very fast: maximum speed is just 9.5 metres per second, or about 20mph, and it generally goes slower than that to preserve battery charge.

This is why a Zephyr has to fly so high: its fragile structure can only survive in the lower atmosphere when the air is unusually calm, and it is so slow that it would likely be carried off who-knows-where by the wind if it spent any large amount of time below the so-called “wind bucket” found above 60,000 feet, where wind speeds are much slower than they are at lower altitudes.

“As Zephyr is so light, it is very susceptible to gusts which could knock it off course or cause the aircraft to break,” writes Annabel Rapinett, who worked with the Zephyr team as a grad student, and whose dissertation is viewable online (PDF).

“In order to overcome these winds, launch has to take place in perfect weather conditions in order to minimise risk of wind. This is one of the reasons the previous flight trials have occurred in the deserts of Australia and the USA as the desert provides still air and minimum turbulence.”

Once you successfully get it up to 60,000 feet, though...

You have to say that an aircraft which can only be launched on a freakishly calm day from the middle of a desert might not be quite the military’s cup of tea. But hold on—this is an “eternal plane,"" remember. The idea would be to have Zephyrs up there in the wind bucket at all times, ready to head off and spy on someone or set up a communications relay station wherever might be required. Airbus points out that Zephyrs fitted with satellite communications “can be controlled across the world from a central control station.""

In theory, then, you could have a group of “eternal” Zephyrs lurking at the ready above the UK and send them off around the world when a spying or comms-relay job came up. At 20mph they could be above the Arabian Gulf, for instance, seven days after getting the word to go. In reality this would probably take a good bit longer, but on the other hand there would be no need to keep your Zephyrs above the UK. They could be parked above international waters anywhere you liked without permission from anyone.

Actually, though, not quite anywhere: certainly not above the UK. And, in rather a lot of places, not for large parts of the year either.

“As Zephyr is powered by solar energy it is essential that it is flown when there is enough solar power,” Rapinett tells us. “In the northern hemisphere this is during the three months surrounding the summer solstice (May, June and July).”

Another reason that all the Zephyr’s flight trials so far have taken place in hot deserts is that it needs to be near the Equator so that the Sun will pass high overhead. Unlike ground based solar panels, the Zephyr’s wings cannot be kept tilted towards the Sun, and even ground panels lose a lot of power when the sunlight must travel a long way through the atmosphere at a shallow angle rather than coming straight down.

Funnily enough, the Zephyr’s record-breaking two week flight in 2010 took place in Arizona, just nine degrees of latitude from the Tropic of Cancer, at northern midsummer—the best time and position on the planet for solar power."

Airbus Patents Bench Seats for Fat Flyers - Popular Mechanics,"Mon, 22 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHVsYXJtZWNoYW5pY3MuY29tL2ZsaWdodC9uZXdzL2ExOTU0Ni9haXJidXMtcGF0ZW50LWJlbmNoLXNlYXRzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"US Patent Office

When news of a new patent for airline seating surfaces, the news is often dreadful. Think of the creative and bizarre solutions we've seen for cramming ever more passengers onto a plane. But this one from Airbus isn't so cringe-inducing. It might actually be smart.

A recent patent filing by the aviation giant imagines airliner seating not as the individual bucket seating we're so accustomed to, but as a bench that's more flexible for people of differing sizes. As the patent's pencil drawings illustrate, a bench could accommodate two rather hefty fellows, three people of average size, or a family of four with the two kids sitting inside mom and dad.

US Patent Office

This is just a patent, of course, and so like many of them it's a rough idea that may never see the light of day. So we're left to wonder how booking and pricing would work for a bench rather than individual seats. Kudos to Airbus, though, for at least imagining a slightly less dystopian future of flying.

Airbus recently filed a separate patent for under-seat storage. In this scenario, you would store your personal item not under the seat in front of you, but rather under your own seat by lifting up the seat cushion. Sounds like a reasonable idea at first, until you consider that this design would probably reduce legroom even further—and require you to stand up if you suddenly need to get something out of your bag.

Lufthansa, Airbus and Pratt & Whitney holding a delivery ceremony in Hamburg – First scheduled A320neo flights with better fuel efficiency and more passenger comfort achieved through quieter engines - 40 years of partnership between Lufthansa and Airbus

Lufthansa takes delivery of the world's first Airbus A320neo as launching customer. Robert Leduc, President of Pratt & Whitney, Carsten Spohr, Chairman of the Board and CEO of the Lufthansa Group, Airbus President and CEO Fabrice Brégier

Lufthansa, together with Airbus and the Pratt & Whitney engine manufacturer, celebrates the delivery of the world’s first Airbus A320neo. Carsten Spohr, Chairman of the Board and CEO of the Lufthansa Group, Airbus President and CEO Fabrice Brégier and the President of Pratt & Whitney Robert Leduc invited 700 guests and media representatives to the official delivery at Hamburg-Finkenwerder. Following the ceremonial handover, the first two new-type airplanes were presented to the public. The first A320neo, with the registration D-AINA, has already flown scheduled service since January. The second “neo” is expected to complement the Lufthansa Airbus fleet soon. The first experiences with the A320neo clearly show that the 15 percent lower fuel consumption mark has not only been achieved but even slightly exceeded. The significantly quieter engines also increase customer comfort on-board and provide relief to residents near airports by reducing noise emissions.The development and introduction of the quietest and most fuel-efficient aircraft on short and medium distances is further evidence of the successful cooperation in the aviation industry at European level. “Europe has been a leader in this fascinating industry since the early days of aviation,” says Carsten Spohr. “Lufthansa and Airbus have developed a trusting and productive 40-year partnership. Together we have pushed ahead and brought to market many innovations and contributed to the success of the European aerospace industry. With new and efficient aircraft, such as the A320neo and the A350 XWB, we set new standards for our passengers, while reducing the impact on the environment and, not least of all, on the people living near airports.”“On behalf of everyone at Airbus, I congratulate Lufthansa on being the A320neo launch customer. Together, we’re opening a new chapter in commercial aviation and I am confident that the A320neo will support Lufthansa objective to raise its environmental performance. The A320neo not only cuts emissions at every operational stage but also halves its noise footprint compared to previous generation aircraft,” said Fabrice Brégier, Airbus President and CEO.“At Airbus we are have been proud to support Lufthansa’s growth over the past four decades with our partnership now spanning almost the entire Airbus family, from the A320 right up to the A380.”""Pratt & Whitney is proud to build on its long and deep history with Lufthansa and Airbus by together marking a new era in commercial aviation with the delivery of the A320neo equipped with ultra-high bypass ratio Geared Turbofan engines,"" Pratt & Whitney President Robert Leduc, said. “We applaud Lufthansa for being the first to enjoy the many benefits this aircraft and engine technology affords in terms of fuel efficiency and in reducing noise and emissions.”This afternoon, the A320neo will take off from the Airbus facilities in Hamburg-Finkenwerder as a special flight with flight number LH9917 with guests and media representatives on board and fly with a short stop in Hamburg’s City Airport Fuhlsbüttel towards Frankfurt. The A320neo was fitted with a special logo. “First to fly A320neo - Less noise. Less fuel. Less CO2“ adorns the rear fuselage of the Lufthansa aircraft.Another cause for celebration is the 40-year partnership between Lufthansa and Airbus. On 9 February 1976, Lufthansa received the first Airbus A300 at Hamburg-Finkenwerder. The airlines within the Lufthansa Group have ordered a total of 582 Airbus aircraft in the past 40 years. Lufthansa is the largest Airbus customer with currently 392 aircraft from the European manufacturer, including 284 aircraft from the A320 family and 14 A380.The Lufthansa Group has ordered a total of 116 A320neos and A321neos, to be delivered in the next years. 60 aircraft will be delivered with the new PW1100G-JM engine from Pratt & Whitney. A special intermediary 3:1 gear conversion system ensures optimum speed of the 2.06 meter-cross-section fans and the turbine inside the engine. The new engines and improved aerodynamics allow a significant noise and emission reduction. With the new engine technology, the 85-decibel noise footprint of a new A320neo is only about half the size as a comparable aircraft of the existing fleet. In addition, the A320neo is at least 15 percent more fuel efficient than the previous A320 version. Calculated per-seat, this efficiency advantage increases to as much as around 20 percent, because the A320neo, through improved use of space in the cabin, allows more space in the business class compartment and two more rows with twelve additional seats on board."
This New Airbus Glider Is Set to Become The Highest-Flying Winged Vehicle Ever - ScienceAlert,"Fri, 05 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VhbGVydC5jb20vdGhpcy1uZXctYWlyYnVzLWdsaWRlci1pcy1zZXQtdG8taGl0LXRoZS1zdHJhdG9zcGhlcmUtYXMtdGhlLWhpZ2hlc3QtZmx5aW5nLXdpbmdlZC12ZWhpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is getting ready to test the capacity of its engineless Perlan 2 glider, and it's expected to reach an altitude of 27 km (90,000 feet) - well beyond the lower edge of Earth's stratosphere. If it succeeds, this will be the highest any winged vehicle, powered or otherwise, has achieved sustained, level flight.

While that would be a pretty awesome achievement in itself, if Airbus sets this record, it could have really exciting implications for the future of aviation not only on Earth, but also out on Mars. ""Airbus recently filed a patent for hypersonic passenger craft that will go to suborbital space and back down again,"" Allan McArtor, chairman and CEO of Airbus, told Forbes. ""It's in that region of suborbital space that Perlan 2 will be flying.""

Back in 2012, pilots Steve Fossett and Einar Enevoldson crushed the existing altitude record for gliders by hitting an altitude of 15.4 km (50,671 feet) in Airbus's Perlan 1 glider. This aircraft has since entered retirement in the Seattle Museum of Flight, but we're about to see the difference four years of development can make.

While Fossett and Enevoldson (a former NASA test pilot who founded the Perlan Project) had to borrow special inflated pressure suits from NASA to survive such a thin atmosphere, the Perlan 2 crew will be in the (relative) lap of luxury inside its pressurised cabin, complete with oxygen re-breather systems.

So how does it hit such heights without an engine? Since the 1930s, pilots have been experimenting with mountain waves - strong oscillations caused by winds travelling at speeds of at least 27 km/h (15 knots) as they blow across the tops of mountains. For decades, glider pilots knew if they rode in the waves, rather than on top of them like a surfer, they could use the upward-moving part to hit much higher altitudes.

But there was a limit to how high they could get - or so they thought. Because of the interaction between cold air and warm air at the troposphere and the stratosphere, it was assumed that these mountain waves could only carry you to this point, so an altitude of about 9 km ( 30,000 ft) at the poles to 17 km (56,000 ft) at the Equator.

Then Enevoldson came along and changed everything. As Gary Robbins writes for the San Diego Union-Tribune:

""Einar Enevoldson was strolling past a scientist's office in 1991 when he noticed a freshly printed image tacked to the wall. He was thunderstruck; it showed faint particles in the sky that proved something he had long believed - the winds that rise off mountains travel far, far higher into the atmosphere than most people imagined, representing something of an 'elevator' to the heavens.""

As a man of science, Enevoldson probably wouldn't have put it like that, but he spent the next seven years gathering evidence of mountain waves existence well into the stratosphere.

In 1998, meteorologist Elizabeth Austin started collaborating with Enevoldson, and discovered what would come to be known as the Polar Vortex - a stratospheric polar night jet that only occurs in winter when the air is super cold and travelling at speeds of around 480 km/h (260 knots) form incredibly high mountain waves. It's on these particular waves that the Perlan Project has been built.

The mission to get higher than any other winged vehicle ever has before is not just to test the limits of current aviation technology - Airbus says by getting an engineless glider up there, it will allow scientists to study the unique atmospheric conditions of the stratosphere's middle, without polluting everything in the process with fuel emissions.

Accordingly, the plane will be fitted with several scientific instruments for taking various atmospheric measures. ""The knowledge gained from this project will impact how the world understands and addresses climate change,"" Airbus Group CEO, Tom Enders, said last year. ""But it will also help Airbus continue to innovate ways to fly higher, faster and cleaner, on Earth and possibly beyond.""

As Bruce Dorminey explains at Forbes, the more we know about the atmospheric conditions of the stratosphere, the better informed we'll be about what pilots stationed out on Mars will one day have to deal with:

""With Mars's thin atmosphere, McArtor says flight using a propeller or a standard turbine jet engine would be very difficult. Instead, he says that a Mars aircraft would need to be a hybrid that used some means of thrust and soar dynamics to move above the red planet's surface.""

The Perlan 2 test flight is scheduled for June, and the glider will take-off from a base in Argentina, propelled a few thousand metres up using a tow plane and cable, and then catching mountain waves all the way up. By 2019, they hope to hit an altitude of 30 km (100,000 feet) using special transonic wings. It's going to be one hell of a flight."
"Airbus, Boeing deals slump - DW (English)","Wed, 17 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR3LmNvbS9lbi9haXJidXMtYm9laW5nLXNlZS1kZWFscy1zbHVtcC1hdC1zaW5nYXBvcmUtYWlyc2hvdy9hLTE5MDUzNDU00gFTaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuZHcuY29tL2VuL2FpcmJ1cy1ib2Vpbmctc2VlLWRlYWxzLXNsdW1wLWF0LXNpbmdhcG9yZS1haXJzaG93L2EtMTkwNTM0NTQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The world's two biggest planemakers have announced only modest orders at the Asian aviation trade fair - a sign of slowing demand after the 2014 show hauled in more than $30 billion (26 billion euros) of deals.

On the sidelines of the Singapore Airshow, European planemaker Airbus on Wednesday announced an order for six A350-900 planes, valued at $1.8 billion at list prices from Philippine Airlines (PAL). Its biggest rival, Boeing, said it had landed a deal for 12 of its 737 jets with a privately-owned Chinese carrier, Okay Airways, valued at $1.3 billion.

PAL president Jaime Bautista said the planes would be used for non-stop, long-haul flights from the Philippines to the United States, Canada and Europe, and would support the airline's goal of becoming ""a full service five-star airline in five years.""

Fleet modernization was also the goal of China's low-cost carrier Okay Airways, said the airline's president Wang Shusheng, adding that his company's order was not part of a deal Boeing signed with China last year for 300 aircraft worth $38 billion.

Slowing demand

Boeing and Airbus made their announcements on the second day of the Singapore Airshow, which brings together more than 1,000 aerospace companies. The previous show in 2014 generated deals worth $32 billion.

Ahead of the event, Tony Tyler, director-general of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), said, however, that airlines in the region may try to push back their orders this year, due to softer profits.

Airline savings from low fuel costs were being eroded by hedging losses and a strong US dollar, Tyler said, noting that the greenback climbed 20 percent over the past 18 months.

Other industry experts also said they expected a significant downturn in orders, citing the recent slump in global oil prices.

""One of the reasons why the order books are full is because the fuel price was high, so there was an incentive to buy the more fuel-efficient planes and get rid of the old ones,"" said David Stewart, an aviation and aerospace adviser at ICF International. ""But now the fuel price is low, so some airlines will keep their older planes longer, and therefore not need the new [ones]. It's a quiet time for all of us,"" he told the news agency AP.

Airlines might also be deterred by the filled order books of both Airbus and Boeing that could mean a long wait for the delivery of airplanes, Stewart added.

Airbus chief executive Fabrice Bregier, however, brushed off fears of a downturn in the industry at a press conference Tuesday. He said his company forecast demand for 12,810 new airplanes in the Asia-Pacific area, valued at $2 trillion over the next 20 years. That would represent 40 percent of predicted global demand for about 32,600 airplanes over the same period.

Airbus expects passenger numbers in Asia to rise by 5.6 percent annually, with China forecast to post double-digit growth.

Boeing also said that it had no deferrals of orders in Asia, with demand in southeast Asia estimated at 3,750 airplanes, valued $550 billion, over the next two decades.

In other Singapore deals, a US leasing firm ordered 20 aircraft from Japan's Mitsubishi Aircraft in a transaction potentially worth more than $900 million.

Europe's largest aerospace group said operating earnings before one-off items, a measure of underlying performance, rose 2 percent to 4.132 billion euros ($4.55 billion) as revenue gained 6 percent to 64.450 billion.

Analysts were on average predicting full-year core operating income of 4.114 billion euros on revenue of 64.736 billion, according to a Reuters poll.

Airbus said it would produce seven A330 aircraft a month from 2017. A year ago, it announced plans to cut output of the wide-body jet to six a month from the first quarter of 2016, compared with its plan at the time to produce nine a month.

Airline execs confident despite slow going at Singapore Airshow - CNN,"Fri, 19 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvc2luZ2Fwb3JlLWFpcnNob3ctMjAxNi13cmFwLXVwL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Singapore CNN —

Order books may have been slower to open, but optimism has reigned at the Singapore Airshow this week given the bright prospects for aviation growth in the region.

More than 650 delegates from around the world made their way to Asia’s largest air show for four intense opening days of showcasing their products to the world.

This year, the Changi Exhibition Center boasts the largest display of static aircraft since its first edition, with over 60 commercial, private, military and experimental aircraft.

The biannual show is being held February 16-21, just five months ahead of the Farnborough Airshow in London – the world’s second largest – which marks its 50th show in July.

Executives worried? Naaaah

Orders and agreements are never as big in Singapore as in London or Paris (Le Bourget), but the economic significance of this show is paramount for the Asia-Pacific commercial aviation and defense industry.

In 2014, more than $32 billion in orders and agreements were signed in Singapore (a 3% increase over 2012), but expectations for this year’s show remained low as rumors of an upcoming aerospace downturn have been floating in the air.

Your own tour inside slick new business jets

“Some people are saying we’re in the middle of a bubble,” Airbus COO John Leahy said at a press conference. “But reality is, the only thing that worries me is to not be able to deliver the aircraft our customers have ordered.”

In fact, both Airbus and Boeing have strong backlogs and even though sales have been weak during the past year, optimism remains high at both manufacturing houses as the number of airplanes they have to deliver is, in Leahy’s words, large.

Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg agreed that worries of an upcoming crisis are unfounded.

He said aircraft demand will increase at a much faster pace than economic growth, as income and urbanization will continue to rise in Asia.

Embraer’s CCO John Slattery concurred, saying demand for new regional jets in the Asia-Pacific region will escalate to 6,350 new aircraft by 2020.

Asia to be aviation epicenter of the world … just not yet

Most of this growth will be powered by China, where urbanization and middle-class growth will require an enhanced aviation infrastructure.

“By 2025, there will be 200 mega-cities in China,” said Andreas Meisel, COO of the Ameco Beijing maintenance/repair (MRO) center, at the Asia Business Forum on the show’s second day.

“Each of these cities will need to be connected by air and rail, and this needs to be properly forecasted by both airplane manufacturers and the Chinese government.”

Asia is, in fact, becoming the aviation epicenter of the world.

Both mainline and low-cost carriers (LCC) are introducing new routes and demand continues to rise.

Aircraft manufacturers and MROs are heavily investing in the region.

Airbus has an A320 final assembly line in Tianjin, China, while Boeing produces key parts for its several programs at different locations throughout Asia, and expects to build a 737 completion center in China as well.

The Brazilian regional jet manufacturer, Embraer, also sees big opportunities in Asia.

“One of every four Embraer aircraft will be delivered to the Asia-Pacific region in the next 10 years,” Mark Dunnachie, VP Asia Pacific, said at a press briefing.

“We have the momentum of 176 sales and over 100 deliveries in 2015 – a strong 60% market share in the regional jet segment.”

Dunnachie said Embraer plans to improve on the current LCC model in Asia, which he called unsustainable and in need of change.

“Direct connectivity is key for the development of air transport in the Asia-Pacific region,” he said. “For those who travel from A to C, they have to go via B.”

That’s not a practical solution for the traveler, he said.

“Direct connectivity is a must, and Embraer will provide that solution.”

Fuel-efficient aircraft no longer hot properties

The recent rout in oil prices have taken a bite out of the sales prospects of all new, fuel-efficient aircraft, evidenced at the recent Dubai Air Show and now in Singapore.

Vinay Bhaskara, senior business analyst at Airways Magazine, notes that the impetus for new fuel-saving technologies came at a time when oil prices were above the $90/barrel mark.

“The Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus A320neo technologies offer cash savings in operating cost per seat miles of up to 8% (about $3 savings per gallon) against its preceding technology,” he says. “With current fuel prices, airlines are looking at pricing and capital deployment rather than fuel-saving capabilities.”

In other words, fuel-efficient aircraft have shifted from being essential purchases to nice-to-haves.

And that’s being reflecting in the order books.

New orders for some aircraft

Both Boeing and Airbus secured small, yet significant orders in Singapore.

The American-based builder announced a commitment for 12 Boeing 737s (eight -8 MAX, three -9 MAX and one -900ER) with China’s first privately owned airline, Okay Airways.

In the announcement, Boeing CEO Ray Conner noted that the Beijing-based carrier became the first in its country to launch the 737-9 MAX.

That airplane has been unsuccessful in the competition against the Airbus A321neo – what Airbus’ Leahy called “the airline’s favorite.”

Leahy, in fact, took the opportunity to poke Boeing’s chest: “I know the ‘paper airplane company’ in Seattle loves to talk, I could give Boeing some advice on how to fill that hole,” referring to Airbus’s 68% dominance in the neo vs. MAX programs.

Airbus, for its part, announced an order for six A350-900s from Philippine Airlines, which will expand the airline’s reach into the United States and Europe.

The airline signed a memorandum of understanding worth $1.8 billion at list prices.

In addition, the Toulouse-based manufacturer announced that an undisclosed customer ordered 14 A330-900neo, bringing up the count to 186 aircraft for the new re-engined A330 program backlog.

Mitsubishi regional jet moves

In the regional jet segment, Miami-based Aerolease Aviation signed a letter of intent (LOI) for 10 Mitsubishi Regional Jets (MRJ) and options for 10 more.

This deal marks the first order for brand-new aircraft for the leasing company, which had specialized in dealing used cargo aircraft in the past.

It’s the first leasing company to show interest in the MRJ program.

In the turbo-prop segment, Aviation PLC – a leasing company based in Singapore –ordered five ATR 72-600s turbo props, valued at $130 million.

“The ATR is a superb aircraft for lessors,” said Patrick de Castelbajac, CEO of ATR. “Our success among leasing firms underlines our product’s ability to consolidate and expand regional connectivity in different operational environments.”

New life for old planes and long-haul routes

Its Canadian counterpart, Bombardier, announced a new 90-seat variant for its Q400 turboprop program, to enter service by 2018.

No similar aircraft in the market will have such capacity for passengers and cargo.

Bombardier also announced that Air Canada signed an LOI to purchase 75 CS300 aircraft, which includes 45 firm orders and 30 options with substitution rights to the smaller variant, the CS100.

This order gives life to the suffering CSeries program, which hadn’t seen any firm orders since September 2014.

British engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce said a new variant of its successful Trent XWB engine will fly with Singapore Airlines on its A350s.

The carrier plans to take delivery of its first A350-900 in 2019.

That plane will begin flying nonstop to the United States, resuming the airline’s direct flights to Los Angeles and the world’s longest to New York, both suspended in November 2013.

Rolls-Royce says the new engine, with enhanced performance, will offer a 1% improvement in fuel burn over the preceding version.

The British manufacturer claims to have a 50% market share in global orders for widebody aircraft engines.

CEO seeks compensation from Airbus

Qatar Airways and its controversial CEO, Akbar Al Baker, were at the show with the airline’s two newest airliners, the Airbus A380 and A350.

Al Baker told reporters he’s seeking compensation from Airbus after rejecting the delivery of the first A320neo powered by Pratt & Whitney’s PW 1100GTF engines in December because of alleged cooling issues.

Al Baker said PW is a long way from providing a solution, and until then the airline will not take delivery of the aircraft.

Despite the low number of orders and commitments, there was an overall feeling that the aviation industry in the region is booming and there’s nothing but a bright future ahead for airlines, manufacturers and MRO businesses.

All eyes remain on Farnborough in July, where perhaps Boeing could announce its long-waited middle-of-the-market airliner, and Airbus could decide on a larger A350, adding a new page to this never-ending competition story."

Airbus to develop humanoid robots with global researchers - Professional Engineering,"Fri, 12 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmltZWNoZS5vcmcvbmV3cy9uZXdzLWFydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLXRvLWRldmVsb3AtaHVtYW5vaWQtcm9ib3RzLXdpdGgtZ2xvYmFsLXJlc2VhcmNoZXJz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Engineering news





Airbus Group Innovations (AGI), the research and technology network of Airbus Group, has launched a joint robotics research programme with Japan’s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) and France’s National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS).

The programme will be dedicated to the research and development of humanoid robotic technology to perform complex manufacturing tasks in factories.

The majority of research will be conducted at the CNRS-AIST Joint Robotics Laboratory (JRL), which was established in 2004 on the AIST campus in Tsukuba, Japan.

Sébastien Remy, head of AGI, said: “The use of robotics has become ubiquitous in our industry. Both AIST and CNRS researchers are at the cutting edge of humanoid robotics research, and we are excited about the opportunity to meld our expertise with theirs on the further development of this key technology for manufacturing.”

Airbus Group and the CNRS-AIST JRL are also collaborating on COMANOID, a four-year research project launched in early 2015 as part of the European Commission’s Horizon 2020 programme, which aims at deploying humanoid robots to achieve non-added value tasks that have been identified by Airbus Group in civilian airliner assembly operations.

Introducing this technology into aeronautical assembly lines is expected to support human operators in performing the most tedious and physically demanding parts of the manufacturing process, freeing up highly skilled workers to perform higher, value-added tasks. Designing robots with a humanoid form will enhance both their dexterity and versatility, making them suitable for tackling a large range of tasks in a variety of environments – all without having to make significant changes to manufacturing processes originally designed for humans.

Realising viable humanoid robotics will require researchers to develop new algorithms in multi-contact planning and control to give robots the sort of human ‘hand-eye coordination’ that will allow them to function effectively in confined and poorly accessible spaces. These algorithms will be tested on a set of use-cases drawn from different Airbus Group divisions and plants, in which the realism and complexity will be increased every year."
Bench Seating Is the Latest Idea to Make Flying Even More Horrible - WIRED,"Tue, 23 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS8yMDE2LzAyL2JlbmNoLXNlYXRpbmctaXMtdGhlLWxhdGVzdC1pZGVhLXRvLW1ha2UtZmx5aW5nLWV2ZW4tbW9yZS1ob3JyaWJsZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The fact that American butts are getting bigger would be less of a problem if the cheap seats on airliners weren't simultaneously getting smaller. Alas, neither trend shows any sign of abating. The obesity epidemic is as bad as ever, and airlines remains as desperate as ever to cram as many customers as possible into their planes.

If things are going to get any better, airlines need solutions more creative than saying, ""Let's just jam more people in there."" Airbus has an idea that just may fit the bill: Replacing individual seats with benches that flight crews can reconfigure on the fly to suit passengers of different shapes and sizes.

This month, the European aerospace giant received a US patent for a ""reconfigurable passenger bench seat,"" which is exactly what it sounds like. Instead of three seats side-by-side, Airbus would provide a bench of the same overall width. It features seat belts that can be attached at various points, easily accommodating two, three, or four passengers.

The idea is that providing more choices in configuration will allow airlines to optimize seating. ""Optimum utilization of the space available in a passenger cabin is of major economic importance,"" the patent argues. The cabin layout ""should be as flexibly, rapidly, was easily reconfigurable as possible.""

Of course, Airbus sees this as a way of maximizing comfort, by allowing those of larger stature to have a little more room, and convenience, by allowing families with small children to sit in the same row. The cynical among you may see this as a way of cramming four adults into space previously occupied by three, or generating new ""services"" that justify charging passengers more money. Whatever side of that debate you come down on, the point may well be moot.

""It's not gonna happen,"" says Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst with the Teal Group. Aviation interiors simply don't change this radically, certainly not with any speed. The investment is enormous, in part because the rules that govern aircraft are so strict. Seats in commercial aircraft must be able to withstand a forward force of 16Gs without breaking---the test that measures that decelerates a dummy-loaded row of seats from 44 feet per second to a dead stop in under a tenth of a second. They must be flame retardant, and must adhere to a mandate that an airplane can be fully evacuated within 90 seconds. The seats must protect occupants from ""debilitating leg and spine injuries"" in the event of a crash, and must hold their shape so they don't trap passengers. There's no obvious reason to think a bench seat would be less capable of meeting those standards, but getting anything to pass all the required tests is a Herculean undertaking measured in years, not months.

Still, Aboulafia says, it's not a bad idea to stack up intellectual property (Airbus holds many patents for everything from A to B), and who knows where this could be used.

A Canadian engineer unveiled a design concept for a new Antipode hypersonic jet plane that can fly from New York to London in 11 minutes.

Antipode can carry ten people at a time and fly up to 20,000km per hour.



The new jet concept follows engineer Charles Bombardier’s earlier hypersonic jet concept, the Skreemr, which is capable of carrying 75 passengers, to reach the speed of Mach 10.

US astronaut Scott Kelly announced that crew members at the International Space Station (ISS) have grown a zinnia flower.

The announcement was made through Kelly’s Twitter account.

The orange coloured, 13-petal flower is the first plant grown at the ISS. The achievement has given scientists on Earth the opportunity to better understand the process of growing plants in microgravity.

Russian aviation engineer Vladimir Tatarenko developed the concept of a detachable cabin for aircraft that could save lives in a crash.

After spending three years on the project, Tatarenko recently released a video, showcasing how the technology works during an emergency situation.

The prototype of the new cabin concept has a detachable cabin, which can be ejected at any time during takeoff, mid-air or landing and facilitate a safe landing for passengers.

China-based drone maker Ehang developed an autonomous drone prototype, Ehang 184, that can carry humans.

The human-sized drone was displayed at CES 2016 in Las Vegas. Ehang 184 is equipped with eight propellers and four arms. It can carry one person.

The prototype looks similar to a helicopter. By pressing two buttons, take off and land, the flier can reach his destination. The autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV) can be used in shipping, medical care and retail, as well as other sectors in the transportation industry.

Airbus Defence and Space and OneWeb formed a joint venture, OneWeb Satellites, to develop 900 satellites that will offer high-speed internet globally.

The OneWeb constellation of low Earth orbit satellites is intended to provide connectivity to remote areas worldwide, with more than ten terabits per second of new capacity by 2019.

OneWeb Satellites, equally owned by Airbus and OneWeb, will also build satellites, platforms and equipment for other operators. The equipment will be marketed by Airbus.

Virginia Tech researchers found new technology to prevent frost on aircraft surfaces, inspired by the Namib Desert Beetle.

The new solution uses chemical micro patterns to control the growth of frost caused by condensation.

Researchers used photolithography to pattern chemical arrays that attract water over the top of a surface that repels water, which controlled the spread of frost.

Nasa selected Orbital ATK, SpaceX and Sierra Nevada to deliver cargo to the International Space Station (ISS).

Under commercial resupply service (CRS-2) contracts, the companies will deliver critical science, research and technology equipment to ISS from 2019 to 2024.

Under the contract, companies will also be responsible for bringing back surplus cargo, research samples and other cargo from the ISS back to Earth.

Boeing announced it will reduce the production rate of its 747-8 in order to align supply with near-term demand in the cargo market.

The reduction is the fourth for the company in less than two years.

Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Ray Conner said: ""Global air passenger traffic growth and airplane demand remain strong, but the air cargo market recovery that began in late 2013 has stalled in recent months and slowed demand for the 747-8 freighter.""

Of the 750-plus A350 XWB orders received to date, approximately one-third are from Asia-Pacific customers. According to Joost van der Heijden, Airbus' Head of Marketing for Asia, the A350 XWB is the “right aircraft” for Asia-Pacific, which is confirmed by its growing commercial success in the region.

“The A350 XWB's higher capacity and lower seat-mile costs make it ideal to accommodate Asia’s strong traffic growth in the most profitable way, while its superior comfort and brand-new cabin provide additional passenger attractiveness in a competitive and comfort-sensitive Asian market,” he added.

Asian carriers ordering the aircraft are AirAsia X, Air China, Asiana Airlines, Cathay Pacific, China Airlines, Hong Kong Airlines, Japan Airlines, Singapore Airlines, SriLankan Airlines, Thai Airways International (THAI) and Vietnam Airlines – which received its no. 1 A350 XWB during 2015.

A growing A350-900 fleet in airline service around the globe

The A350 XWB began commercial operations with launch customer Qatar Airways in January 2015 following an extended flight test campaign that ensured high maturity and reliability at service entry. A total of 15 of these A350-900 versions had been delivered as of January 31 to four operators on four continents – Qatar Airways, Vietnam Airlines, Finnair and TAM Airlines. The global fleet has accumulated more than 21,000 flight hours in service to 17 destinations worldwide, with an average daily utilisation of 11.6 hours.

These figures will continue to grow as the A350 XWB operator base expands, including Singapore Airlines – which is soon to receive its no. 1 aircraft. This long-time Airbus customer was the first to commit to the A350 XWB with an agreement for 20 in 2006. Since then, its acquisition has grown to 67 aircraft, reflecting Singapore Airlines' confidence in the programme and the jetliner’s new-generation benefits.

Singapore Airlines’ orders include seven Ultra Long Range versions of the A350-900, enabling non-stop service to the U.S. West Coast, as well as New York. Designated the A350-900ULR, they will ‎include a modified fuel system to augment the fuel carrying capacity and a corresponding increase in maximum take-off weight. Initial deliveries are planned for 2018.

As the A350 XWB programme continues moving forward on the commercial side, a major industrial milestone achieved earlier this month has brought the product line's longest-fuselage member – the A350-1000 – another step closer to reality.

The first A350-1000 version takes shape

A350-1000 build-up is now underway on Airbus' A350 XWB final assembly line in Toulouse, France, where this version will be built concurrently with the A350-900. Underscoring the high degree of commonality between the A350-900 and A350-1000, all final assembly line stations can accommodate both aircraft types.

The A350-1000 can carry a total of 366 passengers in a typical three-class configuration, and integrates Airbus’ standard comfort in economy class with 18-inch-wide seats at nine-abreast, while its range of 7,950 nm. represents a significant revenue-generating advantage for operators. To date, the A350-1000 has received 181 orders from 10 customers around the globe.

During the Singapore Airshow, the presence of an A350-900 in the static and flying display is being complemented by Air Transport World magazine’s recognition of the A350 XWB programme. This leading airline industry publication selected the A350 XWB for its 2016 Aviation Technology Achievement Award, an honour presented to Kiran Rao – Airbus’ Head of Strategy – during a gala dinner in downtown Singapore."

news by Alasdair Whyte 5 February 2016 Print this page

Airbus Helicopters has recently taken a demonstrator H145 helicopter to the German coast to demonstrate the fenestron-tail aircraft in a variety of different roles.

Working with operators familiar with the challenges of the North Sea, Airbus carried out demo flights including marine pilot transfer, wind turbine support and cargo transport. In late January, the H145 flew with Wiking Helikopter Service and HTM Offshore to show its capabilities.

“One of our main activities is the transfer of harbour pilots via helicopter in any kind of weather conditions 24×7” explains Lars Hilgert, Wiking’s Chief Flight Coordinator. “Marine pilots navigate ships safely in and out of German harbours. In most cases these pilots are brought onto the moving ships using the winch. This process requires the utmost attention of the helicopter’s pilot and crew“, he added. “We are very positively surprised with the intuitive Helionix® cockpit of the H145 and its 4-axis autopilot with auto-hover function. These systems contribute to the helicopter’s high levels of safety in every scenario. At the same time the workload of the crew is reduced, allowing them to safely accomplish their mission even in the harshest of weathers“.

The flights with Wiking also included the EMS role. “Our rescue helicopters are constantly on stand-by for offshore HEMS. Every unit is staffed with a doctor and an assistant and ready to embark on a mission in a minimum amount of time. The H145 would qualify perfectly for these missions, given that it features tremendous levels of performance and a spacious cabin“, explained Alexander von Plato, Managing Director at Wiking Helicopter Service.

Wiking currently operates three AgustaWestland AW139s, three Sikorsky S76s and one hoist-equipped AgustaWestland AW109S Grand.

The flight test programme also included other missions such as wind-farm support, using the Alpha Ventus installation of 12 turbines and its central transformer platform, which has its own helipad. Flights included hoisting technicians on/off the turbines in somewhat typical winter North Sea winds of up to 50 knots.

“HTM Offshore is specialised in the transfer of service personnel in the wind industry” says Bernd Brucherseifer, Managing Director at HTM Offshore. “The technicians are increasingly used for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance missions on wind turbines, for instance if the turbine is not, or hardly accessible by ship due to rough waters. With wind parks emerging increasingly further away from the coastline we are reliant on a versatile but also efficient helicopter fleet. The H145 would be an ideal addition to our 11 Airbus Helicopters H135, as it can carry more passengers and travel for longer distances. Despite its spacious cabin the main rotor has a very small diameter, making it perfectly suited for approaching wind turbines.”

A total of 11,500 hours have been flown by the global H145 fleet since the first delivery in July 2014, with an availability of over 90%. The fleet numbers 53 helicopters in 14 nations, predominantly in the EMS market."

The company will offer Skynet services to U.S. customers for global security and humanitarian operations.

Airbus Defence and Space relocated Skynet 5A from 6 degrees east to 95 degrees east over the Asia Pacific in September 2015 to provide global X-band and Ultra-High-Frequency (UHF) coverage. The Skynet network now offers global military coverage, expanding core service reach for the U.K. military and augmenting coalition capabilities in the region.

Last year, Airbus Defence and Space worked with CopaSAT, and its terminal partner Tampa Microwave, to conduct a series of successful network tests using the Skynet 5A satellite. CopaSAT teams, using CopaSAT’s teleport infrastructure and Tampa Microwave’s remote manpack and fly-away terminals, as well as various other small terminals, conducted end-to-end testing to confirm operation of an entire network and the performance of Skynet 5A at the new orbital slot.

Airbus Defence and Space owns and operates the hardened Skynet X-band satellite constellation of eight satellites and the ground network to provide Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) communications to the U.K. Ministry of Defence. The contract also allows other NATO and allied governments such as members of the five-eyes community (besides the U.K., the U.S., Australia, New Zealand and Canada) to use the Skynet system to augment their existing services."

The no. 1 A350-1000 is one of three test aircraft that will be utilised for this model’s certification process, with the maiden flight scheduled before the end of the year.

To facilitate the concurrent A350-900 and A350-1000 production, Airbus has introduced three new “stations” in its Toulouse, France A350 XWB final assembly line—where A350-900 versions have been assembled since 2012.

The additions are a third Station 50 (where the forward, centre and aft fuselage sections are joined, along with nose landing gear installation); a fourth Station 40 (for wing-fuselage junction and tailplane installation); and a fourth Station 30 (for ground testing and cabin furnishing activities).

Underscoring the high degree of commonality between the A350-900 and A350-1000, all final assembly line stations—including the newest three—can accommodate both aircraft types.

As a further measure for accommodating concurrent A350-900 and A350-1000 production, Airbus is increasing the number of A350 XWB final assembly line employees from its current level—approximately 1,500—to some 1,900 by 2018.

British MoD Acquires Solar-Powered Zephyr UAV - Defense News,"Wed, 17 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXIvMjAxNi8wMi8xNy9icml0aXNoLW1vZC1hY3F1aXJlcy1zb2xhci1wb3dlcmVkLXplcGh5ci11YXYv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,". NOTE EMBARGO TIME OF 6 PM WASHINGTON OR 7AM SINGAPORE TIME.

SINGAPORE — The British Ministry of Defence purchased a solar-powered UAV capable of flying almost on the edge of space .

Two of the Zephyr 8 machines built by Airbus Defence and Space were acquired for operational concept demonstration work by the British, the MoD will announce Thursday.

Powered by the sun, the vehicle, known officially as a high-altitude pseudo-satellite, is capable of flying for more than a month at an altitude of between 65,000 feet and 70,000 feet.

The earlier Zephyr 7 holds the world record for 14 days continuous flight set in 2010. The aircraft charges its batteries from sunlight during the day. The new Zephyr 8 has a wingspan of 25 meters, is 30 percent lighter and can carry 50 percent more batteries than its predecessor.

An updated version of the UAV is already on the drawing board, Airbus executives told reporters during a briefing last year.

The executive said last year the MoD planned to buy three machines although only two have subsequently been ordered.

The deal marks the first sale of the Zephyr 8. The first vehicle is already under construction with a maiden flight scheduled for mid-2017, Airbus said in a statement.

Airbus said the precise purposes for which the MoD will use its Zephyrs have not been disclosed. Last November, the government's strategic defense and security review indicated the vehicle, which can undertake roles such as persistent surveillance and communications relay, would be part of a £2 billion (US $3.6 billion) equipment capability hike for special forces.

No contract value was given but Defence Procurement Minister Philip Dunne, answering a parliamentary question earlier this week, said the overall package was worth more than £10 million.

""The £10.6 million contract ... is for an operational concept demonstration rather than individual platforms, so unit costs are not held. Furthermore, as the Zephyr demonstrators will not be in service, they will not be based at a particular location and there will be no related support or through-life costs,"" he told lawmakers.

""This contract will allow the UK to understand whether Zephyr can fulfill the requirement for a high-altitude persistent surveillance capability,"" he said.

The Airbus executive said the German and Singaporean governments had expressed an interest in the machine.

Spain: 'Airbus 8' Trial Starts Amid Protest for Right To Strike - teleSUR English,"Tue, 09 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVzdXJlbmdsaXNoLm5ldC9uZXdzL1NwYWluLUFpcmJ1cy04LVRyaWFsLVN0YXJ0cy1BbWlkLVByb3Rlc3QtZm9yLVJpZ2h0LVRvLVN0cmlrZS0yMDE2MDIwOS0wMDI0Lmh0bWzSAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy50ZWxlc3VyZW5nbGlzaC5uZXQvYW1wL25ld3MvU3BhaW4tQWlyYnVzLTgtVHJpYWwtU3RhcnRzLUFtaWQtUHJvdGVzdC1mb3ItUmlnaHQtVG8tU3RyaWtlLTIwMTYwMjA5LTAwMjQuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The workers are being prosecuted under a law that has not been applied since General Francisco Franco's dictatorship.

The controversial trial of striking workers commonly referred to as the ""Airbus Eight” started Tuesday in Getafe, near Madrid, while hundreds protested across the country to express their support for the cause.

The trade unionists each face up to eight years and three months in prison for “acting with violence” and “attacking the right to work” during a general strike held Sept. 29, 2010, in protest of the labor reform pushed by the then socialist government of President Jose Luis Zapatero.

On that day, while the general strike paralyzed most of the country, over 500 Airbus employees picketed the gates of their employer in Getafe. Riot police were deployed to disperse them and upon arrival fired various warning shots causing panic to break out among the protesters, who ran for shelter inside the Airbus factory. About seven people were injured.

Prosecutors based their legal strategy on Article 315.3 of the Spanish Penal Code, which condemns striking workers with prison sentences. This law has not been used since 1972 when dictator Gen. Francisco Franco was in power.

ANALYSIS: Repression and Demobilization in Spain

The workers' lawyers denied the facts and criticized the prosecutors for failing to accuse the workers individually, while instead blaming union leaders (also members of the company's committee) for the violence.

Several left-wing political leaders attended the trial, including Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias, PSOE member Cesar Luena, and United Left representative Cayo Lara. In the meantime, hundreds took to the streets of Getafe, Madrid and other cities to express their support for the strikers on trial.

The trial is scheduled to end on Saturday, and sentencing will be announced in the following days.

Beside the high-profile case of the Airbus Eight, over 300 Spanish employees are currently facing prison sentences because of striking actions, and are at the heart of a campaign led by trade unions UGT and CCOO entitled “Striking is not a crime.”

Former Uruguayan President Jose Mujica called on Spanish authorities Tuesday to drop the charges against the strikers and urged them to modify the Franco-era law.

Mujica said the trials “along with the recently-adopted 'Gag Law,' are concrete examples of a condemnable policy aimed at criminalizing social protest.”

ANALYSIS: Spain's 'Gag Law' a Draconian Step Back say Critics

The European Trade Union Confederation also issued a press release in which they express their support for the strikers, saying, “The right to strike is a fundamental right, and in Spain’s Constitution. To strike is not a crime and to be a trade unionist is not a crime—so why are the authorities pursuing this legal action? The charges should be dropped before this ridiculous story goes to trial.”"

Now in operation with NHV Group in Den Helder and Aberdeen, with more than 3.000 flight hours since December 2014. First VIP aircraft to be delivered this year; Public Services version on track for 2017 delivery. Virtual reality experience available at HAI.

Louisville, Kentucky, After little more than one year of operations, NHV have reached 3,000 flight hours with their H175 fleet, demonstrating the aircraft’s mission capability and reliability in oil and gas offshore transportation. Early February, the first H175 that entered service in December 2014, reached the 1,000 flight-hour milestone.“This milestone was easily achieved thanks to the exceptional availability of the aircraft, which is close to 95%” said Eric Van Hal, CEO of NHV Group. “The H175 has proven to be a highly reliable aircraft. I am happy to say that the helicopter really keeps its promises, allowing us to meet the needs of our customers”.NHV was the launch customer for the new super medium helicopter and has since taken delivery of six aircraft out of 16 on order. The H175 is currently in operation at two of NHV’s bases in the demanding North Sea environment: Den Helder in the Netherlands and Aberdeen in northern Scotland. So far, the NHV fleet of H175s has completed 1,500 flights and carried approximately 22,000 passengers.“Since its entry into service, the H175 has been proving its value and high availability every day with our launch customer NHV, which generated a lot of attention for this helicopter” said Guillaume Faury, President and CEO of Airbus Helicopters. “Thanks to its endurance, flexibility, high level of safety, excellent payload and cost-effectiveness, we are shaping the future of the market with the H175”.Despite the challenging market environment, 2015 proved to be a successful year for the H175 which registered 36 orders and was endorsed by key oil and gas players such as Milestone and Bristow. During the last 12 months, the capabilities of the aircraft have also been expanded through a flight envelope extension in hot and high conditions. The Public Services version was also launched last year thanks to a 7-unit order from Hong Kong operator GFS, with deliveries planned in 2017.In 2016, the H175 will be deployed in the Gulf of Mexico for Oil and Gas operations by the Mexican customer Pegaso. This year will also see the entry into service of the VIP variant introducing new mission capabilities, as well as the certification of SAR modes. The maximum take-off weight (MTOW) extension will be increased to 7800 kg, offering customers a 300 kg payload gain or an increased radius of action of 40 nautical miles.This year’s Heli-Expo visitors will have the opportunity to experience a virtual ride aboard the H175. A 360º video will take them inside the cockpit next to the pilot to enjoy a smooth flight inside the cabin, or to discover the high-end cabin interior of the executive version.Airbus Helicopters, a division of Airbus Group, provides the most efficient civil and military helicopter solutions worldwide. Its in-service fleet includes nearly 12,000 helicopters operated by more than 3,000 customers in 154 countries. Airbus Helicopters employs more than 22,000 people worldwide and in 2015 generated revenues of 6.8 billion Euros."
Humanoid robots in tomorrow's aircraft manufacturing - Phys.org,"Mon, 15 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDE2LTAyLWh1bWFub2lkLXJvYm90cy10b21vcnJvdy1haXJjcmFmdC5odG1s0gFDaHR0cHM6Ly9waHlzLm9yZy9uZXdzLzIwMTYtMDItaHVtYW5vaWQtcm9ib3RzLXRvbW9ycm93LWFpcmNyYWZ0LmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Planning and control of multi-contact movements by humanoid robots.

Developing humanoid robotic technology to perform difficult tasks in aircraft manufacturing facilities is the goal of a four-year joint research project, which is being conducted by the Joint Robotics Laboratory (CNRS/AIST) and Airbus Group. It will officially be launched on 12 February 2016 at the French Embassy in Tokyo. The introduction of humanoids on aircraft assembly lines will make it possible to relieve human operators of the most laborious and dangerous tasks, thus allowing them to concentrate on higher value-added ones. The primary difficulty for these robots will be to work in a confined environment and move without colliding with the numerous surrounding objects. This is the first issue researchers will have to solve by developing new algorithms for the planning and control of precise movements.

Due to the size of aircraft (for example airliners), and the very high number of tasks to be executed on a limited number of units, the use of specialized fixed-base robots, like those already in use by the automotive industry, is impossible in the aeronautical industry. There are other difficulties as well, for even if robots with mobile bases and robotic arms can be used by the industry (as with Airbus Group for example), they are limited in their ability to move, since they cannot climb stairs or ladders, or move past obstacles on the floor, etc. For its part, the Joint Robotics Laboratory (JRL, CNRS/AIST) is developing, by way of HRP-2 et HRP-4 robot models, new technologies known as multi-contact locomotion: by making use of its entire body to make contact with its environment, and not just its feet, this type of robot can climb ladders and enter confined spaces. Multiple points of contact also make it possible to increase a robot's stability, as well as the force it can apply when executing a task. Moreover, the anthropomorphic form of these robots offers greater versatility of use to execute a large number of different tasks in varied environments.

The collaboration between JRL researchers and Airbus Group therefore aims to enable humanoid robots to execute manipulation tasks in the limited and confined environment of assembly lines, where they must make coordinated use of their bodies in order to successfully complete their mission. In fact, these cramped spaces necessitate particular postures. With the calculations for such postures proving to be mathematically complex, the researchers must firstly develop new algorithms that are much more powerful than existing ones, while keeping the calculations sufficiently fast in order for the movement of the robot to remain efficient. Typical tasks to be executed by robots include, for instance, tightening a bolt, cleaning metallic dust from an area, or inserting parts in the structure of an airplane. They could also verify that systems are functioning properly once manufacturing is complete.

These algorithms will be tested on a set of scenarios drawn from the needs of the different branches of Airbus Group (Civil Aviation, Helicopters, and Space), which will become increasingly realistic over the years. With regard to research in robotics, in addition to the contribution of new algorithms, this collaboration will perhaps highlight the deficiencies of current robots (design, precision or power, for example). It could also make it possible to define, in the next 10 to 15 years, the specifications for the first generation of humanoid robots dedicated to the manufacture of large structures.

"Airbus reverses A330 production tailoff, now has order backlog of 6800 planes - Euronews","Wed, 24 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cm9uZXdzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDE2LzAyLzI0L2FpcmJ1cy1yZXZlcnNlcy1hMzMwLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tdGFpbG9mZi1ub3ctaGFzLW9yZGVyLWJhY2tsb2ctb2YtNjgwMC1wbGFuZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus, which has just announced record orders for 2015, is to boost production of its A330 planes partially reversing a previous decision to build fewer of the wide-body jets.

Airbus is to boost production of its A330 planes, partially reversing a previous decision to build fewer of the wide-body jets.

That is partly linked to a provisional order from Iran for 45 of them.

The earlier production cut – from 10 planes to seven per month – was intended to move customers towards updated versions of the A330 and the launch of its new A350.

Airbus also announced it has record numbers of orders. Chief Executive Officer Tom Enders told reporters: “We’ve seen another year of robust performance in commercial aircraft. Our customers, believe it or not – largely thanks to the oil and kerosene price – are globally, financially in very good shape.”

When crude oil prices were well over $100 a barrel airlines were desperate to get their hands on more fuel efficient planes.

So, with the collapse in oil prices will that still be the case?

Jeremy Cook, Chief Economist with World First, thinks there is no need to worry: “Oil prices are low and may head lower, but this isn’t a longer term issue for markets; and oil prices may repair up to $50,$60,$70 a barrel, then you’d have to say that airlines are still going to be looking for fuel efficient vehicles with which to operate their business.”

Airbus Group said 2015 operating earnings before one-off items rose 2 percent to 4.13 billion euros as revenue gained 6 percent to 64.45 billion. However the European planemaker gave a cautious outlook for this year, underlining what many analysts see as a tricky, transitional year between old and new models for it and US rival Boeing.

It received orders for 1,080 jetliners last year, which means it has a backlog of 6,800 aircraft.

There are plans to deliver 650 this year, up from 635 in 2015, thence its focus on increasing productivity.

Euronews spoke with Airbus Chief Financial Officer Harald Wilhelm about that.

euronews: “By the look of Airbus’ record order book, the biggest challenge will be actually to deliver all these planes on time. How are you going to achieve that?

Harald Wilhelm, Airbus Chief Financial Officer: “Take the example of the A350 – you might say ‘Oh, you produced 14 aircraft in 2015 and in 2016 you are going to produce more than 50, how does that work?’ Actually as we speak, we already have more than 30 aircraft on the final assemby line. So we are running the rate up as we speak. And that means making sure that the supplies of parts coming from everywhere in the world are there on time, and at the quality needed.”

euronews: “Two trade unions have protested against your decision to ask employees to clock in already in their work clothes. What’s happening with that?”

Harald Wilhelm: “That’s under discussion. All in all, you know, this is one step where we want to further increase the efficiency in our plants. So you can see that as a demonstration of our productivity efforts.

euronews: “Can you get the unions on board?”

Harald Wilhelm: “I’m very trustful that they will find a resolution on that.”

euronews: “How is the sharp fall in oil prices impacting demand for fuel efficient planes?”

ADVERTISEMENT

Harald Wilhelm: “I know that’s an area of question marks and concerns for many, and I understand why. But let’s look at the facts. Since the oil price started to drop at the end of 2014 we did not see a decline in orders and how can we explain that? That oil price situation helps to improve the profitability and the cash situation of our customers, so it makes the acquisition of the fuel-efficient aircraft very affordable for the future times when the fuel price might be higher.”

euronews: “Qatar Airways warned last week that the slowdown in emerging economies, mainly China, could have a negative impact on the airline industry. Do you share those worries?”

Harald Wilhelm: “I’m not saying that there might not be a risk here and there, that some customers might take perhaps a bit less aircraft than scheduled at the beginning or re-adjust. Our massive backlog of 6,800 aircraft allows us to do that and to accomodate.”

euronews: “Airbus employs more than 16,000 people in the United Kingdom. What if UK voters decide to leave the European Union in June, what are the consequences for Airbus UK operations?”

Harald Wilhelm: “Clearly, as industrial and business people, we prefer that the UK stays in the EU. We have a clear framework in place, which is good for the efficiency of Airbus at large, but also for the efficiency and the investments in the UK. Our preference is very clear: for the UK to stay inside.”"
Singapore Airlines signs FHS-TSP contract with Airbus for its A380 fleet - Aerospace Technology,"Mon, 15 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm9zcGFjZS10ZWNobm9sb2d5LmNvbS9uZXdzL25ld3NzaW5nYXBvcmUtYWlybGluZXMtZmhzLXRzcC1jb250cmFjdC1haXJidXMtYTM4MC1mbGVldC00ODExODQyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Singapore Airlines (SIA) has entered a ten year flight hour services, tailored support package (FHSTSP) contract with Airbus for 19 units of A380s.

Under the deal, Airbus will provide full component support, line and base airframe maintenance, as well as fleet technical management services to SIA’s A380 fleet.

Airbus will also provide maintenance, engineering, reliability and supply chain management services to SIA and to its affiliated MRO SIA Engineering Company (SIAEC).

The contract, similar to one covering SIA’s A330s fleet, supersedes an existing FHS Components support contract between Airbus and SIA in 2007 for the latter’s A380 fleet.

The new deal covers aircraft availability and on-time performance (OTP) services.



""This Airbus FHS-TSP selection by Singapore Airlines for its A380 fleet marks a significant endorsement of our ability to deliver tailored and competitive value-adding services.""

Airbus customer services head Didier Lux said: ""This Airbus FHS-TSP selection by Singapore Airlines for its A380 fleet marks a significant endorsement of our ability to deliver tailored and competitive value-adding services.""

More than 245 operators of A320, A330, A380 and A350 family aircraft have currently selected Airbus FHS contracts.

The France-based plane maker has sold more than 16,300 aircraft to over 380 customers worldwide.

Through its ‘Services by Airbus’, the company provides flight hour and tailored support packages, upgrades, training, e-solutions, engineering and maintenance, flight operations air traffic management, and material management services.

In November, budget carrier Tigerair Singapore signed a FHS-TSP contract with Airbus for full component support and fleet technical management services for its A320 fleet.

The contract has a validity of ten years, starting from early this year.

Airbus CEO against Honeywell's merger with United Technologies - Yahoo Movies UK,"Wed, 24 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vdWsubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvYWlyYnVzLWNlby1hZ2FpbnN0LWhvbmV5d2VsbHMtbWVyZ2VyLTIzMjQ0MDkxNS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Reuters) - Airbus Group SE (AIR.PA) Chief Executive Tom Enders said in statement on Wednesday that he did not see how a combination of Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) and United Technologies Inc (UTC) (UTX.N) would be in his company's interests.

""I am under the impression that the leadership of UTC shares my assessment,"" Enders said in the emailed statement. Airbus is one of the biggest customers of both Honeywell and UTC.

UTC said on Monday that a merger with Honeywell could either be blocked outright by antitrust authorities or be conditioned on significant divestitures after a lengthy and disruptive review period that would destroy shareholder value. Honeywell countered that it did not see the regulatory process as a ""material obstacle"" to the deal.

Frankfurt Airport officially welcomes Lufthansa’s latest Airbus A320neo - Aviation24.be,"Sat, 13 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdmlhdGlvbjI0LmJlL2FpcmxpbmVzL2x1ZnRoYW5zYS1ncm91cC9sdWZ0aGFuc2EvZnJhbmtmdXJ0LWFpcnBvcnQtb2ZmaWNpYWxseS13ZWxjb21lcy1sdWZ0aGFuc2FzLWxhdGVzdC1haXJidXMtYTMyMG5lby_SAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXZpYXRpb24yNC5iZS9haXJsaW5lcy9sdWZ0aGFuc2EtZ3JvdXAvbHVmdGhhbnNhL2ZyYW5rZnVydC1haXJwb3J0LW9mZmljaWFsbHktd2VsY29tZXMtbHVmdGhhbnNhcy1sYXRlc3QtYWlyYnVzLWEzMjBuZW8vYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"New aircraft type sets another milestone in quality and comfort for passengers / Latest aircraft generation designed to provide effective noise reduction

Today (February 12) Deutsche Lufthansa officially launched the world’s first Airbus A320neo aircraft at its Frankfurt Airport (FRA) home base. Lufthansa is thus deploying the latest aircraft generation – equipped with state-of-the-art technology – from the FRA global hub, offering passengers yet another milestone in quality and travel comfort. With the A320neo, Lufthansa’s fleet at FRA is supplemented by another “world first” in aviation. Frankfurt Airport already hosts a number of other latest-generation aircraft models,including the Airbus A380 and A350, as well as the Boeing models B787 (Dreamliner), B747-8 and B777.

Lufthansa intends to deploy a total of five new Airbus A320neo aircraft from FRA by the end of 2016. Fraport, the owner and operator of Frankfurt Airport, welcomes Lufthansa’s latest fleet enhancement, since the A320neo is one of the quietest and most energy-efficient aircraft models for short and medium-haul flights. The departure noise footprint of the new aircraft type is almost 50 percent smaller than that of its predecessor, according to aircraft manufacturer Airbus. More interesting facts about the A320neo can be found at: https://www.lufthansagroup.com/en/themen/airbus-a320neo.html.

All new A320neo aircraft will also be equipped with vortex generators on delivery, which have an additional noise-reducing effect. Detailed information on this topic is available at: https://www.lufthansagroup.com/en/responsibility/climate-and-environmental-responsibility/active-noise-abatement/refitting-existing-aircraft.html

Aviation fans already had the opportunity to welcome the new Airbus model on January 22, when the A320neo landed for the first time at Frankfurt Airport. To capture the event, a video was produced, which can be watched at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WMostJi654 .

Frankfurt Airport has always been a pioneer in welcoming new generations of aircraft. To master the challenges that can be related to the introduction of new aircraft types, Fraport has always been closely cooperating with aircraft manufacturers and airlines. For example: Fraport was actively involved in the launch of the world’s largest passenger aircraft, the Airbus A380. From 2005, ground-handling trials and test flights with the A380 were conducted at Frankfurt Airport. In the summer of 2014, Fraport also welcomed the new Airbus A350 XWB on its test flight from Iqualit in the Canadian Arctic to Frankfurt.

Airbus seeks patent for 'airplane benches' that adjust for passenger size - CBC.ca,"Mon, 22 Feb 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL3RyZW5kaW5nL2ltLXRpcmVkLW9mLXRoZXNlLWJlbmNoZXMtb24tMS4zNDU5MDY10gEgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JjLmNhL2FtcC8xLjM0NTkwNjU?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus, a French airplane manufacturer known for patent ideas that on occasion both amaze and horrify, has a new idea to toss your way.

Envision this: benches on a plane.

Instead of three average-sized people complaining about three different seats, two large people could complain about one long bench.

Or, alternatively, one bench could support an entire family, happy or otherwise.

There's room for the entire family on one bench seat. (U.S. Patent Office)

The patent application for a ""Re-Configurable Passenger Bench Seat"" was published by the U.S. Patent Office on Feb. 18.

Consumerist suggested that it's unlikely these benches would be used for the average flyer's convenience and comfort.

""We don't expect to see flight attendants going around making tweaks at customers' demand,"" wrote Consumerist's Chris Morran of the patent application.

""Instead, this is likely being seen as something that airlines could use as an upsell: Want to fly in a row with your two young kids and your spouse? Fine, but that will be $X for seat customization.""

Another possible use is to accommodate overweight passengers who are especially uncomfortable in airplane seats, or to better fit the needs of elderly or disabled people.

This latest idea fits in among the company's other notable patent applications: Retractable bicycle seats (but on a plane) and a system that transports people in cabins designed like storage containers.

Another Airbus patent application from the last two weeks is for a storage space inside a seat, instead of below it.

Disappearing leg room

Consumerist noted that a drawback with this design is that it would eliminate some precious leg room.

Since the 1970s, leg room (defined as ""seat pitch"") has decreased from 35 inches to 31 inches on average. The width of the seat itself hasn't fared much better, tightening up to 16.5 inches from 18, according to Forbes.

Meanwhile, an amendment that would have regulated the amount of leg room available per passenger failed to pass through Congress two weeks ago.

Steve Cohen, a Tennessee Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives, declared that poor leg room could be more than just uncomfortable for passengers.

""It is about safety and health. The FAA requires that planes be capable of evacuation in 90 seconds or less, but the FAA hasn't conducted emergency evacuation tests on airlines with a distance between rows of less than 29 inches,"" said Cohen, according to The Economist. ""Some airlines fly with rows as close as 28 inches apart."""
