Airbus to Pay Record $4 Billion to Settle Global Bribery Scheme - WilmerHale,"Wed, 05 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpbG1lcmhhbGUuY29tL2luc2lnaHRzL2NsaWVudC1hbGVydHMvMjAyMDAyMDUtYWlyYnVzLXRvLXBheS1yZWNvcmQtNC1iaWxsaW9uLXRvLXNldHRsZS1nbG9iYWwtYnJpYmVyeS1zY2hlbWXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On January 31, 2020, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) agreed to resolve allegations that Airbus SE (“Airbus”), a France-based aerospace company, used third-party business partners to bribe government officials and airline executives to obtain certain business advantages, including lucrative aircraft contracts, in violation of the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”).1 Airbus agreed to pay approximately $4 billion in combined penalties to the United States, France, and United Kingdom to resolve eight years of investigation, making it the largest resolution in FCPA history.2

Airbus entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement (“DPA”) with the DOJ related to a two-count criminal information filed in the District of Columbia.3 The information charged Airbus with one count each of (1) conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA, and (2) conspiracy to violate the Arms Export Control Act (“AECA”) and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”).4

The DOJ’s investigation proceeded in parallel with a joint investigation conducted by the UK Serious Fraud Office (“SFO”) and the French Parquet National Financier (“PNF”).5 The DOJ and State Department also investigated the ITAR-related conduct.6

Airbus Resolution

DOJ Settlement

In its lengthy DPA, the DOJ Criminal Division, Fraud Section (“the Fraud Section”), DOJ National Security Division (“NSD”), and United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia (“DC USAO”) agreed to file a two-count criminal information and forfeiture action in the District of Columbia.7

Airbus did not receive voluntary disclosure credit for reporting the FCPA-related conduct because it only did so after the SFO’s investigation became public, but Airbus did receive full cooperation credit for assisting the investigation by: (1) gathering evidence and performing forensic data collections in multiple jurisdictions; (2) proactively identifying issues and facts that would likely interest the Fraud Section and DC USAO; and (3) presenting relevant facts to the Fraud Section and DC USAO.

The Company also received remediation credit, and the DPA noted the rapid remedial measures taken by Airbus, focusing in particular on steps taken to quickly terminate relationships with business partners involved in the alleged bribery-related conduct. Specifically, Airbus froze payments to business partners, terminated relationships with them, and applied enhanced due diligence procedures to vet future business partners. The DPA also emphasized efforts to implement a more robust compliance program and to take disciplinary action against former employees.8

Airbus did receive voluntary disclosure credit for reporting ITAR-related conduct and credit for cooperating with the investigation. The DPA details Airbus’s efforts to engage in remedial measures and to enhance its compliance program and internal controls.

The resolution of parallel investigations by French and British authorities and the State Department impacted the penalties imposed by the DOJ. For example, Airbus will be subject to oversight by French authorities rather than an independent monitor under the DPA. In addition, despite imposing a total criminal fine of $2.3 billion—$2.1 billion for FCPA violations and $237.7 million for ITAR violations—the DOJ reduced this amount to $527 million ($294.5 million for the FCPA charges and $232.7 million for the ITAR charges), and an additional $55 million as part of a civil forfeiture agreement for the ITAR-related conduct, after crediting amounts paid to France and the UK.

PNF Settlement

The PNF agreed to suspend prosecution of Airbus for three years.9 Airbus must submit its compliance program to targeted audits by French anti-corruption authorities and pay a $2.29 billion fine.10

SFO Settlement

The SFO launched an investigation into Airbus in 2016 after the Company reported inaccuracies in its disclosures to the country’s export credit agency. The SFO agreed to enter a three-year DPA with Airbus. Because French authorities will monitor Airbus, the SFO, like the DOJ, declined to impose an independent compliance monitor.

The SFO indictment, which is suspended for the term of the DPA, includes five counts of failure to prevent bribery involving Airbus’s Commercial and Defense & Space divisions.11 The indictment focused on conduct occurring between 2011 and 2015 in Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan and Ghana.

Under its agreement with the SFO, Airbus must pay $1.09 billion to British authorities, including disgorgement of profits.12 The $1.09 billion payment to British authorities is the largest ever UK settlement.13

State Department Settlement

The State Department entered into a Consent Agreement with Airbus, under which the State Department agreed to a $10 million settlement for civil violations of ITAR. In exchange, Airbus agreed to retain an independent export control compliance officer to ensure that Airbus’s export control systems comply with ITAR. The State Department agreed to suspend $5 million of the total settlement amount, provided these funds are used for remedial compliance measures.

The Relevant Conduct

Bribery-Related Violations

The FCPA charge stemmed from an alleged scheme to direct bribes to foreign officials to obtain and retain business from both privately-owned entities and entities owned and controlled by foreign governments.

Between 2008 and 2015, members of the Company’s Strategy and Marketing Organization (“SMO”) allegedly used consultants to pay bribes to government officials and executives at various state-owned airlines to purchase Airbus aircraft and satellites. The SMO concealed the bribes by creating fraudulent contracts, receiving fake invoices for services never performed, and creating false activity reports for business partners. The alleged conduct spanned multiple countries—including Japan, Russia, China and Nepal.

Over the course of the entire period under review by the United States and other enforcement authorities, Airbus, among other things, allegedly paid (1) $50 million to AirAsia Group directors through the sponsorship of a sports team owned by two AirAsia executives to induce more plane orders; (2) $2 million to the wife of a Sri Lankan Airlines executive through a shell company; (3) $3.3 million to senior staff at Indonesia’s national airline; and (4) millions to secure orders for military aircraft from the Ghanaian government.

The United States’ investigation centered on an alleged bribery scheme in China. Between 2013 and 2015, Airbus allegedly paid business partners in China who used these payments as bribes to government officials in China. To conceal these transactions, Airbus made payments into a bank account in Hong Kong in the name of a company that was controlled by another business partner instead of paying the business partner directly. Airbus, through its employees, executives, and agents, also invited executives from Chinese airlines and their families to the United States for all-expense-paid events in Park City, Utah, and Maui, Hawaii.

Airbus China and a Chinese government entity established a monetary fund in 2011 in which Airbus China made contributions to the fund in exchange for speeding up the allocation of aircrafts to airlines in China. According to the DPA, the stated purpose of the fund was to support projects “related to services for the Chinese commercial aviation industry, including but not limited to aviation related management education, seminars, and pilot educational facilities.” However, from 2012 to 2017, the fund was used to, among other things, pay event agencies to host social events such as golf retreats and leisure events for Chinese government officials.

ITAR Violations

The ITAR charge arose from Airbus’s failure to report political contributions, commissions or fees paid to third-party business partners relating to the sale or export of defense articles or defense services.14 Airbus also retained third-party business partners who had failed to register as required by ITAR.

Airbus and the Government of Québec become sole owners of the A220 Programme as Bombardier completes its ... - Airbus,"Thu, 13 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMC0wMi1haXJidXMtYW5kLXRoZS1nb3Zlcm5tZW50LW9mLXF1ZWJlYy1iZWNvbWUtc29sZS1vd25lcnMtb2YtdGhlLWEyMjDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bombardier transfers its remaining interest in Airbus Canada Limited Partnership (Airbus Canada) to Airbus SE and the Government of Québec

Airbus now holds 75 percent of Airbus Canada with the Government of Québec increasing its holding to 25 percent for no cash consideration

Bombardier work packages for the A220 and A330 will be transferred to Airbus, through its subsidiary Stelia Aerospace, securing 360 jobs in Québec

Bombardier will receive US$591M, net of adjustments, of which US$531M was received at closing, and is released of its future funding capital requirement to Airbus Canada

Over 3,300 Airbus jobs secured in Québec

Amsterdam / Montreal – Airbus SE (EPA: AIR), the Government of Québec and Bombardier Inc. (TSX: BBD.B) have agreed upon a new ownership structure for the A220 programme, whereby Bombardier transferred its remaining shares in Airbus Canada Limited Partnership (Airbus Canada) to Airbus and the Government of Québec. The transaction is effective immediately.

This agreement brings the shareholdings in Airbus Canada, responsible for the A220, to 75 percent for Airbus and 25 percent for the Government of Québec respectively. The Government’s stake is redeemable by Airbus in 2026 - three years later than before. As part of this transaction, Airbus, via its wholly owned subsidiary Stelia Aerospace, has also acquired the A220 and A330 work package production capabilities from Bombardier in Saint-Laurent, Québec.

This new agreement underlines the commitment of Airbus and the Government of Québec to the A220 programme during this phase of continuous ramp-up and increasing customer demand. Since Airbus took majority ownership of the A220 programme on July 1, 2018, total cumulative net orders for the aircraft have increased by 64 percent to 658 units at the end of January 2020.

""This agreement with Bombardier and the Government of Québec demonstrates our support and commitment to the A220 and Airbus in Canada. Furthermore it extends our trustful partnership with the Government of Québec. This is good news for our customers and employees as well as for the Québec and Canadian aerospace industry,” said Airbus Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury. ""I would like to sincerely thank Bombardier for the strong collaboration during our partnership. We are committed to this fantastic aircraft programme and we are aligned with the Government of Québec in our ambition to bring long-term visibility to the Québec and Canadian aerospace industry.”

“I am proud that our government was able to reach this agreement. We have succeeded in protecting paying jobs and the exceptional expertise developed in Québec, despite the major challenges we faced in this regard when we took office. We have consolidated the government’s position in the partnership, while respecting our commitment not to reinvest in the program. By opting to strengthen its presence here, Airbus has chosen to focus on our talents and our creativity. The decision of an industrial giant like Airbus to invest more in Québec will help attract other world-class prime contractors,” the Premier of Québec, François Legault, stated.

“This agreement is excellent news for Québec and its aerospace industry. The A220 partnership is now well established and will continue to grow in Québec. The agreement will allow Bombardier to improve its financial situation and Airbus to increase its presence and footprint in Québec. It’s a win–win situation for both the private partners and the industry,” pointed out Pierre Fitzgibbon, Minister of the Economy and Innovation.

With this transaction, Bombardier will receive a consideration of $591M from Airbus, net of adjustments, of which $531M was received at closing and $60M to be paid over the 2020-21 period. The agreement also provides for the cancellation of Bombardier warrants owned by Airbus, as well as releasing Bombardier of its future funding capital requirement to Airbus Canada.

“This transaction supports our efforts to address our capital structure and completes our strategic exit from commercial aerospace,” said Alain Bellemare, President and CEO Bombardier, Inc. “We are incredibly proud of the many achievements and tremendous impact Bombardier had on the commercial aviation industry. We are equally proud of the responsible way in which we have exited commercial aerospace, preserving jobs and reinforcing the aerospace cluster in Québec and Canada. We are confident that the A220 program will enjoy a long and successful run under Airbus’ and the Government of Québec’s stewardship.”

The single aisle market is a key growth driver, representing 70 percent of the expected global future demand for aircraft. Ranging from 100 to 150 seats, the A220 is highly complementary to Airbus’ existing single aisle aircraft portfolio, which focuses on the higher end of the single-aisle business (150-240 seats).

As part of the agreement, Airbus has acquired the Airbus A220 and A330 work package production capability from Bombardier in Saint-Laurent, Québec. These production activities will be operated in the Saint Laurent site by Stelia Aéronautique Saint Laurent Inc., a newly created subsidiary of Stelia Aerospace, which is a 100 percent Airbus subsidiary.

Stelia Aéronautique Saint-Laurent will continue the production of the A220 cockpit and aft fuselage production, as well as A330 workpackages, for a transition period of approximately three years at the Saint-Laurent facility. A220 workpackages will then be transferred to the Stelia Aerospace site in Mirabel to optimize the logistical flow to the A220 Final Assembly Line also located in Mirabel. Airbus plans to offer all current Bombardier employees working on the A220 and A330 work packages at Saint-Laurent opportunities around the A220 programme’s ramp-up, ensuring know-how retention as well as business continuity and growth in Québec.

At the end of January 2020, 107 A220 aircraft were flying with seven customers on four continents. In 2019 alone, Airbus delivered 48 A220s, with the further ramp-up to be continued.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9973458647727966}",neutral,0.9973458647727966,0

Their first foothold was a single part, a partition wall, that would need to be additively manufactured. In the years since they first showed the part, other kinds of fabrication processes have been woven into the generative design framework. Airbus can now make the same part by 3D printing a mold and casting it in a material already certified for flight.

Today, Airbus is using generative technologies to design entire factories, solving for operational efficiency, construction cost, and eight other variables at once. The result will be a better factory that is adaptable to Airbus’s evolving manufacturing needs. They meanwhile continue to generatively design various aircraft parts, from nacelles in the engine to the vertical tail plane.

Engineering design site Eureka! recently published a detailed piece on Airbus and generative design that’s definitely worth a read.

Airbus' Blended-Wing Maveric Hits the Skies - WIRED,"Sun, 16 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9haXJidXMtbWF2ZXJpYy1ibGVuZGVkLXdpbmctamV0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Since commercial air travel took off in the 1950s, much has changed—tighter seats, safer flights, the rise and fall of seat-back screens—but not the nature of the planes themselves. The tube-and-wing design, after all, is reasonably efficient and structurally sound. And what other shapes would fly? Cubes?

Probably not. But one idea that's been in the air since the 1990s is catching a second wind, thanks to a new effort by Airbus. This week at the Singapore Air Show, the European planemaker revealed a little model of an aircraft it says could slash fuel consumption by 20 percent compared to today’s single-aisle jets. The Maveric—the name is an acronym for “model aircraft for validation and experimentation of robust innovative controls”—is the latest incarnation of the blended-wing body.

Want the latest aviation news in your inbox? Sign up here!

As the name suggests, the triangular Maveric blurs the distinction between wing and body. The airfoil design generates lift across the entire fuselage rather than just the wings—meaning more power goes further—and reduces drag. In an industry where efficiency improvements generally come from tweaks to engine and aircraft design that provide 1 or 2 percent bumps, a 20 percent improvement would be massive. With engines above the fuselage, the Maveric would create less noise for those on the ground, and it could accommodate new propulsion systems, including hybrid and electric power plants. For passengers, the design would mean fewer window seats (boo!) but more possibilities for alternative seating configurations and more creative space allocation.

Airbus launched the design program in 2017, and the Maveric, which is 6.5 feet long with a 10.5-foot wingspan, first took flight last year. The rapid progress isn’t too surprising, as the design challenges of the blended-wing body are largely understood. The remotely piloted X-48 Hybrid Wing Body completed more than 100 flights before NASA and Boeing wrapped their joint project in 2012. And the Northrop B-2 bomber has been flying for nearly 30 years.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.864526629447937}",neutral,0.864526629447937,0
Opinion: Airbus Can Coast On Its Product Line; Boeing Cannot - Aviation Week,"Wed, 05 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9hZXJvc3BhY2UvYWlyY3JhZnQtcHJvcHVsc2lvbi9vcGluaW9uLWFpcmJ1cy1jYW4tY29hc3QtaXRzLXByb2R1Y3QtbGluZS1ib2VpbmctY2Fubm900gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"One of incoming Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun’s first actions has been to order a rethink of the company’s new midmarket airplane (NMA). This is the right move. It has never been clear how the NMA, a twin-aisle design, could match the economics of the single-aisle A321neo.

Yet Calhoun should keep in mind three realities that weigh on Boeing’s new product strategy. First, the middle market is booming, and Airbus is winning it with the A321neo. Second, Airbus can expand and update its single-aisle and midmarket product line. The third is that Boeing cannot do that. There is a lot at stake for Boeing and not much time.

First, airlines clearly want midsize jets. Last year, there were just 673 net orders for all Airbus and Boeing jets; 476 of these were for the A321neo. This is more than just upgauging; much is due to increasing airline route fragmentation, a trend that will keep growing for years to come.

This midmarket growth also reflects a shift away from twin-aisles (Boeing’s strongest position) and toward single-aisles (where Airbus is strongest). Airbus has sold 3,255 A321neos since the type was launched in 2011, or three times as many as the 1,049 Boeing 757s sold over 25 years. By contrast, Boeing has sold around 650 737 MAX 9/10s (the company does not break out variant orders). The A321neo is winning by a 5:1 ratio.

While the 737 MAX 8 has done well against the A320neo, as the A321neo continues to grow in popularity, it will bolster Airbus’ smaller single-aisles, as airlines seek commonality across their fleets.

Second, Calhoun should remember that there is quite a lot that Airbus can do with its single-aisle product line. In addition to increasing commonality between the A220 and A320 families, it could stretch the former C Series, creating a 145-150-seat A220-500, likely offering lower seat-mile costs.

While an A220-500 would take away demand for the A320neo, Airbus could compensate by making the A320neo and A321neo more capable models. The A220’s wings use resin transfer infusion (RTI) composites. Adapting this technology for the A320/321neo, perhaps with an engine update, would produce 150-240-seat jets with greater range and superb economics.

Most intriguingly, if the A321neo can be stretched, Airbus would have an even greater midmarket category killer. With new RTI wings and new, more powerful engines, an A322neo would be a true global route-fragmentation machine, building on the Boeing 787’s remarkable work in creating new thinner routes.

Third, by contrast with this incredible menu of Airbus possibilities, Boeing can do nothing more to the 737. The MAX 9/10 and MAX 200 are clearly outclassed by the A321neo, and there is probably nothing that Boeing can do to make them more competitive.

Most of all, the 737 family has clearly reached the end of its evolutionary line. After the MAX program, there will not be a fifth 737 incarnation. Boeing needs a new clean-sheet, single-aisle model eventually.

Analysts, including me, point to the McDonnell Douglas experience as an example of what can happen when a jetmaker neglects new product investment. But there is a difference. When McDonnell absorbed Douglas in 1967, it inherited a single-aisle jet—the DC-9—that proved reasonably well-suited to updates. And its MD-80 series was a success, staying in production through 1999. This also allowed McDonnell to address the core of the single-aisle market, albeit in a declining way, without having to launch any new products.

But if Boeing is to copy McDonnell and neglect investment in its jetliner business, it will not have 30 years to coast. The 737 MAX will have 10-12 years before it needs replacement.

And unlike during the McDonnell sunset years, the market is shifting upward. If Boeing does not build a clean-sheet midmarket airplane, it will lose at least 15%, and perhaps 20%, of the market. What was a 50/50 duopoly will become a 65/35 duopoly, or perhaps even a 70/30 one. In an industry that is heavily dependent on volume to achieve the lower costs that airline customers demand, such a market-share decline would be tough to recover from.

Whether Calhoun remains as CEO or not, Boeing needs to digest the clear conclusion from these three realities: Product development inaction is a recipe for Airbus market dominance, possibly for decades to come.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.915450394153595}",positive,0.915450394153595,1
Airbus reveals its blended wing aircraft demonstrator - Airbus,"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMC0wMi1haXJidXMtcmV2ZWFscy1pdHMtYmxlbmRlZC13aW5nLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWRlbW9uc3RyYXRvctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Singapore, 11 February 2020 – Airbus has revealed MAVERIC (Model Aircraft for Validation and Experimentation of Robust Innovative Controls) its “blended wing body” scale model technological demonstrator.

At 2 metres long and 3.2 metres wide, with a surface area of about 2.25m², MAVERIC features a disruptive aircraft design, that has the potential to reduce fuel consumption by up to 20% compared to current single-aisle aircraft. The “blended wing body” configuration also opens up new possibilities for propulsion systems type and integration, as well as a versatile cabin for a totally new on-board passenger experience.

Launched in 2017, MAVERIC first took to the skies in June 2019. Since then the flight-test campaign has been on-going and will continue until the end of Q2 2020.

“Airbus is leveraging emerging technologies to pioneer the future of flight. By testing disruptive aircraft configurations, Airbus is able to evaluate their potential as viable future products,” said Jean-Brice Dumont, EVP Engineering Airbus. “Although there is no specific time line for entry-into-service, this technological demonstrator could be instrumental in bringing about change in commercial aircraft architectures for an environmentally sustainable future for the aviation industry.”



Airbus is using its core strengths and capabilities of engineering and manufacturing, in close collaboration with an extended innovation ecosystem, to accelerate traditional research and development cycles. By doing this Airbus is able to achieve proof of concepts, at a convincing scale and speed, thereby driving forward maturity and increasing their value.



Through AirbusUpNext, a research programme, Airbus is currently working on a number of demonstrator projects in parallel; E-FAN X (hybrid-electric propulsion), fello’fly (v-shaped “formation” flight) and ATTOL (Autonomous Taxi Take-Off & Landing).

· 2019 dividend proposal: € 1.80 per share, +9% versus 2018

· 2020 guidance to set the path for sustainable growth

Amsterdam, 13 February 2020 – Airbus SE (stock exchange symbol: AIR) reported Full-Year (FY) 2019 consolidated financial results and provided guidance for 2020.

“We achieved a great deal in 2019. We delivered a strong underlying financial performance driven mainly by our commercial aircraft deliveries,” said Airbus Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury. “The reported earnings also reflect the final agreements with the authorities resolving the compliance investigations and a charge related to revised export assumptions for the A400M. The level of confidence in our ability to continue to deliver sustainable growth going forward has led to a dividend proposal of € 1.80 per share. Our focus in 2020 will be on reinforcing our company culture, improving operationally, and adjusting our cost structure to strengthen the financial performance and prepare for the future.”

Net commercial aircraft orders increased to 768 aircraft (2018: 747 aircraft), including 32 A350 XWBs, 89 A330s and 63 A220s. At the end of 2019, the order backlog reached 7,482 commercial aircraft. Airbus Helicopters achieved a book-to-bill ratio by value above 1 in a difficult market, recording 310 net orders in the year (2018: 381 units). This included 25 helicopters from the Super Puma family, 23 NH90s and 10 H160s. Airbus Defence and Space’s order intake by value of € 8.5 billion was supported by A400M services contracts and key contract wins in Space Systems.

Consolidated order intake in 2019 increased to € 81.2 billion (2018: € 55.5 billion) with the consolidated order book valued at € 471 billion on 31 December 2019 (end December 2018: € 460 billion).

Consolidated revenues increased to € 70.5 billion (2018: € 63.7 billion), mainly driven by the higher commercial aircraft deliveries and a favourable mix at Airbus, and to a lesser extent the favourable exchange rate development. A record 863 commercial aircraft were delivered (2018: 800 aircraft), comprising 48 A220s, 642 A320 Family, 53 A330s, 112 A350s and 8 A380s. Airbus Helicopters recorded stable revenues supported by growth in services, which offset lower deliveries of 332 rotorcraft (2018: 356 units). Revenues at Airbus Defence and Space were broadly stable compared to the previous year.

Consolidated EBIT Adjusted – an alternativeperformance measure and key indicator capturing the underlying business margin by excluding material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructurings or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses – increased to € 6,946 million (2018: € 5,834 million), mainly reflecting the operational performance at Airbus, partially offset by Airbus Defence and Space’s performance and additional ramp-up costs.

Airbus’ EBIT Adjusted increased by 32% to € 6,358 million (2018: € 4,808 million), largely driven by the A320 ramp-up and NEO premium, together with good progress on the A350.

On the A320 programme, NEO aircraft deliveries rose by 43% year-on-year to 551 aircraft. The ramp-up continued for the Airbus Cabin Flex (ACF) version of the A321 with almost 100 more deliveries than in 2018. The Airbus teams are focused on securing the ongoing ACF ramp-up and improving the industrial flow. Airbus is discussing further ramp-up potential for the A320 programme beyond rate 63 per month with the supply chain, and already sees a clear path to further increase the monthly production rate by 1 or 2 for each of the 2 years after 2021. The breakeven target for the A350 was achieved in 2019. Given overall customer demand for widebody aircraft, Airbus expects A330 deliveries of approximately 40 aircraft per year beginning in 2020 and the A350 to stay between a monthly rate of 9 and 10 aircraft.

Airbus Helicopters’ EBIT Adjusted increased to € 422 million (2018: € 380 million), mainly reflecting an increased contribution from services and lower research and development costs. This was reduced by a less favourable delivery mix.

EBIT Adjusted at Airbus Defence and Space declined to € 565 million (2018: € 935 million), mainly reflecting the lower performance in a competitive Space environment and efforts to support sales campaigns. The Division is targeting a restructuring programme to address its cost structure and restore profitability to a high single digit margin.

During 2019, 14 A400M military transport aircraft were delivered in line with the latest delivery schedule, bringing the in-service fleet to 88 aircraft at year-end. Several key milestones towards full capability were achieved in the year, including the simultaneous deployment of paratroopers and helicopter air-to-air refuelling dry contacts. In 2020, development activities will continue towards achieving the revised capability roadmap. Retrofit activities are progressing in line with the customer-agreed plan. While the rebaselining of the A400M programme was completed and significant progress has been made on technical capabilities, the outlook is increasingly challenging on exports during the launch contract phase, also in light of the repeatedly extended German export ban to Saudi Arabia. As a result, the Company has reassessed its export assumptions on future export deliveries for the launch contract phase and recognised a charge of € 1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019.

Consolidated self-financed R&Dexpenses totalled € 3,358 million (2018: € 3,217 million).

Consolidated EBIT(reported) was € 1,339 million (2018: € 5,048 million), including Adjustments totalling a net € -5,607 million. These Adjustments comprised:

€ -3,598 million related to the penalties;

€ -1,212 million related to the A400M charge;

€ -221 million related to the suspension of defence export licences to Saudi Arabia by the German government, now prolonged to March 2020;

€ -202 million related to A380 programme cost;

€ -170 million related to the dollar pre-delivery payment mismatch and balance sheet revaluation;

€ -103 million related to Premium AEROTEC’s restructuring plan launched to improve its competitiveness;

€ -101 million of other costs, including compliance costs partially offset by positive capital gains from the Alestis Aerospace and PFW Aerospace divestments.

Consolidated reported loss per share of € -1.75 (2018 earnings per share: € 3.94) includes a negative impact from the financial result, mainly driven by the revaluation of financial instruments. The financial result was € -275 million (2018: € -763 million). The consolidated net loss(1) was € -1,362 million (2018 net income: € 3,054 million).

Consolidated free cash flowbefore M&A and customer financing improved by 21% to € 3,509 million (2018: € 2,912 million), mainly reflecting commercial aircraft deliveries and the earnings performance. Consolidated free cash flow was € 3,475 million (2018: € 3,505 million). The consolidated net cash position was € 12.5 billion on 31 December 2019 (year-end 2018: € 13.3 billion) after the 2018 dividend payment of € 1.3 billion and pension contribution of € 1.8 billion. The gross cash position on 31 December was € 22.7 billion (year-end 2018: € 22.2 billion).

The Board of Directors will propose the payment of a 2019 dividend of € 1.80 per share to the 2020 Annual General Meeting. This represents an increase of 9% over the 2018 dividend of € 1.65 per share. The payment date is 22 April 2020.

Outlook

As the basis for its 2020 guidance, the Company assumes:

- The world economy and air traffic to grow in line with prevailing independent forecasts, which assume no major disruptions, including from the coronavirus.

- The current tariff regime to remain unchanged.

The 2020 earnings and FCF guidance is before M&A.

· Airbus targets around 880 commercial aircraft deliveries in 2020.

· On that basis:

Airbus expects to deliver an EBIT Adjusted of approximately € 7.5 billion, and Free Cash Flow before M&A and Customer Financing of approximately € 4 billion before:

· € -3.6 billion for the penalty payments and;

· A negative mid-to-high triple digit million Euro amount for the consumption of compliance-related provisions for tax and legal disputes.

Adjustment Adjustment, an alternative performance measure, is a term used by the Company which includes material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses. EBIT Adjusted The Company uses an alternative performance measure, EBIT Adjusted, as a key indicator capturing the underlying business margin by excluding material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructurings or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses. EPS Adjusted EPS Adjusted is an alternative performance measure of basic earnings per share as reported whereby the net income as the numerator does include Adjustments. For reconciliation, see the Analyst presentation. Gross cash position The Company defines its consolidated gross cash position as the sum of (i) cash and cash equivalents and (ii) securities (all as recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position). Net cash position For the definition of the alternative performance measure net cash position, see Registration Document, MD&A section 2.1.6. FCF For the definition of the alternative performance measure free cash flow, see Registration Document, MD&A section 2.1.6.1. It is a key indicator which allows the Company to measure the amount of cash flow generated from operations after cash used in investing activities. FCF before M&A Free cash flow before mergers and acquisitions refers to free cash flow as defined in the Registration Document, MD&A section 2.1.6.1 adjusted for net proceeds from disposals and acquisitions. It is an alternative performance measure and key indicator that reflects free cash flow excluding those cash flows resulting from acquisitions and disposals of businesses. FCF before M&A and customer financing Free cash flow before M&A and customer financing refers to free cash flow before mergers and acquisitions adjusted for cash flow related to aircraft financing activities. It is an alternative performance measure and indicator that may be used from time to time by the Company in its financial guidance, especially when there is higher uncertainty around customer financing activities.

Leading position in civil and parapublic market maintained

Marignane, 13 February 2020 – Airbus Helicopters logged gross orders for 369 helicopters in 2019 (310 net orders), combined with its support and services revenue, worth more than € 7 billion. The company delivered 332 rotorcraft, including the landmark 1000th Super Puma, thus maintaining its lead in the civil & parapublic market with a 54% market share in terms of units.

On the civil side, the H125 and H145 remain best-sellers on the market with 130 and 91 bookings in 2019 respectively. Airbus Helicopters also reinforced its position in the military market thanks to key successes with international campaigns such as 23 NH90 for Spain and 25 H225M mainly for Hungary and Indonesia.

2019 saw Airbus Helicopters deploying its global support contracts on the military side with a key support contract for the NH90 in service in the German Army, the Tiger, Cougar and Caracal contracts in France, and a five-year extension of the through-life support contract for the Australian Army’s Armed Reconnaissance Helicopter (ARH) Tiger. On the civil side, 250 additional helicopters were covered by global HCare contracts.

“The increased contribution from support and services and key wins in the military sector in 2019 underlines the importance of our robust business model. The balance between our different revenue streams enables us to maintain our global leadership in a challenging civil and parapublic market” said Bruno Even, Airbus Helicopters CEO. “Our customers place their trust in our solutions and our goal is keep providing them with improved products and services that keep them flying,” he added.

Airbus Helicopters continues to invest in its product portfolio through continuous product improvements in order to maintain a competitive range, as with the new five-bladed version of the strong-selling twin-engine light H145 helicopter to be certified this year. The H125 will be offering a power increase to its customers that will enable them to carry up to an additional 190 kg. The H135 now offers an alternate gross weight that offers its operators an additional payload of 120kg. The soon-to-be-certified H160 delivers competitiveness thanks to its increased fuel efficiency and customer-centric simplified maintenance eco-system, and will also bring an array of breakthrough safety features with Helionix’s accrued pilot assistance and automated features as well as flight envelop protection.

Airbus Helicopters also progressed with a military version of the H160, unveiling a full-scale mock-up. The French Ministry of Armed Forces announced that the launch of its Joint Light Helicopter programme, for which the H160M has been selected, has been brought forward and will enable the first delivery to be advanced to 2026.

From an innovation perspective, 2019 saw good progress in the focus areas of autonomy, electrification and connectivity that will prepare the next generation of VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) aircraft. The fully electric CityAirbus demonstrator conducted its first flight, as did the prototype of the VSR700 unmanned aerial system that’s designed for military applications.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 1.0}",positive,1.0,1
The E-Fan X puts its aerodynamic design to the test - Airbus,"Tue, 04 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIwLTAyLXRoZS1lLWZhbi14LXB1dHMtaXRzLWFlcm9keW5hbWljLWRlc2lnbi10by10aGUtdGVzdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Wind tunnel testing is a critical milestone for any aircraft. For the E-Fan X, the test programme has offered invaluable insight into the hybrid-electric demonstrator’s aerodynamic design, low-speed performance and handling qualities in preparation for its first flight in 2021.

It’s an early July morning in Filton, UK, and a flurry of activity is underway at Airbus’ wind tunnel test centre. A scale model of a BAe 146 RJ100—a short-haul regional airliner originally designed in the 1980s—is being attached to the Filton wind tunnel in preparation for testing. In fact, it is the same wind tunnel model used in the certification of the original BAe 146 RJ100 aircraft.

But this test model is not exactly like the original.

The BAe 146 RJ100 aircraft is not designed to have hybrid-electric systems on board. We’re trying to take something that exists and turn it into a hybrid-electric demonstrator.

- Anna Calder, E-Fan X Overall Aircraft Design Engineer

The E-Fan X is Airbus’ hybrid-electric demonstrator. In the test aircraft based on the BAe 146 RJ100, one of the four jet engines will be replaced by a 2MW motor. Other modifications to the BAe 146 RJ100 include the addition of large, externally mounted heat exchangers for liquid cooling systems, as well as intakes and an exhaust for the fuselage-mounted power generation system.

If the E-Fan X is to embark on its first flight in 2021, engineers must understand how these modifications will impact the aircraft’s overall aerodynamic performance and handling qualities. And wind tunnel testing can provide invaluable insight in this respect.

E-Fan X: Wind tunnel testing

E-Fan X - wind tunnel test show more show less Discover how Airbus made the leap from the E-Fan—the first electric aircraft demonstrator developed in the Airbus portfolio—to the E-Fan X—the hybrid-electric demonstrator that is 30x more powerful than its predecessor

Wind tunnel testing: a key milestone for E-Fan X

Wind tunnels are tubes in which powerful fans are used to exert force and pressure on a scale model of an aircraft. The air moving around the static test model helps engineers to understand how a real aircraft would react to this pressure when flying. All Airbus aircraft undergo wind tunnel testing in preparation for flight. In addition to aircraft, spacecraft and rockets also undergo wind tunnel testing.

During its testing, the E-Fan X was attached to the Filton low-speed wind tunnel, whose test section measures 3.65 x 3.05 metres. Giant fans expelled air at speeds of up to 216 mph. Small threads attached to the test model enabled engineers to analyse the movement of air from a variety of angles. At a 1:8 scale model, the E-Fan X was tested at a wingspan of over 3 metres.

“The E-Fan X is an aircraft demonstrator, so it’s not optimised for aerodynamic design,” says Oliver Family, Airbus Head of Overall Aircraft Design, E-Fan X. “But to fly the demonstrator safely and efficiently, the aerodynamics impacts need to be fully understood.”

A wealth of insight into aerodynamic design & handling

For Airbus engineers, the key takeaway from wind tunnel testing is a better understanding of the E-Fan X’s overall aerodynamic design. In addition, the test programme offered insight on all aspects relating to low-speed performance and handling qualities.

“The only change we discovered during the test programme is that we need to modify the porosity of some of the devices inside the ducts to ensure they relate correctly to the full-scale E-Fan X model devices,” says Paul Gingell, Airbus Wind Tunnel Test Engineer.

Successful completion of wind tunnel testing marks another key milestone in the E-Fan X’s development. Future milestones include flight tests for characterisation and installation of the 2MW motor on the test aircraft in 2020.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999603033065796}",neutral,0.9999603033065796,0
Airbus MAVERIC | Would You Flying in a 'Blended Wing' Airplane? - Popular Mechanics,"Thu, 13 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHVsYXJtZWNoYW5pY3MuY29tL2ZsaWdodC9hMzA5MTYzOTIvbWF2ZXJpYy1haXJidXMtY29uY2VwdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A new Airbus prototype is a blended wing aircraft that could be used for commercial flights.

Flying wings and blended wings date back 100 years and have mostly been for military use.

The MAVERIC prototype is a scale model that's 3 meters wide, ideal for testing and showing off.

Airbus has released a new prototype for a “ giant flying wing ” that could revolutionize commercial flight. The MAVERIC prototype is 2 meters long by 3 meters wide and flown by remote control. Airbus says its aerodynamic body reduces its emissions by 20 percent.

The prototype is a “small scale demonstrator,” like a scale model that can show both supporters and potential investors the strengths and weaknesses of the radical new design. But Airbus say it’s up to the same construction standards and precision as full size Airbus planes. A full-size MAVERIC would carry passengers in a “single aisle” seating arrangement, meaning it would be a narrow-body aircraft. Large airliners are wide-body aircrafts, by contrast.

Airbus / S. Ramadier

For airlines, the difference between narrow- and wide-body aircrafts is usually fuel economy. Having multiple aisles and many more seats requires larger crews and flights must sell many more seats to break even. If a narrow-body plane could make longer flights, as Airbus has said it wants to do, smaller crews and smaller minimum passengers could make it worthwhile. But that could also bring stricter weight limits and even tighter quarters inside more traditional single-aisle planes fitted for longer flights.

A radically new design like the MAVERIC could address all of these concerns. Airbus says its interior is roomier than in a conventional plane, with engine placement that reduces noise and also increases interior space. A true “flying wing” design would be even more minimal, exemplified by modern bombers like the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit , which can carry 50 tons of fuel and just two crew members. The MAVERIC is a “blended wing,” which is still a tailless craft but has more interior room and a seamless transition from the cabin into the wings.

Open Gallery

But a flying wing isn't without its drawbacks. A true flying wing has all kinds of stability and design challenges related to the lack of a tail, the distribution of weight, and even how “thick” the front end is because it’s where the only people or cargo have to sit. None of this is inherently bad or implausible—every form factor of airplane has limitations and challenges—but it's likely why Airbus is drumming up public support with a working concept scale model

The MAVERIC does have a little tail-like area, with vertical stabilizers similar to twin- or even multi-boom airplanes . These stabilizers help to counteract some phenomena in high-speed flight and when the plane turns. The tail overall helps a traditional airliner to stay stable in gusting wind. These variables will need to be fully, exhaustively solved by Airbus before a blended wing passenger plane could ever take off.

Airbus

“The development of demonstrators like MAVERIC enables Airbus to accelerate understanding of new aircraft configurations and to mature the technology necessary to fly such a radically different aircraft,” Airbus says in a statement . “One specific challenge was to assess the low-speed and stall dynamics. Future testing will analyze aspects such as MAVERIC’s handling qualities, flight control, multi-objective control surfaces and modularity.”

In other words, the company still needs to see how the aircraft performs in moments of flight failure with the absence of a traditional airplane’s ailerons, flaps, spoilers, elevators, and even a tail. It’s doable, but it will take some time, and saving 20 percent of emissions would be more than worth it.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998478889465332}",neutral,0.9998478889465332,0

In January 2020, Boeing and Airbus delivered 13 and 31 commercial jets, respectively, compared to 46 and 39 deliveries in the same month last year. Boeing’s deliveries continue to suffer in the aftermath of two 737 MAX crashes and the subsequent deliveries halt and grounding of the fleet. Deliveries of 737 MAX aircraft have been suspended since March 2019. For the full year 2019, Boeing delivered 380 aircraft, while Airbus set a new all-time annual record, handing over 863 jets. Before this, Boeing had retained a deliveries lead over Airbus since 2012. In 2018, Boeing delivered 806 jets (763 in 2017), with Airbus handing over 800 (718 in 2017).

On December 16, Boeing announced its decision to temporarily suspend 737 MAX production from January 2020. Prior to this, Boeing had been producing 737 MAX jets at a reduced rate of 42 aircraft per month and thereby built up an inventory of aircraft ready to be shipped. In the meantime, test flights and software changes continue. Boeing has carried out more than 1,100 test flights with new MCAS software for a total of 2,100 flight hours.

On January 10, the FAA announced that it remains focused on following a thorough process for returning the 737 MAX to service. The FAA continues to work with other international aviation safety regulators to review the proposed changes to the aircraft. According to the FAA, their first priority is safety, and no clear timeline for the work’s completion has been set. Boeing is currently estimating that the grounding of the 737 MAX will be lifted during mid-2020.

Boeing says it will be a few years before the company will be able to hit the planned monthly production rate of 57 aircraft. American Airlines and United Airlines have pulled the 737 MAX from their schedules until August and September, respectively. On January 30, Spirit AeroSystems, the 737 MAX fuselage manufacturer, announced it had reached an agreement with Boeing for a restart of production and slow ramp-up of deliveries throughout the year to reach a total of 216 737 MAX shipsets delivered in 2020. To date, in total, Boeing has delivered 387 737 MAX jets. Of these, 256 were delivered in 2018, up from 74 in 2017.

In January, Boeing delivered three 737NGs, two 767s, two 777s, and six 787s. Boeing raised the monthly Dreamliner production rate to 14 aircraft during 2019 and handed over 158 787s last year – a new annual record. The company delivered 145 787s in 2018, up from 136 in 2017. The 787 production rate will be reduced from 14 to 12 aircraft per month in late 2020 and is expected to be further adjusted to 10 per month in early 2021, with a return to 12 per month in 2023. The 777 program awaits the 777X’s service entry. The first flight of the 777X was completed on January 25, 2020, and first delivery is targeted for 2021.

In January, Airbus delivered two A220s, 26 A320s (1 ceo / 25 neo), one A330, and two A350s. Airbus increased the official A320 production rate to 60 aircraft per month during 2019. The company is targeting an additional raise to 63 jets per month from 2021. Airbus is also discussing a further ramp-up with its supply chain and considers increasing the rate by one or two in 2022 and the same in 2023. This could bring the A320 production rate up as high as 67 aircraft per month by 2023 – equal to 804 jets per year, putting the company within reach of the 1,000 jets per year delivery mark.

For the full year 2019, Airbus handed over 642 A320 family aircraft, of which 551 were A320neos. This compares to a total of 386 A320neo Family aircraft delivered in 2018, up from 181 and 68 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2019, Airbus delivered a record 112 A350s, up from 93 and 78 in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Airbus increased the monthly A350 production rate to 10 during 2019. Airbus has been considering a further increase up to 13 A350s per month, but for 2020, the A350 is expected to stay at a monthly rate of 9-10 aircraft. Airbus expects to deliver 40 A330 jets in 2020, down from 53 in 2019.

Turning to the orders race, Boeing reported no new orders in January and zero cancellations. For the full year 2019, Boeing accumulated 243 gross orders (330 cancellations => -87 net new orders). For the full year 2018, Boeing booked 893 net new orders and 1,008 gross orders.

Airbus had a very strong month in January, booking 296 gross orders and 22 cancellations for a net of 274. The largest January booking was Air Lease Corporation’s order for 50 A220-300s, 52 A321neos, and one A350-900. Of the A321neos, 25 were “vanilla,” and 27 were A321XLRs. The order was originally announced as a Letter of Intent (LOI) at Paris Air Show in June 2019. Nearly as large was Spirit Airlines order for a mix of 100 A320neo family aircraft (47x A319 / 33x A320 / 20x A321). Spirit’s order more than doubled Airbus’ backlog of the A319neo, the smallest A320 version, to now 82 vs. 35 by the end of 2019. The order was originally announced as a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in October last year.

Other significant orders were China Aircraft Leasing Group’s (CALC’s) order for 40 A321neos, BOC Aviation’s order for 20 A320neos, and Air France’s order for 10 A350-900s. For the full year 2019, Airbus landed 1,131 gross orders (363 cancellations => net of 768) thereby retaking the orders crown from Boeing. In 2018, Airbus booked a total of 747 net new orders and 831 gross orders, thereby losing the 2018 orders race. Prior to this, Airbus had retained an orders lead over its rival every year since 2012.

At the end of January, Airbus reported a backlog of 7,725 jets – a new all-time backlog record – of which 6,800, or 88%, were A220 and A320ceo/neo family narrowbodies. The company’s previous all-time backlog record high of 7,577 jets was set in December 2018. By the end of January 2020, Boeing’s backlog (total unfilled orders before ASC 606 adjustment) was 5,612 aircraft (of which 4,582, or 82%, were 737 NG/MAX narrowbody jets). Boeing’s all-time backlog high of 5,964 aircraft was set in August 2018.

The number of Airbus aircraft to be built and delivered represents nine years of shipments at the 2019 production level. In comparison, Boeing’s backlog would “only” last seven years at the 2018 level, which we use as proxy for 2019 due to the drop in 737 MAX deliveries. This year to date, Boeing’s book-to-bill ratio, calculated as net new orders divided by deliveries, is zero (no orders received). Airbus’ book-to-bill ratio is 8.84, thanks to a very strong start in the orders race. In 2019, Boeing’s book-to-bill ratio was negative, due to more cancellations than orders, while Airbus reported a book-to-bill of 0.89.

2020 Forecast

Forecast International’s Platinum Forecast System® is a breakthrough in forecasting technology that – among many other features – provides 15-year production forecasts. The author has used the Platinum Forecast System to retrieve the latest delivery forecasts and, for 2020, Forecast International’s analysts expect Boeing and Airbus to deliver 568 and 913 large commercial jets, respectively.

Boeing was expected to provide some form of guidance for 2020 on January 29 in connection with the release of its 2019 earnings report; however, the 737 MAX uncertainty will likely mean management will be cautious and avoid providing an aircraft delivery target for the year. On February 13, Airbus reported 2019 earnings and announced a target of 880 commercial aircraft deliveries in 2020, which is up 2% from 863 in 2019.

Airbus bribery investigation highlights power of… - Transparency International,"Mon, 03 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYW5zcGFyZW5jeS5vcmcvZW4vcHJlc3MvYWlyYnVzLWJyaWJlcnktaW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbi1oaWdobGlnaHRzLXBvd2VyLW9mLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtY29vcGVyYXRpb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A €3.6bn (£3bn) corporate plea deal struck by Airbus to end a long-running corruption probe must now be followed up by prosecuting executives involved. Failing to hold individuals to account will damage public confidence and risks setting a precedent where big companies can buy their way out of trouble.

Courts in the UK, France and United States last week approved the deal – known as a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) – after the aerospace giant admitted to using middlemen to pay bribes to secure aircraft contracts.

Airbus itself will not be prosecuted under the terms of the DPA, meaning the company avoids a criminal conviction. However the UK’s Serious Fraud Office is still able to prosecute Airbus executives involved with the bribery.

Transparency International UK firmly believes that DPAs are only successful when they are followed up with investigations and prosecutions against individuals responsible for the wrongdoing.

Daniel Bruce, Chief Executive of Transparency International UK, said:

“The Airbus settlement figures are huge, certainly compared to previous Deferred Prosecution Agreements in the UK; this is to be welcomed. Large penalties are a quick and effective way to sanction companies for wrongdoing, but they should be but one of a number of consequences for egregious corruption cases such as this. Individual prosecutions in this case are vital to ensure that justice is seen to be done. Failing to go after those involved will give the impression that big companies play by a different set of rules and can simply buy their way out of trouble.

“Record-breaking settlements totalling billions of pounds are likely to grab the headlines here, but behind the numbers there are real people caught up in bribery and corruption cases. Endemic corruption in some of the world’s poorest countries costs lives and ruins many more, and bribery sanctioned by one of the world’s biggest companies helps perpetuate this.”

The SFO began investigating Airbus in 2016 after the company reported itself to authorities. Parquet National Financier, the French equivalent of the SFO, launched its own investigation in 2017.

Transparency International France had campaigned actively in 2016 to include CJIPs, the French version of DPAs, into law.

Marc-André Feffer, Chair of Transparency International France, said:

“Before the CJIP was implemented in France in 2016, no company had been convicted for corruption, leading to an unacceptable state a near-impunity in the last 15 years. The Airbus case is a good example of how this new judicial procedure is a powerful leverage in the hands of the Parquet National Financier (also a young institution created only in 2014). Huge fines are a quick and effective way to hit companies where it hurts while avoiding the long, complex and highly uncertain process of trials. However, the CJIPs now need to be evaluated and maybe improved to make sure it contains no potential loopholes and avoid to be a tool for companies to ‘buy their way out of trouble’.”

In France, the CJIP is an efficient tool that facilitates unprecedented international cooperation in major transnational bribery cases. However, we regret that no company has ever spontaneously come forwards to denounce their illicit wrong doing to French authorities. We will remain on the lookout.

"Airbus SE agrees to pay over $3.9 billion in global penalties, largest settlement to date - U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Newsroom","Wed, 05 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmljZS5nb3YvbmV3cy9yZWxlYXNlcy9haXJidXMtc2UtYWdyZWVzLXBheS1vdmVyLTM5LWJpbGxpb24tZ2xvYmFsLXBlbmFsdGllcy1sYXJnZXN0LXNldHRsZW1lbnQtZGF0ZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NEW YORK — Pursuant to an investigation by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) New York, working with the Department of Justice, Airbus SE (Airbus or the company), a global provider of civilian and military aircraft based in France, has agreed to pay combined penalties of more than $3.9 billion to resolve foreign bribery charges with authorities in the United States, France and the United Kingdom arising out of the company’s scheme to use third-party business partners to bribe government officials, as well as non-governmental airline executives, around the world and to resolve the company’s violation of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) and its implementing regulations, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), in the United States. This is the largest global foreign bribery resolution to date.

Airbus entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the department in connection with a criminal information filed Jan. 28 in the District of Columbia charging the company with conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provision of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and conspiracy to violate the AECA and its implementing regulations, the ITAR. The FCPA charge arose out of Airbus’s scheme to offer and pay bribes to foreign officials, including Chinese officials, in order to obtain and retain business, including contracts to sell aircraft. The AECA charge stems from Airbus’s willful failure to disclose political contributions, commissions or fees to the U.S. government, as required under the ITAR, in connection with the sale or export of defense articles and defense services to the Armed Forces of a foreign country or international organization.

“Airbus SE, the second largest Aerospace company worldwide, engaged in a systematic and deliberate conspiracy, that knowingly and willfully violated U.S. fraud and export laws,” said Special Agent in Charge Peter C. Fitzhugh of HSI New York. “Airbus’s fraud and bribery in commercial aircraft transactions strengthened corrupt airlines and bad actors worldwide, at the expense of straightforward enterprises. Additionally, the bribery of government officials, specifically those involved in the procurement of U.S. military technology, posed a national security threat to both the U.S. and its allies. The global threats facing the U.S. have never been greater than they are today, and HSI New York is committed to working with our federal and international partners to assure sensitive U.S. technologies are not unlawfully and fraudulently acquired. As this investigation reflects, national security continues to be a top priority not just for Department of Homeland Security, but for HSI New York.”

“Airbus engaged in a multi-year and massive scheme to corruptly enhance its business interests by paying bribes in China and other countries and concealing those bribes,” said Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “This coordinated resolution was possible thanks to the dedicated efforts of our foreign partners at the Serious Fraud Office in the United Kingdom and the PNF in France. The Department will continue to work aggressively with our partners across the globe to root out corruption, particularly corruption that harms American interests.”

“International corruption involving sensitive U.S. defense technology presents a particularly dangerous combination. Today’s announcement demonstrates the Department’s continuing commitment to ensuring that those who violate our export control laws are held to account,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General David P. Burns of the Justice Department’s National Security Division (NSD). “The resolution, however, also reflects the significant benefits available under NSD’s revised voluntary self-disclosure policy for companies that choose to self-report export violations, cooperate, and remediate as to those violations, even where there are aggravating circumstances. We hope other companies will make the same decision as Airbus to report potential criminal export violations timely and directly to NSD so that they too can avail themselves of the policy’s benefits.”

“Today, Airbus has admitted to a years-long campaign of corruption around the world, said U.S. Attorney Jessie K. Liu of the District of Columbia. “Through bribes, Airbus allowed rampant corruption to invade the U.S. system. Additionally, Airbus falsely reported information about their conduct to the U.S. government for more than five years in order to gain valuable licenses to export U.S. military technology. This case exemplifies the ability of our prosecutors and law enforcement to work with our foreign counterparts to ensure that corruption around the world is prevented and punished at the highest levels.”

The company’s payment to the United States will be $527 million for the FCPA and ITAR violations, and an additional 50 million Euros (approximately $55 million) as part of a civil forfeiture agreement for the ITAR-related conduct, and the department will credit a portion of the amount the company pays to the Parquet National Financier (PNF) in France under the company’s agreement with the PNF. In addition, the company has agreed to pay a $10 million penalty to the U.S. Department of State’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC), of which the department is crediting $5 million. In related proceedings, the company settled with the PNF in France over bribes paid to government officials and non-governmental airline executives in China and multiple other countries and the company has agreed to pay more than 2 billion Euros (more than approximately $2.29 billion) pursuant to the PNF agreement. As part of this coordinated global resolution, the company also entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the United Kingdom’s Serious Fraud Office (SFO) over bribes paid in Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Indonesia and Ghana, and the company has agreed to pay approximately 990 million Euros equivalent (approximately $1.09 billion) pursuant to the SFO agreement. The PNF and SFO had investigated the company as part of a Joint Investigative Team.

According to admissions and court documents, beginning in at least 2008 and continuing until at least 2015, Airbus engaged in and facilitated a scheme to offer and pay bribes to decision makers and other influencers, including to foreign officials, in order to obtain improper business advantages and to win business from both privately owned enterprises and entities that were state-owned and state-controlled. In furtherance of the corrupt bribery scheme, Airbus employees and agents, among other things, sent emails while located in the United States and participated in and provided luxury travel to foreign officials within the United States.

The admissions and court documents establish that in order to conceal and to facilitate the bribery scheme, Airbus engaged certain business partners, in part, to assist in the bribery scheme. Between approximately 2013 and 2015, Airbus engaged a business partner in China and knowingly and willfully conspired to make payments to the business partner that were intended to be used as bribes to government officials in China in connection with the approval of certain agreements in China associated with the purchase and sale of Airbus aircraft to state-owned and state-controlled airlines in China. In order to conceal the payments and to conceal its engagement of the business partner in China, Airbus did not pay the business partner directly but instead made payments to a bank account in Hong Kong in the name of a company controlled by another business partner.

Pursuant to the AECA and ITAR, the DDTC regulates the export and import of U.S. defense articles and defense services, and prohibits their export overseas without the requisite licensing and approval of the DDTC. According to admissions and court documents, between December 2011 and December 2016, Airbus filed numerous applications for the export of defense articles and defense services to foreign armed forces. As part of its applications, Airbus was required under Part 130 of the ITAR to provide certain information related to political contributions, fees or commissions paid in connection with the sale of defense articles or defense services. The admissions and court documents reveal, however, that the company engaged in a criminal conspiracy to knowingly and willfully violate the AECA and ITAR, by failing to provide DDTC with accurate information related to commissions paid by Airbus to third-party brokers who were hired to solicit, promote or otherwise secure the sale of defense articles and defense services to foreign armed forces.

As part of the deferred prosecution agreement with the department, Airbus has agreed to continue to cooperate with the department in any ongoing investigations and prosecutions relating to the conduct, including of individuals, and to enhance its compliance program.

For the FCPA-related conduct, the department reached this resolution with Airbus based on a number of factors, including the company’s cooperation and remediation. In addition, for the FCPA-related conduct, the U.S. resolution recognizes the strength of France’s and the United Kingdom’s interests over the company’s corruption-related conduct, as well as the compelling equities of France and the United Kingdom to vindicate their respective interests as those countries deem appropriate, and the department has taken into account these countries’ determination of the appropriate resolution into all aspects of the U.S. resolution.

With respect to the AECA and ITAR-related conduct, the department reached this resolution with Airbus based on the voluntary and timely nature of its disclosure to the department as well as the company’s cooperation and remediation.

HSI’s New York Field Office Counter Proliferation Investigations Group is investigating the case. Deputy Chief Christopher Cestaro, Assistant Chief Vanessa Sisti and Trial Attorney Elina A. Rubin Smith of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section, Deputy Chief Elizabeth L. D. Cannon and Trial Attorney David Lim of the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section, and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Michelle Zamarin, Gregg Maisel, David Kent and Karen Seifert of the District of Columbia are prosecuting the case. The Criminal Division’s Office of International Affairs provided assistance. Significant assistance for this case was provided by France’s Parquet National Financier and the UK’s Serious Fraud Office.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.6878058314323425}",negative,0.6878058314323425,-1
"Bombardier exits the commercial plane business, sells remaining A220 stake to Airbus - CBC.ca","Fri, 14 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzL2JvbWJhcmRpZXItZmluYW5jaWFsLXJlc3VsdHMtYWlyYnVzLWMtc2VyaWVzLTEuNTQ2MjE4MtIBIGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9hbXAvMS41NDYyMTgy?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bombardier is getting out of the commercial aviation business, as the company moves to pay down its massive debt.

The Quebec-based plane and train maker said late Wednesday that it has sold its remaining stake in the A220 program — formerly known as the C Series — to Airbus.

Bombardier has been reorganizing its business in an effort to pay off a multibillion-dollar debt. It released its financial results for 2019 on Thursday. Bombardier currently has more than $9 billion US worth of debt on its books, against annual revenues of just over $15 billion.

The company posted an annual loss of $1.6 billion for the fiscal year, which is why the company is moving to sell off assets to shore up its balance sheet.

""We are looking at our options,"" CEO Alain Bellemare said. ""As you can understand, it's very sensitive.

""The reason why we're looking at strategic options is to accelerate deleveraging of the business — the strategy was always to exit commercial aircraft,"" said Bellemare, who has been CEO since 2015.

WATCH | Questions surround future of Bombardier:

Questions surround future of Bombardier Duration 1:47 The future of Bombardier may be in question after it sold off its commercial airline division, which had been previously bailed out by the Quebec government.

Under the deal, Airbus now owns 75 per cent of Bombardier's commercial aviation business. The Quebec government, which is not injecting any new money into the program, owns 25 per cent.

Airbus will pay Bombardier $591 million US for the stake. The deal means Bombardier will no longer be required to make investments of approximately $700 million US into the program.

The deal also includes a three-year guarantee of the jobs belonging to 360 people who construct the plane's cockpits at the plant in the Montreal borough of Ville Saint-Laurent. After that, they will be transferred to Mirabel, Que.

In all, Airbus said the deal secures a total of 3,300 jobs in Quebec.

Bombardier said in January that it was ""reassessing its ongoing participation"" in its partnership with Airbus to manufacture the A220.

Despite the Quebec government's $1.3-billion investment in the C Series in 2016, sales of the planes were initially slow, leading Bombardier to sell a controlling stake of the C Series program to Airbus in 2018 for $1. In the year before that deal went through, Bombardier said the commercial aviation unit was burning through more than $1 billion a year, and posted a loss of more than $400 million.

At the time, the deal included a clause that allowed Airbus to buy the entire business at ""fair market value"" within the next seven years.

Front Burner 24:06 Are taxpayer handouts over for Bombardier? Today, the Canadian company Bombardier is more than $9 billion US in debt. Over the years, it has received billions in taxpayer bailouts. But after some big failures, layoffs and criticism over executive bonuses, this time around may be different.

While A220 orders have since started rolling in, Bombardier would need to inject more money into the program to ramp up production.

Quebec Premier François Legault has ruled out investing more government money in the A220 program, but Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon said that he wants to protect Quebec's investment in the plane.

Bombardier is paring itself down significantly, and will now focus on business jets and trains. (Scott Galley/CBC)

The company has made a slew of moves recently to refocus on its core business, the definition of which has become something of a moving target.

In 2018, the company sold its Q Series turboprop business to Longview Aviation.

Then about a year ago, Bombardier sold plane-making factories in Belfast, Northern Ireland and Morocco and streamlined its various private jet brands including Global, Challenger, Learjet and the CRJ into one company.

It later sold part of that business, CRJ, to Mitsubishi in the summer of 2019. The remaining private jet business appears to be the core of what's left at the company.

On Wednesday, French media reported that Alstom was preparing to finalize an offer to acquire Bombardier Transportation, which includes the business of making rail and subway cars.

""They have cashed out of the C series,"" analyst Alexander Robert Medd of Bucephalus Research said of the company on Thursday, ""and now it appears the train business is up for sale. Alstom may be the only bidder.""

As recently as last week, the company was in talks with the Rhode Island-based Textron — which owns Cessna and Bell Helicopters — regarding the sale of its remaining business jet division.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.91231769323349}",neutral,0.91231769323349,0
"Triple Threat Jet? This New Widebody Airbus Promises Lower Emissions, Greater Range and More Room Inside - Robb Report","Tue, 18 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbW90b3JzL2F2aWF0aW9uL2FpcmJ1cy1uZXctYWNqMzIwbmVvLWpldC1kZXRhaWxzLTI4OTg2ODgv0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly9yb2JicmVwb3J0LmNvbS9tb3RvcnMvYXZpYXRpb24vYWlyYnVzLW5ldy1hY2ozMjBuZW8tamV0LWRldGFpbHMtMjg5ODY4OC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Business aviation’s efforts to have jets fly farther while reducing their carbon footprint has been given a lift with the new Airbus ACJ320neo. The “neo” differentiator stands for “new engine option” and gives clients a choice between next-generation CFM LEAP-1A or Pratt & Whitney PW1100G engines.

London-based Acropolis Aviation took delivery of the first ACJ320neo and, as of press time, planned to enter it in service in February. The charter company selected LEAP-1A engines due to their sustainability—they offer a 15 percent improvement in fuel efficiency and cut CO2 emissions by the same percentage, all while being quieter than the previous generation.

The heightened efficiency of the engines extends the ACJ320neo’s range by 1,700 nautical miles, giving it a full distance of 6,000 nautical miles. This allows the jet to travel 13 hours nonstop, more time than is required to fly from Los Angeles to Moscow or London to Beijing.

Because the widebody airframe is the same as that of Airbus’s commercial aircraft, the ACJ320neo is 65 percent wider than a typical business jet and, with domed ceilings, has 20 percent more cabin height. That translates to three times more cabin space than its competitors have.

The extra room also gave ACJ designers freedom to create interior concepts such as the Melody, with its light-colored styling and soft curves inspired by nature. The design flows from the master bedroom at the rear to a spacious lounge at the front. The Infinito concept, by Italian supercar builder Pagani, is even more adventurous. It presents a clear ceiling—running the length of the cabin—that projects an image of open sky. Pagani used many of the same materials as it would on its Huayra hypercar, with soft-leather carpets and carbon fiber in the furniture and wall frames.

For the 19-passenger Acropolis aircraft, however, celebrated design agency Alberto Pinto created an open-plan forward lounge, a mid-cabin conference and dining room and, at the back, an en suite master bedroom that includes the first large rectangular shower installed in an ACJ. After all, cleaner flying can take many forms.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7651451826095581}",neutral,0.7651451826095581,0

The case shows that, once again, bribery of foreign officials in the public and private sectors was part of a major multinational corporation’s business model. French prosecutors said the violations they uncovered increased Airbus’s profits by one billion Euros.

Record-breaking as the fines may be, going after the company alone is not a sufficient deterrent. The plea agreement should be followed by prosecution of the executives involved.

Notably absent in the Airbus agreements are any plans to share the penalty payment with the countries where the company was paying bribes, including Colombia, Ghana, Indonesia and Sri Lanka.

Foreign bribery, especially on this scale, has a pernicious and devastating effect on the countries where the bribes are paid – the so-called ‘demand side’ of the bribery equation. Governments pay higher prices for lower quality or incomplete goods and services. They may even waste millions on completely unnecessary procurements. Essential services like education and healthcare are deprived of much needed funds as a result.

MVRDV and airbus envision flying vehicles that collect passengers from their balconies - Designboom,"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlc2lnbmJvb20uY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvbXZyZHYtYWlyYnVzLWFpci1tb2JpbGl0eS1mbHlpbmctdmVoaWNsZXMtdXJiYW4tZW52aXJvbm1lbnRzLTAyLTI4LTIwMjAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MVRDV has collaborated with airbus, bauhaus luftfahrt, ETH zurich, and systra, to develop a plan for the future of urban air mobility (UAM). the investigation tackles the integration of ‘flying vehicles’ into our urban environments and envisions a comprehensive mobility concept.

over the last two years, MVRDV has supported airbus in exploring strategic urban development scenarios that leverage UAM as an opportunity to grow cities around the globe into thriving urban regions. together they have produced a study aimed to avoid any detrimental impacts from this disruptive technology, which can so easily arise when truly revolutionary transport modes are introduced to cities without careful planning for both short-term and long-term scenarios.

the research highlights how, when implemented with urban principles in mind, UAM can reconnect territories with minimal impact, and deliver a multi-modal system that is accessible to, and beneficial for, people of all backgrounds. according to their report, the key to unlocking this potential lies largely in vertiports, landing hubs that integrate the aerial network with the existing and future ground transportation system.

the research envisages vertiports of various types and sizes, just like traditional transport stops, stations, and terminals. however, unlike stations for other urban transport options such as trains, metros, or buses, the network does not require any linear infrastructure in between. no tracks, tunnels or roads are required, saving energy, natural resources, and land.

this allows designers to adapt the vertiports to a variety of different locations, plugging into and enhancing existing urban scenarios with a number of different configurations. the report describes them as ‘catalysts for urban improvement’ thought of not just as stations, but also as hubs of renewable energy, data, and public amenities, that can scale while remaining sustainable and resilient. air transport incentivizes an ecologically responsible contribution to the local smart grids of energy and data.

the research also considered the principles of transit-oriented development, not only by bringing airborne transport links, but also by integrating with other multimodal transport options to serve local surroundings and solve the problem of the ‘last mile’. in locations that are underdeveloped, vertiports can be designed as opportunity hubs with educational and healthcare facilities, or business incubators, for example, while in areas fractured by infrastructure such as roads or railway tracks, a vertiport can serve as a bridge connecting neighbourhoods.

‘as cities become denser and technologies improve, it becomes increasingly clear that the truly three-dimensional city – one that includes flying vehicles – is surely one of the city models of the future… a city where my mobility is at my balcony!’ says winy maas, founding partner of MVRDV. ‘but to reach this future will require many small steps. it’s a credit to airbus that they are thinking about these issues in advance, and doing so in a way that will improve things in the meantime.’

on a broader scale, the research investigates the potential of future UAM networks within cities recognising that UAM should not seek to replace cities’ existing transport infrastructure. it acknowledges the short-term business case for UAM as a service that connects major transportation hubs such as airports with business centres. however, it also looks towards a more mature stage in the technology’s implementation concluding that once UAM is well established with an extensive network of vertiports, it could serve as an interesting contributor to a mobility system of discrete and distributed modes that complement rail or road infrastructure.

a mature network of vertiports could serve to connect disadvantaged areas of cities and remote areas without the need for expensive infrastructure; could vastly improve emergency response times; and could even allow ‘technological leapfrogging’ in developing countries, providing a transit network that is relatively inexpensive to create in cities that never developed extensive metro or tram systems. together these benefits can give cities the accessibility that is needed to attract new economic opportunities.

MVRDV and airbus have developed a number of scenarios based on cities around the world, to showcase how vertiports could be integrated into a variety of urban situations. an immersive exhibition titled the city and the sky above, created through a collaboration between MVRDV, airbus, and squint/opera is currently on display at the bi-city biennale of urbanism\architecture giving a glimpse into a future world that masters these ideas.

Airbus wants to change the shape of commercial flights - CNET,"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3RlY2gvdGVjaC1pbmR1c3RyeS9haXJidXMtd2FudHMtdG8tY2hhbmdlLXRoZS1zaGFwZS1vZi1jb21tZXJjaWFsLWZsaWdodHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Since the start of commercial flight, the basic shape of an airplane hasn't changed radically. Take a long tube, stick on a pair of wings, add a tail assembly and you pretty much have an airplane. Yes, aeronautical design is a bit more complicated than that, and a Boeing 747 barely resembles a Douglas DC-3, but anyone would instantly recognize either one as an airplane.

But one day there's a chance, albeit a small one, you may soar through the sky in a much different shape. At the Singapore Airshow on Tuesday, Airbus publicly revealed a blended-wing aircraft design it says could end up in passenger service.

A view from above shows the MAVERIC's unique shape. Airbus

Called MAVERIC (a much shorter way of saying Model Aircraft for Validation and Experimentation of Robust Innovative Controls), the aircraft is a pilotless demonstrator that's just 2 meters long and 3.2 meters wide. Though the aircraft has been in testing since June, Airbus has largely kept it under wraps until now.

Though similar to flying-wing aircraft like the Stealth Bomber, blended-wing aircraft have a shape where the fuselage and wing blend together without a clear dividing line between the two. In contrast, a flying-wing aircraft has no discernible fuselage at all.

Watch this: On the road with an Airbus A380 01:06

The potential advantages of a blended-wing aircraft include a stronger structure, a lighter aircraft weight and quieter engines. Also, less drag from the blended shape would mean better fuel efficiency.

For passengers, Airbus says a cabin more like a large room than a tube would bring an ""exceptionally comfortable cabin layout, enabling passengers to benefit from additional legroom and larger aisles for more personal comfort."" Yeah, we heard grand promises like that when the 747 and Airbus A380 debuted, but airlines just crammed in more seats instead. Airbus also would have to convince passengers to sit in an airplane without conventional windows.

The MAVERIC's wide cabin could resemble more of a theater than a conventional airliner. Airbus

In any case, it'll be a long time if you ever fly in a life-sized MAVERIC, if you do so at all. Flight testing of the demonstrator will continue through this year and Airbus hasn't said when it could build a MAVERIC that would be flown by human crews.

Boeing has built blended-wing aircraft, as well. Developed in partnership with NASA, the X-48 was a pilotless aircraft that flew test missions between August 2012 and April 2013. Since then, the two have continued to develop blended-wing technology. And last year, Dutch airline KLM said it's partnering with Delft University of Technology to develop a ""Flying-V"" blended-wing plane.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7336699366569519}",positive,0.7336699366569519,1
Airbus Advances Autonomy Project As Part Of Future-Cockpit Concept - Aviation Week,"Fri, 21 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9hZXJvc3BhY2UvcHJvZ3JhbS1tYW5hZ2VtZW50L2FpcmJ1cy1hZHZhbmNlcy1hdXRvbm9teS1wcm9qZWN0LXBhcnQtZnV0dXJlLWNvY2twaXQtY29uY2VwdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The autonomous taxi, takeoff-and-landing (ATTOL) project is the first visible part of Airbus’ work on a so-called fifth-generation flight deck, which is aimed at improving safety by allowing a crew more time for decision-making. As part of the project, a modified A350-1000 performed eight automated takeoffs in December in Toulouse, using an image-recognition system. Landing trials followed in mid-January.

Airbus flight safety experts see the main goal for the design of a fifth-generation cockpit as enabling the pilot to become a mission manager. Information should be presented more synthetically, says Pascal Traverse, Airbus’ general manager of autonomy technology. Typically, a primary flight display with parameters such as a speed scale could disappear for most of the flight.

Takeoff and landing tests successfully used image recognition

Fifth-generation cockpit nearing the drawing board

The electronic centralized aircraft monitor (ECAM, also known as the engine-indicating and crew-alerting system) usually recommends remedial actions. “Instead of telling the crew to shut down a pump, the ECAM would shut it down itself,” Traverse says.

In a fifth-generation cockpit, the autopilot would be key. It would have more capabilities—such as coping with wind gusts—and therefore can be engaged throughout the flight. It would become even more reliable thanks to increased computer redundancy, Traverse explains.

Enhancing the autopilot would allow an existing trend to continue. The A350 includes the latest progress in autopilot technology, as it remains engaged even though flight-envelope protection becomes active. Moreover, the speed brakes automatically extend after the aircraft surpasses 5 kt. above maximum operating speed.

In the fifth-generation cockpit, the size of the crew no longer would be a factor of safety, according to Traverse. A long-haul flight would need two pilots instead of three, but “reducing the size of the crew is not an objective,” he says.

The ATTOL system is intended to give the crew more time and bandwidth to analyze a situation, regardless of the airport’s landing aids. It would enable the aircraft to land automatically, while the crew looks at the situation as a whole.

“Airbus commercial aircraft use 4,000 airports, 1,000 of which have an instrument landing system [ILS], and only a few hundred runways are compatible with our autoland capacity,” says Sebastien Giuliano, ATTOL project manager.

In 2013, in Birmingham, Alabama, a UPS-operated Airbus A300 freighter crashed, killing both crewmembers. The ILS was unavailable. The crew failed to properly configure the flight management computer and monitor the aircraft’s altitude, the NTSB investigation found.

Satellite-based guidance does not allow autolanding, but it can be seen as an alternative to ILS. However, loss of the signal from a global navigation satellite system is reported regularly.

With computer vision, the aircraft would no longer depend on an external system, Giuliano emphasizes.

The ATTOL project was launched in June 2018 for a duration of two years by Airbus UpNext, an organization that also manages the E-Fan X hybrid-electric demonstrator and Fello’fly project for fuel-efficient formation flight. One aim of the ATTOL system is to exploit the possibilities of image recognition when the system is close to the ground.

At the heart of ATTOL are a camera (mounted on top of the instrument panel and looking forward), image-processing algorithms and a control law. The system detects converging vanishing lines and deduces the runway’s centerline.

The December flight test began with a deliberate 4-m (13-ft.) offset position before the brakes were released. The aircraft autonomously reached the centerline while accelerating. In a video released by Airbus, the copilot can be heard saying, “It is converging . . . overshooting . . . coming back on it.”

At the preset speed, the control law took care of the rotation, and the autopilot took over with an existing mode, says Giuliano.

For the landing tests, the crew aligned the aircraft with the centerline in approach and then cut off GPS and ILS receivers. The aircraft landed autonomously, using visual cues. Two runways were used for the five landings, meaning the system adapted to different visual environments.

During deceleration, the system realigned the aircraft when required. The fifth landing involved the brake-to-vacate system, which regulates deceleration so the aircraft reaches the chosen exit at the correct speed. Coupling the two systems was deemed successful.

Could fog be a limitation? The ATTOL system could use sensors outside the visible spectrum, Giuliano answers. The resulting “image” would not have to be seen by a human eye and therefore could be analyzed directly by a software program.

Another limitation—sunlight dazzling the camera—has been overcome by using the camera that monitors the main landing gear, which is under the nose section and oriented rearward, shielding it from the Sun and enabling it to follow the runway’s centerline, Giuliano explains. It can be used for every takeoff after rotation, once the cockpit camera is pointing at the sky and not the runway.

Although no product development has begun, a certification challenge can be foreseen because some algorithms use machine learning (ML). The European Union Aviation Safety Agency recently released the first edition of its “Artificial Intelligence Roadmap,” which begins to answer OEMs’ questions on how to certify an ML-based system.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9991975426673889}",neutral,0.9991975426673889,0
Airbus and CAAS collaborate to enable urban air mobility - Airbus,"Wed, 12 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMC0wMi1haXJidXMtYW5kLWNhYXMtY29sbGFib3JhdGUtdG8tZW5hYmxlLXVyYmFuLWFpci1tb2JpbGl0edIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Singapore, 12 February 2020 – Airbus and the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to enable urban air mobility (UAM) in Singapore.

The MOU was signed today at the Singapore Airshow 2020 between Jean-Brice Dumont, Executive Vice-President, Engineering, Airbus and Kevin Shum, Director-General of CAAS.

The collaboration aims to bring UAM services and platforms to reality in Singapore’s urban environment, with the target to enhance industry productivity and improve the country’s regional connectivity. As part of the agreement:

· Airbus and CAAS will collaborate to define and develop an initial UAM service with an Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS). The parties will specifically work together to realise the Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) system and services to support the initial use-case.



· For such UAM operations, both parties will co-operate on fostering public acceptance, developing standards, and establishing necessary safety frameworks.



· Finally, Airbus and CAAS will study the feasibility and requirements for further UAM services that include leading-edge cargo and passenger transportation solutions.



This MOU advances a longstanding partnership between Airbus and CAAS. An earlier collaboration was first established in 2016 for UAS proof-of-concept trials (“Skyways”). Airbus and CAAS subsequently signed an agreement with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency to share and advance the development of operational and safety standards for UAS in urban environments.



Skyways started as an experimental project aimed at developing safe unmanned air delivery systems for use in dense urban environments. The proof-of-concept trials for Skyways were successfully completed in 2019 with the delivery of parcels in the campus of the National University of Singapore, and deliveries of 3D-printed parts and consumables to vessels anchored at Singapore’s Eastern Working Anchorage.

Going forward, the Skyways UAS will be used as a flying test lab to continue testing technologies and concepts, focusing initially on connectivity and navigation, which are essential elements for UTM. UTM is a key enabler for Airbus’ vision for urban mobility, and is paving the way for digital traffic management solutions. It will be a critical component to allow new aircraft, such as air taxis and UAS, to enter and share the skies safely.



“CAAS supports the beneficial development of UAM. It fits within our Smart Nation vision, where we aim to take full advantage of technology to solve problems, address challenges, and develop Singapore into one of the most outstanding cities in the world to live in. That is why we seek to collaborate with businesses to push the boundaries of their applications. Such collaborations, including our longstanding CAAS-Airbus partnership, build Singapore’s capabilities and expertise to enable advanced UA applications, particularly in our urban environment,” said Shum.

Dumont noted at the occasion: “Airbus is constantly seeking ways to drive new frontiers in air mobility. We are excited to take the next step with our long-standing partner CAAS, with a shared vision of developing urban air mobility and the supporting UTM systems and services to bring a safe and reliable transportation solution to people.”

The European Space Agency (ESA) mission will study the Sun to improve our understanding of how it creates the heliosphere, the vast bubble surrounding the solar system. The satellite has 10 in-situ and remote sensing instruments, used to take photographs and spectra, and collect data on solar particles, the solar wind, solar flares and the Sun’s magnetic field.

Ian Walters, Airbus’ programme manager for Solar Orbiter said: “Today’s launch is a fantastic success for all the teams across Europe and America who have made this mission happen. We now look forward to the exciting discoveries that Solar Orbiter will make as it looks directly at the Sun.”

Solar Orbiter will use gravity assist manoeuvres around Venus, to achieve its elliptical operational orbit, approaching the Sun as close as 42 million km.

With the UK built satellite orbiting at such close distances it will have to endure temperatures exceeding 500°C, hot enough to melt lead. Its unique heat shield covered in a special heat-emitting coating called SolarBlack will protect the spacecraft behind the shield from the extreme heat of the Sun at this close distance.

ESA selected Airbus in Stevenage to design and build the satellite which began in 2012, and the mission is expected to have a lifetime of up to 10 years.

"Airbus Reveals Their ""Blended Wing Body"" Concept Plane; What Will the Interior be Like? - Core77.com","Tue, 11 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvcmU3Ny5jb20vcG9zdHMvOTM5NTgvQWlyYnVzLVJldmVhbHMtVGhlaXItQmxlbmRlZC1XaW5nLUJvZHktQ29uY2VwdC1QbGFuZS1XaGF0LVdpbGwtdGhlLUludGVyaW9yLWJlLUxpa2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Just yesterday we were musing about how passengers would sit in a flying wing airplane. Today Airbus revealed their take on the concept, a ""blended wing"" aircraft that's sort of shaped like an apple turnover.







As with KLM's concept, Airbus' MAVERIC (""Model Aircraft for Validation and Experimentation of Robust Innovative Controls"") is going to require a massive re-think of the passenger experience. As Reuters reports:

""Airbus is now studying how the cabin would work and how the aircraft would be integrated into airports. One unresolved question is whether such a plane would have windows or use video screens to give passengers a sense of their surroundings.""

""Another issue that has dogged such experiments in the past is how to handle sensations of movement. Because passengers would be sitting further out from the center of the aircraft, compared to the classic 'tube and wings' model, they would move further when the aircraft turns.""







Although Airbus has released three renderings of the interior, it's not exactly clear how these rows would be integrated into the delta shape of the aircraft. It appears that the space is generally rectangular rather than following the outside form of the craft:

As it turns out, the question of how to design an interior layout for a delta-shaped airplane was addressed, if not solved, in the 1940s and '50s:

""Mockup of luxurious 80-passenger cabin in the Northrop 6 jet flying wing 'airliner of the future' from a 1948 Popular Science promo film. It was a proposed civilian use of the YB-49 which was headed for cancellation."" (Source)

""A cutaway illustration shows the interior of a proposed flying wing commercial airliner developed by Northrop in 1951 from the commercial passenger variant of the YB-49/YB-35 flying wings."" (Source)





""There were promises that planes like Northrop Grumman's flying wing would become the norm for civilian flying. These promises were often made to Baby Boomers — young, impressionable kids of the 1950s and 60s — like in this cutaway drawing by L. Ashwell Wood for the comic book Eagle."" (Source)

The latter two drawings appear to feature train-like cabins, with sleepers on the right. This would be an interesting option for long-haul flights, though I imagine none of us regular people would be able to afford the ticket.

By the bye, here's the actual video referenced above:

Airbus Unveils Blended Wing Body Demonstrator - Aviation Week,"Tue, 11 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L2FpcmJ1cy11bnZlaWxzLWJsZW5kZWQtd2luZy1ib2R5LWRlbW9uc3RyYXRvctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Singapore - As it becomes clearer that disruptive new airliner configurations will be one of the few ways of meeting the reduced emissions targets of the future, Airbus has revealed it is flight-testing a scaled blended wing body (BWB) technology demonstrator.

The BWB flying wing configuration, originally conceived by McDonnell Douglas in the 1990s prior to its acquisition by Boeing, offers potential operating efficiency improvements because lift can be generated across the fuselage. Additional benefits include reduced form drag and greater space above the wing for more efficient higher bypass engines or other propulsion systems.

Dubbed the Maveric (model aircraft for validation and experimentation of robust innovative controls), the Airbus demonstrator is 6.5 ft. long with a 10.5 ft-span wing. Powered by twin podded model aircraft turbine engines mounted above the aft deck of the 24.2 sq. ft area wing, the aircraft first flew in June 2019 at an undisclosed location in central France. Maveric is still being flight tested says Jean-Brice Dumont, executive vice president of engineering for Airbus.

Designed specifically to evaluate flight control systems adapted for delta wing designs, the flight tests will be followed by a second round of studies to evaluate wider aspects of the configuration including safety, manufacturability, airport compatibility, maintenance and support. “Let’s be clear we are studying this as an option,” says Dumont. “We have already learned a lot and tests have helped us understand the flight behaviour of this kind of configuration in a real flight condition. So far we have a green light which is why are unveiling it, and we are continuing with a more extensive study.”

Airbus believes an initial single-aisle sized BWB could potentially provide up to 20% lower fuel burn than current tube-and-wing designs. Although Boeing, and latterly Lockheed Martin, have targeted blended designs at military and cargo roles after more than two decades of research, Airbus says recent technology advances could make it more attractive in the near to mid-term. “What makes us wish to revive the BWB now? Some technologies have improved; we can make the aircraft lighter and our flight controls and computing capabilities are one level higher. That means we can face the challenges at least a level higher than before.”

However, Dumont says the real driver is the environmental concerns facing the industry. “The pressure we are under and the fact we need to disrupt to reach emissions objectives in 2050 forces us to drive down avenues we wouldn’t have gone down earlier. That’s because the equation was not resolvable and now we believe it is.” Dumont adds BWB configurations are also particularly attractive because they can more easily support non-conventional hybrid electric and, perhaps ultimately, all-electric propulsion systems.

Airbus says the Maveric forms part of a broader group of advanced technology studies which will help guide potential future product development. Some of these projects, including the EcoPulse distributed propulsion demonstrator unveiled last year, will influence decisions on which technology may be tested in a larger scale demonstrator. “To take this concept further we will need to fly a ‘Scale 1’ or larger demonstrator, but before that, we must answer questions about airport interface issues and the propulsion system,” says Dumont.

“What’s the best fit for the BWB? Right now we have two podded engines but is it the right formula? In parallel, we are testing the EcoPulse with Daher and Safran in France which is teaching us quickly about flight controls and power controls for distributed propulsion. So, we are converging this into a potential product. I’d say the next step would be flying this at a larger scale, but at exactly what scale and when I don’t know.”

Under the EcoPulse project Daher, Airbus and Safran plan to fly a modified TBM 900 turboprop as a distributed propulsion demonstrator by mid-2022. Although the aircraft will retain its standard nose-section engine and propeller the TBM will be modified with three small propellers on each wing. Each will be driven by a 45-kW Safran ENGINeUS electric motor, fed by batteries or an APU. Airbus is contributing battery technology and aerodynamic modelling.

One key question is whether the generally windowless cabin of a BWB can be made attractive to passengers. Boeing’s long-running BWB studies, some of which were conducted with NASA under the X-48 project, focused mostly on flight characteristics but also included many potential passenger and cargo configuration evaluations. The majority of these favoured freight over passenger roles due to issues associated with passenger acceptance and safety concerns, but Airbus believes technology concepts that include virtual screens for situational awareness could make BWBs acceptable to the traveling public.

“We need to come with disruptive options and enter service at the earliest possible date to bring benefits by 2050. The clock is ticking,” says Dumont.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9954984188079834}",positive,0.9954984188079834,1
"Airbus buys Bombardier’s share in A220, now sole owner together with the Government of Quebec - Leeham News and Analysis","Thu, 13 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMC8wMi8xMy9haXJidXMtYnV5cy1ib21iYXJkaWVycy1zaGFyZS1pbi1hMjIwLW5vdy1zb2xlLW93bmVyLXRvZ2V0aGVyLXdpdGgtdGhlLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtb2YtcXVlYmVjL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Bjorn Fehrm

February 13, 2020, © Leeham News in Toulouse: The news this morning that Airbus is now the sole owner of the A220 (75%) together with the Government of Quebec (25%) is good news for the A220 and for Quebec.

Bombardier is a company in trouble and it was forced to try and save cash in the A220 partnership rather than invest in the future. This potential limitation on the A220 program is now resolved. Airbus gets sole responsibility for future plans and it has in the Government of Quebec a partner that will be positive to the growth of the A220 as it means more business for the Quebec aeronautical industry.

A220, a program with a troubled past morph to a program with a promising future

The A220 joint venture was set up with Airbus as the majority owner with 50.01% and Bombardier as a minority partner with 30.9%, the Government of Quebec, which invested $1bn in the program in 2016, held a 19% share.

The Bombardier commitment also contained a program loss coverage of a maximum of $610m until 2021. This loss coverage, though capped, was problematic for cash-strapped Bombardier. Bombardier needs cash to pay off its large debts (to a large extent caused by A220 development costs) rather than spending more money on an A220 that needed investment at its cash-eating production ramp phase.

Airbus today said the A220 will be profitable when the production reaches 150 aircraft per year which, is expected around 2025. Given the burden of the learning curve of a commercial aircraft program, the total cost of launching a new airliner into the market is approximately double the development cost of about $6bn in the case of the A220.

Airbus is a company with a strong balance sheet and Bombardier the reverse, it has a weak balance sheet. This is no good situation in a JV where Airbus’ sales team and its customers realize the potential of the A220 and are prepared to invest to reap the benefits of the program. Latest today a new MOU for 50 A220 to the African carrier, Green Africa, was announced at the Singapore Air show.

Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said in today’s 2019 year results press conference, “The A220 program is one we want to invest in, it’s a program we believe in.” This underlines the Airbus attitude towards the A220.

With the transfer of the A220 program to Airbus, the program got a parent with the stature and sales force to exploit the potential of the aircraft. Having Bombardier leave the program, which naturally had different objectives/priorities was in the end, a positive.

The Government of Quebec increases its share in the program from 19% to 25%. This happens without further investment. For the Quebec Government to be a supporter of the program and having transparency on business decisions and investments in the Quebec aero industry is positive.

Airbus will also absorb the remaining Bombardier production parts for the A220. Bombardier sold its wing making North Ireland plant to Spirit Aerosystems last year, but is still making the forward fuselage including the cockpit and the aft fuselage at its St Laurent plant in downtown Montreal.

Airbus will now take over this production and organize it in the Airbus structure subsidiary Stelia Aerospace. The production will initially remain in St Laurent but eventually move to the area of the A220 FAL in Mirabel, north-west of Montreal, to there form an integrated production site for the A220.

Summary:

The winners and losers of this situation are clear. Bombardier took the risk of entering a new plane in the 100 to 150 seat market, with the potential to extend this to 170 seats and then handed the result to Airbus just when it became clear the program had real potential.

The big winners in the CSeries/A220 drama are Airbus and the state of Quebec. The $591m Airbus has agreed to pay for the remaining shares (it paid $1 for the initial 50%) does little to cover the estimated $8bn to $9bn losses of the program to date for Bombardier. Quebec could save all the jobs and will likely grow its aeronautical cluster further.

The stakes are high in the civil airliner business. Don’t enter it unless you have the depth of pocket to see your program through to profitability.

Airbus Explores Future Technologies - Aviation Week,"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9zaG93bmV3cy9zaW5nYXBvcmUtYWlyc2hvdy9haXJidXMtZXhwbG9yZXMtZnV0dXJlLXRlY2hub2xvZ2llc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Five decades ago, Airbus played the advanced technology trump card to enter the commercial airliner business. Now the company is playing that card again, though this time for very different reasons.

In the new era of “flight shaming” and increasing environmental pressures, Airbus believes sustainable growth is equally as important as product development and market share. As a result, the company that introduced civil aviation innovations such as fly-by-wire, composite primary structures and the two-crew flight deck is now turning to a new raft of greener aerospace technologies – some of which will be on display at the Singapore Airshow.

Ranging from advanced new aircraft concepts and hybrid electric power demonstrators to zero-emission electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) designs and delivery drones, the broad scope of the innovations on show illustrates the company’s holistic approach to the problem. The effort is led by Airbus chief technology officer Grazia Vittadini who in 2019 said, “My dream is to have Greta Thunberg [the Swedish teenage climate activist] step onto a zero-emissions Airbus aircraft.”

As part of the drive, Airbus and Rolls-Royce have begun modifying a BAe Systems RJ100 airliner into a flying hybrid-electric demonstrator under the E-Fan X program. The 2.5-MW generator, which will be part of the largest electrical power system yet to take flight, was run for the first time in August at Rolls-Royce Electrical Norway’s Trondheim facility. The unit will be integrated with a Rolls-Royce AE2100 turboprop from a Saab 2000, which will be mounted in the rear fuselage of the RJ100.

The complete turbo-generator will provide electricity to a battery pack mounted under the cabin floor and a Siemens SP2000 electric motor that replaces one of the aircraft’s four Honeywell LF507 turbofans. The motor will power a fan from a Rolls AE 3007 mounted in an inboard nacelle.

Airbus is responsible for the overall integration of the hybrid-electric propulsion system into the aircraft and the system’s lithium-ion battery pack as well as the 3-kV AC/DC distribution network, harnesses and power distribution center. Airbus and Rolls are collectively responsible for thermal management and the control architecture.

Studies of a new generation of zero-emissions eVTOL aircraft meanwhile continue for the emerging urban air mobility (UAM) market. In 2018 these became more formalized when the company grouped its experimental eVTOL work with other urban mobility projects, including the Skyways delivery drone and Voom on-demand helicopter service.

Under the new Airbus Urban Mobility unit, the company is using data from flight tests of the demonstrators to plan its next moves in the sector.

Airbus Helicopter’s ducted-rotor, four-seater CityAirbus electric UAM demonstrator continues flight tests in Germany while the company’s single-seat Vahana autonomous eVTOL concept vehicle, developed by Airbus’ Silicon Valley outpost, A3, completed its flight test program in November. Powered by batteries, the tilt-wing Vahana achieved speeds up to 100 kt. and made a flight lasting 20 min. and spanning a range of 27 nm.

Drone development also continues to accelerate, particularly in Singapore, where recent shore-to-ship delivery trials have been performed with a 4-kg-payload Skyways vehicle. Tests of the drone, which navigated autonomously along predetermined aerial corridors to vessels up to 3 km from the coast, form part of a wider program with the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and Wilhelmsen Ships Service, an international maritime logistics company. Airbus Skyways says the automated system saves up to 90% in delivery costs and up to six times higher delivery speeds than with boats.

Further off into the future Airbus is also exploring new and sometimes radical configurations that make the most of advanced propulsion systems and aerodynamic efficiency. The company is keeping one such new concept demonstrator, a blended-wing vehicle dubbed the Maveric, under wraps for now but all will be unveiled at the show tomorrow.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.98146653175354}",neutral,0.98146653175354,0
Airbus 2019: an operationally good year hit by compliance costs - Leeham News and Analysis,"Thu, 13 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMC8wMi8xMy9haXJidXMtMjAxOS1hbi1vcGVyYXRpb25hbGx5LWdvb2QteWVhci1oaXQtYnktY29tcGxpYW5jZS1jb3N0cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"February 13, 2020, © Leeham News in Toulouse: Airbus presented its results for 2019 today in Toulouse. Operationally, the company made a profit of €6.9bn but heavy fines (-€3.6bn) to settle a long-running bribery case and contingencies for A400M development cost coverage brought the net result to a loss of €1.3bn.

The Commercial aircraft division delivered 8% more aircraft 2019 (863 units vs. 800 2018). The mix of aircraft changed towards higher-margin single-aisle types like A321neo and A321LR whereas widebody margins peaked during 2019. The helicopter business is flat in a tough market and the profits of the Defense and Space division declined 40% on flat revenues.

Group-level results

Revenue for 2019 was €70.5bn (€63.7bn 2018), operating profit was €6.9bn (€5.8bn) and net profit was -€1.4bn (€5.8bn) after group write-downs of €5.6bn and financial instruments reevaluations of €2.7bn. Free cash flow for 2019 was €3.5bn (€3.5bn) and the cash position end 2019 was €12.5bn (€13.3bn).

Airbus proposes a dividend for 2019 of €1.80/share (+9% vs. 2018) but no shares buyback program.

Guidance for 2020 is:

Airbus targets around 880 commercial aircraft deliveries for 2020.

Airbus expects to deliver an EBIT Adjusted of approximately €7.5 bn

FCF before M&A and Customer Financing of approximately €4 bn before: €-3.6bn for the penalty payments and a negative mid to high triple-digit million Euro amount for the consumption of compliance-related provisions for tax and legal disputes



Commercial aircraft

The single-aisle family of A320/A321 now represents 75% of the Commercial aircraft division’s deliveries. The A320 family delivers sold margins and the A320neo, A321neo, and A321LR claim premium margins. Unfortunately for Airbus, it can’t expand significantly on this success story as the range is now sold out until 2025.

Airbus has probed its supply chain what it can support in delivery rate going forward and it can expand the present 62/month to 63 in 2021, then to 64 to 65 in 2022 and 65 to 67 in 2023. When A320/321 deliveries can’t satisfy customer demand it will try to point customers to the A220 line where there are still delivery slots available.

The above is also the reason why Airbus can’t gain from the Boeing 737 MAX crisis; it can’t make up for any MAX customer delivery shortfalls. “We have to make sure we can serve our own customers, this is tough enough,” says Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury.

The A321neo now represents 50% of Airbus deliveries going forward and the many ACF variants delivered to new customers (meaning many new “heads of version” for the new ACF three-door pair variant) meant Airbus presently has a six-month delay in deliveries of A320 aircraft.

These problems shall now be under control after a good second half 2019 for the A321 ACF variant and Airbus expects to be back on its customer delivery schedule within 18 months.

The A220 is gaining traction inside Airbus, as this is a single-aisle line that is not sold out. After buying out Bombardier effective today and controlling a 75% stake in the program with the Government of Quebec as a 25% partner, the focus is now on the delivery ramp and cost down. The program will exit its cash eating initial learning curve by 2025 when deliveries shall be 150 to 160 aircraft per year.

Airbus started making a profit on A350s delivered since the end of 2019 and the program is now running without supplier problems. Widebody demand, in general, has softened and Airbus has decided to keep A350 deliveries at the present rate of 9 to 10 a month for the next years.

It will reduce A330 deliveries from 53 in 2019 to a planned 40 for 2020. In reality, this is a modest reduction in delivery rate as some of the 2019 aircraft were readied in 2018 but lacked engines pushed them to 2019 delivery.

Airbus thinks a delivery rate ~110 A350 (113 in 2019) and ~40 A330neo is the right level for years to come in a widebody market that has weakened.

The A380 is now at its end of production with the last wing set delivered from Broughton. The load on the result will be less than $200m (-€202m in 2019) in 2020 and will decline for subsequent years.

Helicopters

The helicopter market is still soft. With a focus on services, the revenue (€6bn) and profit level (€0.4bn) have been flat between 2018 and 2019.

Defense and Space

This is now the problem child of Airbus. The satellite business has projects which are not closing and the military projects have not picked up. Revenue was flat (€10.9bn) with profits declining 40% (0.6bn).

The cost coverage for the A400M development that was expected from export orders during the time frame of the present multinational OCCAR program was put to zero in a review of the program. This resulted in an additional write-down of €1.2bn for an already troubled program. Losses going forward are estimated to stay at the €0.5bn level for 2020 to 2022 whereafter they shall gradually disappear.

"Airbus, citing weak space market, to cut more than 2300 jobs - SpaceNews","Thu, 20 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXJidXMtY2l0aW5nLXdlYWstc3BhY2UtbWFya2V0LXRvLWN1dC1tb3JlLXRoYW4tMjMwMC1qb2JzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — Airbus Defence and Space plans to shed about 7% of its workforce because of weak sales, Airbus Group said Feb. 19.

The company said it will cut 2,362 positions, citing “lower performance in space” and as a key reason for the layoffs.

Airbus Defence and Space builds satellites and rocket hardware, along with drones and military aircraft, but Airbus Group CEO Guillaume Faury singled out “lower performance in space” and “efforts to support sales” as key contributors to a 40% drop in the division’s adjusted earnings before interest and taxes.

Faury also said “postponed contracts on the defense side” factor into the layoffs.

“Airbus Defence and Space’s order intake and financial performance has been impacted and fallen short of our ambitions,” Faury said during an earnings call. “As a result, we are targeting a restructuring program to our cost structure and to restore profitability to high single-digit margins.”

Space comprises 26% of Airbus Defence and Space revenue, which stood at 10.9 billion euros for 2019, down 1.4% year over year. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes stood at 565 million euros, down from 935 million euros in 2018.

Airbus Defence and Space comprises 35,000 of Airbus Group’s 135,000 employees, Airbus Defence and Space spokesman Ralph Heinrich told SpaceNews by email. He declined to say how many space jobs would be cut.

Airbus Defence and Space is the third satellite manufacturer to announce layoffs in the past 12 months. Thales Alenia Space said in September it was cutting around 6% of its workforce, following Maxar’s February 2019 announcement that it would dismiss roughly 3% of its employees.

Satellite manufacturers globally have been struggling amid a multiyear slump in geostationary satellite orders that only neared historical buying rates last year. Satellite operators ordered 15 commercially competed geostationary communications spacecraft in 2019, more than the previous two years combined.

Airbus Group said it started consultations Feb. 19 with the European Works Council, the information and consultation organization representing its workers. The company proposes cutting the highest number of jobs in Germany — 829 — where the government’s ban on weapons exports to Saudi Arabia hampered sales. Spain is next with 630 proposed job cuts, followed by 404 in France, 357 in the United Kingdom and 142 elsewhere.

Airbus Group generated 70.5 billion euros in 2019 revenue, up from 63.7 billion in 2018. Airbus Defence and Space comprised about 15% of its 2019 revenue, down from 17% in 2018.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9973629117012024}",negative,0.9973629117012024,-1
Own a piece of the first Airbus A380 to be retired - CNN,"Tue, 18 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtYXZpYXRpb250YWcvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBPmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uL3RyYXZlbC9hcnRpY2xlL2FpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLWF2aWF0aW9udGFn?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CNN —

Hearts broke around the world on Valentine’s Day 2019, when Airbus announced that it was pulling the plug on its superjumbo A380 airplane.

However, A380 fans can now get their hands on their very own piece of the first A380 to enter scheduled service, a Singapore Airlines craft which was retired in 2017.

German company Aviationtag, which specializes in upcycling scrapped airplanes, has created a limited run of one-of-a-kind tags made from the fuselage of Airbus A380 97-SKA, which is also notable for being the first A380 to hit the scrapheap.

Each tag, which can be used a keychain or simply as a collector’s item, is made from either the hull, wings or tail unit of the double-decker behemoth – a little slice of aviation history.

They’re sized around 1.5 by 3.5 inches (35 by 88 millimeters) and retail at €27.95 ($30.19).

The historic craft, with the manufacturer serial number MSN 003, entered service with Singapore Airlines on the Singapore-Sydney route on October 25, 2007, as flight number SQ380.

The Airbus A380 was developed at a cost of $25 billion, but the MSN 003 flew just 10 years with Singapore Airlines before being retired, transferred to Tarbes in France and recycled in 2019.

It was not only the first A380 to enter scheduled service, but the first of the wide-body liners to be scrapped.

“It’s a painful decision,” Airbus CEO Tom Enders said in 2019, announcing the decision to discontinue the airplane. “We’ve invested a lot of effort, a lot of resources and a lot of sweat into this aircraft.”

With a capacity of up to 853 passengers, the A380 was the largest mass-produced civil airliner in history, but Airbus overestimated airlines’ appetite for the superjumbo.

By the time of the 2019 announcement, it had delivered just 234 of the craft – less than a quarter of the 1,200 it had predicted when the double-decker was introduced.

Airlines’ interest had shifted to lighter, more fuel-efficient craft and that gleaming bright jumbo was becoming more of a white elephant.

Aviationtag has been upcycling aviation materials since 2006, and has turned everything from commercial craft like the Boeing 747 to military planes such as the DC-3 “candy bomber” into collector’s items.

However, the company’s vice president, Tobias Richter, tells CNN Travel that working on this A380 was particularly special.

“Besides the fact that this is one of the largest and heaviest aircrafts that has ever flown, it was up in the sky for only 10 years,” he says. “For us the story behind the actual aircraft is always very important and if planes could talk, the MSN 3 would have lots to tell.”

The last set of A380 wings left the Airbus factory in Broughton, Wales, at the start of February 2020 and the final delivery of the superjumbo is scheduled for mid-2021, with Emirates being its farewell customer.

Putting together the A380 was a mammoth task, befitting the world’s largest passenger airliner, involving four million parts sourced from 30 countries.

Fuselage sections came from Hamburg, Germany, and Saint-Nazaire, France; the horizontal tailplane was manufactured in Cadiz, Spain; and the vertical tail fin was also made in Hamburg.

The Final Assembly Line (FAL) is in the Jean-Luc Lagardere plant, a purpose-built facility at Toulouse-Blagnac Airport in southern France.

Tarbes-based Tarmac Aerosave is the company responsible for taking apart the MSN 003 and announced the completion of its first A380 dismantling project in November 2019.

For Aviationtag, getting its hands on this A380 was a big deal.

“Often times people think it is so easy to just go out and buy aircraft material, but it is not,” explains Richter. “Companies at aircraft boneyards and teardown facilities get hundreds of calls and mails every day from people who want to buy some material from them.

“So you need to have a good reputation in the industry and also be well connected to actually get a chance to talk to the right people.”

All the tags come with serial numbers and registration details so fans can look up the craft’s history.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999920129776001}",neutral,0.9999920129776001,0
"Airbus Defence and Space to cut over 2,300 jobs - Tech Xplore","Wed, 19 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHhwbG9yZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIwLTAyLWFpcmJ1cy1kZWZlbmNlLXNwYWNlLWpvYnMuaHRtbNIBQWh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHhwbG9yZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIwLTAyLWFpcmJ1cy1kZWZlbmNlLXNwYWNlLWpvYnMuYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"France-based Airbus last week reported a net loss of 1.36 billion euros in 2019

European plane-maker Airbus said Wednesday it planned to cut 2,362 jobs in its Defence and Space division over the next two years.

Airbus cited a ""flat space market and postponed contracts on the defence side"" for the decision to cut 829 jobs in Germany, 630 in Spain, 404 in France and 357 in Britain.

A further 142 jobs will be cut in other countries, it said, adding that it was in talks with its European works council on the restructuring.

""Airbus Defence and Space will provide updates on its plans and continues a constructive dialogue with employee representatives,"" it said in a statement.

The Defence and Space division accounts for 15 percent of the group's revenue.

It posted operating losses of 881 million euros ($951 million) in 2019.

Airbus said that ""while the underlying business perspectives, especially in the core business, remain solid"", job cuts were necessary after the book-to-bill ratio—the ratio of orders received to amounts billed—fell below 1 for the third year in a row.

France-based Airbus last week reported a net loss of 1.36 billion euros in 2019, mainly due to a 3.6-billion-euro fine over a bribery scandal and extra development costs for the A400M transport aircraft.

Protecting Earth from asteroids: Airbus has a solution - Airbus,"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIwLTAyLXByb3RlY3RpbmctZWFydGgtZnJvbS1hc3Rlcm9pZHMtYWlyYnVzLWhhcy1hLXNvbHV0aW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It’s a scenario worthy of a Hollywood movie thriller: an approaching asteroid threatens the Earth, and an industry team is busily working on converting a telecommunications satellite into a kinetic interceptor to deflect this incoming menace.

At Airbus, fiction has become reality, as the company’s Defence and Space operation in Germany is developing the Fast Kinetic impactor Deflection mission concept (FastKD), which would provide a rapid space-based deflection capability in an asteroid-to-Earth impact warning time of less than three years.

Adapting a telecom satellite for the asteroid deflection

The tight schedule would be maintained by taking a commercially available telecommunications satellite and repurposing it for the kinetic deflection attempt. After minor modifications are made to the spacecraft’s platform and subsystems, an off-the-shelf kinetic impactor deflection module is added. With a ready-for-launch timing of six months, the preparation is significantly shorter than any other space science or exploration mission.

Kinematic impactors are among the simplest deflection techniques with the highest technology readiness levels – and can be easily achieved with European capabilities.

Deflection success is dependent on how the momentum is imparted by the impacting spacecraft, and how early the deflection impact event occurs before the approach to Earth. With a longer warning time, the spacecraft could undergo additional modifications and optimisation, and even be subjected to detailed testing/validation before launch to increase the deflection performance.

European technology and Airbus’ integrator expertise

The threat is real: on 15 February 2013, a previously undetected meteorite exploded in the atmosphere above Russia’s Ural Mountains, and the resulting shock wave caused extensive damage and injuries. Asteroids are larger than meteorites, and they have created at least 170 impact craters on the Earth.

Implementing a rapid-response, deep-space deflection mission is extremely challenging and complex. The need to act must come from a compelling political desire, while building on the successful heritage of European technology and in-house expertise. Airbus – as a large system integrator – is ideally positioned to respond to this challenge.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9731701612472534}",neutral,0.9731701612472534,0
What it's like to fly the new five-bladed H145 - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 19 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVzL3doYXQtaXRzLWxpa2UtdG8tZmx5LXRoZS1uZXctZml2ZS1ibGFkZWQtaDE0NS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The walls of the Airbus Helicopters customer center at Donauwörth are adorned with images celebrating the achievements of Messerschmitt, Bölkow and Blohm (MBB); legendary aircraft designers whose eponymous company produced the Bo.105 light twin helicopter in the late 1960s.

That iconic design pioneered a hingeless titanium monoblock rotor head that was truly ahead of its time, providing direct control and excellent maneuverability. It was so successful that when MBB collaborated with Kawasaki Heavy Industries in 1977 to design the BK-117 to replace it, they used the 105’s head as a basis for the new rotor system.

Four decades later MBB has, through various acquisitions, become Airbus Helicopters. So too has their helicopter of the late ’70s subtly but perceptibly changed. More powerful engines progressively increased its 6,283-pound (2,850-kilogram) gross weight, and the integration of technology from the (then Eurocopter) EC135 further expanded its utility. In the new millennium, it got a facelift that gave marketers an opportunity to change the name on the sales literature, if not the type certificate, as it became the EC145.

By 2014, the wholesale replacement of the tail with a Fenestron and the integration of Airbus Helicopters’ proprietary Helionix avionics brought the aircraft right up to date, retitled as the H145, now tipping the scales at a maximum takeoff weight of 8,157 lb. (3,700 kg). Despite the name changes, you don’t have to look far to find its heritage. BK-117 still features in its type certificate and, throughout its life and in all its guises, the heart of the H145 has always been the MBB rotor head. Until now.

In early 2019, Airbus Helicopters announced the development of an entirely new rotor system for the H145, based on work that had been done on their Bluecopter prototype. The venerated MBB rotor is entirely gone on the new aircraft, with the new head featuring a bearingless design similar to that of the company’s smaller H135.

Axel Humpert, Airbus’s head of program for the H145, explained its inception: “The five-bladed H145 came up after research activity where we flew this type of rotor on a prototype based on the [H]135,” he said.

“We were receiving requests from the market all over the world asking for even more payload,” explained Humpert. “We took the chance of installing the new rotor on the H145 and the results were so promising . . . that we decided to go into serialization.”

I had the opportunity to fly one of the five-bladed H145 prototypes in late October. Demonstrating the aircraft was Volker Bau, chief test pilot at Donauwörth since 2010. He joined Airbus Helicopters in 2006 after a 20-year career flying in the German military.

In the cabin was Antoine Van Gent, Airbus Helicopters head of flight test since 2009. Having started as an F-16 maintenance officer, he flew almost every aircraft in the Royal Netherlands Air Force inventory during a 17-year career that included test pilot training, before joining Airbus Helicopters Germany in 2005.

Van Gent walked me around the machine prior to start and, understandably, the focus was on the rotor head.

Tricks up the sleeve

Unlike the previous four-blade system, the roots of the five new blades are attached directly onto the rotor mast. A composite flex beam buried inside the blade absorbs all the feathering and dragging loads, while the construction of the blade itself allows it to flap. Although the original design catered for flapping loads in the same way, the elimination of blade forks that attached the blades to the titanium star has moved the effective flapping hinge offset inboard, from 12 percent to seven percent of the blade span. In theory, this should grant more direct control and reduce any cross-coupling.

The whole arrangement certainly reduces maintenance, as the sleeve and spindle feathering hinge of the original is completely absent, and with it goes the necessity for lubrication and maintenance inspections. But that much technology literally baked into the blade comes at a cost. As any H135 owner who has dinged one on a hangar door will tell you, the place you’ll feel it the most is in your wallet. This system gets around that by separating the blade cuff, which contains the really expensive flex-beam, from the outboard blade with an attachment joint. This adds the facility to easily fold all the blades by removing one of the two bolts at each attachment joint. The new blades are already shorter than those that they replace, but this system dramatically reduces the aircraft footprint still further. Folded, it will fit inside a medium-sized transport aircraft, small hangar or large yacht, and can be prepared to fly again within about half an hour.

The sleek rotor hub has also significantly reduced rotor drag, providing more effective power that not only delivered an increase in gross weight to 8,377 lb. (3,800 kg), but also allowed Alex Neuhaus (Airbus Helicopters’ experimental test pilot) and Van Gent to land the unmodified prototype (including flight test equipment) on the summit of Aconcagua in Argentina; the highest mountain in the Southern Hemisphere at over 22,000 feet (6,705 meters).

Van Gent explained that from that 220-lb. (100-kg) increase in gross weight, the new aircraft was able to get an extra 330 lb. (150 kg) useful load. This was a result of the rotor head design and removal of the active vibration control systems, saving 116 lb. (53 kg). Impressive when you consider that they’ve added 25 percent more blades.

The new rotor system will also be available as a retrofit to its immediate forebear, the H145. While it will take around 250 hours of work to complete, it will be possible for any EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency) part 145 approved maintenance organization to carry out the procedure, so larger operators should be able to do this in-house.

I wanted to focus the flight test on the handling and performance of the aircraft, as the complex arrangement of opposing forces that keep a helicopter airborne mean that even minor tinkering with the rotor system is likely to have repercussions throughout the flight envelope, as Van Gent explained. “Normally you can have some surprises because of changes in rotor downwash, especially in the hover or at low speed, but here we didn’t need any aerodynamic fixes, it was very stable from the beginning.”

This trend continued throughout the flight test regime, Bau told me: “Normally you find a corner [of the flight envelope that means] the aircraft needs some modification, and you have to adjust the airframe, which is expensive. Here there was almost nothing.”

Being a prototype, our machine had some idiosyncrasies that included an elongated pitot probe/airflow vane attached to the nose and 130 kg (285 lb.) of flight test equipment in the cabin, from which flowed the associated orange cabling (this will, of course, be absent in production aircraft and their exposed conduits covered by aircraft interior trim).

With Bau in the right-hand pilot seat and me in the left, Van Gent was joined by Vertical photographer Lloyd Horgan in the cabin, bringing our takeoff weight to around 7,937 lb. (3,600 kg) with around 75 percent fuel. Outside it was a chilly, but not unpleasant, 6 C (43 F) at Donauwörth’s airfield, at an elevation of 1,315 feet above mean sea level. We had about 10 knots of wind.

With power on in the aircraft, the Airbus proprietary Helionix avionics system was brought to life and we were ready to fly in just over five minutes using the normal start procedure, even with a delay to carry out built-in-tests of the flight test equipment. In an operational scenario, Airbus said the aircraft can go from cold and dark to ready to fly within two minutes.

Smooth operator

Lifting into the hover, the reason for the removal of the active vibration control was immediately apparent — there wouldn’t be anything for it to do. The hover and hover-taxi were startlingly smooth and, although not entirely eliminated, the vibration was very subtle. Whether as a result of a reduction in magnitude, or an increase in frequency, felt vibration levels in the front-left seat were so low that I had to consciously focus on it to discern it. Horgan – who has certainly flown in more helicopter cabins than I have – was equally impressed in the cabin. With the H145’s popularity as a helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) platform, medical professionals may benefit from the smooth ride — and their patients even more so.

“I was project pilot and did all three first flights,” Bau told me, referring to the three developmental stages of the rotor. “We expected there would be a reduction in vibration with this rotor, but we were still surprised by how much.” He later clarified that the rotor on the production aircraft is “99 percent” the same as the original test blade.

Positioning over the “H” at Donauwörth, Bau demonstrated the GTCH (Ground Trajectory Command Hover) mode, in which the aircraft is held in a GPS-derived position or can maintain a vector as demanded by the pilot. “I call it the ‘follow the boat’ mode,” he told me. With a bit of time flying search-and-rescue in my past, my winchmen doubtless would have appreciated that function.

The new H145 will be certified up to its maximum gross weight in Performance Class 1 (PC1), and the profile has already been approved by EASA. “Alex Neuhaus developed it,” Bau explained. “He’s very creative and it’s a bit different.”

With the aircraft held in a GTCH hover, a slight increase in power was all that was necessary to start the aircraft climbing vertically, with a blue line on the first limit indicator providing a cue to assess engine power in case of a failure. At around 200 feet, pressing the “train” button simulated an engine failure, complete with transient main rotor speed (Nr) droop and a slight kick of yaw. A subtle check down on the collective was all that was necessary to reject the takeoff and begin a descent. With the “H” now invisible directly beneath me, my references had all but disappeared. But that didn’t matter to the autopilot, as it guided us vertically straight back down to a low hover precisely where we started, from which a single-engine landing would have been easily performed.

As luck would have it, the weather was beautiful for our flight, with clear blue skies as we left Donauwörth behind us. However, Bau demonstrated that should a pilot inadvertently enter cloud, with one push of a button on the cyclic the aircraft would right itself and recover to straight and level flight. From there, the HTAWS (helicopter terrain avoidance and warning system) and the synthetic vision system would help a disoriented pilot regain situational awareness, using a representation of the terrain in front and providing audio warnings.

Even up to 140 knots, the aircraft itself was still unnervingly smooth and as expected, the four-axis autopilot integrated into the Helionix system provided a very stable cruise. But I wasn’t here to let the computer have all the fun, so Bau sequentially disengaged the automation, initially retaining the attitude hold mode. Flying the aircraft on the trim switch is recommended in this mode, with the aircraft responding promptly and without the lag present in some similar systems. As expected, disengaging the stability augmentation entirely resulted in the nose moving around a little more, but the aircraft remained remarkably stable and this improved further once I’d figured out where exactly the speed stable attitude was. The direct control feel was evident in this regime and subtle movements of the cyclic were required, but the control forces were enough that it never felt at all twitchy.

With the attitude hold mode back on, we repositioned for an approach into an unfamiliar (for me, at least) off-field landing site; a local gliding field surrounded by woods. The vast areas of transparency in the cockpit made it easy to keep the landing site in view throughout the circuit and approach, even though I made the approach slightly steeper than I had intended. As we decelerated to the hover, the vibration increased but only just enough to be noticeable. The aircraft was as stable as expected in the hover and the position was easily maintained without any skittishness in the ground cushion. The site that we were in wasn’t particularly confined, especially in comparison to the places that HEMS operators will expect to take this aircraft, but they will doubtless appreciate the extra flexibility and margin that the reduced rotor diameter offers.

Reentering GTCH mode, I carried out a vertical climb and departed back in the direction of Donauwörth, with the aircraft flying through translational lift with less of a rumble than it had on the way in.

With our time in the air coming to an end, I handed the controls back to Bau so that he could demonstrate some more advanced maneuvering back at Donauwörth. There followed a series of wingovers, tight turns and rapid entries to the hover in various relative wind directions, which were smoothly flown and smoothly absorbed by the aircraft. Naturally, these kinds of profiles increased the vibration to a level that might have raised the eyebrows of VIP passengers, but operators required to perform such vigorous maneuvers are typically transporting passengers of a slightly more robust — and possibly less discerning — nature.

On the topic of para-public and military roles, the increased gross weight is likely to be a higher priority than the improved ride quality; however, given that the crew on such operations might well be required to spend lengthy periods in the aircraft, the cumulative effect of vibration on crew fatigue shouldn’t be trivialized.

Good vibes

Left alone on the ramp with the aircraft as Bau completed the post-flight paperwork, I had a chance to reflect on the experience.

The basic design of the aircraft’s principal components is not new. The rotor system is a direct descendent from that of an H135 — albeit with an additional blade — and the fuselage is effectively the same as the H145 it will replace. While it is undoubtedly an improvement, some might suggest that the new rotor system is simply an opportunity for Airbus Helicopters to recoup some of the R&D euros that were spent bolstering its eco-credentials. I think this is an overly cynical view. Market desire for an aircraft with more usable weight undoubtedly existed, and Airbus Helicopters’ previous offering to meet this demand was a stripped-down version of the legacy airframe, compromising its instrument flight rules (IFR) capability and at odds with the company’s own drive towards consolidation of the type.

With weight-saving from a well-understood and highly integrated platform seemingly not an option, Airbus Helicopters was left needing more power. Bigger engines wouldn’t be an easy fix, and would also likely mean upgrading the transmission, which is a Kawasaki responsibility. With such a seemingly intractable problem, the trial results from the over-scale Bluecopter rotor must have seemed like serendipity, but in the moment, it’s not always easy to match the solution with the problem. Over lunch, Van Gent explained to me that alongside the technical challenge was the necessity to convince colleagues that the new blades would even work. Axel Humpert had joked, “All we needed from the engineers was more lift and less drag — easy!”

So no, the new five-bladed H145 doesn’t represent a leap in capability and it hasn’t turned the aircraft into a new helicopter, but it wasn’t designed to. It provides a tried and trusted workhorse with a truly innovative rotor system worthy of taking the place of its ground-breaking MBB forerunner.

The new aircraft received type certification by EASA in June 2020, and the last of the original H145s are likely to roll off the production line in 2021. The increased performance and reduced maintenance overheads offered by the new version might coax EC- and even BK- legacy operators to upgrade, particularly as the new aircraft will be available in the same price bracket as its precursor. Likewise, with EASA certification clearing the way for customer deliveries toward the end of summer 2020, the retrofit is likely to be popular with existing H145 users that need the additional usable load. Larger operations with their own part 145 facility stand to benefit the most. Finally, of course, there will always be the few for whom comfort in the cruise has no price; they will certainly feel the benefit.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.97978276014328}",positive,0.97978276014328,1
How is the aviation industry reducing carbon emissions? - World Economic Forum,"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndlZm9ydW0ub3JnL2FnZW5kYS8yMDIwLzAyL2FpcmJ1cy1wbGFuZS1kZXNpZ24tYXZpYXRpb24taW5ub3ZhdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has been testing a new aircraft design which melds the body and wings together.

It's designed to cut carbon emissions by 20% by producing less aerodynamic drag.

Airbus (AIR.PA) on Tuesday unveiled a curvaceous aircraft design that blends wing and body, designed to slash carbon emissions by some 20%.

The European planemaker has been carrying out flight tests of a 3.2-metre-wide (10.5 feet) technology demonstrator, code-named Maveric, at a secret location in central France since last year. It lifted the veil on the design at the Singapore Airshow.

The concept of a “blended wing body” design has been around since the 1940s and led to the U.S. B-2 bomber, as well as the X-48 research project between Boeing and NASA a decade ago.

Such aircraft are complex to control but produce less aerodynamic drag, making them more efficient to fly.

Planemakers are revisiting such designs as the passenger jet industry tries to commit to more environmentally friendly aircraft.

“We believe it is high time now to push this technology further and study what it brings to us,” Jean-Brice Dumont, executive vice-president of engineering at Airbus, told reporters. “We need these disruptive technologies to meet our environmental challenge. It is the next generation of aircraft; we are studying an option.”

He said it was too early to say whether such shapes could contribute to the next generation of medium-haul planes, expected in the 2030s.

Since the previous generation of tests, aerospace has seen improvements in materials that make such aircraft lighter, and computing power has increased, improving flight controls, Dumont said.

Airbus is now studying how the cabin would work and how the aircraft would be integrated into airports. One unresolved question is whether such a plane would have windows or use video screens to give passengers a sense of their surroundings.

Another issue that has dogged such experiments in the past is how to handle sensations of movement.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9993041753768921}",neutral,0.9993041753768921,0

At 2 metres long and 3.2 metres wide, with a surface area of about 2.25m², MAVERIC features a disruptive aircraft design, that has the potential to reduce fuel consumption by up to 20 percent compared to current single-aisle aircraft.

The “blended wing body” configuration also opens up new possibilities for propulsion systems type and integration, as well as a versatile cabin for a totally new on-board passenger experience.

Launched in 2017, MAVERIC first took to the skies in June 2019. Since then the flight-test campaign has been on-going and will continue until the end of Q2 2020.

“Airbus is leveraging emerging technologies to pioneer the future of flight. By testing disruptive aircraft configurations, Airbus is able to evaluate their potential as viable future products,” said Jean-Brice Dumont, EVP Engineering Airbus. “Although there is no specific time line for entry-into-service, this technological demonstrator could be instrumental in bringing about change in commercial aircraft architectures for an environmentally sustainable future for the aviation industry.”

Airbus is using its core strengths and capabilities of engineering and manufacturing, in close collaboration with an extended innovation ecosystem, to accelerate traditional research and development cycles. By doing this Airbus is able to achieve proof of concepts, at a convincing scale and speed, thereby driving forward maturity and increasing their value.

Through AirbusUpNext, a research programme, Airbus is currently working on a number of demonstrator projects in parallel; E-FAN X (hybrid-electric propulsion), fello’fly (v-shaped “formation” flight) and ATTOL (Autonomous Taxi Take-Off & Landing).

Airbus SE pledged to churn out more aircraft than ever and consolidated its ownership of the A220 jetliner, pressing home its advantage over Boeing Co. and its grounded 737 Max in the growing narrow-body market.

The European planemaker said Feb. 13 that it expects to hand over about 880 jets in 2020, building on record output last year. Deliveries of the A320-family workhorse, a direct competitor to the Max, will rise to as many as 67 a month by 2023, while the smaller A220 will also see volumes accelerate.

Together, the moves are meant to draw a line under a tumultuous 2019 after production shortcomings prevented Airbus from fully exploiting the Max crisis at its U.S. rival. The Toulouse, France-based planemaker also ran into trouble with its military transport plane, the A400M, canceled the ambitious A380 super-jumbo and settled a longstanding bribery probe for 3.6 billion euros ($3.9 billion), driving annual results to a loss.

“We’ve put a lot behind us in 2019 and are now looking at 2020 to set the foundations of sustainable growth,” CEO Guillaume Faury told reporters. “We want to continue to gain contracts, to maintain the visibility we have today.”

Airbus is paying $591 million to the A220’s developer, Bombardier Inc., to boost its stake in the program to 75%, expanding its bet on a plane that seats 100 to 150 people and complements the larger A320.

Host Seth Clevenger went to CES 2020 in Las Vegas and met with Rich Mohr of Ryder Fleet Management Solutions and Stephan Olsen of the Paccar Innovation Center to discuss how high-tech the industry has become. Listen to a snippet above, and to hear the full episode, go to RoadSigns.TTNews.com.

The promise of the new plane was underscored on Feb. 13 when Airbus announced an outline agreement to sell 50 to Nigeria’s Green Africa Airways. It’s a coup for the A220, after the startup originally ordered the Boeing Max, which has been idled since last March.

“We have opportunities with the A220,” Faury said. “We see it can be a solution for some of the needs of the market.”

For Montreal-based Bombardier, exiting the A220 program closes the book on more than $6 billion of investment that was meant to challenge the two top planemakers, but instead left it saddled with debt that has forced the company into a breakup.

Originally named the C Series, the A220 won praise for fuel-efficient engines, composite wings and an airy cabin featuring large windows. But the plane ran more than two years late and about $2 billion over budget, and had trouble attracting buyers in an industry dominated by Airbus and Boeing.

After U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration imposed tariffs of about 300% on the jet, Bombardier agreed to sell about half the program to Airbus. Still, the Canadian company was left with hundreds of millions of dollars of funding obligations. Those are now gone, and with the Feb. 13 deal the government of Quebec lifted its share in the A220 program to 25%.

After also selling its turboprop-plane business, its regional jet arm and a wing plant in Belfast, Bombardier is in advanced talks to sell its rail business to French rival Alstom SA, people familiar with the matter said Thursday. The embattled manufacturer is mulling the disposal of its corporate-jet operation to Textron Inc., maker of Cessna planes, the Wall Street Journal has said.

Shares of Airbus fell 1.6% as of 12:34 p.m. in Paris, after announcing full-year results that were blighted by one-time charges.

Speaking Feb. 13 at Airbus’s annual press conference in Toulouse, Frane, Airbus Group CEO Guillaume Faury described the helicopter division’s performance as “strong, especially given the weak market.” Airbus Helicopters has increased its market share despite adverse conditions, he said. The company delivered 332 rotorcraft in 2019, representing 54 percent of the market in units, Airbus claimed.

The company received a net 310 orders, which was a decline of 19 percent from the previous year. The book-to-bill ratio was above 1:1 in value, despite the weaker orders. In average, higher-value helicopters were ordered, including 25 H225M Super Pumas, 23 NH90s (Airbus is a partner in the program) and 10 of the upcoming medium H160.

The H125 and H145 remain at the top in units ordered, with 130 and 91 orders in 2019, respectively. The H175 super medium twin, despite being the newest design in Airbus Helicopters’ range of certified aircraft, received a mere four orders.

“The increased contribution from support and services and key wins in the military sector in 2019 underline the importance of our robust business model,” said Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters, in a press release announcing the results. He characterized the civil and parapublic market as “challenging.” Faury emphasizes “good prospects in defense” and also wants to “capture growth in services” in 2020.

In 2019, military revenues were dominant, at 55 percent. Services contributed 43 percent to the company’s total revenues. On the civil side, for instance, HCare contracts were signed for an additional 250 helicopters.

As of Dec. 31, 2019, the backlog stood at 695, almost stable from one year before. Revenues slightly improved, at €6 billion ($6.6 billion). The profit margin, calculated from adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, reached seven percent.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999818801879883}",positive,0.9999818801879883,1

While its 2019 orders far outstripped Boeing’s, sales were still down from a year earlier. A combination of slowing economic growth, rising trade tensions, and self-inflicted problems that have prevented Airbus from capitalizing on its spot at the top.

Its most recent problem has been a long time coming. Last week saw the conclusion of a nearly four year investigation into Airbus by authorities in France, the UK, and the US, which revealed widespread corruption and bribery. The company reached a deal to settle allegations it paid bribes to land deals with airlines across China, Taiwan, and Malaysia, among other countries. Of the 406 aircraft purchased by AirAsia and AirAsia X between 2005 and 2014, 180 were secured “by way of improper payments, and the offer of a further improper payment.” The company must now pay a €3.6 billion ($4 billion) fine to European and US regulators.

Harder to resolve are its ongoing headaches along the production line. It is producing barely 700 A320neo jets a year, despite a backlog of more than 6,000. Airlines ordering the planes now—the most obvious substitute for the 737 Max 8—must wait a minimum of nine years to receive them. In late October, it was forced to slash its delivery goal for the year, due to ongoing troubles and delays from engine manufacturers. This has a considerable effect on cash flow: plane manufacturers are usually paid when they deliver their planes, rather than when they are ordered.

Airline bosses, who might ordinarily be clamoring for Airbus planes, have instead grown jaded by their repeated missed deadlines. At last year’s Paris airshow, Willie Walsh, the outspoken CEO for British Airways’ parent company, the International Airlines Group, placed a $24 billion order for 200 737 Maxes, despite the fact that it is not known when—or if—they will fly again. “[It] should be an indication not just to Airbus but to everybody that we’re unhappy with their performance,” Walsh said, at the time. “I know everybody interprets it as an issue of price, it’s not.” (Boeing reportedly offered the airline a special deal on the grounded planes.)

Airbus comments French Navy lease-purchase of H160 SAR helicopters - Naval News,"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDIwLzAyL2FpcmJ1cy1jb21tZW50cy1mcmVuY2gtbmF2eS1sZWFzZS1wdXJjaGFzZS1vZi1oMTYwLXNhci1oZWxpY29wdGVycy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus comments French Navy lease-purchase of H160 SAR helicopters The French Armament General Directorate (DGA) is to supply four H160s to the French Navy for search and rescue missions through a partnership between Airbus Helicopters, Babcock, and Safran Helicopter Engines. The contract was awarded on January 31, 2020. The French Navy will start operating these helicopters in 2022 for a period of ten years.

Airbus Helicopters press release

Babcock became the global launch customer for the H160 after signing a five year frame agreement for the purchase of a fleet of H160s in March, 2018. The fleet of H160s is destined for EMS and other critical services missions starting in Europe and to be deployed progressively across Babcock’s bases worldwide.

This interim fleet of H160s will enable the French Navy to ensure the continuity of these critical missions in the Atlantic and the Channel as the Alouette III retires from service and pending Guépard deliveries. Airbus Helicopters, and its partners, will also be responsible for supporting the fleet with a high level of availability and performance commitments. In addition, French Navy operational feedback will be monitored to benefit the design of the military version of the H160 and its support system.

“We are proud that the French Navy will be operating the H160 for their search and rescue missions. We are sure that the improved situational awareness, increased pilot assistance, and visibility that the H160 provides will prove to be a valuable asset for their critical and demanding missions”, said Bruno Even, Airbus Helicopters CEO.

“Our industrial partnership with Babcock and Safran Helicopter Engines will allow us to ensure the highest level of availability for the French Navy and we are honoured to have been entrusted with this mission”. Bruno Even, Airbus Helicopters CEO

The H160, as a next generation medium twin engine aircraft, powered by Arrano engines, was designed to be a modular helicopter in order to address missions ranging from offshore transportation, private and business aviation, emergency medical services, and public services. Its entry into service is planned for later in 2020.

First deliveries of the equally modular military version, the H160M, or Guépard as it known in the French armed forces are planned in 2026. 169 H160Ms are foreseen in the frame of the Joint Light Helicopter programme (Hélicoptère Interarmées Léger: HIL) to replace five types of helicopters in service in the French armed forces.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.5094269514083862}",positive,0.5094269514083862,1
Record bribery fine fuels Airbus loss of €1.4bn - The Guardian,"Thu, 13 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIwL2ZlYi8xMy9yZWNvcmQtYnJpYmVyeS1maW5lLWZ1ZWxzLWFpcmJ1cy1sb3NzLW9mLTE0Ym7SAV5odHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMC9mZWIvMTMvcmVjb3JkLWJyaWJlcnktZmluZS1mdWVscy1haXJidXMtbG9zcy1vZi0xNGJu?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has slumped to a €1.4bn (£1.17bn) annual loss after receiving record fines for bribery, but raised its dividend as aircraft deliveries hit an all-time high.

The European aerospace group’s 2019 loss contrasts with a net profit of €3.1bn the previous year.

The Toulouse-based company had to set aside €3.6bn last month to cover settlements with authorities in the US, France and Britain after admitting it had paid huge bribes on an “endemic” basis to secure contracts in 20 countries. The penalties amount to the largest-ever corporate fine issued for bribery.

Airbus also lost €1.2bn last year due to problems with its A400M military transport programme, and a further €221m because the German government extended a ban on export licences to Saudi Arabia through March.

However, revenues climbed 11% to €70.5bn last year, and Airbus said it would pay a dividend of €1.80 a share, up 9%. It delivered a record 863 commercial planes in 2019, up from 800 in 2018, including 112 A350s and 642 A320s. The group expects deliveries to rise further this year, to 880 commercial aircraft.

Airbus boosted orders to 768 last year as its main rival, Boeing, struggled following the grounding of the 737 Max jet after two crashes killed 346 people. The US firm lost orders last year for the first time in three decades and delivered only 380 commercial airplanes.

Airbus is one of the biggest manufacturers in the UK, where it employs more than 14,000 people. A further 110,000 supply-chain jobs depend on its operations, which have an annual turnover of £6bn.

The firm manufactures aircraft wing in Broughton, north Wales, where it employs 6,000 people. A further 3,000 people work at the Airbus design and engineering site in Filton, Bristol.

Airbus has repeatedly expressed serious concerns about Brexit and a year ago, the then-Airbus chief executive Tom Enders warned the aerospace firm could pull out of the UK if there is a no-deal Brexit.

The group said adjusted operating profits, excluding the bribery settlement and other one-offs, rose 19% to €6.9bn last year and were expected to reach €7.5bn in 2020. Its forecast assumes there are no major disruptions to the global economy and air traffic, including from the coronavirus.

“We achieved a great deal in 2019,” said the Airbus chief executive, Guillaume Faury, who took over from Enders in April. “The level of confidence in our ability to continue to deliver sustainable growth going forward has led to a dividend proposal of €1.80 per share. Our focus in 2020 will be on reinforcing our company culture, improving operationally, and adjusting our cost structure to strengthen the financial performance and prepare for the future.”","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.991060197353363}",negative,0.991060197353363,-1
Airbus And Boeing Working On Next Steps For Fuel-saving Wake Surfing - Aviation Week,"Fri, 14 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9zcGVjaWFsLXRvcGljcy9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS9haXJidXMtYm9laW5nLXdvcmtpbmctbmV4dC1zdGVwcy1mdWVsLXNhdmluZy13YWtlLXN1cmZpbmfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When Airbus in November announced it would demonstrate energy-saving automated formation flight in 2020 using two A350s, and Boeing subsequently revealed it had flight-tested the concept in 2018 with two 777s, it was a signal that a long-known technique could soon be ready for prime time.

Air-wake surfing for efficiency has a long pedigree of consistent research results that show an aircraft can save fuel by flying within the updraft created by the wingtip vortices shed by another—reclaiming energy left in the atmosphere by the lead aircraft’s lift-induced drag.

Significant promise but substantial challenges for wake surfing

Aircraft systems, planning tools and operating procedures are key

Since researchers at Germany’s Technical University of Braunschweig proved the concept in flight in 1984, achieving a 15% power reduction by manually flying two Dornier Do 28s wingtip behind wingtip, multiple demonstrations with different aircraft types have shown fuel savings from wake surfing ranging from 8-18%.

So why are operators, commercial or military, not already using the technique to improve efficiency? And why is it being looked at now? One reason is the availability of the avionics required to enable automated wake surfing, particularly automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B).

“Why now? ADS-B is now mandatory in the U.S., so we have the avionics to make this possible,” says Al Sipe, chief engineer for aviation efficiency at Boeing. “Why are we not doing it? The fuel savings are not small. We have the capability. But the regulations say don’t do it. So the next step is getting the regulations changed.”

With the benefits firmly established, Boeing’s test in 2018 with its 777F ecoDemonstrator flying behind another FedEx 777F and Airbus’ Fello’fly demonstration this year are developing systems and procedures airlines can use to safely and robustly take advantage of wake surfing.

“We have done enough tests to be confident we can do this with commercial aircraft,” says Sipe. “We think we will do it first with cargo aircraft, and we are working with Airbus on the regulatory aspects,” he told the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics SciTech conference in January.

Attention is shifting to the next steps: developing the safety case and taking it to the regulators to get the rules changed; agreeing on the procedures between aircraft, operators and air traffic control (ATC) that will enable wake surfing; and developing the business case for implementation.

There are two things wake surfing is not. The first is a drag reduction technique. Instead, to maintain steady, level flight within the updraft from the wake vortex, the aircraft must pitch nose-down so it is descending relative to the upward moving air. The lift vector, normally vertical, is tilted slightly forward. This counters some of the drag, requiring less thrust to maintain horizontal flight. This reduces fuel consumption.

The second is traditional formation flying. Military aircraft fly in close formation, a few wingspans apart. Commercial aircraft would fly in extended formation, up to 1 nm apart, on what the industry prefers to call “cooperative trajectories.” This greater distance—10 or more wingspans for commercial aircraft—reduces the fuel-saving benefit but eases the workload on the pilots.

While the physics of wake surfing are on a firm footing, there are many technical and operational questions still to be answered. In a formation, only the trail aircraft sees a fuel saving. “Who gets preference? Is that an airline problem or an ATC problem?” asks Sipe.

Nelson Brown, a test engineer who worked on NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center’s Automated Cooperative Trajectories (ACT) flight-test project in 2017, cites the example of existing airline agreements to exchange pilot jump-seat rides and suggests a “benefit today, pay back tomorrow” marketplace could emerge.

There is also the question of how big the fuel savings will be in actual operations. Tests of a prototype automated wake-surfing system conducted by DARPA, the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory and Boeing in 2012-13 using a pair of C-17 airlifters achieved a 10% fuel saving over more than 90 min. in extended formation.

But 10% is a best case and will not be achieved all of the time. “If we can argue that the trail aircraft in a formation can see an 8% reduction in fuel burn consistently; the pair will save approximately 4% during this phase of flight,” Tristan Flanzer, Boeing flight controls engineer, told the conference.

“The aircraft are not in formation all the time, so accounting for other phases of flight, such as departure and landing, the savings may be reduced to 3%,” he says. There is then the matter of what fraction of an airline’s fleet will be in a formation at any time. “If half of all flights are paired off, the system level saving is 1.5%. So the real benefit is an order of magnitude lower,” says Flanzer.

This is still a significant saving, but wake surfing for efficiency is not just a technical challenge. “There needs to be a clear value proposition for the airlines, a well-defined conops [concept of operations] to understand the technical and operational needs, a provably safe system architecture and a plan to certify the system,” he says.

Boeing is proposing a conops with four distinct phases: premission, departure and single flight, cooperative trajectory operations, and split and post-flight. It assumes: aircraft are equipped with upgraded autopilot and autothrottle, ADS-B “In” and flight deck alerting updates; pilots have been trained in manual recovery from wake-induced upsets; and operations have been approved. Unless they are ex-military, commercial pilots will not have experienced flying in extended formation, so training is important.

The premission phase begins months in advance, with strategic planning to adjust flight schedules and maximize the opportunities for cooperative flying. Once aircraft pairs and schedule times have been identified, detailed flight plans are produced for each aircraft. Prior to departure of the first aircraft, the crews of both will conduct a preflight briefing of lead/trail responsibilities and rendezvous information. Both crews will monitor the continued viability of cooperative operations up to departure.

The aircraft may be leaving from different airports, at different times, so their departures must be closely coordinated. “Any delay is most efficiently absorbed while the second aircraft is still on the ground,” says Flanzer.

Current winds aloft strongly influence achievable formation benefits, and airlines will have to be flexible on departure times to get a wind-optimal routing for a formation that avoids incurring a large detour that costs fuel, Tobias Mark, a researcher at German aerospace center DLR, told the conference.

Once both aircraft are airborne, their onboard flight-management systems or ground-based interval management is used to adjust speed and coordinate arrival at the rendezvous point under ATC-assured separation with 2,000 ft. vertical spacing between the aircraft.

The cooperative trajectory operations phase has four subphases. The first is merge, the transition from ATC-assured horizontal separation of 5-50 nm to station-keeping managed by the crew of the trail aircraft. Using data transmitted by the lead aircraft, the trail aircraft stabilizes approximately 1 nm behind it and 500 ft. to the left or right of the predicted position of the lead aircraft’s wake vortices.

The two aircraft then join, the crews informing ATC they have assumed responsibility for separation and the lead aircraft taking leadership of the flight. ATC then deals with the pair as a flight of two operating within a 2,000-ft. block of altitude.

Now in stabilized formation, the trail pilot engages cooperative-trajectory mode to begin wake capture and tracking. Lead-aircraft data and own-ship information is used to predict wake position. With autopilot and autothrottle engaged, the wake capture function moves the trail aircraft into the ideal position—about 200 ft. from the vortex—based on ride quality and fuel saving.

The C-17 flights and NASA’s ACT tests involving a pair of Gulfstream GIIIs reported only “light chop” when surfing the wake, but it is a trade between ride quality and fuel saving. The crew can “turn the knob,” Brown says, surfing the wake more closely for fuel saving when passengers are awake, but moving further away at night to improve ride quality while they sleep. There will also be some threshold of atmospheric turbulence beyond which wake surfing is not possible, he says.

Once joined, the trail aircraft flies automatically, a situational-awareness display showing the crew its position relative to both the lead aircraft and its predicted wake. If the lead aircraft needs to change speed, altitude or heading, the intent is transmitted to the trail aircraft, which may have to move away from the wake during the maneuver. To avoid crossing the wake, a prevention and recovery function can command the trail aircraft away from the wake to avoid upsets and loads.

On reaching a preplanned point on the route, the pair will split, the lead aircraft notifying ATC, which reestablishes standard separation between them. “[Cooperative trajectory] operations will only be conducted during the cruise phases of flight, so ATC-supportable separation must be achieved at the latest by 150-200 nm from destination,” says Flanzer.

The takeaways from this conops, he says, include the need for tools for both strategic and detail mission planning, the importance of ADS-B and of leveraging existing interval management tools during the transition, and the requirement for new autopilot submodes.

The concept is based on predicting, rather than measuring, the wake position. When the trail aircraft is following behind by 20 wingspans, or about 4,000 ft, the vortices shed by the lead can drift significantly. The rate at which the wake sinks depends on the lead’s type, weight and speed, while the rate at which it drifts depends on winds aloft. Predicting position requires data from the lead aircraft.

“Absent a sensor to detect the wake, we have to use an aircraft-to-aircraft data link,” says Flanzer. “ADS-B is appealing because of its prevalence, but does it provide enough information and resolution to predict the wake? And how do we provide enough integrity to maintain safe separation?” The consensus is that ADS-B alone is not adequate.

For the level of reliable wake prediction necessary for routine commercial cooperative-trajectory operations, ADS-B data alone is likely insufficient for the actual wake-surfing phase, he says, adding: “For other aspects of the join, it does provide enough accuracy.” There are also ways to improve or augment ADS-B.

Accuracy of the wake prediction could be increased by adding wind data to the information broadcast by the lead aircraft, and a proposal to add these messages to the next standard of ADS-B, Version 3, is on the table, says Sipe. Mode S Enhanced Surveillance (EHS) already has this information, but the aircraft’s transponder must be interrogated for the data, and normally only ground radars do this.

For Boeing’s 777F ecoDemonstrator flight test, Aviation Communication & Surveillance Systems modified its traffic collision alert system (TCAS) to perform airborne interrogation of the lead aircraft for EHS data. The system sent ADS-B and EHS data to a flight-test laptop that hosted the wake prediction algorithm on the trail aircraft. The laptop then sent a command to the autopilot’s localizer control law, which was used to keep the aircraft on station relative to the wake. “ADS-B plus TCAS may work,” says Flanzer.

For maximum aerodynamic benefit, wake position must be known to within a few percent of wingspan, around 10 ft. for large commercial aircraft. This is beyond the 30-m (100-ft.) accuracy normally assumed for unaugmented GPS. If both aircraft are viewing the same satellites, they can navigate relative to each other with much greater accuracy, but this would require new ADS-B messages, and “we can’t count on the aircraft in a formation always seeing the same satellites,” he says. “We are going to need some way to sense position inside the wake,” says Sipe.

Despite the challenges that still lie ahead, wake surfing for efficiency continues to show promise, for both commercial and military operations. Maj. Will Guthrie, a U.S. Air Force Reserve tanker pilot who is also a FedEx pilot, says the cargo airline has several aircraft flying in the same direction, to Los Angeles and San Francisco, London and Paris, just minutes apart every day. “There is no reason not to link up so the trailing aircraft can take the benefit,” he told the conference.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9283190965652466}",positive,0.9283190965652466,1
Singapore to pilot enhanced Airbus tanker refuelling kit - Defense News,"Wed, 12 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWZlbnNlbmV3cy5jb20vZGlnaXRhbC1zaG93LWRhaWxpZXMvc2luZ2Fwb3JlLWFpcnNob3cvMjAyMC8wMi8xMi9zaW5nYXBvcmUtdG8tcGlsb3QtZW5oYW5jZWQtYWlyYnVzLXRhbmtlci1yZWZ1ZWxsaW5nLWtpdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SINGAPORE – Singapore will be the launch customer of a series of enhancements for the Airbus A330 multi-role tanker transport, or MRTT, and will collaborate in the development and certification process together with the European aircraft manufacturer.

The collaboration will see one of Singapore’s six A330 MRTTs take part in the ongoing development, flight test campaign and final certification program, and will make the small southeast Asian island nation become a key partner for the new automated aerial-refueling capabilities that are being developed, according to Airbus.

The flight test campaign for the improved aircraft, which Airbus calls the Smart MRTT, has already started and certification is targeted for 2021, according to a press release issued at the ongoing Singapore Airshow.

Johan Pelissier, the head of Asia-Pacific for Airbus Defence and Space, also confirmed during a roundtable at the show that deliveries of Singapore’s six MRTTs have been completed.

The Smart MRTT will boast automatic air-to-air refuelling, or A3R, as well as enhanced maintenance solutions for the standard A330 tanker. Airbus says that its A3R system requires no additional equipment on the receiver and is intended to reduce air refuelling operator (ARO) workload, improve safety and optimize the rate of fuel transfer in operational conditions to maximise aerial superiority.

Once the A3R system is activated by the operator, the Boom Flight Control System becomes fully automated and progresses to transfer fuel upon contact with the receiver. During this process, the operator simply monitors the mission. In the event of an anomaly due to receiver stability deviations or malfunctions on the tanker, the A3R system is able to disconnect and clear the boom away from the receiver safely, according to Airbus.

RELATED

The pilot of the receiver aircraft closing in to the tanker will take visual cues from the automated Pilot Director Lights (PDL). This feature allows for more efficient operations, with smoother transitions, and minimizes time during the coupled state. Airbus expects A3R development to pave the way towards a fully autonomous aerial refuelling operation.

The Smart MRTT project was launched in 2017, with an A310 tanker belonging to Airbus making the first automated contact with a refuelling boom system in 2018. The A310 performed a total of seven automated contacts with an Australian MRTT as part of a joint study into how to add capability to the tanker.

Australia’s and Singapore’s involvement in the Smart MRTT project is another avenue of potential defense cooperation between both countries, which enjoy close military ties with each other. Singapore, which lacks adequate training areas at home, has an extensive military training footprint in Australia, training troops, helicopter and aircraft pilots there.

Both countries are also regular participants of bilateral and multilateral exercises, which include both air forces conducting air-to-air refuelling training with each other’s tankers and receiver aircraft.

Defense News understands this program will expand later this year, when Singapore’s Boeing F-15SG Eagle multi-role fighters are planned to carry out air-to-air refuelling from Australian MRTTs for the first time when both types take part in Exercise Pitch Black over northern Australia in August.

Airbus protests U.S. Navy helicopter trainer award to Leonardo - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 05 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLXByb3Rlc3RzLXUtcy1uYXZ5LWhlbGljb3B0ZXItdHJhaW5lci1hd2FyZC10by1sZW9uYXJkby_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters is formally protesting the U.S. Navy’s decision to have Leonardo Helicopters build its new training aircraft, halting production of the TH-73 for up to 100 days.

Airbus filed a protest with the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) on Feb. 3, arguing that its twin-engine H135 was not properly considered to replace the aging TH-57 Sea Ranger. The Navy now has 30 days to file a report on why it went with Leonardo.

The Navy chose Leonardo’s single-engine TH-119 in mid-January over the Airbus H135 and incumbent Bell’s 407GXi to replace the TH-57 on which all Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard pilots train. A Bell spokesperson told Vertical the company “will not protest the Navy’s decision at this time.”

Airbus says its twin-engine H135 was dismissed based on “technical misunderstandings.”

“While we respect the Navy’s right to choose the asset that best meets its needs, we believe that certain technical aspects of our proposal were not assessed accurately,” an Airbus spokesperson said in a statement emailed to Vertical. “We’re confident that when these technical misunderstandings have been clarified, the Navy will be reassured that the H135 is not only the best overall value for taxpayers, but also the most suitable aircraft for the mission. The H135 is a proven military trainer with more than 355,000 training flight hours logged by 10 U.S. allies around the world.”

The H135 stood out from the field as already certified to fly under instrument flight rules (IFR) when the program began, not to mention its twin Pratt & Whitney PW206B3 engines. The powerplants made the aircraft both heavier and more expensive than its competitors, but Airbus wagered it was a lower-risk option for basic rotorcraft training and more representative of the aircraft pilots would fly once they graduated to fleet operations.

Bell, which built the legacy TH-57 Sea Ranger, had not filed a protest with GAO Feb. 3. Losing bidders have 10 days to file a protest from the time they receive a Navy debrief on the contract award.

Leonardo is building the first 32 TH-119s under a $176-million contract, but the entire scope of work for 130 aircraft is worth nearly $650 million.

The company said the Navy ran a fair competition and stands by its TH-119 as a best-value training helicopter.

“Leonardo believes the U.S. Navy executed a thorough and competitively-bid procurement process for its TH-73 helicopter program, selecting the best-value Leonardo TH-119,” a Leonardo spokesperson said in a statement. “We remain committed to the Navy’s vital training mission and program timeline. ”

GAO has up to 100 days to consider both arguments and either dismiss or uphold the protest. Leonardo is unable to perform work under its contract until the issue is decided.

The protest could disrupt the Navy’s relatively swift procurement timeline for the TH-73 if allowed to drag for more than three months. The service’s prescribed schedule sees the first TH-73 delivered by the end of the year and a production schedule of three per month until its 130-aircraft fleet is fielded in 2024. Plans are to completely retire the TH-57 by 2023.

Airbus touted its twin-engine training aircraft as a low-risk platform with a modern glass cockpit, four-axis autopilot, integrated flight management system, and certified for instrument flight rules (IFR) operation.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9716089367866516}",neutral,0.9716089367866516,0
Airbus A320 With 172 Passengers On Board Nearly Hit By Syrian Air Defense During Israeli Raid - The Aviationist,"Fri, 07 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3RoZWF2aWF0aW9uaXN0LmNvbS8yMDIwLzAyLzA3L2FpcmJ1cy1hMzIwLXdpdGgtMTcyLXBhc3NlbmdlcnMtb24tYm9hcmQtbmVhcmx5LWhpdC1ieS1zeXJpYW4tYWlyLWRlZmVuc2UtZHVyaW5nLWlzcmFlbGktcmFpZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An A320 had to make an emergency landing at Khmeimim air base, in Syria, after Syrian air defense almost hit the airliner according to the Russian MoD.

News outlets around the world are reporting that an Airbus A320 with 172 passengers on board made an emergency landing in Russia-controlled Khmeimim air base after Syrian air defence nearly hit it. The first report appears to be sourced by Russian state news agency RIA citing Russian defence ministry spokesman.

#BREAKING: The Russian military said that Israel almost caused a civilian plane with 172 passengers to be hit during this week airstrike in Syria “after it used it to block retaliatory actions of the Syrian air defense forces” — Amichai Stein (@AmichaiStein1) February 7, 2020

Flightradar24.com historical database indeed confirms something occurred to Cham Wing Airlines flight 6Q514 / SAW514, an Airbus 320, registration YK-BAB, flying from Najaf, Iraq, to Damascus, Syria, on Feb. 6, 2020. The track (gathered via ADS-B) shows the aircraft approaching Damascus airport around 23.10 UTC, then diverting to Khmeimim air base, in northwestern Syria, near Latakia.

Based on reports, the A320 was diverted by the Damascus ATC (Air Traffic Control) as the Syrian air defense systems engaged four Israeli F-16s and was on high alert due to incoming missiles, and the civilian could have found itself in the crossfire.

According to Russia Today, the Russian Defense Ministry also added that using civilian aircraft as a “shield” is “commonplace” for Israeli Air Force pilots.

Tel Aviv is perfectly aware of civilian flight routes and air activity around Damascus, day and night, and such reckless missions prove that Israeli strategists could not care less about possible civilian casualties, Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov said. This is not the first time Israeli fighter jets have endangered civilian aircraft. Moscow criticized Tel Aviv for putting two passenger flights landing at Beirut and Damascus airports in danger during an air raid in 2018. Israel has flown hundreds of similar bombing raids on Syria throughout the country’s civil war, claiming to be hitting “legitimate Iranian targets.”

Yet again, as often explained in the past, suggestions that four attacking jets can use a large and slower aircraft as “shield” during an air strike seem tactically implausible or at least extremely complex (BTW, it might not be even necessary at all, considered the IAF can use stand-off munitions as done almost always.) Nevertheless, deconfliction over a busy target area is a problem in aerial combat that dates back to WWI, as is the corresponding threat of fratricide from anti-aircraft fire.

What happened yesterday has something in common with another incident occurred over Syria, during an Israeli air strike, in 2018, involving a Russian spypale. Syrian anti-aircraft batteries were attempting to engage four Israeli F-16s that were striking targets in the region and a Syrian S-200 surface to air missiles accidentally hit the larger, slower Russian Air Force Il-20M surveillance plane instead of any of the attacking Israeli F-16s (and possible escorting aircraft).

Here’s what we wrote commenting the Il-20M Coot-A downing in an article here at The Aviationist:

As you will proobably remember, another tragic incident involving a civilian aircraft occurred earlier this year, in January, when the Iranian air defenses shot down Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737 flight PS752.

There were 176 passengers and crew on board Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752 when it was accidentally shot down on Jan. 8, 2020, by the Iranians. There were no survivors in the crash. Reports say 82 passengers were Iranian, 63 were Canadian citizens, 11 were Ukrainian, 10 from Sweden, 4 from Afghanistan, 3 from Germany and 3 from the United Kingdom.

The civilian airliner was engaged by an active air defense system “Due to ‘human error’. A statement from the military on Iranian state media said that the plane was mistaken for a “hostile target,” adding that forces were at the “highest level of readiness” at the time, according to the AP.

Anyway, the latest incident is just a reminder that flying close or within conflict/crisis zones can be extremely dangerous (as explained in this article with a history of the civilian shoot down incidents).

The company's entire management has stepped down over the charges.

European aircraft manufacturer Airbus on Thursday reported billions in losses for 2019 after being hit with heavy fines related to corruption and bribery allegations.

The Toulouse-based manufacturer reported a net loss of €1.36 billion ($1.49 billion) for the 2019 fiscal year.

Airbus had reported net profits of €3 billion in 2018.

It is the aerospace and defense giant's first net loss since 2009.

Allegations of bribes for contracts

Airbus had agreed to fines of €3.6 billion after being subject to bribery and corruption investigations related to dealings in France, Britain, and the US between 2004 and 2016.

Investigations began in 2016 following a voluntary disclosure by the company. Authorities had investigated allegations that bribes were paid in exchange for contracts for the sale of civilian aircraft and satellites.

The entire upper management team has since stepped down.

Airbus also revised down its expections for exports of its A400M military transport aircraft, incurring further costs €1.2 billion on its bottom line in 2019.

Airbus said it plans to deliver around 880 commercial planes in 2020 versus 863 in 2019.
