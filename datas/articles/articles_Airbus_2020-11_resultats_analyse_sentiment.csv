"Hydrogen combustion, explained - Airbus","Thu, 26 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIwLTExLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLWNvbWJ1c3Rpb24tZXhwbGFpbmVk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Today’s internal combustion engines in aircraft can be modified to run on alternative fuels for improved environmental performance. Now, hydrogen combustion—either via gas or liquid—is emerging as one of the most promising options in this respect. Airbus is exploring the technology’s potential in preparation for its zero-emission aircraft programme.

When the world’s first internal combustion engine revved up, it was hydrogen gas—not gasoline or diesel—that burned as its fuel.

The year was 1804. After successfully designing several steam-powered carriages, Franco-Swiss inventor Isaac de Rivaz set his sights on using an explosive charge—instead of steam—inside a stationary engine to power a pump. His first experiments focused on creating an explosion within the engine’s cylinder to drive the piston out. At the time, he used a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gases to ignite this explosion—and it worked. By 1807, de Rivaz’s experimental prototype engine was being used to propel a carriage a short distance—thereby garnering the distinction as the world’s first vehicle driven by an internal combustion engine.

Throughout the 20th century, automobile companies, universities, inventors and hobbyists alike further tested the viability of internal combustion engines powered by hydrogen. In fact, in 1970, inventor Paul Dieges was the first to patent a modification to gas-powered internal combustion engines, which enabled them to run on hydrogen.

Today, hydrogen combustion engines have proven their ability to successfully power a variety of vehicles, from cars to buses. Tomorrow, hydrogen combustion may just power future commercial aircraft.

Hydrogen combustion: how does it work?

Combustion, or burning, is a chemical process that involves releasing energy from a fuel and air mixture. In the case of hydrogen combustion, liquid or gaseous hydrogen is burned in a modified gas-turbine engine to generate thrust. This process is identical to traditional internal combustion, except hydrogen replaces its fossil fuel counterpart.

Consisting of a fixed cylinder and one or more moving pistons, a spark ignition engine works in the following way:

During the intake process, fuel is mixed with air and introduced into the cylinder.

The piston then compresses the fuel-air mixture, which is ignited by a spark. Ignition results in combustion.

The expanding combustion gases drive the piston, which rotates the crankshaft.

This rotational motion turns the wheels, in the case of automobiles.

The only way to determine which hydrogen technology is best-placed to fuel our ZEROe concept aircraft is to test, test, test.

Matthieu Thomas, ZEROe Aircraft Lead Architect

Hydrogen has many unique properties that make it suitable for combustion, including the following:

Wide flammability range: Hydrogen can be combusted via a wide range of fuel-air mixtures. In fact, hydrogen can run on a “lean” mixture, which means the amount of fuel is less than the amount needed for combustion with a given amount of air. This results in greater fuel economy and a final combustion temperature that is generally lower, which reduces the amount of pollutants, such as NOx, emitted via the exhaust.

Hydrogen can be combusted via a wide range of fuel-air mixtures. In fact, hydrogen can run on a “lean” mixture, which means the amount of fuel is less than the amount needed for combustion with a given amount of air. This results in greater fuel economy and a final combustion temperature that is generally lower, which reduces the amount of pollutants, such as NOx, emitted via the exhaust. High auto-ignition temperature: Hydrogen’s high auto-ignition temperature enables higher compression ratios in a hydrogen engine compared to a hydrocarbon engine. A higher compression ratio results in greater thermal efficiency, or less energy loss during combustion.

Putting hydrogen combustion technology to the test

Hydrogen combustion has already been used to fuel aircraft. In fact, in 1988, the world’s first experimental commercial aircraft operating on liquid hydrogen (and later, liquefied natural gas) took to the skies: the Tupolev Tu-155. It flew approximately 100 test flights and was then placed into storage.

Now, more than 30 years later, the aviation industry is once again turning its attention to hydrogen combustion in commercial aircraft. Indeed, Airbus’ ZEROe concept aircraft could run on hydrogen combustion. To explore the possibilities and limitations of this technology for commercial aircraft, Airbus will team up with a variety of partners across industries.

“The only way to determine which hydrogen technology is best-placed to fuel our ZEROe concept aircraft is to test, test, test,” says Matthieu Thomas, ZEROe Aircraft Lead Architect. “We look forward to sharing more details about an exciting cross-industry partnership on hydrogen combustion.”

But for hydrogen combustion to work, liquid hydrogen must be stored safely and securely on board aircraft. Due to hydrogen’s unique properties, this can be tricky. For example, tanks need to be insulated to avoid evaporation if heat is carried over into the stored content by factors such as conduction. This is why the Airbus Defence and Space’s Engineering Division has stepped in to help. The team will provide support for the development and industrialisation of cryogenic tanks for liquid hydrogen storage in a three-year project collaboration with the ZEROe programme team.

“The space industry has been using pressure vessels for the storage of liquid propellant to fuel space exploration for decades,” explains Renato Bellarosa, Head of Propulsion Products and Tanks at Airbus Defence and Space. “So we have a lot of expertise in damage tolerance, in advanced manufacturing technologies and in vessel pressure testing, all of which is key to supporting the development of liquid hydrogen storage tanks for future aircraft propulsion systems. It’s cross-industry collaboration like this that will bring us closer to putting a hydrogen-powered aircraft into the skies over the next decade.”

"Airbus hopes its $6.5 billion German Eurofighter sale will shine for Switzerland, Finland - Defense News","Thu, 12 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWZlbnNlbmV3cy5jb20vZ2xvYmFsL2V1cm9wZS8yMDIwLzExLzEyL2FpcmJ1cy1ob3Blcy1pdHMtNjUtYmlsbGlvbi1nZXJtYW4tZXVyb2ZpZ2h0ZXItc2FsZS13aWxsLXNoaW5lLWZvci1zd2l0emVybGFuZC1maW5sYW5kL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"COLOGNE, Germany — Airbus is trying to make hay out of its $6.5 billion sale of 38 Eurofighter aircraft to Germany for other procurement competitions in Switzerland and Finland.

The European defense giant inked a deal with the German Luftwaffe, or Air Force, this week after the country’s parliament, the Bundestag, approved the budget earlier this month. The Luftwaffe stands to get 30 single-seater and eight twin-seater planes, Airbus said in a statement.

Four of those aircraft will serve as test beds for future technology, as the company positions the Eurofighter as the bridge to the next-generation Future Combat Air System, a German-French-Spanish collaboration, according to the service.

“The renewed order from Germany secures production until 2030 and comes at a strategically important time for the program,” the company statement read. “In addition to an expected Eurofighter order from Spain to replace its legacy F-18s, procurement decisions in Switzerland and Finland are imminent in 2021.”

Switzerland wants to buy up to 40 aircraft for a maximum of $6.5 billion, and the Eurofighter is one of the aircraft in the running. Similarly, Finland is considering the plane as a replacement for its F-18 fleet.

“The variant offered in Switzerland corresponds to the configuration of the German Quadriga order,” Airbus officials wrote in the statement, referring to the name of a new, fourth tranche of aircraft.

The new batch, to be delivered by 2030, will replace the first tranche, bought between 2003 and 2008, which can only do air-to-air combat and boasts an obsolete radar, according to the German Defence Ministry.

Voters in Switzerland approved a new air defense package in September, including a ground-based weapon system and a fleet of combat aircraft. A second offer from the four competing companies is expected this month. Besides the Eurofighter, Dassault’s Rafale, Boeing’s F-18 Super Hornet and Lockheed Martin’s F-35 also are under consideration.

The Finnish government over the summer upped the budget for its “HX” fighter program to $5.8 billion, eyeing a procurement decision in 2021.

“The new Tranche 4 Eurofighter is currently the most modern European-built combat aircraft with a service life well beyond 2060,” Airbus Defence and Space CEO Dirk Hoke said in a statement following the contract signature with the German government. “Its technical capabilities will allow full integration into the European Future Combat Air System, FCAS.”

Airbus Jet Sale Highlights Tensions With Former Close Friend AirAsia - Skift Travel News,"Sat, 28 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMjAvMTEvMjgvYWlyYnVzLWpldC1zYWxlLWhpZ2hsaWdodHMtdGVuc2lvbnMtd2l0aC1mb3JtZXItY2xvc2UtZnJpZW5kLWFpcmFzaWEv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly9za2lmdC5jb20vMjAyMC8xMS8yOC9haXJidXMtamV0LXNhbGUtaGlnaGxpZ2h0cy10ZW5zaW9ucy13aXRoLWZvcm1lci1jbG9zZS1mcmllbmQtYWlyYXNpYS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"AirAsia will remain an important Airbus customer, but there's nothing like a pandemic and depressed travel demand to really test a partnership.

Airbus has found buyers for six aircraft from the A320neo family rejected by one of its main customers, Malaysia’s AirAsia, as it works off a surplus left by the coronavirus crisis, industry sources said.

Unwanted jets have become an emblem of pandemic-induced problems in the aerospace industry that have come on top of a chill in ties between two of its major players.

Tensions became unusually public when Airbus in April invited tenders for six jets that AirAsia had failed to take delivery of.

It has now found homes for all six, the last of which is being delivered this month, a European industry source told Reuters. Airbus provided no comment.

Airbus has been steadily increasing deliveries as it strikes deals with airlines to reschedule deliveries or store jets.

It said last month it had reduced an overhang that it had been unable to deliver during the crisis by 10 units to 135 jets. The redeployment of AirAsia orders is expected to trim the surplus further as deliveries top output in November.

Airbus is seeing strong demand, relative to the rest of the battered sector, for its A321neo jet, and the aircraft has broadly held its value, the European source said. It is sticking with plans to increase output of the single-aisle jets.

The A321neo competes with the two largest versions of the Boeing 737 MAX, which won approval last week to re-enter service after a 20-month grounding in the wake of two crashes.

Aircraft Values

Boeing is expected to re-sell dozens of 737 MAX whose buyers cancelled during the grounding, potentially depressing prices.

According to the UK-based consultancy IBA Group, all aircraft have lost some value during the COVID-19 crisis but the A321neo is trading around 5% below its inherent value while the MAX is 10% below – hurt also by the recent grounding.

Doubts remain, however, about demand for a larger Airbus, the A330neo, whose largest customer, AirAsia’s long-haul unit Air Asia X, is seeking new funding to survive.

AirAsia said in April it would stop taking deliveries of all Airbus jets this year and review remaining orders.

The move exacerbated concerns about demand in Southeast Asia, which was already struggling with overcapacity before the crisis.

AirAsia’s relations with Airbus were further clouded when it was drawn into an Airbus bribery case before being cleared by local investigators, industry sources have said.

AirAsia co-founders denied any wrongdoing in a sports sponsorship deal cited in a wider Airbus bribery settlement with prosecutors in January. The European source said AirAsia remained an important partner for Airbus.

Airbus supersalesman blames engines for A380 failure - Airline Ratings,"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyYXRpbmdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1zdXBlcnNhbGVzbWFuLWJsYW1lcy1lbmdpbmVzLWEzODAtZmFpbHVyZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus supersalesman John Leahy has broken his silence to speak out about the failure of the A380 superjumbo that passengers love. In a two-part series, Mr. Leahy speaks exclusively to Airlineratings.com

John Leahy, in retirement since early 2018, is an aviation legend and seen as the ultimate aircraft salesman.

Leahy, now 70, led a sales team that sold over 15,000 aircraft in his career, “after cancellations”, as he recently revealed in an exclusive interview with Airlineratings.com.

Hailing from New York, a former flight instructor with almost 4,000 hours under his belt, Leahy launched his sales career with the European planemaker in 1985 at Airbus North America.

He was tasked with prying open the US market for Airbus, which was entirely locked out of it at the time, and Leahy delivered. In 1994, he moved to Airbus’ Toulouse headquarters and became the charismatic head of the Airbus sales force.

READ: Qatar Airways soars with 100 destinations

READ: In the COVID-19 world there is more danger en route to the airport.

He remained in this role until the end of 2017 and saw five different Airbus CEOs during his time and seven counterparts of his at Boeing. It was his ambition that won Airbus over 50 per cent market share regularly from 1999.

The A380, the world’s biggest passenger aircraft, was a model particularly close to Leahy’s heart. He even postponed his retirement, planned for the end of 2017, to personally secure a crucial follow-up order with Emirates and thus the ongoing production of the A380.

It came to fruition only in early 2018, before it unraveled after he went into retirement, with the A380 seeing its last new ones delivered to Emirates at some time in 2021.

John Leahy today lives in Miami, Florida. In this exclusive interview with Airlineratings.com, Leahy talks for the first time about the failure of the A380 program.

Are you bored now, not having any constant suspense anymore?

John Leahy: I am keeping myself busy over here in retirement, but Airbus is going through a quieter period right now with all the airlines hunkering down, not doing much.

Are you feeling you left Airbus at the right time before the pandemic disaster hit the industry?

A lot of people say that, but I think it’s just the opposite. I like a challenge, I enjoy sorting things out. After 9/11 it was fun to get through 2008 to 2010, helping the airlines when they were in distress due to SARS out of China and the financial crisis. For me, a challenge is more interesting than just a day-to-day normal activity.

How big a challenge was the A380 in your entire career?

The A380 was certainly a big challenge from a commercial point of view. Airlines interfered with the design. Singapore Airlines said they wouldn’t sign on if the A380 wouldn’t be meeting London’s QC2 noise standard. That meant extra weight with the re-designs that were necessary. Too much weight was built into the airplane, which was a design-philosophic mistake that is, thinking we would do a stretched A380-900. We should have put in a structure that was needed now. They also put in extra weight because they wanted a freighter. But the optimal freighters are the ones that don’t have any extra weight. That was clearly a design-mistake that we have made. I was talking to Qantas in 1999, and they finally said they needed guarantees the A380 would get from Sydney to Los Angeles, while, for example, Emirates didn’t need as much performance from the aircraft initially. It was only later they discovered they also needed more range and payload. We were getting pushed back and forth by different airlines. At least the airlines know how to compromise back and forth. In 2000, we ultimately started listening to the customers.

When did the problems with the A380 start to emerge?

Where I believe we got into serious trouble was when we were blindsided by the engine manufacturers. They were assuring us that the specific fuel consumption was that of new generation engines, and it would be ten years before there was the next leap to a substantial improvement. We launched in 2000, but three years later we got the 787 being launched with GENx engines and Rolls-Royce matching that, having a ten to 12 per cent better specific fuel consumption than the A380’s engines. Can you imagine the success of the A380 if it had 12 per cent better fuel burn than it actually had?

Would that have made the A380 a success then?

That would have solved all sorts of problems. With the long lead times new engines take, they had to know they were developing a new generation of engines for Boeing that was going to come out. All our engineers were blindsided. That’s why we stumbled around on the A350 in the very beginning when we had no idea they could do a 787 with a ten, twelve or even 15 per cent better fuel economy and a new series of engines being available. And that was all announced before we started flight-testing the A380.

Did you ever raise this point with the engine manufacturers later?

Yes, but they were all shuffling around about it. People said: “Well I wasn’t involved, we thought Boeing would do the Sonic Cruiser and that there’ll be a different engine, and then they decided to go subsonic with the 787 and we had this new series of engines.” They indeed had this new series of engines, and it wasn’t just GE, it was Rolls-Royce, too. So both competitors, on both sides of the Atlantic, had something in their back pocket that was ten, twelve or maybe 15 per cent better in fuel economy than the A380. That would have been game-changing, had we just waited two or three years and put that on the A380. If should have done a better job of prying out from the engine manufacturers what they had in their back pockets in terms of technology that would become available. We were saying at first that the airplane would be delivered in 2005, maybe that was also unrealistic.

When did you as the salesman believe a commercially successful A380 was possible?

I believed it was possible at the beginning, in 1999/2000. That’s why I was working with the airlines to launch it and I was getting good feedback. They liked the airplane. They knew the 747 was old and a new generation was coming, and they wanted to be on board with it. So yes, at the very beginning I thought we had it. When the 787 came out and their engines delivered the specific fuel consumption that they had, I was beginning to worry. And I was worried when they brought out the 747-8. Had we had those engines at that point in time, I knew that would have protected us from the big twins. As it was, the A380, even with the disadvantage of the engine technology, if you could fill it up to 85 or 95 per cent load factor, the big twins couldn’t compete with you. But that’s a pretty tight margin in a big airplane that’s getting harder to fill up. Had we had that better fuel burn, on a 65 or 70 per cent load factor you could have done very well with the A380.

This shortfall, together with the delayed entry into service right at the start of the world financial crisis in 2008, was the worst possible timing, no?

It was the perfect storm. Had we had it out in 2005 like we said we were going to or even had it been delivered with better fuel economy in 2007 with new generation engines, it would have been before the financial crisis. It would have had the momentum of building fleets up and getting things going. But as it was, airlines were building up fleets right during a financial crisis, when business travel was way down, hurting them financially. When financing was difficult, the brand new largest aircraft in the world made financing even more difficult. Yes, that extra two to three years delay in the program became deadly in itself. The lack of competitiveness with the engine fuel burn was also part of the perfect storm. And then of course the next thing it got hit with was the fuel prices that became very, very deadly. It all started lining up at the same time.

And then passengers didn’t want to fly via big hubs anymore, opposite to what you had always predicted…

People say more point-to-point was the way of the future. It became the way of the future as you could do it economically against the big airplanes like the A380 and Boeing 747 because now you had better fuel consumption. All in all, fuel prices hurt us, the engines manufacturers hurt us by giving us the wrong generation engine, and we committed suicide with not being able to technologically build the airplane we then had to redesign it and bring it out a couple of years later, right in the middle of the financial crisis.

Which role did the internal struggles at Airbus play in dooming the A380, which became apparent in a key phase of the project?

That played a key part in how screwed up it became. How can you manage a company as big and as sophisticated as Airbus, when you build wire harnesses that are just a few centimeters too short? You just don’t expect that from Boeing or Airbus. How could the Germans be sitting there in their own little world in Hamburg, the French in their walled city in Toulouse, and having clearly not talking to each other? How could you have gone right to the end of your design phase, having already manufactured these wiring harnesses, you’ve built the airplane, and now for the first time you are trying to connect them, and the workmen say: Hey, they don’t fit, guys? How could that happen? It was just dysfunctional.

PART 11 Tuesday 24th November: Leahy’s belief in the A380s starts to crumble.

Andreas Spaeth will be publishing a book looking back on the program titled “A380 – the last giant” (initially in German) in March 2021.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995211362838745}",neutral,0.9995211362838745,0
Airbus keen to play key role in 'European answer' to new NATO rotorcraft program - Vertical Magazine,"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWtlZW4tdG8tcGxheS1rZXktcm9sZS1pbi1ldXJvcGVhbi1hbnN3ZXItdG8tbmV3LW5hdG8tcm90b3JjcmFmdC1wcm9ncmFtL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters CEO Bruno Even says the OEM “should play a key role” in a recently-announced program to develop Next-Generation Rotorcraft Capabilities signed by five NATO member countries.

France, Germany, Greece, Italy and the United Kingdom announced the launch of the program on Nov. 19.

One of NATO’s “high visibility projects,” it seeks to develop a replacement for medium multirole helicopters currently in operation that are expected to reach the end of their lifecycle around 2035 to 2040.

“I’m convinced that there should be a European answer,” Even told journalists during a recent conference call. “I’m convinced that we have the competencies, the capability in Europe, to answer to the requirement and the need of our European customers.”

The program echoes the origin of the NHIndustries NH90, which was developed collaboratively by Airbus Helicopters, Leonardo Helicopters, and Fokker Aerostructures in response to a NATO requirement for a medium multi-role helicopter.

“We like to come at open level, which means that as we did with NH90, Airbus Helicopters should play a key role, but should also be ready to partner, and to cooperate for such a future European program,” said Even.

“I think it’s fair to consider that there should be a European answer, not only because we have the competence and the capability . . . but it’s also a question of [the] strategic autonomy of Europe.”

Over 420 NH90s have been delivered to 18 customers in 13 countries — including France, Germany, Greece and Italy.

However, Even said he did not see the newly-announced program necessarily providing a replacement to the NH90 itself.

“The need could be also to complement some of the [customer fleets’] existing capability — the NH90, Tiger and so on — which will continue to fly through 2040/2050,” he said. “The need could be to complement these platforms/programs with a new type of architecture in order to bring a new capability, either in terms of autonomy, connectivity, speed, [or] range.”

Experts from the five participant nations are to meet to define a statements of requirements and a multi-phase cooperation plan, beginning a multi-year program of work.

“I think it’s good to see that reflection not only for short- or medium-, but also for long-term requirements,” said Even.

“As an industry, you need this long-term view on the evolution of the requirement in order to have time not only to mature technologies, but also to mature [the] architecture, and to be in position to launch the program when the need will be there.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999967098236084}",neutral,0.999967098236084,0
Imagine travelling in this blended wing body aircraft - Airbus,"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIwLTExLWltYWdpbmUtdHJhdmVsbGluZy1pbi10aGlzLWJsZW5kZWQtd2luZy1ib2R5LWFpcmNyYWZ00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The next generation of single-aisle aircraft has a lot to learn from MAVERIC, Airbus’ latest aircraft demonstrator. The game-changing “blended wing body” design could generate up to 20% fuel savings and significantly improve the passenger experience thanks to its exceptionally spacious cabin layout.

The conventional tube-and-wing configuration with wing-mounted engines: it is the iconic aircraft shape that has captured the imagination of aviation enthusiasts for decades. But someday soon, passengers may find themselves travelling in an aircraft that looks nothing like the ones seen on today’s runways.

So what if that future aircraft looked like a giant flying wing?

This is the concept behind MAVERIC, an aircraft demonstrator unveiled at Singapore Air Show 2020. The innovative design—known as a “blended wing body”—is a complete departure from traditional aircraft architecture thanks to a wide cabin layout that completely breaks the mould of conventional single-aisle aircraft. In fact, the design is so radical, some engineers did not believe in its potential at first.

At Airbus, we understand society expects more from us in terms of improving the environmental performance of our aircraft. MAVERIC’s blended wing body configuration is a potential game-changer in this respect, and we’re keen to push the technology to the limit.

- Adrien Bérard, MAVERIC Project Co-Leader

“Initially, many dismissed the MAVERIC project as merely a ‘hobby,’ or, in other words, a project Airbus wouldn’t learn very much from,” explains Adrien Bérard, MAVERIC Project Co-Leader. “So we had to prove them wrong by showing that we could deliver a very sound basis for future aircraft configuration.”

And the ten-person MAVERIC project team, part of the Flight Lab team within Airbus UpNext in Toulouse, did just that. In less than three years, the MAVERIC concept went from a simple sketch to a 3D computer-generated model to an aircraft demonstrator. In June 2019, the remote-controlled demonstrator took to the skies for the first time.

MAVERIC, blended wing body aircraft demonstrator

AIRBUS VNR MAVERIC VIDEO show more show less Airbus has revealed MAVERIC (Model Aircraft for Validation and Experimentation of Robust Innovative Controls) its “blended wing body” scale model technological demonstrator.



At 2 metres long and 3.2 metres wide, with a surface area of about 2.25m², MAVERIC features a disruptive aircraft design, that has the potential to reduce fuel consumption by up-to 20 percent compared to current single-aisle aircraft. The “blended wing body” configuration also opens up new possibilities for propulsion systems type and integration, as well as a versatile cabin for a totally new on-board passenger experience.



Launched in 2017, MAVERIC first took to the skies in June 2019. Since then the flight-test campaign has been on-going and will continue until the end of Q2 2020.



Pushing new aircraft design to the limit

At 2 metres long and 3 metres wide, MAVERIC is a small-scale, remote-controlled aircraft demonstrator. The development of demonstrators like MAVERIC enables Airbus to accelerate understanding of new aircraft configurations and to mature the technology necessary to fly such a radically different aircraft.

In fact, the MAVERIC demonstrator has been built with the same precision as other Airbus aircraft. For example, wind tunnel testing to verify MAVERIC’s aerodynamic characteristics was conducted—like all other Airbus aircraft—at Airbus’ Filton site in the UK. These types of tests help to better identify and analyse technical challenges.

One specific challenge was to assess the low-speed and stall dynamics. Future testing will analyse aspects such as MAVERIC’s handling qualities, flight control, multi-objective control surfaces and modularity.

Improving environmental performance & the passenger experience

For Airbus, the demonstrator’s potential to deliver real environmental performance benefits is of significant interest: approximately 20% less fuel burn compared to current single-aisle models with the same engine. The spacious configuration also opens up the design space, enabling the possible integration of various other types of propulsion systems. In addition, noise is expected to be significantly reduced thanks to a “shielded” engine that is mounted above the central body.

And, if commercialised, a MAVERIC-inspired aircraft could significantly improve the passenger experience. A blended wing body design provides an exceptionally comfortable cabin layout, enabling passengers to benefit from additional legroom and larger aisles for more personal comfort.

“At Airbus, we understand society expects more from us in terms of improving the environmental performance of our aircraft,” explains Adrien. “MAVERIC’s blended wing body configuration is a potential game-changer in this respect, and we’re keen to push the technology to the limit.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8305371403694153}",positive,0.8305371403694153,1

Company CEO Bruno Even called the Mark III program a “key milestone” in extending the life of the aircraft, currently in service with France, Germany, Spain and Australia, to beyond 2040.

Airbus has been working closely with the three European customers on the composition of the Mark III upgrade, which will include new avionics, mission and weapon systems.

“There are close technical discussions, and the objective is to converge [on the configuration] by the end of the year,” he said during a media conference call.

Even added that “depending on the customer, there could be a slight difference,” in each nation’s aircraft, but that the core of the upgrade would be the same.

“In addition to this extension of the life of the program, it will for sure bring additional capabilities,” he said.

The Tiger was first deployed by the French Army in Afghanistan in 2009, and Airbus Helicopter has now delivered over 180 of the type.

In other Airbus Helicopters military news, the company is hoping to complete a set of feasibility studies for the military version of the H160 for the French armed forces by the end of 2020/early 2021.

The H160M, also called the Guépard (Cheetah), has been selected for the French joint light helicopter program, which will see the type fulfill a range of roles for the French army, navy and air force, replacing hundreds of medium and light helicopters. First deliveries are due in 2026.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9988393187522888}",neutral,0.9988393187522888,0
Cockpit communication | FAST Online | News - Airbus Aircraft,"Mon, 09 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vYWlyY3JhZnQuYWlyYnVzLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzcm9vbS9uZXdzLzIwMjAtMTEtY29ja3BpdC1jb21tdW5pY2F0aW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A new digital audio cockpit system will bring significant improvements to pilots and aircraft operations compared to current analogue audio. The Digital Radio and Audio Integrating Management System (DRAIMS) received EASA certification* in March 2020 for the A320 Family.

Airbus is working towards similar certification for the A330 Family and studying potential installation on the A350 Family. The digital audio system will become the baseline for A320 and A330 Family aircraft over the next few years.

Here we look at the changes to the aircraft systems architecture linked to the installation of digital audio, what benefits it brings and the different operating modes from a flight crew perspective.

Customer Experience

Testimonies from Captain Dan Wood, Flight Operations Technical Manager and Martin Delahaye, Assistant Technical Pilot who are are coordinating the digital audio implementation at EasyJet.

It’s a definite improvement from the previous RMP. Pilots have fed back that the audio quality is significantly better. They are also happy with the brightness control during night flights.

Captain Dan Wood, Flight Operations Technical Manager

Most comments [from crews] relate to the appreciation of the in-ear RAD ALT [auto call-outs] and ECAM [warnings and cautions] plus clear audio quality.

Martin Delahaye, Assistant Technical Pilot

Understanding the digital audio system

Although the audio system peripherals (radios, boomsets, headsets, interfaced computers such as FWS, TCAS & GPWS, ….) have evolved and improved significantly over the years, the core elements of the audio system on A320 and A330 Family aircraft have remained essentially unchanged since the initial type certification of those aircraft types.

In the legacy architecture, the heart of the system, the Audio Management Unit (AMU), is connected to all peripheral equipment using multiple analogue links. Additional standalone computers such as the Cockpit Amplified Loudspeaker, the Audio Mixing box and the SELCAL box, perform functions not included in the AMU. The Human Machine Interface (HMI) is principally based on two separate control panels, the Radio Management Panel (RMP) and the Audio Control Panel (ACP). There is some limited synchronisation between RMPs, and in case of system failure requiring reconfiguration, the flight crew need to intervene manually (AUDIO SWITCHING control).

The digital audio system is designed to:

improve and streamline the architecture, simplifying installation and increasing robustness

update the HMI to bring it into line with solutions available on the A350 and A380

increase synchronisation and simplify operating procedures to reduce crew workload

integrate additional functions and provide provisions for future upgrades

improve aircraft dispatch capability and remove some airline maintenance tasks

Improving and streamlining the architecture

The AMU has a completely new design. It now includes some of the previously external computers (such as the SELCAL box) and has a dual channel configuration with internal reconfiguration capability to improve robustness. Wherever it is technically feasible, links are now digital between the AMU and the peripheral equipment. Now, the RMPs (and not the AMU) manage the boomsets, headsets, hand microphones, oxygen mask microphones and loudspeakers. The power supply has been updated with dual power supply for RMP and AMU to ensure higher levels of equipment and function availability in the case of degraded electrical configurations.

The digital audio system is compatible with all peripheral equipment in the Airbus catalogue. This covers VHF, HF, SATCOM, boomsets (including those with a noise reduction function), headsets, TCAS and transponders.

Modernising the interface for the crew

Previously there were 3 separate panels: the Radio Management Panel, Audio Control Panel and XPDR/TCAS Control Panel

Now the RMP, ACP and XPDR/TCAS CP are combined into a new single control panel known as the RMP (Radio and Audio Management Panel)

The RMP builds on the service-proven design from the A380 and A350, but takes into account the desire to implement new functions, as well as the physical installation constraints of the A320 and A330 cockpits. Different cockpit layouts are available according to operators’ needs: 2 RMP + 1 ACP, 3 RMP or 3 RMP + ACP. The RMP has a single part number and can be programmed such that the HMI is coherent with the installed equipment. For example, if the aircraft is not equipped with an HF radio, then the associated menu key and transmissions keys will not be illuminated and pressing on those keys will have no effect. Some functions are controlled via a Line Select Key (LSK) and the RMP software can be programmed to give access, or not, as required (for example, CPDLC LOAD function), or to accurately reflect the aircraft configuration (for example, STBY NAV function and NAVAIDS listening).

Increasing synchronisation and simplifying operating procedures

Some of the main changes are explained below, with further details provided in the section “digital audio operating modes from a flight crew perspective”:

The RMP allows the pilot to see at a glance the active and standby frequencies selected for all the installed radios of each type (up to 3 VHF radios, 2 HF radios and single or dual channel SATCOM installations). The SEL indicator has been deleted.

All information is now fully synchronized between all RMPs in the cockpit. This includes active and standby frequencies of all installed radios, and STBY NAV tuning.

Shortcut keys have been implemented for the squawk codes and the principal operating modes of the TCAS.

Alerts from the FWS, TCAS and GPWS are broadcast through the boomsets and headsets, in addition to the loudspeakers.

Failure case management has been simplified and the appropriate procedures are available in the FWS; for example, in case of RMP failure, the single action of switching off the associated RMP automatically activates the reconfiguration onto the remaining available HMI (RMP or ACP).

Integrating additional functions

The RMP now incorporates the controls for the TCAS and transponder, which allows for the dedicated control panel for those systems to be removed.

For compatible SATCOM solutions (currently under development), the RMP now allows control of the dialing, directory functions and system settings, as opposed to them being hosted in the MCDU for legacy SATCOM solutions.

The RMP has spare keys and adequate processing power to be able to add new functions as and when they become available.

Improving aircraft dispatch capability and alleviating airline maintenance

The digital audio system has advantages in terms of installation, maintenance and operations:

Nearly 4kg of weight reduction per aircraft due to wiring simplification and harness diameter reduction.

Nearly 4kg of weight reduction per aircraft due to the reduced number and size of LRU, thus contributing to fuel savings.

Power consumption reduction of up to 26% (according to installation configuration).

Data-loading capability for future evolutions, avoiding equipment removals for retrofit.

Removal of scheduled maintenance tasks, due to increased reliability.

Single AMU and RMP hardware part numbers for reduced inventory, instead of different part numbers depending on equipment installed on aircraft.

Improved audio quality and reduced interference and background noise due to the use of digital communications protocol.

High level of commonality between A320, A330, A350 and A380 audio system HMIs.

Reduced crew workload thanks to intuitive HMI, fully synchronised information and simplified failure case management.

Digital audio operating modes from a flight crew perspective

Once an aircraft is out of service the likelihood of issues caused by the wear and tear of routine flying is reduced. Nevertheless, without proper protection a host of new threats to the condition of the aircraft can emerge depending on the climate and conditions the aircraft is stored in. Weather can cause problems. If rain, snow, salty air, dust or sand enter air ducts, they can degrade or contaminate the mechanical parts they come into contact with. Extremely high winds can also cause damage to an aircraft that might be considered safe and stable in normal circumstances. High humidity, lightning strikes and volcanic ash also require special consideration.

Protection against unwelcome ‘passengers’ is also vital. It only takes weeks for rodents, birds and insects to cause serious damage to a previously pristine cabin with seats, carpets and wiring all vulnerable particularly if a nest is established. Returning to service without an expensive and time-consuming deep-clean and repair operation is unthinkable. In extreme cases, infestation can also lead to blocked ducts, some of which could have safety repercussions – again thorough checks and remedial actions take time so avoiding the problem is the best solution.

RMP general presentation

The RMP contains the following elements:

A full colour display, with a brightness controller, which can also be used to switch off the RMP if required by procedure or for maintenance purposes. The brightness and colour of the keys and knobs on the RMP is harmonised with the other control panels in the cockpit and is controlled with the cockpit integrated lighting commands.

Menu keys, used to access the different pages for display. According to the aircraft configuration, only the relevant keys will be illuminated.

Line Select Keys (LSK) which have different functions according to the page being used: switching between active and standby frequencies/codes (VHF, HF, squawk code), cycling through operating modes (TCAS, transponder), accessing sub-menus (STBY NAV, SATCOM SETTINGS, …), clearing messages (CALL RESET, information messages, …).

Shortcut keys for control of the most common operating modes of TCAS. Each press of the shortcut key cycles through the available modes according to the flight phase.

A numeric keypad for entering or correcting frequencies, telephone numbers, squawk codes, ….

Up/down keys for scrolling in applicable fields on different pages.

A Push-to-talk switch (“PTT”) for performing interphone or external communications.

Transmission keys for all available audio channels. According to the aircraft configuration, only the relevant keys will be illuminated.

Reception knobs for all available audio channels, including NAVAIDS.

VHF and HF pages

The VHF and HF pages show the active and standby frequencies, or DATA if selected, on all available radios. The squawk code and TCAS shortcuts remain displayed.

Standby frequencies are entered by selecting the relevant LSK on the right hand side (cyan box appears) and using the numeric keypad. A push on the relevant LSK on the left hand side swaps the active and standby frequencies.

Partially entered frequencies are completed (if valid) and invalid frequencies are highlighted in amber and accompanied with information in the message area.

If a radio has its transmission key selected, the name is shown in green reverse video, e.g. VHF1

If a radio has its reception knob selected, a loudspeaker symbol is shown. The loudspeaker symbol is shown crossed out if a radio is selected for transmission, but not reception.

For HF radios, the modulation mode can be selected. The selected mode is shown in cyan reverse video, e.g. ON

If a SELCAL is received, the RESET message is shown in the message area, a buzzer sounds, and the associated transmission key flashes amber.

In CPDLC operations, the message area shows a LOAD message if the appropriate uplink is received from the active ATC centre.

TEL page

The TEL page shows the call status, the call priority level and telephone number (or directory name) on all available SATCOM channels. The squawk code and TCAS shortcuts remain displayed.

New telephone numbers are entered by selecting the relevant LSK on the right hand side (cyan box appears) and using the numeric keypad, the up/down keys or the DIRECTORY sub-menu.

If a call is received, the RESET message is shown in the message area, a buzzer sounds, and the associated transmission key flashes amber. The details of the incoming call are shown on the TEL page.

ATC page

The ATC page shows the status and all operating modes of the transponder and TCAS. The active system or operating modes are shown in cyan reverse video eg: XPDR1.

Standby operating modes (for example, TCAS DISPLAY MODEs with TCAS on STBY) are shown in a cyan box.

Each press of the relevant LSK cycles between all the available systems or operating modes.

The IDENT command allows crews to respond to the ATC request.

The squawk code can be modified via the ATC page, or directly from any VHF, HF or TEL pages, by using the left hand LSK to select the code (cyan box appears) and then using the numeric keypad. After a few seconds the squawk code is shown in green to confirm its selection.

NAV page

The upper part of the NAV page is used to activate the STBY NAV function in case of FMS failure. After selecting STBY NAV, the access to all available RAD NAV means according to aircraft configuration is given via the LSK on the left hand side of the screen (for example, LS or VOR). Selecting those LSK gives access to sub-menus which can be used to enter frequency/channel and course information. If the STBY NAV function is activated, an indication STBY NAV is shown in reverse video on VHF, HF and TEL pages.

The lower part of the NAV page is used for listening to the different NAVAIDS (AUDIO NAV). Only the installed NAVAIDS are shown on the screen. The right hand LSK cycles through all the available means. Once selected, the NAVAID signal can be heard using the NAV reception knob. For installed NAVAIDS which make use of the BFO signal, the VOICE ON/OFF command is displayed and can be selected using the relevant LSK.

MENU page

The MENU page can show different prompts for the LSK according to the aircraft configuration. One example of information shown on this page includes the SELCAL code and access to the SATCOM SETTINGS sub-menu.

Certifying authority feedback

During the certification flight test campaign, the authorities declared:

“The new digital audio system performed as per design. All the communications were always clear from all the installed equipment, no interference was experienced during the flight, all the information provided in the RMP was well visible and the pilot did not notice any objectionable reflections. The new logic of operation is easy and intuitive. Even during high workload situations an airline pilot would easily operate with the new RMP and find all the communications clear and intelligible.”

Conclusion

The digital audio system, which will become the baseline on A320 and A330 Family aircraft over the next years, has been designed with installation, maintenance and operation improvements in mind. Experience in flight testing, both for development and certification, with Airbus, authority and airline flight crew members, showed that the digital audio system provides excellent audio quality, and the new RMP was considered very easy and intuitive to use, even by crew members with very limited exposure to the digital audio system.

Getting life-saving satellite imagery to where it's needed most - Airbus,"Thu, 05 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIwLTExLWdldHRpbmctbGlmZS1zYXZpbmctc2F0ZWxsaXRlLWltYWdlcnktdG8td2hlcmUtaXRzLW5lZWRlZC1tb3N00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The ‘International Charter Space and Major Disasters’ is a unique and worldwide collaboration, through which satellite data are made available to support crisis management. By combining Earth observation assets from different space agencies, the Charter enables resources and expertise to be coordinated for rapid response to major disaster situations; thereby helping civil protection authorities and the international humanitarian community.

Following the UNISPACE III conference held in Vienna, Austria in July 1999, the European and French space agencies (ESA and CNES) initiated the International Charter ‘Space and Major Disasters’, with the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) signing the Charter on 20 October 2000 and was first activated 20 years ago this month. Their assets then were ERS, SPOT, Formosat and RADARSAT. Today, the Charter gathers 17 worldwide members – most of which are space agencies – and 61 contributing satellites.

Airbus and the Charter

From the very beginning, Airbus satellites have played an active role in the Charter as we took part in the first Charter activation, after a huge landslide occurred in Slovenia in November 2000.

On 27 November 2000, the Civil Protection of Slovenia requested images from the Charter to aid in monitoring and stabilising the landslide, as well as in assessing damage. To this end, we provided two SPOT 4 images: one archive image, taken on 19 August, and a second new image acquired on 29 November, following emergency tasking of the satellite.

Having an image acquired rapidly at that time was really challenging as there were fewer Earth observation satellites in orbit, meaning that it could take several days before image acquisition. Moreover, the resolution was very different to that of today, making damage mapping much more difficult, as you can understand with the below image comparison showing the 20-year-old image on the left and a much more recent image on the right showing the landslide site, still visible today, in much clearer detail.

In 2005, the UK Space Agency joined the Charter adding resources from the Airbus-operated DMC Constellation. Then in 2010, the German Space Agency (DLR) also became a member of the Charter, providing support through the TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X satellites, built and operated by Airbus.

What matters most in imagery used to support disaster relief is fast response, but also quality e.g. in cloudy regions a clear view cannot be guaranteed. This is why having a large range of satellites covering the affected area – whether from the Airbus Earth observation constellation or other Charter partners – together with latest-generation sensors, like the upcoming Airbus Pléiades Neo and CO3D satellites, are what makes the Charter so invaluable.

The latest Charter activation supported by our satellites occurred in mid-October, where tropical storms in Vietnam brought heavy rainfall and high wind speeds causing severe flooding across the country’s central provinces, causing loss of life and displaced persons. The main sources of imagery came from TanDEM-X and Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites.

A team focused on rapid response

The arrival of the Charter reshaped the ways of working for the Airbus team in charge of satellite tasking. They moved from normal working-hours to a real 24/7 set-up to make sure they were ready and available to support requests from the Charter.

How do Airbus’ teams manage Charter activation requests?

When the 24/7 team receives a request, they rapidly analyse the upcoming satellite passes to propose a tasking plan. This means selecting the right satellites and conducting an acquisition feasibility study (taking into account elements like location and weather). The selected satellite is then tasked, for the next 10 days, and the activation stops as soon as the expected image is acquired: cloud-free, full coverage of the target area). Once the satellite images are acquired, they are sent to the requesting authority and enter the processing chain to map the affected areas.

Irrespective of the origin of the request, the process remains the same, with a dedicated, highly professional and responsive team, where everything possible is done to shorten the time between Charter activation and map delivery to the rescue teams on the ground.

Airbus: helicopter industry sales down by 40-50% - Vertical Mag - Vertical Magazine,"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXItaW5kdXN0cnktc2FsZXMtZG93bi1ieS00MC01MC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The global helicopter industry has seen a downturn in new aircraft sales of 40 to 50 percent in 2020, according to new figures from Airbus Helicopters, thanks to the continuing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Despite the downturn, bookings have continued coming in for the Airbus H160, which is set to be certified by the FAA in early 2021. Airbus Photo

Airbus’s sales figures run closer to a 25- to 30-percent drop in terms of units, Airbus Helicopters CEO Bruno Even told journalists during a media conference call, allowing the manufacturer to gain an increased share of the shrinking civil market.

“The competition is more impacted [by the Covid crisis] than us,” he said.

Even pointed to the continued success of the light twin H145 — boosted by the certification this year of a five-bladed variant that provides operators with an increase of 330 pounds (150 kilograms) in useful load over the previous version of the type — and “good momentum” in sales of its new medium H160.

The OEM is continuing to meet its target of 15 to 20 bookings a year for the H160, said Even, allowing it to develop an order backlog of 40 to 50 aircraft. Along with anticipated government and military demand, Airbus is aiming to ramp up to 40 orders a year over the next three years.

At the other end of the scale, light helicopter sales are suffering. “When it comes to the light helicopters, the Ecureil [known as the AStar in North America] — we had already observed this in 2008/2009, the previous [economic] crisis — VIP, tourism, utilities are directly impacted by this crisis, so we see a reduction in volume.”

As Even noted, the global helicopter market reduction isn’t a new phenomenon — 2019’s figures also represented a drop from the previous year’s returns, as the oil-and-gas slump continued to make its mark across the industry.

“The helicopter market is already facing — for four/five years — a continued decrease [in sales], so from that perspective, the [Covid] crisis just reinforced this trend,” he said. He added that Airbus had already put in place a “strong transformation plan” to adapt to this longer-term downturn — including things such as worksite specialization — which is providing major benefits to the OEM during the short-term Covid crisis.

In terms of the reduction in bookings, Even said Airbus isn’t seeing cancelled orders — just deferred decisions from customers. “They’re shifting the potential decision to buy a new helicopter,” he said. “It means that helicopters are flying, helicopters are delivering missions that are still required and needed — and sometimes more than ever, when it comes to medical service in this Covid period.”

Airbus’s figures in terms of flight activity make for better reading than the bookings, with an average reduction in flight hours of about 15 percent over 2019.

“[The reduction of flight hours] is significant, but clearly not at the level of the 50 percent or the 80 percent [reduction] that we see for commercial aviation in some parts of the world,” said Even. He acknowledged that some sectors are seeing a much steeper drop in flight hours than others — tourism and VIP flights, in particular.

Innovation roadmap

Airbus’s support and services have seen “good momentum” despite the downturn, said Even. Indeed, in its parent company’s third quarter report, it was the helicopter group’s higher revenues from services that had allowed it to report “broadly stable” overall revenue for the first nine months of the year.

Even said Airbus has clearly benefitted from its global footprint — including 25 customers centers around the world — which allows it to be in close proximity to its customers, wherever they are. At a time of complex travel restrictions, this is a major bonus.

He also noted the company’s strategy over recent years to encourage its customers to make use of various maintenance contracts — such as HCARE — “and these clearly help us in this market context.”

In terms of the impact of the crisis at Airbus’s facilities, work has slowed at its sites on Donauworth and Marignane to allow the company to implement new safety measures for its employees.

Despite the challenges of 2020, Airbus has still recorded two noteworthy certifications — of the new medium H160, and the five-bladed version of the H145. Both have been approved by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification pending.

Even said Airbus expects the FAA to approve the H160 “early in 2021,” which will allow the type to be delivered to its launch customer, which is in the U.S. Given the challenges of working during the pandemic, Even said a first-quarter 2021 approval will represent “a great achievement” for the program.

The five-bladed H145 is set to be approved by the FAA “in the coming weeks,” he added.

Other developments in the pipeline include EASA certification of the H135 with a new alternate gross weight (an increased takeoff weight and useful load of 265 pounds/120 kilograms), expected “in the coming weeks;” and a power increase on the H125’s Safran Arriel 2D engine that will give an additional 308 pounds (140 kilograms) of external load capability. Airbus expects this to be certified by the end of 2020.

The OEM’s longer-term innovation strategy includes its ongoing work around the unmanned VSR700, derived from the Hélicoptères Guimbal Cabri G2, and the urban air mobility prototype CityAirbus.

Even said the latter electrically-powered multirotor demonstrator, which first flew at the end of 2019, was “a good example” of what the company is targeting in the medium- to long-term.

“It’s about a business opportunity, but it’s also about bringing new capability when it comes to our military customers and civil customer, and it’s about Airbus Helicopters being committed to sustainable aviation.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.997736930847168}",positive,0.997736930847168,1
Airbus wins ESA's LSTM temperature-check mission for Copernicus next generation - Airbus,"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMC0xMS1haXJidXMtd2lucy1lc2FzLWxzdG0tdGVtcGVyYXR1cmUtY2hlY2stbWlzc2lvbi1mb3ItY29wZXJuaWN1cy1uZXh00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Contract valued at € 380 million

Airbus Spain to lead industrial consortium: first Copernicus prime for Spain

Madrid, 13 November 2020 – The European Space Agency (ESA) has selected Airbus Defence and Space as prime contractor for the new Land Surface Temperature Monitoring (LSTM) mission. LSTM is part of Copernicus, the European Union's Earth observation programme for global monitoring. It is one of the six new missions, expanding the capabilities of the current Copernicus space component. The contract is valued at € 380 million which includes the development and building of two LSTM satellites.

The main objective of LSTM is to deliver global high spatio-temporal day- and night-time land surface temperature measurements. Satellite data analysis for mapping, monitoring and forecasting the Earth's natural resources helps to understand what, when and where changes are taking place. In particular, this mission will respond to the needs of European farmers to make agricultural production on individual farms more sustainable, as water shortages increase and changes in the environment take place. Specialists will be able to calculate in real time how much water different plants require in different areas, and how often those plants need to be irrigated.

Land-surface temperature measurements and derived evapotranspiration - the water vapour emitted by plants as they grow - are key parameters to understand and respond to climate variations, manage water resources for agriculture, and predict droughts. Thermal infrared observations will support a range of additional services to address land degradation, soil composition, natural hazards such as fires and volcano activity, coastal and inland water management as well as urban heat island issues.

Jean-Marc Nasr, Head of Space Systems at Airbus said: “Measuring surface temperatures will help make agricultural production more efficient across the planet, benefitting us all. With Airbus on board all Copernicus Sentinel satellites to date, we are delighted that ESA is further entrusting us with this next generation mission for the world’s most ambitious Earth observation programme. This contract again confirms Airbus’ position at the forefront of space technologies for Earth observation and as the world’s n°1 exporter.”

LSTM will operate from a low-Earth, polar orbit, to map both land-surface temperature and rates of evapotranspiration with unprecedented field-scale detail. It will be able to identify the temperatures of individual fields and image the Earth every three days at 50 m resolution. This is about 400 times more detail than is currently acquired from space. Its observations will cover a wide temperature range, from approx. -20°C to +30°C, with very high precision (0.3°C).

LSTM is the first Copernicus mission awarded to a Spanish company and the third ESA mission to be primed by Airbus in Madrid after the successful in orbit delivery of Cheops, the exoplanet hunter, and SEOSAT-Ingenio which is ready for launch. Being selected to lead this mission is a major milestone for space in Spain and again demonstrates ESA’s confidence in Airbus as a strong partner to prime ESA missions. The industrial consortium comprises more than 45 companies and institutions from up to 18 different countries. The support of the Spanish delegation to ESA was key in reaching this achievement.

Airbus has complete responsibility for the entire LSTM. It will design and build the LSTM satellite in Madrid, while the development and production of the advanced technology instrument will be carried out by Airbus in Toulouse.

The optical instrument flown on the LSTM satellite leverages Airbus’ latest innovations from programmes such as the Franco-Indian TRISHNA mission to offer a best-in-class instrument. It will acquire images in Very Near Infrared, Short Wave Infrared and Thermal Infrared. With a four day revisit capability, the satellite will fly over European latitudes when the sun, and consequently stress on crops, are at their highest, to facilitate evapotranspiration measurement.

Overall, Airbus is responsible for the spacecraft or payload on 3 of the 6 new generation Copernicus Environment and Earth observation missions: LSTM, CRISTAL and Rose-L, and is providing critical equipment to all six.

From Earth orbit to the Moon…and beyond! - Airbus,"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIwLTExLWZyb20tZWFydGgtb3JiaXQtdG8tdGhlLW1vb25hbmQtYmV5b25k0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As the International Space Station (ISS) marks two decades of continuous human presence, circling the Earth more than 120,000 times with key participation from Airbus, planning is now underway for an exciting next step: setting humanity on a sustainable course to the Moon, with the company having an important role in this new adventure.

Airbus’ long list of ISS contributions covers activities from development of software and experiments, mission preparations and system integration to flight operations, cargo resupply, hosting of payloads aboard the facility, and the provision of such infrastructure elements as the rack-mounted regenerative life support system.

Astronaut Alexander Gerst is shown with the International Space Station’s Life Support Rack, which was built by Airbus and has been aboard the orbital facility since October 2018.

Cooperation that spans the globe

With the ISS’ international scope, Airbus has worked with the primary partners, spanning Europe, the U.S., Russia, Japan and Canada – cooperating with national space agencies and industry, thereby providing a framework for the company’s involvement in future space exploration.

With our achievements on the ISS, Airbus has earned its role in taking humankind back to the Moon and deeper into space.

- Gerd Hajen, Systems and Operations Engineer in Airbus’ Low-Earth Orbit and Suborbital Missions Department

Airbus’ ISS involvement traces its roots to the space station’s early days, as the company produced Data Management System computers for Russia’s Zvezda Service Module. Zvezda was launched during the summer of 2000 as the station’s third module, and its Airbus-built fault-tolerant computers collect data and provide navigation, handle command/control, along with facilitating communications and operations for the station’s Russian segment.

Experiments in Earth orbit

Two years later, the space station received a logistics module containing Airbus’ Microgravity Science Glovebox, which provides an enclosed, safe environment for experiments using liquids, naked flame and particles – all while closely simulating laboratory conditions typically found on Earth. The glovebox has operated for thousands of hours aboard the ISS, used in such investigations as material science, thermal management, protein crystal growth, life sciences, fire detection, combustion and technology demonstrations.

Beginning in 2006, the Airbus-supplied Minus Eighty-Degree Laboratory Freezers for ISS (MELFI) were added to the station, enabling refrigerated storage and freezing of biological and life science samples.

More recently, the Airbus-developed Bartolomeo platform has been attached to the ISS’ exterior for hosting payloads. Airbus offers an end-to-end service with technical support for payload preparations, launch and installation, operations and data transfer, as well as an optional return to Earth. Scheduled to enter service early next year, the Bartolomeo platform offers the only unobstructed ISS view towards Earth and into outer space, with applications for its hosted payloads including (but not limited to) Earth observation, robotics, material science and astrophysics.

The Airbus-supplied Bartolomeo platform is depicted on the International Space Station’s exterior in this composite image.

Airbus’ ISS prime contractor roles

During the past 20-plus years, Airbus has stepped up as the prime contractor for two key ISS elements: the Columbus pressurised module that has served as a permanently-attached multifunctional laboratory since February 2008; and the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) cargo spacecraft for ISS resupply missions, which performed five heavy-lift flights between 2008 and 2015.

The Columbus module is Europe’s largest single contribution to the ISS, and Airbus’ responsibilities have covered the module’s engineering, development of experiments, integration and testing, launch preparations and processing. In addition, Airbus helped set up the Columbus control centre and ground segment in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany, and provided support for flight control and operations at this German ground facility.

German Astronaut Thomas Reiter works with one of the MELFI (the Minus Eighty-Degree Laboratory Freezers for ISS) from Airbus, which came aboard the ISS beginning in 2006.

'Keeping the lights on' with ATV

In welcoming 240-plus crewmembers aboard the ISS since it was first occupied on 2 November 2000, the space station has required regular replenishment of supplies. The Airbus-developed Automated Transfer Vehicle helped keep the ISS alive and active by delivering more than 31.5 tonnes of supplies (including propellant, water, air, food, and scientific research equipment), while also using its own propulsion system to raise the station’s orbit numerous times and help manoeuvre it clear of space debris.

The ATV's capabilities – particularly its automatic docking with the ISS and providing life-supporting services – underscored Airbus’ mastering of vital technologies that can be applied in future space exploration missions. This, together with all Airbus’ expertise demonstrated throughout the space station’s orbital career, contributed to the company’s selection as a full partner in Orion – the next U.S.-led spacecraft to send humans into space – ESA’s contribution to NASA’s Artemis programme.

Over the Moon with Orion

Airbus is responsible for Orion’s European Service Module, which will provide propulsion, power, water, oxygen and nitrogen, as well as keeping the spacecraft at the right temperature and on the correct flightpath. Three European Service Modules are contracted to be developed and delivered by Airbus for use with Orion as it takes crews to the future Gateway lunar orbiting station for exploration of the Moon – with the possibility for travel further out in space…even reaching an asteroid and perhaps Mars.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999865293502808}",neutral,0.9999865293502808,0

Should Boeing Suppliers Shift Toward Airbus? - Aviation Week,"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9hZXJvc3BhY2UvbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy1zdXBwbHktY2hhaW4vc2hvdWxkLWJvZWluZy1zdXBwbGllcnMtc2hpZnQtdG93YXJkLWFpcmJ1c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It was a foregone conclusion by the time Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun acknowledged in October that the Chicago-based OEM had lost commercial aircraft market share to its European rival.

Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, the grounding and production halt of the Boeing 737 MAX had spurred industry advisors to warn of a potential 60-40 split, or greater, between Airbus and Boeing in narrowbodies.

That is a monstrous shift from the traditional 50-50 split, but it comes from monumental changes. “Boeing’s struggles with the 737 MAX [have created] a once-in-a-generation opportunity for Airbus to gain significant market share in the narrowbody aircraft market,” Morgan Stanley analysts Kristine Liwag and Matthew Sharpe wrote Nov. 9. “Due to the long cycle and limited number of programs and players in aerospace . . . a strategic market-share move could have multi-decade implications.”

For aerospace suppliers struggling with the worst downturn in history, the market-share shift begs the question: Should suppliers shift to Airbus, too?

The temptation is there. “The last 18 months has seen Airbus gain a complete lead, and probably unassailable lead, over Boeing,” analyst Sash Tusa of Agency Partners told an Aviation Week webinar in November. “We are seeing Airbus-related suppliers looking more valuable than Boeing suppliers with same earnings, same revenue. Airbus has the backlog, Boeing does not—on narrowbody, Airbus has 60% of backlog. That shows how brutal the K-shaped impact on valuations can be.”

The reasons to consider a shift vary by supplier but start with the same consideration. If Airbus forces its customers to follow through and take delivery of A320-family aircraft, then those customers may defer or cancel any MAX orders they have, especially with the walk-away opportunity presented by the MAX’s grounding.

Morgan Stanley data shows that Boeing has 2,717 MAX-family orders through 2025, and 29% (791 aircraft) are from lessors or airlines that also have A320 orders. Indeed, so-called mixed airlines account for the largest part of the orderbook in 2023-25.

Before COVID-19 and the MAX grounding, the supply chain was the bottleneck and was hard-pressed to produce more than 120 narrowbodies a month.

In turn, experts suggest whichever OEM can push its supplier base to sustain a production rate of 60 aircraft a month or more first could “win” the race until future narrowbodies enter production. Airbus already is goading its suppliers to be ready for rate 47 by October 2021, while Boeing sees only rate 31 by “early” 2022—and even so, supplier confidence on hitting that mark is noticeably lagging (several analysts expect both OEMs will have to cut rates further).

At least one leading Boeing-oriented Tier 1 supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, is shifting to Airbus—although that has more to do with strategic planning that predated the MAX’s problems and COVID-19. The 737 family was responsible for 50% of Spirit’s annual revenue through 2019, and altogether Boeing was nearly 80%.

It made sense for Spirit to diversify toward Airbus, but what about other suppliers? The general answer so far—at least according to many analysts and consultants—is that they probably should not.

“I really don’t think so,” analyst Doug Harned of Bernstein told an Aviation Week webinar. To begin with, 40% of market share is a huge base. Further, “the share dynamic may be closer than people think it is,” he added.

Consultant Scott Thompson of PwC agreed in a separate interview. “We’re dealing with a duopoly, and market forces will drive it back to a 50-50 split,” he predicts. But, of course, how the balance is achieved could matter, he concludes.

Harned agrees some lower-tier suppliers could be affected if they are over-dependent on Boeing, or if Boeing’s tactics to regain market share put more pressure on suppliers. But he does not expect that. “Some smaller suppliers may have issues, but the pain will not get any worse and [the] trajectory will get better,” Harned said.

There are other factors that could make such shifts pointless. “Although it remains to be seen to what degree a market-share battle could play out between Boeing and Airbus, this dynamic bears watching, as there are no winners in a market-share battle,” Liwag and Sharpe said.

Aerospace manufacturing is often lamented as a slow-adapting, slow-moving industry. But in this case, many observers think it is best not to change and to let the current market-share disruption pass without re-architecting the supplier bases.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8295387625694275}",neutral,0.8295387625694275,0

That is meant to define a state that is sustainable even as circumstances change dramatically. But as the pandemic continues and recovery in key markets is slowing or even reversing with new outbreaks, doubts remain that industry players have adjusted enough to reflect actual demand.

Airbus and Boeing plan for around 1,100 deliveries in 2021

A320neo rate increase and further widebody cuts are possible

Under current plans, Airbus and Boeing would deliver around 1,100 aircraft in 2021, with most of the uncertainty centering on how many of the stored Boeing 737 MAXs will be delivered, how quickly MAX production is ramped up and whether Airbus moves ahead with a rate increase on the A320neo family at some point in the second half of 2021.

The two OEMs’ combined output is well below the 1,583 aircraft handed over to customers in 2018. But it is roughly in line with the 1,150 reached in 2019, the year that saw the major impact of the MAX grounding (starting in March) but not yet that of COVID-19. This year, through the end of September, Airbus and Boeing delivered a combined 439 aircraft, implying that civil aircraft production is heading for a relatively steep rise very soon. In addition, 387 delivered MAXs will be added to the already available capacity if and when the global grounding of the type is lifted in the coming weeks.

“Our analysis continues to demonstrate the lack of recovery in global airline traffic sufficient to support demand for current production rates,” Agency Partners analyst Sash Tusa wrote in a research note to clients. “The primary uncertainty is the ability of Airbus to deliver commercial aircraft to its customers, with the A230neo family the standout challenge,” Bernstein Research analyst Douglas Harned commented in an Airbus-focused release.

Nonetheless, Boeing is keeping to its earlier announced plans to slash widebody production rates by 50% by 2021, while simultaneously hoping to gradually restore 737 production to 31 per month by the start of 2022.

The exact size and timing of the 737 rate increase will be dictated by the pace of the overall traffic recovery and also by Boeing’s ability to remarket and reconfigure a large portion of the approximately 450 undelivered aircraft in storage, according to company executives. “We now expect delivery of about half of the aircraft currently in storage by the end of the year [2021] and the majority of the remaining in the following year,” says Boeing Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Greg Smith. An Aviation Week analysis finds that about 60 of the stored aircraft are without a customer due to cancellations and orderbook reshuffling during the model’s 19-month grounding. Smith warns that the timing of the 737 production rate ramp-up profile “continues to be dynamic.”

Boeing’s current scenario has global traffic recovering to 2019 levels in about three years. Although the U.S. domestic passenger market is showing signs of a steady recovery, the slower pace of growth in the international air travel sector is weighing heavily on the company’s widebody plans—particularly those for the 787. With production of the 787 due to be consolidated from mid-2021 onward solely in South Carolina—at a reduced rate of only six per month, compared to the current combined output of 10 per month with Everett, Washington—the OEM warns that further downward trimming may be considered.

Boeing says it has a “large number”—believed to be around 50—of undelivered 787s in the inventory, and together with the slower than expected recovery in international traffic, Smith says the company will “continue to assess the downside risk of our production rates going forward.”

The combined 777/777X rate, which is also slowing from the current five per month to just two per month in 2021, looks likely to remain at this level for some time. Boeing also hints that the target date for entry into service of the 777-9, the first variant of the 777X family, could also slide into 2022. Although the company already announced this year that initial deliveries would not be in 2021 as originally expected, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun suggests that could be delayed even more.

“As with any development program, there are inherent risks that can affect schedule,” he says. “While we continue to drive toward entry into service in 2022, this timing will ultimately be influenced by certification requirements defined by the regulators.”

Though production rates are not yet being revised, Boeing is cutting more jobs, primarily in its commercial businesses. An initial target of 16,000 reductions announced this year has grown to 30,000 by 2022, with a combination of voluntary and involuntary programs. Boeing plans to have 130,000 employees by the end of 2021. The company posted a net loss of $466 million, or $0.79 per share, in the third quarter as revenues fell 29% to $14.1 billion, led by a 56% drop in Boeing Commercial Airplanes business unit revenues.

In spite of anticipated overcapacity, Airbus continues to consider raising single-aisle production rates from 40 aircraft per month to 47 at some point in 2021, a move that would be “backed by the backlog,” according to CEO Guillaume Faury.

The manufacturer’s current production and supply plan foresees it possibly raising output by the end of the second quarter of 2021, though that is by no means certain. An earlier version of the plan anticipated such a rise by the beginning of the second quarter. Airbus pushed that over three months due to market conditions. “We are in a lower-for-longer scenario,” Faury says. Nonetheless, he stresses, “It is important that the supply chain is prepared, and we expect suppliers to be committed and ready.”

Extended market weakness could lead Airbus to delay a decision to increase output even further into the second half of 2021. And one important supplier, MTU Aero Engines, is voicing caution. “There is a certain skepticism [among suppliers] that this will really happen,” CEO Reiner Winkler says. “We are assuming rate 40 but can be flexible and react quickly. I would wait a little more before we make financial commitments.”

Thales, another important Airbus supplier, is expecting production levels will be below those publicly announced by the OEM for its own restructuring plan, yet Faury points out that “rate 40 is solid.”

Agency Partners’ Tusa also is not so sure the rate increase is coming. He believes keeping those plans alive is one way to prevent customers from deferring deliveries at no cost if they can demonstrate that Airbus production is below a level necessary to comply with contractual obligations. And it may also keep airlines away from the temptation to order cheap 737 MAXs.

“Airbus might need a narrowbody rate increase to offset—both in volume terms for its suppliers and financially for investors—the potential impact of further cuts to the A350 and A330 widebody programs,” Tusa also contends. He thinks A330 demand will be “especially weak” in 2021-22 and that A350 production at five aircraft per month looks “similarly unsupported.”

Faury points out that the A330 remains “an important piece of the puzzle.” Airbus has reduced the production rate of its smallest and oldest active widebody program to two aircraft per month, which Faury says is still “sustainable.” “[The A330 has the potential] to be a very good aircraft to move out of the pandemic,” he says. “Airlines will be looking for very cost-efficient solutions.”

The A330’s very low level of production has raised questions about its future: Will it be dumped as Airbus aims to stem overall losses? That such a move would create a Boeing 787 monopoly is a key reason it is unlikely to happen. Airbus had been pricing the A330neo aggressively in pre-COVID-19 campaigns, but its backlog—marked by large and highly questionable orders from AirAsia X and Iran Air—remains weak. Faury also forecasts that airlines will need to replace the in-service A330 fleet in due course. Unlike the case for narrowbodies, Airbus does not anticipate increased output for the A350 “in the foreseeable future.”

In the first nine months of 2020, Airbus delivered 341 aircraft, 230 fewer than a year ago. The deliveries include: 18 A220s, 282 A320-family aircraft, nine A330s and 32 A350s. The OEM has delivered 155 fewer narrowbodies and 75 fewer widebodies than in 2019.

Single-aisle production was cut this year from more than 60 aircraft to 40. A350 rates were reduced from 10 aircraft per month to six and later to five. A330 production was halved.

Airbus delivered a total of 135 aircraft in the third quarter. “Production and deliveries now converge,” says Faury. Airbus still has an inventory of 135 aircraft that have been built but not delivered. But according to CFO Dominik Asam, only 10 or so of the 135 aircraft are actual white tails with no customers; the vast majority are aircraft for which deliveries have been deferred by 1-2 years.

While Airbus recorded a negative free cash flow before mergers and acquisitions and customer financing of €11.8 billion ($13.8 billion) for the first nine months of the year, more than twice the amount of 2019, cash flow turned to a positive €600 million in the third quarter as the number of aircraft deliveries grew and benefits from cost cuts became visible.

In the commercial aircraft business, Airbus suffered a 33% decline in revenues to €7.7 billion in the third quarter, compared to a 43% drop in the first nine months, indicating that its financial performance is slowly improving. The unit posted a €591 million operating loss, compared to a €1.12 billion profit a year earlier. Restructuring charges of €1.2 billion weighed heavily on group results, €981 million of which are recognized in the commercial aircraft division as the company moves ahead with job cuts and other cost-cutting measures.

More than 30% of the global passenger jet fleet, or about 8,100 aircraft, remains in storage, according to airline analytics and consulting firm Cirium.

Last month, Airbus and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency issued an advisory that battery systems on A320, A330, A340 and A380 aircraft may not fully recharge after inactivity and lead to a power loss during operation.

During maintenance checks for parked aircraft the batteries are physically disconnected and reconnected. Nickel-cadmium (Ni-Cd) batteries disconnected from the electrical system self-discharge due to an electrochemical phenomenon, inducing a reduction of battery capacity. When the battery is charged again from the aircraft, the battery does not recover 100% of its initial capacity and battery capacity progressively decreases after each reconnection, according to an EASA safety information bulletin.

"HOTR: Airbus, Boeing R&D spending continues decline - Leeham News and Analysis","Thu, 05 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMC8xMS8wNS9ob3RyLWFpcmJ1cy1ib2VpbmctcmQtc3BlbmRpbmctY29udGludWVzLWRlY2xpbmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By the Leeham News Team

Nov. 5, 2020, © Leeham News: Research and Development spending by the Airbus and Boeing commercial units declined year-over-year.

The movement is in keeping with cost-cutting by the Big Two OEMs. For Airbus, the reduction is due to the coronavirus pandemic. For Boeing, it’s due to the 737 MAX grounding and the pandemic.

Boeing’s spending typically lags Airbus. Richard Aboulafia, a consultant with Teal Group, for years criticized Boeing over its smaller spending, favoring instead shareholder value. Airbus overtook Boeing is innovative single-aisle airplane development years ago. Boeing’s choice of creating a 777 derivative instead of a new design to compete with the A350-1000 proved to be a weak move. There are only a handful of customers and the skyline is weak.

COVID-related airline bankruptcies, etc.

Sundair of Germany is the latest airline to enter a restructuring under a “protective shield” during the COVID-19 crisis.

Spirit, supplier to Airbus and Boeing, shows production rates

Spirit AeroSystems, a supplier to Airbus and Boeing, listed productions rates in its 3Q2020 financial information.

As of October 1, 2020 the overall rates announced by Boeing and used by the Company in the third quarter of 2020 are as follows:

•B737 MAX, including P-8, of 72 shipsets for 2020, increasing to 31 airplanes per month (“APM”) in 2022;

•B787 average production volume of 10 APM in 2020, decreasing to 6 APM in 2021 and 2022;

•B777/777X average production volume of 3.6 APM in 2020, decreasing to 1.8 APM in 2021;

•B767 current and future production volume of 3 APM; and

•B747 current production volume of 0.5 APM and ending production in 2022.

The Company is attempting to calibrate its cost structure to the lower production volumes and manage the impact of excess production capacity across our sites. The Company’s strategy to recalibrate its cost structure is likely to lead to a consolidation of sites where excess capacity exists.

Airbus Production Volumes

As of October 1, 2020 the overall rates announced by Airbus and used by the Company in third quarter are as follows:

•Single-aisle average production volume of 40 APM;

•A350 average production volume of 3.5 APM in 2020, increasing to 5 APM end of 2021; and

•A330 average production volume of 2 APM.

VSR700 achieves autonomous takeoff and landing from moving platform - Airbus,"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIwLTExLXZzcjcwMC1hY2hpZXZlcy1hdXRvbm9tb3VzLXRha2VvZmYtYW5kLWxhbmRpbmctZnJvbS1tb3ZpbmctcGxhdGZvcm3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The VSR700 optionally piloted vehicle (OPV) has successfully achieved fully autonomous takeoff and landing (ATOL) approaches, validating its autonomy to and from a moving platform and advancing the VSR700 programme towards its end goal: offering a tactical unmanned aerial system (UAS) with ATOL capacities for global navies. The landing zone: a pitching, yawing platform, mounted on a trailer to simulate the conditions of a moving ship deck.

A crucial milestone

The VSR700 programme began in 2018 when Airbus Helicopters and Naval Group won a contract with the French DGA (Direction Générale de l’Armement) to develop a future tactical drone for the French Navy. Since then, the programme has achieved many milestones in the de-risking phase, including this crucial step of demonstrating the technology needed to perform an ATOL from a battleship.

“A primary challenge for any naval drone is to approach ships in heavy seas as its landing pad moves toward or away from it, on rolling swells that reduce or lengthen the relative distance,” says Nicolas Delmas, head of the VSR700 programme. “Flying in such conditions, the difference of a few centimeters can determine the fate of an entire mission.”

The moving deck trials pave the way for the next major milestone - the forthcoming sea trials with the prototype, known as the SDAM (Système de Drone Aérien pour la Marine). These trials will put the vehicle’s navigation, positioning, flight control and auto-pilot systems to the ultimate test.

A primary challenge for any naval drone is to approach ships in heavy seas as its landing pad moves toward or away from it, ... Flying in such conditions, the difference of a few centimeters can determine the fate of an entire mission.

- Nicolas Delmas, Head of the VSR700 programme

A step-by-step testing approach

“Our programme has a step-by-step approach with quick development loops. This involves rapidly testing new functions with the OPV to get early feedback with a safety pilot onboard for emergencies, before putting these systems on the VSR700 prototype,” says Delmas. “Whereas the VSR700 prototype focuses on the development of vehicle performances, the OPV is primarily used to develop and validate the piloting laws and dedicated ATOL functions.”

In this context, it was on the OPV that Airbus teams developed and matured the automatic flight control system (AFCS) laws which eventually enabled the prototype to achieve an ATOL from a fixed surface earlier this year.

The approach has seen positive progress: In 2018, the OPV’s first autonomous flight without a safety pilot; in 2019, the prototype’s first autonomous tethered flight; and in 2020, the first untethered flight.

And a second prototype is on the way. Earlier this year, a second SDAM was ordered for the French Navy in the frame of the French stimulus plan, enabling the programme to further secure next steps, such as the development of technologies and refinement of specifications.

“Finding” the deck

Collaboration with Airbus Defence and Space was essential for the moving deck trials. Motion was integrated thanks to a vehicle provided by Airbus Defence and Space known as the “DeckMotion Simulator” - a moving pad mounted on a trailer.

Ensuring the autopilot could locate and “talk” to the DeckMotion Simulator was DeckFinder, a local positioning system developed by Airbus Defence and Space that lets manned and remotely piloted aerial vehicles, including helicopters, determine their relative position in harsh environmental conditions.

“DeckFinder transmits the platform’s position in real time to the OPV’s automatic pilot with a very high level of accuracy, which cannot be achieved with classical positioning equipment like a GPS. This accuracy is crucial to achieve the final phase of the approach and the landing on a moving reference like a ship deck to enable the landing,” says Delmas.

After putting the demonstrator through a number of scenarios, including replicating sea state conditions, the test campaign will continue in order to fully validate DeckFinder’s interface with the autopilot and various systems and to get the best from its combination with the AFCS of the VSR700.

The VSR700 has the greatest endurance of any vertical takeoff/landing unmanned aerial vehicle (VUAV) in the 500 to 1,000 kg class today and will be able to carry a full load of high capability sensors, while its compact size means it can be stationed on board frigates and destroyers alongside manned helicopters. It will complement maritime security missions, search and rescue, and anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare, as well as ISTAR*.

Will Boeing Or Airbus Stock Grow More By 2025? - Yahoo Finance,"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9ib2VpbmctYWlyYnVzLXN0b2NrLWdyb3ctbW9yZS0xMzMwMzc3ODcuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Every week, Benzinga conducts a sentiment survey to find out what traders are most excited about, interested in or thinking about as they manage and build their personal portfolios.

For years, the two main players in the aerospace field have been U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing (NYSE: BA) and European aircraft manufacturer Airbus (Pink: EADSF).

We surveyed a group of over 400 investors on whether shares of Boeing or Airbus stock would grow the most by 2025. About 65% of investors said Boeing would experience the largest percentage gain in the next five years.

Boeing Vs. Airbus Stock

It's no secret speculation around the safety and future commercial viability of the Boeing 737 Max weighed heavily on investors' minds. We recently reported the Federal Aviation Administration on Nov. 18 said it's satisfied with the changes Boeing has made to the 737 Max after a series of collaborative and independent regulatory reviews.

Now that the aircraft has been cleared by the FAA to fly again, many participants in our study remarked how this news impacts their investment decisions.

“Now that the 737 Max decision is over with, there will be more scrutiny from the FAA over the next few years in regards to new Boeing projects, thus ensuring a superior and certifiable product line. I believe Boeing is by far a larger company with a superior product and industry reputation as far as Defense and Space is concerned,” they said.

Another respondent demonstrated confidence in Boeing noting how the “737 max problems in the rearview mirror and their backlog of plane orders will keep them very busy for a while. Before the pandemic Boeing was trading much higher than they are now. After the news from the FAA, Boeing will come back better than before,” the investor said.

Here’s how much investing ,000 in Boeing on the same day the Boeing 737 Max debuted would be worth today.

Meanwhile, 34.6% of respondents said the European aircraft manufacturer Airbus will grow the most in the next five years.

Story continues

Airbus has struggled in the midst of the pandemic. In an August report detailing year-to-date orders through July, orders at Airbus are down by half.

The airframer said it received 302 net orders after customers canceled orders for 67 aircraft. In 2019, the aircraft manufacturer had 768 net orders.

This survey was conducted by Benzinga in November 2020 and included the responses of a diverse population of adults 18 or older.

Opting into the survey was completely voluntary, with no incentives offered to potential respondents. The study reflects results from over 400 adults.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Airbus SE <AIR.PA> and Boeing Co <BA.N> are expected to turn to hybrid electric technology when they develop the next generation of airplanes because of limits on improving current engines, the head of a major aircraft lessor said on Thursday.

Airbus is already working hard on a hybrid solution but Boeing is likely to be more cautious about making a major investment in a new program given its challenges with the return of the 737 MAX and certification of the 777X, Air Lease Corp <AL.N> Chief Executive Steven Udvar-Hazy said at the Skift Aviation Forum.

""I have serious doubts that either Boeing or Airbus can design an all new airplane using current aerodynamic engine technologies that can have a meaningful - let's call it double-digit advantage over what we already have,"" he said in reference to fuel efficiency. ""So what I see evolving is more of a hybrid.""

Udvar-Hazy said hybrid engines would allow for a lighter aircraft weight, as well as a technology transition rather than a step change.

""Almost like we didn't go from all piston engine and diesel cars to all electric cars,"" he said. ""There's that transition with hybrids that have a smaller gasoline engine and then an electric augmentation engine, like the Prius for the example.""

Airbus said last year it was considering producing a hybrid plane by 2035 as it strives for a low-emission aircraft, while Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC <RR.L> said in March it expected hybrid planes carrying around 100 people to be flying commercially by 2029.

Boeing did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

Boeing's director of environmental strategy Sean Newsum said in January that scaling up hybrid technology to a 737-sized plane could take decades, though hybrid-powered regional planes could enter service in the 2030s, according to a FlightGlobal report.

Will Airbus-Boeing WTO Battle Continue Under New U.S. President? - Aviation Week,"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9hZXJvc3BhY2UvbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy1zdXBwbHktY2hhaW4vd2lsbC1haXJidXMtYm9laW5nLXd0by1iYXR0bGUtY29udGludWUtdW5kZXItbmV3LXVzLXByZXNpZGVudNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The World Trade Organization dispute between Airbus, Boeing, the EU and the U.S. over illegal state subsidies for large commercial aircraft has survived three U.S. presidents, two of whom enjoyed two terms in office. Will it survive a fourth?

With Democrat Joe Biden preparing to move into the White House in January, possibly bringing a more conducive and less antagonistic approach to global trade negotiations than his predecessor, expectations are high among aerospace experts that a deal might finally be achieved in the 16-year dispute. That may yet occur, but industry experts also caution against irrational exuberance.

Biden administration more likely to resolve the dispute

Protectionist tendencies mean no quick fix is probable

On Nov. 10, the EU placed $4 billion worth of penalty tariffs on imported U.S. goods due to illegal U.S. subsidies provided to Boeing, including 15% extra on new airliners bought by European owners, as well 25% against a raft of agricultural—and politically sensitive—goods. The moves, in effect, mirror the targeting of U.S. tariffs on EU goods last year, when the World Trade Organization (WTO) greenlighted $7.5 billion in penalties there.

The day before, EU Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis refuted the notion that the EU penalties were retaliation against the U.S. action, noting they are the natural conclusion of the EU’s WTO case against the U.S.—the same as the U.S. tariffs against Europe. He also noted that Europe’s tariffs are not linked to the U.S. elections, implying they would have come in the spring when the WTO originally had been slated to rule before officials were sent home due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Dombrovskis said he remains in “intensive” communication with the Trump administration and expects to continue working with it in coming months before Biden is sworn in. “We are open for a negotiated solution and open to drop our tariffs as soon as the U.S. is ready to drop theirs,” he said. The EU would continue that approach with a new administration, he noted.

That position was not a big surprise to some observers. “The idea is that the EU will want leverage, and the U.S. already has leverage,” notes Shanker Singham, chairman and CEO of Competere, a trade law and economic policy consultancy. “These are really decisions where the change in the presidency probably will make less of a difference than people think.

“These are very long-running issues; the Boeing-Airbus [dispute] has been running literally decades,” he continues. “Boeing is a very powerful force in the U.S. The Biden administration is not going to throw Boeing under the bus; they are going to continue to prosecute those interests. And on the EU side, they are going to continue to prosecute Airbus’ interests.”

With industry throttled back due to COVID-19, financial analysts have said the tariffs on both sides will have a minimal effect on OEM bottom lines or the nations’ workforces. Still, in February before the pandemic, Bloomberg Intelligence noted that even with tariffs on imported U.S. airplanes, Boeing would be less affected than Airbus.

“In a U.S.-Europe trade battle over airplanes, Airbus has more to lose,” Bloomberg Intelligence said. “All the fast-growing U.S. airlines purchase Airbus jets, including Frontier, Spirit, JetBlue, Allegiant and Delta.”

New data from the Aviation Week Network Fleet Discovery database shows 481 deliveries by Boeing to EU-based owners through 2029.

Bloomberg noted that it is also unclear whether the UK would place tariffs on U.S. aircraft as it leaves the EU and seeks to both bolster its economy and strike a trade deal with the U.S.

Singham agrees Brexit is a new complication. “There’s a wrinkle to this,” he says. “Where there is flexibility to do a deal on the underlying dispute—in other words, for the UK to give some compensation, whatever that happens to be—I think the UK will want to use it in order to get a deal with the U.S. and get its product off the retaliation list.”

Then again, other experts have asked whether a U.S.-U.K. trade deal could slow under a Biden administration. The reasons are numerous but include potential political differences between Biden and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, as well as the normal go-slow approach new U.S. administrations take to projects inherited from their predecessors. What is more, the EU has openly threatened to use another $4 billion worth of potential tariffs it won in a separate WTO trade case against the U.S.

The Trump administration reportedly has offered to end the dispute if Airbus pays roughly $10 billion as part of the resolution—a nonstarter for the European industrial giant and an idea swiftly rejected by Dombrovskis.

The likelihood is that the 16-year airliner subsidy dispute will stretch on into its 17th year.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999707043170929}",neutral,0.999707043170929,0
New Sensors Detect Disruptions in Assembly Operations at Airbus - Assembly Magazine,"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzc2VtYmx5bWFnLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy85NTk3MC1uZXctc2Vuc29ycy1kZXRlY3QtZGlzcnVwdGlvbnMtaW4tYXNzZW1ibHktb3BlcmF0aW9ucy1hdC1haXJidXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"HAMBURG, Germany—Automated assembly operations of the future will increasingly rely on close collaboration between humans and machines. Engineers at the Fraunhofer Institute for Factory Operation and Automation (IFF) are working with Airbus to learn how to detect and predict disruptions in aircraft production. They are focusing on the installation of jetliner cabin doors.

“We want to find out how we can automate and make our assembly process more streamlined,” says Eugen Gorr, an engineer in charge of the development of innovative assembly operations at Airbus’ Hamburg operations. “The operations surrounding the installation of a cabin door are particularly well suited for ascertaining which data we collect how and where, how we process them, and how we can feed them back into the assembly process in real time.

Fraunhofer IFF’s new sensor and data processing concepts are intended to enable optimized process monitoring and its incremental integration in the assembly environment.

The R&D project focused on the material delivery unit (MDU) that transports a door from the supplier to the fuselage on the Airbus assembly line. It was equipped with diverse sensors and data storage systems that supply engineers with relevant information anytime and anywhere during the entire operation.

The engineers were looking for answers to questions such as: for which airplane is the door intended? Is it a left or a right door? Did anything unusual happen during its transport that requires reinspection before installation? Has the door warmed up to the temperature of the fuselage?

“Until now, communication in assembly plants has been based more on paper documents and word of mouth, and less on digital aids,” says Martin Woitag, a research scientist in Fraunhofer IFF’s Measurement and Testing Technology Business Unit. “And since feedback on the current stage of manufacture is given only once a week, it is significantly decoupled from the time of its completion.”

Woitag and his colleagues developed a mobile sensor dubbed AirBOX. It infers relevant information from the collected data without delay in a flexible network.

“The amount of data transmitted remains so small that the wireless network in the assembly plant is not utilized more than necessary,” explains Woitag. “The AirBOX can be configured so that additional modifications in the existing infrastructure are unnecessary. It is also highly compatible with other systems.

“Although it tracks the cabin door’s location and temperature continuously, it does not send a signal to the server until the sensor data include two criteria, the correct installation location and attainment of room temperature,” notes Woitag. “Only then is the cabin door ready for installation, because it has not only been delivered but also warmed up to the temperature of the fuselage. In principle, one single bit of data suffices to notify Airbus of this event.”

The sensor data and events are stored in a local database and visualized on the web. Up to six automatically recognized and preconfigured sensors can be connected to the box to build a sensor network.

“The AirBOX opens an abundance of digitalization options that support manufacturing operations,” claims Woitag. “[In the future], it could play a role in the development of a visual assistance system for wing and fuselage assembly.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997374415397644}",neutral,0.9997374415397644,0

Donauwörth, 26 November 2020 - The German Bundeswehr has ordered 31 NH90 helicopters, to be known as Sea Tiger, for the German Navy’s shipborne operations. Nathalie Tarnaud-Laude, President of NH90 Helicopter Industries (NHI) and Giorgio Gomma, General Manager of the NATO Helicopter Management Agency (NAHEMA), on behalf of the Federal Office for Equipment, Information Technology and In-Service Support of the German Armed Forces (BAAINBw) signed the contract on 26 November. The helicopters will replace the German Navy’s Sea Lynx Mk88A fleet which entered into service in 1981. The Bundeswehr has already ordered 18 NH90 Sea Lion naval transport helicopters, seven of which have already been delivered.

""With the Sea Lion and Sea Tiger, the German Navy will have state-of-the-art, high performance helicopters and can benefit from the advantages of a harmonized fleet,"" said Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters. “We look forward to working, together with our partners, to deliver the unique naval capabilities that the NH90 NFH has to offer as early as 2025,” he added.

The widespread use of the NH90 TTH by the German Army and the NH90 NFH by the German Navy enables considerable synergies in terms of logistics and training. Naval flight crews and technical staff have already been undergoing basic NH90 training together with Army’s NH90 crews since the introduction of the Sea Lion.

Both the Sea Tiger and the Sea Lion are derivatives of the NH90 NFH. The Sea Tiger is based on the Sea Lion configuration, enhanced by mission capabilities and equipment in order to carry out their specific tasks. In addition to reconnaissance and transport, the shipborne Sea Tigers missions include engaging targets above and below the surface. For this purpose, the Sea Tiger is, amongst others, equipped with an active dipping sonar, passive sonar buoys, and weapons (torpedoes and missiles).

100 naval NH90 helicopters have already been delivered to six nations and have completed over 70,000 flight hours in search and rescue, humanitarian, and military operations. There are currently 430 NH90 helicopters in service worldwide that have accumulated over 270,000 flight hours.

Iberia deploys first converted Airbus A330 freighter | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Thu, 05 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vZmxlZXRzL2liZXJpYS1kZXBsb3lzLWZpcnN0LWNvbnZlcnRlZC1haXJidXMtYTMzMC1mcmVpZ2h0ZXIvMTQwOTgyLmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Iberia has put its first converted Airbus A330 freighter into service, operating on flights between Madrid and Los Angeles.

The Oneworld carrier says all economy and premium economy seats and the crew rest were removed along with separation panels at Iberia’s Madrid maintenance hangar. Carpeting was reinstalled with lights indicating the 33 cargo positions.

Cargo will be held in place with netting fastened to floor rails where the seats were anchored. The cabin conversion was carried out by Iberia Maintenance.

Iberia’s sales chief Maria Jesus Lopez Solas says: “We’re expecting an increase in air freight demand in coming months and this is an opportunity we should try to seize. Under today’s circumstances we must adapt better than ever to market demands, and this operation will help diversify our income streams while keeping our staff active.”

IAG Cargo, the freight division of Iberia parent IAG, will service these flights.

Revenue at IAG Cargo increased 14% in the third quarter to €302 million, the carrier disclosed at the end of October, as demand for cargo capacity increased amid reduced levels of availability on passenger aircraft.

IAG Cargo chief executive Lynne Embleton says:”The stark impact of Covid-19 on aviation continued throughout Q3. The overall market was weaker than pre-pandemic levels, but the continued squeeze on available air cargo capacity across the global market was the key dynamic in the quarter as carriers continued to ground aircraft.

“Q3 saw a significant ramp up in our network, with routes and frequencies added across the Atlantic, to Africa, Asia and the Middle East. By the end of Q3, we were operating more than 3,000 cargo flights per week and we will further develop our network into Q4.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9349930286407471}",positive,0.9349930286407471,1
Boeing vs Airbus: who develops aircraft faster? | Data - AeroTime,"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjY1MzMtYm9laW5nLXZzLWFpcmJ1cy13aG8tZGV2ZWxvcHMtYWlyY3JhZnQtZmFzdGVyLWRhdGHSAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5hZXJvdGltZS5hZXJvL2FydGljbGVzLzI2NTMzLWJvZWluZy12cy1haXJidXMtd2hvLWRldmVsb3BzLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWZhc3Rlci1kYXRhL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It takes years to develop a modern aircraft. But which one of the two giants – Boeing and Airbus – manages to do it faster?

Theoretically, it is not difficult to calculate the time it took to develop a particular model of aircraft. All we have to do is measure how many years, months or days were spent between the two points: when a particular airplane went into development and when its first production unit was delivered to the first customer.

The chart below shows how many years particular aircraft spent in the development cycle, including several significant checkpoints: the official launch of the program (often coupled with the first official order) and the first flight of the prototype. The most popular models are shown here, including significant modifications that often come with their respective generations. Aircraft, developed by other companies, but sold by Boeing or Airbus (such as the Boeing 717 and the Airbus A220) are excluded, as are modifications of particular base model (such as the Boeing 737 MAX 9 or the Airbus A321 – derivatives of the 737 MAX 8 and the A320 respectively).

There are several outliers here, such as the Boeing 777: it began its life as a trijet program in the late 70s, before being shelved for some time and reemerging as a twinjet in the early 90s.

Long development times of the Airbus A310 and the A330 also could be noted: those aircraft were developed as variants of the original A300, before acquiring the life of their own long after the initial model started flying. The A320 falls into that category too – its program had a long and wavy path between the first ideas in the early 70s and the official launch in 1984.

Nevertheless, we can outline an average development time. Unsurprisingly, Airbus aircraft spend way more time on the drawing board.

But there are many caveats to that. First, it is not easy to pinpoint the exact start of the development of some airplanes. Models often go through a myriad of changes between the first appearance on the drawing board and the first takeoff, and sometimes – even after that. The Boeing 777 that took off in 1994 was an entirely different plane at the start of its development, sharing, besides the name, very little with the original design. Can we really say that the development took a long time if it actually went through several distinct stages?

Nowhere it is as apparent as in case of Airbus. Many of its planes were based on some or another variant of the A300. As the success of the first model became apparent, those variants were stretched, reengined and otherwise overhauled. The A330neo had its share of transformations too. Proposed as an answer to the Boeing 787 in 2004, it was shelved in favor of the A350, and reborn with many different features in 2017. Did its development really take that long or was it something completely else?

In this light, we should not trust the start of the development that much. The program launch is often complicated too. Sometimes it indicates the date when the manufacturer starts selling yet-unfinished aircraft to airlines. But more often than not, airlines are involved in the development from the beginning, making the launch just a formality, not indicative of the actual state of the program.

If we want a concrete checkpoint, we should look at the first flight: an aircraft has to be finished before it flies. Actually, it has to be finished even before that, and the rollout – the first showcasing of a compleated aircraft to the public – usually signifies that date. Ground testing follows, then the maiden flight, then the flight testing.

After that, an aircraft has to be certified by respective aviation authority, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States or the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in Europe, whichever comes first. After that, the aircraft is finished and gets delivered to the launch customer, usually within a month or two.

This timeline is a lot more concrete and shows arguably the most difficult period of the development. So, how long does it take for Boeing and Airbus?

Several outliers can be seen here too. The Boeing 787, which had a lot of development problems in the early stage, and the Boeing 707, which took over four years between the first flight of Dash 80 prototype and the certification of the final production model.

These outliers are not the only ones that drag Boeing statistics down. The American company takes quite a long time to fly their prototypes and even longer to certify them.

Airbus spends more time before delivering certified aircraft to the first customer though, a process that may be impacted by their complicated international assembly lines.

Overall, it is clear that the European manufacturer likes to take its time to develop aircraft, but moves through testing and certification processes faster. Boeing, on the other hand, is less consistent between the models, but on average develops their airplanes faster, while spending more time on the processes after the first rollout. Those changes correlate with the differences between design philosophies of both companies, making each of them unique in their own right.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999942779541016}",neutral,0.9999942779541016,0
EASA and Airbus: working towards our common safety objectives - Airbus,"Wed, 04 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIwLTExLWVhc2EtYW5kLWFpcmJ1cy13b3JraW5nLXRvd2FyZHMtb3VyLWNvbW1vbi1zYWZldHktb2JqZWN0aXZlc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Safety is a uniting force among all members of the helicopter industry. Here, John Franklin, Head of Safety Promotion at the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), discusses common challenges and achievements in the field of rotary wings, and the key role Airbus has to play.

What is the reputation of helicopter transportation from the general public regarding Safety?

From a statistical perspective, Europe averages one non-fatal helicopter accident per week with a rotorcraft and 1.3 fatal accidents per month, all manufacturers considered. The rate of accidents has been almost constant for the last 10 years. The EASA Rotorcraft Roadmap was developed specifically to tackle this safety challenge. Modern media means that high profile accidents are extremely visible in the media and this reinforces a negative view of helicopters by some people.

While every accident is one too many, it’s important to remember that rotorcraft provide vital, life-saving services to our European and global society. When you consider the high risk situations that helicopter crews find themselves in every day while saving lives and supporting vital infrastructure, compared with other activities or modes of transport we can still be proud of our safety records.

What are the different roles of manufacturers, regulators and operators to improve aviation safety?

Operators, Manufacturers and Regulators are part of the same system and contribute to making the operations safe. Through the EASA Rotorcraft Committee, stakeholders from the different areas of the industry work together and coordinate our efforts.

John Franklin, Head of Safety Promotion from EASA.

Manufacturers design and build aircraft in compliance with Certification Specifications, monitor in-service fleets through quality programs, provide operators support, contribute to innovation through research and development projects, analyse data and perform safety management at fleet level, perform safety promotion and reach out to their operators to help them operate safely and effectively.

Regulators define the regulatory framework to ensure safe operation and a level playing field. This includes the definition of Certifications Specifications, Operational rules, Maintenance, Air Traffic Management, Environment Protection standards and other types of rules. In addition, EASA performs standardisation and oversight functions, certifies aircraft systems and equipment, develops rules and regulations, gathers safety intelligence and implements Safety Risk Management, contributes to R&D, performs safety promotion activities and much more.

Operators are the final part of the picture and in addition to operating both safely and effectively, they have a part to play in implementing Safety Management principles at the local level to identify hazards and manage local risks to keep them acceptable. Some also perform maintenance work and deliver training.

There are other important actors in the system. These include maintenance organisations, Universities (Academia) and Training Organisations, ANSPs, ATC and FIS, EUROCONTROL, Research Institutes, Associations like EHA, HAI, HeliOffshore, FSF, RaeS, GASCo and safety partnerships like IHSF (formerly IHST) and ESPN-R (formerly EHEST) in Europe. All have complementary roles to play!

What are the main challenges to improve aviation safety in the helicopter industry?

First, it’s perhaps useful to outline where the information comes from to identify these challenges and how we use that information to identify and act on the strategic safety challenges. Every year EASA publishes the Annual Safety Review (ASR) which provides an overview of the accident statistics from the previous 10 years. The European Safety Risk Management (SRM) process involves a collaborative approach with the helicopter industry to assess accidents and other safety occurrences reported by operators to help determine both the main safety challenges and also the most appropriate mitigations. The involvement of industry in this work is vital and the process relies on the occurrence reports that operators submit to help identify the causes and mitigations at a strategic level.

The analysis shows that in terms of accident prevention, the main focus is on reducing the following accident types: Aircraft upset / loss of control, terrain collisions, airborne collisions, and obstacle collisions in flight.

To help counter these safety challenges the EASA Rotorcraft Roadmap focuses on six safety pillars that will help us work together across the industry to improve safety. The first pillar is “Design and maintenance”: to help reduce the likelihood of critical technical failures leading to accidents. The next one is “Training and operations”: to help tackle the operational side of accidents. Given that a number of accidents occur during flight training, we are working to increase the use of simulators that can enable pilots to perform critical emergency manoeuvres in a safe environment. There are also pillars on “Safety Management” to help us manage our risks in a more coordinated manner and this links also to another pillar titled “Be more integrated and efficient”. Finally, there are two closely linked pillars to help us harness the power of technology to improve safety: these cover “Research and innovation” and “Encourage and facilitate new technologies.”

Which have been the main achievements in this field in the recent years?

There have been many improvements that are worth mentioning and Airbus is one of our key safety partners in this activity. In particular there have been some fantastic achievements in design and maintenance, training (classroom, in-flight and simulator training), operations and safety management. As a manufacturer, Airbus has a key role to play in bringing new technologies with safety benefits into operational use and there are many different enhancements that have helped to improve safety. On the safety management front, the “Before your flight” app from Airbus has been a vital step forward in helping operators to identify and manage risks prior to take off.

The level of industry collaboration in the helicopter industry is another key achievement. Airbus Helicopters has been vital in helping EASA to bring together industry stakeholders at global and European levels to discuss our priorities and to develop practical solutions. We are very grateful for the active role that Gilles Bruniaux, Matthias Klein and their teams play in our different activities such as the Rotorcraft Committee and the European Safety Promotion Network – Rotorcraft, which is co-chaired by Bernd Osswald. Airbus Helicopters has also been instrumental in working with EASA and other manufacturers to organise worldwide safety seminars and workshops that have greatly benefited the whole industry.

As a manufacturer, Airbus has a key role to play in bringing new technologies with safety benefits into operational use and there are many different enhancements that have helped to improve safety.

- John Franklin, Head of Safety Promotion at EASA

Which kind of helicopter accidents are easier to prevent?

There is a saying that there are no new accidents, just new people waiting to have the same accidents all over again. While this is not strictly true of course, our safety analysis highlights some common themes in the various accident scenarios that are perhaps easier to prevent than others.

When it comes to weather events , it is often difficult to say no to a flight despite challenging conditions that may reduce the safety margins. Use the Airbus “Before your flight” app to help identify when the situation might require you to take the hard decision to stay on the ground. Airbus’ Bruce Webb has done some great videos on this subject. Good weather planning coupled with effective decision making is very important.

For loss of control , as mentioned earlier, we see a number of accidents in training that could have been prevented through more widespread use of simulators for certain emergency manoeuvres in particular. This subject will feature in an EASA Safety Promotion campaign later in the year – be sure to join the Together4Safety Rotorcraft Community website to stay in touch with this work and other developments. Manufacturers have helped a great deal already in encouraging more use of simulator training.

Potentially the biggest area where manufacturers can influence is with regard to technology advances. In fixed wing flying we have seen the number of CFIT accidents reduce to effectively zero thanks to the widespread use of GPWS. The more the helicopter community can benefit from this and other innovations the safer our operations will be.

How do you think the VTOL developments for UAM will change the approach to aviation safety for regulators?

The new generation of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft with distributed electrical or hybrid propulsion systems opens up the prospect of a growing volume of Urban Air Mobility operations. The industry is working actively on the technical challenges and the regulators are developing new concepts to enable the safe operation of these new aircraft.

Not only the aircraft are different but also the business models and the way they will operate. Moreover the technologies involved will evolve quickly. So, the rules need to be written in a way that enable this evolution and support safe improvements.

One of the main elements is the high expectation for adequate safety for such aircraft so as to secure the confidence and trust of the general public. This confidence will help the industry to grow. EASA has already published the first building blocks of the future regulatory framework and is now working on developing the technical standards.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9685768485069275}",neutral,0.9685768485069275,0
"Airbus jet trainer proposal looks beyond Spain, but may struggle for significant sales - Flightglobal","Wed, 04 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mbGlnaHRnbG9iYWwuY29tL2RlZmVuY2UvYWlyYnVzLWpldC10cmFpbmVyLXByb3Bvc2FsLWxvb2tzLWJleW9uZC1zcGFpbi1idXQtbWF5LXN0cnVnZ2xlLWZvci1zaWduaWZpY2FudC1zYWxlcy8xNDA5NjIuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An Airbus Defence & Space offer to build a clean-sheet advanced jet trainer for Spain could benefit from the requirements from the manufacturer’s other home nations, but may lack the economies of scale to compete on the global market.

Spain is seeking a replacement for its air force’s 19-strong fleet of Northrop F-5s, with initial operating capability status targeted for 2027.

Airbus believes its offer – which it calls the Airbus Future Jet Trainer (AFJT) – would offer a significant boost to Spanish industry and support thousands of jobs.

In addition, building the aircraft would help to prepare suppliers for Madrid’s contribution to the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) it is developing alongside France and Germany.

Indeed, those two nations provide the most likely follow-on customers for the development. In a presentation, the airframer specifically refers to the proposal as a “baseline with growth potential” which could become the “future trainer aircraft of FCAS/NGF” – or next-generation fighter.

France currently has a fleet of 57 Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jets its uses for training, alongside 17 new Pilatus PC-21 turboprops. Germany, on the other hand, has no jet trainer provision, instead sending fast jet students to the USA for instruction.

Even assuming that both countries had a defined requirement for new advanced jet trainers and placed double-digit orders for the Airbus jet, the AFJT would struggle to match the quantities and consequent economies of scale of other aircraft on the market.

Most obviously it would lag the Boeing T-7A Red Hawk being developed for the US Air Force. The service has a requirement for 351 examples, but with Saab a partner on the programme Sweden could also favour the T-7 for its future training need, further adding to the backlog.

But closer to home, Leonardo has sold its M-346 trainer to Israel (30), Italy (22), Poland (16) and Singapore (12), plus has received an 18-unit launch order for its smaller M-345 from Italy. Portuguese leasing specialist SkyTech has previously expressed an interest in operating a fleet of M-346 aircraft on behalf of the Portuguese air force and overseas customers.

Airbus declines to comment on the AFJT’s sales prospects outside of Spain, but its presentation refers to the jet’s “high growth capacity”, which could see it take on light attack or aggressor roles or even a “future technologies demonstrator”.

“This makes the AFJT a truly competitive training system for the future that could fulfil the requirements of customers globally,” a source indicates. It would also “outpace solutions designed several years ago”.

The single-engined AFJT would be around 13.6m (44.6ft long), with a 10m wingspan and would possess “high manoeuvrability and [a] power-to-weight ratio equivalent to top-of-the-line fighters”, according to Airbus.

Spanish companies which could participate in the programme include CESA (landing gear and actuators), GMV (software and flight systems), Indra (flight simulation and systems), ITP Aero (engines), and Tecnobit (communications systems and pilot interface).

Airbus has not specified which engine would equip the AFJT, but the power requirement is understood to be in the 11,200-13,500lb (50-60kN)-thrust range: less than the 20,000lb-thrust Eurojet EJ200 for the Eurofighter or 16,500lb-thrust Safran M88 which powers the Dassault Rafale.

ITP has a 13% stake in Eurojet, compared with the 33% held by each of Rolls-Royce and MTU, and 21% by Avio Aero. However, it is unclear if the EJ200 would provide sufficient Spanish content, particularly as ITP’s contribution is limited to external parts, notably exhaust components.

Boeing has selected the 11,000lb-thrust GE Aviation F404 for the T-7, while the M-346 uses a pair of Honeywell F124s – each rated at 6,300lb-thrust, and the M-345 a single 3,400lb-thrust Williams International FJ44.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9816761016845703}",positive,0.9816761016845703,1

These cadets underwent their first phase of training at Airbus Flight Academy Europe in Angoulême, France, which included over 750 hours in ground school, plus 200 hours of flight instruction. They will now transfer to the Airbus Training Centre in Toulouse, for jet orientation and multi-crew cockpit cooperation courses, where they can follow upwith a Type Rating.

From no flying experience to a qualified airline pilot

Ab-Initio means “from the beginning,” and thanks to the full Airbus training programme - a cadet with no flying experience can be trained and qualified as a pilot . Airbus Flight Training has the advantage of providing a single and harmonious curriculum from beginning to end - applying Airbus flight training standards, training concepts and technologies, such as competency-based training and assessment.

This nurtures a new generation of Airbus ambassadors, who will carry the Airbus pilot competencies and airmanship values, from training to commercial operations.

- Captain Jean-Michel Bigarré, Airbus Head of Flight Training Worldwide

With the launch of the programme in 2018, the Ab-Initio Pilot Cadet Training programme currently has two partner schools: the Airbus Flight Academy Europe in Angoulême; and the “Escuela de Aviación México” in Mexico City. Today, there are over 70 cadets at the two locations.

By adding the ab-initio programme to Airbus Training activities, the company supports airline customers to prepare the future generation of pilots, ensuring cadets benefit from the company’s high levels of safety, reliability and expertise. The pilot cadet programme is open worldwide for high school graduates over 18 years old.

Looking to air traffic recovery in the coming years

Airbus has been offering training courses for airline customers since its creation 50 years ago, and has always taken a comprehensive and innovative approach with the introduction of the latest technologies and learning concepts. Continuing with this forward-looking strategy, the cadet training helps prepare the pilots of tomorrow – contributing to the air transport industry’s readiness for the air traffic recovery that is anticipated during 2023-2025 timeframe.

Having joined the Airbus Flight Academy Europe 18 months ago, I have successfully passed my Commercial Pilot Licence. The training fulfilled all my expectations and despite the current situation, I am convinced that my training at the Airbus Flight Academy will be a major asset for my future in the aviation industry.

With the COVID-19 pandemic’s onset, cadets followed their training through video conferencing classroom instruction, prior to progressively returning to school with all the necessary health and safety measures in place. This remote instruction was developed by the Airbus Flight Training operation, with approval provided by Europe’s EASA airworthiness authority one day after the COVID-19 lockdown was applied in France.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9325650334358215}",positive,0.9325650334358215,1
Airbus CEO Calls For Carbon-Neutral Aircraft Incentives - Aviation Week,"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9zcGVjaWFsLXRvcGljcy9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS9haXJidXMtY2VvLWNhbGxzLWNhcmJvbi1uZXV0cmFsLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWluY2VudGl2ZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LYON, France—Future carbon-neutral commercial aircraft should benefit from a favorable tax policy to help the technology gain traction, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said.

Hydrogen, Airbus’ favored fuel option to make passenger aircraft green, will cause fuel costs to increase for carriers, at least at the beginning. Later on, the proliferation of hydrogen technology will bring down the cost, Faury said. The Airbus CEO was speaking Nov. 26 during a video debate organized by French financial daily Les Echos.

Suitable rules may help the starting phase. “What the lawmaker can do is to make conventional, carbon-based flying artificially more expensive. Or to make the final cost for the consumer or the carrier lower than it actually is with decarbonized aircraft. This would last until expansion helps them becoming competitive,” he said. He likened the hoped-for incentives to those that are helping electric cars become more popular in Europe.

“We know that, anyway, entry into service will be an economic challenge,” he emphasized.

More generally, Faury called for a regulatory framework that would foster innovation and financial risk-taking in Europe. “Fragmentation is a challenge and the current framework is, too,” he said.

But Europe may have a competitive edge in environmentally friendly technologies. Thanks to the public’s appetite, they could be developed earlier on the continent. “And we think they are the future of aviation,” Faury said.

He also explained that eVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft) projects—like the Vahana two-seater and the CityAirbus four-seater—should be primarily seen as low-cost demonstrators for future technology on commercial aircraft. “There will be a market eventually, but profitability will be tricky at the start,” he said.

He said they should be thought of as sandboxes for engineers to experiment with technologies for a small investment, with shorter development lead times and without the safety requirements of commercial aviation. If successful, the eVTOLs could later be scaled up to become passenger aircraft.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7676286697387695}",neutral,0.7676286697387695,0

A320 could lead the recovery of Mexican aviation: Airbus - MEXICONOW,"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vbWV4aWNvLW5vdy5jb20vYTMyMC1jb3VsZC1sZWFkLXRoZS1yZWNvdmVyeS1vZi1tZXhpY2FuLWF2aWF0aW9uLWFpcmJ1cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,": foreach() argument must be of type array|object, bool given inon line

MEXICO – According to Airbus, the A320 aircraft family has the potential to lead the recovery of post COVID-19 Mexican aviation, since, up to September, 45% of domestic flights were carried out in some version of these aircraft.

The European manufacturer ensures that the A320s offer operational advantages over aircraft manufactured by other companies that can help to streamline airline operations, such as a reduction of around 20% in fuel consumption and a 14% decrease in operating costs by seat.

Airbus noted as well that all aircraft manufactured by Airbus since 1994 are equipped with HEPA filters that remove up to 99.9% of particles in the air, including bacteria and viruses.

“Despite the fact that this year the aviation industry has faced an unprecedented crisis, the A320 family has demonstrated part of its versatility and the operational advantages that it offers to Mexican operators in a scenario in which the reduction of operational costs and health safety are essential for the profitability of operations, thanks to the latest generation technology in the cabs, the incorporation of Sharklets and more efficient engines,” the company explained.

Airbus Wins $19M ESA Contract to Lead TRUTHS Mission Study - Via Satellite,"Tue, 03 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhdGVsbGl0ZXRvZGF5LmNvbS9pbWFnZXJ5LWFuZC1zZW5zaW5nLzIwMjAvMTEvMDMvYWlyYnVzLXdpbnMtMTltLWVzYS1jb250cmFjdC10by1sZWFkLXRydXRocy1taXNzaW9uLXN0dWR5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus on Tuesday revealed that the company will lead the European Space Agency (ESA) contract for the Traceable Radiometry Underpinning Terrestrial and Helio Studies (TRUTHS) satellite mission, phase A /B1, which includes system feasibility studies and pre-developments. This mission is part of the larger ESA Earth Observation Earth Watch program, and the contract is worth approximately $18.7 million (16 million euros).

The TRUTHS study and pre-developments will include partners from the U.K. space industry including Teledyne e2v, National Physical Laboratory (NPL), RAL Space, University of Leicester, Thales Alenia Space, CGI IT, Telespazio, Goonhilly Satellite Earth Station, as well as other companies and institutes in the Czech Republic, Greece, Romania, and Switzerland.

The TRUTHS satellite will measure the Sun’s radiation and the sunlight reflected off of Earth’s surface, which will then be used to improve climatological data. TRUTHS will serve to calibrate other satellite sensors, such as those carried on the Copernicus missions, through co-imaging operations. TRUTHS will carry a Cryogenic Solar Absolute Radiometer (CSAR) to provide a primary calibration standard.

Richard Franklin, managing director of Airbus Defence and Space in the U.K. said: “Validating data on Earth’s changing climate is at the heart of this exciting mission — which will have a profound impact on future studies. It will provide the gold standard of calibration for space based Earth Observation (EO) — a kind of ‘standards laboratory in space.’ For the first time the international scientific community will be able to cross reference their measurements and data enabling much more accurate forecasts and analysis, especially from the European Copernicus program.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999017715454102}",neutral,0.9999017715454102,0
Airbus and OneWeb satellite production JV reactivated in Florida - - Runway Girl Network,"Sat, 21 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjAvMTEvYWlyYnVzLWFuZC1vbmV3ZWItc2F0ZWxsaXRlLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tanYtcmVhY3RpdmF0ZWQtaW4tZmxvcmlkYS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Having successfully restructured its operations and emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, OneWeb says its US satellite production joint venture facility with Airbus is back in business, building Ku-band satellites for the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellation.

Airbus and OneWeb run the 50-50 joint venture facility, OneWeb Satellites, in Florida’s Space Coast. “Due to investment decisions made by the new shareholders, the joint venture facility with Airbus in Florida, USA was reactivated and the dual production lines brought back into service,” says London-headquartered OneWeb, which is seeking to support Internet access everywhere.

The new OneWeb shareholders – a consortium led by the British Government and including India’s Bharti Global – have invested a total $1 billion of new equity to build out and own the OneWeb network, which will boast an initial 650 satellites when it is completed.

When the acquisition was announced in July, the British government – through the UK Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy – expressed an interest in enhancing advanced satellite manufacturing on home turf.

But the Florida JV factory will in fact manufacture OneWeb’s “first-generation satellites as our new shareholders are laser focused on seeing OneWeb launch commercial services as fast as possible”, a OneWeb spokeswoman explains to Runway Girl Network.

A total 74 OneWeb satellites are already in orbit. With two production lines, the high-volume satellite manufacturing facility can produce an impressive two satellites per day or one per assembly line shift. Traditional manufacturers generally take more than a year to build a single satellite.

“Airbus is still our partner in the JV and the facility has ramped up production to help OneWeb get back on track with our launches,” says the OneWeb spokeswoman.

On 17 December, a 36-satellite payload is scheduled for launch by Arianespace from the Vostochny Cosmodrome. “All the satellites have been shipped from Florida to Vostochny and are now undergoing preparation for launch,” says OneWeb.

Launches will continue throughout 2021 and 2022. OneWeb says it is now on track to begin commercial connectivity services to the UK and the Arctic region in late 2021 and will expand to delivering global services in 2022.

While OneWeb is focused on seeing its first-generation system launched and delivering services, there have been strong hints that second-generation satellites are in the offing.

In January of last year, OneWeb and partner SatixFy UK announced their intent to test an all-digital satellite payload in 2021 with the aim of directing capacity to hot-spots like busy airports. Development of a digital technology pathway payload, they said, will “pave the way for satellites with a higher level of flexibility to efficiently support peaks in demand without oversizing the constellation”.

Airline passenger experience applications will be better facilitated by the new satellite payload, as OneWeb will be able to focus on providing connectivity to “specific planes or even specific areas of planes”, SatixFy group CEO Yoel Gat told RGN at the time.

Meanwhile, in connection with the completion of its restructuring process, OneWeb has appointed Neil Masterson as CEO. Masterson formerly worked as co-chief operating officer at global news provider Thomson Reuters, where he enjoyed a 20-year career. He succeeds Adrian Steckel, who continues as an adviser to the board.

“I am looking forward to helping the OneWeb team deliver and commercialise their vision to provide Internet access across the globe. OneWeb has a strong social purpose to improve the world’s access to information, which I share. It has great talent, a compelling commercial opportunity, and is supported by committed and knowledgeable owners and investors,” says Masterson.

“Our December launch puts the UK firmly in the global space business, alongside acknowledged Indian telecoms experts, Bharti Global. OneWeb will be a model for responsible co-operation in space.”

UK Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Alok Sharma adds: “This strategic investment demonstrates Government’s commitment to the UK’s space sector in the long-term and our ambition to put Britain at the cutting edge of the latest advances in space technology.

“Access to our own global fleet of satellites has the potential to connect people worldwide, providing fast UK-backed broadband from the Shetlands to the Sahara and from Pole to Pole.”

Airbus Helicopters' 1400th H135 is delivered to HEMS operator Mont Blanc - Airbus,"Fri, 06 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIwLTExLWFpcmJ1cy1oZWxpY29wdGVycy0xNDAwdGgtaDEzNS1pcy1kZWxpdmVyZWQtdG8taGVtcy1vcGVyYXRvci1tb250LWJsYW5j0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In late September, the light twin-engine helicopter reached a major milestone: the company’s 1,400th H135 was delivered to the French operator Mont Blanc, adding to a fleet of more than 20 H135 and H145 helicopters in service with the operator to provide Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS) in France. The milestone capped off an over-20-year history for the programme and cements the H135 as a leader in the HEMS industry, currently holding 25% of the global market share for HEMS and boasting over 650 units in service.

Lives in the balance

Transferring patients from one care centre to another is a complex operation even in the best of times. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ability to transfer critical care patients has become a crucial ability that helps swing the balance in what often are life and death situations, freeing up resources for health care systems under stress.

“As the benchmark for HEMS helicopters, the H135 is the safest, most reliable and most economic platform – arriving at the scene on time…every time,” explained Martin Schneider, Airbus Helicopters’ Head of the H135 programme. “There are more than 650 H135s in emergency medical service duties, operated by thousands of pilots and medics who protect and save lives each day.”

As the benchmark for HEMS helicopters, the H135 is the safest, most reliable and most economic platform – arriving at the scene on time…every time.

- Martin Schneider, Airbus Helicopters’ Head of the H135 programme

The best fit for HEMS

Since first entering into service in 1996, the H135 family of helicopters has gone through regular improvements in performance and capabilities. In order to respond to the unique needs for HEMS operators, the programme has taken an active role by conducting conferences, interviews, questionnaires, and surveys, as well as using Reliability Data Group (RDG) customer input and reliability figures.

As operators seek to improve on-board care, adding more specialised medical equipment, which translates to increased load, the H135 team went to work. The results? The latest H135 version has an increased maximum take-off weight of 90 kg and a useful load increase of up to 225 kg, allowing HEMS operators to explore new possibilities for the care provided during transit. Other improvements have focused on the airframe, engine, and cockpit; mission equipment; maintenance and reliability, to name a few.

Mont Blanc’s latest H135 rotorcraft benefits from an increased maximum take-off weight, as well as a boost in its useful load.

Focus on safety and performance in critical missions

From the operational point of view, Airbus’ introduction of the Helionix avionics suite – which was exclusively designed for helicopters, and includes a 4-axis autopilot – reduces pilot workload, increases situational awareness and enhances overall flight safety. Helionix also is night-vision ready, further augmenting mission capabilities and safety when the H135 is operated in darkness or in low visibility conditions.

As an environmentally-friendly rotorcraft, the H135 is the most efficient in terms of CO2 emissions, as well as the quietest in its category of helicopters.

More than five decades of HEMS expertise

Benefitting from over five decades of HEMS experience, Airbus provides much more than just highly capable rotorcraft. Working with established partners, it defines best-fit equipment and systems solutions that are tailored to customers’ specific requirements, as well as supporting operators in establishing their business models.

Additionally, Airbus offers services and solutions based on its extensive experience in HEMS. They range from assessing a country’s specific needs, conducting workshops, organising medical and operational training programmes, all the way to providing in-country on-the-ground support.

The Airbus Foundation also plays a role by sponsoring dedicated training programmes with HEMS doctors from the French Academy of Medicine Foundation (FAM). In 2019, the Airbus Foundation and FAM trained nearly 215 doctors and rescue personnel in India, China and Indonesia. Overall more than 1,100 professionals from around the world have benefited from this initiative.

Versatile for a wide range of missions

Overall, H135s are operated for a wide range of missions by more than 290 customers in 65 countries. In addition to HEMS, this helicopter family is deployed for law enforcement, private and business aviation, offshore windfarm management, and military flight training.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9997947812080383}",positive,0.9997947812080383,1
Will Southwest Airlines Consider Acquiring The Airbus A220? - Aviation Week,"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L2FpcmxpbmVzLWxlc3NvcnMvd2lsbC1zb3V0aHdlc3QtYWlybGluZXMtY29uc2lkZXItYWNxdWlyaW5nLWFpcmJ1cy1hMjIw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ask the Editors: The Aviation Week Network invites our readers to submit questions to our editors and analysts. We’ll answer them, and if we can’t we’ll reach out to our wide network of experts for advice.

With the slow return of the Boeing 737 MAX, will Southwest Airlines entertain the Airbus A220 aircraft?

Aviation Week Regulatory and Air Transport Editor Ben Goldstein answers:

Southwest executives have confirmed that there is a review underway of both the A220—formerly the Bombardier C Series—and the 737-7 as potential fleet additions, noting the need for an airplane in the 140-150-seat range.

“The A220 and the MAX 7, they are the two players in the [150-seat] marketplace, and both of those airplanes have their strengths and their disadvantages,” Southwest Chief Operating Officer Mike Van de Ven said Oct. 29 on an earnings call. “We’ve been looking at both airplanes. We’ll continue that evaluation.”

This is not the first time Southwest executives have flirted with the possibility of diversifying the carrier’s all-737 fleet. In October 2019, the company said it planned a strategic fleet diversification review for 2020—in light of the continued challenges afflicting the 737 MAX. Back in 2011, the carrier briefly entertained a possible purchase of Airbus A320neos before opting instead for the MAX.

In deciding whether to diversify away from the 737 family, Southwest must weigh the pros of a dual fleet against the cons of added complexity and higher labor, maintenance and training costs that would come along with the addition of another fleet type.

“When we look at it, it just may be economically and operationally infeasible,” Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said in 2019. “And vice versa, we may find that . . . it is better to have two airplanes, economically and operationally.”

Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia has called a potential A220 purchase by Southwest a “heart attack scenario” for Boeing, which could prompt the OEM to reconsider its entire narrowbody strategy.

“There’s just too much at stake here, and it’s not just Southwest,” Aboulafia says. “It’s the people who look up to Southwest as the most consistently profitable airline in history and consider following them.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998979568481445}",neutral,0.9998979568481445,0
Report: End Of The Line For American's Premium Airbus A321T Transcon - View from the Wing,"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS9yZXBvcnQtZW5kLW9mLXRoZS1saW5lLWZvci1hbWVyaWNhbnMtcHJlbWl1bS1haXJidXMtYTMyMXQtdHJhbnNjb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Perennial American Airlines leaker JonNYC flags that there are active discussions around what to do with the Airbus A321T premium configured fleet and suggests that there’s a plan to rip out the interiors and replace them with the standard domestic ‘Oasis’ offering.

The A321T offers 10 first class, 20 business class, 36 Main Cabin Extra (extra legroom coach) and 36 economy seats and is used on premium cross country routes. Moving to ‘Oasis’ would mean these planes would lose seat back television, a lot more seats would be squeezed in, and there would no longer be a lie flat business class or first class product.

I think I'm now hearing A321T will be Oasis'd, 190 seat config. — JonNYC (@xJonNYC) November 30, 2020

To be clear, he flags this as unconfirmed so it may not come to fruition. And update an American spokesperson offers “we have no plans to modify those aircraft. We look forward to bringing them back just as they are today when the time is right.” But it it does happen this would have to mean,

Turning Airbus A321Ts into ‘standard’ A321s



Folding them into the rest of the narrowbody fleet



Taking available widebody aircraft and using those for premium domestic routes



American Airlines Airbus A321T First Class

This would be a sad development. American’s Airbus A321T is ‘special’ with just 102 seats, including a true first class that’s just one seat on either side of the aisle. It was developed under legacy American Airlines management and when US Airways took over they were highly skeptical of the premium configuration. One legacy US Airways Vice President told me the configuration wouldn’t last, even before it took its first flight. However they learned pre-Covid that it was actually a smart move.



American Airlines Airbus A321T Business Class

For several years American Airlines has been on a quest for ‘simplification’ or more standardization, from fewer subfleets to fewer customized meals for specific routes. This would aid in reducing the number of subfleets they operate.

And they have plenty of widebodies available, with less international flying than ever before. Moreover most of passenger demand today is lowest-fare coach, rather than premium heavy business travel. It wouldn’t surprise me if American saw demand being far more at the back of the plane than the front. American’s Boeing 777-200s and Boeing 787s skew heavy on coach, light on business class while the A321T requires premium demand. Their 787-8s have just 20 business class seats out of 234 total seats.

Using widebodies for routes like New York – Los Angeles and San Francisco still gives the airline a lie flat business class seat. It also gives them a premium economy to sell. There’s no separate first class, and that’s fed much of access to Flagship First Dining facilities at both New York JFK and San Francisco.



American Airlines Boeing 787-9 ‘Super Diamond’ Business Class

Another option once American receives their Airbus A321XLR, expected to operate short transatlantics with a lie flat business class, could run on these routes.

What happens to those is an open question, whether American re-opens them and if so whether they focus more on monetizing access on a per-trip basis rather than bundling them with ‘Flagship First’ tickets.

Before Covid-19 the airline planned only to spruce up the cabin and replace worn items not offer an improved product. Now it looks like the true premium configuration subfleet’s days may be numbered.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999682903289795}",neutral,0.9999682903289795,0

Hi Fly, an Aircraft, Crew, Maintenance and Insurance (ACMI) operator, took delivery of its first, and only, Super Jumbo in July 2018. Previously, the aircraft belonged to Singapore Airlines (SIA1) (SINGY) and was the third Airbus A380 the airline phased out.

“The decision to not extend the initial agreed lease period came as a consequence of the covid-19 pandemic, that drastically reduced the demand for very large aircraft,” read the airline’s statement released on November 3, 2020. The company plans to replace the Airbus A380 with additional Airbus A330 aircraft, which is “a smaller and more adequate aircraft for current market conditions,” commented Hi Fly.

The company was one of 15 airlines that ever operated the Super Jumbo. However, with the breakout of coronavirus and the subsequent halt of international travel, many have shied away from using the aircraft type, including many airlines who permanently withdrew the double-decker from service.

Registered as 9H-MIP, the double-decker was dedicated to operate charter flights or provide additional capacity for various airlines under wet-lease agreements. For example, Norwegian Air Shuttle was one of the airlines that wet-leased Hi Fly’s A380 in Summer 2019, when the low-cost carrier ran into trouble with its Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the Rolls-Royce TRENT 1000 engine.

Most recently, the aircraft was converted to carry cargo in its passenger cabin, Hi Fly announced on July 7, 2020.

Hi Fly’s phase-out of the A380 seemingly closed the second-hand market for the aircraft before it even opened. The 14-year-old jet was the only aircraft that switched operators after its initial operator withdrew it from service. The Portuguese also planned to take up another ex-Singapore Airlines A380 (registered as 9V-SKB), according to planespotters.net. The plans never materialized, as the jet was returned to its lessor, Dr. Peters Group.

On October 29, 2020, Emirates airline, the biggest operator of the aircraft type in the world, confirmed that it has retired its first Airbus A380 aircraft.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9892550706863403}",neutral,0.9892550706863403,0

Estimated reading time 14 minutes, 26 seconds.

The global airline industry began 2020 anticipating strong growth and robust profitability. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments imposed draconian travel restrictions that included border closures and mandatory quarantines. As the contagion spread, customer confidence was crushed. This resulted in a precipitous drop in passenger traffic and devastating financial performance.

In their efforts to minimize cash outflows, airlines have been shrinking their networks by reducing frequencies on routes and dropping destinations. This has lead to the premature retirement of aircraft types, the storage of surplus airplanes, deferred deliveries of new equipment and order cancellations.

The fiscal quarter ended Sept. 30 is traditionally the most profitable for Canadian airlines. Given Air Canada’s significant position, its Q3/20 results were likely an accurate proxy for the industry’s current state of financial health. During that period, Air Canada experienced a 91 per cent decline in passenger traffic (revenue passenger miles flown) from the year-earlier quarter. Revenues were down 86 per cent year-over-year and a massive operating loss was incurred.

Despite the turmoil, the Airbus A220 family continues to grow as more units are delivered. In order to determine how the aircraft has been performing and utilized during this perilous period, Skies approached three airlines that have played key roles in the aircraft’s short history: Swiss International Air Lines, the first carrier to fly both the A220-100 and the larger A220-300; airBaltic, the first airline to standardize its fleet on the type; and Air Canada, the first Canadian customer to operate the homegrown design.

Swiss International Air Lines

On June 30, 2016, Swiss International was the first customer to take delivery of an A220-100. It received its first A220-300 on May 27, 2017, and thus became the first airline to operate both variants. Today, it has nine A220-100s and 20 A220-300s.

Marco Lipp, a Swiss spokesperson, told Skies that all 29 of its A220s have been flying throughout the pandemic. He noted that since the current winter timetable has approximately 25 per cent less capacity than that of 2019, the A220 fleet’s daily utilization is “roughly four hours per aircraft.” As for the dispatch reliability, he said it has “increased constantly and has reached our internal target.”

Pictured is a table that details the orders and deliveries for the A220 family, last updated Nov. 26, 2020. Table Courtesy of Frederick K. Larkin

Asked what the A220’s most important attribute during the pandemic has been, Lipp said, “Flexibility to fly short and mid-long routes in combination with a good short-field performance, and the unmatched efficiency, which allows us to keep our routes open.”

Regarding stage lengths, Swiss has been using its A220-100s on routes as short as Zurich-Geneva (125 nautical miles) and as long as Zurich-Lisbon (930 nm). The larger A220-300 has also flown the Zurich-Geneva hop, as well as longer routes including Zurich-Kiev (900 nm) and Zurich-Moscow (1,190 nm).

In an effort to lower operating costs, Swiss said its short- and medium-haul flights during the 2020/21 winter period “will be operated solely with its more efficient Airbus A220 fleet and its new-engine-option or ‘neo’ Airbus A320 and A321 aircraft.” This strategic move is a resounding confirmation of the airliner’s key attributes.

airBaltic

The Riga, Latvia-based carrier was the first customer to receive an A220-300 when it was delivered on Nov. 29, 2016. Four years later it has 23 units and has been operating all of them during the pandemic. Before COVID-19, airBaltic had been operating its A220s on both short runs such as Riga-Tallinn (152 nm) and on its longest route, Riga-Abu Dhabi (2,360 nm). Daily utilization had been as high as 18 hours.

The pandemic has forced many of its longer services to be curtailed. For example, in October 2020 the airline operated 51 routes – 27 per cent fewer than the 78 flown during the same month in 2019. This November, the longest scheduled route flown was Riga-Reykjavik (1,410 nm). The longest distance covered by an airBaltic A220 during the pandemic was the 2,460 nm between Riga and Urumqi, People’s Republic of China. Three special cargo missions were flown back in March and April to collect face masks and respirators.

For airBaltic, the most important feature of the A220-300 during the pandemic has been the aircraft’s high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter system. “The quality of cabin air is carefully controlled and is recirculated 20-30 times per hour.”

Since May 18, 2020, airBaltic’s fleet has been standardized on the A220-300. With another 27 on order and options for an additional 30, the carrier could potentially have 80 in service later this decade. A return to pre-COVID-19 economic conditions would likely have to exist.

“The A220-300 has performed beyond the company’s expectations, delivering better overall performance, fuel efficiency and convenience for both passengers and the staff,” airBaltic’s corporate communications team said.

Air Canada

The Canadian flag carrier took delivery of its first A220-300 on Dec. 23, 2019. Its first revenue flight followed on Jan. 16, 2020. Since then, the company has operated more than 4,000 scheduled flights with the type. Its 12th example was delivered on Nov. 20, and an additional three are due by the end of 2020.

During the pandemic, Air Canada has been operating all of its A220-300s. Typical daily utilization has ranged between nine and 10.5 hours. Kevin O’Connor, Air Canada’s vice-president of system operations control, said the aircraft have been “operating up to expectations,” and the type’s “right size and range capability” have been the most important attributes during this extraordinary period.

The carrier’s BCS3s have been deployed on shorter routes such as Montreal-Toronto (275 nm); Halifax-Toronto (700 nm) and Winnipeg-Toronto (815 nm). They have also been stretching their legs on longer domestic runs including Toronto-Edmonton (1,455 nm), Montreal-Calgary (1,625 nm) and Toronto-Vancouver (1,810 nm).

Air Canada had originally ordered 45 units, but the pandemic has caused the company to cancel 12 of those. It had planned to have 33 units in service by then end of 2021, with another 18 arriving during that year. Now, 12 are to be delivered through 2021, with the final six due by November 2022.

A220 Demand vs Supply

On Oct. 22, Airbus delivered the first A220 produced at its Mobile, Ala., facility. The aircraft, an A220-300, was the first of 50 for Delta Air Lines. Delta became the second carrier to operate both A220 variants, as it also has received 38 of the 45 A220-100s it ordered.

In its Q3/20 financial report, Delta mentioned that it had restructured its Airbus order book “in an effort to better match the timing of aircraft deliveries with our network and financial needs.”

These deferrals, along with the previously mentioned deferrals and cancellations by Air Canada, have affected the Airbus operations. Prior to the pandemic, the Airbus plant at Mirabel, Que., was producing four A220s per month on its two final assembly lines. In response to the airline industry’s contraction, the rate has been reduced to three units per month. Airbus Canada spokesperson Annabelle Duchesne told Skies, “This rate adaptation is necessary given that the crisis is deepening and recovery is being pushed out.”

Meanwhile, the facility at Mobile is set to produce one unit per month for the foreseeable future. Longer term, the expectation remains for A220 production to eventually ramp up to the maximum rate of 10 units per month at Mirabel and four per month at Mobile.

Powerplant Progress

On Oct. 25, 2019, Transport Canada issued an emergency airworthiness directive (AD) that ordered the A220’s Pratt & Whitney PW1500G engines to be limited to 94 per cent of maximum thrust above 29,000 feet. Air Canada had not been operating its BCS3s above Flight Level 290 since then.

Thankfully, Pratt & Whitney recently released a software update that automates the existing PW1500G manual engine rotor speed limits. This replaced the previously issued AD that had mandated the manual engine rotor speed limitation.

Now, Air Canada’s A220s are flown at altitudes up to 37,000 feet, where they experience improved fuel efficiency and can take advantage of cooperative winds.

Pinstriped Performer

Despite being in the midst of a global pandemic that is wreaking havoc on the commercial airline industry, Airbus recently introduced a corporate jet version of its smallest airliner. Named “ACJ TwoTwenty,” the new variant is targeted at what the airframer refers to as the “Xtra Large Bizjet” market segment. It is essentially an A220-100 with five supplemental fuel tanks that should enable the aircraft to travel 5,650 nm during half a day.

The cabin’s 786-square-foot floor space can be customized to include six zones that could be configured with lounges, meeting spaces and a private stateroom. When fully furnished, the unit price of this special aircraft will likely be approximately US$70 million. Comlux Aviation of Zurich will be completing the first 15 examples at its facility in Indianapolis, Ind. So far, six orders have been received for the ACJ TwoTwenty, including two from Comlux Aviation.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9824470281600952}",negative,0.9824470281600952,-1
Five-bladed Airbus H145 receives FAA type certification - Vertical Magazine,"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2ZpdmUtYmxhZGVkLWFpcmJ1cy1oMTQ1LXJlY2VpdmVzLWZhYS10eXBlLWNlcnRpZmljYXRpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The new five-bladed H145 helicopter has received its certification from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). This type certification covers the full range of capabilities, including single-pilot instrument flight rules (IFR) and single engine operations (Cat.A/VTOL), along with night vision goggle capability. This newest version of the H145 family received EASA certification this past summer and was delivered to launch customer Norwegian Air Ambulance Foundation in September. The first five-bladed H145 delivery in the U.S. is set to take place in early 2021.

“The FAA certification is an important milestone for the H145 program, as our customers in North America are eagerly awaiting its arrival and our entire team looks forward to delivering and supporting this new variant,” said Romain Trapp, president of Airbus Helicopters, Inc. and head of the North America region. “We’d like to sincerely thank the FAA and everyone else who has contributed to achieving this certification through the various challenges that 2020 has presented to us all in the aviation industry.”

Airbus Helicopters, Inc. has begun updates to the current H145 final assembly line (FAL) in Columbus, Mississippi, with new wiring testing capabilities for the five-blade variant. Technicians are also undergoing training in preparation for receipt of the first kits of the new version later this year.

This latest upgrade of the H145 family adds a new, innovative five-bladed rotor system to the multi-mission H145, increasing the useful load of the helicopter by 330 lbs (150 kg). The simplicity of the new bearingless main rotor design will also simplify maintenance operations, further improving the benchmark serviceability and reliability of the H145, while improving ride comfort for both passengers and crew.

Powered by two Safran Arriel 2E engines, the H145 is equipped with full authority digital engine control (FADEC) and Airbus’s own Helionix digital avionics suite. It includes a high performance 4-axis autopilot, increasing safety and reducing pilot workload. This helicopter’s particularly low acoustic footprint makes the H145 the quietest helicopter in its class.

The new version of Airbus’s best-selling H145 light twin-engine helicopter was unveiled at Heli- Expo 2019 in Atlanta with launch customers announced for almost every market segment. During its high-altitude test campaign in South America, the H145 set its skids down on the Aconcagua, the highest mountain in the Southern hemisphere, further proving its capabilities even in harsh conditions.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9977172613143921}",positive,0.9977172613143921,1

The order is valued at €5.5 billion.

Members of the Bundestag, the German Parliament, had given their approval on November 6, 2020. The order, also known as the Quadriga project, is now a reality. It covers the delivery of 30 single-seater and 8 two-seater aircraft. “Three of the aircraft will be equipped with additional test installations as Instrumented Test Aircraft for the further development of the Eurofighter programme,” explains the manufacturer.

The new Typhoons will replace the Tranche 1 air superiority variant currently operating within the Luftwaffe. “The new Tranche 4 Eurofighter is currently the most modern European-built combat aircraft with a service life well beyond 2060,” Dirk Hoke, CEO Airbus Defence and Space, said. “Its technical capabilities will allow full integration into the European Future Combat Air System,” Airbus and Dassault Aviation’s project to replace both the Typhoon and the Rafale by 2040.

The contract from Germany secures production until 2030, according to Airbus. The delivery of the fourth-generation fighter jets should start from 2025.

The 38 fighters are the first installment of Germany’s long-term acquisition plan of 93 Typhoons from Airbus, 30 Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets, and 15 of the variant for electronic warfare, the EA-18G Growler. The decisions on the remaining should be voted in the German parliament throughout 2021.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998770952224731}",neutral,0.9998770952224731,0
Cessna Citation exhaust gasses almost downed Vueling Airbus A320 - AeroTime,"Tue, 03 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjYzMDAtaW5jYXBhY2l0YXRpb24tdnVlbGluZy1haXJidXMtYTMyMC1yZXBvcnTSAVZodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZXJvdGltZS5hZXJvL2FydGljbGVzLzI2MzAwLWluY2FwYWNpdGF0aW9uLXZ1ZWxpbmctYWlyYnVzLWEzMjAtcmVwb3J0L2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"France’s Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA) final report looked into how a Vueling Airlines Airbus A320 crew was partially incapacitated during a routine flight from Geneva Airport (GVA), Switzerland, to Barcelona-El Prat Airport (BCN), Spain.

The aircraft (registered as EC-HQJ) began its flight at 08:41 AM local time (UTC +1) on November 17, 2017. As it taxied to GVA runway 05, the Airbus A320 was behind a Cessna Citation Excel, a business jet belonging to NetJets. Air Traffic Control (ATC) instructed both aircraft to hold their positions at the designation hold area near runway 05.

At 08:51, the Cessna departed for its intended destination. A minute later, ATC cleared the Vueling A320 to take off from GVA, which it proceeded to do. At that point in time, the flight crew did not notice any irregularities regarding their oxygen supply or the quality of air in the cabin. However, four minutes after the take-off and following the retraction of the landing gear, both pilots discussed “thick exhaust gases emitted by the Cessna Citation.”

According to the BEA’s report released on November 3, 2020, the captain, who was the pilot flying, felt “almost nauseous,” while the first officer, the pilot monitoring, added that there “was a very strong smell.” The crew, still in contact with Geneva’s ATC, asked what kind of Cessna Citation preceded them, to which ATC replied that there was no traffic in front of them. The captain answered that there had been a Cessna Citation prior to departure and said he would file a report due to odors in the cockpit. As the ATC informed on the type of aircraft that was ahead of them prior to the take-off, both pilots indicated that they did not feel well. Subsequently, the captain proposed to increase the air intake to clear up the air in the cabin.

Possible incapacitation

Seven minutes after taking off, the Vueling Airbus A320 was transferred to the Marseilles en-route control center and proceeded to climb to Flight Level (FL) 290. Shortly thereafter, the crew called in the purser of the flight and asked whether he experienced any weird smells inside the main cabin, to which the purser replied negatively. The captain of the A320 proceeded to ask the purser to leave the cabin door open and for the cabin crew to watch both pilots in case something went south.

The four-striped pilot informed his colleague that he once again felt nauseous, to which the first officer responded by deploying the oxygen masks in the cabin. The captain put on his mask, while the FO proceeded to go to the toilet. After he came back, the captain asked his crewmate how he felt. While the pilot responded that he previously had felt nauseous, he was “feeling a little better” at that point, noted the French investigators.

After a brief discussion in the cockpit over their choice of an alternative airport, the crew decided that if an emergency occurred, they would attempt an emergency landing at Marseille Provence Airport (MRS). While the BEA did not highlight a worsening condition of either of the pilots, the first officer put on his oxygen mask and a minute after he did so, the crew declared PAN PAN and asked ATC to divert to Marseilles, France.

At 9:30 AM local time (UTC +1), the crew did not identify any abnormalities regarding their health. Six minutes after, the crew proceeded to land at the French airport without any incident. Emergency services met the Airbus A320 at the apron and both pilots were taken to the hospital in order to conduct blood tests to check whether the pilots experienced carbon monoxide poisoning. Following the testing and a brief monitoring period, the hospital workers released the captain and the first officer from the hospital.

The blood tests did not indicate anything out of the norm, while no other toxicological analysis was conducted, noted the BEA. However, nausea and dizziness continued for a few days, including periods of respite, added the French agency.

Confusion leading to hypotheses

The BEA, aiming to pinpoint the reason behind the partial incapacitation, raised a few hypotheses. A hypothesis of food poisoning was rejected almost immediately, as the crew had not experienced digestive problems and the symptoms appeared following reports of weird odors inside the cockpit. Contamination of air following de-icing was also ruled out, as there was no de-icing event conducted at the time of departure. The investigators were still left with a puzzle.

Maintenance staff located at the airport carried out a task, designated by the aircraft manufacturer, to search for a potential source of the cabin odor. Called the TSM Task 05-50-00-810-831-A – Identification of the Cause of Cabin Odors or Smoke in the Airbus A320 manual, the task usually looks at the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), both engines, bird strikes, issues with the aircraft’s air conditioning packs (PACK 1 & PACK 2) as a potential cause of odor or smoke in the cabin. The TSM Task did not indicate anything abnormal, nor did subsequent engine tests conducted by engineers on the ground. Few days following the incident, the Airbus A320 was given a C-Check. The scheduled 20-month service checkup, with particular attention given to the leak tightness of the seals which confine the lubricants of the rotating parts of the engines and the APU, revealed that everything was in order.

Attention shifted to the Cessna Citation.The BEA indicated that the business jet entered into maintenance on August 16, 2020, and was released back into service on September 29, 2017, not long before the incident took place. The right-hand engine of the aircraft was removed and Pratt & Whitney, the manufacturer of the PW545C engine on the jet, conducted scheduled maintenance on the turbofan.

Following interviews with the NetJets’ flight crew, a request to find a potential oil leak, and no items in the Aircraft Technical Log, the investigators once again hit a dead end. Even a special event, namely that the metal chip detector on the left-hand engine was activated on November 19, 2017, showcased nothing. The event was recorded in the Cessna Citation Excel’s technical log and an oil sample was tested. Again, the investigators found that everything was good under the engine’s hood.

The French accident investigators then proceeded to look into the possibility of air contamination from the outside.

Exhaust gasses

The Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) data revealed that there was a connection between the two pilots experiencing an odd odor in the cockpit and the Cessna Citation being in front of them. The Airbus A320 stood behind the private jet for nearly four minutes.

Both aircraft engines are located at an approximate height of two meters above the ground. Thus, with the Vueling aircraft holding for nearly four minutes in front of the Cessna, the conditions made it possible that a concentration of exhaust gasses formed up in front of the Airbus narrow-body. Subsequently, the exhaust gasses could have been taken in by the CFM56-5B engines. Combined with the fact that the air in the cockpit and cabin are different, and 60% of the air in the cockpit comes from the Pressurization Air Conditioning Kit (PACK) 1 located in the left-hand engine when the cross-bleed valve is closed, and the faster air circulation in the cockpit, there was a possibility that exhaust gasses had a greater concentration in the flight deck, rather than the main cabin. Thus, this could have been the reason why the purser could not identify any kind of odor in the part of the metal tube where passengers are usually sat.

In addition, the Cessna Citation’s metal chip detector alerted its flight crew about a potential issue on the left-hand engine, the same engine where PACK 1 is located on the Airbus A320.

The negative results at the hospital could be explained by the elapsed time between the potential poisoning and the testing, in addition to the usage of oxygen masks by the pilots. Nevertheless, the crew described the smell as acrid and acidic, which is usually associated with Nitrogen oxide (NOx) and Sulfur dioxide (SO2). Both gasses are emitted as a result of the combustion process onboard an aircraft, read the BEA’s report. The investigators also looked into a possible contamination by tricresyl phosphate (TCP), which sometimes could also turn into tri ortho-cresyl phosphate (ToCPs). The chemicals are found in engine oil, which can sometimes leak into the compression system. Once again, no contamination was found after samples from various aircraft filters were sent to an independent laboratory.

Even after sampling the crew’s hair for possible contamination, once again the results left the investigators empty-handed.

“Despite the wide range of actions undertaken, the investigation was not able to factually identify what caused the flight crew’s symptoms and physical discomfort,” concluded the BEA. The most likely hypothesis was that the crew inhaled an excessive amount of gasses from the Cessna Citation’s exhaust system, read the investigation report.

“However, it cannot be excluded that the crew were intoxicated by another substance which either quickly disappeared or which was not specifically searched for in the samples [taken from the aircraft],” added BEA.

Basis to investigate

The lesson to be learned here, concludes the report, is the fact that investigators cannot act alone in cases where the quality of cabin air is questioned. The usage of prior accepted agreements between airlines, airports and emergency services would allow emergency services to immediately conduct medical examinations, leading to a more definitive conclusion later on.

A fatal example of an incapacitated crew could be Helios Airways Flight 552, whereupon the crew of a Boeing 737 flying from Larnaca, Cyprus, to Prague, Czechia, via Athens, Greece, became incapacitated. The crucial difference between the two incidents was the fact that the Helios Airways crash was related to the loss of cabin pressure onboard.

The loss of cabin pressure stemmed from the fact that the airline’s pilots failed to recognize that the pressurization system was set to manual mode. They failed to identify the true nature of the problem and crashed just outside of Athens, Greece. While the conditions were different, the end result could have been potentially fatal for people onboard Vueling flight VY6204.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999980092048645}",neutral,0.999980092048645,0
Meet the Beluga: Airbus's Flying Whale of a Cargo Plane - The National Interest Online,"Sun, 22 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3QvbWVldC1iZWx1Z2EtYWlyYnVzcy1mbHlpbmctd2hhbGUtY2FyZ28tcGxhbmUtMTcyOTgz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As Airbus’ first oversize cargo plane the Beluga provides a crucial function—and can be seen from miles away.

Here's What You Need to Know: The Beluga has transported components for the International Space Station, large pieces of industrial machinery, and even other planes and helicopters.

Airbus is a truly pan-European corporation, and as such has production facilities in Spain, France, Germany, the United Kingdom—not to mention the United States, Canada, and China. Final assembly of Airbus airframes generally takes place in various centers in Europe.

Due to the decentralized nature of production, parts for Boeing airframes are shipped across Europe—a time-consuming and expensive process that was historically done by road transport, or rail when possible. Rail and road transport are not ideal—they’re slow, and expensive. In the late 1980s and 1990s, Airbus needed something big enough to transport their components by air.

Super Guppy

There was one option—the American-built Super Guppy oversize transport, built by Aero Spacelines of California. As I previously wrote, the Super Guppy was an elongated, large-domed airframe that NASA had contracted to transport bulky parts for the Apollo program and other missions from the West Coast to Florida, for final assembly at Cape Canaveral.

The Super Guppy design was based on a C-97J Turbo Stratocruiser—a Boeing design. Boeing was, and remains, Airbus’ arch-rival. But they had what Airbus needed.

The Super Guppy airframes were based on 1940s-era passenger airline airframes. By the 1980s they had started showing their age. So, Airbus decided to drop the Guppies in favor of their own design, tailored to Airbus needs.

Big Beluga

Airbus settled on the Airbus A300, a capable and proven wide-body airliner that originally debuted in the mid-1970s. Engineers got to work modifying the A300 for oversize cargo transport.

The A300’s nose and cockpit were lowered slightly to give loading crews straight-in access to the cargo bay, which cut down loading and unloading times. The other advantage to a lowered immovable cockpit is that the Beluga does not have to disconnect electrical and flight systems between loads, which greatly reduces loading and unloading time.

The top of the fuselage was expanded to twenty-five feet in diameter, giving the Beluga its customary puffy look. Loading is done through the top of the expanded section. This section opens upwards, in contrast the Super Guppies, which pivot outwards on hinges like a door.

The Beluga’s transported one of its more unusual cargo items in 1999. A Beluga flew with Eugène Delacroix’s iconic painting Liberty Leading the People, a stylized depiction of the French Revolution. The painting itself was nearly ten feet tall and twelve feet wide, and could not fit inside other commercial airliners, so the Beluga stepped in and flew it from Paris to Tokyo.

In addition to one-of-a-kind pieces of art, the Beluga has transported components for the International Space Station, large pieces of industrial machinery, and even other planes and helicopters.

Although the cargo area is temperature-controlled, it is not pressurized. It therefore cannot carry certain types of cargo, such as live animals. It is also somewhat hindered by its payload capacity—only 47 tons.

Still, as Airbus’ first oversize cargo plane the Beluga provides a crucial function—and can be seen from miles away.

Competitors protest awards to SpaceX and L3Harris for hyperonic weapon tracking satellites - C4ISRNET,"Fri, 06 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jNGlzcm5ldC5jb20vYmF0dGxlZmllbGQtdGVjaC9zcGFjZS8yMDIwLzExLzA2L2NvbXBldGl0b3JzLXByb3Rlc3QtYXdhcmRzLXRvLXNwYWNleC1hbmQtbDNoYXJyaXMtZm9yLWh5cGVyb25pYy13ZWFwb24tdHJhY2tpbmctc2F0ZWxsaXRlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON - Raytheon and Airbus are protesting two recent awards for eight missile tracking satellites issued to SpaceX and L3Harris, putting into question the Space Development Agency’s tight schedule to get its initial constellation on orbit in 2022.

The news was first reported by Aviation Week.

Under the Oct. 5 award in question, SpaceX and L3Harris were issued contracts to design and develop four satellites equipped with wide field of view (WFOV) overhead persistent infrared (OPIR) sensors. The eight satellites would form tranche 0 of SDA’s tracking layer, which the military is building to track hypersonic weapons from space.

L3Harris received $193 million, while SpaceX received $149 million.

Airbus U.S. Space & Defense first filed its protest of the award Oct. 28, while Raytheon filed its own protest on Nov. 3. A stop work order has been issued for SpaceX and L3Harris.

“SDA is working with the GAO to achieve fast, accurate and equitable resolution to the protests received from Airbus and Raytheon on the agency’s Tracking Tranche 0 contracts,"" an SDA spokesperson said in a statement. “SDA is committed to full and open competition whenever practicable and the agency understands protests are a potential and not uncommon part of that process.”

The tracking layer is one of several capabilities being built into the agency’s planned mega-constellation known as the National Defense Space Architecture. SDA is using a spiral development approach to build out that constellation, by adding more satellites every two years. The first tranche, which would include the eight missile tracking satellites in question, will include about 30 satellites set to launch in 2022. By the end of 2026, the agency wants to have hundreds of satellites in orbit.

While Raytheon declined to comment, Airbus U.S. Space & Defense told C4ISRNET in a statement that concerns over the government’s evaluation process for the proposals led the company to protest the award.

“While determined highly competitive, Airbus U.S. Space & Defense, Inc. was ultimately not selected by SDA for award. Our post-award debrief review identified concerns about the government’s evaluation process, and as a result, we have filed a protest with the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO),” an Airbus U.S. spokesperson said in a statement. “Airbus U.S. believes its proposal based on the ARROW commodity satellite bus and the Airbus OneWeb Satellites' operational manufacturing facility in Florida fits SDA’s evaluation criteria for commercial commoditized buses manufactured at scale.”

At the time of the awards, SDA Director Derek Tournear told C4ISRNET the awards were the result of a full and open competition, with the selection based purely on technical merit. Tournear praised both SpaceX and L3Harris in that interview, emphasizing both companies' plans to meet the agency’s aggressive schedule.

“SpaceX had a very credible story along that line — a very compelling proposal. It was outstanding,” he said. “They are one of the ones that have been at the forefront of this commercialization and commodification route.”

In addition, “L3Harris had an extremely capable solution. They have a lot of experience flying affordable, rapid, small satellite buses for the department,” he said. “They had the plant and the line in place in order to produce these to hit our schedule.”

April 27th is a very important date, as this is the day the first flight of the Airbus A380 commenced in 2005. The aircraft completed a test flight after three years of production.

To date, this is the largest commercial jet in the sky, with record-breaking seating capacity, wingspan and height. However, one metric where the Boeing 747 is bigger is the length of the aircraft! The Airbus A380 measures at 72.72 meters, while the 747 is 76.3 meters long. Other than that, the Super Jumbo is bigger in every aspect.

And that competition between the A380 and the 747 has stayed throughout the history of both jets. Although the 747 saw daylight much sooner – Boeing revealed the Queen Of The Skies in 1959.

Testing the Airbus A380

Airbus developed the A380 to compete with the Boeing 747, as Boeing completely dominated the segment of ultra-high-capacity aircraft. In 2000, Airbus‘ board officially approved the A3XX program and re-named it to the A380. 6 airlines lined up for the new jet and Airbus immediately secured 50 orders.

Airbus finalized the design in 2001 and production began just a few months later, in 2002.

The production of the Super Jumbo is quite a complex one. Especially logistically, as parts had to be delivered from Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom via air, sea and land.

To test the aircraft, Airbus built 5 A380s. The first A380 model to roll out of Airbus‘ plant in Toulouse, registered F-WWOW, conquered the hearts of everyone as soon as it took to the sky.

Impressed by the ease of handling

The event, which many aviation journalists have attended, was widely covered around the world. Everyone was excited for the newest Airbus jet, as it was about to redefine the passenger experience on an aircraft.

The first Airbus A380 flight took off on April 27th, 2005 at 10:29 AM local time, with 6 people on board. The two co-captains, Claude Lelaie and Jacques Rosay flew the aircraft. Fernando Alonso (not the F1 racing driver, the Airbus engineer), Jacky Joyce, Manfred Birnfeld and Gérard Desbois were also present on board.

After 3 hours and 54 minutes, the aircraft landed back at Blagnac International Airport in Toulouse.

The Airbus A380 ticked off every box on the primary flight test objectives list. The pilots were also extremely happy with the A380’s performance.

Claude Lelaie said that “[…] we now really sense the potential of this magnificent machine. And even on the ground, as already felt during the initial ground tests, the A380 handles as easily as any other aircraft.”

While the other captain, Jacques Rosay, confirmed Claude’s comments: “Within the first minutes of the flight, we were impressed by the ease of handling of the aircraft […]”.

After rigorous and tough testing, many changes to the structure of the aircraft, the Airbus A380 made its commercial debut on October 25th, 2007. The launch customer of the type was Singapore Airlines (SIA1) (SINGY) , as the airline used the A380 on Flight SQ380 from Singapore to Sydney.

Legacy

The Airbus A380 brought unprecedented luxury to the aviation industry. The jet provided an opportunity for airlines to make an aircraft into a flying hotel, as Singapore Airlines(SIA1) (SINGY) did so, a spa or a cocktail lounge. Flying the A380 is truly a unique experience that no other aircraft offers.

In total, 15 airlines fly the Airbus A380. The newest airline to operate the aircraft is All Nippon Airways, which will launch their first flights with the Airbus A380 on the 24th of May, 2019.

And the biggest operator of the Airbus A380 is, of course, Emirates. The Middle Eastern airline operates 109 out of the 235 A380 jets that Airbus has delivered. Emirates has ordered 169 Airbus A380s altogether.

According to Airbus, the A380 flies to more than 60 destinations in various airports around the world.

Unfortunately, the A380’s fortune ended much sooner than Airbus expected. On 14th of February, 2019, Airbus announced they are canceling the Airbus A380. While the Super Jumbo has a lot of features that are unique to it, but it has its fair share of problems as well.

The high-profit margins, limited destination count and insanely high fuel consumption left the Airbus A380 to only operate on very specific routes.

The bittersweet Valentine‘s day marked the end of something special, that probably won‘t return anytime soon, as airlines are moving away from quad-engine aircraft like the A380. The production of the Super Jumbo will end in 2021.

Engine makers let Airbus down says Emirates chief - Airline Ratings,"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyYXRpbmdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2VuZ2luZS1tYWtlcnMtbGV0LWFpcmJ1cy1zYXlzLWVtaXJhdGVzLWNoaWVmL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Emirates chief Sir Tim Clark says Airbus super salesman John Leahy is correct in his claim that engine makers let Airbus down on the A380.

Last week former Airbus Chief Operating Officer Commercial Mr. Leahy, in a global first, told AirlineRatings.com European Editor Andreas Spaeth that engine makers had let Airbus down with engine technology on the A380.

Mr. Leahy said last week that the engine makers “were assuring us that the specific fuel consumption was that of new generation engines, and it would be ten years before there was the next leap to a substantial improvement. We launched in 2000, but three years later we got the 787 being launched with GENx engines and Rolls Royce matching that, having a ten to 12 percent better specific fuel consumption than the A380’s engines. Can you imagine the success of the A380 if it had 12 percent better fuel burn than it actually had?”

In an exclusive interview with AirlineRatings.com, Mr. Clark said “what the hell were the engine manufacturers doing? They were messing with derivative engines for the A380 – not new technology. I think they were overworked at the time and too busy to focus on something new.”

“John must really have suffered badly. It’s great to learn what really went on behind the scenes,” Mr. Clark said.

And the Emirates chief agreed with many of Mr. Leahy’s other claims on design problems, quality issues, and Airbus pricing that stymied the success of the A380.

Mr. Clark who visited the A380 production line many times agreed that he did get upset about the quality issues, which impacted reliability in the early days.

Last year Mr. Clark said that while the A380 has a dispatch reliability of 99.5 percent in the early days its was just 90 percent.

Mr. Leahy said that he could “remember more than a few very unpleasant meetings with Tim Clark. He would go through the roof. But even he stayed on and eventually bought many more airplanes.”

In fact, Mr. Clark has been the A380s greatest supporter and has blamed airlines for using the giant jet incorrectly.

In an interview in November last year with AirlineRatings.com European Editor Andreas Spaeth, Mr. Clark slammed Air France and Lufthansa for their fit-out of the A380. “The whole approach to the A380 at Air France and Lufthansa was ‘just more of the same.’ They lost the opportunity to really define it.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.595256507396698}",neutral,0.595256507396698,0
