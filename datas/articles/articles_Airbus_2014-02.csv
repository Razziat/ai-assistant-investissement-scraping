2013 – Boeing vs. Airbus…. Who Won? - Airline Reporter,"Thu, 06 Feb 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxNC8wMi8yMDEzLWJvZWluZy12cy1haXJidXMtd29uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"2013 is now well in our rear view mirrors as we speed along the runway of another year and it is time to look back. We have covered what we did during 2013 on AirlineReporter but what about looking at what our two favorite aircraft manufacturers did? 2013 were big years for both Boeing & Airbus on many levels, so let’s take a look at more detail of exactly what happened in the order & delivery world:

Orders:

In 2013, the big air shows in Paris & Dubai flooded the order books of both manufacturers. Airbus and Boeing both had record-breaking years with 1,619 & 1,531 gross orders, respectively. The winner in this situation is obviously Airbus by a good margin; the types of orders look consistent too:

Both Boeing & Airbus had very close years in the narrow body market. The Boeing 737 family netted 1,208 orders versus 1,253 for its Airbus rival. You could endlessly breakdown all that data but only Airbus provided an “official” accounting of CEO (Current Engine Option) vs NEO (New Engine Option) orders of 377 & 876, respectively (though from figures I managed to collate, the 737 MAX had approximately 700 orders,giving the unofficial narrow body win to Airbus).

The wide body order news was dominated towards the end of the year by official launch of the 777X-series at the Dubai Airshow, with a record for the most orders of a twin-aisle aircraft at launch. What a way to start the program off!

Boeing saw orders for the stretched 787-10 as well, with a number of 787 operators selecting the larger aircraft.

Deliveries:

Boeing & Airbus had record-setting delivery figures in 2013, with 648 and 626 respectively. Not a big margin between the two, but again it is the narrow body figures that dominate production levels. Airbus maintained an output of approximately 42 A320-family aircraft per month to deliver a total of 493 aircraft, while Boeing produced 440 737-family aircraft equating to approximately 37 per month (an astonishing level if you have ever been inside the Renton factory).

Looking at those figures, they look pretty similar, but it is the wide body figures where you see the real differences between the two manufacturers.

Boeing put out 208 wide body aircraft compared to Airbus’s 133, quite a major difference. Boeing’s figures can be further broken down by program, with the 777 dominating at 98 deliveries, followed closely by the 787 at 65. The 767 and 747 round out the delivery books with 21 & 24 respectively. Though Boeing’s win in this situation may look narrow overall, when you break down those figures there seems a very large gap in the wide body side of things.

2014 promises to be a great year for both manufacturers. With deliveries to begin from both the Airbus A350XWB & the Boeing 787-9, it is obvious where the attention is going to be. But we should also see further ramp up in production of the 737 and some of the first pieces for the 737 MAX to arrive.

It is hard to tell what will happen on the order front in 2014, with the airshows starting later in the year with Singapore and then Farnborough. Will the 777X order record continue now that the aircraft has a new home in Everett, and will the first delivery of the A350XWB spur additional orders? Only time will tell!

CNN —

To fully appreciate all the A350 XWB promises to offer, your imagination needs to take a rather giant leap.

On display for the first time at an airshow, the brand new extra wide bodied passenger jet has been one of the Singapore Airshow’s major attention grabbers.

Flying high above the Changi Exhibition Centre, it looks sleek and maneuverable.

It’s a big draw, part of the airshow’s static display sitting beside its key competitor, Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner.

But step on board, and it’s unlike any other experience on a passenger jet, because the A350 is still a test aircraft.

Packed with flight testing gear, including the equivalent of 400 kilometers of bright orange testing cables, every nuance of what happens when the plane is in the air is captured by equipment that feeds data live to Airbus’ headquarters in Toulouse.

Some 600,000 parameters can be monitored and recorded at any one time as part of that testing.

Large water tanks under the floor are filled to the exact weight the aircraft will carry when it’s full of passengers and baggage.

The A350 first took to the skies on June 14 last year. Soon after, it performed a fly-by at the Paris Airshow.

So far two test planes have clocked 1,000 hours of flying time, some in extreme conditions.

To date the A350 has experienced the cold of northern Canada and the high altitude of La Paz in Bolivia. In the next few weeks it will also conduct tests in the stifling heat of the Middle East.

All five test A350s will have to fly for 2,500 hours before achieving certification.

Selling features

This is a passenger jet made up of 53% composite material according to Simon Azar from the Airbus Marketing Division, the highest of any commercial aircraft.

This allows the A350 to travel as fuel efficiently as possible, lowering operating costs.

The wings of the jet incorporate the jet maker’s latest aerodynamics and advanced low-speed controls. The curled winglets are designed to reduce drag, again saving fuel.

Essentially the plane will fly further for less, to help offset the high cost of buying the aircraft, which has a list price of $254 million-322 million depending on size.

Also adding to the customer experience, Airbus says, are the A350’s low noise levels. This airplane has already been nicknamed by some as the “Hushliner,” a title Airbus has embraced.

“The noise levels for the aircraft are going to be very low,” says Azar. “It’s designed to be a very quiet aircraft both in the cabin and for surrounding space as the aircraft flies around. That’s very important. Noise pollution around airports is something that we work to reduce.”

Airbus also says its custom Rolls Royce engine is unrivaled in terms of fuel efficiency, and contributes to the aircraft achieving a 25% reduction in seat-mile costs and 25% lower carbon dioxide emissions.

Passenger experience

For passengers, Airbus says it’s offering great quality air (replaced on the aircraft every two to three minutes), wider cabins and 18-inch-wide seats in economy.

When carrying 315 passengers this plane can travel 7,800 nautical miles, or an equivalent 17 hours, useful when research suggests passengers of the future will be flying for longer.

The twin aisle jet can carry between 250 and 400 passengers.

It’s designed to have an economy class carrying nine abreast, but the A350 will come in three sizes, the A350-800, A350-900 and A350-1000, and can be configured to seat passengers from eight to 10 abreast.

It’ll be up to the customer airlines to choose the mode of inflight entertainment.

Business class passengers will experience all the perks, with Airbus promising mood lighting and the option for full flat seats. First class can be fitted at the customer airline’s discretion.

It’s a lot to get your head around when you look at the airplane as it is today.

“Flight crew class” is what Azar laughingly calls the 50 odd well-worn gray seats the jet is currently fitted with, all recovered from old aircraft. For now, these are strictly reserved for crew and mechanics during test flights, but that will change.

The first fit-out of an A350 with a proper cabin is expected next month.

VIPs and media only

The A350 arrived in Singapore shortly before the airshow started. Only a select few have been allowed inside, including aviation journalists and VIP visitors, including Britain’s Undersecretary of State for Transport Stephen Hammond.

On Thursday the plane is due to fly 13 hours back to Toulouse, where rigorous tests will continue until the plane is ready to go to market.

Airbus says it expects that to be in the fourth quarter of this year.

Its debut customer, Qatar Airways, has ordered 80 of the aircraft.

Airbus has a backlog of orders for 814 A350 jets, from 39 customers, almost a third of which are from the Asia Pacific region.

Airbus Defence and Space, number two worldwide in space technologies, has been awarded a 60-million-euro contract by the European Space Agency (ESA) to continue definition and feasibility studies in 2014 for the new Ariane 6 European launcher.

These studies will pinpoint the detailed architecture developed so far and consolidate the launcher’s main characteristics. The results of these studies will be revealed in November 2014 at ESA’s System Requirements Review (SRR).

Validation of the programme’s smooth progress should allow ESA to set the specifications of the Ariane 6 launch system, which will then enable member states to decide on continuation of the new launcher’s development at the next ESA Ministerial Council meeting, scheduled for December 2014.

Airbus Defence and Space will continue fine tuning the definition of the Ariane 6 launcher, while in parallel developing the Ariane 5 ME launcher and, in particular, developing many features common to both Ariane 5 ME and Ariane 6. The ESA contracts awarded to Astrium (now integrated into Airbus Defence and Space) in 2013 include developing the Ariane 5 ME with the aim of improving Ariane 5 performance by over 20% by 2018.

At the November 2012 Ministerial Council meeting, ESA decided to commence definition studies for the new Ariane 6 launcher and to continue with the development of Ariane 5 ME, while also seeking to maximise synergies between the two future launchers."

Officials at Washington Dulles International Airport say the body of a man was found in the wheel well of a South African Airways widebody jet over the weekend.

The Airbus A340 was in a remote parking area at the airport on Saturday when the body was discovered around 1:30 p.m. ET on Saturday by ground workers.

Officials from the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority tell The Associated Press that the circumstances surrounding the main's death are uncertain.

The incident raised speculation about a possible stowaway situation, but officials said it was unclear when or how the body got into the wheel well, Reuters adds.

Tlali Tlali, a spokesperson for South African Airways, tells NBC Washington that the A340 in question flew to Dulles as South African Airways Flight 207, landing there on Wednesday after taking off from Johannesburg and then making a scheduled stop in Dakar, Senegal. The aircraft had been at Dulles since that time.

""We regret any loss of human life and are deeply concerned about the suspicious circumstances surrounding this incident..,"" Tlali said in a statement.

Airbus, Boeing's chief rival in the aerospace industry, brought its new jet to the Singapore Air Show this week.

We've been seeing photos of the A350 XWB for months, and it did a special fly-over during the Paris Air Show in June.

But this is the first time the public had the chance to go near the thing.

The A350 XWB, in the works for nearly a decade, is an effort to push the envelope in passenger comfort, aerodynamics, and fuel efficiency.

One of the first commercial jets to be made primarily of composite materials instead of metal, the A350 will come in three variants, the 800, 900, and 1000. They will carry between 276 and 369 people.

The variants of Boeing's Dreamliner, another composite jet, seat between 242 and 323 passengers (though airlines can make special arrangements for more or fewer seats).

Boeing had the jump on Airbus, delivering the first Dreamliner in September 2011. But two battery malfunctions a week apart in January 2013 led to a federally mandated grounding, hurting the planemaker's reputation and bottom line.

Eager to avoid such a costly debacle, Airbus has been careful rolling out the A350. But it's now moving through the testing phase at a rapid clip — roughly twice the rate it used on its last new plane, according to Aviation Week."
Securaplane marks 10-year relationship with Airbus - Arizona Daily Star,"Sat, 15 Feb 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3R1Y3Nvbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvY29sdW1uL3NlY3VyYXBsYW5lLW1hcmtzLTEwLXllYXItcmVsYXRpb25zaGlwLXdpdGgtYWlyYnVzL2FydGljbGVfYTRmZDBmYmUtN2ExMC01MWIzLTg5NmYtY2E5ZDg0YzQ4NWY1Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The competitive battle between Boeing Co. and Airbus is often cast as a U.S.-versus-Europe struggle for airliner supremacy.

But although Airbus is decidedly a European company, a significant proportion of Airbus airliner parts are made in America — by companies including Oro Valley-based Meggitt Securaplane.

In fact, Securaplane has been providing Airbus with a key cockpit-door surveillance system for a decade — a relationship the two companies celebrated this week at Securaplane’s new flagship plant in Oro Valley.

“We’re 10 years into the marriage, and so far it’s been very positive,” David Williams, vice president of procurement for Airbus Americas, told a crowd of Securaplane employees in the cafeteria of the company’s new facility in Oro Valley’s Innovation Park.

Shubhayu Chakraborty, president of Securaplane since 2009, said the local company looks forward to working to supply Airbus with more innovative products.

Talks about future product-supply opportunities are ongoing, Williams and Chakraborty said.

Besides the surveillance systems Secureplane supplies to Airbus, the local company designs and makes battery, power conversion, camera, security and wireless control systems. Securaplane’s customers include most of the major aircraft makers, besides Airbus including Boeing Co., Bombardier, Gulfstream and Embraer.

Securaplane, part of United Kingdom-based Meggitt PLC since 2011, supplies a battery charging system for Boeing’s high-efficiency 787 Dreamliner, which was temporarily grounded last year after battery fires hit two of the planes. The local company’s products were not implicated in an inconclusive investigation of the fires. Though regulators have not yet issued a final report, Chakraborty says the company remains confident in its products.

Securaplane’s innovations have helped drive sales growth that has averaged about 15 percent annually since 2009, Chakraborty said, adding that the company’s workforce has roughly tripled since 2009 to 180 today.

“We expect double-digit (annual) growth through the next 10 years,” Chakraborty said, pegging the company’s current annual sales in the range of $75 million.

That growth drove the decision top expand to the new facility at 12350 N. Vistoso Park Road in Oro Valley, which at about 55,000 square feet is about twice the size of its old plant about two miles away.

Chakraborty praised Oro Valley officials for helping the company push the project through from groundbreaking in late March 2013 to initial move-in in December.

The Securaplane project was the first to be approved under Oro Valley’s new Economic Expansion Zone ordinance, which provides expedited permitting for qualified developments. Oro Valley Mayor Satish Hiremath noted.

The town permitting process allowed the project to move forward without a single construction delay, Chakraborty said.

“Is was a really expedited schedule — to give you an idea, if you came here in March of 2013, this ground would have looked like the mountains — it was bare desert,” he said, gesturing out a window to Pusch Ridge and the Santa Catalinas to the east.

About a third of Securaplane’s staff works in engineering, he said. Though the company recruits nationally, it has hired a number of University of Arizona engineering graduates and is looking to strengthen its ties with the UA, Chakraborty said. Securaplane has sponsored student engineering projects and has hosted student interns from both the UA’s College of Engineering and the Eller College of Management.

While it is sometimes hard to get recruits to move to the Tucson area — partly because Tucson competes with other areas with larger aerospace clusters — the Oro Valley location and the weather are a big selling point, Chakraborty said.

“That is definitely an attractive selling point and we do use that a lot in our recruiting — maybe that’s why our recruiting is more successful in the winter,” Chakraborty joked.

Securaplane may indeed beef up its staff, given current forecasts for huge growth in aviation as existing airlines look to modernize their fleets and new airlines expand in developing countries.

Industrywide, Airbus and other industry leaders forecast that the world will need 30,000 new airplanes in the next 20 years at a cost of more than $4 trillion, Williams said.

That means opportunity for U.S.-based aerospace tech companies.

About 80 percent of the parts for Airbus planes are sourced from subcontractors, and 42 percent of the money the French-based company spends on aircraft-related procurement come from U.S. firms, Williams said.

Dollarwise, Airbus’ annual U.S. spending is expected to grow from $13 billion in 2012 — including about $225 million to Arizona companies including Securaplane and Honeywell — to $20 billion by 2020.

Airbus relies heavily on U.S. companies like Securaplane for innovative technologies, such as the cockpit surveillance system the Oro Valley company provides for its airliners, Williams said. Williams congratulated Securaplane for having a 100 percent delivery record in 23 of the last 24 months, despite the expansion move.

“That is what we expect, but is more unusual than we hope,” he said.

Business for Airbus suppliers will only increase as Airbus moves through a nine-year backlog of plane orders, Williams said.

A new Airbus final-assembly plant scheduled to start production next year in Mobile, Ala., will bring production closer to U.S. customers and suppliers, he said.

“We’re searching for ways to improve our lead times, but we’re a victim of our success,” Williams said."

SINGAPORE — Airbus showed off its new wide-body A350 on Monday ahead of Asia's biggest air show, sending a signal the jet's delivery schedule is on track and stepping up its battle with Boeing for the lucrative long-haul market.

Reporters toured an A350 fitted with monitoring equipment instead of a passenger cabin. At the Singapore show, which starts Tuesday, it will go on public display for the first time since making its debut flight in June last year. It also will join the show's flying display.

A little more than half of the jet is made of carbon fiber to make it lighter and more fuel efficient, a key consideration for airlines contending with volatile fuel prices.

The A350, which can carry from 200 to 400 passengers and has a list price starting at $254.3 million, will allow Airbus to step up competition in the long-haul market dominated by Boeing's 777 and 787 jets.

Airbus has received 814 orders so far for the A350, with 30% coming from Asian airlines such as Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways and Singapore Airlines. The region is a crucial market for plane makers because its economic growth is driving rapid expansion of jet fleets.

Airbus hopes to woo buyers by showing off the plane to trade visitors on the show's first two days.

The airplane's appearance in Singapore is a strong sign it's on schedule to start deliveries to airline customers in the second half of the year.

Airbus engineers say they've been testing the airplane under extreme conditions and it's now entering the certification process.

This year they flew the plane to La Paz, Bolivia for high altitude testing, to Iqualit in northern Canada to check its performance in cold weather, and to a Florida facility to test it under even more extreme temperatures."

SINGAPORE CNN —

Of all the aircraft on display at the Singapore Airshow, the brand new, fuel-efficient Airbus A350 XWB is dominating attention.

Billed as the new generation wide-bodied jetliner and seen as a direct competitor to Boeing’s Dreamliner, the A350 has been drawing crowds, taking part in aerial displays and opening its doors to select trade visitors. It’s all part of a grand plan by Europe’s Airbus to try to woo as many buyers as possible.

Inside the 40,000 square meters of airshow exhibition space, the plane’s maker, Airbus, has also grabbed the limelight, announcing the first big deal of this biennial aerospace and defense trade show to a packed press conference on Tuesday – the firm sale of 63 A320 Family single aisle aircraft to low cost Vietnamese carrier VietJetAir.

Delivery is scheduled to start later this year. VietJetAir will also lease a further seven A320 aircraft and has purchase options for another 30. The $6.4 billion deal is a significant expansion for the privately-owned low-cost airline, which was only founded in 2011.

“The A320 has proven to be extremely efficient in service with VietJetAir and is a favorite with our passengers,” said VietJetAir’s Managing Director Luu Duc Khanh at a signing ceremony held this afternoon.

The center of world demand

VietJetAir is typical of the market here. It’s a low cost carrier, numbers of which are growing rapidly across Asia Pacific, fueling demand for single aisle planes.

Airbus predicts in the next 20 years the Asia-Pacific region will need almost 7,000 deliveries of single aisle aircraft, representing over a third of the world’s total.

“All our products are in the region in significant numbers, and we continue to dominate sales in this region because we have the aircraft Asia-Pacific airlines need,” says Airbus Chief Operating Officer Customers, John Leahy.

Arch rival Boeing is more circumspect about the prospect of being able to announce any big deals out of this airshow. But the Vice President of Marketing for Boeing Commercial Planes, Randy Tinseth, says the exhibition is just as much about bonding with customers.

“The Asia-Pacific market in terms of demand is about 35% of the world demand so it’s incredibly important and we’re delivering more airplanes than anyone else in the market here, so we do have strength, there’s no question,” Tinseth says.

The world’s two largest airplane manufacturers have spent many long hours poring over predictions for growth in Asia-Pacific and both have come up with mind boggling forecasts.

“The economy grows, incomes going up, and incomes going up means more people travel. And it’s really pretty staggering. If you think about the Asia-Pacific region, if you look out the next five to ten years, each year 100 million people will travel in terms of growth,” Tinseth says.

Airbus is predicting the region’s airlines will take delivery of some 10,940 new passenger and cargo aircraft between now and 2032.

The figure from Boeing differs slightly, with estimates 12,820 new aircraft will be needed in Asia-Pacific within the next two decades, a market Tinseth values at $1.9 trillion dollars.

“This is the world’s largest market for single aisle airplanes. It’s the largest market for wide body [twin aisle] airplanes, it’s the largest market for big airplanes like the 747, and it’s the biggest market for freighters so the center of aviation is here, that’s why we’re here.”

Tinseth says 36% of the world’s new airplane deliveries over the next 20 years will be in Asia and nearly half the world’s air traffic growth will be driven by travel to and from the region.

Battleground

As to who currently has the upper hand in Asia-Pacific, Airbus says in 2013 it won 80% of all new business in the region. But it’s a more level playing field in terms of actual deliveries, with Airbus delivering 331 aircraft into Asia Pacific last year, representing 51% of all new carriers entering service here.

Aviation analyst and vice president of ICF International David Stewart has been watching the competition between Airbus and Boeing for 15 years.

“I firmly believe that these things tend to balance themselves out and that one year Airbus will have a good year, and some years Boeing is well ahead. It’s all about timing in terms of where they are in their product cycles.”

Airbus says it’s already received 814 orders for its A350 XWB. Thirty percent of orders have come from Asian airlines including Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines.

Airbus claims its current Asia-Pacific order backlog is 1,740. Boeing says its order backlog in the region is around 1,000 planes.

On the single aisle side, Boeing’s main Asia-based customer is Indonesia’s Lion Air. The airplane maker has long dominated the wide body market, with customers including All Nippon Airways, Japan Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines and some Chinese airlines.

With Tuesday’s announcement, competition just stepped up a notch in this critical market and both Boeing and Airbus are keen to get as much leverage as possible out of this year’s Singapore Airshow."

Airbus Helicopters to make cockpit image recorders standard; gives X4 update - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 26 Feb 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzaGVsaWNvcHRlcnN0b21ha2Vjb2NrcGl0aW1hZ2VyZWNvcmRlcnNzdGFuZGFyZGdpdmVzeDR1L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters announced a plan to make cockpit image recording systems standard on its entire range of civil helicopters, provided updates on the development of the X4, and unveiled an extended range version of the EC225 —the EC225e — at Heli-Expo 2014 in Anaheim, Calif., yesterday.

Guillaume Faury, speaking at a press conference as he made his Heli-Expo debut as president of Airbus Helicopters, said that 2013 had been “a year of challenges” for the company, which led to a reassessment and development of a new set of priorities — and said chief among these was safety.

“We’ve been challenged in 2013 by accidents, and these accidents have increased my determination and the determination of our company to raise the bar in terms of safety together with our operators and customers,” said Faury. “Our requirements for safety must be absolute.”

He said the company had shared its experience, technologies and tools with sister company Airbus — and among the latter is the use of image and flight data recording.

“After each and every accident of an aircraft that is not equipped with such system, we come to the conclusion that we should have one,” said Faury. As a result of this, he said the company would be installing cockpit image recording systems as standard across its range of civil helicopters — extending the use of the system that has been standard on all new AS350s since January 2013. Faury said this process would be implemented over the course of the next 15 months, and would be complete by mid-2015.

“This is a major decision,” he said. “It will help us [during] incident or accident analysis of course . . . but it will help our customers to put in place and run their safety management systems. These are fantastic tools to review procedures.”

Aircraft developments





Faury also shared some updates on the much anticipated X4 — the five- to six-tonne twin engine successor to the Dauphin family of aircraft. He said the development represented an investment in innovation, and would provide increased payload with enhanced mission capability, as well as a reduction in operating costs and increased fuel efficiency. Its innovative blades, which contribute to the aircraft’s fuel efficiency and quieter operation, have now notched up 155 flight hours, while its brand new main gearbox has also begun runs. Faury said the aircraft’s full-composite structure would be delivered this summer, and that the program was on track for a first prototype to be powered on by year end, with a first flight following in 2015.

With regards to another ongoing development, the EC145 T2 is scheduled to receive certification in the second quarter of 2014, with deliveries to begin in the second half of the year.

Faury said the EC175, which recently received certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), will be certified by the Federal Aviation Administration in the course of the next few months, with the three launch customers — Noordzee Helikopters Vlaanderen, Heli-Union and Utair — receiving the first deliveries of the aircraft later this year.

The company hopes the EC175 will have a large role in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico going forward, and Marc Paganini, president of Airbus Helicopters, Inc. (formerly American Eurocopter), said the company would be investing in the region to ensure it had the necessary support in place for the aircraft’s operation there. “We will invest in a second full flight simulator, based in the U.S., to train the American pilots here, close to where their operations are,” he said. “[But] it’s not only investing in the flight simulator, it’s overall a very strong commitment to our presence in the Gulf of Mexico, and a major emphasis on the customer support.”

Targeting the oil-and-gas operations that are going further offshore to ultra-deepwater rigs, the EC225e, slated for certification in late 2015, will have an additional fuel tank to enable very long range flights. It will also have an increased payload lift, a new cabin layout for increased comfort, and upgraded new generation avionics for enhanced situational awareness and reduced workload.

The EC225’s offshore fleet was temporarily grounded following two high-profile ditchings in the North Sea in 2012, but Faury said the entire worldwide fleet was now available for operation, with 60,000 flight hours logged around the globe since its return to service. The root cause of the ditchings was a crack in the lower vertical shaft of the main gear box bevel gear, and Faury said the long-term fix — a redesigned shaft — was proceeding according to plan. “The new shaft is under certification, we have started the industrialization, and we will start the retrofit later this year — around summer,” he said. “The EC225 is not only back in the air, it’s back in the race.”

In other sectors, Paganini said the company has been looking at the low cost medium market for utility operators. “We believe it’s a very promising market,” he said. “The challenge is to help our customer to convince the end customer to invest in a safer and higher performing aircraft, and this is what we are doing. . . . We are looking at the [EC]145 which would be what we call the low-cost, low-weight aircraft — [with a] very simple interior and no autopilot, for example.”"

Then he walks down two flights of stairs and out onto the tarmac of Toulouse-Blagnac Airport in southern France. There, rising above a fleet of newly painted A320 short-haul jets, is an Airbus A350-XWB long-range widebody airliner—the very first of its kind. Sleek and nearly all white except for the lettering along its flank and the swirling blue-on-blue Airbus logo on the tail, it carries the official designation MSN001. Last May, in a modest employees-only ceremony, the final assembly line workers formally handed the plane over to the Flight Test Department. Or, as du Ché sees it, “They handed it to me.”

As a flight engineer and head of the department, du Ché gets first pick of the test flights. Although he describes himself as risk-averse, he tends to choose those he calls the most “interesting,” which means at the edge of the plane’s capabilities, where if something goes wrong, it could destroy the plane. Since June, du Ché and his colleagues have flown at the A350’s maximum design speed; conducted aerodynamic stalls; and taken off so slowly that the tail dragged on the ground."

“Under our new name, Airbus Helicopters, we have redefined our priorities. We are committed to new standards with respect to customer satisfaction, quality and safety, and competitiveness,” said Airbus Helicopters President Guillaume Faury. “We’re implementing these priorities by placing our efforts on product reliability and availability, the reduction of lead times and production costs, and integrating the Airbus Group’s standards of quality – all while setting new standards in the helicopter industry in the key domain of aviation safety.”

To be announced at the exposition’s Anaheim Convention Center venue is Airbus Helicopter’s upgraded version of its proven EC225 Super Puma: the EC225e. This new variant responds to operators’ requirements for extended-range missions – particularly in support of deep-water oil and gas airlift duties.

Airbus Helicopters’ next-generation EC175, which received European certification in January, will be represented at Heli-Expo with the display of a high-fidelity full-scale mockup in the corporate configuration. To support the EC175’s service entry, dedicated resources will be available to customers, including spare parts inventories and on-site technical assistance.

By the time EC175 deliveries begin later this year, the initial pilots will have received training on a flight navigation procedure training (FNPT) and Level D full-flight simulator – both located in Marignane and operational in spring and summer 2014, respectively. As the fleet expands, other EC175 full-flight simulators will be deployed in close proximity to regions where customers are introducing the aircraft into service.

Also exhibited at Heli-Expo is the new EC145 T2, to be certified and delivered in 2014. This latest evolution of the EC145 is equipped for the first time with Airbus Helicopters’ signature Fenestron shrouded tail rotor, as well as upgraded main and tail rotor gear boxes. Operators of the EC145 T2 will have access to a service portfolio that includes training and operations, system and software maintenance, and turnkey solutions. An EC145 T2 full-flight simulator will be deployed at Donäuworth, Germany in 2015.

Another emphasis of Airbus Helicopters’ Heli-Expo 2014 presence will be the company’s comprehensive support and services portfolio, which is tailored to meet operators’ unique requirements. On display will be exhibits dedicated to support for new aircraft and the Helionix avionics system (now incorporated in the EC175 and EC145 T2), training and operations, helicopter upgrades, and e-services such as the Keycopter® customer portal.

Airbus Helicopters’ Heli-Expo 2014 exhibit stand will be located in Hall A, Booth 523 in the Anaheim Convention Center during the February 25-27 event."
Airbus Shows Off Special Qatar Airways’ Livery on Fourth A350 - Airline Reporter,"Tue, 11 Feb 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxNC8wMi9haXJidXMtc2hvd3Mtc3BlY2lhbC1xYXRhci1haXJ3YXlzLWxpdmVyeS1mb3VydGgtYTM1MC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In Toulouse, France this past week, Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker made a visit to inspect the Airbus A350XWB manufacturing line ahead of the first delivery of the type to the airline later this year. As Al Baker inspected the A350 line, along with senior Qatar & Airbus management, Airbus revealed a special livery for their latest aircraft (MSN004).

MSN004 was painted in a hybrid Airbus & Qatar Airlines launch customer livery. Part Qatar Airways at the front, and the standard Airbus livery in the rear, the most noticeable features are the striking Oryx logos, not only on the aircraft body but also on the unique A350 winglets.

The aircraft will soon join the Airbus test fleet, where it will will be used for external noise and lightning tests, avionics development & certification, and training for the first customer pilots & maintenance teams.

Not only is Qatar Airways the launch customer of the A350; it is also the largest customer for the aircraft with over 80 on order. Akbar Al Baker said, ’œIt is a historic moment to see this fantastic aeroplane here in Toulouse and to witness all of the hard work that the team at Airbus has contributed into making this one of the finest aircraft in the world. Qatar Airways is proud to be the launch customer for this new aircraft, and we look forward to soon taking delivery of the first of 80 A350s.’

But that visit was not the only A350 news for Qatar. With the Singapore Airshow due to begin soon, and Airbus deciding to send one of their A350’s to the show, they decided to make a quick stop along the way. MSN003 made a stop at Doha’s new Hamad International Airport (HIA) on its way to Singapore, making it the first A350 to touch down in Qatar.

While on display on the tarmac at HIA, the A350 was swarmed by dignitaries and guests, along with senior Qatar Airways staff. Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker, never one to shy away from a chance to comment, said, ’œIt was certainly a proud and symbolic occasion for Qatar Airways and our team of air traffic and ground control crew at HIA to experience landing the new A350 at our new airport, as it gave us a unique glimpse into the exciting developments around the corner.’

As the A350 continued on to Singapore for the Airshow and left Qatar in its wake, we look towards the future again. With the first delivery to Qatar Airways later this year, maybe we’ll see the battle between Airbus & Boeing start a new chapter, this time in the mid-size aircraft range.

KRAILLING, Germany & NOVI, Mich.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--EOS, technology and market-leader for design-driven, integrated e-manufacturing solutions in the Additive Manufacturing (AM) sector, has collaborated with Airbus Group Innovations (previously EADS Innovation Works), of Filton, Bristol, to complete an environmental lifecycle comparison of two key production technologies, rapid investment casting and Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS™).

The Airbus Group Innovations-EOS eco-assessment, applied to an Airbus A320 nacelle hinge bracket (a highly standardized part), strove to include detailed aspects of the overall lifecycle: from the supplier of the raw powder metal, to the equipment manufacturer (EOS), and to the end-user (Airbus Group Innovations). Adapted from Airbus’ streamlined lifecycle assessment (SLCA) and ISO 14040 series requirements data, the testing will serve as the basis for continued “Cradle-to-Cradle” study into other aerospace parts, processes and end-of-life strategies.

“We have worked in a bold, new collaboration with Airbus Group Innovations on integrating business and ecological sustainability from sourcing through to product development,” said Nicola Knoch, environmental and sustainability consultant to EOS. “There is now a valuable, holistic baseline established on our technology regarding the measurable costs, benefits and impacts of DMLS. This sets the groundwork for future technology developments in Additive Manufacturing and further studies.”

As a first step, the SLCA was conducted on a generic bracket benchmarking the DMLS process with a conventional casting process used as the baseline. Comparing the lifecycle of a steel bracket (casting process) with the lifecycle of a design-optimized titanium bracket (DMLS):

The use phase has by far the biggest impact in terms of energy consumption and CO 2 emissions over the whole lifecycle of the bracket.

emissions over the whole lifecycle of the bracket. CO 2 emissions over the whole lifecycle of the nacelle hinges were reduced by nearly 40 percent via weight saving that resulted from an optimized geometry, which is enabled by the design freedom offered by the DMLS process and the use of titanium.

emissions over the whole lifecycle of the nacelle hinges were reduced by nearly 40 percent via weight saving that resulted from an optimized geometry, which is enabled by the design freedom offered by the DMLS process and the use of titanium. Most significantly, using DMLS to build the hinge may reduce the weight per plane by 10 kilograms, a noteworthy saving when looking at industry “buy-to-fly” ratios.

The second phase of the analysis focused on the manufacturing process for the design-optimized bracket using titanium as an ideal, common material—and, this time, benchmarking the manufacturing process of investment casting against that of DMLS via the EOSINT M 280 system:

The total energy consumption for creating the initial raw powder metal, then producing the bracket in DMLS, was slightly smaller than the equivalent cast process steps (with the higher energy use of DMLS limited to the melt and chill cycle of its manufacturing profile and offset at the same time by a significantly reduced build time). Casting in this comparison was burdened with the furnace operation of burning an SLA (stereolithography) epoxy model, which uses considerable energy and generates greenhouse gases.

The DMLS process itself used only the material actually needed to make the part—thereby eliminating waste from secondary machining and reducing consumption of titanium by 25 percent over the cast application.

“DMLS has demonstrated a number of benefits, as it can support the optimization of design and enable subsequent manufacture in low-volume production,” said Jon Meyer, Additive Layer Manufacturing Research Team Leader, in his final report. “In general, the joint study revealed that DMLS has the potential to build light, sustainable parts with due regard for the company’s CO 2 footprint.”

Airbus Helicopters provides new update on EC135 fuel system checks - Vertical Magazine,"Fri, 21 Feb 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1c2hlbGljb3B0ZXJzcHJvdmlkZXNuZXd1cGRhdGVvbmVjMTM1ZnVlbHN5c3RlbWNoZWNrcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters has released an update on its checks of the fuel sensors in the worldwide EC135 fleet.

On Feb. 20, Airbus Helicopters stated that it had received reports or a total of 1,506 sensors on 753 aircraft. This represents 70 percent of the global EC135 fleet, which encompasses 1,050 helicopters and 2,100 sensors.

In total, 99 fuel probes registered outside the tolerance level specified in an Alert Service Bulletin issued on Dec. 19. Of these, 62 showed deviations of less than three kilograms, which equals less than one minute of flight time. Although a cleaning and drying process restored the proper functioning of all fuel probes, five sensors did not recover the required specification and had to be replaced.

According to Airbus Helicopters, reliability analysis of the main tank fuel sensors conducted in parallel shows that there is no issue with the main tank probes, nor with the fuel transfer system and associated indications. Also, on all tested helicopters, the independent red “LOW FUEL” warning operated as expected on both supply tanks.

The Alert Service Bulletin was prompted by the discovery of supply-tank fuel gauging errors in EC135 helicopters flown by Bond Air Services and two other operators in Europe. According to the bulletin, tests have confirmed that the EC135’s fuel content probes generate erroneously high signals if contamination with water occurs."
Who’s bringing an Airbus A380 to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport? - The Dallas Morning News,"Wed, 26 Feb 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9haXJsaW5lcy8yMDE0LzAyLzI2L3dob3MtYnJpbmdpbmctYW4tYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtdG8tZGFsbGFzLWZvcnQtd29ydGgtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1haXJwb3J0L9IBjwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9haXJsaW5lcy8yMDE0LzAyLzI2L3dob3MtYnJpbmdpbmctYW4tYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtdG8tZGFsbGFzLWZvcnQtd29ydGgtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1haXJwb3J0Lz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport board will be asked next week to approve construction at the airport’s Terminal D to accommodate an Airbus A380, the airline industry’s largest passenger airplane.

The A380 supposedly will arrive in October. But the airport doesn’t say which airline plans to bring the A380.

-- This action will provide for construction at Terminal D to accommodate ADG VI aircraft by the anticipated required date of October 1, 2014.

-- Without the construction of the Terminal D jetbridge modifications, DFW Airport can not accommodate scheduled service of passenger-carrying ADG VI aircraft.

The airport staff is asking the board to approve a $2,847,777 construction contract to modify gates D15 and D16 with such changes as a second jet bridge and walkway to load passengers.

An airline spokesman politely declined to say who's coming. It'll be up to the airline to announce.

ADG VI, or Airplane Design Group VI, refers to the largest class of passenger airlines, a very exclusive club. It includes the A380 and the Boeing 747-8, although the 747-400 is in Group V.

We have several possibilities for international carriers that operate at Dallas/Fort Worth Airport and fly A380s.

Advertisement

-- Qantas Airways, which currently operates a Boeing 747-400 to Brisbane (and from Sydney)

-- Lufthansa, which currently operates an Airbus A330-300 to Frankfurt. It upsizes to an A340-300 in the spring.

-- Emirates Airline, which operates at Boeing 777-200 to Dubai.

Advertisement

-- British Airways, which currently operates a Boeing 747-400 to London Heathrow.

-- Korean Air, which currently operates a Boeing 777-200 to Seoul.

Not currently operating, but with plans, we have these future A380 operators:

-- Qatar Airways, which begins service in early July to Doha, Qatar. Qatar, which gets its first A380s in June, says it will use a Boeing 777-200LR.

Advertisement

-- Etihad Airways, which begins service in early December to Abu Dhabi. Etihad, which gets its first A380s in late 2014, says it will use a Boeing 777-200LR.

Of all these possibilities, we’d put British Airways and Qantas Airways at the top of the list, for two reasons.

One, they already operate the biggest passenger aircraft to D/FW Airport. Two, they’re Oneworld partners with American Airlines, which can feed their flights with lots of passengers.

We wouldn't put American on the list because it has no Airbus A380s in the fleet or on order. Its largest airplane is the Boeing 777-300ER.

Additive manufacturing pioneer EOS has joined forces with Airbus Group Innovations to put together a study on industrial 3D printing in aerospace.

The market leader for design-driven, integrated e-manufacturing solutions in additive manufacturing and Airbus Group Innovations (previous EADS Innovation Works), which is based in Bristol, are aiming to complete an environmental lifecycle comparison of both rapid investment casting and Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS), two key production technologies.

Airbus Group Innovations and EOS' eco-assessment was applied to a standardised Airbus A320 nacelle hinge bracket and strove to include a detailed analysis of the overall lifecycle of the part from the supplier of the raw powder metal, to the equipment manufacturer and to the end-user. The manufacturer was EOS and the end-user was Airbus Group Innovations.

Adapted from Airbus' streamlined lifecycle assessment (SLCA) and ISO 14040 series requirements data, the testing serves as the basis for continued ""Cradle-to-Cradle"" study into other aerospace parts, processes and end-of-life strategies.

To begin with, the SLCA was conducted on a generic bracket benchmarking the DMLS process with a conventional casting process used as the baseline. Comparing the lifecycle of a steel bracket (casting process) with the lifecycle of a design-optimised titanium bracket (DMLS):

The use phase has by far the biggest impact in terms of energy consumption and CO2 emissions over the whole lifecycle of the bracket.

CO2 emissions over the whole lifecycle of the nacelle hinges were reduced by nearly 40 per cent via weight saving that resulted from an optimised geometry, which is enabled by the design freedom offered by the DMLS process and the use of titanium.

Most significantly, using DMLS to build the hinge may reduce the weight per plane by 10 kilograms, a noteworthy saving when looking at industry ""buy-to-fly"" ratios.

The second phase of the analysis focused on the manufacturing process for the design-optimised bracket using titanium as an ideal, common material - and this time benchmarking the manufacturing process of investment casting against that of DMLS via the EOSINT M 280 system:

The total energy consumption for creating the initial raw powder metal, then producing the bracket in DMLS, was slightly smaller than the equivalent cast process steps (with the higher energy use of DMLS limited to the melt and chill cycle of its manufacturing profile and offset at the same time by a significantly reduced build time). Casting in this comparison was burdened with the furnace operation of burning an SLA (stereolithography) epoxy model, which uses considerable energy and generates greenhouse gases.

The DMLS process itself used only the material actually needed to make the part—thereby eliminating waste from secondary machining and reducing consumption of titanium by 25 per cent over the cast application.

In his final report, Additive Layer Manufacturing Research Team Leader Jon Meyer said: ""DMLS has demonstrated a number of benefits, as it can support the optimisation of design and enable subsequent manufacture in low-volume production. In general, the joint study revealed that DMLS has the potential to build light, sustainable parts with due regard for the company's CO 2 footprint.""

Nicola Knoch, Environmental and Sustainability consultant to EOS, commented: ""We have worked in a bold, new collaboration with Airbus Group Innovations on integrating business and ecological sustainability from sourcing through to product development.

""There is now a valuable, holistic baseline established on our technology regarding the measurable costs, benefits and impacts of DMLS. This sets the groundwork for future technology developments in additive manufacturing and further studies."""

A step towards Air Traffic Management (ATM) modernization in Asia-Pacific

Approximately 2,700 freighters will be required over the next 20 years, and around half of these will be in the mid-sized freighter segment, including 900 conversions.

Airbus ProSky has announced its decision to set up a new office in Singapore from April 2014.This announcement comes a year after the Research Collaboration Agreement (RCA) between the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) and Airbus ProSky to jointly develop a Concept of Operations for Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM)* based on Collaborative Decision Making (CDM)**.“Asia-Pacific is the world's fastest growing region for air travel. Opening a new office in Singapore is the next logical step towards fulfilling the commitment jointly started with CAAS and other Air Navigation Services Providers for the modernization of Air Traffic Management in the region“, said Paul-Franck Bijou, Airbus ProSky CEO.Airbus ProSky has been involved in many projects in Asia-Pacific focused on enhancing Air Traffic capacity, increasing flight efficiency and improving access to airports. In Australia for example, following the deployment of ATFM and CDM with Airservices in 2012, results have shown a reduction of five minutes in flight time on the 5th busiest world city pair Melbourne-Sydney, in combination with reduced airborne holding leading to a consequent fuel burn reduction.On a worldwide scale, it is expected that modernising ATM systems will generate significant environmental benefits such as saving some 13 billion litres of fuel per year, a reducing some 29 million tonnes of CO2 emissions per year as well as some four million hours of delays."

German-Korean Industrial Team To Build Kompsat-6 Radar Imager - SpaceNews,"Wed, 26 Feb 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS8zOTYyNWdlcm1hbi1rb3JlYW4taW5kdXN0cmlhbC10ZWFtLXRvLWJ1aWxkLWtvbXBzYXQtNi1yYWRhci1pbWFnZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — The high-resolution imaging radar for South Korea’s Kompsat-6 Earth observation satellite will be built by LIG Nex1 Co. Ltd. of Korea and Airbus Defence and Space’s German arm under a contract announced Feb. 26.

The contract follows the August 2013 launch of the Kompsat-5 radar Earth observation satellite, whose imaging sensor was provided by Airbus rival Thales Alenia Space of Italy. Germany and Italy both have national radar reconnaissance programs that have allowed their industry to compete against Canada’s MDA Corp., among others, for export business.

Seoul-based LIG Nex1 Co., a division of LG Group and a major Korean defense contractor, will use the Kompsat-6 work “to enter into a long-term cooperation with Airbus Defence and Space in the domain of spaceborne radar,” LIG Nex1 Chief Executive Lee Hyo-koo said in a statement announcing the contract. “LIG Nex1 is proud to have won the [Kompsat-6] sensor contract together with our subcontractor Airbus Defence and Space.”

South Korea has one of the world’s most dynamic national space programs. It is developing optical and radar Earth observation capabilities as well as meteorological satellite expertise. Airbus Defence and Space in 2013 won a contract to provide an ocean-color imager for Korea’s GEO-Kompsat 2B geostationary-orbiting satellite, scheduled for launch in 2019.

Airbus said Kompsat-6’s radar imager would be able to distinguish objects that are less than 1 meter in diameter in its SpotLight mode. Korean authorities in the past have said they plan to launch the satellite in 2019 as a replacement and successor to Kompsat-5.

Michael Menking, head of Airbus Space Systems’ Earth Observation, Navigation and Science division, said the win in Korea came “in the face of stiff competition. This will pave the way for further export successes in the fields of radar instruments and radar satellites.”

Airbus and Thales Alenia Space are both bidding to build radar reconnaissance satellite sensors for the Russian government.

Airbus Group unveils 7500-square-foot component repair facility for military aircraft unit at Mobile Regional Airport ... - AL.com,"Tue, 11 Feb 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsLmNvbS9saXZlLzIwMTQvMDIvYWlyYnVzX2dyb3VwX3VudmVpbHNfNzUwMC1zcXVhLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MOBILE, Alabama – Airbus Group's North American military aircraft unit unveiled Tuesday a new 7,500-square-foot component repair facility at Mobile Regional Airport.

The new addition complements the unit’s existing 30,000-square-foot, 45-employee maintenance, repair and overhaul delivery center, which has had a presence in the Port City for 10 years.

The addition of the new component repair facility is expected to improve customer service for the company’s medium and light multi-mission aircraft operators. New services include hydraulic, avionics, composite and structural repairs, painting, component exchange and highly skilled engineering support.

“Airbus Group’s North American military aircraft business has continually increased its capabilities to improve the maintenance of the U.S. fleet with spare parts support, state of the art maintenance, and engineering and technical support services,” said Sean O’Keefe, chairman and chief executive officer of Airbus Group Inc., in a prepared statement.

“This new facility will further reduce turnaround time, increase price competitiveness and enhance customer satisfaction,” O’Keefe said.

The Mobile Regional site was selected originally to house Airbus Group’s North American military aircraft operations, relocated to be closer to the U.S. Coast Guard, its largest customer in the nation. Specifically, it provides provides American operators of the C212 and CN235 tactical transports with the capabilities of a certified Federal Aviation Administration and European Aviation Safety Agency repair station as well as direct support from the aircraft manufacturer.

The facility was last expanded in 2009, to become Airbus Group’s military aircraft MRO delivery center for the United States.

U.S. Rep. Bradley Byrne, R-Fairhope, called the occasion another great example of why “it’s an exciting time to be in Southwest Alabama.”

""I welcome Airbus Group's continued investment in Mobile, and as a Member of the House Armed Services Committee I am excited to see this facility in our community supporting our Coast Guard assets. I look forward to working with Airbus to continue this mutually beneficial relationship,"" Byrne said.

Meanwhile, Mobile Mayor Sandy Stimpson called the facility a “tremendous asset” for both the local community and the U.S. military customers it serves.

“The expansion demonstrates Airbus’ confidence in Mobile and in their local workforce. We welcome this investment as another indication of the outstanding partnership between Airbus and the city of Mobile,” Stimpson said.

An Airbus Group spokesman confirmed late Tuesday the expansion in not expected to impact employment, but declined to provide the cost of the project.

For the unacquainted, Airbus Group's North American military aircraft unit was actually founded in Virginia in 1984, but was relocated to Mobile in 2005. Since that time, the Airbus Engineering Center was constructed at Mobile Aeroplex in 2007; the military aircraft MRO facility was renovated and expanded in 2009 at Mobile Regional; and ground was broken in early 2013 on the $600 million A320 final assembly line, currently under construction at Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley.

The aerospace giant has indicated that some capabilities at the new repair facility unveiled Tuesday could eventually be leveraged to support the final assembly line after it comes online in 2015.

Airbus is currently building its first A320 assembly line on U.S. soil at Mobile Aeroplex, expected to figure prominently in the company's ability to efficiently fill the mounting backlog for the popular single-aisle aircraft. The $600 million facility is slated to come online in 2015, deliver its first Mobile-assembled aircraft the following year and employ about 1,000 people when it reaches full annual production of 40 to 50 aircraft by 2018.

The company announced early Tuesday it is seeking aircraft structure/installation mechanics, installers for aircraft cabin furnishings and aircraft electricians.

Interested candidates can view the postings online and apply for the mandatory pre-employment training program to be administered through the Alabama Industrial Development Training program.

Jennifer Ogle , human resources director for Airbus' Mobile facility, spoke with AL.com to clarify some of the intricacies surrounding these long-anticipated employment opportunities.

Q: How many hires is Airbus seeking in this first wave?

Ogle: We will be filling more than 20 positions, and it will be the first of several hiring waves for these types of positions on the assembly line in 2014, and that hiring will continue into 2015.

Q: What is the timeline for training?

Ogle: These employees will start in Mobile and train for two months before being deployed to Hamburg, Germany, where they will spend up to six months receiving on-the-job training before returning to Mobile. By the time they return, we'll be preparing the assembly line for startup, and they will play a role in that as well.

Q: The job postings clearly state a two-week pre-employment training process is required through Airbus' hiring partner, the Alabama Industrial Development Training program. Candidates who complete the pre-employment training successfully will then be considered for employment by Airbus. Will any accommodations be made for job candidates outside the Mobile area who are unable to attend this preliminary training?

Ogle: Pre-employment training is a requirement for these positions. For those who are qualified and apply from areas outside the radius of the Mobile region, we will evaluate how to accommodate or if we can accommodate those individuals. AIDT has dealt with this in the past and has methods of addressing these issues.

Q: What other positions can potential Airbus employees expect to see posted in the near future?

Ogle: We will be searching for additional quality positions. There is a specific supplier quality position listed now, and other similar positions will be posted soon. We also expect to see some additional engineering positions posted in the future and – again – additional assembly line positions as well.

Q: How would you characterize Airbus' relationship with hiring partner AIDT nearly one year after ground was broken for this first final assembly line on U.S. soil?

Ogle: We continue to be very pleased with our partnership with AIDT, the progress of the training center and the support they've given on recruitment. We can't say often enough how much we rely on AIDT. It's an example of a terrific partnership."

The initial study from a partnership between Airbus and 3D printer maker EOS found significant lifecycle cost and sustainability advantages in using 3D printing over casting in aerospace production. The first project compared rapid investment casting and direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) on a standardized part.

As a starting point the Airbus/EOS team did an eco-assessment on the manufacturing of an Airbus A320 nacelle hinge bracket, a highly standardized part. The study examined lifecycle aspects of production from the supplier of the raw powder metal, to the equipment manufacturer (EOS), and to the end-user (Airbus Group Innovations). The study was adapted from Airbus’ streamlined lifecycle assessment (SLCA) and ISO 14040 series requirements data.

The current research will become the foundation for continued “cradle-to-cradle” assessments of other aerospace parts, processes and end-of-life strategies.

“There is now a valuable, holistic baseline established on our technology regarding the measurable costs, benefits and impacts of DMLS,” says Nicola Knoch, environmental and sustainability consultant to EOS. “This sets the groundwork for future technology developments in additive manufacturing and further studies.”

As a first step, the SLCA was conducted on a generic bracket benchmarking the DMLS process with a conventional casting process used as the baseline. Comparing the lifecycle of a steel bracket (casting process) with the lifecycle of a design-optimized titanium bracket (DMLS):

Qatar Airways is launching a new flight between its hub in Doha and London's Heathrow Airport, and there's no curtain dividing the haves from the have-nots.

The entire Airbus A319 jet is dedicated to business class, with just 40 seats.

Each seat, in rows of four, will fully recline and offer a big-screen entertainment system with more than 900 movies, TV shows, and video games to choose from.

The airline already operates five daily flights between the cities, this service will bring its weekly frequency from 35 to 42 flights. The A319 already in use by Qatar seats 102 economy and 8 first class passengers, according to SeatGuru.com.

Qatar Airways is young but growing fast, covering 134 destinations with 129 planes, and with nearly 300 more on order. In a press release, it said its ""aggressive expansion programme"" including new routes to Philadelphia, Istanbul, Edinburgh, Miami, and Dallas/Fort Worth.

All-business class planes are not unheard of. British Airways offers service between New York and London with just 32 seats onboard. Until it cancelled the service in November 2013, Singapore Airlines operated the world's longest flight, from Newark to Singapore, on an all-business Airbus A340.

Here's a look at the interior of the all-business class A319 that will run between Qatar and London:

Airbus has extended the validity of its bid beyond the end of the current financial year in April, he says, adding: “it really doesn’t matter whether it’s within the next month, or the next six months.” But it was a firm ‘no comment’ when it came to commenting on the status of Singapore’s Boeing KC-135 replacement need.

Meanwhile, Scherer responded to an Alenia Aermacchi official’s comments from earlier in the day about the C-27J’s claimed superior performance over the Airbus C295 medium transport. Pointing to the more than 160 C212, CN235 and C295 aircraft in operation throughout Asia – versus a current zero for the Spartan – he says: “The market has spoken, overwhelmingly.”

So, is this a new war of words? No, says Scherer: just an “emotional outburst by a frustrated competitor”.

With an eye on additional regional sales opportunities for the C295, Airbus also reveals that the Portuguese air force example which visited the show will fly on to New Zealand, where it will be used to perform a maritime patrol demonstration for the nation's military.

"What Makes a Heavy, Heavy? - Airline Reporter","Mon, 24 Feb 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxNC8wMi93aGF0LW1ha2VzLWEtaGVhdnktaGVhdnkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A while back, I viewed a tweet about an Air Traffic Control (ATC) conversation in New York, where JFK ATC got a little bit confused about an aircraft type. American Airlines (AA) Flight 32 was incorrectly called a ’œheavy’ aircraft, likely because for so long that flight was operated by a Boeing 767-200. Ever since AA debuted their new Airbus A321 on the LAX-JFK route, this flight no longer needs to use the “heavy” designation, but that didn’t stop the ATC staff from using old habits. It made me question, at what point does an aircraft become ’œheavy’?

When aircraft are approaching or departing an airport, they must use special designations to help avoid the wake turbulence from other aircraft. Larger aircraft, like a 767 or an A340, need more space behind them to prevent the wake vortices generated by the larger wing span from impacting other aircraft. The bigger the aircraft, the longer the distance.

The dangers are real, as all over the world a number of incidents have occurred that can be attributed to a wake vortex. From the crash of an XB-70 in the 60’s to some involving more modern aircraft in the last 10 years (including an A380 in Sydney).

Wake turbulence from an aircraft is caused by a number of factors; the two biggest are jet-wash and the wingtip vortices. As the wing tip passes through the sky, it can dramatically affect the air around it for a long duration, causing disrupted air for following aircraft. Jet-wash, caused by the engines of the aircraft, does not last as long; however, it can be more violent.

Want to know how bad jet-wash can affect an aircraft? Just look at the scene in Top Gun when Maverick loses control and has to eject, killing his Radar Intercept Officer, Goose. That crash was caused by the jet-wash from the proceeding aircraft’s engines. Definitely not something you would want to go through on a regular basis, right?

Although the FAA doesn’t necessarily follow ICAO rules, the two do have very similar designations. The ’œheavy’ designation goes to any aircraft with a takeoff weight of 300,000lb or more, even if they are not operating at that level. So, for instance, any 777 departing or arriving an airport, even if below that 300,000lb weight, would still need to use the “heavy” designation. Any aircraft below 300,000lb would be categorized as ’œlarge’ (though ATC isn’t required to use that term ).

There is one aircraft that doesn’t quite make it to the “heavy” designation that needs extra space, and that is the Boeing 757. Since it has many characteristics of a heavy, but without the takeoff weight of it’s much larger cousins, it is given the same separation but isn’t required to use the designator. But how much separation do they need to give? Here’s a handy little guide:

Preceding aircraft Following aircraft Minimum radar separation Super Super 4 NM

Heavy 6 NM Large 7 NM Small 8 NM Heavy Heavy 4 NM Large 5 NM Small 6 NM Large Small 5 NM

So you may notice an extra category in the above table? The ’œsuper’ designation belongs to one aircraft only – the A380. With the advent of the ’œwhalejet’ came a requirement for a new code, as the A380 needs a much larger separation distance, especially from smaller aircraft. I know I wouldn’t want to get caught in that wake turbulence.

So next time you’re at an airport or listening in to ATC and hear the flights using the terms “heavy” or “super”, you can know that those terms have an underlying meaning to help keep you and other passengers safe in the air. Plus, it gives you and idea how long until that next aircraft is going to pass overhead, and you can impress your friends with your random AvGeek knowledge.

Airbus gets first A380 order for 2014 with $8.3 billion deal | Mint - Mint,"Wed, 12 Feb 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9JbmR1c3RyeS81bGo5OGdxSXNZNDEzM0tCRm12VUJOL0FpcmJ1cy1nZXRzLWZpcnN0LUEzODAtb3JkZXItZm9yLTIwMTQtd2l0aC04My1iaWxsaW9uLWRlYWwuaHRtbNIBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vSW5kdXN0cnkvNWxqOThncUlzWTQxMzNLQkZtdlVCTi9BaXJidXMtZ2V0cy1maXJzdC1BMzgwLW9yZGVyLWZvci0yMDE0LXdpdGgtODMtYmlsbGlvbi1kZWFsLmh0bWw_ZmFjZXQ9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Singapore : Airbus on Wednesday received its first order of the year for its flagship A380 when leasing firm Amedeo signed an $8.3 billion deal for 20 of the superjumbos.

The purchase agreement, signed at the Singapore Airshow, put the European manufacturer on track to meet its target of 30 orders for the world’s largest passenger plane in 2014.

Airbus had suffered some setbacks last year with the discovery of cracks on some of the giant jetliners’ wings.

But John Leahy, its chief operating officer for customers, said: “This firm order from Amedeo is a clear recognition of the A380’s long-term market appeal.

“The A380 is the best tool for airlines to capture growth and increase profits.""

Amedeo, formerly Doric Lease Corp, is the world’s biggest manager of leased A380s.

“As world air traffic continues to double every 15 years and airport infrastructure and slots do not, the A380 is the best solution for airlines to capture that growth,"" said Amedeo chief executive Mark Lapidus.

The orders will be delivered from 2016 to 2020. Amedeo will announce its engine selection later.

“Put it in the right routes at peak traffic times and it is an unbeatable profit-generating machine for airlines,"" Lapidus said.

Airbus said more than 120 A380s are now in operation worldwide following its launch in 2007.

Leahy said the company wants about 30 orders for the A380 this year.

Despite the lift for Airbus from the Amedeo deal, one analyst said it should look beyond the A380.

“It’s more an exception than the rule because we don’t see a huge demand for this aircraft,"" said Shukor Yusof, with Standard and Poor’s Equity Research.

“This is a niche aircraft meant for a small market. Airbus would do much better to focus on the A350,"" he said, referring to a new generation of long-range aircraft.

Airbus says it has received 814 orders so far from 30 countries for the A350-XWB, a wide-body plane due to begin service with Qatar Airways in the fourth quarter of 2014.

The Amedeo order was the second major deal announced by Airbus at the Singapore trade show.

On Tuesday fledgling carrier VietJetAir ordered 63 Airbus A320 jets with a list price of $6.4 billion in an expansion programme that underscores Asia’s central role in the future of world aviation.

The deal also covers rights to acquire or lease 38 more A320s, potentially boosting the budget carrier’s current fleet of 11 A320s tenfold.

Another European plane manufacturer, ATR, secured important contracts on Wednesday.

It signed a nearly $500 million deal with leasing firm Dubai Aerospace Enterprise for 20 ATR 72-600 planes.

It also signed a $150 million agreement with Bangkok Airways for six ATR 72-600s, with an option for the Thai carrier to buy two more.

Dubai Aerospace is the biggest aviation leasing firm in the Middle East, with an aircraft portfolio of about $3.3 billion comprising Boeing B737s and B777s, as well as Airbus A320s and A330s.

It has an option to buy 20 more of the ATR aircraft.

In another deal unveiled at the Singapore show, Thai budget carrier Nok Air on Wednesday committed to buy 15 B737s from Boeing worth $1.45 billion.

The commitment is for eight next-generation 737-800s and seven 737 MAX 8s, Nok Air and Boeing said. AFP

On the comeback trail - Vertical Mag - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 19 Feb 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVzL29udGhlY29tZWJhY2t0cmFpbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"There could be no mistaking the purpose of my visit to the Airbus Helicopters (formerly Eurocopter) Test Center in Marignane, France. The EC225 has been in the headlines for much of the past 18 months, due to the extensive investigation, redesign and testing of the section of its gearbox that caused two high profile ditchings in the North Sea in 2012. With 93 percent of the worldwide EC225/725 fleet now back in service, the manufacturer was keen to showcase its capabilities. In the course of a comprehensive evaluation flight, I saw firsthand how the EC225 has earned its key place in the offshore oil-andgas transport sector.

I was privileged to fly with Airbus Helicopters experimental test pilot Hervé Jammayrac and flight test engineer Christophe Skorlic. We settled into the cockpit to review the systems, Jammayrac explaining that the EC225 is a development of the AS332 Super Puma, which was a late-1970s design. The original Super Puma enjoyed several upgrades, and the EC225 is the latest development of the Super Puma family; but as the new type designator denotes, it is more than just an incremental upgrade. The EC225 incorporates a new five-blade Spheriflex rotor, upgraded Turbomeca Makila 2A1 engines, and digital avionics. Although originally inspired by a French Air Force requirement, with an Airbus Helicopters-designed fouraxis automatic flight control system (AFCS) and optional equipment for flight into known icing, it is no wonder that North Sea offshore operators have embraced it.

Our helicopter was configured for delivery to an offshore operator, but was being used by the Airbus Helicopters Test Center for avionics development. It featured standard traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS II) and enhanced ground proximity warning system (EGPWS), plus optional external fuel tanks and dual Canadian Marconi Corporation (CMC) flight management systems (FMS) for offshore operations. Jammayrac claimed that with a typical 6.4 tonne equipped empty operating weight and an 11 tonne maximum gross weight, the EC225 is generally capable of operations with full passengers and full fuel. For our flight, the helicopter had an empty weight of 13,940 pounds (6,323 kilograms). Payload and crew added 1,730 lb (785 kg), and 5,775 lb (2,620 kg) of fuel was onboard, resulting in a gross takeoff weight of 21,445 lb (9,728 kg). The center of gravity was mid-forward.

Jammayrac talked me through the pre-start checks with the ease of someone who was eager to demonstrate how simple it all was. I would have needed a checklist. It is a complex vehicle, but I was favorably impressed with the cockpit layout.

Powerplant and systems data are depicted on two central 4” by 5” liquid crystal displays (LCDs) called the vehicle monitoring system (VMS). The glass cockpit features two bright 6” by 8” multifunction displays for each pilot. Systems integration was not quite state-of-the-art, in that the FMS was capable of only limited performance calculations, and the VMS included neither system synoptic pages nor electronic checklists. A reconfiguration control panel allows selection of alternate attitude or air data sensors, although no facility exists for automatic reversion or composite display selection. The start procedures were in keeping with a complex multi-engine helicopter; however a trained crew could be ready to “pull pitch” within five minutes of engaging the starters.

Lifting the EC225 into the hover was effortless. The AFCS’s attitude and heading hold modes left me with almost nothing to do. At our operating weight we required 75 percent power to hover in ground effect (IGE), which was reassuringly below the 30 second one engine inoperative (OEI) power limit. We hover taxied to the helipad just behind an NH-90, and in what I presumed to be at least moderate rotor wash turbulence, the AFCS attitude retention system did a marvelous job. Hovering remained precise and easy. I performed a few exploratory pedal turns, finding a surprising amount of directional control power for such a big machine. The pedals were light, without any evident centering force. Heading hold mode engaged, I was told, whenever the yaw rate dropped below eight degrees per second and the pilot released the pedal force microswitch. Elegant.

Going Offshore

Outbound from the Marseille airport, I conducted a cruise performance check at 1,500 feet. With the AFCS engaged in heading, altitude and airspeed modes, I selected maximum continuous power (82.7 percent engine torque). The result, at our admittedly light weight, was 146 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS), which at 46 F (8 C) air temperature worked out to also be 146 knots true airspeed. The engines were burning 1,457 lb/hour (661 kg/hour) total fuel flow. The FADECs provided nearly perfect engine matching. I took a moment to note the ride quality, which I can only describe as fabulous. I noted as much to Jammayrac, and he cheerfully emphasized the point by turning the automatic vibration control system off, which resulted in a much rumblier ride. I asked him to turn it back on. Ah, better.

The main engine power indication was a vertical tape on the left side of the primary flight display, called a first limit indicator (FLI). This innovative display depicted the collective pitch in proportion to the available power margin, whether in all engine operative (AEO) or one engine inoperative (OEI) situations. Its utility became apparent during a simulated engine failure. Cruising with the autopilot engaged in heading, altitude and airspeed hold modes at 130 KIAS at 2,500 feet, a small blue line on the FLI clearly indicated that our current power setting was just above the OEI power available. Jammayrac selected the OEI training switch to simulate failure of the left engine. The response was a momentary mild yaw and a prompt collective reduction by the AFCS to respect the 30 second OEI HIGH power limit. As the end of the OEI HIGH power limit approached, I manually selected OEI LOW power limit, followed by continuous power limit. In each case, the AFCS selected the appropriate power setting as we continued on course. The combination of smooth FADEC engine control, compelling displays and generous power margins made the engine failure a non-event.

To better see the EC225 in its element, I performed a coupled approach to a shipping buoy that was, in my vivid imagination, impersonating a North Sea oil rig. As we passed over top, I designated the target using the AFCS’s F/TDN button, denoting a “fix – transition down.” The weather radar picture was overlaid upon the GPS track to show our closure to target. The avionics responded by immediately depicting a 180-degree procedure turn into the prevailing wind on the navigation display, which it followed in a smooth transition to a hover, terminating in groundspeed and height hold mode at 120 feet, 0.1 nm from the buoy. From there it was a simple process to use the cyclicand collective-mounted switches to beep the hover position wherever desired. With its simple interface and smooth predictable performance, I found that the EC225’s AFCS among its most impressive features.

Returning to Marseille, Jammayrac had another demonstration in store. An NH90 was cruising about a mile ahead of us. With a few words on the radio, he arranged for the NH90 to perform a dogleg maneuver such that our flight paths would intersect. As we cruised along with the autopilot engaged, Jammayrac simply pointed to the NH90 and indicated that I should watch. The TCAS began to squawk a traffic advisory, followed by a resolution advisory, which necessitated evasive maneuvering. That’s just what the autopilot did, in the form of a smooth descent to pass several hundred feet below the simulated intruder. When clear of traffic, the autopilot climbed and resumed its original heading, altitude and airspeed — an impressive demonstration indeed! Airbus Helicopters claims that the EC225 is currently the only helicopter certified with this capability.

It is understandable that much of what has been said and written about the EC225 recently has featured the word “gearbox.” The combination of mechanical and electrical deficiencies that resulted in two nearly identical EC225 accidents is lamentable indeed. There can be no doubt that Airbus Helicopters is working hard to put that episode behind them. For my part, my flight in the EC225 convincingly demonstrated that it was a helicopter with impressive performance and capability."

“Today’s agreement with Airbus Helicopters significantly expands our fleet and brings real advantages to some of the world’s leading operators that rely on our services,” said Ed Washecka, CEO of Waypoint Leasing. “Our relationship with Airbus Helicopters will allow us to provide our customers with a wider range of aircraft to better meet their needs and accomplish their missions prudently and efficiently.”

Guillaume Faury, president of Airbus Helicopters, said: “We are taking our relationship to new heights today with major orders that are tailor-made for Waypoint Leasing’s requirements. This further underscores the value of leasing when helicopter manufacturers and leasing companies work together to ensure heli-lift capacity is aligned with market demand.”"
Analysis: Airbus faces tough battles over A330 longevity plan - Yahoo News UK,"Tue, 25 Feb 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vdWsubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vY2VsZWJyaXR5L2FuYWx5c2lzLWFpcmJ1cy1mYWNlcy10b3VnaC1iYXR0bGVzLTIwMzkwMTY0MS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Siva Govindasamy and Tim Hepher

SINGAPORE/PARIS (Reuters) - As Airbus (AIR.PA) races through flight testing of its newest plane, the next-generation A350, Europe's planemaker faces growing battles to secure a future for the A330, until now its only truly lucrative wide-body jet.

Twenty years after it entered service, the 250 to 300-seat jet has repeatedly been pronounced dead by rival Boeing (NYS:BA) but refuses to lie down, outliving its A340 sibling and surviving for now the arrival of lighter new jets like Boeing's 787 and the A350.

But analysts say time is finally ticking on Airbus's most profitable wide-body jet, despite a steady series of changes aimed at prolonging the end of its production cycle and with over 1,000 still in service.

Without a fresh burst of sales or a slowdown from current record production levels, they say, Airbus faces a sharp drop in deliveries from 2016 onwards, with the visible backlog of undelivered aircraft now worth just 26 months of production.

""The A330 had an amazing past five years, not only because of its merits, but because Boeing's 787 was delayed,"" said industry analyst Richard Aboulafia at Teal Group.

""But with the 787 hitting (its targeted) production of 10 aircraft per month, that is going to crowd the A330 out of the market space pretty quickly,"" he added.

That leaves Airbus with a two-fold challenge. It must decide

how best to maintain a foothold in the 200 to 300-seat market, where it first developed jets more than 40 years ago and which Boeing later targeted in part with its 787 family.

The version of the A350 that Airbus originally hoped would defend that spot, the 270-seat A350-800, has sold poorly and is likely to remain sidelined compared to the 314-seat A350-900.

And with the A350 only gradually building up output until 2018, experts say Airbus faces a hole in revenue and cash flow as a gap opens between peak output of the A330 and that of the A350 -just as it also wrestles with a complex transition between versions of its other main cash cow, the A320.

Story continues

Even though orders may not be as bleak as they appear, with some countries still to approve deals, Airbus has already started looking at ways of heading off any output gaps.

Last year it broke from a pattern of beefing up the A330 to fly further with more payload and announced a leaner Regional version to compete in the key Chinese domestic market.

Ostensibly the aircraft is the same, but its performance will be artificially capped to help save airlines save on maintenance and statutory bills like landing fees.

Such an aircraft would be a niche product aimed at countries with congested domestic markets like China and India.

Morphing the plane in a different direction, Airbus is also looking at the possibility of new engines to boost performance in its core activity of flying medium- and long-haul routes.

It has given itself until the end of the year to make a decision but could make a move at Farnborough Airshow in July.

COUNTER-OFFENSIVE

But industry sources say Airbus has already raised the stakes by offering to increase its industrial presence in China with an A330 cabin centre. It already assembles small jets there.

""We have always been open to additional industrial co-operation when the market supports it,"" Chief Executive Fabrice Bregier said at the recent Singapore Airshow, asked about the first report of such a proposal in Aviation Week.

In response, market watchers say Boeing has launched a counter-offensive to halt the A330's latest assault on China.

Officials with the U.S. firm acknowledge that Airbus's A330 Regional would save just over 10 percent in operating costs.

But they argue this would not compensate for the extra fuel needed for a heavy aircraft like the A330 when it is operating on short routes instead of the long ones it was designed for.

Adapting the industry playbook, they say it would be more profitable to fly two smaller Boeing 737s instead, because the Airbus would burn 12 percent more fuel than both combined.

Airbus officials argue that China's crowded skies and airport congestion rule out adding flights, so the only option is to boost capacity. About 80 percent of China's airspace is under military control, leaving scarce room for traffic development.

That could be changing as China seeks to boost the low-cost airline sector but there is no clear-cut rule on whether more flights are the right marketing tool, said Ascend analyst Rob Morris.

STRATEGIC MARKET, TACTICAL TOOLS

But critics of Airbus's plans have a fallback argument.

Boeing, they say, is likely to try to persuade Chinese airlines that even if they want to put A330s on domestic routes to ease congestion it would be better for their balance sheets and more practical to redeploy them from international ones, rather than buy even more A330s with declining resale values.

Airbus officials counter that it would cost millions of dollars to reconfigure jets in that way.

China is one of the most strategic markets for both companies but analysts say they are also behaving tactically.

Both have gambled on lighter weight carbon-fibre technology but are unable to deliver as quickly as airlines would like, and are meanwhile carving out sales pitches playing up their existing products.

The battle looks set to revive tensions between the two dominant planemakers in the $100 billion annual jetliner market that last erupted in an advertising war in 2012.

Taking aim at Airbus's flexibility over pricing of the A330, whose development was paid for long ago, a Boeing executive said it would be a ""losing proposition"" against the smaller 737 in China, even if Airbus gave up any gap in price.

An Airbus official retorted curtly, saying Boeing's own data was ""veracity-challenged"".

Procedural hurdles are likely to delay the debut of Airbus A380 services in India, despite the country last month lifting a ban on landing the world’s largest passenger jet in four of its airports. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation has yet to certify the airports in Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad as A380-compliant.While this would delay the plans of Emirates and Singapore Airlines to fly their A380s to the country, airlines like Lufthansa, Cathay Pacific and British Airways will likely have to wait also for India to revise its bilateral air-service agreements with their home countries, a senior aviation ministry official told ET.The jetliner’s size is the issue in both cases. “The bilaterals with Germany (Lufthansa), Hong Kong (Cathay) and the UK (British Airways) would need to be revised as the entitlements given to them are in terms of frequencies per week,” the official said.“This needs to be converted into seats per week to ensure that no additional capacity is being given to these countries.” Germany, for example, has 65 frequencies to India per week and the aircraft considered for this was Boeing 747. The 747, the largest passenger jet before the A380 was introduced, is designed to carry up to 467 passengers while the A380 can carry 525 passengers.“For example, a Boeing 747 operation with one flight a day would mean a country is getting 3,270 seats per week, while the same on an A380 would mean about 3,700 seats per week,” the official said. “Therefore, we need to convert the frequencies per week to seats per week so that there is no change in seat capacities.” This issue won’t hurt Emirates and Singapore Airlines as the bilateral agreements with Singapore and the UAE are already on the basis of seats per week.The hurdle for them is the absence of A380 compliance certification for the airports in Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad. While the airports have the runways to handle the A380, we would need to ensure that they have the baggage handling equipment, aerobridges, aircraft tow trucks and other such equipment in place for A380 operations,” the official said. These issues are set to delay the plans of airlines to introduce the A380 on India routes to reduce costs while catering to increasing demand for international travel."

The entire Airbus A319 jet is dedicated to business class, with just 40 seats.

Each seat, in rows of four, will fully recline and offer a big-screen entertainment system with more than 900 movies, TV shows, and video games to choose from.

The airline already operates five daily flights between the cities, this service will bring its weekly frequency from 35 to 42 flights. The A319 already in use by Qatar seats 102 economy and 8 first class passengers, according to SeatGuru.com.

Airbus Group: “India remains a promising defence market” - Indian Defence Review,"Fri, 07 Feb 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhbmRlZmVuY2VyZXZpZXcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWdyb3VwLWluZGlhLXJlbWFpbnMtYS1wcm9taXNpbmctZGVmZW5jZS1tYXJrZXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"EADS has reorganized and rebranded to Airbus Group effective 1 January 2014. Why?

Firstly, budgets of our traditional defence and institutional customers, especially those of our ‘home nations’ are flat if not shrinking and this is expected to be the case for at least the remainder of this decade. Secondly, exports to growth markets are no easy and quick way out unless our Group has, beyond superior products, also a competitive cost structure and an excellent global sales network. In addition, the Group’s defence business was scattered and fragmented across all four divisions, which was not a good setup in terms of efficiency and competitiveness.

Therefore, the decision to bring together former Cassidian, Astrium and Airbus Military under one roof: Airbus Defence and Space. The new organizational structure will strengthen our market position, boost profitability and ensure robust future growth. Entire Group has been rebranded to Airbus for the simple reason that it is our international flagship and by far our most well known brand internationally.

Can you elaborate the new structure a bit more?

Sure. Airbus Group is now home to: Airbus, Airbus Defence and Space, and Airbus Helicopters. With Airbus, we will continue to remain a leader in commercial aerospace. With Airbus Defence and Space, we preserve a strong, profitable defence and space business. The new division has around €14 billion in sales and employs around 45,000 people. Airbus Helicopters handles all commercial and military helicopter activities. The focus and core identity of the Airbus Group will remain aeronautics and space adding up to more than 95% of its activities.

…we are cooperating with Indian companies in establishing offshore development centres here. In all, we employ around 2000 in engineering roles in India.

Will restructuring hamper your ongoing programmes in India?

The restructuring and rebranding will not hamper our ongoing programmes in India. In fact, the new organization will support our growth here.

How do you view India as an engineering destination?

India is an important engineering and R&D hub for us. We have two captive engineering centers and an Airbus Group Innovations’ R&D facility in Bengaluru. The Airbus Defence and Space Engineering Centre is the first ever defence oriented engineering centre in India owned by a foreign company. Inaugurated in 2011, Indian engineers there have developed two products: a Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) compliant Altimetry System and a Structurally Integrated Antenna. On the other hand, Airbus Engineering Centre specializes in high-tech aeronautical engineering and works closely with other Airbus Engineering Centres around the world, as well as with the Indian aviation industry. Airbus Group Innovations’ centre focuses on research in areas such as aerothermics, cloud computing and cognitive radars. In addition, we are cooperating with Indian companies in establishing offshore development centres here. In all, we employ around 2000 (including subcontractors) in engineering roles in India.

You claim to be supporting India’s indigenization efforts in defence. Can you give some examples for it?

Airbus Defence and Space, has successfully cooperated with India’s Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO) to develop a missile approach warning sensor (MILDS). The sensor has been certified as ‘indigenous’ by Indian authorities and is produced locally for fitment in Indian Army’s Cheetah and Chetak helicopter fleet. Airbus Defence and Space is also consulting the DRDO on naval-Light Combat Aircraft. In addition, both sides are jointly reviewing an indigenous Airborne Early Warning & Control System. In terms of cooperation with the Indian industry, Airbus Defence and Space has a joint venture with Larsen & Toubro in the field of defence electronics. Space is another frontier where we are closely collaborating with India. Airbus Defence and Space has a long-term working relationship with Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) and its commercial arm Antrix. Both sides have jointly designed, produced and marketed telecom satellites.

It is a proven reference and a win-win solution which we are ready to replicate in defence. Talking about Airbus Helicopters, it has offered the EC725 along with transfer of technology for India’s requirement of 120 Naval Multi-Role Helicopters. In addition, MBDA, a missile manufacturer in which Airbus Group is a shareholder, is holding discussions with the DRDO to jointly develop a brand new short range surface to air missile (SR-SAM) which will be produced in India by Bharat Dynamics Limited.

MoD is facing budget issues. How does that affect you?

We understand very well the situation of the Government of India. Given, the current global economic scenario defence spending is under scrutiny all over the world. Having said that, I think the Indian Government also has a very clear understanding of what its priorities in the defence area are. We are here for the long term so these temporary budget cuts do not really make much difference to us. India is one of the world’s most vibrant and growing economies and remains a promising defence market.

This will secure the self-reliance of India’s armed forces without compromising national security and will also have a positive ripple effect on India’s economy.

What are the main challenges of doing defence business in India?

The challenges here are the same as everywhere else. Defence procurement is a time consuming, complex process everywhere in the world. What is important is that the Government of India is committed to modernizing the nation’s armed forces, is focusing on quality equipment and is promoting indigenization. This works to our favour as we genuinely support development of India’s own defence-industrial base since that would open up more opportunities for us to collaborate with local companies.

What is your view on the 26% cap in FDI in defence?

Currently, foreign direct investment (FDI) in defence is capped at 26 per cent with the provision for the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) to allow higher limits on a case-to-case basis. We respect Indian Government’s stand but we believe that should this cap be liberalized it will be easier for us to develop a larger industrial base here and transfer even more cutting-edge technologies. This will secure the self-reliance of India’s armed forces without compromising national security and will also have a positive ripple effect on India’s economy.

Among all the acquisition programmes that you are participating in India which one interests you the most?

All the programmes we are participating in India are important to us. However, I would like to stress that there is more to what interests us here than just the sales campaigns. We regard India as a strategic ‘resource hub’ for the Group. The engineering centres that we have invested in here and the joint development approach in collaboration with local partners that we are pursuing are proof of this. Our partnership with India in the field of defence rests firmly on our open approach towards transfer of advanced technologies and know-how to the country. We wish to become a household name in India. The restructuring and rebranding to Airbus will aid us in this endeavour.

How significant is Defexpo 2014 for you and what will you be putting on display?

Defexpo is an important trade show and provides us with an excellent platform to interact with customers and potential partners. This will be Airbus Group’s first international show under the new brand. On display at our stand (Hall 11, Stand 19) will be a broad range of cutting-edge products, technologies and services from Airbus Defence and Space and Airbus Helicopters. These include models of AS550 C3 Fennec, AS565 MBe Panther, EC725, TANAN™ 300 and other systems like radars, sensors and next-generation satcom terminals. AS550 C3 Fennec is in race for the Indian Army’s and Air Force’s 197 Reconnaissance and Surveillance Helicopter (RSH) competition while the AS565 MBe naval version has been proposed for the Indian Navy’s requirement for 56 Naval Utility Helicopters (NUH) and 16 ship-based helicopters for the Indian Coast Guard. The EC725 fitted with comprehensive naval warfare suite including Radar, Sonar, Sonobuoys and SENSO consoles with the relevant weaponry has been proposed for the 120 Naval Multi-Role Helicopter (NMRH) campaign. TANAN™ 300 is a diesel engine powered tactical vertical takeoff and landing unmanned aerial system especially suited for maritime surveillance."
SIA grounds A380 after scratches found on fuselage - Yahoo Singapore News,"Wed, 05 Feb 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHA6Ly9zZy5uZXdzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9zaWEtZ3JvdW5kcy1hMzgwLXNjcmF0Y2hlcy1mb3VuZC1mdXNlbGFnZS0wNTQ3NDM2MDAtLWZpbmFuY2UuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Singapore Airlines said Wednesday it had grounded an Airbus A380 superjumbo for further inspection after scratches were found on its fuselage. The scratches were discovered after the double-decker plane, the world's biggest passenger aircraft, arrived in Frankfurt on Sunday from New York, SIA said in a statement. There were 126 passengers and 26 crew onboard. ""The aircraft was subsequently grounded for checks and passengers were either transferred to other airlines or accommodated in hotels,"" the statement said. ""Following inspections by engineering teams in Frankfurt, it was determined that the scratches posed no safety issue and the aircraft was cleared for departure."" The plane arrived in Singapore on Tuesday after a 23-hour delay and has been grounded for further checks. SIA said the cause of the scratches has yet to be established. ""Our engineers are currently performing further checks on the aircraft, and it will resume service once cleared,"" the airline said. A source close to Airbus told AFP in Paris on Wednesday that the scratches were probably caused by a ""defrosting system"" at the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. Experts say the defrosting equipment is used to remove and prevent the build-up of ice on the plane's outer surface, especially on the wings and fuselage, by spraying chemicals using high-pressure water jets. The United States has been hit by extra-cold weather in recent weeks, with a massive storm on Tuesday bringing with it a dangerous mix of frozen rain and sleet. The incident on Sunday was the second for SIA in less than a month involving an Airbus 380. On January 6, an SIA A380 en route from London to Singapore lost cabin pressure, forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing in the Azerbaijan capital of Baku. Oxygen masks were activated during the emergency procedure which some passengers described as ""frightening"". The stranded 467 passengers and 27 crew on board were flown back to Singapore with a replacement aircraft. The plane involved in the Baku incident was back in service, SIA said Wednesday, but added that the ""root cause"" of the incident remained under investigation. SIA had previously said that the focus of the probe was a door on the main deck that appeared to have suffered a leak, leading to the change in cabin pressure. There are 119 Airbus A380s in operation globally, according to latest data from the company. Singapore Airlines currently has a fleet of 19 A380s, with five others on order."

Emirates plans to fly in Airbus A380 for Hyderabad airshow | Mint - Mint,"Wed, 19 Feb 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9Db21wYW5pZXMvWnhkbEh2VDcxYnZOWWM2a1JBeElwSS9FbWlyYXRlcy1wbGFucy10by1mbHktaW4tQWlyYnVzLUEzODAtZm9yLUh5ZGVyYWJhZC1haXJzaG93Lmh0bWzSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGl2ZW1pbnQuY29tL0NvbXBhbmllcy9aeGRsSHZUNzFidk5ZYzZrUkF4SXBJL0VtaXJhdGVzLXBsYW5zLXRvLWZseS1pbi1BaXJidXMtQTM4MC1mb3ItSHlkZXJhYmFkLWFpcnNob3cuaHRtbD9mYWNldD1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"New Delhi: Dubai-based Emirates airline plans to fly in the Airbus A380 plane, the world’s largest passenger airline, to the Hyderabad airshow next month, with India lifting its ban on the super jumbo jets a fortnight ago.

The airshow, called India Aviation 2014, will be held on 12-16 March. Emirates agreed to bring the plane to Hyderabad in what may be a precursor to it operating the A380s in India later, said a person familiar with the matter, declining to be named.

“Emirates has agreed to bring in its A380 for the airshow; it will be there for four days,"" said the person. “We are hoping the Telangana agitation will be over by then. But the security will be high this time.""

An Emirates spokesman confirmed the plan.

“We are working with the authorities to bring the A380 to Hyderabad for the Hyderabad airshow,"" the spokesman said.

The gigantic A380, which made its first flight in 2005 and entered commercial service two years later, can carry up to 850 passengers in an all-economy configuration, allowing airlines to transport more travellers without significantly adding flights.

Emirates’ A380 planes typically have 399 seats in economy, 76 lie-flat seats in business and 14 luxury private suites. Passengers travelling in private suites can freshen up in one of the two on-board shower spas.

Currently, there are 114 A380 planes flying on various routes worldwide, and Airbus S.A.S has firm orders for another 262 planes, according to the company.

Nine of the 10 airlines that currently fly the A380 have scheduled flights into India. Besides Emirates, Deutsche Lufthansa AG and Singapore Airlines Ltd have said they were keen to fly the A380 planes to India. But India had decided to not allow foreign airlines to fly the A380s into the country as the planes were seen as a threat to local airlines. Also, only four Indian airports—Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Bangalore—have the infrastructure needed to handle the A380s.

The A380 has been showcased at the Hyderabad airshow before, in October 2011, but that was an Airbus sample plane without all the fittings. The same month, Emirates made an emergency landing at the Hyderabad airport of an A380 plane that was bound to Dubai from Bangkok.

At the latest airshow in Hyderabad, the A380 will be flanked by about 25 other planes that have confirmed participation.

The highlight will be Air India’s 13th Dreamliner 787 plane, which will fly directly from Boeing Co.’s factory in Seattle to Hyderabad, where aviation minister Ajit Singh and other dignitaries will take its delivery to mark the launch of the airshow, a second official who also did not want to be named said.

Airbus, which flew down its newest aircraft, the inter-continental Airbus A350 XWB, to the Singapore airshow this month, is not bringing it to Hyderabad.

The director general of civil aviation, or DGCA, has cleared a proposal by the aviation ministry to allow aircraft to fly low for a fly-past and aerobatics as in other airshows.

A two-aircraft team from the UK has been hired for twice daily aerobatics performances at the Hyderabad airshow. The Indian Air Forces’ helicopter display team Sarang also has been invited.

Competition in India’s aviation sector is heating up with two new airlines planned to be launched in the country. The Tata group is preparing to launch a full-service airline in partnership with Singapore Airlines and a low-cost venture with AirAsia Bhd, marking its return to aviation after a gap of 60 years.

Ratan Tata, chairman emeritus of the Tata group, however, declined the aviation ministry’s invitation to deliver the keynote address at the inaugural session of the event on 12 March. Tata, who has a private pilot licence and flies often himself, put this down to a prior engagement.

The RAF has grounded its fleet of military-registered Voyager planes after one plummeted ""several thousand feet"" during a flight to Afghanistan.

The Airbus 330 is believed to have dropped sharply for unknown reasons on Sunday, leaving some of its 180 passengers and 10 crew members with minor injuries.

The crew levelled the plane out, and it was diverted to an airfield in Turkey. Affected passengers are being brought back to the UK on another aircraft.

A Ministry of Defence spokesman confirmed that it had been decided to ""temporarily pause"" flying of the aircraft Voyager while a full investigation into what could have caused the sudden drop in altitude is completed.

The Voyager, which was provided to the RAF under a £10.5 billion private finance initiative with the AirTanker consortium, has a dual role as an air-to-air tanker and transport aircraft, replacing the long-serving VC10 and TriStar planes.

The spokesman said: ""MoD can confirm that a Voyager aircraft suffered an in-flight issue on 9 February and as a precaution diverted to an airfield in Turkey.

""A few passengers received minor injuries during the incident.

""The safety of all our air crews and passengers is our paramount concern, therefore it has been decided to temporarily pause military-registered Voyager flying while a full investigation is completed.""

The RAF has civil-registered Voyagers, which fly to the Falklands and other places, and military-registered ones which fly to Afghanistan.

The military-registered planes have been grounded as a precaution while investigations are carried out, but the civil aircraft will continue to fly.

It is thought that the incident could result in delays to some personnel flying to and from Afghanistan. Alternative travel arrangements are being put in place.

Loss-making state-owned Kuwait Airways Co signed contracts with Airbus Wednesday to buy 25 planes, its first order for new aircraft in more than 20 years, the airline?s chairwoman said.

Under the deals, KAC will buy 15 A320neo and 10 A350-900 aircraft, with an option to buy 10 more -- five from each category, said Rasha al-Rumi, cited by the official KUNA news agency.

Delivery is to commence in 2019.

The second contract stipulates the lease of seven A320s and five A330s.

They will start arriving in December and will all be delivered before next summer, said Rumi, who was appointed to the post last month.

The value of the deals was not disclosed but local media put the figure at around $4.0 billion (2.9 billion euros).

KAC, which is being readied for privatisation, and Airbus signed a memorandum of understanding in December.

Earlier this month, parliament called on its legal committee to investigate the new deals by KAC, and the probe should be completed within one month.

The airlines has an ageing fleet of 15 Airbus and two Boeing aircraft.

In addition to modernising its fleet, the KAC wants to become profitable before offering a 40 percent stake to a local or foreign investor.

It has posted losses in all but one of the past 21 years, amounting to a total of more than $2.7 billion (two billion euros), which has been covered by the government."
Singapore Airlines grounds A380 - Bangkok Post,"Wed, 05 Feb 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbmdrb2twb3N0LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9nZW5lcmFsLzM5MzM5MNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Singapore Airlines grounds A380

SINGAPORE - Singapore Airlines (SIA) said Wednesday it had grounded an Airbus A380 superjumbo for further inspection after scratches were found on its fuselage.

The scratches were discovered after the double-decker plane, the world's biggest passenger aircraft, arrived in Frankfurt on Sunday from New York, SIA said in a statement.

There were 126 passengers and 26 crew onboard.

''The aircraft was subsequently grounded for checks and passengers were either transferred to other airlines or accommodated in hotels,'' the statement said.

''Following inspections by engineering teams in Frankfurt, it was determined that the scratches posed no safety issue and the aircraft was cleared for departure.''

The plane arrived in Singapore on Tuesday after a 23-hour delay and has been grounded for further checks.

SIA said the cause of the scratches has yet to be established.

''Our engineers are currently performing further checks on the aircraft, and it will resume service once cleared,'' the airline said.

It was the second incident for SIA in less than a month involving an Airbus 380.

Last Jan 6, an SIA A380 en route from London to Singapore lost cabin pressure, forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing in the Azerbaijan capital of Baku.

Oxygen masks were activated during the emergency procedure which some passengers described as ''frightening''.

The stranded 467 passengers and 27 crew on board were flown back to Singapore with a replacement aircraft.

The plane involved in the Baku incident was back in service, SIA said Wednesday, but added that the ''root cause'' of the incident remained under investigation.

SIA had previously said that focus of the probe was a door on the main deck that appeared to have suffered a leak, leading to the change in cabin pressure.

There are 119 Airbus A380s in operation globally, according to latest data from the company.

Singapore Airlines currently has a fleet of 19 A380s, with five others on order.

Kuwait-Airbus Deal On Track Despite Probe - Gulf Business,"Sun, 09 Feb 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vZ3VsZmJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9rdXdhaXQtYWlyYnVzLWRlYWwtdHJhY2stZGVzcGl0ZS1wcm9iZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A parliamentary investigation into a Kuwait Airways plan to buy and lease aircraft from Airbus will not affect the deal, the state carrier’s chairwoman told a local newspaper in comments published on Sunday.

Kuwait’s parliament voted on Wednesday to investigate all contracts signed by state-owned Kuwait Airways, which is attempting its biggest overhaul since the 1990 Iraqi invasion.

Such parliamentary inquiries are common in Kuwait, where lawmakers in the Gulf state’s National Assembly often question large government projects and have delayed or scuppered them in the past.

Al-Anba newspaper quoted Kuwait Airways chairwoman Rasha al-Roumi as saying the deal would be completed without being delayed.

In December the loss-making airline signed a provisional agreement with Airbus to buy 25 new aircraft in a deal worth $4.4 billion at list prices.

The order would include the purchase of 10 A350-900 and 15 medium-haul A320neo jets. The airline also aims to lease 12 aircraft from Airbus pending delivery of the new planes.

The two companies are now going over technical and legal aspects of the deal, Al-Anba said. A final contract will only be signed when an internal Kuwait Airways commission gives the green light, it added.

A Kuwait Airways spokesman was not immediately available for comment on the report.

Politics and bureaucracy have long complicated Kuwait’s plans to modernise its infrastructure and compete as a Gulf financial hub.

The carrier has one of the oldest fleets in the Middle East and wants to take out of service 11 jets from its fleet of 17, in which the planes’ average age is 18 years."
Airbus Helicopters: EC725 for Indian Navy - Indian Defence Review,"Sat, 08 Feb 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhbmRlZmVuY2VyZXZpZXcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLWVjNzI1LWZvci1pbmRpYW4tbmF2eS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters’ EC725 is the most adaptable and cost-effective solution to respond to the requirement of the Indian Navy for a quickly deliverable Naval Multi Role Helicopter.

The EC725 is outstanding… and is thus fits perfectly the Indian Navy requirements for ASuW, Special forces, Amphibious assault, Troop carrier, SAR and CSAR operations.

The EC725 solution for Indian Navy is based on a multi-role helicopter. The proposed multi-role configuration provides maximum flexibility and utility for operations in the following mission scenarios: ASW, ASuW, Special Operation, Commando Operation, Amphibious assault, Troop Carrier, ELINT, SAR, External cargo carrying, Casualty evacuation, Communication duties and CSAR.

The EC725 is the most recent addition to the COUGAR family, which itself has grown from the vast experience gained over many years with its civil variant, the SUPER PUMA. The Super Puma and Cougar family of around 650 helicopters has amassed more than 3.3 million flight hours and is used by 86 operators in 46 countries. Worldwide military operators of the 470 Cougars delivered span 33 nations; including 29 Air Forces, 7 Army Aviation units and 5 Navies.

The EC725 represents a real technological advancement and is the latest version of this medium lift (11-ton class) helicopter. It has been designed for today’s most demanding military missions. Introduced in 2005, the EC725 is already a combat proven multi-role helicopter and has seen combat service worldwide, including Lebanon, Afghanistan and recently Africa. The EC725 has operated from ships and ashore. It is a truly multi-purpose, versatile military asset. Special Operations, Combat SAR and Personal Recovery require performance, precise navigation and survivability. The EC725 is outstanding in these aspects and is thus fits perfectly the Indian Navy requirements for ASuW, Special forces, Amphibious assault, Troop carrier, SAR and CSAR operations.

The 5 bladed main rotor system with 3rd generation composite blades offers the lowest vibration level in helicopters of its class.

It has been developed jointly with the French Armed Forces for the most demanding missions: Tactical Air Lift and Special Operations. These origins allow EC725 to perfectly fulfill troop transportation missions with maximum effectiveness, survivability and maintenance simplification. Airbus Helicopters has also included in its design the most demanding civilian specifications for SAR and Offshore operations concerning safety, comfort, availability and low cost of operation.

The EC725 is the clear reference for Combat SAR. The French Armed Forces were looking for a helicopter which would comply with the most demanding requirements, to warrant the success of a mission performed in enemy area. The major requirements from the French Armed Forces were:

A very short time from ground alert to flight

Long range and high payload, with at least 20 commandos on board.

All-weather capability and fully autonomous navigation system

High level of systems redundancy and high survivability to bullet impacts

State of the art “Man-Machine Interface” not only to facilitate crew work tohighly improve situation awareness, allowing them to take the best decisions; but also to ease training and conversion programs.

Forward sliding windows on both sides for firing machine guns without interfering at the main doors during hoist, fast roping and rappelling operations.

The EC725 is fast becoming a reference in Asia as the most cost effective latest generation military helicopter. In 2010, Malaysia signed a contract for 12 EC725 and in 2012, Indonesia signed a contract for 6 EC725 after Brazil’s decision in 2009 to acquire 50 EC725 and Mexico 15 EC725.

Ec725 Platform Technical Highlights

Full Glass Cockpit – Advanced Helicopter Cockpit Avionics System

The EC725 provides a modern NVG compatible Mission Cockpit enabling low crew workload and full situation awareness:

The Advanced Helicopter Cockpit Avionics System (AHCAS) is composed of 4 Multi Function Displays (MFD), 2 Vehicle Management System colour displays (VMS), 1 Integrated Stand-by Instrument LCD (ISI) and new 4-axis Digital Automatic Flight Control System (DAFCS), Air Data Computer (ADC) and Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS).

The only autopilot designed specifically for helicopter

The EC725 is fitted with the latest generation 4-axis dual duplex autopilot; it is fully certified with automatic transition to hover and automatic hover, combining data from GPS and Doppler. This capability provides precision hover, which can be controlled from the cabin by the crewman if required, which has proven to be highly effective when conducting winching and fast roping operations.

In addition, the ability to automatically transition to a hover is a significant safety enhancement when conducting deck operations embarked and when working in ‘brownout’ conditions. Operations in limited visibility are also enhanced with the automatic go around facility, which at the push of a single button will fly the aircraft safely away from the ground ‘hands off’ and establish a pre-determined safe flight configuration without further pilot intervention.

The Dual Duplex 4-axis Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS) provides unrivalled functionality plus ‘carefree’ handling to provide a safety envelope to ensure that the aircraft envelope and limitations are not exceeded in normal flight or in emergencies.

Aircraft Performance and Manoeuvrability

The EC725 is fitted with 2 TurbomecaMakila 2A1 turboshaft engines, each controlled by dual channel FADEC, with turbine burst protection; providing higher cruising speeds for greater mission effectiveness coupled with high levels of reliability. Easy to maintain and repair, the Makila 2A is equipped with the new blade shedding technology and is composed of 4 modules, independently interchangeable to reduce downtime.

The 5 bladed main rotor system with 3rd generation composite blades offers the lowest vibration level in helicopters of its class. Combined with the Active Vibration Control system (AVCS), the EC725 cabin and cockpit vibration level remains below 0.1 g.

Survivability

Inherent survivability on the EC725 is provided by:

Low noise signature and Aircraft agility

Twin engines allowing super contingency power and blade shedding technology

Redundant lubrication for the main transmission with certified dry-run capability

Triple hydraulic pump, dual electrical system, dual cockpit controls

Dual COM/NAV equipment, fully redundant MFD’s, dual duplex AFCS

Wire Strike Protection System

Ballistic protection (main and rotor blades resistant to 12,7 mm bullet impact)

Armoured seats for the crew

Self-sealing and crashworthy fuel tanks

Suppressing gun fire

MGB ‘dry run’ capability (30 min of flight after total loss of MGB lubrication)

Bird impact qualified windshields

Spacious cabin

The EC725 cabin has been optimised to deliver a safe, flexible and effective operating environment in order to deliver the greatest military effect into small landing sites, whilst minimising the effects of downwash, which is particularly useful in urban environment.

The EC725 range in Ferry configuration is 518 nm with standard fuel tanks.This range can even be increased…

The Indian Navy’s requirement for amphibious and commando operations requires a helicopter that can offer a range of cabin configurations with seating configurationsof up to 20 seats. The EC725 spacious cabin offers seating from 2 to 28 seats. Ease of access and safety is also ensured thanks to the unique ‘metro’ door design (easy loading and unloading of troops with bulky equipment). The sliding window allows crew served machine guns to be deployed from each side of the aircraft without blocking the main doors (drawback that many in-service helicopters currently face).

The EC725 has a high degree of flexibility when serving medical roles. It can transport up to 11 battle casualties on stretchers and accommodate 4 seats for medical crew or seated patients.

Long range capacity

The EC725 range in Ferry configuration is 518 nm with standard fuel tanks.This range can even be increased by removing some items from ASuW configuration (e.g. air conditioning, tactical console, etc.).

As Navy missions often involve far away Landing Zones with limited possibilities for refuelling, long range capabilities becomes a key aspect of the Navy helicopter.

To extend significantly the radius of action while no means can be reached for intermediate refuelling, the EC725 can be equipped with a jettisonable 990 litres capacity fuel tank installed in the intermediate structure. This installation, including pyrotechnic jettison device is fully approved by French DGA in June 2012."

"Airbus Group reports profit jump, record activity in 2013 - SKNVibes.com","Wed, 26 Feb 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHA6Ly93d3cuc2tudmliZXMuY29tL25ld3MvbmV3c2RldGFpbHMuY2ZtLzg1Nzg20gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Toulouse, FRA) - European aerospace giant Airbus Group reported on Wednesday record performances last year and a jump in net profit despite unexpected costs for a new airliner and its defence arm.

As air traffic enters a new phase of growth, and airlines queue up to re-equip their fleets with new and more efficient aircraft, the baseline figures are huge.

Airbus took orders worth 218.7 billion euros ($300.6 billion) last year and the order book is now worth a record 686.7 billion euros.

Net profit rose by 22.0 percent from the 2012 figure to 1.5 billion euros, and operating profit rose by 21.0 percent to 3.6 billion euros.

The company, the main competitor to US aircraft maker Boeing, is based on making airliners but has other big aerospace activities. It said that orders placed with the Space division last year were also strong.

Demand for its medium-range A320 plane was so strong that it had decided to increase production from 42 a month now to 46 in the second quarter of 2016.

The group has outstanding orders for more than 4,200 single-aisle airliners.

Chief executive Tom Enders said in a results statement that in 2013 ""we again increased revenues and profits, achieved record aircraft deliveries, the A350 XWB's first flight and initial A400M deliveries.""

""Order intake was particularly strong for our Airbus commercial aircraft and provides a solid platform for the future growth of our group.""

Group sales in 2013 rose by 5.0 percent to 59.3 billion euros, driven by the high level of deliveries of commercial airliners and by delivery of the first versions of the A400M military transport plane.

The group said it expected to raise sales and profitability by the end of next year.

Last year the group, a vital contributor to the French trade balance, delivered a record number of airliners.

Last month Airbus announced that it took a record 1,503 net orders in 2013, beating Boeing which had 1,355 orders. But it trailed behind Boeing in terms of finished airliners delivered.

Airbus said it raised its operating margin from 5.2 percent of sales in 2012 to 6.0 percent, said it expected a reasonable margin next year, rising to 7.0-8.0 percent in 2015, including costs for the new long-haul A350 aircraft.

- 25% dividend increase, shares rise -

Excluding those costs, it was aiming for a margin of 10.0 percent in 2015.

The net profit for 2013 was achieved despite a charge of 434 million euros for unexpected costs for the first examples of the A350 which is due to enter service at the end of this year.

Airbus also took a provision of 292 million euros for the costs of restructuring the Defence and Space division which comprises the former Astrium space activities, the Cassidian defence arm and the Airbus Military branch.

At the beginning of 2014, Airbus Group changed its names from EADS to reflect the dominant role played by the Airbus airliner brand.

The board recommended raising the dividend payout by 25.0 percent to 0.75 euros per share.

The figures gave a lift to Airbus shares which were showing a gain of 1.43 percent to 53.87 euros in morning trading. The overall French market was down 0.28 percent.

The other divisions also turned in good performances.

Orders taken by the Defence and Space activities rose by 28.0 percent and sales by 7.0 percent to 14.4 billion euros. Operating profit before non-recurrent items rose by 31.0 percent to 942 million euros.

Airbus Helicopters was set back by a temporary suspension of use of the EC225 helicopter, popular for work on oil rigs. This unit raised sales by 1.0 percent, but operating profit rose by 28.0 percent."

The new aircraft will begin delivery in 2019, with both the new and the leased aircraft helping replace some of the airline’s fleet.

An Airbus spokesperson couldn’t be reached for comment Thursday.

Earlier this month, Kuwait’s Parliament ordered a probe into the agreement signed in December, but there was no mention of that investigation in Wednesday’s statement."

Qatar Airways set to receive 10 Airbus A350 XWB by 2015| Gulf Times - Gulf Times,"Wed, 05 Feb 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmd1bGYtdGltZXMuY29tL3N0b3J5LzM4MDIwNC9xYXRhci1haXJ3YXlzLXNldC10by1yZWNlaXZlLTEwLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLXh3Yi1ieS0yMDE10gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ3VsZi10aW1lcy5jb20vc3RvcnkvMzgwMjA0L3FhdGFyLWFpcndheXMtc2V0LXRvLXJlY2VpdmUtMTAtYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAteHdiLWJ5LTIwMTUvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus A50 XWB carrying Qatar’s flag makes its first landing at the Hamad International Airport yesterday.

By Pratap John/Chief Business Reporter

Qatar Airways, which is the launch customer of the Airbus A350 XWB, will receive first of the fuel efficient, mid-sized wide-body airliner later this year and nine more in 2015, Group CEO Akbar al-Baker has said.

“The first A350 XWB delivery will be at the end of this year. The test programme is going absolutely perfectly, without any glitches. Airbus has been very transparent with us on the subject of its test results,” al-Baker told Gulf Times in Doha yesterday.

“Once Airbus ramps up production we will receive larger numbers of Airbus A350 a year. It will be more than one aircraft a month, starting from 2016. After which we will receive more than two aircraft a month. In 2017, we will start receiving the stretched version A350-1000, for which we are also the launch customer” al-Baker said.

The A350 XWB is a family of mid-sized wide-body airliners designed to enhance fuel, operating costs and environmental efficiencies during medium-to-long haul airline operations. Featuring the very latest in aerodynamics, design and advanced technologies, these highly efficient aircraft provide better fuel efficiency of up to 25%.

Over 70% of the A350 XWB’s weight-efficient airframe is made from advanced materials combining composites (53%), titanium and advanced aluminium alloys.

The aircraft’s innovative all-new Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) fuselage results in lower fuel burn as well as easier maintenance.

Now in its advanced flight test programme phase, the A350 XWB airliners are scheduled to enter into commercial service in Q4, 2014. Qatar Airways has ordered some 80 aircraft to date, leaning towards the larger A350-900 and A350-1000 models, which better suit its business model and passenger requirements.

Meanwhile, Qatar Airways yesterday welcomed the Airbus A350 XWB as it made its first-ever landing at the new Hamad International Airport (HIA), before departing for its next stop, the Singapore Airshow.

On the occasion, al-Baker said, “This is yet another key milestone in Qatar’s aviation progress. We have been steadily investing in our infrastructure to enable us to stay ahead of the latest developments in the global aviation sector. Hamad International Airport, which was built for advanced aircraft such as the Airbus A350 XWB, is our flagship asset and will soon be the new home of Qatar Airways and our modern fleet of aircraft, including the A350 XWB family.”

Airbus A350 XWB programme executive vice president Didier Evrard said the Middle East region would account for more than 30% of the 800 Airbus A350 XWB sold so far.

“This aircraft incorporates brand new technology and has a brand new engine in existence today. We expect the market share to remain very high,” he said.

The A350-900 will have a capacity of 300 passengers and the stretch -1000 can add another 50 passengers, he said.

Rolls Royce senior vice president (customer business) Phil Harris, Qatar Tourism Authority’s chairman Issa bin Mohamed al-Mohannadi, ambassadors Jean-Christophe Peaucelle (France), Angelikai Storz-Chakarj (Germany) and Maria Del Carmen De Labena (Spain) were among the dignitaries present.

HIA to be operational by Q2

The Hamad International Airport will be operational by the second quarter of this year, Qatar Airways CEO Akbar al-Baker has said.

Spread across an area one third of the size of the city of Doha, the HIA spans some 22sq km, and is one of the most elaborate greenfield airport projects in the world today.

Its state-of-the-art design aims to set a new global standard in commercial aviation. Upon initial opening, it will accommodate up to 24mn passengers, and up to 50mn by 2015. With its dual runway system, it will have the capacity to handle up to 360,000 aircraft annually, approximately 2.5 times more than the current airport.

The HIA’s dual runway system comprises a 4,850m eastern runway and a 4,250m western runway that are 2km apart. Designed for superior runway efficiency, it will be able to handle about 100 aircraft every hour."
New Airbus A350 debuts at Hamad International Airport (updated) - Doha News,"Wed, 05 Feb 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZG9oYW5ld3MuY28vYnJhbmQtbmV3LWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLWRlYnV0cy1hdC1oYW1hZC1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLWFpcnBvcnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With reporting from Gazanfarulla Khan

Airbus’ newest aircraft, the A350, has made its Qatar debut today with a flying display at Doha’s unopened Hamad International Airport (HIA).

Qatar Airways will be the first airline to fly the plane, which is due to carry commercial passengers toward the end of this year.

Qatar’s national airline is also the A350’s largest customer, with 80 of the aircraft on order in a mixture of two models – the 300-seater A350-900; and its larger cousin, the A350-1000. The latter model is not due to enter service until 2017, and will seat up to 350 passengers in three classes.

A350 Primer: It will be 25 percent more fuel-efficient than other aircraft of the same size, according to Airbus;

The largest of the A350s, the A350-1000, is 73.88 meters long and has a range of approximately 8,400 nautical miles, or 15,600 kilometers;

Some 70 percent of the A350 is made from advanced materials, including carbon composites (53 percent), titanium, and advanced aluminum alloys; and

Its wings are made primarily of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer. Its fuselage is made of Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastic (CFRP), which Qatar Airways says will result in lower fuel burn – and therefore, lower costs.

This makes it larger than the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which seats 254, and puts it in the same league as the national carrier’s largest A330 aircraft, which carry up to 305 passengers. Additionally, the airline’s soon-to-be-delivered first A380 will carry 517 passengers in three classes.

Journalists were given a tour of the interior of the A350 today, a test model whose interior has not been completed. They were also treated to an air display, with the A350 being put through a series of impressive maneuvers in front of a VIP crowd.

The aircraft will remain in Doha for two days so that Airbus can carry out some unspecified checks, and will return in June to test its performance during the summer heat.

Delivery ‘later this year’

Speaking to journalists at today’s event, Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker said the airline was “working very closely” with Airbus to receive its first A350 “later this year,” but declined to give a specific date.

After this first delivery, he said that the airline expected to receive nine A350s next year, followed by one new aircraft a month in 2016, and two aircraft a month in 2017.

Each A350-900 is estimated to cost around $277.7 million.

Yesterday, Al Baker visited the Airbus factory in Toulouse to inspect the first A350 to carry the Qatar Airways logo.

The livery is somewhat different to the usual grey and maroon color scheme, as it’s been painted in a “Launch Customer” design, a hybrid of Qatar Airways’ and Airbus logos and colors.

This aircraft was not flown to Doha to be displayed today, but it will be shown at the Singapore Air Show next week.

Fate of HIA

Though today’s event was held at the HIA, there is still no official word on exactly when the city’s much-delayed new airport will open its doors to customers.

The latest update was given last month, when the chairman of the Hamad International Airport (HIA) steering committee, Abdul Aziz Mohammad Al-Noaimi, said that the airport was “on track for a phased opening by mid-year 2014.”

He emphasized that the delay was not related to safety or security problems, but was in fact due to issues with contractors, adding that the airport’s premium lounges “still need some work.”

Speaking today, Al Baker told journalists that the A350 event had been “a unique glimpse into the exciting developments around the corner” for the new airport’s air traffic and ground control staff.

Airbus Group sees profits jump in 2013 - Namibian,"Thu, 27 Feb 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hbWliaWFuLmNvbS5uYS9haXJidXMtZ3JvdXAtc2Vlcy1wcm9maXRzLWp1bXAtaW4tMjAxMy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TOULOUSE – European aerospace giant Airbus Group yesterday announced a 22% year on year rise in net profit for 2013, despite one-off charges related to its new A350 wide-body aircraft.

Net profit was 1,5 billion euros (US$2,06 billion) while earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBIT) rose by 21% to 3,6 billion euros, it said in a statement.

Full year revenue was up five percent to 59,3 billion euros, driven by increased aircraft deliveries.

For 2014 the group -formerly known as EADS -said it “expects moderate return on sales growth” and “confirms its 2015 return on sales target of seven to eight percent.”

The final quarter of 2013 included a 434 million euro charge “to reflect the higher level of costs on the A350 XWB programme”, it said. The A350 XWB is a long-range, wide body plane which is slated to come into service at the end of the year.

Airbus Group added that it planned to increase production of its popular A320 single aisle planes from 42 to 46 per month from the second quarter of 2016.

Last month Airbus announced that it took a record 1 503 net orders in 2013, beating US rival Boeing which had 1 355 orders. But it trailed behind Boeing in terms of finished airliners delivered. – Nampa-AFP"
New Airbus facility boosts S'pore's aviation hub status - TODAY,"Thu, 13 Feb 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvZGF5b25saW5lLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9uZXctYWlyYnVzLWZhY2lsaXR5LWJvb3N0cy1zcG9yZXMtYXZpYXRpb24taHViLXN0YXR1c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SINGAPORE — The Republic’s standing as the leading aerospace hub in the region has been reinforced with the opening of another facility here by global aviation giant Airbus, which comes in the same week as the launch of major developments here by companies such as Pratt & Whitney and Bombardier.

The Airbus facility, which is located at Seletar Aerospace Park, is a US$20 million (S$25.3 million) joint investment with Danish aviation parts group Satair, and will act as the primary spare parts centre in Asia-Pacific for the aircraft manufacturer.

Mr Fabrice Bregier, Airbus’ President and Chief Executive, said: “The opening of this new facility here in Singapore not only further asserts Airbus’ global footprint, but also enables us to be closer to our customers and provide the most responsive support in this fastest growing region.”

Economic Development Board (EDB) Chairman Leo Yip said at the opening of the centre that it plays to Singapore’s strengths. “We are a strong proponent of free trade, we are well-positioned to provide companies access to emerging markets in this region and beyond,” he said. “So, companies like Airbus and Satair can benefit from what Singapore offers.”

Airbus currently has a helicopter maintenance and repair facility and a pilot training centre here. In the coming year, the company will add an engine overhaul and test set-up and a flight training joint venture with Singapore Airlines.

Mr Mikkel Bardram, the Chief Executive of Satair, which is now wholly-owned by Airbus after the Danish company merged with an Airbus unit earlier this year, said the decision to expand in Singapore was not a difficult one to make.

“Both business units were running out of space, both units have great ambitions for growth in this region and also, both business units want to leverage on the great knowledge of the Singapore workforce,” he said. “So, the decision was obvious: Expand our footprint in Singapore.”

The centre has 120 employees, with room to expand to 200, with most in skilled positions in engineering, procurement, logistics and management.

Credit Suisse economist Michael Wan said jobs that the aviation industry is bringing in are generally high-value-add, high-skilled jobs that the Singapore Government wants to create more of. “The productivity levels are quite high for aviation maintenance and manufacturing jobs,” he said, “and as they are high-skilled and generally well-paid positions, the expansion of the industry here is helping the economy.”

More than 100 companies have set up base in Singapore’s aerospace industry, achieving a record output of more than S$8.7 billion last year, according to statistics by the EDB.

But while the industry has expanded rapidly, it still has room to grow, said Mr Yip. “Over the next many years, we will expand our airport … and we will also create new industrial areas to support air freight and MRO (maintenance, repair, and operations).

“I think these enhance air infrastructure and enable Singapore to provide better supply chain and capacity support to the industry and strengthen our position in the Asia-Pacific region.”"
UCT helps SA take giant leap into the space age - University of Cape Town News,"Mon, 17 Feb 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHA6Ly93d3cubmV3cy51Y3QuYWMuemEvYXJ0aWNsZS8tMjAxNC0wMi0xNy11Y3QtaGVscHMtc2EtdGFrZS1naWFudC1sZWFwLWludG8tdGhlLXNwYWNlLWFnZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A multi-million-rand agreement between the University of Cape Town Faculty of Engineering & the Built Environment and top European space technology company Airbus Defence and Space is set to propel SA into the high-tech world of international space technology.

Fifteen years ago, a young engineering student had a brainwave. Today his idea has developed into a sophisticated software tool that has attracted the attention of the top technology companies around the world, resulting in a massive deal with Airbus.

""Many years ago I had a moment of insight and vision into the future. I realised this sort of technology would come into use. It was rudimentary back then; but I decided to pursue it, and it paid off massively,"" says Arnaud Malan, Associate Professor in Mechanical Engineering in UCT's Faculty of Engineering & the Built Environment (EBE).

Professor Malan and two PhD students will now be working with Airbus Defence and Space, formerly known as Astrium, in a new R2.5 million research agreement set to put South Africa on the strategic international space technology map.

The agreement has profound implications for South Africa - in both the short and the long term - impacting on the economy, business and science; with Airbus investing in the development of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software tool called Elemental, for ground-breaking use in the modelling and design of space applications - such as rockets and satellites.

""This is a huge, strategic moment for South Africa,"" explains Professor Malan. ""Space industry is the epitome of hi-tech."" The software can be used to model, in 3D, all kinds of technological applications, for future space applications and commercial use. The software will be licensed and will generate significant income from annual licensing fees, which is part of its economic benefit.

Professor Francis Petersen, Dean of EBE, says that this new strategic project between Airbus and the Department of Mechanical Engineering is a great honour for the university, and will strengthen its efforts in this area. ""We are delighted that Airbus, Europe's number-one space technology company, has identified the Faculty of Engineering & the Built Environment as a strong research partner in their overall strategy,"" he says.

Professor Malan says Elemental is a giant leap for technology. It uses mathematical models and equations in the field of CFD - enabling scientists to study the dynamics of fluid flow through a computer model, offering accurate predictions and unprecedented insights. It is a sophisticated analysis technique offering multiple predictions. ""It can answer 'what if' questions very quickly. You give it variables, it gives you outcomes.""

The commercial CFD software market, currently generating over R5.6 billion annually worldwide, is one of the fastest-growing fields in engineering today. ""Elemental is all South African,"" says Professor Malan. It is different from similar CFD code, as it was designed from the outset to allow for rapid development of the complex multi-physics devices that today pose lucrative opportunities for industry. ""The best commercial software in the world has been found to be limited. That is why they're looking to us,"" explains Professor Malan regarding the Airbus-UCT initiative.

The technology has already resulted in two UCT spin-out companies - Numerus Technologies (Pty) Ltd and Elemental IP Holdings (Pty) Ltd - aiming to allow South Africa to enter into lucrative and modern technological markets, ranging from software licensing and the development of internationally competitive products and devices, to the cost-effective provision of electricity."

The daily shuttle will seat 40 passengers in a 2-2- layout, with Qatar boasting the seats ""have one of the highest specifications for business class travel of any airline.""

Each passenger gets in-seat entertainment plus AC laptop power, of course, with inflight mobile phone access – although there's no mention of satellite Internet.

The seats themselves recline to a fully-flat bed.

In all, Qatar suggests its A319 ""is sure to reflect that of a VIP jet experience for those traveling between London and Doha.""

Travellers also enjoy access to Qatar's Premium lounge in London Heathrow’s T4 (below) plus the Premium Terminal in Doha.

Qatar's description of the Terminal 4 lounge as more closely resembling ""a boutique hotel or private member's club rather than a conventional airport lounge"" fits in perfectly with the A319's VIP vibe.

African growth providing lift for global helicopter group’s SA unit - Creamer Media's Engineering News,"Fri, 14 Feb 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZ2luZWVyaW5nbmV3cy5jby56YS9wcmludC12ZXJzaW9uL2FmcmljYW4tZ3Jvd3RoLXByb3ZpZGluZy1saWZ0LWZvci1nbG9iYWwtaGVsaWNvcHRlci1ncm91cHMtc2EtdW5pdC0yMDE0LTAyLTE00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Over the past few years, Kenya has emerged as the biggest single market for Eurocopter Southern Africa Limited (ESAL) as the aviation sector in that country has boomed and the Nairobi government has sought to strengthen its law enforcement, security and conservation agencies. ESAL receives new helicopters from its parent company in Europe, Airbus Helicopters (previously Eurocopter), and paints them, modifies them and equips them as required by customers. It also undertakes maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) of Airbus Helicopter models.

“Originally, our activities were mostly . . . in South Africa,” explains new ESAL CEO Arnaud Montalvo. “In the past seven to eight years, we expanded outside South Africa, mainly for law enforcement. But, in Kenya, it is not only law enforcement – it is also other government agencies: Kenya Wildlife, Kenya Forestry, Kenya Pipeline, plus civilian operators, mostly in the utility sector.” Of the seven aircraft delivered by ESAL last year, five were to customers in Kenya. Of the seven orders that ESAL won last year, four were from Kenya.

“We are very active in Kenya,” he reports. “The Kenya Police have growing needs and have issued a tender for a twin-engined helicopter. We’re confident there will be more tenders in future. We’ll also be setting up a permanent base in Kenya, which will be part of ESAL, at Nairobi Wilson Airport. Wilson is Nairobi’s general aviation airport and police aviation base. It’s now probably the busiest airport in Africa in terms of aircraft movements.”

While the aviation sector in South Africa shrank following the Great Recession, activity in other African countries increased, especially in the law enforcement sector. “We have introduced two new platforms – the EC145, with one delivered to the Namibian Police, and the EC135, to the Lesotho Defence Force. We expect to sell more helicopters to Lesotho in the medium term. They still have ageing aircraft to replace,” he noted. “They are using an EC135 to replace an [MBB – later Eurocopter –] BO 105.”

In the civilian sector, Airbus Helicopters has enjoyed success with the offshore oil and gas sector in Angola, as well as with other civil operators in that country. ESAL is now looking at the emerging oil and gas support sector along the East Coast of Africa, stretching from Mozambique to Kenya.

“South Africa should get some of the benefits of this and it should help the local aviation sector to recover, especially the utility sector, which has been hard-hit by the crisis since 2007,” he says. “Right now, we’re still at the very beginning of these oil and gas activities, so their scale is not clear. Initial operations involve light twin-engined and medium twin-engined helicopters.”

The company is continuing to expand its support capabilities and seeking to introduce new products into its region (southern and east Africa and the Indian Ocean islands), particularly larger helicopters. Already established and operating since 2012 is the Super Puma simulator.

The Super Puma is frequently used to support the offshore oil and gas industry worldwide, but three have been lost in the North Sea over the past four years. “The latest accident is still under investigation, but the fleet has resumed operations worldwide,” points out Montalvo. “Airbus Helicopters has developed a technical solution to the problem and this is currently being implemented.”

ESAL had a turnover of about R500-million last year. The company employs 85 people, of whom 25 are engineers. It also has training facilities for mechanics, technicians and (for helicopters up to and including the EC145) pilots, plus the Super Puma simulator. It also undertakes MRO on Airbus Helicopters for customers from outside its region, such as the Middle East.

With the renaming of the parent group as Airbus Helicopter, ESAL will follow suit during the course of this year. Airbus Helicopter has some 30 entities around the world and the new name will be phased in, with the North American subsidiaries being the first of these to adopt it. ESAL will be Airbus Helicopter Southern Africa by the start of Africa Aerospace and Defence 2014, in September."
