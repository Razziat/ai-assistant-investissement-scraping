Airbus again becomes the world's leading aircraft manufacturer - The Conversation,"Fri, 17 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29udmVyc2F0aW9uLmNvbS9haXJidXMtYWdhaW4tYmVjb21lcy10aGUtd29ybGRzLWxlYWRpbmctYWlyY3JhZnQtbWFudWZhY3R1cmVyLTEyOTU5NdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After eight years of Boeing leadership, Airbus has again become the world’s leading aircraft manufacturer. The European group surpassed 1,000 aircraft orders in 2019 and broke its record of aircraft delivered with 863 units. By comparison, Boeing delivered a mere 345.

The A320, launched in 1988, became the bestselling aircraft of all time, outnumbering the Boeing 737, which is 20 years older. In addition, from January 2020, Boeing suspended production of the 737 Max, once a bestseller but currently banned from flying because of two crashes in October 2018 and March 2019.

According to Airbus commercial director Christian Scherrer, Boeing’s difficulties are not benefiting its European competitor – the firm’s production capacity does not allow it to deliver new customers before four years. However, Airbus continues to accumulate orders, including from customers once loyal to Boeing. In addition, it is likely that the 10% tax on aircraft imports into the United States is a direct result of Boeing’s troubles.

Suppliers General Electric and Safran have been heavily affected by the 737 Max crisis, an aircraft exclusively equipped with the LEAP engine that they co-developed. The joint subsidiary CFM International has negotiated with Airbus to increase the percentage of A320neo aircraft that use this engine to compensate for the losses associated with the 737 Max. Hundreds of European suppliers that also work for Airbus are also financially affected.

Relative successes for Airbus

Although 2019 was marked by the end of the A380, considered a commercial flop, Airbus has exceeded the symbolic mark of the 20,000 planes sold since its creation. The company also won many battles against Boeing last year. The A320, A320neo, A321, A321neo and A350 models are particularly popular with airlines. The A321 XLR is part of a sustainable development strategy: it consumes a third less of kerosene, which gives it a much greater radius of action and reduces costs per passenger.

United Airlines ordered 50 ultra-long-haul Airbus A321 XLRs for about $6 billion. These aircraft are intended to replace Boeing 757s and are expected to enter service in 2024. Thanks to this innovative plane, which as presented by Airbus at the 2019 Paris Air Show, the company will be able to reduce significantly its carbon footprint and benefit from the long-range capabilities to add new destinations.

Cebu Pacific Air, the leading airline in the Philippines, confirmed an order for five A320neo and ten A321 XLR on December 19, after having finalized another of 16 A330neo, which makes a total of 21 aircraft for approximately $6.8 billion in 2019. This is nothing compared to the record order from one of the fastest-growing airlines in the world: the low-cost Indian company IndiGo. In October, it ordered 300 A320s, including several A321 XLRs, worth $33 billion. When delivered, IndiGo will reach a total of 730 A320s, making it the largest customer for this model.

Airbus has also been selected by Quantas to operate the longest flight in the world: 20 hours to cover the 10,500 miles (17,000 km) between London and Sydney. In December 2019, after launching a tender to the two manufacturers, Quantas announced that it was choosing the A350-1000 rather than the Boeing 777X.

Airbus’s situation seems solid and the future looks bright. The group may hire between 1,500 and 2,000 people in France, and potentially 5,000 worldwide. The group has exceeded US$100 billion in market valuation, Airbus shares rose 59% in 2019](https://www.lefigaro.fr/conjoncture/ces-entreprises-qui-font-flamber-le-cac-40-20191229) and the company begins 2020 at the top of the French stock market index CAC40.

Still, Airbus’s leadership position remains fragile. If the symbolic threshold of 1,000 aircraft ordered may seem satisfactory, it is already the sixth time that the group has exceeded it, and this remains well below the record set in 2013 with 1,503 orders. Production is struggling to keep up with sales, as the most popular models are victims of their success. Some current deliveries are late and the increase from 60 to 63 aircraft per month between 2019 and 2021 will not significantly improve things.

A multidimensional crisis for Boeing

Boeing is currently going through the worst crisis since it was founded in 1916. This crisis is deep, lasting and multidimensional. Above all, it is a reputational crisis, the group having entered a spiral of failures and an era of suspicion. Multiple charges of negligence and willful intention to deceive the authorities could be confirmed by internal documents transmitted to the US Congress in December 2019.

After two 737 Max crashes that left 346 dead, many passengers have completely lost confidence in the plane: 40% of travelers are ready to pay more or take less practical flights to avoid it. New theories question the safety of other software-independent parts of the aircraft.

The crisis is also technological, Boeing has had significant difficulties finding reliable solutions to the various dysfunctions of its planes. This in turn led to an industrial crisis: after severely slowing down the production of the 737 Max, Boeing stopped it completely in January 2020. Although 12,000 people work directly in the production of the 737 Max, Boeing does not plan to lay off workers for the time being. The consequences may be particularly difficult for the suppliers most dependent on Boeing to bear.

Boeing also faces a legal crisis: lengthy and costly lawsuits from victims and airlines could well further tarnish the company’s image. The financial consequences are already considerable with 10 billion euros of cash provisioned to deal with the direct and indirect consequences of the crashes. If the manufacturer had US$20 billion in funds a few months ago, it would consider increasing its debt by at least US$5 billion to meet expected costs in the first half of 2020.

To cope with the managerial dimension of the crisis, a financial expert, David Calhoun, was chosen to succeed the engineer Dennis Muilenburg as CEO of Boeing from January 13, 2020. Muilenburg was severely criticized for his handling of the crisis and had to resign. Among other things, he was accused of not respecting the independence of air-transport regulatory authorities and not reacting quickly enough.

Major geopolitical issues

Naturally, Boeing’s difficulties and Airbus’ success are not to the liking of US president Donald Trump, who saw a large part of the GDP of the United States evaporate. The competition between the two has fueled the trade war between EU and US, which in October 2019 decided to apply a 10% tax on imports of European aircraft. Airbus management denounces an unfair decision directly linked to the current fragility of the Boeing group.

Airbus and Boeing must prepare for the entry into the market of a strong competitor. In 2017, the Chinese group Comac (Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China) and the Russian consortium UAC (United Aircraft Corporation) created the joint venture CRAIC (China-Russia Commercial Aircraft International Corporation) in order to launch aircraft they claim are as efficient as those of Airbus and Boeing, but less expensive.

For presidents Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin, this alliance is part of a major strategic move toward Sino-Russian collaboration. The friendship between the two presidents has led them to join forces against the United States and the trade policy of the government of Donald Trump. The CR929 will be a direct competitor to the A350 and the B787. With a budget of US$20 billion, this aircraft is scheduled to enter service between 2025 and 2028."
Airbus to Pay $4 Billion to Settle Corruption Inquiry - The New York Times,"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjAvMDEvMzEvYnVzaW5lc3MvYWlyYnVzLWNvcnJ1cHRpb24tc2V0dGxlbWVudC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Airbus will pay $4 billion in fines to settle a lengthy global corruption investigation, a French court announced Friday, removing a legal cloud over the world’s largest plane maker as it seeks to keep ahead of its rival Boeing after the grounding of Boeing’s 737 Max plane.

The settlement with the authorities in France, Britain and the United States closes four years of investigations into accusations that Airbus, between 2004 and 2016, used intermediaries to bribe public officials in numerous countries to buy its planes and satellites. The episode had tarnished the company’s reputation and forced it to make sweeping changes to top management.

It also allows Airbus to avoid criminal charges that, if proved, could have crippled its business by prohibiting the company from seeking public contracts in Europe and the United States. Airbus will be subject to three years of “light compliance monitoring” in France, the nation’s anticorruption agency said Friday.

“In reaching this agreement today, we are helping Airbus turn the page,” said the French prosecutor, Jean-Francois Bohnert. The company “can now serenely look to its economic future.”"
Is autonomy the future of aerial mobility? - Airbus,"Thu, 16 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIwLTAxLWlzLWF1dG9ub215LXRoZS1mdXR1cmUtb2YtYWVyaWFsLW1vYmlsaXR50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Advanced computer vision and machine learning—from sensors to cameras—are rapidly enabling major advances in the development of autonomous technologies in aircraft. In the years to come, autonomy could help the aviation industry to mitigate pilot shortages and safely meet the growing demand in commercial air travel.

Only ten years ago, the idea of autonomous vehicles on our roads seemed like a distant reality. And yet, rapid advances in machine learning—as well as sensor, camera and mapping technology—have been making great progress. But autonomous technologies are not only applicable to cars: they are also influencing the development of more autonomous flight.

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), air traffic is expected to double by 2037. This will necessitate approximately +37,000 new passenger and freight aircraft—and more than half a million new pilots to fly them. Given this expected increase in air travel, other solutions will be required to support pilots in aircraft operations.

The key challenge for self-piloting capabilities is how the system reacts to unforeseen events. That’s the big jump from automated to autonomous.

- Arne Stoschek, Wayfinder Project Executive, Acubed

And autonomous aircraft technologies are proving promising in this respect. In fact, technology has already reduced the number of pilots in the cockpit from three to two, and autopilot is routinely used in many phases of flight today. In addition to addressing pilot shortages, autonomous technologies also have the potential to improve air traffic management, enhance sustainability performance and further improve aircraft safety while ensuring today’s unprecedented safety levels are maintained.

From automated to autonomous

At Airbus, the development of autonomous technologies is moving forward rapidly. The Autonomous Taxi, Take-Off and Landing (ATTOL) demonstrator project is one example. This Airbus UpNext project aims to develop and test computer vision algorithms that will enable an Airbus aircraft to taxi, take off and land by itself—without the help of the airport or satellite systems. Recently, an Airbus flight test crew performed the first-ever fully automatic vision-based take-off, using an Airbus Family test aircraft. Vision-based taxi and landing sequences are expected to take place sometime in 2020.

“Many aircraft are already able to land automatically,” Sébastien Giuliano, ATTOL Project Lead, says. “But they’re reliant on external infrastructure like Instrument Landing System (ILS) or GPS signals. ATTOL aims to make this possible solely using on-board technology to maximise efficiency and to reduce infrastructure cost.”

Sébastien says the ATTOL team is working closely with the Wayfinder team to advance autonomous flight technology at Airbus. The Wayfinder project—based at Acubed, Airbus’ innovation hub in Silicon Valley—aims to develop scalable, certifiable autonomy systems for aircraft, ranging from small urban air vehicles to large commercial aircraft.

Based on computer vision and machine learning, the Wayfinder software enables an aircraft to detect its surrounding environment and calculate how best to navigate within it. Much like an autonomous car, it uses sensors such as cameras, radar, LiDAR—a laser-based detection method—and powerful on-board computers.

“The key challenge for self-piloting capabilities is how the system reacts to unforeseen events,” Wayfinder Project Executive Arne Stoschek explains. “That’s the big jump from automated to autonomous.”

A tailored combination of human & machine interaction

In addition to the technical challenges, autonomous flight technologies must also gain public acceptance. Simply put, passengers are used to having two pilots on the flight deck. But Arne believes this can change over time: “Elevators used to have operators, for example, but that concept would seem strange today. With our track record of safety, Airbus is ideally positioned to drive this change.”

For Airbus, autonomous flight is not an all-or-nothing proposition: it is a tailored combination of human and machine that will evolve over time. Systems are focused on managing the aircraft while the pilot remains at the heart of the operation to take decisions, being presented with all the necessary information and given time to analyse it. This is a purpose for which the sense-and-avoid image processing technology behind ATTOL and Wayfinder is essential."
Airbus and Boeing Report December and Full-Year 2019 Commercial Aircraft Orders and Deliveries - Defense & Security Monitor,"Tue, 21 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL2RzbS5mb3JlY2FzdGludGVybmF0aW9uYWwuY29tLzIwMjAvMDEvMjEvYWlyYnVzLWFuZC1ib2VpbmctcmVwb3J0LWRlY2VtYmVyLWFuZC1mdWxsLXllYXItMjAxOS1jb21tZXJjaWFsLWFpcmNyYWZ0LW9yZGVycy1hbmQtZGVsaXZlcmllcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Celebrates Strong Year as 737 MAX Weighs Heavily on Boeing’s Performance

by J. Kasper Oestergaard, European Correspondent, Forecast International.

Boeing and Airbus delivered 35 and 138 commercial jets in December 2019, compared to 102 and 127 deliveries, respectively, in the same month last year. Boeing’s deliveries took a severe hit in 2019 following two 737 MAX crashes and the subsequent deliveries halt and grounding of the fleet. Boeing decided last March to suspend all deliveries of 737 MAX jets. The crashes were caused by the aircraft’s Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), which suddenly activated in response to erroneous angle of attack information. For the full year 2019, Boeing delivered 380 aircraft, while Airbus set a new all-time annual record, handing over 863 jets. Boeing had retained a deliveries lead over Airbus since 2012. Airbus did, however, come in slightly below its full-year target, announced in February 2019, of 880 to 890 commercial aircraft deliveries. Boeing had originally set a target of 810-815 deliveries for 2019. In 2018, Boeing delivered 806 jets (763 in 2017), with Airbus handing over 800 (718 in 2017).

In December, Boeing delivered six 737NGs. On December 16, Boeing announced its decision to temporarily suspend 737 production from January 2020. Prior to this, Boeing had been producing 737 MAX jets at a reduced rate of 42 aircraft per month and thereby built up an inventory of aircraft ready to be shipped. Producing the 737 MAX at a reduced rate allowed the company to prioritize additional resources to focus on returning the 737 MAX to flight. However, with approximately 400 aircraft now in storage and no return-to-service date set, the company made the call to stop building more inventory, thereby preserving cash. Boeing announced that affected employees will continue 737-related work or be temporarily assigned to other programs. In the meantime, test flights and software changes continue. Boeing has carried out more than 900 test flights with new MCAS software, for a total of 1,700 flight hours. On January 10, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration announced that it remains focused on following a thorough process for returning the 737 MAX to service. The FAA continues to work with other international aviation safety regulators to review the proposed changes to the aircraft. The FAA made it clear that its first priority is safety and that no timeframe for when the work will be completed has been set.

Also on January 10, Spirit AeroSystems, the world’s largest aerostructures manufacturer, announced that it will lay off 2,800 employees at its Wichita, Kansas, facility because of the 737 MAX production suspension and ongoing uncertainty. Spirit AeroSystems is a major supplier on the 737 MAX program, accounting for 70 percent of the airplane’s structure, including the entire fuselage and the thrust reversers, engine pylons, and wing components. The 737 MAX represents more than 50 percent of the company’s annual revenue.

“Our goal is to support Boeing and a safe return to service of the MAX,” said Tom Gentile, Spirit AeroSystems president and CEO. “We continue to work with Boeing to develop a new production schedule for 2020 with an eye toward minimizing disruption, maintaining the stability of our production capabilities, and best positioning Spirit for the future. When production levels increase sufficiently in the future, we look forward to recalling employees impacted by today’s announcement.”

To date, in total, Boeing has delivered 387 737 MAX jets, of which 256 were delivered in 2018, up from 74 in 2017. In December, Boeing also delivered three 767s, five 777s, and 21 787s – a new monthly Dreamliner production record. Boeing recently raised the monthly Dreamliner production rate to 14 aircraft and handed over 158 787s in 2019 in total – a new annual record. The company delivered 145 787s in 2018, up from 136 in 2017.

In December, Airbus delivered seven A220s, 105 A320s (3 CEO / 102 NEO – a new company record), eight A330s, 16 A350s (a new company record), and two A380s. Airbus recently increased the official A320 production rate to 60 aircraft per month and is targeting an additional raise to 63 jets per month from 2021. For the full year 2019, Airbus handed over 642 A320 family aircraft, of which 551 were A320neos. This compares to a total of 386 A320neo family aircraft delivered in 2018, up from 181 and 68 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. In October 2019, Airbus marked its 1,000th A320neo family aircraft delivery. Airbus delivered a record 112 A350s in 2019, up from 93 and 78 in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Airbus recently increased the monthly A350 production rate to 10. Airbus is considering a further increase to 13 A350s per month, but a date has yet to be announced.

Turning to the orders race, Boeing had a very quiet month, booking just three gross orders but also receiving six cancellations, resulting in minus three net new orders. Orders were for a 737 MAX and two 787 Dreamliners. For the full year 2019, Boeing accumulated 243 gross orders (330 cancellations => -87 net new orders). For the full year 2018, Boeing booked 893 net new orders (1,008 gross orders).

In December, Airbus had another strong month and booked 191 gross orders but also received 141 cancellations, for a net of 50. The largest December bookings were an Air France order for 60 A220-300s, a United Airlines A321neo order for 50 A321XLRs, and an order from an undisclosed customer for 40 A330-900 widebody jets. For the full year 2019, Airbus landed 1,131 gross orders (363 cancellations => net of 768), thereby retaking the orders crown from Boeing. Of the 363 cancellations, 31 were due to Emirates’ decision to reduce its A380 order book. This subsequently forced Airbus to announce that it will cease A380 production in 2021. In November 2019, Emirates decided to cancel an additional 39 A380 orders, reducing Airbus’ total A380 backlog to just 11 aircraft. In 2018, Airbus booked a total of 747 net new orders (831 gross orders), thereby losing the 2018 orders race as Boeing had accumulated 893 net new orders. Airbus had retained an orders lead over its rival every year since 2012.

At year-end 2019, Airbus’ backlog was 7,482 jets, of which 6,563, or 88 percent, were A220 and A320ceo/neo family narrowbodies. The company’s all-time backlog record high of 7,577 jets was set in December 2018. By the end of December 2019, Boeing’s backlog (total unfilled orders before ASC 606 adjustment) was 5,625 aircraft, of which 4,585, or 82 percent, were 737 NG/MAX narrowbody jets. Boeing’s all-time backlog high of 5,964 aircraft was set in August 2018. The number of Airbus aircraft to be built and delivered represents 9.4 years of shipments at the 2018 production level. In comparison, Boeing’s backlog would “only” last 7.0 years. For the full year 2019, Boeing’s book-to-bill ratio, calculated as net new orders divided by deliveries, is negative, as cancellations outpaced orders. Airbus’ book-to-bill ratio is 0.89. In 2018, Boeing boasted a book-to-bill ratio of 1.11, with Airbus at 0.93.

2020 Forecast

Forecast International’s Platinum Forecast System® is a breakthrough in forecasting technology. Among many other features, Platinum provides 15-year production forecasts. The author has used the Platinum Forecast System to retrieve the latest delivery forecasts and, for 2020, Forecast International’s analysts expect Boeing and Airbus to deliver 585 and 931 large commercial jets, respectively. Boeing’s 2020 total is very difficult to forecast given the 737 MAX uncertainty, and it may be revised significantly during 2020.

On January 29, in connection with the release of its 2019 earnings report, we can expect Boeing to provide some form of guidance for 2020. However, the 737 MAX uncertainty means that management will likely be cautious and avoid providing an aircraft delivery target for the year. On February 13, Airbus will report 2019 earnings and provide a target for 2020 commercial aircraft deliveries.

Note: Boeing 777-300ER orders include one 777-200LR. The 777-300ER backlog includes two 777-200LRs.

Airbus vs Boeing: Which comes out on top and what does the future hold? - Aerospace Technology,"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm9zcGFjZS10ZWNobm9sb2d5LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9haXJidXMtdnMtYm9laW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The beginnings

Boeing forayed into commercial aviation by launching its first aircraft, the B&W Seaplane, in 1916. The company went on to develop several small passenger and military aircraft in the two decades that followed, becoming a frontrunner in all-metal aircraft construction.

Boeing introduced its first commercial jetliner, the 707, in 1958. The launch of 747 long-range airliner with much larger seating capacity than other commercial aircraft in 1970 further strengthened Boeing’s position in commercial aviation.

Rival Airbus had a modest beginning with the launch of the A300B, which is based on the A300 wide-body jetliner. Airbus received its first order for the A300B from Air France in 1970.

Airbus didn’t become a significant competitor to Boeing until the 1990s when it started launching several competing products such as the A330 and the A340.

Market share – Airbus’ gain, Boeing’s loss

The commercial aircraft market, which is a major revenue driver for aerospace companies, is fully dominated by Boeing and Airbus, which together hold 99% market share.



Airbus has, however, slowly eaten into Boeing’s pie of the large commercial aircraft market by scaling-up quickly in a booming aviation market.

Boeing has delivered more than 10,000 of its bestselling 737 family since its launch in 1968, while the Airbus A320, which hit the market two decades later in 1988, saw more than 8,000 units sold by 2018.

Boeing sold its 8,000th 737 aircraft in 2014, 46 years after its launch – a feat that Airbus achieved in just 30 years.

“Although Airbus didn’t become a significant competitor until the 1990s, it has slowly eaten into Boeing’s pie of the large commercial aircraft market.”

Airbus also dominates the civilian helicopter segment with a market share of 54%. While Boeing has no offerings in the civilian helicopter segment, it’s a market leader in the military attack and transport helicopter segments.

Airbus vs Boeing: which has a better geographic diversification?

Airbus’ revenues are better diversified and are from markets that have high growth potential such as the Asia Pacific, especially China. The company earns more revenue from Asia Pacific (36.6%) than Europe (27.9%) and the two regions together contribute approximately 65% to its gross revenue.

Although Boeing too earns a similar chunk of its revenues (70%) from just two geographic areas namely the US (44.2%) and the Asia Pacific (25.6%), its revenues are more concentrated in the US, unlike Airbus, which has a better diversification. Airbus also earns higher revenue from the Asia Pacific, which Boeing too recognises to be a crucial market for its future growth.

Leveraging state benefits – reflection in the geographic concentration of revenues

While the quick growth of Airbus can be attributed partly to the boom in commercial aviation, the feat wouldn’t have been possible without state benefits, which the US claims are unfair.

The geographical distribution of revenues of the two companies is evidence of just how much Airbus benefits from state support.

Boeing’s revenues are concentrated in North America, whereas Airbus is benefitted by European state support.

North America has been dominated by Boeing for a long time, with the majority of its revenues coming from the US (44.2%) alone, whereas its counterpart earns just 17.5% of revenues from North America.

Europe to Airbus is what the US is to Boeing. European revenue contribution for Airbus (27.9%) is more than double compared to Boeing (12.8%).

Financial performance: Airbus vs Boeing

Airbus has been struggling to grow its revenues in the last five years, having registered a CAGR of 0.97% since 2014 compared to its rival Boeing, whose revenues grew almost three times faster, at 2.74%, over the same period.

Boeing’s growth was also not at the cost of margins, as witnessed by its 50% higher operating margins (11.85% in 2018) compared to Airbus (7.92%).

Revenue diversification – Boeing has lesser risk

Airbus is more dependent on civilian aircraft for its revenues, with its commercial and helicopters (majorly civilian) segments together contributing a majority share of more than 80% of its revenues, whereas Boeing earns just 60% from the commercial aircraft category. In addition, Boeing doesn’t offer civilian helicopters.

This partly explains why Boeing is better placed to absorb any potential financial shocks of multiple grounding incidents that may affect sales.

“Boeing has better diversified segments as well as earns higher margins than Airbus.”

Reliability – is Boeing losing out to Airbus in its biggest segment?

Incidents such as grounding due to serious technical issues could mar the reputation and sales of commercial aircraft manufacturers.

Airbus planes have suffered no major grounding issues apart from a temporary grounding of 14 Airbus A320 Neo aircraft in India due to P&W engine woes in 2018.

Boeing has had to deal with two major groundings. Its entire global fleet of 737 Max aircraft was grounded in March 2019, following two fatal aircraft crashes. The company had an order book of 4,636 units worth $600bn of the 737 Max family at the time of the grounding and continues to face order cancellations from several airlines.

Earlier in January 2013, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner fleet was also grounded due to issues in onboard lithium-ion batteries. The grounding, however, didn’t cause a significant impact on the 787 orders and deliveries as the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allowed US carriers to operate Dreamliners after making the required changes to battery systems in April 2013.

“Boeing continues to face order cancellations for its 737 Max family, whose order book at the time of grounding was worth $600bn.”

State support leading to trade wars – who plays fairer?

A look at Boeing’s legacy indicates clear benefits from a strong state, while Airbus is no different.

The roots of Airbus, in fact, lie in state interests and the company continues to be backed by EU nations, with the governments of Germany, France, and Spain currently holding 11.04%, 11.06%, and 4.16% stakes, respectively.

Competition has, eventually, resulted in legal fights by the governments to safeguard their respective business interests.

The US Government filed a case with the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2006, against the EU subsidies worth $22bn to Airbus for new product development. The WTO’s verdict in 2010 confirmed that Airbus received $18bn of illegal subsidies, including $15bn of launch aid from the three governments that have interests in Airbus.

The EU filed a counter case against the US alleging $23bn indirect subsidies to Boeing. In March 2011, the WTO ruled out a major part of the allegation stating that 80% of the subsidies were found to be fair.

The EU filed another case in 2012, alleging that the US failed to abide by the findings against it. A compliance panel set up by the WTO to assess the appeal rejected 28 of the 29 claims made by the EU, in June 2017.

The US has retaliated by requesting the WTO to impose approximately $11bn in annual countermeasures to offset the damaging trade effects of the subsidies enjoyed by Airbus.

Product mix: Airbus vs Boeing

Boeing and Airbus offer products in many common categories, including commercial aircraft, unmanned aircraft, military aircraft, and space systems.

Most of the commercial aircraft models being manufactured by the two companies are close competitors, the most popular ones being the Boeing 737 family and the Airbus A320 family of aircraft.

Airbus’ product portfolio is differentiated by civilian helicopters that include models ranging from light single-engine to twin-turbine heavy-lift rotorcraft, where Boeing has no presence.

The below table compares the product portfolio of the two companies:

Product Portfolio: Boeing vs Airbus

Type Boeing Airbus Commercial Aircraft Yes Yes Commercial Helicopters No Yes Military Helicopters Yes Yes Military Aircraft (Fighter Jets & Transport Aircraft) Yes Yes Unmanned Aircraft Yes Yes AEW&C Aircraft Yes No Satellites Yes Yes Space Launch Systems Yes Yes Silo-based Ballistic Missile Systems Yes No

Airbus loses out to Boeing in the missiles systems category, where it has no direct offerings, although it holds a 37.5% stake in European missiles developer and manufacturer MBDA. Boeing also has a competitive edge in the ballistic missiles space since MBDA doesn’t produce them.

“Airbus loses out to Boeing in the missiles systems category.”

Innovation – Airbus vs Boeing



Airbus has been trying to match its research and development expenditure with that of Boeing, despite its relatively lower business scale. During four of the last five years, Airbus has spent more dollars on research and development compared to Boeing.



Both the companies are eying the potential mass markets in different applications.

Airbus is targeting the urban commutation business with its online helicopter booking platform Voom that connects travellers with air taxi companies, laying the foundation for urban air mobility powered by e-VTOL vehicles.

Boeing, on the other hand, aims to capture the on-demand air deliveries market and has already developed a demonstrator cargo air vehicle named HorizonX.

Airbus is counting more on start-ups, broad-basing its innovation efforts, by setting-up innovation centres housing start-ups and offering technical and funding support to start-ups in select areas such as autonomy, electrification, and security.

Both the companies have sensed the potential threat of competition emerging from countries like China and have established innovation centres in China. While the Airbus China Innovation Centre focuses largely on the company’s global factories, Boeing’s Chinese innovation centre is focused on innovating and improving exclusive access for the Asia Pacific market. China contributes more revenue than the rest of the Asia Pacific for Boeing.

“Airbus spends as much as Boeing in R&D, despite its smaller scale of operations compared to the latter.”

Military aviation – who wins the game?



Boeing offers unique and advanced military rotorcraft products such as the AH-64 Apache, CH-47F, V-22 Osprey, and AH-6.

Although Airbus’ deck in this space is not empty, six of the eight military rotorcraft it offers are based on civilian helicopter platforms. The other two platforms Tiger attack helicopter and NH-90 multi-role helicopter are comparable to Boeing’s offerings in their respective categories but have lower sales than its rival. Tiger and NH-90 mainly serve the EU countries, where Boeing too competes, but have zero sales in North America.

Airbus also has just a single product in the fighter aircraft segment unlike Boeing, which has advanced fighter jets such as F-15 Strike Eagle and F/A-18 Hornet that are offered in multiple variants. The only fighter jet Airbus offers is the Eurofighter Typhoon, which has no variants to suit customer-specific mission requirements.

Boeing, thus, has a clear competitive edge in military products over Airbus, which misses out fully on missiles and partly on helicopters and fighter jet varieties.

“Boeing has a clear competitive edge in military products, over Airbus.”

What the future holds

The immediate future for Boeing and Airbus looks equally uncertain as both have their own set of challenges to overcome.

For Boeing, the immediate threat is further crashes or failures of the 737 Max, which can result in order cancellations and litigations that could affect revenue and market share in a crucial business segment.

For Airbus, the looming threat is the $11bn annual countermeasures proposed by the US for alleged unfair trading, which, if imposed, would cause severe financial pressure and greatly reduce its competitive position.

If both emerge from scandals safely, Airbus would continue to compete with Boeing’s commercial aircraft as well as Space businesses. Defence and Security businesses, where Airbus has been weaker, can partially offset the effect for Boeing, whereas Airbus will have no similar offset.

Further, the success or otherwise in highly scalable new businesses such as urban air commutation and local air cargo deliveries could flip their position either way."

Airbus topples Boeing from top spot - DW (English),"Thu, 02 Jan 2020 11:23:54 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR3LmNvbS9lbi9haXJidXMtdG9wcGxlcy1ib2VpbmctYXMtYmlnZ2VzdC1wbGFuZS1tYWtlci9hLTQ5NTM2NTM50gFNaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuZHcuY29tL2VuL2FpcmJ1cy10b3BwbGVzLWJvZWluZy1hcy1iaWdnZXN0LXBsYW5lLW1ha2VyL2EtNDk1MzY1Mzk?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing has seen a sharp fall in deliveries as its bestselling MAX jets remain grounded following two fatal crashes. It's not the first time the US plane maker has lost the crown to its European rival.

Europe's Airbus has become the world's biggest plane maker this year as its US rival Boeing struggles to get its bestselling MAX jets back in the skies.

Airbus — which has trailed Boeing since 2012 — delivered a record 863 aircraft in 2019, Reuters news agency reported, citing airport and tracking sources. Boeing, on the other hand, had delivered just 345 planes by the end of November and is on course for its worst performance in more than a decade, mainly hurt by the grounding of the MAX aircraft.

The US plane maker delivered 806 aircraft in 2018, slightly more than its European rival's tally of 800.

Boeing's 737 MAX jets have remained grounded since March last year following a fatal crash of the plane in Ethiopia that killed 157 people. The tragedy took place less than five months after another MAX crashed in the Java Sea off the Indonesian coast, killing 189 people. The grounding has cost the plane maker more than $9 billion (€8 billion) so far.

Boeing, which is also facing several compensation claims from victims' families and airlines hit by the grounding, has reported just 30 new orders for its MAX planes since the crash in Ethiopia. The plane maker said last month it would suspend production of the beleaguered aircraft in January amid concerns that the grounding would last well into this year.

The single-aisle 737 MAX, first delivered in May 2017, has been Boeing's bestselling plane ever, with more than 350 planes registered and about 5,000 on order. The MAX program is critical to the company. It represents nearly 80% of Boeing's commercial aircraft order backlog and nearly 60% by value.

Boeing-Airbus rivalry

Boeing and Airbus have been involved in a fierce competition over the past decade to win orders for new jets and occupy the top spot in the jetliner industry. The two are also part of a 15-year-old World Trade Organization dispute, blaming each other of being unfairly subsidized by their governments.

Airbus reigned as the world' biggest plane maker for a decade till 2012 when Boeing regained the top spot after delivering more jets.

Boeing launched its 737 MAX planes in response to Airbus' fuel-efficient, single-aisle A320 Neo jets which became an instant success among airlines. The two rivals have combined orders in excess of 11,500 for the two jets, underscoring airlines' preference for fuel-efficient jets.

Airbus had initially planned to set a new industry record by shipping up to 890 planes this year. In October, it trimmed its forecast to 860 deliveries, citing its production issues. Boeing had planned to deliver more than 900 aircraft but was forced to suspend its delivery forecast following the MAX groundings.

Airbus is also poised to comfortably win the annual order battle with its US rival. The European plane maker logged 718 net orders between January and November last year compared with Boeing's negative total of 84. Boeing saw more cancellations than orders during that period.

Boeing's order book does not yet include a letter of intent for 200 MAX planes announced by British Airways owner IAG at the Paris air show in June.

Boeing, however, continues to lead Airbus in deliveries of wide-body, larger planes such as Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and Airbus' A350, which enjoy bigger profit margins. Boeing delivered 224 wide-body planes compared with Airbus' 147."
Airbus demonstrates first fully automatic vision-based take-off - Airbus,"Thu, 16 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMC0wMS1haXJidXMtZGVtb25zdHJhdGVzLWZpcnN0LWZ1bGx5LWF1dG9tYXRpYy12aXNpb24tYmFzZWQtdGFrZS1vZmbSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse, 16 January 2020 – Airbus has successfully performed the first fully automatic vision-based take-off using an Airbus Family test aircraft at Toulouse-Blagnac airport. The test crew comprising of two pilots, two flight test engineers and a test flight engineer took off initially at around 10:15 am on 18 December and conducted a total of 8 take-offs over a period of four and a half hours.

“The aircraft performed as expected during these milestone tests. While completing alignment on the runway, waiting for clearance from air traffic control, we engaged the auto-pilot,” said Airbus Test Pilot Captain Yann Beaufils. “We moved the throttle levers to the take-off setting and we monitored the aircraft. It started to move and accelerate automatically maintaining the runway centre line, at the exact rotation speed as entered in the system. The nose of the aircraft began to lift up automatically to take the expected take-off pitch value and a few seconds later we were airborne.”

Rather than relying on an Instrument Landing System (ILS), the existing ground equipment technology currently used by in-service passenger aircraft in airports around the world where the technology is present, this automatic take-off was enabled by image recognition technology installed directly on the aircraft.

Automatic take-off is an important milestone in Airbus’ Autonomous Taxi, Take-Off & Landing (ATTOL) project. Launched in June 2018, ATTOL is one of the technological flight demonstrators being tested by Airbus in order to understand the impact of autonomy on aircraft. The next steps in the project will see automatic vision-based taxi and landing sequences taking place by mid-2020.

Airbus’ mission is not to move ahead with autonomy as a target in itself, but instead to explore autonomous technologies alongside other innovations in areas such as materials, electrification and connectivity. By doing so, Airbus is able to analyse the potential of these technologies in addressing the key industrial challenges of tomorrow, including improving air traffic management, addressing pilot shortages and enhancing future operations. At the same time Airbus is leveraging these opportunities to further improve aircraft safety while ensuring today’s unprecedented levels are maintained.

For autonomous technologies to improve flight operations and overall aircraft performance, pilots will remain at the heart of operations. Autonomous technologies are paramount to supporting pilots, enabling them to focus less on aircraft operation and more on strategic decision-making and mission management.

This outcome is the result of reporting, cooperation and new compliance standards at Airbus

Airbus is determined to conduct business with integrity

Amsterdam, 31 January 2020 - Airbus has reached final agreements with the French Parquet National Financier (PNF), the U.K. Serious Fraud Office (SFO), and the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) resolving the authorities' investigations into allegations of bribery and corruption, as well as with the U.S. Department of State (DoS) and the DoJ to resolve their investigations into inaccurate and misleading filings made with the DoS pursuant to the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).



Airbus has agreed to pay penalties of € 3,598 million plus interest and costs to the French, U.K. and U.S. authorities. The settlements with each authority are as follows: PNF € 2,083 million, the SFO € 984 million, the DoJ € 526 million and the DoS € 9 million of which € 4.50 million may be used for approved remedial compliance measures.



Airbus received credit from the authorities for having reported and for its consistently strong cooperation during the investigations.



Convention Judiciaire d'Intérêt Public with the PNF

Airbus has agreed to enter into a Convention Judiciaire d'Intérêt Public with the PNF. This agreement does not amount to an admission of liability. Under this agreement, the PNF has agreed to suspend prosecution of Airbus for a duration of three years. Prosecution will be discontinued if Airbus complies with the terms of the agreement throughout this period, which it is committed to doing. The agreement also contains an obligation for Airbus to submit its compliance programme to targeted audits carried out by the Agence Française Anticorruption (AFA) over a period of three years.

Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the SFO

Airbus has agreed to enter into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the SFO. This agreement does not amount to an admission of liability. Under this agreement, the SFO has agreed to suspend prosecution of Airbus for a duration of three years. Prosecution will be discontinued if Airbus complies with the terms of the agreement throughout this period, which it is committed to doing. In light of the continuing monitorship to be conducted by the French Anti-Corruption body, the AFA, no independent compliance monitor will be imposed on Airbus under the agreement with the SFO.

Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the DoJ

Airbus has agreed to enter into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the DoJ. Under this agreement, the DoJ has agreed to suspend prosecution of Airbus for a duration of three years. Prosecution will be discontinued if Airbus complies with the terms of the agreement during this period, which it is committed to doing. No independent compliance monitor will be imposed on Airbus under the agreement with the DoJ.

Consent Agreement with the DoS

Finally, Airbus has agreed to enter into a Consent Agreement with the DoS. Under this agreement, the DoS has agreed to settle all civil violations of the ITAR outlined in Airbus' voluntary disclosures identified in the Consent Agreement, and Airbus has agreed to retain an independent export control compliance officer, who will monitor the effectiveness of Airbus' export control systems and their compliance with the ITAR.

For legal reasons, Airbus cannot make any comment on the agreed Statements of Facts published by the investigating authorities.

Airbus has taken significant steps to reform itself and to ensure that this conduct will not reoccur. Airbus has significantly enhanced its compliance system under the supervision of an Independent Compliance Review Panel. The Company is committed to conducting business with integrity.

Denis Ranque, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Airbus, stated: “The settlements we have reached today turn the page on unacceptable business practices from the past. The strengthening of our compliance programmes at Airbus is designed to ensure that such misconduct cannot happen again. The agreements also reflect that the decision to voluntarily report and cooperate with the authorities was the right one. The commitment from the Board, and its Ethics and Compliance Committee, to provide full support to the investigation and the implementation of globally recognised compliance standards have paved the way to today’s agreements.”

Guillaume Faury, Chief Executive Officer of Airbus, added: “The agreements approved today with the French, UK, and US authorities represent a very important milestone for us, allowing Airbus to move forward and further grow in a sustainable and responsible way. The lessons learned enable Airbus to position itself as the trusted and reliable partner we want to be.”

Airbus will continue to cooperate with the authorities in the future, pursuant to the agreements, and to install a strong Ethics & Compliance culture within the Company."

Mobile, AL, USA – Airbus announced today that, as part of its plan to produce 63 A320 Family aircraft per month in 2021, the company will expand its industrial footprint in the U.S. by increasing the production rate of A320 family aircraft at its Airbus U.S. Manufacturing Facility in Mobile to seven per month by the beginning of next year. This increase, and continued recruiting for the A220 manufacturing team, will result in a further 275 jobs added at the Alabama-based facility over the next year. The company will also invest another $40 million through construction of an additional support hangar on the site, bringing its total investment to more than $1 billion in the Gulf Coast city.

Airbus’ announcement comes on top of huge growth in 2019, when the company added 600 new jobs at the manufacturing site. With plans already in place for production of four A220 aircraft per month in Mobile by the middle of the decade, Airbus is on track to produce more than 130 aircraft in Mobile each year for its airline customers.



Reflecting on the growth and continued investment in the U.S., Airbus Americas Chairman and CEO C. Jeffrey Knittel said, “Airbus has been manufacturing in the U.S. for many years now through our helicopter, aircraft and satellite products. This increase in commercial aircraft production in Mobile is an exciting expansion of our significant industrial investment in the U.S., and it continues Airbus’ positive contribution to American aerospace.”



Knittel continued, “We have invested more than $1 billion in Mobile because of the terrific team of employees there – and because of the support and welcome we continue to receive from the Gulf Coast community and State and Congressional leaders like Senator Richard Shelby, who has been with us from the beginning. We look forward to building on that strong relationship with our neighbors. This goes beyond jobs to include our support of education initiatives and future workforce development that will positively impact the community for decades to come along the Gulf Coast.”



In addition to its operations in Mobile, Airbus has extensive presence throughout the U.S. The company employs approximately 4,000 people at 38 locations in 16 states. Among its other facilities in the U.S. Airbus has: an engineering center in Kansas; training facilities in Florida and Colorado; materials support and headquarters in Virginia; an innovative think tank (A3) in California; a drone data analysis business in Georgia; helicopter manufacturing and assembly facilities in Texas and Mississippi; and a satellite manufacturing facility (OneWeb Satellites) in Florida. Furthermore, in the last three years alone, Airbus has spent nearly $50 billion in the U.S. with more than 450 U.S. suppliers, supporting more than 275,000 American jobs.



In addition to the rate increase and new team members, Airbus will have a lot more to celebrate in Mobile in 2020: Defense and Space will celebrate its 15th anniversary in April; Airbus’ newest final assembly line for the A220 will open, and the delivery of the first U.S.-made A220 will take place. The company will also welcome the graduation of the first students from the FlightPath9 high school student training program in May, participate in the opening of the Flight Works Alabama aviation experience center in June, and deliver its 200th U.S.-built A320 family aircraft in the summer.

Note for editors (Airbus history in Mobile):

The partnership between Airbus and the Gulf Coast community began 15 years ago this year, and it has grown exponentially over the past decade and a half.

Airbus Defense & Space was established in 2005 in Mobile to support operators of the C212 and CN235 tactical transports with complete maintenance, repair and overhaul services; extensive material services; professional engineering; and technical support. In 2015, it was named as the company’s worldwide support center for C212 aircraft. Today, 70 Airbus professionals are employed at the Mobile Regional Airport operation.

Airbus opened an Engineering center in Mobile in 2007. Exceeding Airbus’ original commitment for 150 engineers, this facility is now home to 220 engineers and support staff. The center’s initial focus on cabin engineering and A350 XWB design work has expanded to include design, engineering and support of nearly all of Airbus’ commercial aircraft products.

In 2015, Mobile became home to Airbus’ first U.S.-based commercial aircraft manufacturing facility. Celebrating its fifth year of production, this facility has grown from an initial workforce of around 250 producing A320 Family aircraft to more than 1,000 building A220 and A320 Family aircraft by the end of 2019. By the end of 2020 that number will be around 1,300."

Airbus Beluga XL - Biggest Planes in the World - Beluga XL Specs - Popular Mechanics,"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHVsYXJtZWNoYW5pY3MuY29tL2ZsaWdodC9haXJsaW5lcy9hMzA1MjA2NTcvYWlyYnVzLWJlbHVnYS14bC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"From beefy machines to behemoth buildings , we’re big fans of big suckers—so much that we once came up with a list of the biggest things in the world and only stopped at 50 because we had to meet a deadline . Our love for the large especially includes prodigious planes , so you can imagine how long we’ve been waiting to see the much-anticipated Airbus BelugaXL—a colossal cargo plane that will carry aircraft parts between Europe and China—officially take to the skies after years of tinkering and testing.

Last week, the BelugaXL—not to be confused with its almost-as-big, but crucially not-as-big predecessor, the regular ol’ Beluga—made its first true operational flight after logging more than 200 flight tests in the years since its development in 2014.

H. Gousse/Master Films/Airbus Service entry of the first BelugaXL occurred five years after the program’s launch in November 2014.

Airbus engineers built the classic Beluga—otherwise known as the A300-600 Super Transporter—to lug large aircraft parts between production facilities. It entered service in 1995, effectively replacing the equally badass Super Guppy , and had a good run until Airbus determined the five original planes in the fleet couldn’t keep up with production growth.

Enter the XL, the outside cargo version of the A300-600. After scouting rival biggies like the Antonov An-124 and Boeing C-17 (Dreamlifter), Airbus engineers ultimately elected to modify their A330-200 Freighter to build a better Beluga.

The XL is powered by twin Rolls-Royce Trent 700 turbofan engines and features a lowered cockpit and colossal cargo bay. At 63 meters long (seven more than the Beluga 1.0) and 8 meters wide (compared to 7), it has the largest cross-section of any cargo aircraft in the world, full stop. Plus, it can carry two A350 XWB wings. The old Beluga, by comparison, could only carry one such wing. Hence what Airbus says is the XL’s additional 30 percent transport capacity.

H. Gousse/Master Films/Airbus Airbus’ BelugaXL is based on the A330-200 Freighter.

At nearly 62 feet high, the XL stands a good six feet taller than the original Beluga. With a max payload of 51 tons—the equivalent of seven elephants—a range of 2,200 nautical miles, and a cruising speed of Mach 0.69, the XL is designed to fly more than 4 million miles a year. It will transport gargantuan gear from various production factories in Europe to assembly lines in France, Germany, and China.

Of course, the BelugaXL looks like an actual XL-sized whale; that massive cargo bay tacked on the fuselage gives gives it the distinct shape. But the plane also has eyes and flashes a smile, which you don’t see every transporter sport these days. Twenty-thousand Airbus employees chose the cheeky design, according to CNN .

H. Gousse/Master Films/Airbus The plane that made the inaugural XL flight is the first of six that will fly alongside the original Belugas.

Bertrand George, head of the Beluga XL program, told CNN that in Toulouse and Hamburg—the sites in France and Germany, respectively, of Airbus’ final assembly lines—the local children recognize the Beluga because of the blubbery build and signature smile. “They love this very special plane,” George said. Kids, so do we.

The plane that made the inaugural XL flight is the first of six that will fly alongside the original Belugas, according to Airbus. The rest of the craft will debut by 2023, while Airbus will eventually phase out and sell the older Belugas .

Sadly, passengers cannot fly in the BelugaXL. But man, just imagine what it would be like if we could."
SFO enters into €991m Deferred Prosecution Agreement with Airbus as part of a €3.6bn global resolution - Serious Fraud Office,"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zZm8uZ292LnVrLzIwMjAvMDEvMzEvc2ZvLWVudGVycy1pbnRvLWU5OTFtLWRlZmVycmVkLXByb3NlY3V0aW9uLWFncmVlbWVudC13aXRoLWFpcmJ1cy1hcy1wYXJ0LW9mLWEtZTMtNmJuLWdsb2JhbC1yZXNvbHV0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"31 January, 2020 | Case Updates

The Serious Fraud Office has entered into a record-breaking Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the global aerospace company Airbus SE following its approval today by Dame Victoria Sharp, President of the Queen’s Bench Division.

Under the terms of the DPA, Airbus SE agrees to pay a fine and costs amounting to €991m here in the UK, and in total, €3.6bn as part the world’s largest global resolution for bribery, involving authorities in France and the United States.

The announcement comes a little under four years after the SFO began investigating the company over allegations that it had used external consultants to bribe customers to buy its civilian and military aircrafts.

The indictment, which has been suspended for the term of the DPA, covers five counts of failure to prevent bribery. The conduct involves Airbus’ Commercial and Defence & Space divisions. The conduct covered by the UK DPA took place across five jurisdictions: Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan and Ghana between 2011 and 2015.

The Judge ruled today in a public hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice that the total sum (€983.97m plus the SFO’s costs of €6.9m) reflected the gravity of the conduct, the full cooperation of Airbus SE in the investigation, and the programme of corporate reform and compliance put in place by new leadership at the top of the company.

As part of the DPA, the company has agreed to full cooperation with the SFO and its law enforcement partners in any future investigations and prosecutions, and disclosure of any subsequent wrongdoing by the company or its employees, subject to applicable laws. If the company does not honour the conditions of the DPA the prosecution may resume.

Airbus SE has also reached a Convention Judiciaire d’Intérêt Public with the Parquet National Financier (PNF) and a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the US Department of Justice and US Department of State today. In total, these agreements together with the SFO DPA require Airbus SE to pay approximately €3.6 billion (including €2,083,137,455 to the PNF and €525,655,000 to the US authorities) at the exchange rate at time of payment.

In her judgment, Dame Victoria Sharp said:

“The seriousness of the criminality in this case hardly needs to be spelled out. As is acknowledged on all sides, it was grave. The conduct took place over many years. It is no exaggeration to describe the investigation it gave rise to as worldwide, extending into every continent in which Airbus operates. The number of countries subject to intense criminal investigation by the various agencies, and the scale and scope of the wrongdoing disclosed in the Statement of Facts demonstrate that bribery was to the extent indicated, endemic in two core business areas within Airbus.”

Lisa Osofsky, Director of the SFO, said:

“Airbus paid bribes through agents around the world to stack the decks in its favour and win contracts around the globe. Corruption like this undermines free trade and fair development and it is to Airbus’s credit that it has admitted its culpability, cleaned its house and come forward to put this conduct to bed.

“A resolution of this scope would not have been possible without the commitment, determination and hard work of SFO staff and our French and American colleagues. We are also indebted to law-enforcement partners around the world for the support they provided in securing this record-breaking resolution.”

The SFO investigation remains active and the position in relation to individuals is being considered."
The Airbus-Boeing Duopoly Is Extremely Unbalanced - Yahoo Finance,"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9haXJidXMtYm9laW5nLWR1b3BvbHktbG9va3MtZXh0cmVtZWx5LTA4NTUxODgzMy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Whenever it’s seemed like Airbus SE might steal a march on Boeing Co., something has come along to throw a spanner in the works. A decade ago Airbus was consistently delivering more planes than its arch-rival but its competitiveness was eroded by the strong euro and the nightmare of building the ill-fated A380 superjumbo.

Until the two recent fatal crashes involving the Boeing 737 Max, it seemed like a similar story. While both companies had brimming order books, Boeing’s cash flow was going through the roof and Airbus was bedeviled by production difficulties on new commercial aircraft and technical troubles involving the A400m military transporter. A long-running World Trade Organization dispute with Boeing tilted in the Americans’ favor. Worst of all, Airbus found itself under investigation by U.K., French and U.S. authorities over allegations it paid bribes to win aircraft orders and violated arms export laws.

Tuesday’s news that Airbus has reached tentative agreement about a settlement of those cases ends a big management distraction and a cloud over the company’s investment case. The alleged payments to middlemen are a stain on Airbus’s history. The good news is that following a management clear-out, the manufacturer is well positioned to move on from this dark period.

There’s no clarity yet on the fines Airbus will end up paying; investors have long assumed they’ll run into the billions. But with almost 18 billion euros ($19.8 billion) of gross cash at the end of October, and a big cash inflow expected in the fourth quarter, Airbus will have no trouble paying the bill.

The A400m continues to be a burden on cash flow and Airbus is still having production difficulties, this time involving the A321 passenger jet. Even so, with the 737 Max still grounded and Boeing facing a backlash from regulators and customers, the duopoly is starting to look very unbalanced.

Airbus trounced Boeing last year on orders and deliveries, and 2020 isn’t shaping up any better for the Americans. Reports that Boeing’s new boss Dave Calhoun wants to rethink his company’s plans for a new mid-market aircraft should allow Airbus’s long-range A321XLR to lock up more orders.

Story continues

To be sure, a wounded rival is dangerous thing. Boeing could yet decide that the best way to leave behind the 737 Max ignominy is to build a completely new single-aisle aircraft, which would oblige Airbus to follow suit. Yet the almost 50% increase in Airbus’s share price since the start of 2019, reflects hopes it will be able finally to press home its advantage and lift cash returns to shareholders. The shares rose another 3% on Tuesday, valuing the company at 107 billion euros ($118 billion).

A decade ago Airbus was worth just 11 billion euros. While it’s long been Boeing’s equal in technical innovation, in profitability and cash terms the European plane-maker seemed a tortoise to Boeing’s hare. After the 737 Max disasters we can see the corners Boeing cut to engineer that success, from squeezing suppliers to browbeating regulators. Airbus can afford to reward shareholders without being so aggressive.

Paying bribes to win business is deplorable; selling a fundamentally unsafe aircraft is worse. Both companies have lessons to learn but Airbus’s wounds are closer to healing.

The Airbus-Boeing rivalry – in post-scandal reform - The Christian Science Monitor,"Wed, 29 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNzbW9uaXRvci5jb20vQ29tbWVudGFyeS90aGUtbW9uaXRvcnMtdmlldy8yMDIwLzAxMjkvVGhlLUFpcmJ1cy1Cb2Vpbmctcml2YWxyeS1pbi1wb3N0LXNjYW5kYWwtcmVmb3Jt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In future textbooks about corporate ethics, one chapter should certainly be dedicated to how two great rivals in aviation – Boeing and Airbus – were also rivals in how they fixed their company culture after each suffered a major scandal.

So far, their stories of reform are a good read.

For Airbus, the climax of its recovery may have come this week. It announced Tuesday that it expects to pay nearly $4 billion in penalties to settle corruption cases with France, Britain, and the United States. That would be one of the largest fines for corporate corruption in recent years. The hefty penalties, if approved by the courts, as well as a possible legal admission of guilt, are just part of a long process of reform for the European plane-maker.

Four years ago – and much to its credit – Airbus self-reported to authorities that its reliance on third-party sales agents to sell jets had resulted in cases of bribery. Outside experts were brought in to clean up the company and create more transparency. The use of middlemen ended. More than 100 Airbus employees were let go. And a new chief executive, Guillaume Faury, said ethical compliance was priority No. 1.

“To embed irreproachable behaviors in all our business undertakings sustainably, we must take a hard look at both our systems and our culture,” he said soon after taking the helm.

In Boeing’s case, the scandal revolves around two fatal crashes of its 737 Max aircraft over the past two years, one in Ethiopia and the other in Indonesia. The aircraft was grounded last March by the U.S.

Internal memos revealed that a few employees knew of flaws in the aircraft that some pilots might be able to deal with. In the rush to compete with a new Airbus jet, Boeing was lax in its design and in its communication with regulators and airlines.

The technical fix to get the 737 Max back in the air is underway. But in the meantime, Boeing has apologized to families of the crash victims and set up a fund for them. It has also set up a better way for employees to funnel complaints. In December, its chief executive was fired and a new chief, David Calhoun, now promises to restore Boeing’s reputation for engineering integrity.

“We’re just going to get back down to restoring trust with one another, trust with our customers, and trust with our regulator,” he said in mid-January.

Both companies have a strong financial interest to make rapid reforms and comply with authorities. But at a time of any self-made crisis, executives also have an interest in conducting a deep moral audit of their companies. Airbus and Boeing have long had ethical codes. What’s key to avoiding mistakes, according to Gale Andrews, Boeing’s former chief ethics officer, “is the underlying moral intent.”

On that score the companies must outdo themselves even as they try to outdo each other in building better airplanes."
From CASA to FCAS: A Brief Analysis of Airbus and the Spanish Aerospace & Defense Industry - Defense & Security Monitor,"Tue, 07 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL2RzbS5mb3JlY2FzdGludGVybmF0aW9uYWwuY29tLzIwMjAvMDEvMDcvZnJvbS1jYXNhLXRvLWZjYXMtYS1icmllZi1hbmFseXNpcy1vZi1haXJidXMtYW5kLXRoZS1zcGFuaXNoLWFlcm9zcGFjZS1kZWZlbnNlLWluZHVzdHJ5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"by J. Kasper Oestergaard, European Correspondent, Forecast International.

From humble beginnings and isolation during the Francoist dictatorship, Spain has become one of the world’s leading producers and exporters of aerospace & defense equipment and recently joined the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) project, which includes the development of a next-generation fighter jet to replace the Eurofighter Typhoon and Dassault Rafale.

According to Forecast International’s International Military Markets research, over the past two decades, Spanish defense investment has reflected a whipsaw driven by economic realities. When Spain’s economy – and that of the larger Eurozone – has experienced healthy stretches, the nominal topline defense budget has undergone a parallel track. During periods of slow growth or outright recession, the defense budget has suffered. In 2019, Spain’s defense spending is expected have risen by 0.9% to EUR8.5 billion ($9.7 billion).

In late 2018, the Spanish government approved an investment package worth EUR7.3 billion ($8.3 billion) that covers defense and security programs within a multiyear period culminating in 2032, including three major defense projects involving an order of five F110 class multi-mission frigates as well as new 8×8 wheeled armored vehicles for the Spanish Army, and an upgrade and modernization of the Air Force’s fleet of 73 Eurofighter Typhoon multi-role fighter jets.

According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), with 2018 arms exports amounting to $1.2 billion, Spain is the third biggest arms exporter in Europe and ranks fifth in the world. Over the five-year period from 2014 to 2018, aircraft account for the majority of Spain’s exports, followed by ships and sensor systems. The country’s top exports were C295 transport aircraft and A330 MRTT tankers, Hobart class destroyers, and Ajax (Scout SV) armored fighting vehicles. Airbus, Navantia, General Dynamics European Land Systems, Indra Sistemas, and Sociedad Anónima de Electrónica Submarina (SAES) were the major Spanish arms exporters.

The International Trade Administration (ITA), a U.S. Department of Commerce agency, estimates the value of Spanish aerospace & defense production at $12.4 billion in 2019, up from $11.8 billion and $11.2 billion in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Exports were estimated at $7.3 billion in 2019 compared to $4.5 billion in imports resulting in a trade surplus of $2.8 billion. The Spanish aerospace & defense industry employs 56,000 people, up 65% since 2000.

Airbus in Spain

The by far largest Spanish aerospace & defense company, and the main driver of aerospace growth, is Airbus and its subsidiaries. In 2000, Spanish aircraft manufacturer Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA (CASA) became part of the newly formed EADS under the name EADS CASA. At the same time, CASA’s commercial aircraft production programs were absorbed by Airbus. In 2009, EADS CASA was absorbed into Airbus Military and is today part of Airbus Defense and Space. The Spanish state owns 4.16% of Airbus SE through Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales (SEPI) and therefore has significant political influence, however, Airbus is still dominated by Germany and France, each holding 11% ownership, with the remaining 74% of the company held by public shareowners.

Of Airbus’s 134,000 employees, 13,700 are located in Spain. The majority of employees work for Airbus Defence and Space with the remainder supporting Airbus’ production of commercial aircraft and rotorcraft. According to Airbus, the company accounts for more than half of the total Spanish aerospace & defense sales and subcontracts work to approximately 2,000 domestic suppliers.

Airbus’ facilities in the Seville region serve as a cornerstone for the Andalusian Aerospace Cluster, which brings the company together with the region’s aerospace stakeholders and players, including tier 1 and lower-tier suppliers, universities, technology centers, entrepreneurial organizations, unions, and the regional government.

Among other components, Spain produces the horizontal stabilizers for the entire range of Airbus commercial aircraft at facilities in Getafe, Illescas, and Puerto Real. The facility in Getafe is responsible for designing, engineering and manufacturing of components for all Airbus aircraft including the horizontal stabilizer for the A380, the assembly and testing of the horizontal stabilizers for the A350, A330 and the single-aisle A320 Family. The Getafe site also produces the tail cones for the A350 and A380. The facility in Illescas specializes in aviation composites and is responsible for the manufacture of components for the empennage and aft fuselage of all Airbus aircraft variants. The A350 wing’s entire lower cover is also produced at the site. The Puerto Real site produces horizontal stabilizer lateral boxes for the A350 and A330 programs as well as elevators for the A320 Family. Final assembly and functional testing of the A380 horizontal stabilizer also takes place in Puerto Real.

Airbus Helicopters operates two facilities in Albacete and Getafe, where rotary-wing aircraft are designed, developed, integrated, flight tested and certified. Final assembly of the Tiger attack helicopter and multi-role NH90 rotorcraft are performed in Spain, along with subassembly production for tail booms on the Tiger and H135 light utility helicopter, and the NH90’s forward fuselage.

Airbus Defence and Space employs the largest share of the company’s Spanish workforce across five facilities. The San Pablo and Tablada sites, located in the Seville area, form the epicenter of Airbus’ military transport business and work includes the final assembly of both the A400M Atlas four-engine turboprop airlifter and the twin-turboprop C295 and CN235. Seville also is home to the International Training Centre and Delivery Centre for Airbus military aircraft. The Getafe site houses the A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) conversion center, where the refueling systems and military avionics are installed. Getafe was also responsible for the A400M tanker certification flight tests in cooperation with the Spanish Air Force. Airbus also undertakes Eurofighter Typhoon parts manufacturing and assembly work at the Getafe site. In addition, the facility in Illescas manufactures components for the empennage and aft fuselage of the Eurofighter Typhoon. The Barajas and Tres Cantos sites near Madrid support most European Space Agency (ESA) programs, including the Ariane 5 and 6 commercial launch vehicles, the Copernicus Earth observation platforms, and the Galileo satellite navigation constellation. Barajas also serves as prime contractor for the PAZ and Ingenio Earth observation satellites and ESA’s CHEOPS spacecraft.

Furthermore, Airbus holds 38% ownership in Alestis Aerospace, a key Spanish aerostructures supplier.

Future Perspectives

At the 2019 Paris Air Show, the defense ministers of France, Germany, and Spain signed an accord launching the trilateral framework of cooperation on FCAS which, among other components, entails the development of a next-generation fighter jet operational in 2040. When production led by Airbus and Dassault commences, the project will provide substantial revenue for the Spanish aerospace industry for many years.

However, the Spanish Air Force and Navy are in need of new aircraft already in the 2025-2030 timeframe or at least 10 years before the FCAS fields a new fighter jet. Therefore, the two services need to bridge the gap with other aircraft and are in the early stages of an analysis in which the F-35 aircraft is emerging as a key contender.

The Spanish Navy considers the F-35B short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) variant the only option on the market to replace its 12 EAV-8B (VA.2 Matador II) Harrier jets. According to Cdr. Antonio Estevan, a staff officer at the service’s plans and policy division, the Navy’s Harriers are launched from the LPH Juan Carlos I, which features a short, ski-jump deck from which only the F-35B (and the aging Harrier) can take off and land.

At the same time, Air Force officials have several options in their search for a replacement aircraft for their fleet of 84 Boeing F-18 Hornets. According to Brig Gen. Juan Pablo Sanchez de Lara, chief of the Spanish Air Force’s plans division, 20 “A” variant jets, stationed in the Canary Islands, need to be replaced already by 2025. While these aircraft are likely to be replaced by new Eurofighter Typhoons, the rest of the F-18 fleet is still up for grabs.

Joakim Kasper Oestergaard is Forecast International’s AeroWeb and PowerWeb Webmaster and European Editor. In 2008, he came up with the idea for what would eventually evolve into AeroWeb. Mr. Oestergaard is an expert in aerospace & defense market intelligence, fuel efficiency in civil aviation, defense spending and defense programs. He has an affiliation with Terma Aerostructures A/S in Denmark – a leading manufacturer of composite and metal aerostructures for the F-35 Lightning II.

Metro Aviation signs order for 12 additional EC145e helicopters - Airbus,"Wed, 29 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMC0wMS1tZXRyby1hdmlhdGlvbi1zaWducy1vcmRlci1mb3ItMTItYWRkaXRpb25hbC1lYzE0NWUtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Louisiana-based company’s order book now totals 43 of this simplified, lighter model in the H145 family

Anaheim, January 29, 2020 – Metro Aviation has ordered an additional 12 new EC145e helicopters from Airbus, announced today at the Heli Expo trade show in Anaheim, California. This deal brings Metro Aviation’s total number of EC145e helicopters ordered to 43.

Metro Aviation operates air medical helicopters and airplanes for healthcare providers and is a global leader for multi-mission helicopter customizations. Metro was the first customer for the EC145e when Airbus Helicopters launched the simplified, lower weight variant in 2015. In 2019, Airbus Helicopters, Inc. delivered the first EC145e locally produced at its industrial facility in Columbus, Miss. USA, where the remaining EC145e aircraft for Metro will also be produced.

“This new order comes as evidence of the sustained popularity of the EC145e among many air medical providers in the U.S., mainly because of its 200-300lbs payload increase compared to the legacy EC145 C2,” said Mike Stanberry, president at Metro Aviation. “Its simplified configuration, flexible cabin, and the fact that this aircraft is proven, powerful, reliable and affordable explain why demand has been so high.”

The twin-engine EC145e was initially introduced for use with Visual Flight Rules (VFR), and Metro worked with Genesys Aerosystems and S-TEC of Mineral Wells, Texas, to develop a FAA-approved avionics package that includes Supplemental Type Certificates for a Single Pilot/Dual Pilot Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) system; a VFR electronic flight instrument system (EFIS); and autopilot and stability augmentation system enhancements. A Transport Canada certification for the IFR package is pending.

“This new order further strengthens our longstanding relationship with Metro Aviation, who found a particular need within the industry and was able to fulfill those specific mission requirements with the EC145e,” said Romain Trapp, president of Airbus Helicopters, Inc. and head of the North America region. “Airbus is pleased to support those offering new solutions in the industry, and we are especially proud to locally produce helicopters used for critical life-saving missions.”

Airbus Helicopters has been present in North America for 50 years and operates out of three main sites, including its Columbus facility where it produces the UH-72A Lakota helicopter - also a derivative of the EC145 - for the U.S. Army. Airbus also locally produces the best-selling H125 helicopter in Columbus, and performs as the bulk of its helicopter completions for the North American market.

Spilled drinks in the cockpit have been linked to two incidents in which an airplane's engine shut down in the middle of a flight, according to aviation publication FlightGlobal.

Both unexpected shutdowns were on the newest Airbus wide-body jet, the A350, and involved Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines.

One of the shutdowns was on a Delta Air Lines flight from Detroit to Seoul, South Korea, on January 21. The flight was above northern Canada when the engine turned off. The flight diverted to Fairbanks, Alaska and was eventually canceled, according to data from FlightRadar24.

Airbus Helicopters announces H125 upgrades for aerial work - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLWFubm91bmNlcy1oMTI1LXVwZ3JhZGVzLWZvci1hZXJpYWwtd29yay_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters has announced a series of performance and safety improvements targeted at aerial work with the H125 AStar (also known as the Squrriel/Ecureuil) light single.

A power rating increase on the Safran Arriel 2D engine gives an additional 308 pounds (140 kilograms) external load capability. Thus far, the typical capability has been one metric ton, said Axel Aloccio, head of light helicopter programs at Airbus.

When used with BLR Aerospace’s FastFin tailboom aerodynamic enhancement, the additional load is 420 pounds (190 kilograms), said Aloccio. BLR’s components can be installed in production for approximately $70,000. The combination also increases hover ceiling from 11,100 feet (3,380 meters) to 13,400 feet (4,080 meters).

“Today, the Arriel 2D is derated on the H125 because we were unsure about how the airframe would withstand full power in terms of stress, loads and fatigue, and we were worried about controllability,” Aloccio explained. In recent months, Airbus conducted flight tests to measure precise stress levels. They proved the airframe can “absorb all the power.”

The modification is only a software change in the vehicle and engine management display supplied by Thales. It is free of charge in forward fit. In retrofit, Thales will charge “a few thousand euros,” Aloccio said. Thales would not confirm pricing. Approximately 1,000 H125s (including some sold under its previous name, AS350 B3e) are flying worldwide.

Airbus expects certification of the modification this summer. The H125 will henceforth offer the same takeoff power – 952 horsepower – as the heavier H130, instead of the current 847 horsepower. The flight manual will be updated and no training will be required, said Aloccio.

For sling load operations, the cargo swing is located right under the fuel tank, increasing the risk of fuel leak after a crash. Certification of a crash-resistant fuel system (CRFS) that can cope with that piece of equipment was received this month. The system guarantees no fuel will leak for 30 minutes after an accident and Airbus is making it standard on the H125.

The accompanying price increase, €35,000 ($39,000), is said to be below the actual cost of the CRFS. Retrofit is available for the same price on every model certified after 1994 in the Ecureuil family, such as the AS350 B3 and the EC130. The weight penalty stands at 33 pounds (15 kilograms), said Aloccio.

In the cockpit, the first limit indicator (the instrument that displays the first limit an engine parameter will reach) can now be used with a remote display. A Supplemental Type Certificate was received for the data retrieval and bluetooth transmission unit, said Aloccio. The remote display can be a tablet, for instance, and enables easier engine parameter monitoring during sling load operations, when the pilot has to focus on looking outside.

The other improvements are about visibility – a response to competition from the in-development Kopter SH09.

The instrument panel can be made 40 percent more compact, at no extra cost, while a “max pilot view kit” replaces part of the conventional floor with glass. Two additional upper windows are optional.

A cleansheet-design Ecureuil replacement program is unlikely to be launched any time soon. Aloccio said he asked his company’s chief financial officer. “She answered, ‘Guys, you have a 70% percent market share, why do you want a new helicopter?” he said."
Airbus to build second production line in France for A321 jets - Tech Xplore,"Tue, 21 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHhwbG9yZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIwLTAxLWFpcmJ1cy1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLWxpbmUtZnJhbmNlLWEzMjEuaHRtbNIBSmh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaHhwbG9yZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIwLTAxLWFpcmJ1cy1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLWxpbmUtZnJhbmNlLWEzMjEuYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus's A321 jets, the largest in its A320 family of single-aisle planes, have proven hugely popular with airlines

European aircraft maker Airbus said Tuesday it will build a new production line for its hugely popular A321 single-aisle jet in France, adding to the output of the original plant in Germany.

From 2022, the jets will be built at Airbus's headquarters in Toulouse, southern France, as well as in Hamburg, Germany.

""We are enjoying an unprecedented high demand for our winning A320neo family,"" in particular the A321 long-range and extra-long-range versions, Airbus chief operating officer Michael Schoellhorn said in a statement.

Production in Toulouse will take place at facilities previously used to build the A380 superjumbo, which Airbus decided to scrap last year after airlines found it too expensive to operate.

The company plans to increase production of planes in the A320 series to 63 a month by 2021 to fulfil back orders of more than 6,000 jets in December.

It had already announced earlier this month plans to increase production of A320 jets at its US factory in Alabama.

The A320 series, introduced in 1987, has garnered more orders than any plane in commercial aviation history, industry experts say, as demand for mid-range flights soars.

The planes are also the main competitors to Boeing's 737 line, which has suffered from the uncertain future for the 737 MAX.

The MAX was grounded by regulators last March after two crashes that killed a total of 346 people—one involving Indonesia's Lion Air and the other an Ethiopian Airlines jet.

Since then, Boeing has failed to allay safety concerns and secure approval from regulators to allow 737 MAX flights to resume, a headache for dozens of airlines who have already ordered the plane.

Airbus delivered 863 planes last year, with A320 models making up the majority at 642 planes, while Boeing delivered just 380 planes as customers cancelled MAX orders.

Airbus agrees to record $4bn settlement to end bribery probes - Al Jazeera English,"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vZWNvbm9teS8yMDIwLzEvMzEvYWlyYnVzLWFncmVlcy10by1yZWNvcmQtNGJuLXNldHRsZW1lbnQtdG8tZW5kLWJyaWJlcnktcHJvYmVz0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWxqYXplZXJhLmNvbS9hbXAvZWNvbm9teS8yMDIwLzEvMzEvYWlyYnVzLWFncmVlcy10by1yZWNvcmQtNGJuLXNldHRsZW1lbnQtdG8tZW5kLWJyaWJlcnktcHJvYmVz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Settlement means Airbus avoids corporate criminal charges that risked barring firm from public contracts in US and EU.

Airbus bribed public officials and hid the payments as part of a pattern of worldwide corruption, prosecutors said on Friday as the European planemaker agreed a record $4bn settlement with France, the United Kingdom and the United States.

The disclosures, made public after a nearly four-year investigation spanning sales to more than a dozen overseas markets, came as courts on both sides of the Atlantic formally approved settlements that lift a legal cloud that has hung over Europe’s largest aerospace group for years.

“It was a pervasive and pernicious bribery scheme in various divisions of Airbus SE that went on for a number of years,” US District Judge Thomas Hogan said.

The deal, effectively a corporate plea bargain, means Airbus has avoided criminal prosecution that would have risked barring it from public contracts in the US and European Union – a massive blow for a major defence and space supplier.

Prosecutors said individuals could still face criminal charges, however.

Airbus, shares of which closed down one percent, has been investigated by French and British authorities for alleged corruption over jet sales dating back more than a decade. It has also faced US inquiries over suspected violations of US export controls.

“In reaching this agreement today, we are helping Airbus to turn the page definitively” on corrupt past practices, French prosecutor Jean-Francois Bohnert said.

France’s financial prosecutor said the company had also agreed to three years of “light compliance monitoring” by the country’s anti-corruption agency.

The US Department of Justice said the deal was the largest-ever foreign bribery settlement.

Code name ‘Van Gogh’

In a packed hearing at London’s Royal Courts of Justice, an Airbus lawyer said the settlements “draw a clear line under the investigation and under the grave historic practices”.

Outlining detailed findings, the UK’s Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said Airbus had hired the wife of a Sri Lankan Airlines executive as its intermediary and misled Britain’s UK Export Finance export credit agency over her name and gender, while paying $2m to her company. The airline could not be reached for comment.

On defence deals, Airbus hired and disguised payments to a close relative of a government official in Ghana with no aerospace experience in connection with a sale of military transport planes, the SFO said. Ghana’s government could not immediately be reached.

Court filings in the UK and the US outlined efforts to keep relationships and payments secret, including the use of code names such as “Van Gogh” and payments described as “medications and dosages prescribed by Dr Brown”.

The SFO said Airbus sponsored a sports team owned by AirAsia executives while negotiating aeroplane orders.

AirAsia officials have strongly denied any wrongdoing in connection with the 2012 sponsorship agreement between the Caterham Formula 1 racing team and Airbus’s then-parent EADS.

AirAsia could not immediately be reached for comment.

The UK investigation also identified bribery allegations involving Taiwan’s TransAsia Airways, Garuda Indonesia and Citilink Indonesia.

Garuda and Citilink did not immediately respond to requests for comment. TransAsia went bankrupt in 2018.

The US court documents outlined bribery and lavish hospitality involving plane sales to China.

Network of middlemen

French and US prosecutors said the settlement covered Airbus only as a company and any current or former employees involved in related crimes could still be open to prosecution.

“With this settlement we’ve completed a first phase … we are now going to have to examine individual responsibilities,” French prosecutor Bohnert told reporters.

The UK’s SFO last year abandoned attempts to prosecute individuals following what was then a record bribery settlement with engine maker Rolls-Royce in 2017.

At the centre of the Airbus case was a decades-old system of third-party sales agents – a system run from a now-disbanded headquarters unit that at its height involved some 250 people and several hundreds of millions of euros of payments a year, sources familiar with the matter have said.

Airbus has said that it halted payments in 2014 after discovering false statements on the use of agents to the UK’s export credit agency and that it later took its findings to UK authorities.

An internal investigation, which racked up legal bills of around 100 million euros ($110mn) a year, led to a board-driven clear-out of top management and plunged Airbus into years of self-examination, hampering its sales efforts.

The probe also triggered an internal row over responsibility for lapses, with Airbus employees insisting they had no control over the choice of agents or offset deals handled under a separate entity, EADS, the former Airbus parent company.

Others say the system, with roots going back decades to an era when payments to win deals were tolerated and tax-deductible, was an open secret in the company and French political circles, where it was intertwined with influence-building abroad."
Officials welcome Airbus plans to expand Alabama A320 production - Made In Alabama,"Thu, 09 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hZGVpbmFsYWJhbWEuY29tLzIwMjAvMDEvb2ZmaWNpYWxzLXdlbGNvbWUtYWlyYnVzLXBsYW5zLXRvLWV4cGFuZC1hbGFiYW1hLWEzMjAtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“I look forward to seeing Airbus reach future milestones at its U.S. manufacturing home in Sweet Home Alabama.”

Airbus said today that it will increase the production rate of A320 family aircraft at its U.S. Manufacturing Facility in Mobile to seven per month by the beginning of 2021.

This increase, along with continued recruiting for the A220 manufacturing team, will result in 275 new Airbus jobs added at the Alabama-based facility over the next year.

GROWING INVESTMENT

Airbus’ announcement comes on top of strong growth in 2019, when the company added 600 new jobs at the manufacturing site.

With plans already in place for production of four A220 aircraft per month in Mobile by the middle of the decade, Airbus is on track to produce more than 130 aircraft in Alabama each year for its airline customers.

“This increase in commercial aircraft production in Mobile is an exciting expansion of our significant industrial investment in the U.S., and it continues Airbus’ positive contribution to American aerospace,” Airbus Americas Chairman and CEO C. Jeffrey Knittel said.

“We have invested more than $1 billion in Mobile because of the terrific team of employees there – and because of the support and welcome we continue to receive from the Gulf Coast community and State and Congressional leaders like Senator Richard Shelby, who has been with us from the beginning,” Knittel added.

“We look forward to building on that strong relationship with our neighbors. This goes beyond jobs to include our support of education initiatives and future workforce development that will positively impact the community for decades to come along the Gulf Coast.”

U.S. Sen. Richard Shelby commended Airbus for the additional investment and job creation.

“This expansion highlights Airbus’ continued commitment to Alabama. I am proud they are building advanced, state-of-the-art aircraft in our state and honored for this world-renowned company to call Mobile home,” he added.

‘CRITICAL MASS’

Airbus launched production of its best-selling A320 Family of aircraft at the Mobile facility in 2015, with the initial goal of producing four aircraft per month. Recently, the production rate has moving toward six A320 planes each month.

The company recently began producing its first Alabama-made A220 at its existing manufacturing facility. Construction is expected to be complete on the new A220 assembly line later this year, with the first delivery expected to follow soon after.

“The significant expansion of Airbus’ manufacturing activities in Mobile will make the area an even more attractive location for aerospace suppliers and service providers, which will bring in additional jobs and investment,” said Greg Canfield, Secretary of the Alabama Department of Commerce.

“With demand remaining strong for new aircraft, I’m confident that Mobile will see continued growth in the aviation sector as it builds toward critical mass.”

After last year’s hiring surge, Airbus now employs 1,000 people at the manufacturing site, located at the Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley. The company also operates an engineering center at Brookley that employs 220 and an Airbus Defense & Space unit that employs 70.

“Continued growth and expansion at Airbus is a tremendous benefit to the Mobile community. Over the last five-plus years, we’ve seen the region’s influence grow in the aerospace arena drawing additional suppliers, and with today’s announcement more than 1,000 high-paying jobs added to our community,” said David Rodgers, vice president of economic development for the Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce."
Airbus-Boeing conflict is set to escalate – GIS Reports - Geopolitical Intelligence Services AG,"Wed, 29 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdpc3JlcG9ydHNvbmxpbmUuY29tL3IvYWlyYnVzLWJvZWluZy1jb25mbGljdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus vs. Boeing: A dispute resolution crisis

Many expected the Airbus-Boeing trade conflict to be over by 2020. However, the latest developments show that tensions could rise. The U.S. has not only turned down peace offers from the EU, but it has also crippled the WTO, making it difficult for Europe to retaliate.

× In a nutshell The EU and the U.S. have long relied on the WTO to manage their aviation dispute

By blocking the appointment of WTO judges, Washington has escalated the conflict

The EU is likely to retaliate with tariffs if the U.S. remains unwilling to compromise

A decade-long trade dispute between European and American aircraft companies seems far from over. Last year, the European Union had expressed hope that the conflict would soon come to an end, but instead a new series of punitive tariffs were imposed.

Quid-pro-quo retaliations

To understand the current geopolitical developments, one must start at the very beginning. In the early 2000s, the United States launched a dialogue with the EU over its suspicion of illegal subsidies for Airbus through government loans, in particular from France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom. This led to an official complaint and a case at the World Trade Organization (WTO). The U.S. claimed that Airbus had received $22 billion in illegal aid, thus earning Airbus and the EU more than $200 billion.

Both sides were found to have illegally subsidized their aircraft makers through loans, contract terms and tax breaks.

Shortly after, the EU brought its own counter case alleging that U.S.-based Boeing had received $23 billion in illegal aid. The conflict quickly became a tit-for-tat dispute with numerous cases and counter cases. Both sides were found to have illegally subsidized their aircraft makers through a variety of loans, contract terms and tax breaks.

The situation began to escalate early in the autumn of 2019 when the WTO allowed the U.S. to impose tariffs worth billions of dollars on European goods, more specifically, 10 percent on Airbus and 25 percent on cheese, wine, whiskey, olives and the like. The ruling was clearly meant as a retaliation toward the Airbus consortium – France, Germany, Spain and the UK. With the tariffs soon followed a U.S. political power play aimed at limiting the EU’s chances of seeking out countermeasures within the WTO.

Beyond tariffs

The treaty-based WTO is an international organization created to promote free and fair trade across the world. Its appellate body, which can be described as a supreme court for global trade, is crucial for dispute resolution, as it hears appeals and has the competence to uphold, modify or reverse the legal findings and conclusions of a WTO panel. Without such a body, any trade disputes being appealed would be left in legal limbo. In effect, this would create a “wild west” environment where trade relations would follow a “might makes right” doctrine rather than international rules and binding decisions.

On December 11, 2019, the appellate body ceased to function for the first time since its creation 25 years ago. The panel is meant to have seven judges and needs a minimum of three to operate. However, in the course of the last few years, the U.S. has blocked the appointment of new judges. The body is now unable to hear disputes and issue rulings.

× Facts & figures In recent years, the EU's trade surplus with the U.S. has doubled, reaching 139.1 billion euros in 2018. Accordingly, Europe will be hesitant to jeopardize trade relations with its largest economic partner, but if no dispute resolution mechanism is found in the months ahead, it may not have an alternative. © macpixxel for GIS

Washington has effectively blocked the appointments of all but one judge, leaving the WTO shaken to its core. Officially, the U.S. has justified its move by claiming to have sovereignty concerns, and to be dissatisfied with the lengthy time of appeals. According to the U.S. administration, the appellate body has overstepped its authority and steered away from its task of interpreting existing law.

In the context of the Boeing vs. Airbus dispute, Washington has thus effectively ensured that the EU cannot appeal the tariffs aimed at its wine and cheese. The corresponding case, submitted by the EU on alleged illegal U.S. subsidies for Boeing, which was expected to be resolved in 2020, is now in legal limbo. Moreover, the current situation prevents future appeals against punitive U.S. measures resulting from the dispute between Boeing and Airbus. U.S. intentions to impose tariffs of up to 100 percent on additional European products as a consequence of France’s new digital services tax will also need to be tabled once the U.S. and France’s temporary tariff truce expires.

In parallel, on December 17, 2019 the U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means approved a resolution reaffirming America’s commitment to the World Trade Organization while simultaneously calling for its concerns with the WTO’s appellate body to be addressed.

Four unique Aston Martin signature designs available.

Courchevel, 3 January, 2020 – The ACH130 Aston Martin Edition, the first offering from the recently-announced partnership between Aston Martin Lagonda and Airbus Corporate Helicopters, was revealed today at Courchevel in the French Alps.



This stylish special edition of the ACH130 helicopter comes equipped with a range of four interior and exterior designs generated by Aston Martin which will delight helicopter owners and pilots who appreciate the pleasures of possessing and driving high performance bespoke luxury cars.



The aeronautical designers at Airbus Corporate Helicopters (ACH) and the automotive designers at Aston Martin have worked closely together for over a year, marrying ACH’s key values of excellence, quality and service with Aston Martin’s commitment to beauty, handcrafting and automotive art to bring a new level of aesthetics and rigorous attention to detail to the helicopter market.



Available in four external liveries with complementary interiors, the helicopters are embellished with Aston Martin signature elements, starting with the iconic Aston Martin wings, which are embossed onto luxury leather features, tastefully positioned throughout the cabin.



The Stirling Green-themed external scheme, which is already flying on the first aircraft, features a painted gradient, which fades down into Jet Black on the underside of the helicopter with Skyfall Silver around the cowlings. Further external liveries are available with other Aston Martin paint colours including Xenon Grey, Arizona and Ultramarine Black.



Inside, the automotive-inspired cabin, which offers a higher level of comfort, is trimmed in Pure Black ultra-suede with a palette of selectable leathers comprising Oxford Tan, Pure Black, Cormorant and Ivory.



On the rear of the front seats the same brogue detailing that is found in a DB11 runs down the centre of the seat and the doors have been trimmed with leather to provide passengers with comfortable touch points during their flight. By using materials from the Aston Martin automotive palette the interior of this special edition of the ACH130 sits in harmony with the interior of Aston Martin sports cars.



Each of these special edition helicopters will have a plaque included on the instrument panel which shows the partnership logos, the registration of the aircraft, the edition number and the owner’s name, should they wish to have it included.

Aston Martin Vice President and Chief Creative Officer, Marek Reichman, said: “We have our own set of automotive design principles but in recent years we have been learning how to apply our principles to other areas of design, such as architecture, motorcycles and now helicopters. This first application of our design practices to a helicopter posed a number of interesting challenges but we have enjoyed working through them. Beauty is of vital importance to Aston Martin and to our customers and we think the ACH130 Aston Martin Edition is an inherently beautiful machine. It provided a wonderful canvas for our team to work on so we now look forward to seeing everybody’s reaction.”



Frédéric Lemos, Head of Airbus Corporate Helicopters, also commented: “The ACH130 Aston Martin Edition is optimally positioned in the market for hands-on owners who draw satisfaction from personally piloting their aircraft and it generates strong brand-loyalty. In the same way Aston Martin’s products are cars for drivers who relish being at the wheel and they inspire a comparable attachment to the brand. So they are the perfect partner for us in developing this superb new ACH130 Aston Martin Edition.”



The ACH130 Aston Martin Edition is available on request with deliveries taking place from Q1 2020. For further information please visit: www.airbuscorporatehelicopters.com

How Airbus Has Grown Over The Years To Dethrone Boeing As The Largest Commercial Aircraft Maker - Trefis,"Fri, 03 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy50cmVmaXMuY29tL3N0b2NrL2JhL2FydGljbGVzLzQ3OTc5Ni9ob3ctYWlyYnVzLWhhcy1ncm93bi1vdmVyLXRoZS15ZWFycy10by1kZXRocm9uZS1ib2VpbmctYXMtdGhlLWxhcmdlc3QtY29tbWVyY2lhbC1haXJjcmFmdC1tYWtlci8yMDIwLTAxLTAz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus ended the year 2019 on a high, with the European commercial airplane manufacturer delivering 863 airplanes for the year in comparison to its larger rival Boeing, which could only manage 345 deliveries. While Airbus has done extremely well over recent years to ramp up production for its popular A320 family of jets, Boeing’s fortunes took a significant hit with the grounding of its 737 MAX aircraft earlier this year. Trefis compares key operating metrics for Boeing vs. Airbus over the years – highlighting how Airbus looked poised to overtake Boeing as the largest commercial aircraft manufacturer even before the latter ran into trouble.

Boeing, established in 1916, was the only airplane supplier till 1974 until Airbus (established in 1970) launched its first commercial airplane. Both companies today have a combined share of 91% in the commercial aircraft market globally. Notably, Airbus has been able to take market share away from Boeing over the last 5 years, and had an order book 56% larger than Boeing’s at the end of September 2019. We take a deep dive into the operating performance of both companies over last few years in our interactive dashboard, parts of which are highlighted below.

Understanding Delivery Numbers For Boeing and Airbus & Their Market Share Since 2014:

Growth in airplane deliveries has been higher for Airbus than for Boeing on account of Airbus A320 family

Boeing further had bleak deliveries in 2019 on account of the grounding of its 737 MAX series – an issue that is expected to be resolved only in Q4 2020.

Boeing delivered a total of 345 commercial aircraft in 2019 – down from 806 in 2018. On the other hand, Airbus’ aircraft deliveries has swelled from 629 in 2014 to 863 in 2019.

Airbus has improved its market share from 41.1% in 2014 to 45.3% in 2018.

We estimate Airbus’ market share to have spiked to almost 62.5% in 2019 due to the sizable reduction in deliveries for Boeing.

Order Backlog for Airbus and Boeing as on September 2019:

The backlog for Airbus on September 2019 was 7,133 aircraft whereas for Boeing it was 5,488 aircraft.

Boeing’s entire global fleet of 737 MAX aircraft was grounded in March 2019, following two fatal aircraft crashes.

The company had an order book of 4,636 units worth $600 billion of the 737 MAX family at the time of the grounding, and faces the threat of order cancellation from several airlines.

Additionally, Boeing’s average revenue per aircraft has been declining over the years while Airbus’s average revenue has remained stable. Additional details about how Airbus’ revenue per aircraft has trended over the years compared to Boeing are available in our interactive dashboard.

Airbus agrees to pay a huge fine to settle a bribery case - The Economist,"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb25vbWlzdC5jb20vZ3JhcGhpYy1kZXRhaWwvMjAyMC8wMS8zMS9haXJidXMtYWdyZWVzLXRvLXBheS1hLWh1Z2UtZmluZS10by1zZXR0bGUtYS1icmliZXJ5LWNhc2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ON JANUARY 31ST, following court approval, Airbus agreed to a record-breaking deferred prosecution agreement (DPA)—the largest deal ever to resolve allegations of bribery—with regulators in three countries. The planemaker will pay a total of €3.6bn ($4bn) to Britain’s Serious Fraud Office (SFO), France’s Parquet National Financier and America’s justice and state departments. The size of the fine, which dwarfs other bribery-related settlements in recent years, reflects serious, wide-ranging allegations concerning Airbus’s use of external consultants to bribe customers to buy its civilian and military aircraft in a number of markets. The company will hand over €500m more than it made in consolidated net income in 2018.



A DPA means that Airbus will face no formal charges. DPAs are corporate plea deals that allow companies to avoid a trial in return for co-operating with investigations, paying a fine and changing their behaviour. In the run-up to the settlement Airbus agreed to set up an independent compliance-review panel. It also replaced many of its senior executives. An American invention, DPAs are growing in popularity in Europe, too. Legislation allowing them in Britain was passed in 2013 and in France three years later. Airbus will be Britain’s seventh such settlement.



Fans of DPAs say they encourage firms that might otherwise keep quiet about fraud and corruption in their ranks to report themselves and then work with investigators. Critics say they let badly behaving companies off the hook. Their introduction in Britain was born of frustration. Prosecutors there have long struggled to secure corporate convictions because under English law the only way to attach criminal liability to companies is through the individuals who represent the “controlling mind” of the firm—typically senior executives and board members. Establishing direct links between top brass and wrongdoing in sprawling multinationals has proved to be fiendishly difficult.



Prosecutors may still set their sights on individuals in the wake of a DPA, and regularly do so. Indeed, the “statement of facts” attached to such deals often names employees allegedly involved in the wrongdoing. Here too, however, securing convictions has proved hard. Despite several trials, the SFO is yet to prosecute successfully any executive whose company confessed to wrongdoing under a DPA. (American prosecutors have had more success, both in getting companies to plead guilty and in having individuals convicted.) In the case of Rolls-Royce, the largest British settlement until Airbus—which cost the engineering company £497m ($614m) in 2017—the case was eventually dropped without anyone being charged, even after the judge had concluded that it involved “egregious criminality over decades”. Now, as before, it is usually shareholders who carry the can."
Airbus Investment in Mobile Surpasses $1 Billion - FLYING,"Mon, 13 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZseWluZ21hZy5jb20vYWlyYnVzLW1hbnVmYWN0dXJpbmctaW52ZXN0bWVudHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As part of a plan to produce 63 A320 family aircraft per month in 2021, Airbus announced that the company will expand its footprint in the U.S. by increasing the production rate of aircraft at its Airbus U.S. Manufacturing Facility in Mobile, Alabama, to seven per month by the beginning of next year. This increase, and continued recruiting for the A220 manufacturing team, will result in a further 275 jobs added at the Alabama-based facility over the next year.

The announcement adds to huge growth for Airbus in 2019, when the company added 600 new jobs at the Alabama manufacturing site. The company’s $40 million investment is for an additional support hangar on the site, bringing its total investment to more than $1 billion in the Gulf Coast city.

“Airbus has been manufacturing in the U.S. for many years now through our helicopter, aircraft and satellite products. This increase in commercial aircraft production in Mobile is an exciting expansion of our significant industrial investment in the U.S., and it continues Airbus’ positive contribution to American aerospace,” said Airbus Americas Chairman and CEO C. Jeffrey Knittel. “We have invested more than $1 billion in Mobile because of the terrific team of employees there – and because of the support and welcome we continue to receive from the Gulf Coast community and State and Congressional leaders like Senator Richard Shelby, who has been with us from the beginning. We look forward to building on that strong relationship with our neighbors. This goes beyond jobs to include our support of education initiatives and future workforce development that will positively impact the community for decades to come along the Gulf Coast.”

The Airbus operations in Mobile are part of an extensive Airbus presence in the U.S., where approximately 4,000 people are employed at 38 locations in 16 states. In addition to the Mobile manufacturing facility, Airbus has an engineering center in Kansas, training facilities in Florida and Colorado, materials support and headquarters in Virginia, a “think tank” in California, a drone data-analysis business in Georgia, helicopter manufacturing and assembly facilities in Texas and Mississippi, and a satellite manufacturing facility in Florida. Collectively, the company has spent nearly $50 billion in the U.S. in the last three years with more than 450 U.S. suppliers, supporting more than 275,000 American jobs.

The partnership between Airbus and the Gulf Coast community began 15 years ago this year when Airbus Defense & Space was established in 2005 in Mobile to support operators of the C212 and CN235 tactical transports with maintenance, repair and overhaul services and technical support. Airbus opened an engineering center in Mobile in 2007, a facility that is now home to 220 engineers and support staff. The center’s initial focus on cabin engineering and A350 XWB design work has expanded to include design, engineering, and support of nearly all of Airbus’ commercial aircraft products.

In 2015, Mobile became home to Airbus’ first U.S.-based commercial aircraft manufacturing facility. Now in its fifth year of production, the facility has grown from an initial workforce of around 250 producing A320 family aircraft to more than 1,000 building A220 and A320 family aircraft by the end of 2019. By the end of 2020, that number will be around 1,300.

In addition to the rate increase and new team members, Airbus will also welcome the graduation of the first students from the FlightPath9 high school student training program in May 2020, participate in the opening of the Flight Works Alabama aviation experience center in June, and deliver its 200th U.S.-built A320 family aircraft in the summer."

At the same time, AL.com reports that the Mobile City Council has approved a resolution urging President Donald Trump to continue current trade policy that exempts imported European aerospace components — a crucial element of Airbus production here — from tariffs.

“Imposing tariffs on aircraft component parts would drastically weaken and hinder current and future opportunities at the Airbus facility in Mobile,” U.S. Sen. Richard Shelby told AL.com.

Airbus has had a presence in Mobile since 2005, when it opened a C212 and CN235 support unit at Mobile Regional Airport. The Airbus engineering center, which now supports most commercial aircraft products, opened in 2007. The Final Assembly Line, the first such Airbus facility in the U.S., opened in 2015.

“Airbus has been manufacturing in the U.S. for many years now through our helicopter, aircraft and satellite products,” said Airbus Americas Chairman and CEO C. Jeffrey Knittel. “This increase in commercial aircraft production in Mobile is an exciting expansion of our significant industrial investment in the U.S., and it continues Airbus’ positive contribution to American aerospace.”

In 2019, Airbus outsold its U.S.-based rival Boeing, for the first time in the commercial aircraft market."

Britain orders Airbus H145 helos amid scramble to fix pilot shortage - Defense News,"Tue, 21 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS90cmFpbmluZy1zaW0vMjAyMC8wMS8yMS9icml0YWluLW9yZGVycy1haXJidXMtaDE0NS1oZWxvcy1hbWlkLXNjcmFtYmxlLXRvLWZpeC1waWxvdC1zaG9ydGFnZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON — Rotary pilot and rear crew training capabilities for the British military have been given a lift with an order for additional Airbus helicopters in part of a wider boost to a package of improvements announced Jan. 21 by the Ministry of Defence.

The £183 million (U.S. $238 million) deal will see Airbus supply four of its H145 helicopters to the rotary wing element of the U.K. Military Flying Training System program. UKMFTS is run by the Babcock-Lockheed Martin joint venture Ascent Flight Training Management in partnership with the MoD.

Aside from the H145 helos, known in Britain as Jupiters, the MoD has funded the acquisition of another simulator, made by Canadian vendor CAE, and infrastructure improvements at Royal Air Force Shawbury, the headquarters of Britain’s tri-service helicopter training effort.

“The new H145 helicopters and simulator will enable students to learn how to fly a range of missions, covering expected scenarios on operational deployment. In addition, the H145s enable students to practice winching tasks and rear crew activities,” the MoD said in a statement announcing the deal.

“It is part of a wider program to increase training capacity for UK military pilots overall, as part of the £3.2 billion UKMFTS program and helps address the increased demand for pilot training identified in the 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review,” the statement added.

The helicopter element of MFTS currently operates 29 Airbus H135s for basic training, and three H145s for more advanced pilot training and particularly for rear crew work like winching. The H135 is known in Britain as the Juno.

All four aircraft are expected to be delivered to the MFTS program by the end of this year.

The more than doubling of the H145 fleet reflects the increasing number of rotary rear crew and pilots required by the British military. Crew shortages in fixed- and rotary-wing sectors have caused concern at the MoD, with Defence Secretary Ben Wallace saying late last year that fixing the problem is a top priority.

To help meet demand, additional fixed-wing aircraft may also be added to a fleet that already includes T-6 Texans, Phenon multi-engine trainers and King Air rear crew trainers.

Airbus Agrees to Pay Nearly $4 Billion to Settle Bribery Case - Voice of America - VOA News,"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2EvZWNvbm9teS1idXNpbmVzc19haXJidXMtYWdyZWVzLXBheS1uZWFybHktNC1iaWxsaW9uLXNldHRsZS1icmliZXJ5LWNhc2UvNjE4MzUyMC5odG1s0gFwaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm9hbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL2Vjb25vbXktYnVzaW5lc3NfYWlyYnVzLWFncmVlcy1wYXktbmVhcmx5LTQtYmlsbGlvbi1zZXR0bGUtYnJpYmVyeS1jYXNlLzYxODM1MjAuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In the largest settlement of its kind, European aircraft maker Airbus SE has agreed to pay nearly $4 billion to resolve foreign bribery and other charges with authorities in the United States, Britain and France, the Justice Department announced Friday.

In an agreement with U.S. prosecutors, Paris-based Airbus, the world's second-largest manufacturer of civilian and military aircraft, admitted using intermediaries over several years to bribe government officials and airline executives in order to win lucrative contracts in China and other countries.

Airbus entered into a so-called deferred prosecution agreement with the Justice Department three days after federal prosecutors accused the company of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and conspiracy to violate the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) and its implementation regulations. Under the deferred agreement, prosecutors agree to hold off on proceeding with a case against a company in exchange for meeting certain conditions.

The foreign bribery charges against Airbus stemmed from its offer and payment of bribes to foreign officials, including Chinese government officials, according to the prosecution agreement. Involved in the China bribery scheme were at least seven unidentified Airbus executives — including two Chinese officials and three entities responsible for making aircraft purchasing decisions for the Chinese government.

Between 2013 and 2015, Airbus executives made payments to a business partner in China that were intended to be used as bribes to Chinese officials, according to prosecutors. The bribes were paid in order to win contracts for the sale of Airbus aircraft to Chinese government airlines.

The AECA charges resulted from Airbus' failure to disclose to U.S. authorities political contributions, fees and commissions made in connection with the sale and export of military goods and services to a foreign military.

""Airbus engaged in a multi-year and massive scheme to corruptly enhance its business interests by paying bribes in China and other countries and concealing those bribes,"" said Assistant Attorney General Brian A. Benczkowski of the Justice Department's Criminal Division. ""The Department will continue to work aggressively with our partners across the globe to root out corruption, particularly corruption that harms American interests.""

As part of the settlement, Airbus will pay nearly $600 million to U.S. authorities, $2.29 billion to authorities in France, and more than $1 billion to Britain's Serious Fraud Office. The settlement with British authorities involves allegations of bribes paid in Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Indonesia and Ghana.

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

Enacted in 1978, the FCPA bars corporations and their executives from bribing foreign government officials to gain a business advantage. Over the past decade, the Justice Department has stepped up enforcement of the law, using its broad jurisdiction to target foreign executives and companies involved in bribing officials in other countries. Enforcement has remained robust under the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump despite his past criticism of the law as unfair to American companies.

Historically, China has made up a disproportionately large number of FCPA cases involving foreign executives bribing Chinese officials. A 2018 Justice Department initiative aimed at countering Chinese national security threats to the U.S. prioritizes FCPA cases involving Chinese companies that compete with American businesses.

""International corruption involving sensitive U.S. defense technology presents a particularly dangerous combination,"" said David Burns, a senior official in the Justice Department's national security division.

The Justice Department encourages companies to self-report violations of foreign bribery and export control laws in exchange for leniency. Although Airbus disclosed the FCPA violations to the Justice Department only after they came to light in Britain several years ago, the company received credit for its cooperation with the ensuing investigation.

Motorsport can be a testbed for electric flight development. Here's how - Airbus,"Thu, 30 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIwLTAxLW1vdG9yc3BvcnQtY2FuLWJlLWEtdGVzdGJlZC1mb3ItZWxlY3RyaWMtZmxpZ2h0LWRldmVsb3BtZW50LWhlcmVzLWhvd9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Next year, the world’s first electric air racing competition will take to the skies. For Air Race E CEO Jeff Zaltman, this major milestone in motorsport is more than just the latest addition to the list of air racing events: it is an important testbed for the development of electric flight.

Jeff Zaltman knows a thing or two about organising competitive air racing events. This long-time devoted ambassador for air racing on a global scale has organised at least 15 major international air races, aerobatic championships and other events across nine countries and four continents. His next passion project? Air Race E, the world’s first electric air racing competition of which Airbus is Official Founding Partner.

With Air Race E, Jeff is laser-focused on leveraging the galvanising effect of motorsport to push the development of electric flight to the next level. An ambitious challenge for anyone, but one that Jeff is convinced is necessary to help guide the aerospace industry onto a sustainable path for future generations.

The world is depending on Airbus and partnerships like ours to guide the aerospace industry onto a sustainable path for generations to come.

- Jeff Zaltman, Air Race E CEO

5 questions with Jeff Zaltman, Air Race E CEO

Q. Why did you decide to launch Air Race E?

The idea for Air Race E has evolved in the aviation market over a long period of time, and many people suggested it to me. However, I had always made the assumption that it would be some time off in the future. Little by little, I realised we already had the expertise and technology available to make an electric air race happen. Soon after, I got started working on the race—and called Airbus! Airbus was an obvious choice as a serious partner who could help us really give the project substance and market application.

Q. At what stage of the planning and development phases are you at with Air Race E? Any exciting updates you can share?

We have covered a lot of ground since we first announced Air Race E in 2018. That was accelerated when Airbus joined as Official Founding Partner last year. Since then, many parties have become involved, and hundreds more are taking interest. We have at least eight race teams announced, and we’ll soon announce the locations of the first races.

Q. This is the first electric air racing competition of its kind in the world. How do you think motorsport can provide a “galvanising effect” for the development of electric flight?

Motorsport, in all its forms, has long been used as a platform for developing technologies and bringing applications to market. Historically, air racing has been integral in aerospace development. For example, the WWII British Spitfire was originally launched as a seaplane racer in the Schneider Trophy during the 1930s. We’re now entering a new heyday in aviation, and air racing can again play a historical role in furthering our engineering ambitions, particularly in electric flight.

Q. How important is electric flight to the future of aviation?

Every day, this topic seems to be gaining more and more importance, whether in the industry, in the media or, frankly, to the ozone layer. The world is depending on Airbus and partnerships like ours to guide the aerospace industry onto a sustainable path for generations to come.

Q. Which milestones are you most looking forward to in 2020?

The first eight race teams are beginning to test their e-racers. This is momentous—eight new electric racing aircraft designs, eight new electric propulsion concepts, and eight new flying electric aircraft! We’ll also start training and testing the planes and pilots in race environments, so no rest in sight for innovation!

Jeff Zaltman is CEO of Air Race E, the world’s first all-electric air racing competition. He has worked professionally in the air sports industry for at least 15 years, primarily in air racing. He is recognised internationally as a pioneer in the sport and a world leader in the organisation of air racing events.

Bremen, 23 January 2020 – The Bartolomeo platform from Airbus gives new opportunities for research on the International Space Station (ISS). The European Space Agency ESA has now firmly booked a payload slot for a Norwegian instrument to monitor plasma density in the Earth's atmosphere.

The Bartolomeo platform - named after Christopher Columbus' younger brother - is currently in the final stage of launch preparation at Airbus in Bremen and is scheduled for launch to the ISS in March 2020. Bartolomeo is developed on a commercial basis by Airbus using its own investment funds and will be operated in cooperation with ESA.

The platform can accommodate up to 12 different experiment modules, supplying them with power and providing data transmission to Earth. Bartolomeo is suitable for many different experiments. Due to the unique position of the platform with a direct view of Earth from 400 kilometres, Earth observation including trace gas measurements or CO2 monitoring of the atmosphere are possible, with data useful for climate protection or for use by private data service providers.

The Multi-Needle Langmuir Probe (m-NLP) is an instrument from the University of Oslo and the Norwegian company Eidsvoll Electronics to measure ionospheric plasma densities. With its relatively low orbit, the ISS passes near the peak plasma density of the ionosphere. The m-NLP is currently the only instrument in the world capable of resolving ionospheric plasma density variations at spatial scales below one metre. It will gather valuable data from the equatorial and mid-latitude ionosphere, enabling study of the dynamic processes in this region in unprecedented detail. The Langmuir Probe will map plasma characteristics around the globe.

The mission is financed through the ESA PRODEX programme and supported by ESA’s Directorate Human & Robotic Exploration. The payload is scheduled to launch on ISS resupply flight NG-14 in October 2020 and will be the first payload to be installed on the Bartolomeo Platform outside the European Columbus Module.

Together with UNOOSA (United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs), Airbus is currently inviting tenders for further research opportunities on the platform, in particular to enable research institutions from developing countries to participate in scientific space research.

NASA places order for three Airbus H135 helicopters - Airbus,"Wed, 29 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMC0wMS1uYXNhLXBsYWNlcy1vcmRlci1mb3ItdGhyZWUtYWlyYnVzLWgxMzUtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The U.S. agency will use the aircraft for security during rocket launches, emergency medical services and qualified personnel transport.

Anaheim, 28 January 2020 – The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has placed an order for three H135 helicopters, marking the first-ever partnership between the U.S. space program and Airbus Helicopters. The order was announced today at the Airbus booth at the Heli Expo Trade show in Anaheim, California.

The H135s will be operated out of the Kennedy Space Center in Florida for a variety of missions, including rocket launches, security, emergency medical services, and passenger transport. Two of the helicopters are scheduled for delivery later this summer, with a third planned for early 2021.

“NASA chose the H135 because Airbus was able to meet all the NASA mission requirements which include personnel movements, airborne law enforcement roles, aerial firefighting, weapons training, and overwater operations,” said Dave Ramsey, NASA’s Chief of Flight Operations at the Kennedy Space Center. “The H135 provides a modernized airframe that performs well in the Florida environment and will serve to protect NASA assets and personnel for years to come.”

As part of a fleet replacement initiative, NASA will acquire the aircraft through Davenport Aviation, an SBA-certified woman-owned small business and HUBZone contractor specializing in the supply of aerospace equipment to federal, state and local government agencies.

“These new helicopters will help support NASA and the men and women who advance space exploration, scientific discovery and aeronautics research,” said Romain Trapp, President of Airbus Helicopters Inc. and Head of the North America region. “We look forward to partnering with NASA to provide them with the best products and services to complete their important mission.”

Airbus Helicopters says H160 certification imminent - Vertical Mag - Vertical Magazine,"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLXNheXMtaDE2MC1jZXJ0aWZpY2F0aW9uLWltbWluZW50L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters expects its latest cleansheet design, the H160 medium twin, will be certified over the coming weeks – almost five years after its first flight. As the approval will mark the start of a new phase in its sales effort, the airframer is putting emphasis on the reduced pilot workload in the H160’s flight deck.

Improving safety was a major aspect of the development. Airbus’s engineers made extensive use of incident and accident feedback and determined reducing the pilot’s workload was the way to go. “Fewer actions means fewer mistakes,” said experimental test pilot Olivier Gensse.

The approach could be seen right from the beginning of a flight on H160 prototype PT3. During a demonstration sortie this month at the company’s headquarters in Marignane, France, Gensse commented on the straightforward engine start procedure. “It takes two minutes from power-on to ‘ready to fly,’ ” he said.

An over-temperature situation would cause an automated shutdown. As the pilot does not have parameters to monitor while the engine is spooling up, he or she can look at the surroundings and check passengers are ready, Gensse points out.

Such progress was made possible thanks to the Helionix avionics suite, developed in house. “To be that simple for the pilot, the interface requires a complex system architecture,” said Gensse.

An engine failure has little impact on immediate workload – even on an offshore helipad. The system manages the sudden drop in power. If the engine failure takes place during takeoff before the decision point, the four-axis autopilot will bring the helicopter back to the spot it lifted off from (with a 0.5-meter precision). The pilot will only have to use the collective-pitch control to cushion the landing, said Gensse.

If the failure happens after the takeoff decision point, the autopilot will continue the takeoff.

An engine failure simulation mode makes training safer, as it does not involve shutting down or even idling one of the Safran Arrano engines.

The H160 also features a system to detect vortex ring state (VRS), an aerodynamic condition that causes the main rotor to sink. An aural and visual warning gives the crew a five- to seven-second notice, said Gensse. The system factors in the aircraft’s total energy, acceleration and deceleration.

As the autopilot prevents the aircraft from entering a VR, the detection system is useful when flying manually. “It took us years to achieve,” said Gensse. “The main challenge was to avoid false alarms.”

The automated recovery mode the H175 inaugurated can be found on the H160, too. Through a double push on a button, the pilot can order the aircraft to come back to the latest altitude, speed and heading in level flight. The system was tested at extreme angles – plus or minus 90 degrees in attitude and plus or minus 120 degrees in bank angle. “This is no magic, however – too late is too late,” said Gensse.

A number of flight systems come as standard, such as head-down synthetic vision, a weather radar, a digital map, TCAS 2 and HTAWS (the last two for collision and terrain avoidance, respectively).

Handling qualities have been the focus of intensive work to give the aircraft great stability. Aerodynamics were refined, such as by adding strakes on the vertical stabilizer. “Via the autopilot, we also worked a lot on decoupling control inputs,” said test pilot Nicolas Certain.

The result can be seen in extreme situations. “In case of an unexpected event such as a bird strike, the pilot sometimes pulls a control to the stop, which can cause a loss of control or break the airframe; on the H160, it can cause an abrupt change in trajectory but no loss of control or failure should be feared,” said Gensse.

The H160’s design engineers not only wanted the helicopter to be safe, they wanted the passenger to feel safe. Comfort participates in the feeling, they determined, and this was another reason to work on vibration and noise. The H160 is intrinsically quiet enough to avoid resorting to active noise and vibration suppression systems, which saved 90 to 100 pounds (40 to 50 kilograms), Gensse claimed.

Visibility should help, too. “Large windows prevent the passenger from feeling confined,” said Gensse. They also act as safety exits. Air conditioning is also standard on the H160.

Even the autopilot is expected to help reassure the passenger. “Whoever the pilot, the helicopter will behave the same way and the passenger will have the same feeling,” Gensse explained.

The last flight in the H160 certification program took place late last year. Airbus said European Aviation Safety Agency certification is hopefully imminent and the Federal Aviation Administration is expected to validate it within six months. A maturation program will continue after the approvals so the first delivery, to an unnamed U.S. customer, will happen in the second half.

In 2016, entry into service was still planned for 2018. But Airbus faced delays due to the redesign of some dynamic components.

“We also performed a weight-saving campaign and some long-lead items had to be adapted… and we spent a lot of time fine-tuning the aeromechanical profile,” said head of program Bernard Fujarski. Certification authorities and Airbus Helicopters have “raised the bar regarding safety standards and maturity requirements at entry into service,” he added."
"Airbus brings A321 production to Toulouse, replacing A380 work - PaxEx.Aero","Tue, 21 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vcGF4ZXguYWVyby9haXJidXMtYTMyMW5lby10b3Vsb3VzZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus A321LR/ACF test aircraft as unveiled in Hamburg (Image via Airbus)

Out with the A380, in with the A321neo. Airbus announced its intention to convert its A380 Lagardère facility in Toulouse to a final assembly line for the spectacularly popular and well-selling A321neo. The transition is expected to occur by mid-2022.

We are enjoying an unprecedented high demand for our winning A320neo Family and especially its A321 Long Range (LR) and Xtra Long Range (XLR) derivatives. In order to optimize the industrial flow, we have decided to increase our global A321 production capacity and flexibility as well as to establish a next generation Final Assembly Line in Toulouse. – Michael Schoellhorn, Airbus Chief Operating Officer

Airbus currently produces the A321 at its Finkenwerder plant in Hamburg and the Mobile, Alabama Final Assembly Line. Adding the Toulouse site expands the company’s capabilities on the A321neo, an important growth step as the larger model rakes in more and more orders across the globe. The legacy A320 lines in Toulouse were built too small to handle the longer A321 fuselage length. By expanding into the space vacated by the A380 production closing down Airbus makes optimal use of its infrastructure and keeps the production flow moving.

The move comes on the heels of the company announcing plans to increase its production rate in Mobile from 5 to 7 aircraft per month as of 2021. That move is part of an overall drive to build and deliver 63 A320neo family aircraft each month. But the new Toulouse line brings a different sort of growth. While the French site will soon be capable of building more sizes of the A320neo it will not build more planes on a regular basis. At least not yet. In its statement the airframer notes, “The new facilities will provide more flexibility for A321 production, while keeping the overall single aisle industrial capacity in Toulouse flat.”

Airbus cites overall competitiveness, time to market, investment cost, and available floor space and resources as the primary factors supporting the selection of Toulouse for the work.

Smoothing the A321neo flow

Increasing the production line space dedicated to the A321neo family should further aid Airbus in smoothing the overall build pace of the single-aisle family. While Airbus hit its overall delivery targets for 2019 the production rates are not smooth and airlines continue to face delays in receiving their contracted aircraft. FlightGlobal points out that more than 16% of the Airbus deliveries came in December, more than in December 2018 and similar to the 2016 number, while slightly trailing 2017.

Here’s how Airbus increases capacity on the A321neo through creative adjustment of exit locations

The revised forward section of the A321neo featuring the Airbus Cabin Flex design contributes to the build troubles as do engine suppliers. The number of “gliders” visible at the company production facilities remains impressive.

JetBlue was one of the loudest airlines talking about delivery delays. In mid-2019 the carrier slashed its expected delivery count for the type from 12 to 5, suspending retrofits of other aircraft to make up for the shortfall. More recently, JetBlue noted last week that the A321neo delays hampered growth plans and contributed to its decision for dropping a third of its flights from its Long Beach, CA focus city.

American Airlines similarly slipped five of its expected 2019 A321neo deliveries into 2020. Aer Lingus expected to have four LRs flying by the end of 2020 and came up short as well. It had only one available during the peak summer season, a hit to the carrier’s operations.

A new production line in Toulouse won’t necessarily solve the assembly challenges the A321neo faces, but it should help smooth the flow for Airbus.

It is also worth noting that this is not the first time A380 space has been allocated to helping production of other types. Airbus has used its A380 fuselage assembly station in Finkenwerder to support A321 and A350 backlogs in recent years as the A380 line work slowed.

Airbus to Convert A380 Production Line to Build A321neos - SamChui.com - Sam Chui,"Tue, 21 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vc2FtY2h1aS5jb20vMjAyMC8wMS8yMS9haXJidXMtdG8tY29udmVydC1hMzgwLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tbGluZS10by1idWlsZC1hMzIxbmVvcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has made the decision to convert A380 production facilities in Toulouse to support a new, highly-digital, A321neo production platform to support the large demand for the aircraft.

From 2022 the A380 production line will be equipped with a digitally-enabled production line, to modernise the existing A320 production system in Toulouse. Additionally the new facilities will allow Airbus to counter A321neo production snags, as a result of growing cabin offerings and extended range variants.

Airbus says that the new facilities will provide “more flexibility” for A321 production, though the amount of aircraft produced in Toulouse will remain flat.

In addition to the only European A321 production site being Hamburg Finkenwerder, Airbus also manufacturers the A321 in Mobile, Alabama in the United States of America. Toulouse was selected to accommodate the new production system due to its time to market, investment cost, available floor space and access to an existing supply network within Europe.

“We are enjoying an unprecedented high demand for our winning A320neo Family and especially its A321 Long Range (LR) and Xtra Long Range (XLR) derivatives. In order to optimise the industrial flow, we have decided to increase our global A321 production capacity and flexibility as well as to establish a next generation Final Assembly Line in Toulouse.” Michael Schoellhorn, Airbus Chief Operating Officer

The A320neo Family is the world’s best selling single-aisle aircraft, accumulating over 7,100 orders from over 110 customers around the world since its launch in 2010. Flight Global reports that the A321neo accounts for 45% of A320neo Family orders recorded by Airbus.

From 2023 Airbus will produce the A321XLR; which will provide airlines a range of 4,700 nautical miles and 30 percent lower fuel burn per seat, compared to the previous generation competitor aircraft.

To accommodate the longer flight times, Airbus has offered greater cabin configurations; including the Airbus Cabin Flex option, which has been responsible for the production snags at Hamburg Finkenwerder.

With the aim to iron out production hurdles, and to support the enormous demand for the A320neo Family, the decision to re-purpose the A380 line is viewed positively, especially with discussions about production rate increases in the future.

As part of the announcement, Airbus has informed its unions that the new site will be set up."
First impressions of Air Canada's brand-new Airbus A220 from its inaugural flight - The Points Guy,"Thu, 16 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2Fpci1jYW5hZGEtYTIyMC1pbmF1Z3VyYWwtZmxpZ2h0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus A220 is one of the most passenger-friendly jets in the sky. Rather excitingly, there's now a second carrier flying this new plane around North America besides Delta.

Air Canada took delivery of its first A220 a few weeks ago. After a month of testing and crew familiarization flights, the airline debuted the plane at a media event in a hangar in Montreal on Wednesday. And just one day later, Air Canada launched commercial service with the A220.

What follows is my experience onboard the inaugural flight from Montreal (YUL) to Calgary (YYC) on Thursday.

It was a big deal for Canada. This was the first scheduled flight of the flagship Canadian-made airliner with the Canadian flag carrier.

Gate celebration

With a departure scheduled for 8:10 a.m., you might not have expected such a cheery and energetic crowd. However, festivities were well underway when I got to Gate A11 about 90 minutes before boarding.

https://www.instagram.com/p/B7ZRuPdlqE8/

The inauguration ceremony began with short speeches by two executives who were very proud of the fact that the A220 was built just a few miles away in Mirabel. There was then a short photo shoot followed by a ceremonial ribbon cutting. (Before being renamed the Airbus A220 when the European company bought the program in 2018, the airplane was known as the Bombardier C-Series.)

At the conclusion, passengers were invited to partake in some themed cupcakes and soft drinks. Once everyone was satiated, it was time to get going. Boarding started on time (with some goodies), and it wasn't long before I heard the oohs and aahs of passengers marveling at the new plane. Air Canada flies the longer A220-300 variant; Delta chose the shorter A220-100, but has a bunch of -300s on order.

I couldn't imagine a better setting for an Air Canada inaugural than amid a snowstorm. But that meant the plane needed to be de-iced, which took quite some time. We were airborne an hour behind schedule, sans water-cannon salute.

Cabin overview

Air Canada's A220 is arranged in a standard two-cabin configuration. The forward cabin, called North America Business Class, features just 12 seats across three rows in a 2-2 layout.

The seats are quite comfortable and recline about four inches. Since the A220 will be flying some of the carrier's longest domestic and U.S. routes, you'll really appreciate that these seats have a legrest and footrest.

There's a small storage area located in the center armrest between seats. If you need more space, you'll find another exposed storage area above the seatback pocket.

The tray table pops out from the armrest and measures 18 inches wide and 10.5 inches long, which was plenty large for my 13-inch computer.

One of the best things about the A220 is the oversized overhead bins. The inaugural flight was completely full, yet no one was required to gate check their bag.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 2 A220 Overhead Bins 0 1

The economy cabin is quite comfortable as well, even though its outfitted with slimline seats.

The 125 seats are spread across 25 rows in a 2-3 layout. One of the best features of the A220 is the fact that it only has one middle seat per row.

Measuring 19 inches wide, these are the widest economy seats in Air Canada's fleet. Though an extra inch or two may not seem noticeable, I definitely felt a difference, especially around my shoulders.

Each seat offers about two and a half inches of recline.

Unfortunately, the armrests are incredibly narrow, and the ones on the aisle and window can't be raised or lowered.

The seatback pocket is the only storage space for these seats. I wish that Air Canada had installed more pockets or a tablet holder, like JetBlue did with the new Airbus A321neo.

The tray table measures 17 inches wide and 7.5 inches long. Though on the small side, it slides along its track for easy egress during flight.

As an AvGeek, my favorite feature of the A220 is the large windows. At 15 inches long and 10 inches wide, there's just so much room to capture the perfect Wingview Wednesday shot.

Overall, I thought the cabin was beautifully designed in understated tones. Biz class was really comfortable, and I particularly liked the legrest and footrest. And economy was about as good as economy gets.

Best seats on the Air Canada A220

Not all seats on this A220 are created equal.

If you're flying in business class, I'd definitely recommend choosing a seat in row 2 or 3, since the bulkhead row doesn't have a footrest.

If you're flying in economy, you should definitely select one of the A- or B-lettered coupled seats.

Regular economy seats have about 30 inches of pitch, which is on the tighter end, although what the slimline seats may take away in padding they give back in legroom, thanks to the narrow backs.

If you need more space, bulkhead Row 12 and Rows 19-21 are designated as Preferred seating. These have 34 inches of pitch, and about five more extra inches of legroom.

The exit row has a whopping 37 inches of legroom, but note that the window is much smaller than the rest of the cabin.

I'd personally also avoid the bulkhead, since there's no underseat storage and the armrests are immovable.

Amenities and IFE

Aside from the massive windows, the A220 is packed with top-notch amenities.

All seats feature a winged headrest which helped keep my neck in place when trying to sleep.

There are three average-sized lavatories on the plane. The one up front is reserved for those flying in business.

Each biz seat has a universal AC power outlet, but — contrary to the airline's press release — the outlets are shared in economy. There's one for the couple seats and two for the three seats on the other side.

If you need more juice, there's a standard USB port and a USB-C port at every seat.

As an unapologetic techie, I loved that Air Canada installed USB-C rapid charging on this plane. With Apple and other companies migrating to this new adapter, passengers won't need to carry a dongle to charge their devices.

Every seat is equipped with an HD personal entertainment system loaded with over 1,000 hours of movies and TV shows. Those up front measure 13 inches, while the economy ones are 10 inches.

I was very impressed with the software installed on the IFE system. The touchscreen and animations moved very smoothly, and there was a wealth of information on the screens, including weather, inflight menu and flight connection information.

The system also has some nifty features like night mode that changes the display to warmer colors, making it easier on your eyes.

Furthermore, there's a picture-in-picture mode which you can use to minimize your content while browsing the system.

If you're looking to stay connected, the A220 is outfitted with the latest Gogo 2Ku Wi-Fi system. There was a choice of two plans: a slower browse package and a faster stream plan. Prices for the browse and stream packages were 8.50 CAD ($6.52) and 12.25 CAD ($9.39) for one hour or 13.50 CAD ($10.35) and 21.50 CAD ($16.48) for the full flight, respectively.

I selected the full-flight stream package and was wowed by the 50 Mbps download speeds. The upload speeds, however, were a lot less impressive at 2 Mbps.

Overall impression

Though we had a departure delay, the inaugural flight quite literally flew by.

For those booked on the new plane, you'll enjoy your flight — regardless of whether you're sitting in biz or coach. The front cabin was particularly comfortable, especially with the added legrest and footrest. In economy, the seats were noticeably wider, plus there's only one middle seat per row.

Aside from the seats, there's a slew of useful inflight amenities, like a USB-C charging port, large overhead bins and high-speed Wi-Fi.

All in all, the Air Canada A220 is a joy to fly. I can't wait until more of these sleek jets grace the North American skies.

Airbus to pay record £3bn in fines for 'endemic' corruption - The Guardian,"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIwL2phbi8zMS9haXJidXMtdG8tcGF5LXJlY29yZC0zYm4taW4tZmluZXMtZm9yLWVuZGVtaWMtY29ycnVwdGlvbtIBaWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIwL2phbi8zMS9haXJidXMtdG8tcGF5LXJlY29yZC0zYm4taW4tZmluZXMtZm9yLWVuZGVtaWMtY29ycnVwdGlvbg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus, Europe’s largest aerospace multinational, is to pay a record £3bn in penalties after admitting it had paid huge bribes on an “endemic” basis to land contracts in 20 countries.

Anti-corruption investigators hailed the result as the largest ever corporate fine for bribery in the world after judges declared that the corruption was “grave, pervasive and pernicious”.

The planemaker agreed to pay the penalties on Friday after reaching settlements with investigators in the UK, France and the US to end inquiries that started four years ago.

In the high court in London, Dame Victoria Sharp, the President of the Queen’s Bench Division, approved the settlement struck with the UK’s Serious Fraud Office (SFO).

She said: “The seriousness of the criminality in this case hardly needs to be spelled out. As is acknowledged on all sides, it was grave.”

She added that the scale of the wrongdoing demonstrated that bribery was “endemic in two core business areas within Airbus”.

Allison Clare, for the SFO, told the court the company had paid bribes in Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Taiwan and Ghana between 2011 and 2015.

Airbus, which admitted five counts of failing to prevent bribery, had used a network of secret agents to pay large-scale backhanders to officials in foreign countries to land high-value contracts.

This was run by a unit at its French headquarters, which its one-time chief executive Tom Enders reportedly called “bullshit castle”.

French prosecutors examined bribes to other countries including China, Japan, Russia, Kuwait, Brazil and Turkey.

Hugo Keith, for Airbus, said the settlement will “draw a line under the investigation and the grave historical practices” exposed by prosecutors.

Airbus hopes the settlements, approved by courts in the three countries, will end turbulence within its management which had led to scores of senior executives being sacked. The firm is one of the largest employers in the UK, with a workforce of 13,500.

The penalties will be paid to the governments of the three countries that investigated Airbus, with £1.7bn going to France and £820m going to the UK Treasury.

The settlement surpasses the previous UK record for a corporate fine for bribery – the £671m paid by Rolls-Royce, Britain’s leading multinational manufacturer, in 2017.

Under the deal, known as a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA), Airbus will pay the penalties and promise to mend its ways. In return, any prosecution of the firm as a corporation will be suspended for three years.

Clare told the court the SFO was still considering whether to prosecute individuals involved in the bribery.

Sue Hawley, the executive director of Spotlight on Corruption, said:“Airbus’s egregious bribery around the world has rightly attracted the largest corporate fine for bribery in history. But this fine will ring extremely hollow if prosecutions of those responsible from Airbus senior management at the time of the wrongdoing do not follow.”

The SFO started its investigation in 2016 after evidence emerged of “irregularities” involving Airbus’s secret agents. The French and American investigations started later.

The US settlement was approved in Washington by District Judge Thomas Hogan, who said: “It was a pervasive and pernicious bribery scheme in various divisions of Airbus SE that went on for a number of years.”

Airbus also admitted violations of US export controls.

However, Friday’s deal left unanswered the fate of the SFO’s investigation into Airbus’s UK-based subsidiary, GPT Special Project Management, which allegedly paid bribes of at least £14m to win Saudi Arabian contracts.

The British government has taken at least 18 months to decide whether to approve the SFO’s request to start prosecutions over the GPT allegations.

In another aspect of the alleged corruption, Airbus started an internal investigation in 2017 after the Guardian uncovered a series of questionable financial transactions in hundreds of leaked bank records and internal memos."

ENTZ called for foiling mono-hulls. While these are technically single-hull boats, they are the only ones in the world without keels. Instead, foils and rudders are used for ballast and stability.

The boats are designed to a box rule that requires some of the components like length, beam, draft and sail structures to fall within specific parameters. Other components of the boat, like the mast and aspects of the foil, must be exactly as specified. Finally, some features, like the hull design and additional foil designs, can be unique.

The team’s boat, Defiant, has been designed with the help of aeronautical engineers from Airbus. Since Defiant will foil at 50mph, it doesn’t hurt to have a team of flying experts.

As one old salt put it, “When reading about the technical achievements of all four boats, it helps to have degrees in both mechanical engineering and advanced computational dynamics.” The science behind these foiling masterpieces is at the Space X level.

Here is the current status of the boats in the water:

American Magic

The American team, headed by sailing legend, Skipper and Executive Director Terry Hutchinson, have left the cold clime of Narragansett Bay, R.I., and are currently skimming the waters off their winter base in Pensacola, Fla.

Defiant was built in the old stomping grounds of past America’s Cup boats; Bristol, R.I., home of the legendary Herreshoff Manufacturing Company. As Terry Hutchinson told Worth, “We are extremely proud that we built this boat in Bristol, home to so many of the great AC boats of the past. Part of our mission is to help revitalize marine trades in America. For example, we built the spars in Michigan.”

Construction took place under military-type security. When I approached the build shed (in a very unassuming industrial park) last summer for a look-see, I was politely but firmly asked to move on. I might have been a spy for another team.

American Magic is counting on a series of innovations to make the boat fast. First may be the hull. In order to get the boat up and out of the water, i.e., to make it as “slippery” as possible, the fit and finish are at the micro-precision level.

There is a lot of firepower behind the American Magic Challenge. Aside from the backing of the NYYC, which held the trophy for 132 years before losing it in 1983, three Team Principals founded and led the team. Sailing World Champions Hap Fauth and Doug DeVos joined motorsports icon Roger Penske to form American Magic shortly after the last America’s Cup was won by Emirates Team New Zealand in 2017. The team now has a staff of 140. Terry added, “I am happy at where we are now. We met all our design, build and crew goals. Defiant is doing well. The real test, however, is in April in Sardinia, when we race the other boats for the first time at the America’s Cup World Series, a promotional regatta. That will determine how happy we really are.”

Three America’s Cup World Series regattas will take place in Europe and New Zealand in 2020, followed by the Prada Cup (the Challenger finals) and the 36th America’s Cup in March 2021 in Auckland.

The bottom line is that the American Magic challenge is formidable. Everything about Defiant says “competitive.” Real Yankee engineering, with a continental touch of Airbus technology, may be unstoppable.

Luna Rossa Prada Pirelli Team

The Italians claim responsibility for finding America. After all it was Italian navigator Columbus who risked all on the then-unknown high seas. The Italians are at it again, with a combination of some serious euros in financing, high style from Prada and super-high-tech engineering from global industrial giant Pirelli. Their boat Luna Rossa is a serious contender. Worth caught up with the rather elegant Marco Crola, North American CEO of Pirelli, at the Prada party in Newport last summer. His take was, “This effort is about visibility for our technology. We are contributing a lot of the key parts of the boat. Since Pirelli often wins on asphalt, it was logical to take those successes to the water. When you combine that with the Prada luxury connection, we hope to win the 36th Cup as our brands win in the consumer market.”

INEOS Team UK

This is a reconstituted Sir Ben Ainslie Racing (BAR) effort. His performance was, frankly, underwhelming at the 35th Cup. They were eliminated early on. From what I saw in Bermuda, the BAR-Land Rover effort came up short in both sailing skills and technology. However, and this is a big however, Sir Ben has teamed up with another “Sir” in the person of Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Britain’s richest man, to fund his challenge. According to reports, Sir Jim told Sir Ben, “Do it right.” He is hoping the $150 million pounds he put into the challenge boat Britannia can accomplish that goal. Britannia is by far the most radical of the boat designs. Her wide hull and long smooth curves make it look like it could skim over the water like a polished stone.

The Defenders: ETNZ

Te Aihe means “Dolphin” in Maori. One very knowledgeable observer thinks, “This is the boat to beat.” For one thing, the event will be held in the Auckland Gulf, their home waters, known for fickle winds. Another advantage is they issued all the design specifications. Theoretically they knew what they wanted. It did, however, capsize in a recent trial. No one was hurt and the boat was righted.

ETNZ, coming off their win in Bermuda, has a tight team. They were full of surprises there, winning in a stunning upset. Can they fend off the new, very well-funded challengers?

We will find out when they first sail against each other in Cagliari Sardinia April 23-26."

Bristow cancels 22 H175 order with Airbus - Helicopter Investor,"Wed, 08 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlbGljb3B0ZXJpbnZlc3Rvci5jb20vbmV3cy85NTQ2Ny9icmlzdG93LWNhbmNlbHMtMjItaDE3NS1vcmRlci13aXRoLWFpcmJ1cy00OTgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bristow cancels 22 H175 order with Airbus

news by Alasdair Whyte 8 January 2020 Print this page

UPDATE: Airbus has since dismissed claims that the 22 H175s cancelled represent half of the model types order backlog.

Bristow Group has cancelled a long-standing order for 22 H175s with Airbus Helicopters – which is thought to be more than half of Airbus’s total H175 order backlog, according to sources familiar with the matter.

Bristow’s cancellation of the order was approved in the Houston Bankruptcy Courts during its Chapter 11 protection process, from which it emerged from in early November. The order cancellation was revealed in Bristow’s latest 10-Q finance update it submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The helicopter operator was one of the first to commit to purchasing the H175s, ordering five of the aircraft in 2013. It more than tripled the order to 17 in March 2015, with deliveries scheduled to start in October 2016. The operator decided to add a further five aircraft to the backlog in 2017.

During the early stages of Bristow’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection process in May last year, both Bristow and Airbus agreed to postpone the delivery of the 22 helicopters for 18 months, with the first delivery of three helicopters postponed until 2022 – according to the 10-Q form.

According to a Bristow spokesperson, the company has no H175s in its fleet today.

Court approval

This resulted in a deferral of around $110m, originally scheduled for payment to Airbus between 2019-2023 into 2024 and beyond. The price of the helicopters also increased by $18.4m to account for inflation.

But in September, Bristow asked the bankruptcy court to approve the cancellation of the purchase agreement, which was approved by the court on October 3rd. None of the 22 aircraft have been delivered, Airbus told Helicopter Investor.

‘A Blow to Airbus’

Alastair Fallon, helicopter aviation analyst at IBA Group, told Helicopter Investor: “It is certainly a blow to Airbus to have such a large order cancelled. They are going to have to find others to take the aircraft depending on what stage along the development [path] the helicopters are.

“If they have other H175 orders on the backlog, some of those customers may be getting their helicopters a little earlier if they are able to take them. 22 is a big number considering the H175 backlog.”

Airbus told Helicopter Investor 40 H175s are currently in service, including a number of Airbus Corporate Helicopter ACH175s. Aircraft lessor LCI received the first H175 in March 2018, placing it with fellow offshore operator CHC.

Regarding the court decision, an Airbus spokesperson said: “We do not comment on commercial discussions with our customers.”

Airbus resolves global bribery scandal for record $4B - Compliance Week,"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbXBsaWFuY2V3ZWVrLmNvbS9hbnRpLWJyaWJlcnkvYWlyYnVzLXJlc29sdmVzLWdsb2JhbC1icmliZXJ5LXNjYW5kYWwtZm9yLXJlY29yZC00Yi8yODM4Ny5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"European plane maker Airbus will avoid criminal prosecution after agreeing to pay a total of €3.6 billion (U.S. $4 billion) in penalties to prosecutors in the United States, United Kingdom, and France over an “endemic” bribery scandal that saw the company pay bribes to win contracts in 20 countries around the world.

The total is the world’s largest global resolution for bribery.

The company, which admitted five counts of failing to prevent bribery, had used a network of secret agents to pay large-scale bribes to officials in foreign countries to land high-value contracts between 2011 and 2015.

Under the terms of the deferred prosecution agreement (DPA), Airbus—the world’s second-largest airplane manufacturer—will pay a fine and costs amounting to €991 million (U.S. $1.1 billion) to the U.K.’s Serious Fraud Office, while France’s Parquet National Financier (PNF) will receive close to €2.1 billion (U.S. $2.33 billion). The U.S. Department of Justice and Department of State will get €525.6 million (U.S. $583 million) from Airbus for violations under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).

The DPA—the seventh finalized by the SFO since it came into effect in 2013—was approved by courts in all three countries Friday and will be in force until Jan. 31, 2023.

The settlement surpasses the £671 million (U.S. $886 million) paid by engine maker Rolls-Royce in 2017, which was the previous U.K. record for a corporate fine for bribery, and amounts to more than half of the £1.53 billion (U.S. $2 billion) total raised through the SFO’s DPAs.

Compliance details of the DPA 1. Airbus must agree to “substantial remediation” and “ongoing improvements” to its group-wide ethics and compliance policies and procedures. The Airbus “Compliance Journey” has comprised a comprehensive set of initiatives to change Airbus’ culture and strengthen the group’s assurance activities and operating practices in recruitment, risk management and controls. Key components have included: the replacement of senior management at Executive Committee level, including appointment of a new CEO, CFO, and general counsel;

creating a subcommittee of the board, titled the Ethics & Compliance Committee, to provide independent oversight of the company’s Ethics & Compliance program;

the extensive recruitment of external compliance professionals with direct access to the board and Executive Committee through the general counsel and the new chief ethics & compliance officer;

revising Airbus’ Code of Conduct and other principles, supported by extensive training;

strengthening risk management, compliance, and internal escalation processes;

strengthening contractual-credit governance;

the prohibition on the use of external consultants in any commercial aircraft sales campaign; and

overhauling its systems and approach to financial controls, including a “First and Second line of Defence” with robust reporting embedded in routine operations and the consistent application of standards. 2. Airbus shall cooperate fully and honestly with all SFO pre-investigations, investigations, and prosecutions during the term of the agreement. 3. At the request of the SFO, Airbus shall also cooperate fully and honestly with any other domestic or foreign law enforcement and regulatory authorities and agencies in any investigation or prosecution of any of its present or former officers, directors, employees, agents, and consultants, or any third party. Source: Airbus deferred prosecution agreement (DPA)

The SFO opened investigations into Airbus in 2016 after the firm self-reported incidents of alleged bribery and asked regulators to look at documentation about its use of overseas agents. The French and U.S. investigations started later.

“Airbus’ commitment to transparency with the US authorities and implementation of a comprehensive remediation plan was a cornerstone of this resolution,” said John Barker, a partner in the national security practice at law firm Arnold & Porter’s, which will assist Airbus on implementation of the consent agreement with the U.S. Department of State. “Companies throughout industry should take note that the settlement recognizes the value of identifying and bringing forward compliance issues and working with government authorities to resolve them to establish a solid foundation for future export licensing and compliance.”

It is unclear whether the SFO or U.S. and French prosecutors will attempt to go after the intermediaries who helped pay the bribes to secure contracts. Lawyers suggest this is unlikely.

In her judgment, Dame Victoria Sharp called Airbus’ conduct “grave,” adding “the seriousness of the criminality in this case hardly needs to be spelled out.”

Lisa Osofsky, SFO director, said in a statement: “Airbus paid bribes through agents around the world to stack the decks in its favour and win contracts around the globe. Corruption like this undermines free trade and fair development and it is to Airbus’ credit it has admitted its culpability, cleaned its house and come forward to put this conduct to bed.”

Reading into why Airbus got a DPA

Lawyers believe the DPA marks a “victory on both sides.” Craig Weston, a senior associate in law firm Irwin Mitchell’s regulatory investigations group, says the DPA “represents the end of a long-running saga for Airbus and will be able to provide certainty for their shareholders and allow the company to move forward with their business.”

Lawyers say each DPA gives a little bit of a better insight into what the SFO considers and is looking for when deciding to agree to a DPA. Airbus would have already had to demonstrate it had made compliance improvements as part of the DPA negotiation process.

Ian Ryan, partner and head of business crime at law firm Howard Kennedy, says “this DPA will probably be seen as a victory for both sides. The SFO will provide the treasury with a large windfall and demonstrate that they are able to deal with the most complex of investigations, and Airbus will be able to put this matter behind them and move on. Their share price increased following the announcement that a deal had been struck.”

Ryan says the main lesson for companies to learn is if they or their intermediaries engage in bribery and corruption, they are likely to be hit economically, and it will affect their shareholders.

“Companies will need to have a close look at the DPA judgement to see exactly the level of cooperation and remedial action Airbus was able to demonstrate to the SFO, which enabled the agency to feel comfortable to enter into this DPA. Companies would be wise to then review their own compliance policies and procedures to ensure they remain adequate and effective,” says Ryan.

Aziz Rahman, senior partner at business crime law firm Rahman Ravelli, says “no doubt those at Airbus will rest easy if its past and present personnel enjoy the same outcome” as other executives who were charged but not convicted while their companies qualified for DPAs.

But he adds Airbus has shown compliance and cooperation are key to being considered for leniency. “The firm has certainly attempted to do all it can to achieve a DPA: Senior executives have been removed, its ethics and compliance procedures have been reviewed and revised, and it has reduced the number of third parties it uses in deals. The Airbus board has decided there were benefits to be had from doing all it can to show it is now a ‘new’ company with few links to the wrongdoing that has caused it such problems,” he says.

While Airbus is immune from prosecution (so long as it did not lie or withhold evidence throughout the investigation and continues to cooperate), the SFO says the investigation remains “active” and it may consider criminal prosecutions against individuals—a touchy issue for the agency. To date, the SFO has failed to secure a conviction against any individuals involved in any of the previous bribery and corruption cases where companies have helped supply evidence against former directors and others to secure leniency under each of the six other DPAs.

Lawyers suggest the SFO will “proceed with caution.”

“The SFO has come out bruised from its last two attempts to prosecute individuals in the U.K. following DPAs, and I suspect the agency would proceed with caution to prosecute the individuals in the U.K.,” says Weston.

Iskander Fernandez, head of white collar crime and investigations at law firm BLM, believes the SFO will be “itching” to secure its first convictions of individuals alongside its seventh DPA, but believes the agency will “not rush into anything.”

“The SFO has a poor track record in trying to hold individuals to account, and after previous disappointments it will certainly think twice before it seeks prosecutions again,” he says"

Airbus surpasses Boeing to become the world's leading aircraft manufacturer - Aerospace Technology,"Wed, 08 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm9zcGFjZS10ZWNobm9sb2d5LmNvbS9jb21tZW50L2FpcmJ1cy1ib2VpbmctYWlyY3JhZnQtdG9wL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With 863 airplanes delivered and the 1,000 orders mark exceeded, 2019 proved to be positive for the European aerospace corporation, which will work at full capacity for the years to come.

Airbus is now the new leading global aircraft manufacturer following the issues encountered by its main competitor, Boeing.

Now, Airbus must strengthen its leading position by ensuring that it can cope with the increased demand and avoid technical problems on its aircraft. However, doing so will not be easy and the European plane manufacturer is not without problems.



Airlines turn to the A320 for their single-aisle needs

The multiple construction issues suffered by the single-aisle 737 MAX, and the subsequent interruption of its production by Boeing, has put the plane manufacturer in a difficult commercial position.

Indeed, the company only managed to deliver slightly more than 350 aircraft in 2019, less than half of the number recorded by Airbus, and half as much as the year before. Some Boeing clients have decided to turn to Airbus instead of waiting for the situation to be solved.

As a result, Airbus’ main single-aisle aircraft, the A320, has become the best-selling model in history, beating the 737, and the manufacturer’s order books are now full until 2024.

Good results have allowed Airbus to overtake Boeing for the first time since 2011. This provides Airbus with a key competitive advantage as the only real competition remains Boeing. Other civil aircraft manufacturers do not have the same global reach as these two.

Some serious challenges make this leading position fragile

The main challenge for Airbus now is to improve its delivery capacities to respond to the increased demand. Indeed, a number of clients have already complained about production delays in 2019. Accepting new contracts from disgruntled Boeing clients might exacerbate this problem. Some of these delays are also caused by the discovery of stability issues on the A320 neo, which will have to be solved quickly if the manufacturer wants to maintain its leading position.

The European company is now planning to hire a total of 5,000 new employees on its sites across the world in 2020, which should improve the supply chain and prevent any potential delays caused by these technical issues. Looking ahead, the manufacturer is also abandoning the supersized A380 model to focus on the development of more environmentally friendly aircraft, an increasingly important issue for passengers and, consequently, for airlines. This could help Airbus gain a competitive edge in the future if these models prove to be efficient enough and if Boeing fails to invest in them due to the financial hit caused by the 737 MAX issues.

The A220 is known as being a passenger-pleasing aircraft due to multiple factors, including roomy overhead bins, large windows, a 2-3 configuration in economy class (meaning more passengers have a chance to snag a window or an aisle seat) and wider seats in economy due to the aircraft’s cross-section.

That last bit is really important to me. I am 5ft 4in tall and wear a pant size 24. Legroom in economy is rarely a problem, but when it comes to seat width, I’m the gal who worries if the seatbelt will fit without an extender, or if my thigh will encroach on a seat mate’s living space.

Air Canada’s A220 features two cabins – 12 seats in business class in a 2-2- layout, and 125 seats in economy class, with the latter measuring a glorious 19 inches of width each (slimline armrests apparently aided this achievement).

For comparison purposes, the standard seat size on the Boeing 737 is 17 inches, and on the Airbus A320 is 18 inches. A 19-inch width is akin to what is found on many premium economy class seats.

During my tour of the A220, I tested the seatbelts in both business and economy. They fit around my waist. Phew. Seatbelts aren’t standardized so one never knows.

Seat pitch, however, was a snug 30 inches in the regular economy class seats aboard Air Canada’s A220.

Interestingly, legroom at the bulkhead seat in business class also seemed a tad constrained (not unlike the situation observed on Delta’s new A220). Indeed, when I stretched out at the bulkhead seat, my toes touched the structure. Like Delta’s A220, Air Canada’s A220 would benefit from a cut-out for passengers’ feet.

If you’re tall, I’d recommend opting for rows 2 or 3 in business class, or the extra-legroom Preferred Seats in economy (the green seats on SeatGuru’s handy map). I had significantly more legroom in the first row of economy class (which are Preferred Seats) than I did at the bulkhead seat in business as seen in the photo above; yes, the left photo is of business class.

Bolstering the overall “premium” feel of this aircraft are sparkling new inflight entertainment systems at every seat, including 12-inch displays in economy class.

Air Canada has long been committed to providing passengers with seatback IFE, even on its large regional jets. And its decision to honor that heritage on the A220-300 is most appreciated indeed.

After all, IFE is not just a nice-to-have. It can serve as a distraction for passengers who are anxious flyers or feel uncomfortable in confined spaces.

The Panasonic Avionics eX1 system is more inclusive than some of Air Canada’s older embedded IFE systems, boasting 15 languages, closed captioning for the deaf and hard of hearing, and accessibility for visually-impaired passengers.

It’s great to see airlines like Air Canada take the initiative to ensure accessible IFE for passengers.

USB charging ports can be found at every IFE screen. And 110v power is on offer, attached to the seat leg in front (so be prepared to crouch down a bit). The high-speed Internet is powered by Gogo 2Ku satellite-based connectivity.

All seats on board the Air Canada A220 are provided by Collins Aerospace, an Air Canada spokesperson confirmed to me. Collins also provides the avionics for the A220, giving it profound nose-to-tail content on this new twinjet. New deliveries will replace Air Canada’s Embraer 190 fleet.

As you can see, there are notable #PaxEx pluses on Air Canada’s A220-300, and the carrier overall should be lauded for its efforts. But I was disappointed by one facet.

The two small lavatories at the back of the aircraft were a very tight fit for me. So much so that I had to turn sideways to enter the door. And once inside, it was nearly impossible to maneuver around.

These two lavs can be modified to accommodate passengers with reduced mobility – an inner door opens up between them. But you still need to be able to squeeze into the front door of one of the lavs to use this functionality.

If I was even an inch larger, I simply wouldn’t fit through the door, and wouldn’t be able to use the bathroom. So if you’re a larger passenger booking the A220 because of its larger seats in economy class, you might be surprised that the economy lavs don’t share this design ethos.

An interesting design note for parents – the lavs feature changing tables which are shaped like a shallow bowl to effectively cup the child for added safety. However, here again, the lack of space in the lav is a concern, as I am certain that a plus-sized mother would have very limited ability to move when the table is pulled out.

Overall, the aircraft is impressive. And I was not alone in feeling some homegrown Canadian pride in Air Canada’s big reveal, and the fact that it is the first North American operator to fly the A220-300 series. Delta launched the A220-100.

Indeed, Air Canada CEO Calin Rovinescu noted that the airline’s order for the A220 – when it was known as the C Series – was made “at a crucial juncture in the aircraft’s history”.

He said: “As the first North American carrier to place a firm order, we helped put the program on solid footing encouraging other global carriers to have confidence in placing orders that the aircraft model would survive. In this way we feel … we are proud that we played an important role in keeping Canada on [the] leading edge of innovation in the aerospace industry, which is certainly where the A220 places Canada.”

Air Canada yesterday launched its first A220-300 revenue flight, from Montreal to Calgary. The aircraft is set to operate between Montreal and Seattle, and between Toronto and San Jose, California starting 4 May 2020.
