During its last Board of Directors meeting on 17th December, the Airbus Corporate Foundation appointed Fabrice Brégier, Airbus President and CEO, as its new Chairman of the Board, succeeding Tom Enders, CEO of EADS, who headed the Foundation since its creation in 2008 and who has been appointed Honorary Chairman of the Foundation.“I am thrilled to take over this great mission to head the Airbus Corporate Foundation. I will continue to work hand in hand with our Airbus employees as well as with our partner airlines and organisations in order to take the Foundation further”, said Fabrice Brégier. “With a strong footing on the Foundation’s humanitarian and environmental objectives, the organisation will now focus more on local initiatives in Airbus home countries, especially ones that help young people from difficult areas”.Social responsibility coupled with a greater will to take care of the environment has been at the heart of Airbus’ business activities for a long time. From its beginning, the Airbus Corporate Foundation’s Board of Directors secured the support of international external members who brought in experience and know-how in their respective fields of expertise.The Airbus Corporate Foundation aims at facilitating charitable activities worldwide within an international network of employees and partners by focussing its support on three themes: Humanitarian and community support, Youth development and the Environment.The first theme of the Foundation is to provide aid and relief in cases of natural disaster and reaching out to develop local communities where Airbus is present. Airbus has built up a global network of airlines and relief organisations to support international humanitarian aid missions such as transporting food and goods to areas of need on aircraft being delivered to customer airlines. Since its launch, the Airbus Corporate Foundation has facilitated 30 relief flights to numerous destinations all over the globe.Projects to inspire youth launched through the Airbus Foundation have successfully run in Airbus’ home four countries and around the globe, reaching over 30,000 young people over the last four to five years. The “Flying Challenge” – programme that supports high school students from underprivileged neighbourhoods in completing their scholastic studies - was successfully rolled out in Toulouse and the US and will be expanded to the UK, Spain and Germany in 2013.In the field of Environment, the Foundation focuses on protecting, improving and increasing awareness of the environment, and supporting projects with a particular focus on biodiversity. In 2010, the Foundation launched a Biodiversity Program enabling selected Airbus employees to make a significant difference in the environment and the lives of a local Indian community and upon their return, closer to home, to share their unique experience with their managers and colleagues as well as with local youth. In 2011, the Foundation also launched local projects to increase biodiversity awareness among youth in France, Spain, the UK and Germany in local communities.More information on the Airbus Corporate Foundation","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.996446430683136}",positive,0.996446430683136,1
Turkey Spurns Boeing To Fill Its Biggest Plane Order Ever - Business Insider,"Sat, 22 Dec 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vdHVya2V5LWNob29zZXMtYWlyYnVzLW92ZXItYm9laW5nLXRvLWZpbGwtdGhlaXItYmlnZ2VzdC1wbGFuZS1vcmRlci1ldmVyLTIwMTItMTLSAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL3R1cmtleS1jaG9vc2VzLWFpcmJ1cy1vdmVyLWJvZWluZy10by1maWxsLXRoZWlyLWJpZ2dlc3QtcGxhbmUtb3JkZXItZXZlci0yMDEyLTEyP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"THOUGH clearly not welcome news for Boeing, the decision by one of its former customers Pegasus, Turkey's fast-expanding low-cost carrier, to select the Airbus A320neo for its fleet renewal (and spurn the Boeing 737 MAX) will be neither surprising nor unduly alarming. True, Airbus has notched up 1,654 firm orders for the neo against 969 for the MAX. But Airbus had a nine-month head-start with its next-generation narrow-body aircraft. Looking at total orders across all types, Boeing is on track to outsell Airbus this year: the first time it has done so since 2006.

What is more interesting is the size of Pegasus's commitment—100 aircraft, comprising firm orders for 58 A320neos and 17 larger A321neos, plus 25 options. The airline's chairman, Ali Sabanci, describes it as ""the biggest order in the history of Turkish civil aviation"", which is no mean feat given the spending spree Turkey's flag-carrier has also embarked on. Turkish Airlines ordered 30 wide-body aircraft in October—15 Airbus A330s and 15 Boeing 777s—and it is already dropping hints of Airbus A380 or Boeing 747-8 orders to come. Not content with their respective fleets of 42 and 200 aircraft, Turkey's big two airlines have dreams of turning Istanbul into a mega-hub capable of rivalling the Gulf neighbours.

Going head-to-head with Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), two countries that have placed aviation at the heart of their economic development and have seemingly bottomless pockets to fund their strategies, may seem risky. But Turkey has some advantages. Istanbul is within four hours' flying time of most of western Europe, the world's largest market for international travel, as well as being equidistant from much of the Middle East, North Africa and central Asia. This allows Pegasus and Turkish Airlines to deploy smaller narrow-body planes from their hubs, affording greater flexibility for route planning than is enjoyed by the widebody-operators of the Gulf. Turkey's size also gives it a strong home market, guaranteeing buoyant domestic demand.

Having secured strong growth at home and in western Europe since relaunching as a low-cost carrier in 2005, Pegasus is now increasingly looking to new markets in eastern Europe and central Asia. The strategy is underscored by the recent launch of services from its base at Istanbul Sabiha Gökçen airport to Lviv in Ukraine and Batumi in Georgia. However, while Mr Sabanci says his new fleet will facilitate further growth in under-served markets, he accepts that archaic bilateral restrictions and costly travel visas pose challenges in Pegasus's target markets.

For Turkish Airlines, Africa is the obvious region for growth. The carrier already flies to 33 destinations on the continent, often with narrow-body jets deployed on low-frequency services, which can easily be scaled up or down to match shifting demand. This autumn's spate of airline start-ups in Africa—centring on Fastjet in the east and Gambia Bird in the west—is a sign of confidence in the continent’s rising economic fortunes. As more Africans take to the skies, Turkish Airlines is hopeful of hoovering up intercontinental traffic and routing it via Istanbul Atatürk airport. The company's latest traffic report—which, for the first nine months of the year, recorded 27% traffic growth coupled with a 46% increase in international transfer passengers—suggests it is doing a good job.

There are familiar pitfalls, of course. Competition from the Gulf in particular remains fierce. Not only are Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways heaping capacity on western European and African routes, but the UAE's low-cost carriers, flydubai and Air Arabia, are both turning their focus to eastern Europe and central Asia. More than 40% of flydubai's growth in 2012 has honed in on these regions. Furthermore, questions persist about Istanbul's planned 120m-capacity third airport, to be located in the European side of the city near the Black Sea coast. The five-runway hub is intended to accommodate Turkish Airlines' growth for decades to come. But it has barely progressed beyond the blueprint stage, and Turkey's government, though decidedly pro-aviation, cannot hope to match the blank cheques being signed in the Gulf.

Another concern is the Gulf carriers' newfound appetite for consolidation, a departure from their traditional focus on organic growth. The past few months have seen Emirates team up with Qantas, Qatar with oneworld, and Etihad with Air France-KLM. In response, a ""joint management"" agreement between Turkish Airlines and Germany's Lufthansa is being openly mooted by the leaders of Turkey and Germany, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Angela Merkel. While the strategic merit of such a deal is open for debate, continued expansion in Turkey, with or without foreign help, seems all but certain. Both Airbus and Boeing can be confident of more Turkish delights in the years ahead.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.999934196472168}",positive,0.999934196472168,1

The deal is the second large order for Airbus within two weeks.

The contract signed by China Southern Airlines was for ten new Airbus A330-300 aircraft, China's largest airline said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange Wednesday.

According to the European plane maker's price list, the deal would be worth $1.88 billion (1.43 billion euros), but China Southern Airlines said it was granted ""certain price concessions"" from Airbus.

Noting that the order would be financed through international funding and bank loans, the airline said it was expecting delivery of the first aircraft to begin between 2014 and 2016.

China Southern Airlines also said the order would boost the carrier's current capacity by 5.7 percent and enhance its competitiveness in the rapidly expanding Chinese travel market.

The deal came just two weeks after Airbus secured another major order from smaller airline, China Eastern Airlines. The Shanghai-based carrier bought 60 Airbus 320s in a deal reportedly worth $5.39 billion.

According to latest Airbus figures, the European plane-making consortium had 853 aircraft in service in China by the end of October, accounting for about half of the country's total fleet of aircraft of over 100 seats.

In 2012, the subsidiary of the EADS aerospace corporation plans to deliver a total of 120 new aircraft to China.

Company gains ground on rival Boeing in race to dominate market

When Peter Tiarks made his first trip to China nearly 30 years ago onboard the first ever Airbus aircraft demonstration tour to the country, Boeing aircraft dominated the Chinese skies.

Airbus SAS sold its first aircraft, an A310, to China two years later in 1985. Boeing Co had a 13-year head start.

But now Airbus is delivering two aircraft to China on average each week, and it controls 49 percent of the Chinese market for planes with more than 100 seats.

The question of how to serve the ever-increasing Airbus fleet in China - now with around 850 jets - tops the agenda for Tiarks, Airbus China vice-president for customer services.

Tiarks' answer to that challenge is to go beyond ensuring the quality and efficiency of basic support, and offer value-added services to help airlines improve their operations.

As oil prices surge to record-high levels, the European aircraft manufacturer believes it can help airlines save costs not only by building more fuel-efficient planes, but also through customer services, which meet the airlines' need for cost-effective outsourcing options, and help save costs in areas such as logistics, flight operations and engineering processes.

""The idea is that we take certain parts of the airlines' responsibilities, such as maintenance or engineering. We call it `tailored support packages',"" Tiarks said.

""We are well on track with the deployment of such services in China due to the open and innovative attitude of the Chinese airlines. Our intent is to deploy more and more enhanced services in China,"" he said.

The strategy is an essential part of an objective set by the EADS Group, Airbus' parent company, to generate 25 percent of its business revenue through services by 2020.

The European aerospace and defense conglomerate plans to have about 80 billion euros ($103.40 billion) in revenue by 2020, with 25 percent of the revenue expected to come from the high-value services.

Currently, services represent about 10 percent of the company's total revenues, which stood at 49 billion euros in 2011.

""We are well on track and, in fact, it's even possible to achieve the target ahead of schedule in China,"" Tiarks said.

Tiarks' confidence mainly comes from the fast-growing Airbus fleet in China. More than 100 Airbus planes are now delivered to China every year, which means that about 20 percent of the company's global production goes to China.

And that is thought to be just the beginning. As the world's fastest-growing commercial aviation market, China will need 5,260 new commercial aircraft, valued at $670 billion, over the next 20 years, Boeing said in its annual market outlook in September.

China is the world's second-largest market for domestic air traffic and the seventh largest for international passenger air traffic, according to the International Air Transport Association.

Flight hour services and spare parts logistics services are two packages well accepted by Chinese airlines, Tiarks said.

Flight hour services range from the supply of material and repairs to full maintenance. China Southern Airlines Co Ltd signed a contract with Airbus for customized flight hour services for its fleet of five A380s in April 2011. Airbus later signed similar agreements with Sichuan Airlines Co Ltd for its A330 fleet, and with Yangtze River Express Airlines Co Ltd for its A330 freighter fleet.

Airbus also started a door-to-door customized spare parts logistics service in China in 2008.

Using DHL as a forwarder for shipments, Airbus provides spare-parts deliveries and takes full control of the supply chain for customers.

The service is designed to reduce logistical complexity and administration workload for customers, enabling them to concentrate on their core business.

Seven Chinese aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul, or MRO, companies signed up for the service.

The companies include Guangzhou Aircraft Maintenance Engineering Co Ltd, the MRO arm of China Southern Airlines, and Shanghai Technologies Aerospace Co Ltd, the maintenance provider for China Eastern Airlines.

Airbus' US archrival Boeing also offers value-added services to Chinese airlines.

For instance, Air China has signed a contract with Boeing for an aircraft health management service for a total of 117 Boeing 737 planes. The service allows Air China to gather and evaluate real-time in-flight flying-conditions data. The data allow the airline to better plan and perform repairs.

Pilot training

Airbus recently added a new A320 full-flight simulator to its training joint venture Hua-Ou Aviation Training Center in Beijing.

The 12,300-square-meter training center is now equipped with four full-flight simulators, three for the A320 family and one for the A330/A340 family.

Boeing's training center in Shanghai has three simulators.

The new simulator can also be upgraded to support flight training for the new A320neo plane.

ICBC Financial Leasing Co Ltd - the leasing arm of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd - has ordered 20 A320neo aircraft. The new plane, a revamped A320 with new engines, is scheduled to enter service in 2015.

Compared with China's huge demand for pilots, the training capacity at the Hua-Ou center is still limited.

Boeing forecast that China will need about 72,700 pilots to operate the 5,000 new planes entering service in the next two decades.

The country now has more than 20,000 pilots, operating a fleet of about 1,800 aircraft.

China's pilot training capacity can hardly catch up with the fast-growing aviation market, said Zhu Qingyu, director of the marketing department of the China Air Transport Association.

""Our mission in China is to secure the entering-into-service of new operators and to teach the Airbus way to Chinese customers,"" said Thierry Marty, senior director at Hua-Ou.

Like the Airbus' training centers in other countries, the Hua-Ou center is receiving more and more young and inexperienced pilots, Marty said.

""They lack experience and just graduated from schools like the Civil Aviation Flight University of China. We have to adapt to that,"" Marty said.

Hua-Ou is now offering more entry-level training services.

""We have to get them ready at the right moment with the right skills,"" Marty said.

Boeing is ending 2012 on a high note.

For the first time in a decade, the Seattle-based company is ending the year as the world's No. 1 airplane manufacturer, outselling and delivering more jets than its closest competitor, the French company Airbus, the Seattle Times reports.

Boeing's tally for commercial jet deliveries this year is 585. It's the highest total ever, excluding 1999, when the last-of-the-line McDonnell Douglas jets bumped up deliveries.

According to the Times' end-of-year analysis of Boeing, the order total for airplanes reached 1,121 in mid-December. That's second only to the all-time sales record of 2007.

Boeing marketing executive Randy Tinseth told the Times that he expects future jet programs to do well in 2013, including the 737 MAX and the 787-9 and the still-to-be-launched 787-10 and 777X derivatives of its twin-aisle jets.

He said he expects the 747 market to improve and that there's no plan to cut production for now, even though orders for the new 747-8 have slowed down.

ARCHIVES: Boeing updates 737 for a new era

Boeing executives have also dismissed concerns over a potential strike by engineers and technical workers after tomorrow.

Labor woes aside, Boeing has become an essential employer in Washington state.

The company added almost 5,000 new jobs in Washington state in 2012. The year before, 8,300 new workers were hired, the Times reported.

Boeing's in-state workforce has reached almost 87,000, the highest since 1999.

Executives told the paper that hiring will pick up again after the holiday lull, with an orientation class for 190 new mechanics beginning Jan. 4.

Much of Boeing's success this year can be attributed to strong sales of a new more fuel-efficient version of its narrowbody jet, the 737 MAX, which will debut in 2017, the paper reports.

As of mid-December, Boeing had sold 969 MAXs.

The company is trying to speed up construction of the planes. This spring, Boeing will bump up the monthly rate of construction of its 737s at its Renton, WA, plant from 35 planes to 38, the Times reports.

But Airbus still poses a significant threat with its rival A320neo, which preceded the MAX by eight months and has so far outsold it by more than 680 firm orders.

Airbus scored a major victory earlier this month when Pegasus Airlines of Turkey ordered 75 neos, ""becoming the first all-Boeing 737 customer to make a complete defection,"" the paper notes.

Can Boeing catch up? Tinseth says there will be plenty of MAX orders in 2013.

And when it comes to widebody jets, Boeing still has the edge with its 787 Dreamliner.

As of mid-December, there have been 844 cumulative orders of the Dreamliner, the Times reports.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999232292175293}",positive,0.9999232292175293,1

AirAsia becomes first operator of Airbus” Sharklet equipped A320 – Image from Airbus (click for larger) - Airline Reporter,"Fri, 21 Dec 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vYTMyMC1zaGFya2xldC1haXJhc2lhXzAyXy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"FROM PRESS RELEASE: Airbus has delivered the first A320 equipped with Sharklets today to AirAsia, which becomes the first operator of the new fuel-saving large wing tip devices. Sharklets are an option on new-build A320 Family aircraft, and are standard on all members of the A320neo Family.

Sharklets are made from light-weight composites and are 2.4 metres tall. These newly designed wing-tip devices reduce fuel burn and emissions by improving the aerodynamics of the aircraft significantly. Cutting airlines’ fuel bills by around four percent, Sharklets will offer the flexibility to A320 Family operators of either adding around 100 nautical miles more range or allowing increased payload capability of up to 450 kilogrammes.

’œWe are extremely proud to be the first airline in the world to take delivery of an A320 fitted with Airbus’ new, fuel saving Sharklets,’ said Tan Sri Tony Fernandes, Group Chief Executive Officer of AirAsia . ’œAirAsia has a long-standing, special relationship with Airbus and as we grow our network with our all A320 fleet, these new wing tip devices will contribute to fulfilling our goal of being the most efficient, innovative low cost airline in the world.’

’œAs our biggest A320 Family airline customer, it’s very fitting that AirAsia is the first carrier to benefit from the four percent fuel saving our new Sharklets deliver,’ said John Leahy, Airbus Chief Operating Officer, Customers. ’œAirAsia’s vision is to make is possible for everyone to fly and now with their Sharklet-equipped A320s they can assure their passengers that they are also travelling on board the world’s most environmentally friendly single-aisle aircraft.’

Due to the very strong customer demand for Sharklets, all Airbus’ single-aisle final assembly lines (FALs) will be engaged in building A320 Family aircraft with Sharklets. These FALs are located in Toulouse (France), Hamburg (Germany) and Tianjin (China) and will soon be followed by an additional A320 FAL in Mobile (Alabama, USA).

AirAsia, the largest low cost airline in Asia is also Airbus’ largest A320 Family airline customer. The carrier recently placed a new order with Airbus on the 13th December 2012 for 100 more A320 Family aircraft including 36 A320ceo aircraft with Sharklets. Altogether, AirAsia has ordered 475 single aisle aircraft from Airbus, comprising 264 A320neo and 211 A320ceo. Over 100 aircraft have already been delivered to the airline and are flying out of its bases in Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Manila and Tokyo.

The A320 Family is the world’s best-selling and most modern single aisle aircraft Family. To date, close to 8,900 aircraft have been ordered and over 5,300 delivered to more than 380 customers and operators worldwide.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9981256127357483}",positive,0.9981256127357483,1

Hua Ou Aviation Training Center in Beijing, a joint venture of Airbus SAS and China Aviation Supplies Holding Co, on Dec 3 commissioned its first A320 full flight simulator that is upgradeable to support flight training for the A320neo.

The new simulator, which will use the flight training of current A320 aircraft, can be easily upgraded to support the Airbus A320neo, said Raymond Lim, Hua Ou Aviation general manager.

The A320neo will enter service in 2015, and ICBC Financial Leasing Co Ltd signed an agreement with Airbus for 20 A320neos in August. ICBC Financial Leasing is also A320neo’s first customer in China.

The simulator is also the fourth full flight simulator for Airbus aircraft in the training center, including three for A320 family and one for A330 and A340 family aircraft. Over 24,000 professionals — including pilots, flight attendants, maintenance technicians, performance personnel and structure technicians — have been trained in the center.

Most of the trainees in the center are from Chinese airlines, although the center has trained crews from more than 30 airlines worldwide.

“Chinese customers are still primarily centered in Beijing,” said Peter Tiarks, Airbus China’s customer service vice-president.

By the end of October, Airbus delivered over 720 A320 family aircraft to Chinese customers.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999946355819702}",neutral,0.9999946355819702,0

CNN —

It was conceived in secret in the 1980s but it’s difficult to miss the Airbus A380 these days.

The giant aircraft is a true leviathan of the sky and has just marked its fifth year of commercial service.

In October 2007 Singapore Airlines became the first airline to fly the A380, the world’s longest commercial airliner at the time. That title is now claimed by the Boeing 747-8 Intercontinental, but the A380 is still wider and carries more passengers.

Since first taking to the skies to great fanfare, 89 A380s have come into service around the world, with Thai Airways recently becoming the ninth airline to operate the “Superjumbo.”

In total, 257 orders for new A380s are booked in, with Airbus aiming to ramp up production to as many as three aircraft per month in the coming years.

Cultivating this demand is essential if the plane is to be profitable. The A380 initially arrived three years overdue and billions of dollars over budget. Other setbacks during its first five years of service – including cracks in the wing components discovered in January this year – have also slowed production as checks and repairs were made on the worldwide fleet.

Despite these challenges, Airbus says it expects to break even on the A380 by 2015. Key to this expansion is securing large orders in emerging markets such as Brazil, China and Mexico, the company says.

Stiff challenges will undoubtedly come from Boeing’s 747-8i, but with a few years’ head start, Airbus hopes the A380 will see off the competition.

China Southern inks Airbus A330 purchase - Chinadaily.com.cn - China Daily,"Thu, 06 Dec 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmFsLmNoaW5hZGFpbHkuY29tLmNuL2NuZHkvMjAxMi0xMi8wNi9jb250ZW50XzE1OTkwNTU1Lmh0bdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A China Southern Airlines Co Ltd Airbus A330 lands in Wuhan, Hubei province. According to Airbus, the catalogue price of one Airbus A330-300 aircraft is $188 million. Jin Siliu / For China Daily

China Southern Airlines Co Ltd, the largest carrier in Asia by fleet, said on Wednesday that it had signed an acquisition agreement with Airbus SAS to buy 10 A330-300 aircraft.

The acquisition of the wide-body aircraft for medium and long-haul routes, which will be delivered from 2014 to 2016, will ""facilitate the internationalization of the company"", the carrier said.

According to Airbus, the catalogue price of one Airbus A330-300 aircraft is $188 million.

China Southern said the amount it will pay, partly through financing arrangements with banking institutions and partly in cash, is lower than the catalogue price.

The airline said the new aircraft will help it to optimize its fleet structures and maximize operational efficiency.

The aircraft also will increase the carrier's available ton kilometers by 5.7 percent compared with the figure on Dec 31, 2011, the airline said.

Its acquisition of wide-body aircraft is in accordance with a call made earlier by Li Jun, deputy director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, for carriers to buy more wide-body aircraft to relieve the pressure from growing demand and limited airspace.

Enhancing international networks is a main strategy of Chinese carriers, and wide-body aircraft are required for them to operate more international routes, business insiders said.

China Southern has been using Airbus A380s on its Guangzhou-Los Angeles route since Oct 12.

The super jumbo has performed very well on the route and its load factor remained above 60 percent in October, according to China Southern.

According to Airbus' global outlook for 2012 to 2031, 6,500 wide-body aircraft will be delivered globally and 46 percent of them will work in Asia.

Boeing Co forecast in September that China will need 1,190 wide-body aircraft over the next 20 years.

China Southern is not the first Chinese carrier to sign an acquisition agreement with Airbus after the European Union announced a one-year freeze on Nov 12 of its emission rules applying to overseas airlines.

China Eastern Airlines Corp Ltd announced on Nov 23 it would buy 60 A320 aircraft, which have a catalogue price of $5.39 billion.

The aircraft will be delivered from 2014 to 2017, China Eastern said.

Airbus reported in March that orders worth $12 billion from China had been suspended due to the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme.

ICBC Financial Leasing Co Ltd, Airbus' first Chinese customer after the ETS issue arose, signed an agreement in August with Airbus for a total of 50 A320s, including 30 A320neo aircraft.

Prince Alwaleed's Tricked Out A380 Jet - Business Insider,"Fri, 21 Dec 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vcHJpbmNlLWFsd2FsZWVkcy10cmlja2VkLW91dC1hMzgwLWpldC0yMDEyLTEy0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9wcmluY2UtYWx3YWxlZWRzLXRyaWNrZWQtb3V0LWEzODAtamV0LTIwMTItMTI_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Prince Alwaleed is worth an estimated $18 billion

Earlier this year, Dealbook revealed that billionaire Saudi prince Alwaleed bin Talal al-Saud (of dwarf-tossing fame) was spending some $500 million on a fully customized A380 from Airbus, the most expensive private jet ever.

Now The Daily Mail has found out some jaw-dropping details about the plane, which the prince ordered more than three years ago.

Remember — the A380 is normally used as a commercial airliner, and can hold 800 passengers. But here's what Prince Alwaleed has reportedly tricked out the triple-decker jet with instead:

A parking spot for his Rolls-Royce

Five suites with king-sized beds and ensuite bathrooms with showers

First-class ""sleepers"" for an additional 20 guests

A steam room for spa treatments and a marble-finished Turkish bath

A boardroom with holographic displays

A prayer area ""in which computer-generated mats move to point towards Mecca""

A ""concert hall"" with a baby grand piano and seating for 10

A spiral staircase connecting all three floors

The average price for an A380 is $389 million, according to Airbus. But the prince's plane, with its lavish customizations, is expected to cost upwards of $500 million.

New Airbus arrives at Abraq airport - Libya Herald,"Thu, 20 Dec 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vbGlieWFoZXJhbGQuY29tLzIwMTIvMTIvbmV3LWFpcmJ1cy1hcnJpdmVzLWF0LWFicmFxLWFpcG9ydC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Ashraf Abdul Wahab.

Tripoli, 20 December:

A new A320 Airbus was handed over to Libyan Airlines today, Thursday. It was flown from . . .[restrict]Toulouse to Abraq airport. It is the second A320 to be delivered to the airline this month. The first, and the first to be delivered since the revolution, was flown to Misrata on 1 December.

A third A320 Airbus is to be delivered to Afrqiyah Airways on Monday 24 December —Libyan Independence Day. It will also be flown to Abraq. It will be the first without the carrier’s tail-plane 9999 logo which is being dropped.

The logo refers to the birth of the African Union in Sirte on 9 September 1999 (9/9/99). Qaddafi saw it as his creation. A new simpler logo was unveiled yesterday, Wednesday.

The newly delivered aircraft join both carriers’ expanding fleets.

Last month, it was announced in Tripoli by visiting French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius that Afriqiyah Airways had ordered four new A350-900 Airbus long-haul aircraft in addition to the six already ordered, making the whole deal worth $2.8 billion. Delivery will start in 2017.

Both Afriqyah and Libyan Airlines have other Airbus aircraft on order.

The newly delivered aircraft are expected to help ensure the lifting of the ban on Libyan aircraft from flying to Europe.

In April, both Afriqiyah and Libyan Airlines were banned from flying to EU destinations, because of serious concerns about “safety oversight”. The ban, which was imposed with the agreement with the then interim Libyan government, was due to last until November, but has not yet been lifted and to service some of their EU destinations, both carriers have been “wet-leasing” aircraft — hiring them complete with crews.

There have been reports in the past couple of days that Libyan Airlines would start flying again to destinations in the EU from 15 January.

“We will use the airbus 320s that have just been delivered,” the head of the Libyan Pilots’ Union, Captain Hussein Al-Futuri, told the Libya Herald today.

Although other airline sources in Tripoli cast doubt on the reports he said that “we’ve had promises from Brussels. We have negotiated with them that they will give us approval to fly. They promised they would give us approval ten days before 15 January. We need ten days to arrange schedules.”

Meanwhile, it has been announced that Benghazi-based private carrier Air Libya is to purchase an Avro RJ1000 for its international flights instead of leasing a Turkish aircraft.

"BA reveals Airbus A380, Boeing 787 Dreamliner seatmaps - Executive Traveller","Wed, 12 Dec 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vYmEtYnJpdGlzaC1haXJ3YXlzLXJldmVhbHMtYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtYm9laW5nLTc4Ny1kcmVhbWxpbmVyLXNlYXRtYXBz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"British Airways has unveilled the seating plan for its new Airbus A380 and Boeing 787 Dreamliners, both of which will take to the skies next year.

As previously reported, the British flag-carrier's A380 superjumbo will sport all four classes – from BA's lush First cabin to World Traveller economy and World Traveller Plus premium economy – while on the 787, BA continues the trend reported by Boeing of dropping first class for business, premium economy and economy.

BA Airbus A380 seatmap

The seating chart for British Airways' A380 shows each of the 12 superjumbos will carry 469 passengers across four classes.

As Australian Business Traveller revealed in September, British Airways won't be fitting an all-new Club World business class seat to the A380, opting instead for what a spokesperson described as ""an evolution of the current seat"".

The lower deck is the domain of 14 lush first class mini-suites, which BA promises will have ""extra personal and stowage space"" due to the A380's wider main deck compared to the current fleet of Boeing 747s and Boeing 777s.

Back behind the curtain will sit 44 Club World business class seats in a 2-4-2 configuration, followed by 199 World Traveller economy seats arranged 3-4-3.

Upstairs are a further 56 Club World business class seats in a 2-3-2 layout over two four-row cabins. Yes, we know the BA seatmap itself says 53 seats, but with eight rows of seven seats, you do the maths!

There's also a compact World Traveller Plus premium economy cabin of 55 seats in a 2-3-2 configuration, plus 104 more World Traveller economy seats arranged 2-4-2. (Our tip: those upstairs seats will be the ones to pick if you're in World Traveller.)

BA's split-level Club World business class

With Club World split over both decks of the A380 there's some promise for passengers critical of BA's business class seat not offering direct aisle access.

Over the three cabins – one downstairs, two upstairs – six window seats and five centre seats boast direct aisle access, while a pleasing twelve aisle seats have nobody picking their way over you.

BA, Qantas and other oneworld frequent flyers can usually snag these seats before others get their hands on them.

Interestingly, close scrutiny of the seatmap shows an extra side section in each the rear-facing middle seat. If this is a handy work area or additional inflight storage, these could be a top choice for business travellers.

British Airways has a dozen superjumbos on order, with the first due to arrive in July 2013 followed by three more before the year is out.

While BA as yet to announce routes for the A380, the airline has hinted that Hong Kong will be the superjumbo's debut route, while Hong Kong, Singapore, New York and Beijing are shortlisted for the A380s first commercial destinations.

British Airways is hinting that Hong Kong will be the debut route for its Airbus A380, with first flights around the middle of next year.

BA Boeing 787 seatmap

British Airways' Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner will carry 214 passengers divided into the predictable mix of business, premium economy and economy.

35 Club World business class seats sit at the pointy end in a new 'triple' configuration of 2-3-2, the same as upstairs on the A380. The extra space to the side of centre seats also appears on the A380 upstairs.

That's followed by 25 World Traveller Plus premium economy seats laid out 2-3-2, and 154 World Traveller economy seats split 3-3-3. (More on that economy layout below.)

Read: Boeing 787 customers drop first class

BA has 24 of the 787-8 Dreamliners on order, with the first due in May 2013 and three more by year's end.

A further 16 of the stretched Boeing 787-9s will follow from 2015, although the seating plan for those longer models has yet to be finalised.

BA's Dreamliner dilemna: good for business, bad for economy

Overall, the twin cabin Club World layout on the 787 is great news for business class passengers who appreciate the benefits of direct aisle access.

A full four window seats and two centre seats don't require you to vault like a gazelle (or hippo) over the person in the aisle. Similarly, a pleasing eight aisle seats don't have a window or centre passenger neeing to clamber their way out.

Bad news for Economy in the final analysis, though: British Airways has plumped for the ultra-dense 3-3-3 layout, where seats are as narrow as you'd find on a Boeing 737 short-range plane hopping between Melbourne and Sydney.

That's fine for a brief flight, but BA previously removed these extra-narrow seats from its Boeing 777 fleet when customers complained. Super-tight seating makes the BA 787 one to avoid in economy on the long haul.

We'll be keeping a keen eye on developments and will bring them to you as soon as we have news. Until then, keep an eye on our Twitter account: we're @AusBT.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999945163726807}",neutral,0.9999945163726807,0
