Airbus under investigation for involuntary manslaughter in 2009 crash - CNN,"Thu, 17 Mar 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHA6Ly93d3cuY25uLmNvbS8yMDExL1dPUkxEL2V1cm9wZS8wMy8xNy9mcmFuY2UuYWlyYnVzLmlucXVpcnkvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris (CNN) -- A French magistrate is investigating Airbus for involuntary manslaughter in connection with the mysterious 2009 crash of Air France Flight 447 into the southern Atlantic Ocean, according to the airline manufacturer and a court spokeswoman.

Judge Sylvie Zimmerman is presiding over the inquiry into the Airbus-made plane, court spokeswoman Sylvie Polack told CNN on Thursday. The plane fell into the sea while traveling from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, killing all 228 people aboard.

Thomas Enders, CEO of Airbus, disagreed with the decision to commence the investigation, he said in a statement.

""On behalf of Airbus, I have noted the absence of facts supporting this step and stated our strong disagreement,"" Enders said.

""Airbus maintains that the focus should be on finding the cause of this accident and making sure it can never happen again. Airbus will continue to support the investigation, including the continued search for the flight recorders, which is the only sure way to know the truth,"" Enders said.

Investigators have not yet established what caused the crash, and large parts of the plane -- including both flight recorders -- have never been found, despite an extensive search operation that included a French navy submarine.

The plane went down in stormy weather, and most of the bodies were never recovered.

Studies of the debris and bodies that were found led France's air accident investigation agency, the BEA, to conclude the plane hit the water belly first, essentially intact.

Oxygen masks were not deployed, indicating that the cabin did not depressurize, the BEA revealed in a 2009 report.

Automated messages sent from the plane in the minutes before the crash showed there were problems measuring air speed, the investigators said, though they said that alone was not enough to cause the disaster.

The area where the plane went down is far out in the Atlantic -- two to four days by ship from the nearest ports in Brazil or Senegal in West Africa. The rough underwater terrain includes mountains and valleys, the BEA said.

Pratt & Whitney wins contract to supply engines for Airbus A320neo aircraft - MassLive.com,"Mon, 14 Mar 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc3NsaXZlLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1uZXdzLzIwMTEvMDMvcHJhdHRfd2hpdG5leV93aW5zX2NvbnRyYWN0X3RvX3N1cHBseV9lbi5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"

By HOWARD FRENCH

Special to The Republican



Pratt & Whitney has been tapped to provide as many as 200 of its new geared turbofan engines to power up to 100 Airbus A320neo aircraft ordered by International Lease Finance Corp., company officials said last week.

The initial agreement includes an order for 120 PW1100G engines for 60 aircraft. ILFC, a California-based aircraft leasing company, also has options for up to 80 additional engines for 40 additional aircraft.

Deliveries are scheduled to begin in 2016.

No financial details were disclosed, but based on previous orders the deal should be worth well over $1 billion to Pratt if all options are exercised.

Each plane will be powered by two PW1100G engines, which Pratt touts as offering double-digit reductions in fuel consumption, lower environmental emissions, less engine noise, and lower operating costs when compared with conventional engines.

Todd Kallman, president of Pratt & Whitney Commercial Engines & Global Services, called the major contract a “strong endorsement of the PurePower PW1100G engine.” The ILFC order is the first engine contract for the Pratt engine on the Airbus A320neo aircraft, Kallman said.

Overall, Pratt has more than 800 of the PW1000G engines on order, including options, he said.

ILFC bills itself as the “international market leader in the leasing and re-marketing of commercial jet aircraft to airlines around the world.” The company claims a portfolio of about 950 jet aircraft.

It was the second major order for Pratt in as many days.

On Monday, Etihad Airways finalized a major order from the Pratt-General Electric Engine Alliance for jet engines and related services worth $1.5 billion.

The agreement had been under negotiations since June 2009.

Etihad, based in the United Arab Emirates, signed agreements to buy more than 40 of the partnership’s GP7200 engines to power 10 Airbus A380 aircraft, according to Engine Alliance President Mary Ellen Jones.

The agreement also includes a long-term fleet management agreement for the maintenance, repair, and overhaul of the engines.

Pratt is a subsidiary of Hartford-based United Technologies Corp.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999133348464966}",neutral,0.9999133348464966,0
Air France and Airbus face charges over Atlantic crash that killed 228 - The Guardian,"Fri, 18 Mar 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDExL21hci8xOC9haXItZnJhbmNlLWF0bGFudGljLWNyYXNoLWNoYXJnZXPSAU9odHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vd29ybGQvMjAxMS9tYXIvMTgvYWlyLWZyYW5jZS1hdGxhbnRpYy1jcmFzaC1jaGFyZ2Vz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A French judge has filed preliminary charges against Air France over a 2009 crash that killed all 228 people aboard when a jet plunged into the Atlantic ocean.

The airline's chief executive officer, Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, said at the courthouse in Paris: ""We are protesting about this. It seems to us that it is unfounded.""

Judge Sylvie Zimmerman filed the preliminary charges a day after doing the same against Airbus, the maker of the doomed jet. Preliminary charges allow judges to continue their investigations before deciding whether to send a case to trial.

Air France flight 447 dived into the Atlantic on 1 June 2009, amid an intense high-altitude thunderstorm while flying from Rio de Janeiro to Paris.

The cause of the crash remains unclear and may never be determined unless the black box flight recorders are found in the ocean depths. A fourth search operation for them starts next week.

Automatic messages sent by the Airbus 330's computers show it was receiving false air speed readings from sensors known as pitot tubes. Investigators have said the crash was probably caused by a series of problems, not just sensor error.

Air France and Airbus will finance the estimated $12.5m (£7.8m) cost of the search, in which three advanced underwater robots will scour the mountainous ocean floor between Brazil and western Africa, at depths of up to 4,000 metres (13,000ft).","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9149388670921326}",neutral,0.9149388670921326,0
AA11: Airbus predicts strong demand from Asia | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Mon, 07 Mar 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWExMS1haXJidXMtcHJlZGljdHMtc3Ryb25nLWRlbWFuZC1mcm9tLWFzaWEvOTg3MDAuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus forecasts that the Asia Pacific will become the world's biggest market for airliners in the next 20 years, with carriers in the region taking delivery of 8,560 new aircraft worth $1.2 trillion.

This will represent 33% of new aircraft deliveries worldwide, says Chris Emerson, Airbus's senior vice president product strategy and market forecast. Strong economic growth, libereralisation and greater wealth will ""enable more people who have never flown to take to the skies.""

Of the 8,560 new aircraft, 5,200 will be single aisle aircraft, 2,580 twin aisle aircraft, and 780 ""very large aircraft"" such as the A380.

""Within the next 20 years Asia Pacific airlines will be carrying a third of all passenger traffic worldwide and two thirds of all freight passing through the region,"" says Emerson. ""In order to meet the expected demand efficiently, larger aircraft will be need to ease congestion and do more with less.""

The European airframer predicts that passenger traffic for Asia Pacific will grow by 5.8% annually, compared with 4.8% globally. Freight traffic in the region will grow 7% annually, compared with 5.9% globally.

Revenue passenger kilometres (RPK) in Asia will also grow to 33% of the world's total in 2009, from just 27% now. This will come at the expense of North America and Europe. Airbus foresees North America's share of global RPKs falling to 20% by 2029, compared with 28% now, and Europe's share falling to 25%, compared with 28% now.

Airbus also notes that its duopoly with US rival Boeing will ultimately fray in the face of newcomers such as China's Comac, which is developing the C919 to compete with the A320 and 737 families, the Bombardier Cseries, and the Russian MS-21. In a presentation slide discussing the new entrants, Airbus placed a question mark next to the name of Brazilian airframer Embraer, which has yet to announce an aircraft in the A320/737 category.

It projects that such new entrants will reduce it and Boeing's overall share of new gross orders.

Airbus also sees large potential in Asia's still nascent low cost carrier market. It notes that low cost carrier growth in Asia is rising 38% annually, with LCC market share at 14% in 2009, compared with 2-3% in 2001. Globally, Airbus says LCCS comprise 20% of world seats, providing significant room for upside.

Aerospace giant EADS in talks to buy Vector - The Globe and Mail,"Thu, 24 Mar 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdsb2JlYW5kbWFpbC5jb20vZ2xvYmUtaW52ZXN0b3IvYWVyb3NwYWNlLWdpYW50LWVhZHMtaW4tdGFsa3MtdG8tYnV5LXZlY3Rvci9hcnRpY2xlNTc0MjE2L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A picture of the EADS' logo. Share

Airbus-maker EADS is in exclusive talks to take over Vector Aerospace Corp. , a Canadian success story in global aircraft maintenance and repair.

The European giant has Vector in its sights as part of its plan to diversify its business and expand its operations in North America and elsewhere.

Toronto-based Vector has grown over the past decade into a respected independent provider of MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) services for both commercial and military customers.

Late last year, Vector said it had received ""preliminary expressions of interest"" from several would-be buyers and was beginning a strategic review process that could lead to a sale.

On Thursday, EADS NV (European Aeronautic Defence and Space Co.) and Vector said in separate news releases that they have entered into an exclusive agreement for talks, with a view to a potential acquisition.

Neither company has provided details and both warned there is no guarantee the talks will lead to a binding offer.

But the talks indicate how eager EADS - Europe's biggest aerospace company - is to follow through on its intention to smooth the cyclical nature of its key commercial aircraft business by expanding into more stable businesses, including MRO, a sector in which it already does some work.

Vector would fit the bill nicely.

It has operations in Canada, the United States, Britain and Africa and its blue-chip customers include Bell Helicopters, Pratt & Whitney Canada, General Electric Co., Boeing Co. and EADS subsidiaries.

""Keep in mind that Vector has very large United Kingdom operations, after taking over the British government's aerospace defence repair agency,"" said PI Financial analyst Chris Murray.

""If a transaction takes place, EADS could expand quite a bit its British military work.""

Vector also has helicopter engine and airframe repair works as well as fixed-wing engine overhaul operations in Canada, with smaller repair and overhaul stations in the U.S., he said.

EADS' long-term strategic plan calls for it to increase revenues from services to 25 per cent of total revenues by 2020, up from 12 per cent in 2009, Mr. Murray said in a research update.

The company has also stated it wants to drum up more business outside its European home base and reduce its reliance on Airbus-related revenues.

Besides its Airbus subsidiary, EADS also owns Eurocopter, one of the largest helicopter manufacturers in the world.

It's not clear who else might also be interested in acquiring the shares of Vector.

After Vector said last year it was entertaining offers, reports emerged that interested companies included U.S. rivals Triumph Group and L-3 Communications Holdings, as well as several private-equity groups.

Other potentially interested parties could include privately held IMP Group International Inc. of Halifax, a significant Vector shareholder that tried unsuccessfully in 2009 to boost its stake to 53 per cent from 37.3 per cent.

Officials at IMP did not return calls Thursday.

Another contender could be West Face Capital, another major shareholder. Officials at Toronto-based West Face also did not return calls Thursday.

Vector posted profit of $33-million on revenue of $545-million last year. It has about 2,500 employees.

It provides services for a range of gas turbine engines, components and helicopter airframes.

Private jet makers eye China's billionaires - Yahoo Singapore News,"Fri, 11 Mar 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vc2cubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vcHJpdmF0ZS1qZXQtbWFrZXJzLWV5ZS1jaGluYXMtYmlsbGlvbmFpcmVzLTIwMTEwMzExLTA5MTIxMy0yNjMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The ""Phoenix Cabin"" has all the usual amenities that a billionaire might want in a private jet: plush leather chairs, soft carpet, and a flat-screen TV to watch while criss-crossing the globe. But with its red hues -- traditionally a lucky colour in China -- and centrepiece round table that doubles for playing mahjong, Airbus is setting its sights on the growing number of ultra-rich Chinese who can afford to shell out upwards of $65 million for their very own home and office in the sky. ""The round table with a Lazy Susan is the Chinese way of sharing and spending time together,"" Francois Chazelle, vice president of worldwide sales at Airbus Corporate Jets, told AFP at an air show that wrapped up in Hong Kong on Thursday. ""The first aircraft we sold into China had one and the customer immediately took to it."" Europe's Airbus says its private jet operation set a company record last year, delivering 15 planes worth $1.5 billion, with China standing out as the firm's fastest-growing market. Driving that surge is China's red-hot economy which has produced about 875,000 millionaires and almost 200 billionaires, according to the Hurun Rich List, the Chinese equivalent of the Forbes or Sunday Times rich lists. Chinese customers accounted for about 25 percent of business jet sales at Airbus in 2010, with sales expected to close in on the dominant oil-rich Middle East market in ""a couple of years,"" Chazelle said. Rival Bombardier is forecasting the industry will make 600 business jet deliveries in China between 2010 and 2019, while US-based Gulfstream is also boosting its presence in mainland China and Hong Kong, a financial hub synonymous with ultra-rich tycoons and grandiose displays of wealth. ""The race is on -- there is a lot of activity right now in China,"" Chazelle said. Boeing, a major player in the US market which was pounded during the global financial crisis, made all of its private jet sales last year to Asian clients, locking up deals in Singapore, Indonesia, and Thailand, said Jeff Dunn, the firm's Asia-Pacific sales director for business jets. ""But China is a great market for us too,"" he added. ""We see very steady growth in this region -- everybody is here. And I think it will stay that way. The numbers will continue to grow in Asia."" Smaller planes are popular in the US market, while bigger, long-range jets that can carry more passengers are a hit among Asia's elite, who tend to make ""quick decisions and want quick delivery,"" Dunn said. ""Big, big and bigger is showing dominance and the interiors are very extravagant -- it's a cultural preference,"" he added. ""Because of long-range travel requirements from Asian customers, the cabin is very important, and so is connectivity,"" added David Dixon, Bombardier's regional vice president for business aircraft sales. But almost all clients want a plane so they can do business in private, sleep in a full-size bed, or catch a shower as they race around the globe. ""It gives you a flying office,"" said Chazelle, who saw one customer log a remarkable 1,200 flying hours in a year, or about three hours daily. ""It was kind of a record. (Customers) want to be more efficient travelling the world,"" he added. A dining area for 10 guests, ""endless"" hot water for bathing, casino tables, slot machines, a gym for sky-high workouts or karaoke machines to belt out your favourite tunes are all possible options for those with cash to burn. ""We've seen just about everything put in an airplane,"" Dunn said. As Chinese companies spread out across the globe, private jet makers are also hoping to boost their all-important sales to corporations, along with governments that need a secure way to transport heads of state, observers said. Restrictions on private aviation in China have been a key hurdle to tapping the market further since they make last-minute changes to a flight plan -- common among jet owners -- almost impossible, Dunn said. But regulators appear set to loosen those restrictions, observers said. ""A lot of progress is already taking place,"" Chazelle said. ""Chinese regulators are being more and more welcoming to business aviation.""","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9814954400062561}",positive,0.9814954400062561,1

The airline started its first scheduled flight of the A380 to the United States. The flight from Frankfurt to New York’s JFK is the fourth Airbus A380 route for the airline, after Tokyo, Beijing and Johannesburg.

’œIn early 2007, Lufthansa and Airbus jointly landed the first Airbus A380 on U.S. soil, here in New York during a route-proving flight to North America. Now we are returning with scheduled A380 flight operation. New York is one of the most important markets for Lufthansa, so it was imperative for us to launch transatlantic flights on our flagship aircraft to this U.S. gateway,’ said Jens Bischof, Vice President The Americas for Lufthansa. ’œWe are proud to offer New Yorkers the option to experience this amazing aircraft, combined with Lufthansa’s award-winning service, thus taking the flying experience in all three classes to a whole new level,’ Bischof continued.

Although this is the first Lufthansa Airbus A380 flight to the US, this won’t be the last. The airline has already announced their plans to fly from Frankfurt to San Fransisco starting on May 10, 2011. According to ATI and Flight Global, the airline states the recent issues with the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines will not affect the delivery schedule of the A380. The airline plans to increase their A380 fleet to eight by mid-summer.

With increasing the number of A380’s and being the first customer of the Boeing 747-8 Intercontinental, Lufthansa is quickly working on having one of the best aircraft fleets in the world.

Currently there aren’t too many Airbus A380 flights to and from the US. Dan Jones with the site Route Watch, walked me through the current flights:

JFK in New York:

Emirates from Dubai (DXB) as UAE201 daily

Lufthansa from Frankfurt (FRA) as DLH400 not daily, only A380-800 on Mon and Fri after March 27

Air France from Paris (CDG) as AFR006 not daily, Tue and Wed are 777-300ER (77W)

Korean to be 3x weekly starting in August going to daily in September as KAL81



LAX in Los Angeles:

Qantas from Sydney (SYD) as QFA11 daily

Singapore starting March 27 will upgrade SIA11 SIN-NRT-LAX to the A380

Flight 447 crash probe also to include look at Air France-KLM - CNN,"Fri, 18 Mar 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHA6Ly93d3cuY25uLmNvbS8yMDExL1dPUkxEL2V1cm9wZS8wMy8xOC9mcmFuY2UuZmxpZ2h0LjQ0Ny5pbnF1aXJ5L2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris (CNN) -- An investigation into the mysterious 2009 crash of Air France Flight 447 into the southern Atlantic Ocean will also include a probe into Air France-KLM, the airline's attorney said Friday.

A French magistrate already is investigating Airbus for involuntary manslaughter in connection with the crash, according to the airline manufacturer and a court spokeswoman. However, Fernand Garnault, the attorney for Air France-KLM, said he doesn't know why the airline is part of the investigation.

He said the magistrate is looking into a problem involving pitot tubes, which measure a plane's air speed. Still, ""there is nothing new in this case and there is no proof that the pitot tubes caused the crash,"" Garnault told CNN.

Judge Sylvie Zimmerman is presiding over the inquiry into the Airbus-made plane, court spokeswoman Sylvie Polack told CNN on Thursday. The plane fell into the sea while traveling from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, killing all 228 people aboard.

“The aircraft’s nose was raised until a special ‘bumper’ fitted to the rear fuselage struck the ground at the maximum pitch-up angle of 13º,” Airbus Military says. The result exceeds its earlier assumption of a 12º limit which had been projected following previous tests conducted late last year.

Downpayments from airlines rushing to meet growth in emerging markets helped to swell EADS's coffers by more than €2 billion (Dh10.23 billion) and left it with a record net cash surplus of €11.9 billion, matched by an appetite for acquisitions.

""I think you will hear something on that in 2011,"" finance director Hans Peter Ring told journalists, adding that the company's previously stated target of €1-2 billion in acquisitions was ""not a magic figure"".

Ring told journalists contacts had been made ""across the Atlantic"" with a view to acquisitions but declined to elaborate.

EADS, Europe's top aerospace group, wants to expand its $1.2 billion (Dh4.4 billion) US revenue by about ten-fold to help reduce its reliance on commercial jets and is under increased pressure to deliver on its strategy after losing a competition to supply air tankers to the US Air Force.

But for now, the company's financial fortunes firmly remain at the whim of commercial airlines.

Yesterday's results were put in the shade by a $29 billion slew of plane orders in the previous 24 hours, about half of which will benefit Airbus, the EADS planemaking subsidiary, with the rest scooped up by arch-rival Boeing.

""The commercial market has seen an impressive rebound, especially in the growth-hungry emerging markets,"" Ring said.

EADS shares were up 3.6 per cent at €20.555 by 0946, the top gainers on the French benchmark CAC 40 index, after earlier rising as much as 4.2 per cent.

Oil price impact

As oil prices rise, airlines are for now placing orders to renew fleets with more fuel-efficient planes. But any further dramatic increase in oil could stifle demand, analysts say.

""Oil prices provide a short-term pressure for airlines, but in the long term they provide pressure to renew their fleets,"" EADS chief executive Louis Gallois said.

EADS posted higher than expected 2010 revenue of €45.8 billion, up 7 per cent, and operating profit of €1.231 billion. The Franco-German-led group restored a dividend of 22 euro cents after posting a net profit of €553 million.

Analysts were expecting EADS operating profit of €1.236 billion on revenue of €44.681 billion and net profit of €500 million, a Reuters poll found. In 2009, EADS sank to a net loss of €800 million after taking provisions on delays to the Airbus A400M military plane. After a severe downturn in 2009, commercial aviation is recovering faster than expected, driven by demand for transport to move people and goods as emerging markets expand.

But there have been warnings that turmoil in Libya and rising oil prices could pinch the recovery.

EADS said it would need to monitor developments in North Africa, oil prices and currencies. For 2011, EADS predicted unspecified growth in revenue and said operating profit before one-off items would be stable, compared with €1.3 billion in 2010, before rising significantly the following year. Increasing volume and prices at Airbus will be offset by higher research and development spending, poorer currency hedge rates and weakness in defence, it said.

A350 challenge

EADS reiterated it would deliver its first A350 in the second half of 2013 but said the time schedule remained ""challenging"". It reported progress in paring cost overruns on the A380 superjumbo and said gross margins were improving.

Europe's top aerospace group, however, faces potential embarrassment over its cash surplus as it wraps up a deal with European governments to rescue its A400M military plane with €3.5 billion of extra public money, some of which is repayable.

Investors are also concerned that the company's balance sheet is bloated with too much cash to be efficient. ""It seems like a large number to be sitting on,"" one analyst told the company's leaders.

EADS officials said one reason for the cash increase was a rebound in financial markets, which had removed the need for backstop customer financing for which Airbus had budgeted.

""I prefer to have questions on strong net cash than no net cash at all,"" CEO Louis Gallois told analysts.

""It gives us capacity and room for manoeuvre ... through organic growth and investment in new segments such as security and also through acquisitions, but I don't want to be under pressure and am not indicating any time schedule or volume targets,"" he said.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999794960021973}",positive,0.9999794960021973,1

West Country Cash: New from Airbus: A bike to transform Aerospace - BBC,"Mon, 07 Mar 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jby51ay9ibG9ncy9kYXZlaGFydmV5LzIwMTEvMDMvbmV3X2Zyb21fYWlyYnVzX2FfYmlrZV90b190cmFuLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Engineers are often not the world's best communicators. In my experience, many of them are happy to beaver away in their workshops, solving problems for the rest of us before we've even realised they were there.

Every day, at Filton's famous Aircraft Factory, engineers do astonishing things.

A few make headlines. The Box Kite, the Concord, the Brabazon, the A380 Superjumbo.

But I spend a lot of time looking at innovations that are, to the outside, baffling.

Which was why my ears pricked up when I heard about the Airbus Bike.

I've just finished making a documentary about it, but this morning they had it on BBC Breakfast News.

Two young engineers at the Innovation Works were so excited about a new machine they have, they decided to make a bike. Yes, two wheels, pedals, that kind of bike.

""You can show people satellite brackets, but they don't get it,"" explained one of them, Chris Turner. ""My mum asks me about work, and I can show her brackets and stuff, but a bike - now that she understands.""

It's a bit of a revelation this. Engineers who care that we understand.

Chris and his colleague Andy Hawkins have been working weekends on their pushbike. They want people to get as excited about ALM as they are, and they think the bike will do it.

ALM? Ah, the technology. Additive Layer Manufacturing.

It's basically quite simple. You take a 3D object, like a bike saddle, and slice it on computer into thousands of 2D layers. A pile of these layers will make a complete object. The clever bit is how they make their layers.

They start with this powder - nylon, in this case. Heated to 177 degrees C, it is about to melt. A laser traces the outline of the 2D shape, fusing the nylon solid.

Another layer, 0.1mm thick, and another laser.

Gradually, the object takes shape. Because it is encased in powder, you can create solid objects in space, in other words, moving parts. The bike would come out of the machine with ball-bearings already in place, a crank shaft that would turn, wheels that would spin, without any additional parts.

Sound simple? Well, I've been watching them for six weeks, and it was anything but.

The first attempt at creating the wheel hub went horribly wrong.

The measurements were out, by a few millimetres, and the bearings simply fell out.

But Chris and Andy understand communication so well, they knew they had to let us carry on filming. If things went wrong, their project would become a struggle we care about.

Typical engineers, they blustered about prototypes, and 'back to the drawing board', lessons learnt. Then, I asked Chris how it felt.

""It feels rubbish!"" he laughed. ""It feels like I really don't want that to happen again, I want to get back and make it work properly.""

See, now you care about this technology, and whether they'll manage to make the bike work. To find out, just watch the film we made. It's on Inside Out West, which you can find here.

Meanwhile, a few thoughts about what ALM could do.

The real breakthrough is that ALM smashes the barrier between designer and manufacturing shop floor. You no longer have to design parts around what you can actually make, using lathes, casting, machining etc. Instead, the designer just draws on a 3D computer programme, and the ALM machine effectively prints it out.

In aerospace this means they can make wing parts with hollow truss structures built in, saving weight and material. They can create complex labyrinths of pipes for F1 engines that would be impossible the old way. Most of all, it means the designer is king again. And that, more than anything, is good news for the UK.

Increasingly, UK manufacturing has been going hi-tech, high value. Anything that you can make in a box is usually shipped in from the Far East. Companies like Dysons now design here, and manufacture 'over there'. But if design and manufacturing move closer together, British firms can hang on to a reason to be here.

So the factory that gave us Concorde and the Box Kite may yet transform British manufacturing, with a little nylon bicycle.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999500513076782}",neutral,0.9999500513076782,0
ABC TV probes Qantas Airbus A380 engine explosion on QF32 - Executive Traveller,"Mon, 28 Mar 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vYWJjLXR2LXByb2Jlcy1xYW50YXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtZW5naW5lLWV4cGxvc2lvbi1vbi1xZjMy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"See our full story on last night's Four Corners report:

Rolls-Royce knew Qantas' A380 engines were faulty

Previous

The mid-air engine explosion on Qantas flight QF32 from Singapore – on no lesser aircraft than an Airbus A380, the pride of the Qantas fleet – created shockwaves felt throughout the aviation world.

It put not only Qantas' own safety record under scrutiny but also raised questions about the safety of the Airbus A380 and the Rolls-Royce engines which many airlines – including Qantas, Singapore Airlines and Lufthansa – had chosen to power the superjumbo.

Tonight's episode of the ABC TV investigate current affairs program Four Corners, screening 8.30pm EST, examines how a single engine part almost brought down the pride of the Qantas fleet.

From the ABC TV press release for tonight's show:

When 440 passengers boarded Qantas Flight 32 bound for Sydney last November, they had every reason to feel confident. They were flying an airline boasting a unique safety record, on the world's newest, most sophisticated civilian aircraft, powered by prestigious Rolls Royce engines, famous for their reliability.

But six minutes into the flight all that would change, when an explosion sent pieces of searing hot metal shooting out of the engine faster than the speed of sound.

Four Corners: QF32 tells the compelling story of the frightening hours that followed.

From the passengers who looked on in horror as a human-sized hole appeared in one wing...

""I'm thinking it's black debris that's coming out of the plane, if it hits the fuselage we're gone"" – Passenger Rosemary Hegarty

...to the cabin crew:

""The rear of the engine was all smashed and damaged, and the wing was damaged and we could see we were losing fuel and then when my colleague said look, the kangaroo has gone, I knew that was an ... engine failure."" – Customer Service Manager Michael von Reth

... and the pilots who drew on every ounce of their experience and training to bring the plane under control.

""Matt Hicks is a very competent operator with 15 or so years in Qantas, having flown a 767, 747, A330 and A380 ... I wouldn't have liked to have seen someone with very low hours trying to do that job on that day."" – Second Officer Mark Johnson

And the horrified Qantas staff who tried to verify reports of deaths on the ground as pieces of engine rained down on an Indonesian primary school. Miraculously no-one was hurt, but a piece of shrapnel tore through a classroom ceiling just centimetres away from a 5-year-old boy.

The landing itself was nerve-wracking and fraught with difficulty. As pilot Matt Hicks recalls: ""I actually had a swig of water cause I was getting a bit dry in the throat. (I) thought about my wife and kids for a while. Thought I better do a decent job here otherwise I'm not coming home .""

Changi air traffic controllers and firefighters recount how they watched in awe as the plane roared down the runway:

""...aircraft on final (approach) fuel streaming from the wing, I think I've not seen that in my last 26 years."" – Air Traffic controller Tony Tang

But the nightmare wasn't over. With fuel gushing from the aircraft the risk of fire was extreme and one engine refused to shut down. It was another very long hour before the passengers and crew were finally allowed off the plane.

As the passengers disembarked, the search for the cause of the explosion was already underway. Qantas went into damage control and immediately pointed the finger at the august British engine maker Rolls Royce. What everyone wanted to know was, what caused the explosion and was it safe to fly on the A380?

Four Corners reporter Sarah Ferguson takes us through the hunt for clues as the investigators cordoned off the plane as if it were a crime scene. They describe the 'golden bullet' moment when the source of the fire was discovered. The program also reveals the problems Rolls Royce experienced with the engine prior to the Qantas incident.

Four Corners: QF32 offers a gripping forensic account of a truly terrifying mid-air incident and screens tonight, Monday March 28, at 8.30pm on ABC 1. The program can also be watched online at the Four Corners website and ABC TV iView.

The edition of Four Corners online has extended interviews with Qantas CEO Alan Joyce, QF32 pilot Captain Richard De Crespigny and Qantas Head of Maintenance Operations Alan Milne.

Components for 6th Airbus A400 to depart for Spain next month - defenceWeb,"Thu, 10 Mar 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuY2V3ZWIuY28uemEvYWVyb3NwYWNlL2Flcm9zcGFjZS1hZXJvc3BhY2UvY29tcG9uZW50cy1mb3ItNnRoLWFpcmJ1cy1hNDAwLXRvLWRlcGFydC1mb3Itc3BhaW4tbmV4dC1tb250aC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"South African components for the sixth Airbus A400M will be shipped to Seville, Spain for final assembly onto the aircraft next month, Denel Saab Aerostructures (DSA) says. The South African company is contracted to provide wing-to-fuselage fairings (WFF) and so-called top shells to the 174 A400M still on order for delivery to eight countries from December next year at the earliest.

“The redesigned WFF for the MSN-006 aircraft has already commenced delivery of sub-sets to the full ship set, in November 2010 and will be fully delivered by mid April 2011, as scheduled by Airbus. This will enable the fully assembled aircraft to take to the skies in December 2011.”

DSA says full production of the A400M is expected to start no later than 2016. The company anticipates producing up to a maximum of 2.5 WFF units per month from early 2016. The WFF was designed from scratch at DSA and is locally produced using predominantly local technology and labour. DSA, Aerosud and Cobham-Omnipless are the only component manufacturer outside of Europe and Turkey involved in the project and the South African flag is prominently displayed on the cockpit of the massive transporter currently undergoing advanced flight testing in challenging conditions.

“Our participation in the Airbus production process is testimony to the ingenuity of our engineering team and the quality of our workmanship,” says DSA CE Ismail Dockrat. It has brought significant benefits to the local aviation industry and confirmed South Africa’s status as a reliable supplier and innovative design partner, he adds.

DSA A400M Project Manager Roland Diem says the WFF is an essential part of the aircraft that provides protection to the sensitive equipment under the centre wing portion against lightning strikes, hail damage and bird strikes. It is made up of 86 composite panels and doors and some 1100 metallic sub-structural parts and is designed for ease of systems installation and maintenance.

Diem adds that during the evaluation of the first prototype it became apparent that the aircraft was about 12 000kg over its target weight. “All suppliers and component manufacturers were required to reduce the total aircraft weight by some 7000kg. In the end a combined saving of only 700kg was achieved of which DSA was responsible for more than 130kg – without compromising safety or functionality.

Subsequent load loops resulted in significant changes being required to the design and build of the aircraft. DSA was tasked to make the relevant changes to the WFF for MSN-006 baseline to ensure structural integrity and safety was maintained. The initial indications were that the redesign could take up to three years to complete, without any additional resources, resulting in major delays in the final production schedule, Diem says. “Through the technical expertise and ingenuity of the DSA design team together with a massive integrated management team effort, this period was significantly shortened.”

The Airbus A400M was commissioned to meet the need for heavy airlift capacity that can transport modern military equipment and humanitarian relief supplies into inaccessible global hotspots. The aircraft has a payload capability of more than 30 000 kg, a range of 8710km and can land and take off in less than 1000 metres.

Although South Africa cancelled its own order of eight Airbus A400M aircraft the work packages remain with DSA. The company also manufactures the aircraft’s top shells which are positioned in front of, and behind the wings where it is joined to the fuselage. DSA is producing two top shells for each aircraft – one each in front and behind of the wing box, which joins the wing to the fuselage.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9964359998703003}",neutral,0.9964359998703003,0
