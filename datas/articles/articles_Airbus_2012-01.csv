Airbus Finds Fix For Cracks In Super Jumbo Wings - WIRED,"Thu, 26 Jan 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS8yMDEyLzAxL2FpcmJ1cy1maW5kcy1maXgtZm9yLWNyYWNrcy1pbi1zdXBlci1qdW1iby13aW5ncy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus says it has a fix ready for a problem discovered in several of the A380s currently in service. The issue is small cracks in components found within the wing of the world's largest airliner. The company says the cracks are not a safety issue and it has found the source of the problem.

The cracks were first seen during the inspection of a Qantas A380 that had suffered an in-flight engine failure in 2010 where pieces from the engine had pierced a section of wing. The uncontained engine failure was not related to the small cracks, but it was the first time they were noticed.

The small cracks are found L-shaped brackets that attach the thin aluminum skin of the wing to ribs that form the shape of the wing. There are about 2,000 of these brackets in each wing. If the cracks were to lead to a failure in a single bracket, it is unlikely there would be any safety issue. Airbus has said on several occasions that the A380 is safe to fly. But the European agency that oversees aviation safety has issued an order for inspections of about a third of the current A380 fleet.

The cracks have prompted the European Aviation Safety Agency to issue an airworthiness directive calling for the inspection of A380s that have been in service the longest. The agency says if left undetected and not fixed, the cracks ""could potentially affect the structural integrity of the aeroplane"" according to Aviation Week & Space Technology.

Airbus has acknowledged the issue and says the finding of cracks in more aircraft over the past week is inline with the expectations based on the cause of the problem. The airplane maker expects cracks will be seen in most A380s that are currently in service.

The company is changing the way the brackets are attached to the ribs reducing the amount of strain applied when the wings are manufactured. Airbus will change the material used to make the L-shaped bracket to a stronger alloy.

According to the EASA airworthiness directive, A380s that have at least 1,800 flight cycles (a takeoff and landing) must undergo an inspection within four days or 14 more flight cycles. Aircraft with 1,300 to 1,800 have up to six weeks or 84 flight cycles for the inspection. About 20 of the 60 A380s in service currently meet the requirement for inspections.

Cracks in aluminum parts on airliners are nothing new. Many aluminum parts develop cracks over time due to the properties of the metal. Airplanes are designed to minimize the stress and strain on aluminum components and engineers are usually able to predict when an inspection, and possible replacement, due to fatigue should take place.

The cracks found in the A380s brackets are an example of unforeseen cracks found in an aluminum part. According to Airbus the new attachment technique and new alloy will restore the massive airliner's normal expected lifespan of more than 25 years."
New Cracks Found in the Wings of Some Airbus Planes (Published 2012) - The New York Times,"Thu, 19 Jan 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTIvMDEvMjAvYnVzaW5lc3MvZ2xvYmFsL2EzODAtamV0cy1tYXktZ2V0LWNsb3Nlci1pbnNwZWN0aW9ucy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Airbus confirmed Thursday that new cracks had been found in the wing ribs of a small number of its twin-deck A380 planes, a discovery that industry officials said would most likely prompt European safety regulators to order mandatory inspections across the superjumbo fleet as a precaution.

Less than two weeks ago, tiny cracks were found in a different part of the same wing component of five A380s, including planes flown by Qantas Airways and Singapore Airlines.

The problems are viewed by the European Aviation Safety Agency as significant enough to merit closer inspection of a large number of the 68 A380s in service with seven airlines, said the industry officials, who requested anonymity because the regulators’ recommendations were not expected to be made public until Friday.

The new hairline cracks have so far been found on just two planes, both of which are owned by Emirates Airlines, said one person close to the situation who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the inspection process. Emirates is the largest customer for the 555-seat A380, with 20 of the jets in service and 70 more on order."
"EADS creates 9,000 jobs as Airbus celebrates record-breaking year - FRANCE 24 English","Tue, 17 Jan 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi8yMDEyMDExNy1lYWRzLWJvZWluZy1haXJidXMtcmVjb3JkLXNhbGVzLWdhbGxvaXMtbmV3LWpvYnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"AEROSPACE

European plane maker Airbus said Tuesday it had a record-breaking year in 2011, outselling Boeing for the ninth consecutive year. Outgoing chief of parent company EADS announced the creation of 9,000 new jobs in 2012.

AFP - European plane maker Airbus said Tuesday that it outgunned American rival Boeing in 2011, winning a two-thirds market share with a record number of aircraft orders and saw clear skies ahead.

Airbus delivered a record 534 planes, beating Boeing for the ninth consecutive year, said the firm's commercial director John Leahy.

In 2011, it won a record 1,419 orders while the company's great rival Boeing won 805 new orders, giving Airbus 64 percent of the market, Leahy said.

Airbus received new orders for 19 A380 superjumbos last year after 10 cancellations, and 26 were delivered compared with 18 in 2010, Tom Enders, the chief executive of Airbus parent company EADS, told reporters.

""A380 is in serious production. For us after all the troubles, 2011 was the first real serious production year for the A380,"" he said.

Leahy said the firm was unlikely to maintain its level of dominance.

""It isn't our goal to end up where Boeing was in 1995 with 81 percent of the market. Our goal remains to stay in a stable duopoly between 40 and 60 percent of the market,"" he told reporters.

Leahy said market share would likely return to the 50-percent mark in 2012, as Boeing readies its new fuel-efficient 737 MAX for delivery in 2017.

Airbus had a total of 4,437 orders on its books at the end of December -- an industry record -- worth some $588 billion (464 billion euros).

The company would work through its order book foreseeing 600 to 650 new orders this year, Enders said adding deliveries were expected to increase to 570 in 2012.

Leahy said the firm had enjoyed particular success with the A320 NEO medium-haul plane, which the firm says will burn 15 percent less fuel than the standard A320 -- a crucial factor for airlines at a time of high oil prices.

Airbus won 1,226 orders last year for the new plane, which will be delivered from 2015, and 1,256 orders in total since the programme took off in December 2010.

""No programme in the history of aviation has ever sold that many, that fast,"" said Leahy.

The value of Airbus 2011 orders amounted to $140.5 billion, or 54 percent of the global market. Airbus has higher production costs than Boeing and has splashed out more in research and development, notably for the NEO.

Meanwhile, the timetable for Airbus' A350 long haul passenger jet is on schedule, senior director Fabrice Bregier said, insisting there was no need to rush.

""We don't relax the pressure on the team... but when we believe we are not mature enough, when we believe there are still risks which could have effects on the next step -- we have the A380 experience we have paid the consequences for -- we prefer to stop and fix (it),"" he said.

In November, EADS announced that production and delivery of its first A350 long-haul passenger jet had been delayed by six months and would now be in the first half of 2014.

Looking forward, Leahy said he thought Airbus could navigate smoothly through the turbulence the global airline industry is facing.

Demand for planes will continue to grow given that passenger numbers tend to double on average every 15 years, he said.

""It was a tough year for the world economy but traffic has grown by six percent,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Tom Enders also saw a bright future for the firm. ""With a solid backlog and an excellent cash position, we are well prepared for the future,"" he said.

EADS chief Louis Gallois also called for the swift appointment of his successor amid German press reports citing senior EADS officials that Paris was delaying confirmation of Enders in the job in a bid to see a Frenchman, rather than Germans, at the group's financial helm and at the head of its Eurocopter subsidiary.

But Gallois said he would not push for a date or try to exert pressure over the decision.

EADS also plans to hire 9,000 people in 2012, of which 4,000 would be on temporary contracts, Gallois told reporters. That compares with more than 5,000 last year.

"Norwegian carrier buys 222 Boeing, Airbus planes - CBS News","Wed, 25 Jan 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3Mvbm9yd2VnaWFuLWNhcnJpZXItYnV5cy0yMjItYm9laW5nLWFpcmJ1cy1wbGFuZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"OSLO, Norway -- Budget carrier Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA on Wednesday said it has ordered 222 new aircraft from Boeing and Airbus in separate deals with a combined worth of $127 billion in list prices.

The total order, which includes 122 Boeing 737 aircraft and 100 Airbus A320 planes for delivery starting in 2016, is the largest ever aircraft purchase in Europe, Norwegian Air Shuttle said.

""Today is a historic day for Norwegian,"" CEO Bjoern Kjos said. ""We have secured our fleet renewal for years to come and are very pleased with the agreements with both Airbus and Boeing.""

In 2002, Ryanair ordered 100 Boeing 737-800 aircraft and took options on 50 more. The list price at the time was $9.1 billion.

Boeing 4Q profit up as plane deliveries take off

Norwegian Air Shuttle, one of Europe's fastest growing airlines, sees the acquisition of new, fuel-efficient aircraft as key to its strategy to offer low-cost fares. It has expanded rapidly in Europe, and Kjos told The Associated Press last month that it's planning to launch long-haul operations, with flights to New York and Bangkok scheduled to start in early 2013.

The deal with Boeing includes orders for 100 Boeing 737 MAX8s and 22 Boeing Next-Generation 737-800s, in addition to purchase rights for an additional 100 737 MAX8 aircraft. Boeing said Norwegian is the first European carrier to complete an order for its 737 MAX aircraft.

""The total order is valued at $11.4 billion at list prices and represents the largest-ever Boeing order from a European airline,"" the American company said.

The Airbus agreement is for 100 Airbus A320neo planes, with purchase rights for an additional 50. The neo is a modified version of the existing workhorse jet, the A320, with improved engines and modified wingtips to make it more fuel-efficient.

The A320neo lists for 96.7 million euros (126 million) each, but airlines negotiate discounts for bulk orders.

Kjos declined to reveal the price tags negotiated with Boeing and Airbus but said ""we have gotten deals that otherwise wouldn't be able to get because we're first.""

Kjos said the deals will be financed by loans guaranteed by the Export-Import Bank of the United States and European export credit agencies.

""The banks will be financing the deals against a state guarantee from the agencies,"" Kjos told AP.

Norwegian Air Shuttle shares jumped 8.3 percent to 71.50 kroner ($12.16) in Oslo after the deals were announced.

""It's a massive order which shows a big ambition on behalf of Norwegian,"" said John Strickland, director of London-based aviation consultancy firm JLS Consulting.

The challenge will be to place the new planes in routes and markets where they can fill the seats, and not end up in a situation where ""suddenly you're raking in losses instead of paying for the planes,"" Strickland said.

Unlike budget carriers Ryanair and EasyJet, which are flying from destinations across Europe, Norwegian is focused on the Scandinavian market. Last year, the airline flew about 13 million passengers, rapidly gaining ground on regional competitor Scandinavian Airlines.

Norwegian, which had previously only used Boeing planes, said it would benefit from using two aircraft suppliers ""both in terms of ensuring adequate flight capacity, flexibility and competition between two manufacturers.""

Kjos, a former fighter pilot, owns 27 percent of Norwegian, founded in 1993 and listed on the Oslo stock exchange 10 years later. After struggling to make a profit in its early years, Norwegian bought competitor FlyNordic from Finnair in 2007 and ordered 42 new Boeing 737 planes, lowering fuel and maintenance costs.

Before the announcement Wednesday, Norwegian had placed orders for 55 Boeing 737-800 and six Boeing 787 Dreamliners.

A Farewell to the Airbus A340 - Airline Reporter,"Fri, 06 Jan 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMi8wMS9hLWZhcmV3ZWxsLXRvLXRoZS1haXJidXMtYTM0MC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"I have always loved the look of the Airbus A340. In the early days of jet airlines, seeing a single-deck plane with four engines on the wing was common. By the time the A340 first flew on October 25, 1991, there weren’t too many Boeing 707s or Douglas DC-8s flying around. Even for the amateur aviation enthusiast, it has always been quite easy to spot an A340.

The engines might provide an easy tell on what kind of aircraft it was, but they also drained a lot of fuel. Airlines started to opt for two engine Airbus A330s and Boeing 777s instead of the A340. Due to a lack of demand, Airbus officially announced the end to the aircraft due to a, “changing market dynamic,” (aka no orders) on November 10, 2011.

Although Airbus is no longer making the A340, there are still four that are left to be delivered. Two are set to go to VIP customers and two were ordered by Kingfisher Airlines. It is not certain when the final four will be delivered, but I am going to bet that Kingfisher might never take delivery of their two A340s due to their current financial difficulties.

Well, times have changed with ETOPS certification and today, two engine aircraft can fly much farther away from land than they used to. When the A340 was first produced, many passengers (and probably even airlines) were weary of flying over water with two engines and the Boeing 777 wasn’t even in production.

As Boeing Randy Tinseth points out in his blog, Airbus used creative advertising to possibly play off the fears of passengers who might not want to fly over the open seas using a two-engined aircraft. Obviously any fear that people might have had was put to rest with the success of many airliners who have successfully flown over open waters with only two engines.

There were a total of 379 of the A340 ordered and 365 are still in service today. Lufthansa Airlines is the largest operator of the A340 with 51 currently in service.

“Technological achievements during the last years today allow to operate aircraft of the size of the A340-300 efficiently with two engines, what hasn’t been the case earlier,” Nico Buchholz, Head of Lufthansa Group Fleet Management explained to AirlineReporter.com. “Still, on some routes the A340-300 is still superior to it’s twin-engine competitors, with regards to payload and flight performance. In light of the huge accomplishments made, however, aircraft of this segment now and in the future are clearly twin-engines, as demonstrated impressively by B777, A330, B787 and A350 aircraft.”

Currently, Lufthansa is not planning to replace any of their A340 fleet anytime soon. “We keep on applying modifications to make them more fuel-efficient, reduce noise or make cockpit modifications,” Buchholz explained. “That being said, our fleet is economically and technically up to date and we have no huge pressure to make a buying decision here. We will decide at an appropriate time.”

Singapore Airlines only operates five of the A340 aircraft, but they are unique in using them to fly the world’s two longest flights: Los Angeles (LAX) and Newark (EWR) to Singapore (SIN). Flight SQ21, from EWR to SIN, is the longest scheduled airline flight in the world, which is 9,535 miles and takes almost 19 hours. Flight SQ 37, from LAX to SIN, is the world’s second longest flight at 8,770 miles and takes about 18 hours. Both of these flights exclusively use the Airbus A340-500 aircraft. “What the aircraft does is create a non-stop link between the US and Singapore for growth,” James Boyd, Singapore Airline’s Vice President of Communications for the Americas explained to AirlineReporter.com.

At the time that Singapore Airlines started the flights, the A340-500 was the only aircraft capable of operating routes that long. Even today, there are only two aircraft that are able to handle the route: the A340-500 and Boeing 777-200LR.

Even though Singapore Airlines also operates the 777, Boyd explained that they are not planning on replacing their A340-500s anytime soon. Recently the airline invested quite a bit of money updating all five cabins on their A340s to all Business Class, providing the same product that is found on their Airbus A380.

Singapore Airlines is unique due to operating aircraft that many see as directly competing against each other: the Boeing 777 and Airbus A340/A330, the Boeing 747 and Airbus A380, and they have the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 on order. Why? Because many of their routes are market and destination specific and each route is specifically matched up to the aircraft it uses and for them, that means a diverse fleet. Singapore’s two routes that use the A340-500s are very profitable and it wouldn’t make any sense to change out aircraft.

The end of the Airbus A340 leaves only two quad jets that remain in commercial airliner production: The Boeing 747-8 Intercontinental and the Airbus A380. As engines become more efficient, will there be more quad jets into the future? Probably not, but for those of us that get a kick out of seeing jets with more than two engines, at least we will see the A340 still flying for quite some time to come.

Airbus traces A380 wing cracks to manufacturing process - Flightglobal,"Thu, 19 Jan 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLXRyYWNlcy1hMzgwLXdpbmctY3JhY2tzLXRvLW1hbnVmYWN0dXJpbmctcHJvY2Vzcy8xMDM3MTcuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has traced the source of the cracking in A380 wing structures to unexpected additional stresses imparted by the manufacturing process, and is confident that its original flight loading calculations for the type are accurate.

The airframer is in the process of changing the manufacturing process and has developed a fix for affected aircraft, as the European Aviation Safety Agency prepares to instruct operators to conduct precautionary inspections.

But Airbus emphasises that the cracking problem - while needing to be addressed, to avoid longer-term issues - is not a safety risk in the short- to medium-term.

The cracks were originally discovered in the rib feet of the Qantas A380 which suffered an uncontained engine failure in November 2010, and has since been under repair in Singapore.

Airbus carries out A380 wing manufacture at the UK plant in Broughton, before transferring the wings to the Toulouse final assembly line. An Airbus wing specialist on the A380 said the airframer's investigations indicated that parts were being stressed at some point during the manufacturing process, which involves drawing the wing skin over the built-up rib and spar assembly before attaching it.

""It's possible to get standing stresses that hadn't been expected,"" said the specialist, which translated into additional loading during flight. Airbus has already conducted verification flights to measure actual loading, and found that its original design calculations are correct.

""We've confirmed that ordinary flight loads are exactly as predicted,"" the specialist said, and added that the components' design would remain ""completely unchanged"". But the airframer said it was changing the build process, to ensure that wing assembly does not generate unforeseen stresses.

Rib feet are L-shaped brackets, about 9in (23cm) tall, which connect the wing skin to composite rib structures. There are some 30-40 on each rib spanning the wing.

While the Qantas aircraft sustained extensive wing damage during the engine failure, engineers carried out an intensive inspection to establish whether there was evidence of damage which could not be attributed to the event.

This inspection revealed faint hairline cracks in the area where the rib foot is attached to the wing skin, running from the bolt-hole to the edge of the foot. He said a ""few"" of these feet were affected, located about halfway along the span of the wing.

The Qantas aircraft is one of the early airframes, MSN14, and the finding prompted precautionary checks on other initial-production A380s.

Nine aircraft have been inspected. Checks on another A380, during a 2C maintenance visit earlier this month, found cracks on a rib foot, in a different position. An immediate remedial solution involves replacing the affected rib feet and dropping a new section into its place.

While Airbus insists that the cracks are ""nothing of concern"", and would only need to be addressed over a period of years rather than urgently, it expects EASA to release an airworthiness directive instructing operators to carry out inspections - although the precise extent of these has yet to be disclosed.

""In the long term it would have to be fixed, but in the short term it's not a problem,"" the specialist pointed out.

Airbus said it is confident that the crack problems, originally only noticed as a consequence of the Qantas repair, would easily have been detected during a later heavy check, even if it had not been identified during earlier routine maintenance.

A380 superjumbos to undergo checks after regulator finds cracks in wings - The Guardian,"Fri, 20 Jan 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDEyL2phbi8yMC9hMzgwLXN1cGVyanVtYm9zLWNoZWNrcy1jcmFja3Mtd2luZ3PSAVVodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAxMi9qYW4vMjAvYTM4MC1zdXBlcmp1bWJvcy1jaGVja3MtY3JhY2tzLXdpbmdz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A380 superjumbos are to undergo safety checks after new cracks were found inside the aeroplane's British-made wings.

European safety regulators ordered the checks for a flaw that first emerged in the wake of an A380 engine blowout in 2010, when a Qantas-owned jet suffered a serious engine failure over Indonesia. Subsequent inspections of the Airbus aircraft revealed hairline cracks in a rib-foot – part of the metal frame of a wing.

Further cracks were then found on other A380s, but in the latest development the European Aviation Safety Agency (Easa) said a ""new form of cracking"" had now been found that was more significant than previous flaws.

Easa said in a statement on Friday: ""This condition, if not detected and corrected, could potentially affect the structural integrity of the aeroplane."" It added that further mandatory actions might be considered as the investigation continues.

It has ordered inspections for A380s that have flown more than 1,300 flight cycles – where an outbound and return flight count as one cycle – over the next six weeks. Some of the 525-seat planes, those which have flown more than 1,800 cycles, will have to be checked by next Friday.

""It has been determined that the … cracks may develop on other aeroplanes after a period of time in service,"" said Airbus.

According to the Flightglobal website, the order affects at least 20 A380s: 10 owned by Singapore Airlines, seven owned by Emirates, one owned by Air France and two Airbus test planes. There are 68 A380s in service worldwide.

The problem relates to brackets that attach A380 ribs - elongated, oval-shaped frames which run along the width of the wing - to the wing material. There are more than 2,000 of these brackets per A380 wing but it is understood that cracks have been discovered on only a few of them.

The flaw is caused by the pressure exerted on bolt holes when the brackets are attached to the ribs. Airbus has already adjusted the manufacturing process for its A380s, with the cracks occurring on planes that were among the first to roll off Airbus production lines.

Airbus said the additional cracks had been found on a ""limited number of non-critical"" rib-feet brackets. The European aerospace group added: ""Airbus emphasises that these cracks do not affect the safe operation of the aircraft. Airbus is working closely with the airworthiness authorities and its customers as we proceed.""

The A380 wings are made at the Airbus plant in Broughton, Wales.

An Australian engineering union accused Airbus of playing down the problem. ""They [Airbus] have described these as tiny cracks, but every crack starts off as a tiny crack and they can grow very quickly,"" said Stephen Purvinas, federal secretary of the Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association.

""I would be worried that Airbus aren't taking seriously the ever-increasing number of cracks being found in the wings of their A380 aircraft. Put it this way: I wouldn't put my family on an A380 at the moment,"" he said.

Qantas said the latest cracks had not been found on its planes."

26th Thursday, January 2012 - 05:19 UTC Full article

Norwegian Air currently operates an all-Boeing fleet

Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA ordered 222 Boeing Co. and Airbus SAS airliners valued at 127 billion Kroner (21.5 billion dollars) as Europe's fourth-biggest discount carrier steps up its competition with state-backed SAS AB.

Norwegian Air will buy the latest fuel-efficient models, ordering 100 Boeing 737 MAX8 single-aisle planes and the same number of Airbus A320neos, plus 22 of Boeing's existing 737- 800s, the Fornebu-based carrier said today in a statement.

The order will add capacity and pare operating costs as the carrier seeks to strip traffic from SAS, the Stockholm-based owner of Scandinavian Airlines. Founded in 1993, Norwegian Air switched to a discount model in 2001, emulating Ryanair Holdings Plc and EasyJet Plc, before adding long-haul flights last year.

By ordering so many aircraft Norwegian will certainly be positioned as one of the major players in the European marketplace, said Hans-Erik Jacobsen, an analyst at First Securities ASA with a buy rating in the stock. It will help to keep costs even lower and to stay competitive.

Norwegian Air surged as much as 15% and closed 13% higher at 74.75 Kroner in Oslo. The stock has advanced 35% so far this year, valuing the company at 2.58 billion Kroner (436 million dollars).

The order is Airbus's first from Norwegian Air, which operates an all-Boeing fleet of 48 737-800s and 14 737-300s, according to the carrier's website.

There's no issue with financing, which is supported by the Export-Import Bank of the U.S. and European Export Credit Agencies, Chief Executive Officer Bjoern Kjos said today.

Loans will comprise 85% of the order's value, requiring 15% equity, or about 10 billion Kroner, according to Per Kristian Reppe, an analyst at Pareto Securities in Oslo, who said in a note that that's likely to be provided from operational cash flow and the sale of older aircraft.

Management seemed comfortable that an equity issue would not be needed, although one could not totally eliminate such a scenario considering the size of the order, he said.

The deal is also the first in Europe for Boeing's MAX model, which the US company decided to offer last year to blunt the success of the A320neo. Single-aisle aircraft are the most widely used globally, and the neo had become the fastest- seller in aviation history as customers sought to cut costs.

Deliveries will start in 2016, Norwegian Air said, and the agreement also includes options for 100 MAX8s and 50 neos. Airbus has said it plans to provide the first neos by late 2015. Boeing's target for the first 737 MAX delivery is 2017.

Etihad cancels six Airbus A350-1000 aircraft orders - Aerospace Technology,"Fri, 20 Jan 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm9zcGFjZS10ZWNobm9sb2d5LmNvbS9uZXdzL25ld3NldGloYWQtY2FuY2Vscy1zaXgtYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtMTAwMC1haXJjcmFmdC1vcmRlcnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Etihad Airways, the Abu Dhabi Government owned airline, has cancelled six Airbus A350-1000 of its original order of 25 aircraft, but retained the option to buy wide body jets.

An Etihad Airways spokesman told Bloomberg it has a great deal of confidence in the A350 XWB programme and the company is delighted to have been able to retain attractive delivery positions for the (A350) 1000 derivative.

Confirming the cancellation of the order, a spokesman from Airbus said Etihad has cancelled some planes and said it is linked to Etihad Airways’ fleet requirements which evolve over time and can change.

Following the cancellation, Etihad Airways has options to buy 25 more aircraft from Airbus, a unit of European Aeronautic Defence & Space.



The A350-1000 aircraft is being built as part of the A350 XWB programme and it will be a longest aircraft in the family, featuring a twin-engine. Flightglobal cited an Etihad source saying the carrier was not ‘content’ with changes to the aircraft.

Airbus had previously revealed a plan to increase the size and power of the A350-1000 aircraft, leading to a delay in the launch of aircraft to 2017 from the earlier scheduled launch in 2015.

Airbus had secured orders for only ten A250-1000 aircraft in 2011, whereas cancellation of 41 left the type in negative net figures for 2011.

Cancellation of a single A350-800 had reduced the A350 order backlog to 555 aircraft, comprising 118 800s, 368 900s and 19 1000s.

The planemaker had twice delayed the introduction of the first A350-900 which is a smaller version and is now to operate from the first half of 2014 instead of July 2013.

A top executive said the European planemaker had come up with a solution to the cracks on a small number of parts inside the superjumbo’s wings, which prompted European safety authorities to order inspections last week.

Airbus confirmed a Reuters report that more examples of the cracks had been discovered during the compulsory inspections, but declined to give further details before a Friday deadline for completing an initial phase of checks.

“The A380 is safe to fly,” Tom Williams, executive vice president of programmes at Toulouse-based Airbus, said.

The cracks were caused by factors including the choice of aluminium alloy for some of the 4,000 brackets in the wings as well as a type of bolt that put too much stress on the metal.

Engineers have ruled out metal fatigue, Williams said.

Airbus moved to shore up confidence in the world’s largest jetliner amid a drip-feed of disclosures about cracking on components used to fix the outside of the wing to its ribcage.

Williams flew to Dublin to give an unscheduled address at an industry conference to dampen any concerns about safety.

European authorities have ordered inspections on almost a third of the superjumbo fleet, or 20 aircraft, after two types of cracks were discovered within weeks of each of other.

Since then, similar cracks have been found inside the 9,100-square-foot wings of at least one of the superjumbos examined under the directive, industry sources told Reuters on Tuesday.

Airbus officials said that having understood the problem, they expected most of the aircraft being tested would show similar evidence of cracks, but that repairs would solve this well before they became a potential hazard.

It declined to say which airline had reported cracks during inspections but the spotlight is expected to fall on Singapore Airlines, which has said it is inspecting six aircraft under phase one of checks involving the most heavily used jets .

The airline opened up the debut A380 service in Dec. 2007.

TECHNICAL FIX

Singapore Airlines said it was carrying out inspections as required and would give an update once they were completed. The checks involve emptying and venting fuel checks for about 24 hours followed by a visual check via a manhole under the wing.

The cracks first came to light during repairs, lasting over a year, on a Qantas A380 severely damaged by a dramatic engine explosion in November 2010 that punched holes in the wing.

At first engineers were unsure what had caused the cracks but the initial microscopic flaws led to the discovery of a second and potentially more serious type of crack, some of them up to two inches long, in the central part of the wing.

The findings caused concern at the European Aviation Safety Agency which turned down Airbus’s request for limited extra time to examine the data and ordered mandatory inspections last week.

Designed just before the latest generation of mainly carbon-composite jetliners like Boeing’s newly delivered 787 Dreamliner, the A380 is about 60 percent aluminium, the main material used for making aircraft for decades.

“All aluminium structures have cracks. It is the nature of the beast. Each component is designed and modelled according to the desired capacity,” Williams said. If one part breaks the structure is designed so that the load is spread elsewhere.

To deal with the unforeseen cracking problem, Airbus is changing its manufacturing processes to ensure smooth operation until at least the next four-year maintenance checks.

Longer term, it plans to switch to a different alloy, restoring the aircraft to its normal lifespan of 25 years-plus.

The wings were designed and built in Britain, which prides itself on state-of-the-art wing assembly. Unions there recently objected to some work being outsourced to South Korea.

Industry executives at the Dublin conference welcomed the clarification and said the problem had been understood.

“When they had the second round of cracks, that got more people’s attention and a few airlines were asking questions,” an executive said, speaking on condition he was not identified.

An Australian engineering union last week called for all A380s to be grounded pending more investigation. Airbus has dismissed this by saying regulators would be quick to ban flights if they believed safety to be at risk.

'We can't continue to gamble with lives' - engineer

Australian aircraft engineers have called for Airbus A380 - the world's biggest passenger aircraft - to be grounded, after Singapore Airlines and Qantas found cracks in the wings of their super-jumbos.

'We can't continue to gamble with people's lives and allow those aircraft to fly around and hope that they make it until their four-yearly inspection,' said Steve Purvinas, secretary of the Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association.



Both airlines, and Airbus, admitted that they had discovered cracks, but maintained that the aircraft were safe. In total, 67 Airbus A380s are in use worldwide, on seven airlines. The aircraft are in use by Qantas, Singapore Airlines, Emirates, Air France, Lufthansa, Korean Airlines and China Southern.

Scrutiny: Airbus' new A380 superjumbo has come under fire again, after Singapore Airlines had to shut down an engine and return a flight to Singapore yesterday

'We confirm that cracks were found on non-critical wing attachments on a limited number of A380s,' an Airbus spokesperson said today.



'We've traced the origin of these hairline cracks, and developed an inspection and repair procedure which can be done during routine maintenance.'

Singapore Airlines, the world’s second-biggest carrier, operates 14 A380s already and has five on order, while Qantas has taken delivery of 10 of its order of 20 A380 aircraft.



The A380 has been in service for five years. It seats 525 passengers in a typical three-class arrangement. In total, 238 of the aircraft have been ordered by 17 airlines worldwide.



The aeroplanes are assembled in Toulouse, but parts are built across Europe, with the wings being built in Broughton, Wales.



Singapore Airlines (SIA) and Qantas Airways said on Friday they discovered cracks on the wing ribs of their Airbus A380s, but said the cracks pose no threat to safety and repairs have been carried out.

The remarks came after Airbus said on Thursday that engineers discovered minor cracks in the wings of a 'limited number' of A380s, but said the cracks were not affecting the safety of the aircraft.



'Cracks were found on a small number of wing rib feet on an Airbus A380 during inspections in the second half of last year. These pose no safety issue and repairs were carried out on the aircraft,' SIA’s spokesman Nicholas Ionides said in an email.



All good: Lufthansa say it has no problems with its A380 fleet and operations continue as normal

'Repairs were subsequently carried out on a second aircraft. We have kept the relevant regulatory authorities fully informed and will be carrying out inspections and any necessary repairs on other A380s as they go in for routine checks,' he added.

Qantas separately said that 'minuscule cracking' was found in the wing ribs of the Qantas A380 being repaired in Singapore after one of its Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines suffered a mid-air blowout in 2010.



' Investigations have found that the cracking is unrelated to the engine failure incident experienced by this aircraft in November 2010 and is not unique to Qantas. It has now been repaired,' the carrier said in a statement.

'No immediate action is required by A380 operators because the cracking presents no risk whatsoever to flight safety,' Qantas said.



A Lufthansa spokesman said: ‘There is no findings on our side and we have normal operations.’

Airbus said it has traced the origin of the problem and developed an inspection and repair procedure that will be done during routine, scheduled four-year maintenance checks.



SIA, the world’s second-biggest carrier by market value and the first operator of such aircraft, operates 14 A380s and has five on order, while Qantas has taken delivery of 10 of its 20 A380 aircraft on order, according to the airline’s website.

Both Singapore Airlines and Qantas are using Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines on their A380 fleets.

A330 sharklets study follows good results on A320 tests - Flightglobal,"Mon, 23 Jan 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYTMzMC1zaGFya2xldHMtc3R1ZHktZm9sbG93cy1nb29kLXJlc3VsdHMtb24tYTMyMC10ZXN0cy8xMDM2OTIuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is looking at the potential of adapting its sharklet wing-tips to the A330 following good results from initial flight tests of the modification on the A320.

The manufacturer is also interested in raising the maximum take-off weight of the A330-200 further, to 240t.

Chief operating officer for customers John Leahy, speaking to Flightglobal Pro in Hamburg, said the airframer was ""getting better results than we thought"" from the sharklets fitted to the A320.

© Tim Bicheno-Brown-Flightglobal Sharklets on the A330-200 could nudge the twinjet's range closer to the capability of the rival Boeing 787-8.

He said initial results indicated improvements which exceeded early estimates of 3.4%.

Leahy said Airbus was ""studying"" the possibility of putting sharklets on the A330, and added: ""Right now we're still several months away from a decision.""

The process was complex, he said, because the A330 already has winglets, so the benefit of sharklets would have to be clear, and the airframer needed to analyse wing loading - particularly because it was also trying to raise the A330-200's maximum take-off weight to 240t.

He said the airframer would ""ideally"" look for a retrofit as well as new-build solution, but pointed out that Airbus could not indicate a production date until it had determined the nature of the sharklet design. ""We don't know what 'it' is,"" said Leahy.

Leahy added that Airbus would also like to raise the take-off weight of its A330-300, to ""the same"" level of 240t.

Airbus has insisted the double-decker plane, used by Emirates and Qantas airlines among others, is safe to fly.

However, European aircraft safety authorities have ordered the checks on nearly a third of the A380 fleet in service.

Hairline cracks were discovered on the wings on a number of ""non-critical"" brackets known as ""rib feet"" inside the wings during routine inspections, Airbus said.

Similar flaws were spotted earlier this month during the repair of the Qantas aircraft which suffered an engine blow-out after taking off from Singapore in November 2010.

The latest cracks have been described as more significant and it is believed that mainly A380s run by Singapore Airlines and Emirates were affected.

But Airbus's Justin Dubon told Sky News that with more than 2,000 such brackets in each wing - a total of 4,000 per plane - cracks on a small number of rib feet would not affect wing performance.

He added that the cracks were a result of the manufacturing process and not caused in flight.

Airbus aircraft are manufactured in pieces in its engineering centres across Europe and assembled in Toulouse - the wings are assembled in the UK, in the Cheshire town of Broughton.

The European Aviation Safety Agency has issued an order for A380 aircraft which have completed 1,800 flight cycles - take-off and landing - to be visually inspected by January 28.

Planes which have completed between 1,300 and 1,799 flight cycles are required to have the checks within the next six weeks.

With many of the A380 delivered to airlines recently, some of the aircraft which need repairs may still be under a manufacturer's warranty.

The world's largest jetliner, which has two floors and can carry up to 853 passengers, entered service in October 2007 with Singapore Airlines.

The A380 costs $390m (£251m) on average after Airbus announced a price increase on Wednesday."

More cracks have been discovered in the wings of the world's biggest passenger jetliner but Airbus has insisted the aircraft are still safe to fly.



The damage has been found in two more A380 superjumbos, just two weeks after tiny cracks were first reported in the wings of the 525-seat, double-decker aircraft, which entered service just over four years ago.



The initial discovery led to Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association last week called for the aircraft to be grounded amidst safety concerns.

Safety concerns: More cracks have been discovered in the wings of the world's biggest jetliner, the 525-seat, double-decker A380 superjumbo, but Airbus has insisted the aircraft are still safe to fly

'Airbus confirms that some additional cracks have been found on a limited number of non-critical brackets ... inside the wings of some A380s,' the planemaker said in a statement.



'Airbus emphasizes that these cracks do not affect the safe operation of the aircraft.'

The European Aviation Safety Authority (EASA) confirmed it would issue a bulletin Friday mandating precautionary checks.

The latest cracking problem was discovered in two aircraft during a routine two-year inspection, an Airbus spokeswoman said.

EADS subsidiary Airbus has so far delivered 68 superjumbos, starting with Singapore Airlines which took the first aircraft in December 2007, followed by Dubai's Emirates and Qantas Airways of Australia.



Other operators include Air France, Germany's Lufthansa, Korean Air and China Southern.

Reassurance: Airbus has emphasized that these cracks do not affect the safe operation of the aircraft

So big that many airports had to modify their facilities to accomodate it, the A380 was designed to challenge Boeing's monopoly of the large passenger aircraft market.



The aircraft's upper deck extends along the entire length of the fuselage, allowing for a cabin space of 5,145 sq ft - some 49 per cent more than Boeing's 747, the next largest passenger jet currently in service.



The A380 is designed for a range of up to 9,600 miles (15,400km), enough to fly from New York to Hong Kong, at a cruising speed of Mach 0.85 (560mph or 900km/h).

However, since the first deliveries of the aircraft in 2007, the planes have already been plagued with a series of problems.



A blowout in the superjumbos' Derby-built Rolls Royce Trent 900 engines led to an emergency landing of a Qantas A380 in November 2010.



Qantas grounded its Airbus fleet for more than a fortnight after the midair explosion over Singapore, which was found to have been caused by a faulty pipe.



Rolls subsequently admitted dealing with the fault, including replacing the engines on several aircraft, had cost it £56million.



Even the A380's massive size has posed difficulties. Last June an Airbus 380 lost its wing-tip in a taxiing collision with a building at Le Bourget airport Paris.



The collision mirrored an incident at JFK airport earlier that year when a private jet was spun round after it was hit by the wing of an A380.

The latest problems were discovered in the same type of part as the earlier set of cracks, an L-shaped bracket which connects the wing's exterior to the internal 'rib' structure.



A380 wings are manufactured in Broughton, north Wales, and Filton, near Bristol, before they are shipped to Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France, for final assembly.

Each aircraft is powered by four Rolls Royce Trent 900 engines, built in Derby. In total, some 20,000 British workers' jobs rely on the construction of the mammoth planes.



Industry journal Air Transport Intelligence said the brackets, known as rib feet, had been stressed during the manufacturing process and that this was being fixed.



The A380 has enough room on its wings to park 70 cars and a wingspan of 79.8m (261ft 10in).

Airbus raises prices for 2012 - defenceWeb,"Thu, 19 Jan 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuY2V3ZWIuY28uemEvYWVyb3NwYWNlL2Flcm9zcGFjZS1hZXJvc3BhY2UvYWlyYnVzLXJhaXNlcy1wcmljZXMtZm9yLTIwMTIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For 2012 Airbus has increased the average list prices of its aircraft by 3.9%, except for the A320neo family price, which rises by an average of 6.1%.

“Our new pricing reflects the strong demand for our modern, eco-efficient aircraft families,” said John Leahy, Airbus Chief Operating Officer, Customers. “With competition amongst carriers heating up, any tool that helps cut their costs will pay handsome dividends.”

The 3.9 per cent price increase has been calculated according to Airbus’ standard escalation formula over the January 2011 to January 2012 period, the EADS unit said.

Airbus 2012 average list prices (in million US$), effective January 1:

— A318: $67.7

Airbus has sold close to 11 500 aircraft and delivered over 7 000 since its first airliner entered service. Last year it outsold Boeing almost two-to-one after gambling on a revamped fuel-efficient jetliner and delivered more jets than its rival for the ninth year running, while admitting it may struggle to keep its order crown this year.

Airbus said it had won orders for 1 608 aircraft or a net total of 1 419 after cancellations, giving it a record market share of 64% by volume or 54 to 56% by value.

The tally includes over 1 220 A320neos, a revamped 150-seat workhorse launched just over a year ago and which prompted Boeing to update its own best-selling jet as the 737 MAX.

Both manufacturers have decided to inject new life into the short-haul A320 and 737 models, their biggest cash cows. They are banking on demand for fuel savings to help airlines stay alive as oil prices remain unusually high through the economic downturn.

Airbus moved first, sweeping up an initial wave of orders in the largest segment of the industry, which is valued at US$2 trillion over the next 20 years, but Boeing posted record sales of its larger and more expensive long-haul 777 mini-jumbo.

Airbus confirmed it had delivered 534 aircraft in 2011. The 5 percent rise from 2010 comes as both Airbus and Boeing plan further increases to meet demand from rising Asian economies.

Between them, the world’s dominant airplane manufacturers made industry history by delivering more than 1 000 aircraft and taking orders for more than 2 500 in a single year as Asia’s growing wealth continued to outshine the bleak Western economy.

Boeing last week reported 921 sales in 2011, or a net total of 805 when adjusted for cancellations, and 477 deliveries. The U.S. company says it has 1 000 firm and provisional 737 MAX orders and has pledged to make 2012 “Boeing’s year”.

While taking a lead against Boeing for now in the short-haul jets used by most low-cost carriers, Airbus is paying a price for delays to its 350-seat A350-1000, a wide-body jet designed to challenge the successful long-range Boeing 777 mini-jumbo.

Airbus pushed back development of the largest of three variants of A350 by two years last summer to deal with industry criticism over the size of its Rolls-Royce engines, but doing so risks losing business when gaps appear in fleet plans.

Something that could dampen Airbus’ performance this year could be continuing problems with its A380. Another set of cracks was discovered in the wings of the world’s largest jetliner, though an engineering union said it was downplaying the issue and some Asian airlines said they would develop inspection programs.

It is the second time in as many weeks that hairline cracks have surfaced inside the mammoth double-decker jet, which entered service four years ago, and their discovery is expected to lead to expanded safety checks.

Airbus said the cracks were found on a number of “non-critical” brackets inside the wings of two aircraft during routine two-year inspections, after similar flaws showed up in five aircraft in early January.

Airbus has dismissed calls to ground its superjumbo fleet over the cracks, which first came to light during repairs of a Qantas A380 damaged by an engine blowout shortly after taking off from Singapore in November 2010.

“It is embarrassing, but we will do everything to ensure safety is not compromised,” Chief Executive Tom Enders said.

Officials said the cracks most likely stemmed from a manufacturing process that put too much stress on the brackets, known as rib feet. The parts themselves were not flawed, according to specialist journal Air Transport Intelligence.

Despite being billed as Europe’s “21st century flagship,” the iconic A380 has already had a bumpy ride due to development problems and the Qantas blowout, and Toulouse-based Airbus is anxious to prevent any further damage to its image.

Airbus has so far delivered 68 superjumbos, starting with Singapore Airlines which took the first aircraft in December 2007. It was followed by Emirates and Qantas."
Airbus admits 'design flaws' in A380 - IOL,"Wed, 25 Jan 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlvbC5jby56YS9idXNpbmVzcy1yZXBvcnQvY29tcGFuaWVzL2FpcmJ1cy1hZG1pdHMtZGVzaWduLWZsYXdzLWluLWEzODAtMTIyMDQxMtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris - Airbus acknowledged a combination of manufacturing and design flaws on Wednesday as it confirmed the discovery of more examples of cracks inside the wings of A380 superjumbo jets, while insisting the world's largest airliner is safe to fly. A top executive said the European planemaker had found a solution to the outbreak of cracks on a small number of parts inside the wings, which prompted European safety authorities to order compulsory safety inspections last week.

Airbus confirmed a Reuters report that it had discovered more examples of the cracks during the latest wing inspections, but declined to give further details before Friday's deadline for completing a first phase of checks. “The A380 is safe to fly,” said Tom Williams, the executive vice-president of programmes at Airbus. The cracks were caused by a combination of the choice of aluminium alloy for certain wing brackets as well as stresses imposed at two stages of the manufacturing process, he said.

Airbus moved to shore up confidence in the world's largest jetliner amid a drip-feed of disclosures about cracking on components used to fix the outside of the wing to its ribcage. Williams flew to Dublin to give an unscheduled address at a conference followed by a series of briefings as Airbus stepped up efforts to dampen any concerns about the aircraft's safety. Airbus had already dismissed calls by an Australian engineering union to ground the aircraft, saying this had not been demanded by safety regulators who would be only too quick to ban flights if they believed safety was at risk.

European authorities have however ordered inspections on almost a third of the superjumbo fleet after two types of cracks were discovered within weeks of each of other on what Airbus described as handful of L-shaped brackets inside the wing. Since then, similar cracks have been found inside the wings of at least one of the superjumbos examined under the directive, industry sources told Reuters on Tuesday. Airbus officials said it was assumed that most of the aircraft being tested would show evidence of the second and more significant type of crack, but that their technical fixes would address this well before they became a potential hazard."
Cracks found on A380 superjumbo wings - SBS News,"Fri, 06 Jan 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNicy5jb20uYXUvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlL2NyYWNrcy1mb3VuZC1vbi1hMzgwLXN1cGVyanVtYm8td2luZ3MveHNseHIyMzMy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"European planemaker Airbus has warned that ""minor cracks"" have been found on the wings of some of its flagship A380 superjumbo jets, but insists that there is no risk to passenger safety.





The company said it had informed airlines operating the plane about the issue and recommended a way of fixing the problem during standard scheduled maintenance.





""We confirm that minor cracks were found on some non-critical wing rib-skin attachments on a limited number of A380 aircraft,"" the firm said on Thursday.





""We have traced the origin. Airbus has developed an inspection and repair procedure which will be done during routine, scheduled four-year maintenance checks,"" it added.





""In the meantime, Airbus emphasises that the safe operation of the A380 fleet is not affected,"" it said, adding that European safety regulators had approved the policy and that the plane's performance was not affected.





The A380 is the world's biggest passenger jet and a key product in Airbus's line-up as it battles its main rival US giant Boeing for the top spot in the world civil airliner industry.





The double-decker plane entered service in 2007 after years of technical delays. There are now 67 in service around the world and, while they have never had a fatal accident, there have been teething problems.





In November 2010 a Qantas flight out of Singapore lost an engine to an explosion. The jet landed safely despite damage, but the blast prompted the Australian airline to briefly ground all its A380s.

The best seats in business class on Emirates' Airbus A330 - Executive Traveller,"Mon, 09 Jan 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vdGhlLWJlc3Qtc2VhdHMtaW4tYnVzaW5lc3MtY2xhc3Mtb24tZW1pcmF0ZXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzMzDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Emirates only uses Boeing 777 and Airbus A380 planes on its flights to and from Australia, but if you're connecting in Dubai for Middle Eastern, African or European destinations you may well end up on one of the Gulf carrier's Airbus A330 jets.

Here's how to pick the best business class seats on board Emirates' A330.

The plane

Emirates has two versions of the A330: one with three classes (first, business and economy) and one with two -- just business and economy. The latter is identical to Virgin Australia's first two A330s, which fly from Sydney to Perth.

You'll know which plane you're on by the row number options you're given when it comes time to pick your seat.

If you can choose rows 1-4 in business class, you're on a two-class-plane. If your options are rows 6-11, it's a three-class configuration.

The business class cabin

On both versions, the cabin is laid out in a 2-3-2 configuration. Seats A & B are on the left, with D, E & F in the middle. On the right hand side are J and K.

The two class version has four rows, but Row 1 only has two seats, 1E and 1F, in the middle section of the front row.

The three-class version has six rows, with the front row (row 6) in its own separate mini-cabin.

The seats are nearly identical (apart from coverings) to Virgin Australia's Airbus A330s:

They're recliners rather than lie-flat seats or fully flat beds.

The entertainment is the older ""TV & Radio"" version, rather than the newer ""ice"" options you'll see from Australia. Our advice: bring a book or something loaded onto your own device.

The best seats on the plane

We've split up our recommendations across each version of the plane that Emirates flies.

Two-class version

1A 1K 1E 1F: these bulkhead seats at the front of the cabin have nobody reclining backwards into your space. Avoid aisle seats next to the window seats, though: your legs are more likely to be bumped into in this high-traffic zone.

2A 2B 2J 2K: these pairs near the middle of the cabin are the quietest, given the activity of lavatories and galley kitchens to the front and rear of the cabin.

Three-class version

Row 6: on the three-class version, row 6 is in its own separate cabin, which is a real draw. Avoid middle seat 6E, though. All three of the middle seats are slightly underneath an overhanging compartment, too, so they may feel a little claustrophobic when reclined.

Row 7: bulkhead seats in the main business class cabin, these have nobody reclining back into your space -- a definite plus.

Row 8: if you can't score a bulkhead, go for these seats towards the front of the second cabin.

The worst seats on the plane

Two-class version

E seats: avoid the middle seat in the centre row: you need to climb out over one of the aisle seat passengers without the compensation of having a window view.

2D 2F: the cabin widens here, so people and trolleys will need to change direction in the aisle -- and you're likely to be bumped into if your feet are stretched out. Your entertainment screen will also be at an odd angle.

4B 4D 4F 4J: these aisle seats at the back of the cabin will get more noise from the galley kitchens, lavatories and economy class behind.

Three-class version

E seats: again, avoid the middle seat in the centre row: you need to climb out over one of the aisle seat passengers without the compensation of having a window view.

Row 11: since this is the last row, you're more likely to be disturbed by babies behind in economy and crew passing through.

Airbus 'agrees A380 deal' with Hong Kong Airlines - SKNVibes.com,"Sat, 07 Jan 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vbS5za252aWJlcy5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXdzZGV0YWlscy5jZm0vNTE3MzfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Hong Kong, HKG) - Airbus and Hong Kong Airlines have struck a deal worth about $3.8 billion at list prices to buy 10 superjumbo A380 jets, reports said.

The European aircraft manufacturer plans to deliver the first A380 to the Chinese airline in 2015, Bloomberg said, citing Kenneth Thong, head of corporate governance and international affairs at the carrier.

The Chinese government had been threatening to block the order because of Beijing's objections to the European Union's carbon emissions trading scheme, said the Financial Times, which said the deal had nevertheless been done.

""We have no comment regarding our order intake before our annual press conference on January 17,"" a Singapore-based spokesman for Airbus told AFP, adding that the press conference was not related to any specific order.

The airline, which is backed by the HNA Group, could not be reached for comment on Saturday, but the FT said it was expected to get a ""significant discount"" on the list price.

The Chinese government is unhappy about legislation bringing airlines taking off or landing in Europe into the EU's emissions trading system."
