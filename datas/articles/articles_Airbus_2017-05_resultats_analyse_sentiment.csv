New Russian jet takes to air in bid to rival Airbus and Boeing - Phys.org,"Sun, 28 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDE3LTA1LXJ1c3NpYW4tamV0LWFpci1yaXZhbC1haXJidXMuaHRtbNIBPmh0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDE3LTA1LXJ1c3NpYW4tamV0LWFpci1yaXZhbC1haXJidXMuYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in front of the new MC-21 medium-haul jet, which has made a successful test flight, during its roll-out ceremony last June

Russia on Sunday held a successful test flight of its new MC-21 medium-haul passenger jet that it hopes will revive its troubled civil aviation industry and challenge giants Airbus and Boeing.

The plane, whose prototype was unveiled last June, flew for 30 minutes at a height of 1,000 metres and a speed of 300 kilometres (186 miles) per hour, said its makers, the Irkut Corporation aircraft manufacturer.

The plane took off from the Siberian city of Irkutsk where the Irkut company is based, said Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, writing on Twitter.

Rogozin, who oversees aviation and space, wrote as he watched at the scene: ""We're flying!""

President Vladimir Putin's press secretary Dmitry Peskov told RIA Novosti state news agency that Rogozin ""by phone reported to Putin that our medium-haul plane took wing, carrying out its first test flight.""

The president of Irkut, Oleg Demchenko, said in a statement that ""today is a historic day for our staff and for all the big team that worked on creating the MC-21.""

The jet was piloted by two of the country's most decorated test pilots, Oleg Kononenko and Roman Taskayev.

Kononenko, who has been awarded the Hero of Russia medal, said that the ""flight assignment was completed fully"" and the ""flight went normally.""

""There were no negative points identified that prevented the continuation of the tests,"" Kononenko was quoted as saying by the company.

Rogozin posted on Twitter photos of workers tossing one of the test pilots into the air after the flight.

The MC-21 can carry up to 211 passengers and is designed for the mass-market travel industry. It can fly up to 6,000 kilometres (3,700 miles), according to the makers.

Russia has its hopes set on competing with the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737, which dominate the international civil aviation market.

Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said last year he hoped the new plane ""will compete with other countries.""

The makers promise a ""new level of comfort"" for passengers thanks to the largest fuselage in the plane's class and large windows.

Irkut says it has signed contracts with a number of airlines, including Russian flagship carrier Aeroflot, UTair and the Kyrgyzstan Air Company.

Rogozin said last week the company has 185 firm orders for the plane, quoted by RIA Novosti.

The maiden flight comes six years after Russia's short-haul Sukhoi Superjet aircraft came into service in 2011. They have since suffered serious technical issues that have forced the plane's grounding.

Airbus promises self-flying electric air taxi by 2020 - CNET,"Tue, 09 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL3JvYWRzaG93L25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLXByb21pc2VzLXNlbGYtZmx5aW5nLXRheGktYnktMjAyMC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The idea of flying cars buzzing around urban areas has long fascinated people, but safety considerations make that scenario a nightmare. Airbus thinks that taking the human out of the equation can make personal flying vehicles a reality.

Being developed under the project name Vahana, Arne Stoschek from the Airbus A3 advanced technology lab said Tuesday that the company hopes to solve traffic congestion with self-piloting, flying vehicles. Stoschek, the head of autonomous systems at Airbus A3, was speaking at Nvidia's GPU Technology Conference in San Jose.

Traffic congestion in urban areas has become a global problem, not only wasting time for commuters, but also reducing overall productivity, creating pollution and using significant energy. Urban planners cope with congestion by building more roads, which does not necessarily solve the problem and takes up real estate that only sees use during morning and evening rush hours.

""We can't afford not to use the third dimension,"" Stoschek said in regards to the problem of traffic. Borrowing statistics from Uber, Stoschek points out that a trip from San Francisco to San Jose of 56.9 miles takes about 1 hour and 40 minutes in a car. That same trip using a vertical take-off and landing aircraft would cover 43.3 miles and only take 15 minutes, a huge savings in time. Uber also estimates the cost of such a trip could be only $43 in the near term, and $20 in the long term (which is much less than taking UberX), for example.

Airbus is developing Vahana around a set of practical goals, and will conduct flight tests this year. Airbus A3

Vahana is built on the idea of an electrically-powered, tilt-rotor aircraft capable of landing at heliports -- removing the need to use airports -- with capacity for one to two passengers. Rather than fantasy, Airbus engineers have worked out specifications for this type of air transport using existing technology. Using batteries, Vahana could travel about 60 miles at about 140 miles per hour. Any improvement in battery density over the next few years would increase Vahana's range.

Stoschek says Vahana will have a full-scale flight test by the end of this year.

The idea of a multitude of human pilots in personal aircraft would not work for a variety of reasons, but most importantly, the FAA requires enough space around each aircraft to make commuting a non-starter. Stoschek thinks this problem can be solved using similar technology being developed for self-driving cars.

Each air taxi would carry camera, radar and lidar sensors to give it a 360 degree sphere of awareness. As with self-driving cars, a computer would process the sensor data and identify obstacles in the path of the air taxi. Stoschek points out that unlike a car, aircraft don't have brakes. The computer would have to figure out how to get around objects like birds or other aircraft. Of course, self-piloting aircraft would likely be in communication with each other, agreeing on complementary paths.

During a presentation, Stoschek showed how his technology can recognize multiple birds in a flock at great distance.

Stoschek admits that current computers require too much power to accomplish self-piloting on a platform like Vahana, where every watt and ounce will be crucial. However, he believes that by the year 2020, hardware and software will advance enough to enable Vahana to take flight, which could greatly change how we get to work.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999332845211029}",neutral,0.999332845211029,0
Airbus Safran Launchers renaming itself 'ArianeGroup' - SpaceNews,"Wed, 17 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXJidXMtc2FmcmFuLWxhdW5jaGVycy1yZW5hbWluZy1pdHNlbGYtYXJpYW5lZ3JvdXAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Safran Launchers is renaming itself to ArianeGroup.

Long before an Airbus jetliner takes to the skies, the flawless operation of its electrics, hydraulics and flight controls is meticulously confirmed with the help of a giant test rig nicknamed the “Iron Bird.”The Iron Bird is a framework in which major working components are installed in the relative locations found on the actual airframe, brought together in a test installation comprising 170 tonnes of scaffolding arranged in the skeletal shape of the aircraft being tested. With the components out in the open, they can be easily accessed and analyzed.In the years leading up to a new aircraft’s first flight, changes made during the development phase can be tested and validated using this valuable tool. Aircraft components that function well in isolated evaluations may react differently when operating in concert with other systems – a situation the Iron Bird, with its integrated testing of an aircraft’s systems, is ideally suited to identify.With the aircraft’s primary system components operational on the Iron Bird (except the jet engines), they are put through their paces from an adjacent control room. There, within a mini cockpit, a pilot “flies” the Iron Bird on a computer-simulator through varied environmental conditions while engineers rack up data on the flight.Interestingly, an Iron Bird’s work isn’t done once the aircraft it’s testing is certified and put into use. The Iron Birds for Airbus’ A350 XWB and A380 jetliners are still in operation at its Toulouse, France headquarters facilities, where they can be used to provide insights into specific issues that arise or to test new enhancements before they are introduced on in-service aircraft.Even in the age of advanced computer simulations, the Iron Bird maintains a vital role in Airbus’ testing protocols. They may never fly, but each Iron Bird is the precursor to an Airbus aircraft that does.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999947547912598}",neutral,0.9999947547912598,0

The ICRP members are Lord Gold from the UK, Noëlle Lenoir from France and Theo Waigel from Germany. All well-versed in compliance monitoring of large corporations, they will have access to all levels of the company and will report to the Airbus CEO and Board on how to further improve Airbus’ compliance processes, policies, organisation and culture.

Tom Enders, CEO of Airbus, said: “Airbus has been building up and improving its compliance process, policies and organisation constantly over the past decade. A year ago we self-disclosed to the authorities misstatements and omissions that we had found. We have been cooperating fully with the investigations that ensued and further improving our compliance system is obviously our number one priority now. However, to embed irreproachable behaviours in all our business undertakings sustainably, we must take a hard look at both our systems and our culture. That’s why we have chosen to elect highly experienced independent experts to challenge and guide us going forward. Lord Gold, Noëlle Lenoir and Theo Waigel will support us in our ongoing efforts to put in place a meaningful change programme which addresses the issues that have been identified,” he said.

Lord Gold was a solicitor at Herbert Smith for 37 years, serving as its senior partner between 2005 and 2010. In March 2011 he set up David Gold & Associates high level strategic litigation advisors. He is one of the UK's most senior litigators and has extensive experience working at the highest levels with corporations, governments and regulators around the world. Lord Gold reviewed Rolls-Royce’s global anti-corruption compliance policies following bribery allegations in various countries. He is a Conservative life peer in the House of Lords.

Noëlle Lenoir is a specialist in competition law, public business law and economic regulations – both at the national level and at the European level – at Kramer Levin. She served as French Minister of European Affairs from 2002 to 2004, was the youngest person ever to have served on the French Constitutional Court. She has been a member of the Conseil d’Etat (France’s highest court in administrative and tax matters) since 1984.

Dr. Theodor Waigel served as Federal Minister of Finance of Germany in the Cabinet of Chancellor Helmut Kohl from 1989 to 1998, and as Chairman of the Christian Social Union in Bavaria from 1989 to 1999. He was a member of the German Bundestag from 1972 to 2002.

It is a patented solution, based on the Airbus requirements, and we are working on it. There are already some customers extremely interested, and we are waiting to finalize this model. We are waiting for Airbus to finalize the contract. We are extremely optimistic.”

Veneruso confirms that Airbus is not currently planning to raise the floor of the A380 to adjust the cabin diameter geometry in order to avoid the problem of the window seat passenger not being able to place their feet on the floor. “Airbus made their own marketing analysis, interviewed several customers, and probably they decided not to change the floor; they preferred to keep the floor as it is.”

Fundamentally, Geven’s seat is different from the version demonstrated in the full 3-5-3 layout at the Aircraft Interiors Expo (AIX) two years ago, Veneruso says, since it uses “totally different technologies. As a matter of fact, part of the investment has been to manage these new technologies. For example, for the composite we do not make it ourselves, we prefer to buy it at the moment, but the backrests here is fully composite. It allows us to dramatically reduce the weight. Some of the shock absorbers for the tests have been designed and manufactured by us with the dedicated technologies. The seat is really new in comfort and in weight. Imagine the old reclining seat was around 9-10 kg, and with the new one we are at 7 kg.”

Veneruso highlights that a similar technology has been used for the well-received 18”-wide seats at ATR, unveiled this year at AIX. Geven is reaping the rewards of previous investment in being able to design and produce new-technology seats.

“Geven today is taking the results of the last two years of investments. Well,” Veneruso laughs, “investments are continuous; we started investing and we understand that it is a continuous investment for the group. The investment has been addressed at mainly two points: research and development, and infrastructure.”

“In research and development, we invested in opening a new office near Rome, where we hired engineers exclusively to develop new products, trained normally by our people, but with a free mind to think to new solutions. The result is that they created two new products, the Essenza and the Elemento, which seem to be very successful. We are in an advanced stage of design and certification. We are completing the whole process with Airbus, and it will be fully offerable in the catalog,” Veneruso says.

For Essenza, “We have also an important flag carrier that already selected the seat for a huge amount of aircraft, for the single aisle application. Essenza is a very simple product. The idea was to have it very lightweight but with incredible comfort. If you test it at 27” it is still very comfortable, and you still have a lot of space space for legs.

Elemento, meanwhile, is a fully-featured seat that Geven is aiming at both the premium longer-range narrowbody market and widebody aircraft. “The first installation is for 2018,” on a linefit A330neo, Veneruso confirms, “and the certification is set now for the beginning of 2018.”

Switching away from the research and development part of Geven’s investment towards the money the company spent on infrastructure, “we opened another two factories with an investment of around €30 million, where we internalised more than 80% of the mechanical activities,” Veneruso says. “The reason is that we didn’t want to be chained to the suppliers, keeping our flexibility, because today Geven is so successful because we are extremely flexible. We still have 100% on-time delivery. We never missed one delivery or one day, and to do that we need to be very, very flexible. It is quite difficult to find suppliers so flexible, so we invested by ourselves in constant advantages in terms of quality, delivery, and production flow.”

Internalising such a high proportion of its supply chain has brought numerous benefits to Geven.

“For example, to make some parts in the past, we needed three different machines from the suppliers. We know what to do, we required a specific machine that in one step makes all three parts. There is an enormous improvement in terms of flow,” Veneruso explains. “What is interesting is that [our subsidiary] Skytecno prepares the trolley for the final assembly at Geven. We receive the trolley for that specific shipset at Geven. At Geven the parts are already checked and are ready for installation. They are assembled and immediately shipped, so we have an enormous improvement, meaning that for the assembly of an A320 of 180 passengers, before we needed five days, now we need one and a half days.”

“It was a nightmare to follow so many suppliers; now we have one supplier, Skytecno, owned by Geven and fully controlled by us, so they work exclusively for us, because the ownership is the same as Geven.”

Veneruso wouldn’t be drawn, however, on any news about its long-promised business class seat, Bacio (Italian for ‘kiss’), suggesting that “maybe for next year, we expect to have some news on this,” but that the seat would not be in the “first phase” of Boeing 777X business class offerability for the updated twinjet’s 2020 launch.

(Airbus) in Temecula, CA. The lease is valued at $21 million. The company, one of the world’s largest providers of mission critical communications solutions, will use the space for its North America headquarters.

Avison Young Principal Corey Martin, represented the tenant. Avison Young Principal Stan Nowak, represented the landlord, Zevo Drive Holdings, LLC. Martin and Nowak are both based in the company’s La Jolla office.

“Airbus is consolidating its operations from two other locations in Temecula totaling approximately 97,500-sf in order to achieve better efficiencies of operation, accommodate current and future expansion needs and enhance employee collaboration. Move-in is anticipated for early 2018,” comments Martin.

Located at 41995 Zevo Drive, Airbus will occupy 48 percent of the 223,360-sf multi-tenant facility situated on nearly 19 acres of land. With this latest lease, the property is now 84 percent occupied. The property is atypical for the area as it offers the ability for an 80%-plus office build-out due to its high number of employee parking spaces which are typically sought by R&D users (as opposed to industrial users that require significantly less).

Nowak notes: “The Temecula industrial market is seeing a sub-2% industrial/flex vacancy rate which posed a major challenge to identify ideal options for the tenant. This was an off-market transaction that proved to be the best and only viable opportunity in the Temecula Valley for Airbus as it had a unique requirement of an 80% office build-out. Additionally, it was an ideal fit for the landlord as there are very few R&D users in the region.”

The property is strategically situated near the convergence of the 215 and 15 freeways with direct access to the greater Orange County, Riverside County and San Diego County markets. Additionally, the facility is just 15 miles east of the Pacific Ocean and four miles west of the French Valley Airport. Promenade Regional Mall is within 1.5 miles and is home to over 100 stores including national chains, dozens of restaurants and a 15-screen Edwards Cinema. Downtown Temecula is near the property as well, and offers some of the area’s best retail, restaurant, nightlife and entertainment. Additional area amenities include multiple golf courses, resorts, wine country and Pechanga Resort and Casino.

Previously, the only way to track these aircraft was via the registration of each aircraft. That made seeing the entire fleet difficult and time consuming. With the new type codes, it is now possible to easily track every aircraft of the type at the same time.

The A320neo Family

The A320neo or ‘new engine option’ family of aircraft consists of the A319neo, A320neo, and A321neo. The neo family is a re-engined version of the existing A320 family of aircraft. The A320neo has been in service since 2016 and the first A321neo was recently delivered. The A319neo had its first flight in March 2017 and is currently undergoing testing and certification.

With a brisk breeze blowing through light smog under overcast skies, a large crowd of government officials and aerospace executives gathered to watch as the C919, white with a green-and-blue striped tail, underwent a lengthy preflight check, then rumbled down a runway and into the sky for a test flight that lasted about an hour.

The aircraft landed safely, and Comac, its manufacturer, declared it a success. But the program still has a long journey ahead. It is emblematic of China’s challenge as it seeks to become a leader in aerospace and other critical technologies like electric cars, advanced microchips and artificial intelligence.

The C919 is years — if not decades — behind aircraft made by Airbus and Boeing that are cheaper to fly and easier to maintain. Safety regulators in Europe, the United States and elsewhere still have to certify the plane before it can be sold outside China.

Air Lease Corp “very disturbed” with Airbus and P&W as delays bite - Runway Girl Network,"Wed, 17 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTcvMDUvYWlyLWxlYXNlLWNvcnAtdmVyeS1kaXN0dXJiZWQtd2l0aC1haXJidXMtYW5kLXByYXR0LXdoaXRuZXkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Early this year, Airbus assured Air Lease Corporation (ALC) that the lessor’s 2017 new-aircraft deliveries wouldn’t slip any more than had already been warned, according ALC. But with Pratt & Whitney PW1100G-JM geared-turbofan production-rate issues continuing to bite, Airbus has now further delayed some deliveries to the firm.

Speaking at the 37th Annual North America Airfinance Conference in New York, ALC president and CEO John Plueger revealed that deliveries of an unspecified number of new A320neo-family aircraft to ALC have been delayed again – this time until later in 2017. Moreover, Airbus has also pushed four ALC A320neo deliveries back into 2018.

Previously ALC wasn’t unduly concerned about the delivery delays to some PW1100G-JM-powered A320neo-family jets, but following the fresh round of bad news from Airbus and Pratt & Whitney, the lessor is now “very disturbed – particularly with Toulouse,” says Plueger.

The lessor’s concerns about Airbus’s delivery performance have grown not only because the manufacturer is delaying A320neo deliveries, but also because Airbus has delayed to 2018 the deliveries of two new A350-900 widebodies originally due to be handed over to ALC this year, according to Plueger. The new A350-900 delays are due to “fuselage and cabin issues”.

Additionally, the fact that Rolls-Royce is having to make “slight modifications” to the design of the Trent 7000 engine – the sole-source engine for the A330neo family – is having “an impact” on the deliveries of the first A330neos which ALC is due to receive next year, says Plueger. Together, all the delivery delays have pushed the lessor’s first-half 2017 capital expenditure so far below target that ALC took the unusual step (for it) of purchasing 11 used, 2009-built 737-800s from Turkey’s Pegasus Airlines for lease to other carriers, in order to meet its first-half capex target.

Revealing that ALC’s detailed analysis of the competing Pratt & Whitney PW1100G-JM and CFM International LEAP-1A engines for the Airbus A320neo family shows that the P&W engine’s fuel-burn performance in service to date has been “a little bit better” than that of the LEAP-1A, Plueger says that the PW1100G-JM is nonetheless having more initial operational teething troubles than the CFM engine. The biggest issue the PW1100G-JM has experienced in A320neo-family service so far has involved failures of some engines’ number three bearings, he adds.

For Pratt & Whitney, in trying to produce enough PW1100G-JMs to meet both the demand for initial installation on new-delivery A320neos and to replace in-service engines which have to be swapped after failures, “the issue is, can Pratt & Whitney recover [its PW1100G-JM delivery rate] in production?” asks Plueger. “The problem for Pratt & Whitney and Airbus is that far more engines have had to be allocated to the installed fleet than ever was contemplated … We do feel Pratt & Whitney will recover,” but ALC remains concerned about how long P&W’s production recovery will take.

Meanwhile, although CFM International recently informed Boeing that it had found a potential production-quality defect in low-pressure turbine disks in about 30 LEAP-1B engines and Boeing stopped flight-testing its new 737 MAX 9 temporarily as a result, Plueger says ALC is “a little less” concerned that there will be any potential impact on its 737 MAX deliveries. ALC thinks the LEAP-1B engine powering all 737 MAXs “will have a pretty good entry into service – it will perhaps be a little late, but Boeing was early” in certificating the 737 MAX 8, “so there is a little margin to absorb” any minor LEAP-1B delivery delays from CFM.

Addressing the subject of Boeing’s proposed new middle-of-market (MOM) 220-270-seat, 5,000nm-range twin-aisle aircraft, Plueger says “we do like that plane”. However, ALC thinks Airbus has “less of a product gap” to fill in that area. Airbus is discussing offering a new, single-aisle development of the A321neo featuring an all-composite wing and new engines and provisionally dubbed the “A322” to compete against Boeing’s planned MOM. Plueger also points out that the A330neo is “very capable of adapting” the A330-800neo and/or A330-900neo to provide a lower-gross weight version which would offer the mooted 5,000nm range and would also provide a substantial price reduction over the full-specification A330neo models.

Because of the runaway success of the A321neo, which Plueger calls “a blockbuster airplane”, Boeing has begun discussing a proposed 737 MAX 10 stretch of the 737 MAX 9 with airlines. However, Plueger says at that ALC “we’re not completely convinced” by the MAX 10 proposal – “We’re a little concerned about product repetition.”

Going ahead with the 737 MAX 10 would mean Boeing offering five separate 737 MAX models – the MAX 7, MAX 8, MAX 200, MAX 9 and MAX 10 – and so potential “asset values give some concern”, he says. Additionally, “The 737 MAX 10 would come very late in the [737 MAX] program … the A321neo has a huge embedded lead compared to the MAX 10,” so there would be a “timing” issue for the proposed new model.

Yet another factor which has left ALC cool on the 737 MAX 10 is that the 737 MAX 9 and the 737 MAX 10 are “pretty close” in size, he says. “A number of carriers that we’ve spoken to don’t see themselves switching to the [MAX] 10 … as an asset owner, you have to be concerned.” In taking the pulse of the marketplace as a lessor, “We [at ALC] have not yet felt a lot of response to the MAX 10 and we take our pulsing from the depth of the marketplace.”

[Friedrichshafen/Ottobrunn, 02/05/2017] – The two GRACE-FO (GRACE = Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, FO = Follow-On) Earth observation satellites, which Airbus Friedrichshafen developed and constructed for NASA/JPL, were ‘given an earful’ during recent acoustic tests.

The sound impact that builds up during rocket launches was simulated in an echo chamber with a volume of around 1,400 m³ at IABG in Ottobrunn near Munich. In four test cycles, the satellites in their flight position were subjected to a sound impact of nearly 140 decibels (dB). In comparison, a pneumatic drill produces 100 dB and the human pain threshold is 130 dB. Both satellites passed the tests with flying colours.

NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory JPL (Pasadena, California) in partnership with the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ, Potsdam) will send both GRACE-FO research satellites into a polar orbit at an altitude of around 500 km and at a distance of 220 km apart. This is a follow-on to the GRACE mission, which has been successfully operating since 2002. Both satellites will continually take very exact measurements of their separation distance, which changes depending on the Earth’s gravity. In this way, scientists are able to map the Earth’s gravitational fields.

A global positioning system and a microwave ranging system enable the distance between the satellites to be measured to within one micron. The GRACE-FO satellites will feature an additional element: a new inter-satellite laser ranging instrument, developed by a German/American joint venture, which will be tested for use in future generations of gravitational research satellites. Orbital perturbations through non-gravitational effects such as aerodynamic braking due to the residual atmosphere are determined with the help of a sensitive accelerometer.

The launch of the GRACE-FO twin satellites is scheduled between December 2017 and February 2018. Over the course of the five-year mission, measurements will be taken to provide an updated model of the Earth’s gravitational fields every 30 days. In addition, each of the satellites will supply up to 200 profiles of temperature distribution and water-vapour content in the atmosphere and the ionosphere on a daily basis.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999980926513672}",neutral,0.9999980926513672,0

International Civil Aviation Day helps highlight awareness of the importance of civil aviation in global social and economic development. In an interview, President of the International Civil Aviation Organisation Dr Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu reflects on the sector’s impressive progress against climate change and increasing efforts to improve cybersecurity.

As a major pillar of the global economy, air transport has never been more important. To ensure that all its 191 member states have access to the socio-economic benefits of safe, reliable air transport, the International Civil Aviation Authority (ICAO) has established the special anniversary theme of ‘No Country Left Behind’ for the annual International Civil Aviation Day on 7 December, 2016.

The UN specialised agency works to develop international standards and recommended practices in support of a safe, efficient, secure, economically sustainable and environmentally responsible civil aviation sector.

In October 2016, ICAO and governments reached a historic carbon offsetting and reduction agreement for international aviation. It represents a major milestone in the aviation industry’s commitment to reducing CO2 emissions, which Airbus will continue to support through its own sustainable work as well as its partnerships with other organisations.

A safe, economically sustainable and environmentally responsible civil aviation sector.

In this exclusive interview, ICAO President Dr Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu discusses the significance of the first-ever carbon offsetting and reduction scheme agreement for international aviation, a growing focus on cybersecurity and the important role industry players such as Airbus can play.

Climate change is a major topic for the aviation sector – how would you evaluate the progress made by industry to drive change?

At our 37th Assembly in 2010, ICAO’s member states agreed to pursue emissions mitigation through a basket of measures which included more innovative aircraft technologies, streamlined operational procedures to decrease fuel burn, wider use of sustainable alternative jet fuels and market-based measures. The aspirational goals we established to be met through these measures include a recurring 2% annual fuel efficiency improvement, as well as carbon-neutral growth for international air transport from 2020. Our sector has spared no effort in meeting these objectives, and indeed we have been regularly exceeding the annual 2% improvement goal. The critical role of airlines, airports, manufacturers and other industry players cannot be underestimated in this regard. With respect to the innovative technology improvements being sought under our basket of measures, I was very encouraged that the Assembly this year welcomed the development of the first ever global certification CO2 standard for new aircraft – the very first global standard for CO2 emissions for any industry sector. Considerable progress has also been achieved with respect to operational improvements, for instance by realizing more efficient take-offs and landings using performance-based navigation, bringing increased flexibility in our approaches to airspace use and route design, and by minimising congestion around airports through improved air traffic flow management. Sustainable alternative fuels also promise many benefits in terms of greener flights, both now and in the future as their adoption becomes more global. Already more than 2,500 flights have benefitted from their use, five production pathways have been certified and there have been 35 projects initiated worldwide to explore their wider production and adoption. Without a doubt, however, the most important environmental achievement emerging from our Assembly this year was the agreement on the historic Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, or ‘CORSIA’. Some had presumed that our states would agree to the CORSIA only in principle, and not in practice. But we were greatly encouraged at our 39th Assembly when states representing more than 86% of international traffic proactively volunteered to participate in the scheme from its earliest pilot phase.

What are the main challenges in implementing and monitoring such a programme?

To ensure the successful implementation of this new market-based instrument, ICAO is developing the necessary standards and recommended practices supporting a robust monitoring, reporting and verification system, eligibility criteria for emissions units to be purchased by airlines and the registries which are required. We will also be working to coordinate and provide the capacity building and assistance our member states may need to participate in the CORSIA. Since 2010, we have assisted 102 states, representing more than 90% of international aviation traffic, to prepare and submit specific action plans which help guide their local efforts to reduce aviation-related CO2 emissions. Just one related capacity-building and assistance project, financed by the European Union, has permitted 14 states in Africa and the Caribbean to develop and submit their action plans to ICAO. This same project also enabled the installation of aviation environmental systems (AES) supporting the collection and monitoring of aviation emissions data.

How important is Airbus’ involvement in supporting this?

Aircraft manufacturers play a critical role in much of our work. The aviation sector’s remarkable safety performance is very much a team effort and the work undertaken during an aircraft’s design and production is hugely influential to our year-on-year safety performance. That Airbus has opened an office the ICAO headquarters in Montreal only reinforces the strength of its commitment to be a more active contributor to our work.

What further environmental areas will you be focusing on?

In 2018, a new and more stringent standard for aircraft noise will be implemented and as of 2020 it will be applicable to all aircraft with less than 55 tonnes maximum take-off mass [A320 is 73.5 tonnes]. A new noise standard for tilt-rotor aircraft will also be implemented as of January 2018. ICAO’s new aircraft CO2 emissions tandard, once adopted by the ICAO Council, will be implemented on or after January 2020 for new aeroplane types. A new non-volatile particular matter (nvPM) emissions standard was also endorsed for development. It will be applicable for all turbofan and turbojet aircraft engines, with rated thrust greater than 26.7 kilonewtons [A320 is 90 kN] and for which the date of manufacture of the individual engine is on or after 1 January 2020. Our 39th Assembly endorsed all of these developments and furthermore encouraged governments to work together through ICAO to exchange information and develop guidance for best practices on aircraft end-of-life recycling.

Cybersecurity and safety, also within the context of civil UAVs, are two topics that Airbus and the Original Equipment Manufacturer organisation ICCAIA are currently addressing. How can ICAO help tackle those emerging issues?

ICAO is making good progress on the integration of internationally operated UAVs, or what we refer to as Remotely-piloted or Unmanned Aircraft Systems (RPAS/UAS), in close collaboration with our member states and industry. We have recently launched our new UAS toolkit so that operators, remote pilots and recreational pilots can now benefit from updated information and one-stop access to links to relevant national regulations. The overall goal with this initiative is to keep our skies safe as these operations expand in airspace traditionally occupied by manned operations. It is also very appropriate that you have asked about cybersecurity and cyber safety in the same question, especially as ICAO is convening a first-ever joint cybersecurity and cyber safety event in April 2017 in Dubai. It is imperative that our sector stay one step ahead of all related threats and risks in this domain, and ICAO is providing the leadership today to help ensure that this is the case.

Another aspect is ensuring the right electrical bonding in case of a lightning strike.“Our main role is to gather data on state-of-the-art technologies and set out specific design requirements to instruct suppliers in designing lighting systems to meet operators’ needs,” said Amelia Martin, Head of Exterior Lights.Aircraft lights are divided into two broad categories: those used to help pilots see, and those that make the aircraft visible to others.Like the headlights on a car, powerful forward-facing lights are switched on during darkness and in inclement weather to help flight crews discern the ground in front of them. Referred to as landing, taxi and take-off lights, these super-bright lamps are employed during taxiing, take-offs and landings. Other lights are used for visual ice detection on engines and wings, while additional ones illuminate areas on the aircraft with camera coverage.Lights that help make an aircraft visible to others trace their origins to maritime traditions: a red light on the port (left) side; a green light on the starboard (right) side. Complemented by flashing white and red lights in the wings, fuselage and tail, they all help to determinate an aircraft’s position and direction.Finally, aircraft have their vertical tailfin illuminated by a so-called logo light. More than just solidifying a carrier’s brand identity, such a large bright surface also makes the jetliner more visible – both in the air and on the ground.All told, there are a total of 23 external lights on a single-aisle A320 Family jetliner, and 41 on the widebody A350 XWB.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999277591705322}",neutral,0.9999277591705322,0
Airbus aims at flexible business/premium economy Butterfly seat - Runway Girl Network,"Mon, 01 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTcvMDUvYWlyYnVzLWFpbXMtYXQtZmxleGlibGUtYnVzaW5lc3NwcmVtaXVtLWVjb25vbXktYnV0dGVyZmx5LXNlYXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Convertible seating is something of a holy grail for airlines, seatmakers, and airframers. With the multiple-year lead-time required between a decision to purchase seats for a factory-fresh aircraft and the delivery of that product to an airline for its customers, selecting a cabin mix can often feel closer to peering into a crystal ball than a precise #PaxEx forecasting science. Creating flexible cabins is a way for airlines to build in adaptability to their fleet planning, especially when taking a risk on a new product.

Within Europe, this results in Eurobusiness: a row of three economy seats that are sold as a pair of business class seats, in some cases with a flip-up or fold-down side table. British Airways’ used to also winch sideways to make the seats being used wider. On Air New Zealand (and its licensee China Airlines), it’s the Skycouch, where fully padded legrests in a row of three seats flip upwards to create a sofa plinth for passengers to curl up. On Air Astana, it’s Economy Sleeper, which is like the Skycouch but without the flip-up legrests. Lufthansa takes a different approach, swapping out business class for economy seats to match seasonal variability in passenger demand. Other airlines, like Cathay Pacific, have a “strategic underutilisation” strategy where longhaul product is used on shorthaul routes.

But with the rise of premium economy on the one hand and the business class seat with direct aisle access on the other, Airbus is promoting a hybrid premium economy/business concept it calls Butterfly.

The idea, in essence, is an evolution of 2003’s Virgin Atlantic Upper Class Suite, the first business class seat offering direct aisle access in a herringbone layout, and Zodiac’s (then-Sicma) Cirrus seat from 2009 that reversed the herringbone. The difference is that instead of one seat between the aisle and sidewall pointing towards the window, Butterfly is a pair.

In premium economy mode, the seats recline, and may even move into a Z-bed position depending on pitch. In business mode, the seat function works as in premium economy, but only one passenger is seated in each pair. The seats then turn into beds, seemingly with a Virgin-style flip-forwards functionality. Passengers would then sleep with their heads towards the window and their feet towards the aisle, which is a positive for #PaxEx given that disturbances tend to come from the aisle.

The benefits seem very promising: airlines get to build in flexibility, but passengers get more of what they want on a particular route. Butterfly could be particularly useful for airlines like Virgin Atlantic that operate differently configured leisure- and business-heavy subfleets for different destinations. For those airlines with split regional/longhaul fleets, too, like Cathay Pacific or Singapore Airlines, Butterfly could offer a new way of thinking about differentiating seats and service on different lengths of trip — or, indeed, different price points.

How much less could an airline charge a passenger for a Butterfly journey with the twelve-hour segment in fully flat mode, but the connecting two-hour flight in upright mode?

The trick will be setting passenger expectations in flight discovery, search and booking. Life may be full of surprises, but passengers are already often disappointed when they move between longhaul and shorthaul business class. Airlines might well have to build on the difference between Delta One or Polaris and domestic first, or the BA version of Club World and Club Europe, to help passengers understand what they’re booking.

Butterfly’s success may well depend on a dramatic rethink of what the differences are between today’s business class and premium economy — and what the differences are between the business class and premium economy of the future.

This Is What It's Like Inside a Private Jet Designed for Billionaires - Travel + Leisure,"Wed, 24 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGFuZGxlaXN1cmUuY29tL3RyaXAtaWRlYXMvbHV4dXJ5LXRyYXZlbC9haXJidXMtYWNqMzE5LWluZmluaXRvLXByaXZhdGUtamV00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus just revealed the ideal private jet home in the sky — for anyone who has $87 million or so to spare.

The new Infinito cabin for the ACJ319neo, unveiled at the European Business Aviation Convention in Switzerland, is designed through a collaboration with luxury race vehicle craftsmen Pagani, and combines high-speed Italian design with all the comforts you'd expect to find in a VIP jet.

“In bringing together the best of the supercar and business jet worlds, we enable an elegant and seamless link for customers of both, while bringing a fresh approach to cabin design and satisfying very demanding standards,” said Benoit Defforge, managing director at Airbus Corporate Jets.

The Infinito combines natural and mechanical elements, adhering to the design philosophy of Leonardo da Vinci, the manufacturers say. The cabin's décor echoes Pagani hypercars, with soft-leather carpets and a wooden floor contrasted with man-made carbon fiber shells of furnishings and wall-frames.

There are soft curves in place of hard corners, including in the pathway between cabin sections, shell-shaped valances and curved walls between zones. Transparent glass walls can be turned opaque at the touch of a button. The ceiling of the ACJ319neo aircraft can project a live view of the skies above — or any images the owner prefers.

“Art and Science can walk together hand in hand: this is the Pagani philosophy,” said Horacio Pagani, founder and chief designer of Pagani Automobili S.p.A.. “The combination of state-of-the-art composite materials never used before in an aircraft, such as CarboTitanium, with the typical design language of Pagani Automobili, has always represented our signature. Applying our Reinassance touch into the wider spaces of Airbus corporate jet cabins is the beginning of an exciting new venture for us.”

Though prices for the Infinito cabin and any VIP cabin vary based on elements selected, retail for a fully-kitted ACJ319 plane, with VIP cabin fittings, starts around $87 million.

Airbus isn't the only company blending transport elements of a luxury lifestyle. Lufthansa Technik, which also specialises on designs of VIP cabins, worked with Mercedes Benz to develop a VIP Business Jet concept for 16 passengers, which first debuted at the Monaco Yacht Show in 2016.

That design features a welcome entrance, a galley fully outfitted for chefs onboard, and a rest area, as well as a VIP lavatory. The aft part of the cabin includes an entertainment zone combined with en-suite private bedroom. The open design of en-suite includes a free standing shower with transparent side walls and a curved king size bed with upholstered head wall.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999406337738037}",neutral,0.9999406337738037,0

JetBlue paints Airbus A320 in colors of New York City police - USA TODAY,"Mon, 22 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdHJhdmVsL2ZsaWdodHMvdG9kYXlpbnRoZXNreS8yMDE3LzA1LzIyL2pldGJsdWUtcGFpbnRzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIwLWNvbG9ycy1uZXcteW9yay1jaXR5LXBvbGljZS8xMDIwMDMxODAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"JetBlue paints Airbus A320 in colors of New York City police

JetBlue rolled out its newest special paint scheme Monday, unveiling a livery honoring the New York City Police Department. The Airbus A320 will begin flying through JetBlue’s 101-city network after Monday’s unveiling at New York's JFK Airport, the carrier's busiest base.

The “Blue Finest” livery features a bright blue fuselage before ending with the NYPD flag across the tail section. A smaller badge and shield will greet fliers by the jet’s forward boarding door.

The flag that was the inspiration for the aircraft’s tail design was adopted by the NYPD in 1919. Among its highlights are a field of 24 white stars, which represent the 23 separate towns and villages that eventually became a part of New York City. The 24th star represents New York City itself.

“As New York’s Hometown Airline, supporting our local public servants including the NYPD is part of our DNA,” Joanna Geraghty, JetBlue’s EVP for customer experience, says in a statement. “Our mission of inspiring humanity is brought to life each day through our crewmembers, many of whom are also former public servants. This mission also lives in the work the NYPD does to keep our communities safe.”

Adding to the poignancy for the carrier, JetBlue estimates up to 15% of its in-flight crewmembers have served in some capacity as public servants in positions ranging from law enforcement to first responders to military service.

“I want to thank everyone at JetBlue for honoring the hardworking men and women of the NYPD with this incredible symbol of partnership and professionalism,” NYPD Commissioner James P. O’Neill said in a statement. ""This aircraft, ‘Blue Finest,’ has the perfect name and appearance to represent those who have made it their lives' work to fight crime and keep people safe. It is an impressive interpretation of NYPD hallmarks and will spread our commitment to public safety far beyond New York City.”

JetBlue’s “big reveal” of the aircraft came Monday morning at its hangar at JFK in front of employees, “many of whom previously worked with NYPD and were specially invited to the event.”

Also on hand were ""Bobbies"" from the British Metropolitan Police Department, who were competing in ""plane pull"" charity event against teams made up of JetBlue crewmembers and local authorities from the New York Police and Fire departments. The event was to raise funds for childhood cancer research. Also benefiting from the charity event is the J-A-C-K Foundation, a children's cancer research fund established by officers from the British Metropolitan Police Department.

According to Xinhua, the first flight of the C919, assembled by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac), will be conducted at the Shanghai International Airport on Friday, but could be delayed if weather conditions are not suitable.

After a three year delay the long-awaited maiden flight of China’s 158-seat C919 passenger aircraft is scheduled for Friday, the latest step by the country to break the duopoly of Western giants Airbus and Boeing.

A successful maiden flight, followed by a series of safety certification processes, could open a floodgate for new orders for the single-aisle passenger jet, likely to generate 1 trillion yuan (HK$1.13 trillion) in business for Comac, according to Galaxy Securities.

The C919 has received 570 orders and commitments from 23 customers, mainly Chinese state-owned carriers and leasing companies.

Galaxy predicted that the jet could eventually receive 2,000 orders worth more than 1 trillion yuan.

Steven Lien, president of Honeywell Aerospace in Asia-Pacific, said Comac became a true aircraft OEM (original equipment manufacturer) after the C919 takes flight.

He added that it will be “very, very soon” before the plane enters full service.

Xinhua cited Comac president He Dongfeng as saying that the first flight could be conducted when the conditions of the jet, crew and weather are all ready.

C919 graphic Beijing established Shanghai-based Comac in 2008 as a challenger to Airbus and Boeing amid the country’s fast-growing aviation sector.

The C919, a narrow-body passenger jet, relies on foreign industrial giants including General Electric to supply key parts such as engine and avionics systems.

It initially aimed to conduct its first flight in 2014.

But the C919, expected to compete with the single-aisle Airbus A320 and Boeing 737, made its official debut on November 2, 2015 during a roll-out ceremony in Shanghai.

Since then, it has undergone a total 118 ground tests, Xinhua said.

The C919 has been surrounded by suspicions about China’s ability to create its own jumbo jet due to the lack of core technologies and manufacturers for the key parts and systems.

President Xi Jinping, during a visit to the company in June, 2014, said that China would achieve the goal of creating its own jumbo jet at all costs.

Sources familiar with the project said that the Chinese state-owned juggernaut failed to gel with its foreign suppliers well in the development of C919.

The narrow-body jet is powered by engines from French-US supplier CFM International, a joint venture between GE and Safran.

Comac’s 90-seat regional jet, ARJ-21, made its first flight in 2008, but it was until late 2015 that a first delivery of the plane was made.

“The assembly of the C919 certainly incurred a high cost and took a long time, but it was a good lesson,” said Zhangjiang Platform Economic Research Institute deputy chairman Zhu Dan. “It is part of the efforts to move the manufacturing sector up the value chain.”

In Shanghai, the municipal government has been touting its success in having attracted Comac to set up its production base in the city.

Shang Yuying, Shanghai Commission of Commerce director, said last week that the first flight of the C919 reflected the manufacturing might of the mainland’s commercial capital as it shifted its focus from low-end labour-intensive sectors to high-technology industries.

James Webb telescope and instrument module shipped by NASA from Goddard Space Flight Centre in Washington to Johnson Space Centre in Houston for final tests

Houston 08/05/2017 – OTIS (Optical Telescope Element and Integrated Science), the payload module hosting the telescope and the instruments for the giant James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has been shipped by NASA to the Johnson Space Centre (JSC) in Houston, Texas. OTIS includes two European instruments with major Airbus contributions, the near-infrared spectrograph NIRSpec built by Airbus and the mid-infrared instrument MIRI built with the support of Airbus.

NIRSpec, weighing 200kg, will be able to detect the faintest radiation from the most distant galaxies, observing more than 100 of them simultaneously. It will observe large samples of galaxies and stars at unprecedented depths across large swathes of the Universe and far back in time. Once launched, NIRSpec, known as the ‘super eye’, will operate at a temperature of -238°C. The instrument was developed by Airbus for the European Space Agency (ESA).

The MIRI instrument is a combined camera, spectrograph and coronagraph for mid-infrared wavelengths that will extend JWST’s observation capabilities to longer wavelengths, vital for the study of light from objects in the early universe or to peer inside dust clouds where stars and planetary systems are forming today. MIRI was developed by a European consortium of 21 institutes from 10 ESA member states as well as NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Goddard Space Flight Centre, led by the UK’s Astronomy Technology Centre with project management from Airbus.

“This is a fantastic next step for the James Webb Space Telescope – bringing it one step closer to launch on Ariane 5,” said Nicolas Chamussy, Head of Space Systems. “JWST will enable us to study the early Universe and peer inside dust clouds to study star formation. This spacecraft represents the pinnacle of technology for modern astronomy, and shows Airbus’ outstanding expertise in support of the scientific research that JWST will carry out.”

NASA, ESA, and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) are collaborating to develop JWST, designed to be the next step after the legendary Hubble Space Telescope. After its launch in 2018 on an Ariane 5 launcher from Europe’s spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, JWST will be the largest astronomical telescope in space. It will be able to study key phases in the evolution of the Universe in great detail – from the formation of the first stars and galaxies only a few hundred millions years after the Big Bang to the formation of planetary systems in our own Milky Way galaxy today.

BFU Interim Report: Bizjet Flipped by Passing Airbus - Fear of Landing,"Fri, 19 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vZmVhcm9mbGFuZGluZy5jb20vYWNjaWRlbnRzL2JmdS1pbnRlcmltLXJlcG9ydC1iaXpqZXQtZmxpcHBlZC1ieS1wYXNzaW5nLWFpcmJ1cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Bundesstelle für Flugunfalluntersuchung (BFU) also known as the German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident Investigation, released a preliminary report on the Bombadier CL604 which encountered extreme wake turbulence in January.

I usually wait for the final report but, in this case, it is very straight-forward and I’d be surprised if further details will come to light. The conclusion seems pretty clear although I will revisit that when the final report comes out.

On the 7th of January 2017, two aircraft departed for routine flights: one twin-engine Bombadier CL-600-2B16 (604 variant) business jet and one Airbus A380-861, the world’s largest passenger airliner.

At 06:52UTC, the CL604 departed Malé airport on the Maldive Islands for a flight to Al-Bateen, United Arab Emirates.

At 06:55 UTC, the Airbus A380 took off from Dubai Airport, United Arab Emirates, for a flight to Sydney, Australia.

The flight crew of the CL604 turned the autopilot on as they climbed away to their cruise level at FL340 (34,000 feet). The flight attendent unfastened her seat belt and left the jump seat as they climbed through FL100.

After a short time in the cruise, the aircraft entered the Mumbai FIR where they received clearance to fly to their next reporting point.

Meanwhile, the Airbus was flying a southerly heading at FL350 (35,000 feet).

The aircraft flew towards each other over the Arabian Sea. In the Mumbai FIR between FL290 and FL410, the standard vertical separation is 1,000 feet. The Airbus A380 was at 35,000 feet and the CL604 at 34,000 feet.

It was a clear day of very good conditions. The captain of the CL604, who was the Pilot Flying, had the autopilot engaged. He saw the opposing aircraft on his Traffic Collision Avoidance Service (TCAS) display at a thousand feet above. He looked out and recognised the aircraft as an Airbus A380. He was able to see the Emirates livery and pointed it out to the first officer.

A little less than two hours after take-off, over the Arabian Sea at about 500 nautical miles from land, the Airbus A380 flew over the CL604. The larger aircraft passed slightly to the left and above them flying in the opposite direction.

It was about a minute later when the CL604 shuddered as they hit the wake turbulance.

The CL604 began to roll slightly to the right. Both pilots actuated the aileron in order to stop the aircraft from rolling. The aircraft began to travel faster. The right bank angle increased and one second later, the aircraft was angled 40° to the right. The aileron deflection to the left increased to 20° and the verticle acceleration increased to 1.6 g.

One second later, the vertical accdeleration changed to negative 3.2 g.

To make sense of this, I looked up typical g-forces. At 1.6 g, the force would be slightly more than on the Bugatti Veyron from 0 to 100 km/h in 2.4 seconds.

I couldn’t find anything for -3.2 g, however, other than the general example of negative g-force as a fully inverted roller coaster accelerating towards the ground. Negative g-forces are much more dangerous and the negative g level that aerobatic pilots risk is usually limited to around -2 or -3 g. Blood vessels in your eyes and brain swell up and may burst as your blood pressure increases. After a few seconds, your vision will go red. If the negative g-force is not quickly reduced, blindness can occur. And as with any extreme g-forces, death will follow soon after.

The aircraft accelerated and the pitch angle changed wildly from 3° to 1° to 9° to -20°, all this in just a few seconds. There was a rudder deflection to the left at 11.2° while the bank angle of the aircraft shifted from 42° right to 31° left.

The aircraft continued to roll. The captain’s headset flew off of his head. The Quick Reference Handbook flew around the cockpit, with individual pages coming loose and scattering about. The Inertial Reference Systems, the Flight Management System and the attitude indication (artificial horizon) failed.

The indicated airspeed dropped from 277 knots to 248 knots. The lateral acceleration reached 0.94 g left and the autopilot disengaged.

The aircraft descended rapidly, losing 8,700 feet over 30 seconds. The speed increased to 330 knots. The flight crew, desperately trying to regain control of the aircraft, extended the spoilers and then retracted them again. They reduced the power in the left engine as the Interstage Turbine Temperature increased. Nine seconds later, it had reached 850°. The left engine shut down. The aircraft rolled at least three times and possibly five.

The flight attendant was standing in the middle of the cabin as the Airbus passed overhead. Four of the six passengers were out of their seats. It was obviously a very confused experience but her recollection was that the aircraft had turned three times around its longitudinal axis. She was thrown against the ceiling and the seats, breaking her nose in the process. The four passengers out of their seats were also thrown violently around the cabin. One suffered head injuries and a broken rib, another fractured a vertebra. The armrests of the front four seats fractured and bent. The seats and the panelling were damaged and covered with blood. Oxygen masks fell from their casings.

With the sky and the water both the same shade of blue, the captain said that he was only able to recognise which way was up by finding the clouds.

Finally, the captain regained control and the pilots managed to reactivate the Inertial Reference Systems using a memorised checklist. Thirty minutes after the Airbus 380 had passed over them, they were flying straight and level again. The flight attendent informed the pilots of the situation in the cabin and attempted to reassure the passengers.

The captain contacted Mumbai air traffic control and declared an emergency, reporting their position, altitude and their intention to divert to Oman.

The flight crew restarted the engine and initiated a climb to FL250 (25,000 feet). It was over an hour after the initial upset that they were able to re-engage the autopilot and resume normal flight.

Mumbai ATC contacted Omani ATC to let them know that the CL604 was at FL230 and diverting to Oman, initially explaining that the low altitude was because of an engine failure.

The Airbus A380 continued to Sydney without incident.

At 11:05 the CL604 landed safely at Muscat Airport in Oman.

After landing, four passengers were transported immediately to the hospital in Muscat. Two other passengers and the pilots, all of whom were seated with seatbelts on at the time, were unharmed.

The interim report concludes with what at first glance would seem to be old information. In 2003, a steering group was set up to specify safety requirements, to ensure that the Wake Vortex Encounter risk from the Airbus A380 would be acceptable. They found that during the cruise, the Wake Vortex from the Airbus A380 could descend more than 1,000 feet. The highest risk for a Wake Vortex Encounter – although considered low risk in absolute terms – was for aircraft flying “counter-flow parallel tracks vertically separated by 1000 feet”. They reported that some Wake Vortex Encounter incident reports indicated that moderate to severe Wake Vortex Encounters could be encountered by current operational aircraft.

Such encounters have very low probabilities, but controllers and pilots should be aware that if they occur then the encountering aircraft may experience significant accelerations. Though this is not an A388 specific issue, and it is beyond the scope of this group, the Work Group strongly recommends review, as a matter of urgency, of spacing for non-Heavy encounters that climb or descend behind all Heavy aircraft generators (including the A388).

It’s uncomfortable to think that fourteen years later, and ten years after the Airbus A380 was introduced into commercial service, this urgent issue was not reviewed. It seems that a dangerous incident had to happen for the risk of heavy wake turbulance to be revisited.

The final report isn’t due until January 2018 but I think it is safe to say that the BFU will be pushing for reconsideration of the minimum separation in light of the wake vortex of modern heavy aircraft like the Airbus A380.

Airbus delivers 3 H135s to SAF Group for EMS operations - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 03 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1cy1kZWxpdmVycy0zLWgxMzVzLXNhZi1ncm91cC1lbXMtb3BlcmF0aW9ucy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters has completed deliveries of three H135s, the latest version of its family, for emergency medical service (EMS) operations by SAF Group. The first aircraft is in service in Toulouse, France, while the second and third helicopters are destined to perform EMS missions in Alençon and Besançon.

These helicopters are the very first H135s to be used in the EMS role in France.

“We are very happy with the additional capabilities, including night flying, further reduced sound levels, and increased payload, that the H135 is providing us for these critical missions,” said Christophe Rosset, CEO of SAF. “We require helicopters with a high level of reliability and availability, always ready to transport critical patients 24/7 from an accident site or from one hospital to another and the H135 meets our stringent requirements.”

SAF Hélicoptères operates seven days a week for all types of civilian rescue and protection operations, alongside safety services with a fleet of 40 Airbus helicopters including 27 EC135s — an earlier variant of the H135 family.

“We are proud that SAF group has decided to renew their trust in Airbus Helicopters’ products,” said Olivier Michalon, senior vice president and head of sales in Europe. “The H135, with its large and flexible cabin best suited for treating patients, and the lowest direct maintenance cost in its class, is the reference for emergency medical services.”

A light twin-engine helicopter, the H135 is the latest upgrade version of its family. The new model’s improved features include increased flight performance in hot and high environments, at sea level, during CAT A missions and in one engine inoperative (OEI) situations. This was achieved by enlarging the rotor, modifying the air intake, modernizing the full authority digital engine (or electronics) control (FADEC) flight control software and adding new features to the cockpit.

The maximum take-off weight (MTOW) is increased by 30 kilograms to 2,980 kilograms. These measures dramatically improve flight performance, power reserves and safety margins.

A helicopter can cover distances three to five times faster than a ground vehicle. Being able to land as close as possible to the accident site and transport a medical team quickly to the patient can make all the difference. Airbus Helicopters, with 60 percent of the market share, is the uncontested leader of the EMS market.

Approximately 1,200 Airbus helicopters are currently in service worldwide for EMS missions.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.978841245174408}",positive,0.978841245174408,1
Airplane foot bins: The key to solving cabin storage problems? - CNN,"Mon, 22 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLWZseS15b3VyLWlkZWFzLWNvbXBldGl0aW9uLWZvb3QtbG9ja2VyL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAVRodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi90cmF2ZWwvYXJ0aWNsZS9haXJidXMtZmx5LXlvdXItaWRlYXMtY29tcGV0aXRpb24tZm9vdC1sb2NrZXI?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CNN —

The frenzy to stuff gear into the overhead lockers is one of the most maddening aspects of modern air travel, but imagine if you had your own personal storage area.

What if you didn’t have to spread your belongings between lockers 10 rows apart and then dodge and weave to retrieve them in the face of a muttering torrent of de-planing passengers.

How about your own compartment in the floor to store essential items, free up overhead space and stop the cabin crew telling you off for gear strewn around your feet?

This simple solution to airplane storage space has won a team of students from the University of Hong Kong a $33,700 prize as winners of Airbus’ fifth Fly Your Ideas competition.

‘Improved passenger experience’

Simple but effective: Foot bins could end battles for storage space. Airbus

The plan for a hinged bin could be rolled out on airlines around the world after judges were taken by the innovative idea, submitted by Team DAELead.

“The judges were impressed by the vision and skill of Team DAELead in seeing such a simple but effective solution for improved passenger experience,” says a statement on the Fly Your Ideas website.

“The new aircraft cabin design fully utilizes the space between the cabin floor and the cargo ceiling to give the passengers their own personal luggage space.”

In the competition, students worldwide are challenged to create solutions in five key areas of the aviation industry – business models, flight operations, passenger experience, design engineering and manufacturing.

Nearly 5,500 students registered for the 2017 competition and 356 teams entered the first of three rounds.

Five teams were invited to the finals week in Toulouse, France, to develop their prototypes with Airbus experts.

The runners up, Aquarius, from Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT), developed an idea to turn a military A400M aircraft into a wildfire-fighting machine.

Since the Fly Your Ideas competition launched in 2008, more than 20,000 students from over 650 universities in over 100 countries worldwide have taken part.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8751565217971802}",neutral,0.8751565217971802,0

But whether the MC-21 will really be able to compete with similar planes from Boeing and Airbus is not yet clear.

Russian pilots completed a successful test flight of the country's new MC-21 medium-haul passenger jet on the weekend amid hopes the nation could revive its troubled civil aviation industry and challenge giants Boeing and Airbus.

Co-pilot Oleg Kononenko, one of Russia's most decorated test pilots, said the 30-minute flight in Siberia went well.

""There were no negative points identified that would prevent the continuation of tests,"" Kononenko was quoted as saying by the Irkut Corporation plane manufacturer.

More comfort

The MC-21, also known as MS-21 in the West, can carry a maximum of 211 passengers and is designed for the mass-market travel industry to compete with Boeing's 737 and Airbus' A320 as Russia intends to reduce its dependence on Western technology amid ongoing sanctions over its perceived role in the Ukraine conflict.

The makers of the MC-21 promised a ""new level of comfort"" for passengers thanks to the largest fuselage in the plane's class and extra-large windows.

Irkut said it had already signed contracts with a number of carriers including Russian flagship airline Aeroflot and the Kyrgyzstan Air Company.

The test flight came six years after Russia's short-haul Sukhoi Superjet aircraft went into service. It has since suffered serious technical issues that have forced the plane's grounding.

"For the First Time, Allegiant Air Learns What It’s Like to Configure a New Airplane - Skift Travel News","Thu, 04 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMTcvMDUvMDQvZm9yLXRoZS1maXJzdC10aW1lLWFsbGVnaWFudC1haXItbGVhcm5zLXdoYXQtaXRzLWxpa2UtdG8tY29uZmlndXJlLWEtbmV3LWFpcnBsYW5lL9IBc2h0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMTcvMDUvMDQvZm9yLXRoZS1maXJzdC10aW1lLWFsbGVnaWFudC1haXItbGVhcm5zLXdoYXQtaXRzLWxpa2UtdG8tY29uZmlndXJlLWEtbmV3LWFpcnBsYW5lL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Did you know how much effort went into designing a plane's cabin? Skift got the scoop from Allegiant Air, which will take its first new airplane from Airbus later this month.

On 18 planes in Allegiant Air’s fleet, a bright orange stripe runs along the overhead bins, stretching from front door to the rear bathrooms. It’s an accent familiar to anyone who has flown EasyJet, the European discounter.

For its 20-year history, Allegiant, one of three ultra low cost U.S. airlines, has bought used airplanes. First, the airline took gas-guzzling MD-80s, but more recently it has preferred newer and more fuel-efficient Airbus A319s and A320s. They often come from EasyJet and three other airlines — Iberia and Vueling in Spain, and Cebu Pacific in the Philippines.

United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and Delta Air Lines — all used-plane buyers — often spend months and significant sums reconfiguring cabins so they look identical to their other aircraft. But usually, planes join Allegiant’s fleet looking as they did when they flew from Manila to Butuan for Cebu Pacific, or from London to Palma de Majorca for EasyJet.

Removing extras other airlines added — like orange stripes — is expensive, and Allegiant CEO Maury Gallagher figures passengers prefer cheap tickets more than matching interiors. Recently, Allegiant started retrofitting clear outliers, like one plane with an unusual tree pattern on its side walls. But when possible, it prefers only to paint the outside of planes, replace the carpet, and add seats and row numbers. Overhead bins don’t get touched.

“We just took what we could get,” Brian Davis, Allegiant’s vice president for marketing, said of the company’s historic strategy. “Our customers didn’t care.”

Given Gallagher’s frugality, few expected Allegiant would buy new planes. But the used market can be tricky because airlines only can acquire aircraft when another carrier or a lessor will sell. Last year, Allegiant wanted planes faster so it ordered 12 new Airbus A320s, and the first delivery is May 15. They’re not as cheap as used ones, but Allegiant likely got a good deal since Airbus soon will stop making the A320 in favor of a next-generation model, the A320neo. It’s like buying last year’s car model after it has been discontinued.

As part of the purchase price, Airbus configures each plane as the customer wants, including sidewalls, seats, carpeting, bathrooms, door handles, and the languages on emergency exit signs. Airbus often offers hundreds of options for each choice — enough to overwhelm employees at an airline as small as Allegiant. It has fewer than 100 aircraft.

“For every surface you see in an airplane,” Davis said, “there is a room of swatches and color palates.”

Other airlines send teams to Airbus’ Toulouse, France offices to ensure interiors meet the carrier’s standards. But Allegiant had no team, so Davis tapped one person — Kimberly Schaefer, the public relations manager — to fly to Europe to make decisions. Some carriers spend years selecting options, but because Allegiant had less than a year from order to delivery, Schaefer had a compressed schedule.

And as much as Airbus helped, the process was still daunting — less like buying a car and more like building a house, Davis said.

“They kind of walk you through the process and say, ‘Now its time to make these 14 decisions,”‘ Davis said. “That’s when we open the catalogue and say, ‘Oh, shit, there are many, many options.’”

Before she left for France, Schaefer received advice from two executives. Davis asked her to match Allegiant’s brand standards, while Jude Bricker, Allegiant’s COO, reminded her she represented a “utilitarian brand,” and told her to stay on budget. She would not be selecting in-seat television screens, nor onboard internet.

“Don’t go out and a spend a bunch of money,” Bricker told her.

How to Get Easy Orange

Davis and Schaefer tried to keep it simple. When feasible, Allegiant would select packages, and add features already on used planes, such as EasyJet’s orange stripes. Davis likes them because the shade closely matches the color in Allegiant’s sun logo.

“It’s not obnoxiously orange,” he said.

But getting the stripe was surprisingly complicated. After Schaefer asked Airbus for it, she learned the hue was called “Easy Orange,” and Allegiant could not use it because Easy Group, the European airline’s parent, owned it. Airbus sent Schaefer swatches of similar colors, but she didn’t like them. “They were too yellow or too red,” she said.

Briefly, Schaefer considered orange mood lighting in place of stripes, but learned the lights are expensive. “The folks at Airbus were like, ‘You definitely don’t want to do that. It’s going to be way outside your budget.”’

Eventually, Allegiant executives contacted Easy Group, and the two companies reached a deal. Easy Group sent Airbus a letter showing Allegiant could use “Easy Orange” below the bins.

The rest of the interior was easier, since Airbus offers packages that include most of the basics.

Schaefer picked one called the “Enhanced Cool,” a conservative scheme featuring white sidewalls with a pattern of small gray squares. Most European and American airlines prefer something similar, and a version of this package is installed on all but eight of Allegiant’s used Airbuses. Another package, called the “Enhanced Warm Scheme,” is based on sand-like colors, and popular among Middle East and African airlines.

The package covered many elements, including bins, window panels, flight attendant jump seats, the bathroom and cockpit doors, and the toilet. Had she not selected it, Schaefer might have customized everything — even bathroom door handles.

“They could really do anything that you want as far as the design,” Schaefer said. “The door itself is the door itself. But you can really have any door handle that you want. It can be made of solid gold covered in diamonds.”

Or, as Davis put it, “If you said, ‘I want purple elephants on my side walls, they would do that for you.”‘

How long should the bathroom water run?

Designing the bathrooms was a bigger challenge.

First, Schaefer wanted an orange stripe in them because the former EasyJet planes have it. But she learned it would cost extra, so she skipped it. Then she turned her attention to choosing one of 111 options for “non-textile flooring.” Airbus sent sample swatches, and she flipped through them — a task she likened to searching for wallpaper samples at Home Depot or Lowe’s.

She skipped fake wood, preferring a composite navy pattern called Atlantis, with raised round dots, an option she wanted for safety. “It’s more slip resistant than a smooth surface,” she said. The dots are small, and Schaefer is hopeful that’ll make floors easier to clean. “The spaces between the dots are large enough that dirt or other material will not become embedded,” she said.

For counters, Schaefer picked a fake stone — one of 25 options offered by Airbus— called “duocolor white.” For sinks, she preferred stainless— for simplicity sake. Stainless was the only option Airbus offered for all three bathrooms, two in the back, and one in front.

Next, Schaefer determined how long sink water would flow from the automatic faucet. She went with 10 seconds — enough, she hopes, so passengers can wash their hands without wasting water. If that’s not enough, it’s possible to change the time to 15 seconds.

She jokes that selecting the water run time made her a more discerning traveler.

“I just flew back yesterday from Dallas on American on an A321,” Schaefer said. “Their water seems to run a little longer. It’s so weird. I have the weirdest job.”

Row 13?

For weeks, Airbus peppered Allegiant with minor questions. What light bulbs did it want? Would it have a row 13? Would exit and other signs be mounted only in English? Or Spanish, too? How would Airbus paint the aircraft’s exterior?

The row 13 question was easy. Allegiant will have one, though some carriers, including United Airlines, do not.

“It makes the most sense,” Davis said. “And nobody raised an objection.”

Spanish proved trickier. At first, Davis thought the answer was obvious. Allegiant flies charters to Mexico, and may add scheduled flights, so it wanted Spanish signs. Since some of the used planes already have Spanish, Davis figured new planes should match the old. “We thought, ‘Oh, great, we already have Spanish, so we can fly to Mexico,'” he said.

The problem? Mexican Spanish is slightly different than what’s spoken in Europe, and Allegiant executives learned signs on the former Iberia planes weren’t perfect for Latin America. After some discussion, though, they went with consistency. New planes will match Iberia’s signs.

Row numbering was another vexing issue. Some airlines only put numbers on a light above the seats, near the air vents, while others add them to overhead bins.

Numbers on lights are a standard option, but Davis is 6 feet 2, and when he flies on an airplane with seat numbers on lights, he can’t see them without bending down. Allegiant seeks to board planes quickly, and Davis said inconveniently placed numbers can confuse passengers and slow boarding.

“They kind of stop at the front of the airplane as they are trying to figure out how to sit,” he said. “You don’t want it taking a few seconds to find your seat number.”

Allegiant not only will put numbers on bins, but it also will use more prominent placards than usual. Big numbers were among the few features Allegiant paid extra for, along with a public address system that can make recorded announcements in two languages.

“It sounds crazy, but it makes a huge difference,” Schaefer said of the row numbers. “That was a conscious decision. We thought if we could expedite boarding, it would help our turn times.”

Then there was exterior paint. Allegiant has a blue tail with a sun on it, and the sun fades from yellow, in the center, to orange at the edges. But it’s not a true fade. Instead, Allegiant uses sets of hexagonal dots to create the yellow-to-orange fade.

Airbus paints new planes, and it we wanted to give Allegiant’s a real fade. Or, more specifically, it didn’t like Allegiant’s approach. “Their engineers refused to paint it with the hexagonal dots,” Davis said, because they feared producing an “inferior product.”

Airbus would send photographs of other airline paint schemes, and Davis acknowledged Airbus’ approach produced a better-looking airplane. But he didn’t want customers in Orlando to notice two tails with an Airbus sunburst and six more with hexagonal dots.

He also knew airlines and lessors who sell used planes to Allegiant would not follow Airbus’ process in the future. Sellers paint aircraft in paint shops worldwide, and consistency is a challenge.

Finally, Allegiant persuaded Airbus to match existing planes for the dozen new aircraft.

“They believe their fade to be superior,” Davis said. “We said, ‘While your 12 may look better, they are also going to look different.'”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999685287475586}",neutral,0.9999685287475586,0
New Airbus Infinito Jet Offers Infinite “Sky Ceiling” Views - BOSS Magazine,"Wed, 31 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYm9zc21hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9uYWlyYnVzLWluZmluaXRvLWpldC1pbmZpbml0ZS1za3ktY2VpbGluZy_SAUpodHRwczovL3RoZWJvc3NtYWdhemluZS5jb20vbmFpcmJ1cy1pbmZpbml0by1qZXQtaW5maW5pdGUtc2t5LWNlaWxpbmcvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Reading Time: 3 minutes

Ever wanted to travel in a supercar in the sky? Airbus and Pagani collaborated on the most luxurious private jet yet.

Airline manufacturer Airbus has partnered with Italian supercar maker Pagani Automobili to create a new jet with an interior so luxurious it will feel as if you are flying inside one of Pagani’s multi-million dollar carbon fiber hypercars.

Airbus revealed the interior for their ACJ319neo (nicknamed Infinito) —during the European Business Aviation Convention and Exhibition.

“In bringing together the best of the supercar and business jet worlds, we enable an elegant and seamless link for customers of both, while bringing a fresh approach to cabin design and satisfying very demanding standards, said Managing Director at Airbus Corporate Jets Benoit Defforge.

The Interior

The private jet is designed with sleek glass walls to accentuate floor to ceiling lighting stretches and separate the cabin sections. The glass also has the option to be made opaque. Almost every inch of the interior is comprised of carbon fiber, wood, or leather—much like a Pagani Huayra. It boasts a lounging area with a large TV and plenty of legroom, a full bathroom with a shower, a dining area for six, and a bar.

What sets this private jet apart is its one-of-a-kind “sky ceiling”. For obvious security reasons the ceiling is not made of actual glass, but rather a massive display designed to simulate a marvelous view of the skies above. Or any of other images the passengers prefer, for that matter.

The concept is meant to give the passenger an infinite sense of airlessness and space.

“Art and science can walk hand in hand: that is Pagani’s philosophy,” explained Pagani Founder Horacio Pagani. “The combination of top-level composite materials in an aircraft, such as carbotitanium, with Pagani Automobili’s typical design language, represents our company’s signature. applying our renaissance touch on Airbus’s spacious corporate jet booths is the beginning of an exciting adventure for all of us.”

Cost and Capacity

The Infinito features the latest in aerodynamics and ultra-efficient turbofan engines. The jet is designed to function at airports with rough conditions, such as high heat, short runways, and high altitude.

Additionally, the A319neo is able to transport up to eight passengers a span of nearly 7,800 miles—that’s 15 hours non-stop. For all of this, the Airbus A319neo itself—minus the Infinito interior—costs a whopping $99.5 million.

Airbus’ jet and its luxurious features are designed to cater to those who prefer traveling in optimal comfort and style. Anyone will have a hard time passing up a chance to travel the skies with Airbus Infinito’s marvelous views surrounding them.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999897480010986}",neutral,0.9999897480010986,0
Air France among A380 operators studying 11-abreast layout - Runway Girl Network,"Fri, 05 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTcvMDUvYWlyLWZyYW5jZS1hbW9uZy1hMzgwLW9wZXJhdG9ycy1zdHVkeWluZy0xMS1hYnJlYXN0LWxheW91dC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"How low will they go? That’s a reasonable question to pose to airlines now that some legacies are further tightening seat pitch – see American’s planned 29” pitch on three rows of the Boeing 737 MAX – and many are accepting delivery of long-haul aircraft with ultra-high-density configurations. During Air France’s recent Boeing 787-9 delivery flight from Boeing South Carolina to Paris, your author asked the question of management.

For starters, Air France has precisely zero interest in following the likes of French leisure carrier Air Caraibes and adopting a 10-abreast configuration for its forthcoming Airbus A350s (10-abreast A350s were initially advertised as featuring a super-snug 16.4″ seat width, though the airframer later said it was working to make the layout a smidge more comfortable).

“No. It is not our product. We will not do that to our passengers,” assured Nicolas Bertrand, VP Air France Fleet Management.

Interestingly, however, Air France does not believe passengers will notice the difference between its 9-abreast Boeing 787s (with 17”-wide economy class seats and 31” pitch) versus the forthcoming 9-abreast A350s with 18” seat width.

Is it a concern that passengers will make unfavorable comparisons between the two types, RGN asked? “No, I don’t think so,” said Bertrand. “I don’t think there is such a big difference … You know for the passengers, [it’s] difficult for them to recognize an aircraft…”

While Air France doesn’t seem interested in dipping below a 17” seat width for passengers, the carrier is studying an 11-abreast configuration for its A380 flagship aircraft. This despite the fact that some people shudder at the thought of being seated in the middle of 5 seats in a 3-5-3 configuration, and wonder about the living space of the window seat.

“We will retrofit our A380 cabin around 2020 because our priority today is to [retrofit the] 777s and then the A330s at the end of next year. But in 2020, yeah we’re studying a project to retrofit the cabin. And we are studying all possibilities including 11-abreast,” Bertrand revealed to Runway Girl Network.

A decision has not yet been taken, he said, but added that,

We are not the only one. Many of us [A380 operators] are looking at it.

Air France is also eyeing some of the “other options” aimed at densifying the A380, he said, including changes to the “stairs” (read details about Airbus’ new A380 ‘cabin enablers’ here). “If it will bring value to the aircraft, if we can densify the aircraft without [taking] too much comfort from the passenger, yes why not?”

Passengers craving more space and comfort have the option of selecting Air France’s premium economy product, which is positioned 7-abreast on the 787 and features an enhanced 40” of seat pitch (versus 38” on the 777s). “So with this configuration [on the 787-9], it was optimal because business class is between door one and door two; then we have three rows of premium economy and the economy [cabin]. It was the optimum for this aircraft,” said Bertrand.

Overall, the carrier has received “very good feedback from our customers” for its premium economy offering across types; the product was first introduced in 2009. “We see and we are aware of the trend in the industry” of regular economy class flyers seeking out airlines that offer premium economy, said Bertrand. “More and more airlines are moving to [offer premium economy].”

Meanwhile, Air France is embracing the flexibility afforded it by adding the 787 to its fleet. When the carrier first ordered the twinjets, it faced “many questions at the time” as to “why did you order both aircraft”, the A330 and 787 since, it was argued that “they are so close”.

“No, no they are not so close,” insisted Bertrand.

“The 787 families are smaller; the A330 family is really bigger”, which in the future “will provide us more flexibility to decide what is the right need for the fleet … how the fleet will grow. We have flexibility.”

An innovative process for composite repairs on jetliners such as Airbus’ A350 XWB has been developed by an Airbus working group from company locations in Spain, Germany, the UK and France – with the procedure validated on an A350-900 flight test aircraft.“Most composite parts used to be removable so they could be repaired in a standard shop,” explained Guillaume Ferrer, embodiment engineering manager, composite repair process development. “This is impossible for the wings and fuselage so new repair techniques were required.”An R&T working group was formed to explore new repair ideas. The standard process uses an autoclave. “We kept 90% of the process except for the autoclave, which is why these are called out-of-autoclave repairs,” said Ferrer.While the repair process’ bonded technique is not new, the tools and level of automation are.The working group developed a portable robotic repair jet that uses water mixed with an abrasive to remove up to 500 sq. cm. of damaged material for replacement with new carbon fibre. The replacement composite material is cured on site – at an airport or maintenance centre, for example – eliminating the need for the large autoclave traditionally employed in the manufacture of composites.“The repair jet is a new, Airbus-qualified tool,” explained Sebastien Hanser, the major repairs technical project manager. “The machine’s advantages include its ability to repeat tasks and contain carbon dust. It is suited to difficult locations on the aircraft, such as where an operator would be working upside down, and it has a development potential.”Also new is an inflatable clean room, which brings the environmental specifications used in manufacturing plants close to the aircraft. “Temperature, dust levels and humidity can be managed, allowing us to perform the work that requires clean and dry conditions,” Sebastien added.During the A350 XWB’s certification, the team used the full-scale test specimen and fatigue tests to qualify their processes and reach Technology Readiness Level 6 (TRL 6). At the end of last year, the team performed a repair on MSN003 in Toulouse to test out the techniques in real conditions.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999536275863647}",neutral,0.9999536275863647,0

The Children’s Colorado and FFLC-branded helicopter is the first of its kind and will serve patients around the Rocky Mountain region. The helicopter has been configured to meet the needs of the tiniest patients, featuring more interior space, and providing an improved platform for the isolette and other equipment essential to newborn and pediatric transport.

With the addition of the sixth helicopter for FFLC comes increased staffing to meet the growing demand for specialized transport in the region. Children’s Colorado’s FFLC program will now have two specialty teams available 24/7, including specially-trained nurses and respiratory therapists, supported by emergency medical technicians (EMTs), pilots and communication specialists. Studies have found that the use of pediatric specialty care teams during transport improves outcomes for pediatric patients.

“The helicopter is an incredible tool that, combined with our world-class team of neonatal and pediatric experts who are the soul of our program, will help assure care to our most vulnerable patients as quickly as possible,” said Joe Darmofal, director of flight team, EMS, outreach and education at Children’s Colorado. “The helicopter and expanded staffing also illustrate the benefits of our strong and historic partnership with Centura and FFLC.”

Facts about the helicopter:

• The Airbus H130 will be based in the Denver-metro area. It will be supplied by AirMethods Corp, provider of FFLC’s current helicopter fleet, along with pilots, mechanics and supporting services;

• The helicopter will provide transportation to pediatric patients within a 120-mile service area, including Colorado, southwestern Nebraska and southern Wyoming;

• Children’s Colorado and FFLC have partnered since 1997 to optimize neonatal and pediatric transport services in the Rocky Mountain region.

“Children’s Hospital Colorado has relied on Flight For Life Colorado for 20 years, for its critical care transport needs,” said FFLC director Kathy Mayer. “This expansion, to add a dedicated helicopter, is part of our 45-year long commitment to the communities we serve and to the patients who need us, across a nine-state region. We’re happy to be working with Children’s Colorado on this latest expansion of our service.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9356722831726074}",positive,0.9356722831726074,1

In total, ten Airbus A319 and A320 aircraft will be reconfigured with the award-winning product as part of a business adjustment to strengthen the airline’s European network.

The slimmer seats are lightweight and designed to take less space, enabling Air Serbia to install additional rows of seats, while improving the overall living space and comfort for guests.

With the cabin refurbishment, seat capacity on the A319 aircraft will increase from 128 to 144 seats and on the A320s from 155 to 174 seats, growing by more than 12 per cent in total across the narrow-body fleet.

The new seats will be installed in both the Business and Economy classes and the first A319 aircraft, registered YU-APJ, is currently being retrofitted.

Dane Kondi?, Chief Executive Officer of Air Serbia, said: “The Recaro seats are space-efficient, much lighter and provide more legroom for guests thanks to their modern design.

“The new seats are roughly 2.6kg lighter than our older-generation seats, which will cut down the empty weight of our Airbus A320 and A319 fleet by more than 3,500kg, reducing fuel consumption and carbon emissions. “The increase in seat capacity is equivalent to Air Serbia adding an extra Airbus jet to its fleet and will at the same time improve the inflight product and comfort levels. “This will make Air Serbia more competitive, substantially reduce unit costs, drive revenue growth and bring our seat density up, meaning we can better meet travel demand during the summer. “Many of the biggest airlines in Europe, America and Asia have installed the Recaro seat, which is a testament to its winning combination of comfortable design and functionality.”

Air Serbia will be installing 1,500 Recaro seats in total over the next coming weeks.

Despite the capacity increase, the seats offer guests more living space by having a leaner backrest and a higher literature pocket. Normally placed in the knee area, the pocket has been placed above the tray table, ensuring more legroom.

The new Recaro seats will also be installed in Business Class on the narrow-body fleet, which will seat two guests in each aisle compared to three in Economy, with the middle seat kept empty for extra space.

The Business Class will be separated from Economy Class by a movable class divider, enabling Air Serbia to adapt the number of seats according to travel demand. Up to 12 seats will now be available in Business Class depending on the seating configuration.

Guests travelling in business class on the Airbus A319 and A320 fleet will continue to enjoy the same excellent level of service, including a Dine Anytime menu with a selection of à la carte meals and an iPad loaded with films, TV shows and music.

Travellers in both classes will also be able to access the internet through the inflight Wi-Fly service and stream entertainment to their smartphones and tablets for free through Elevate Play, which is available for Android and Apple devices.

Along with the new seats, the A319 and A320 cabin change includes new carpets, curtains and floor path markings to match the onboard décor on the airline’s Airbus A330 which currently serves New York.

The airline will continue to offer its flagship long-haul product on transatlantic flights to the US, which offer 18 lie-flat seats in business and 236 seats in economy class.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9990900754928589}",positive,0.9990900754928589,1
News Analysis: China's new passenger planes no threat to Boeing: U.S. experts - Xinhua | English.news.cn - Xinhua,"Fri, 05 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHA6Ly93d3cueGluaHVhbmV0LmNvbS9lbmdsaXNoLzIwMTctMDUvMDUvY18xMzYyNTc5MjEuaHRt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Source: Xinhua| 2017-05-05 07:03:00|Editor: Xiang Bo

Staff workers check a C919, China's first domestically-built large passenger jet, at a hangar of the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) in Shanghai, east China, May 4, 2017. The maiden flight of the C919 is scheduled for May 5. The flight will depart from Shanghai Pudong International Airport. ""If weather conditions are not suitable, the maiden flight will be rescheduled,"" COMAC said. (Xinhua/Ding Ting)

WASHINGTON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. experts said Thursday China's new passenger planes pose no immediate threat to Western aviation companies such as Boeing and Airbus.

The maiden flight of China's C919 passenger plane, scheduled for Friday from Shanghai Pudong International Airport, represents one step towards the country's bid to reduce reliance on foreign airliners.

""The Chinese government is interested in establishing independence and self-sufficiency in all aspects of aviation,"" Douglas Royce, an aerospace expert at Forecast International, an aerospace market research firm, told Xinhua.

It is engaged in a long-term process of catching up to Europe, the United States, and Russia in commercial aircraft, he said, adding this is one step in that direction.

The 158-seat C919 is China's first large passenger jet and is expected to compete with the updated Airbus 320 and Boeing's new generation 737.

So far, 23 foreign and domestic customers, including China's national carrier Air China and leasing company GE Capital Aviation Service, have placed orders for 570 aircrafts, according to the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), the manufacturer of the C919.

Royce predicted that demand for the C919 will be centered in the Chinese market and a few satellite markets in the early years of service.

""Airbus and Boeing have spent decades competing fiercely against each other and are lean and mean in the airliner market. The duopoly in the airliner sector has resulted in very well-made products,"" he explained.

""What COMAC faces here is not two bloated, non-competitive players. Both companies are at the top of their game,"" Royce said. ""So it will be very difficult for COMAC to break into western markets, particularly when very few airlines have experience with using COMAC's aircraft in service.""

In contrast, the A320 and 737 have huge advantages because the airlines already have built up a lot of knowledge and infrastructure around flying both types.

Richard Aboulafia, vice president at Teal Group Corp., a U.S.-based aeronautics analysis firm, held a similar view.

While building and flying a plane is an important step and an expensive one, the next steps such as customer support, finance, and the ability to offer aggressive discounts are ""just as important, and just as expensive,"" he told Xinhua.

Even if the C919 ends up being a superior aircraft, it will still take years for many Western airlines to consider adding the type to their fleets, Royce noted.

But he added that the C919 might be able to get orders from startup airlines that aren't already flying either of the Western models. In addition, traditional customers of Russian passenger aircraft will also make viable sales targets.

To pave the way for the jet to enter foreign market, China has already been in talks with the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to obtain the airworthiness certification for the C919.

""Getting FAA and EASA certification would be a huge win for the program,"" Royce said. ""The aircraft requires Western certification to compete directly with Airbus and Boeing in major markets. On a symbolic level, it also shows huge progress for China's civil aircraft industry.""

However, he cautioned that certification is ""a long and expensive process"" for aircraft manufacturers in the U.S. and that for a newcomer like COMAC, dealing with the FAA is ""a new world for them.""

Aboulafia said while certification is necessary, it ""has no impact on commercial competitiveness.""

Meanwhile, COMAC estimated that it can sell 2,000 C919s over the next 20 years, but Royce said it's ""way too optimistic.""

""An estimate of 600-800 C919s over 20 years once production starts is a more reasonable goal given the very strong competition offered by Boeing and Airbus, coupled with Chinese-made airliners' lack of a long-term operating and maintenance history,"" he said.

""A COMAC-built airliner has no track record in either area, and it will take a long time for the aircraft manufacturer to establish itself as the equal of Airbus and Boeing in the area of global sales and product support.""

However, over the very long term, Royce said, COMAC is likely to become ""a major player in the airline segment.""

""It's not something that will happen over the next decade, but rather a long-term process that will require ongoing support from the Chinese government,"" he said.

When asked to comment on the C919, a spokesman for Boeing told Xinhua: ""We would like to take this opportunity to congratulate COMAC for the successful development of the C919 airplane.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999946117401123}",neutral,0.999946117401123,0
Will American Airlines Ever Buy the Airbus A350? - The Motley Fool,"Sat, 06 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDE3LzA1LzA2L3dpbGwtYW1lcmljYW4tYWlybGluZXMtZXZlci1idXktdGhlLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLmFzcHjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"American Airlines just deferred its order for 22 Airbus A350s for the second time in less than a year. Is there still a place in its fleet for the A350?

American Airlines (AAL 0.36%) is one of Airbus' (EADSY -3.02%) top customers. However, its commitment to one of Airbus' key models seems to be wavering.

Less than a year ago, American Airlines deferred its order for 22 A350 widebodies. The largest U.S. airline had originally planned to take delivery of 14 A350s in the 2017-2018 period. This deferral pushed back its first two deliveries to late 2018, with the rest scheduled to arrive between 2019 and 2022.

Late last month, American Airlines announced that it had deferred its entire A350 order by another two years. While the company still claims that it will eventually add the A350 to its fleet, it's not clear that it will ever make sense for American to go through with the order.

Reducing capital expenditures

For the past few years, American Airlines has spent heavily to modernize its fleet. But in the past year or so, as its profitability has come under pressure, the company has started to focus more on keeping capex in check. (American has also needed to reduce its international growth in light of challenging market conditions.)

Holding down capex will be particularly important in the next few years, as American Airlines has scheduled debt maturities totaling $12 billion between 2018 and 2021.

According to American Airlines CFO Derek Kerr, last year's A350 deferral reduced the company's capex by roughly $500 million in 2017 and $700 million in 2018. The more recent deferral will save another $500 million in 2018 and $300 million each in 2019 and 2020.

Does American Airlines need more widebodies?

Even after the most recent deferral, it's not clear that American Airlines will need the A350s when they are scheduled to arrive. Thanks to its recent fleet modernization program, the carrier doesn't have many planes left that need to be retired in the near term.

The Airbus A350 could be a good replacement for American's fleet of 47 Boeing (BA -1.90%) 777-200ERs. However, those planes are just 16 years old, on average. Furthermore, the Boeing 777 is an exceptionally reliable model, and American is in the midst of refurbishing this fleet to add seats to each plane (and thus reduce unit costs). All in all, these planes probably still have a decade of life left.

Alternatively, American Airlines may plan to use its A350s for growth rather than replacement. But future long-haul growth is contingent on a better supply-demand balance in international markets. If international routes remain flooded with excess capacity a couple of years from now, American might just kick the can further down the road by deferring the A350s again.

The A350-900 has a lot of overlap with Boeing's widebodies

Another issue that American Airlines must consider is the overlap between the A350 and its Boeing 777 and Boeing 787 fleets. While American has deferred its A350 deliveries twice in the past year, it has kept its order for Boeing's 787 Dreamliner more or less intact. By early 2019, it will have 42 Dreamliners in its fleet.

Given that American Airlines operates lots of 777s and 787s, it doesn't necessarily need to fly the A350 as well. The 777s and 787s are suited to the same types of long-haul markets as the A350.

By contrast, most of American's international flights are about 3,500-4,500 miles in length, such as flights from Miami to South America or from the Northeast to Europe. American Airlines might be better off converting its A350 order to the cheaper A330neo, which has plenty of range and competitive unit costs for routes of this length. This would further reduce its future capex commitments.

Airbus can afford the loss

It wouldn't necessarily be bad for Airbus if American Airlines chooses to convert its A350 order to the A330neo. The A350 has a long backlog, with more than 700 unfilled orders. And while Airbus only received three A350 orders during the first quarter, it recently bagged an order for 20 A350-900s from China Southern Airlines, indicating that demand remains healthy.

By contrast, Airbus has just over 200 A330neo orders, and many of those are scheduled for far in the future. In short, Airbus has much more of a need to sell A330neos than A350s. As a result, both sides could benefit from making a deal to swap American's endlessly deferred A350 orders for A330neos.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9985827207565308}",neutral,0.9985827207565308,0
Watch A Porsche Tow A 285-Ton Airbus A380 - CarScoops,"Mon, 01 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnNjb29wcy5jb20vMjAxNy8wNS93YXRjaC1wb3JzY2hlLXRvdy0yODUtdG9uLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A Porsche may not be the first vehicle that’d come to mind if you have a load to haul. Maybe tow one on a trailer to and from the race track, sure, but to do the towing itself?



Well Porsche is out to fix that conception with this latest publicity stunt. Teaming up with Air France, the German automaker brought its latest Cayenne crossover to Charles de Gaulle airport outside Paris and towed an Airbus A380 – setting a new world record in the process.

The A380, for those unfamiliar, is one of the largest aircraft ever made. Airbus’ double-decker jumbo jet weighs 285 metric tons, eclipsing the Boeing 747 and coming second only to the truly massive Antonov An-225 Mriya cargo jet on the list of the world’s largest production civilian aircraft. Despite its gargantuan size and weight, though, the Cayenne proved capable of towing it for a distance of 42 meters (138 feet).

Now if you’re wondering if Porsche achieved the feat in a gasoline or diesel Cayenne, the answer is “yes.” The achievement was first carried out in a Cayenne S Diesel, whose 4.1-liter V8 produces 380 horsepower and a mammoth 630 lb-ft of torque. And just to show they could, the team then repeated the exercise in a Cayenne Turbo S, whose 4.8-liter V8 churns out much more power at 560 hp but a bit less torque at 590 lb-ft. Impressive, either way you look at it.

The vehicles were entirely showroom stock. All they required was a special attachment for the standard towing bar. And to show that they were undamaged in the endeavor (not to mention return them to their place of origin), the vehicles were then driven back to London from whence they had driven in the first place.

If all of this seems strikingly familiar, you may recall a similar feat orchestrated by sister brand Volkswagen. Over a decade ago VW hooked up its Touareg (with over 15,000 pounds of added ballast) to a 747, putting the 309 hp and 553 lb-ft of torque from its 5.0-liter V10 TDI to good use in moving the 155-ton jumbo jet for a distance of 150 meters (nearly 500 feet).

The Toyota Tundra had little trouble towing the Space Shuttle Endeavour a couple of years ago, either. Something tells us this won’t be the last one of these towing stunts we’ll be seeing.

* The landing gear system includes:

Strut

Shock absorber

Extraction/retraction mechanism

Brakes

Wheel

Tyre

The main functions of the landing gear are as follows:

Energy absorpton at landing Braking Taxi control

About the shock absorber, its main role is to zero the vertical component of the airplane velocity during landing, with no rebound and limited load transfer to the vehicle structure. Its secondary requirement is to allow a comfortable taxiing. Different types of shock absorbers are available, but when costs and dimensions allow, a hydraulic system is commonly used.

Substantially the system structure is made of a moveable piston that, when loaded, compresses a gas (nitrogen) in a cylinder and causes an oil flow through orifices. The system elasticity is due to the gas transformation while the damping effect is due to the liquid pressure losses (through the orifices).

The plane's maiden flight will take off from Shanghai Pudong International Airport. (Photo/Xinhua)

While the much-awaited first Chinese-built passenger jet C919 is ready to make its maiden flight Friday, it may take much longer for the newcomer to take off in the aviation market.

Shaking the dominance of aviation giants Boeing and Airbus in the near future is unrealistic, observers say, but the Chinese jetliner could be a strong option for global carriers in decades to come.

Scheduled to depart from Shanghai Pudong International Airport on May 5, the C919, with 158 seats and a standard range of 4,075 kilometers, is expected to compete with the updated Airbus 320 and Boeing's new generation 737.

A total of 23 foreign and domestic customers, including China's national carrier Air China and leasing company GE Capital Aviation Service, have placed orders for 570 aircraft, according to the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC).

But this is only the very first step. Even in China's domestic market, COMAC has a long way to go to turn technical success into business success.

Currently, Chinese airlines seem to be more keen to spend money on wide-body aircraft to enhance their global routes with rising enthusiasm for overseas travel. Those jets are still the exclusive province of Boeing and Airbus.

China Eastern Airlines signed contracts in 2016 to buy 20 A350-900 aircraft from Airbus and 15 B787-9 aircraft from Boeing to be delivered between 2018 and 2022.

China Southern Airlines announced in April that it will buy 20 A350-900 with a total catalog price of nearly 6 billion U.S. dollars.

Boeing and Airbus are very mature aircraft manufacturers, and COMAC should seek further cooperation with them to learn from their experiences, according to aviation analysts.

But looking ahead, single-aisle planes like C919 will be the market mainstream and COMAC should do well in the Chinese market, one of the most competitive.

Boeing predicted last year that China will become the world's top aviation market within 20 years, projecting a demand for 6,810 new aircraft in the next two decades with a total value of 1 trillion U.S. dollars.

China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035, accounting for 75 percent of the total new deliveries, according to Boeing.

The C919 will be a strong competitor in this field being economical and comfortable, according to a research note from Guosen Securities.

If the maiden flight is successful, COMAC will seek airworthiness certificates from the Civil Aviation Administration of China and foreign aviation safety regulators before making its first deliveries.

Also, to pave way for C919 to enter foreign markets, the airworthiness certification of the jet will be a part of bilateral air safety agreement talks between China and the EU.

China has invested heavily in commercial passenger jet manufacturing. In 2007, plans to develop a domestic large passenger jet were approved by the State Council. In November 2015, the first C919 jet rolled off the assembly line.

The ARJ21, the country's first regional aircraft also produced by COMAC, began commercial operations in June 2016 following its maiden flight in 2008.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9775004982948303}",positive,0.9775004982948303,1

Delta Air Lines Airbus A330-200 (N861NW): Three Incidents in One Week - AirlineGeeks.com,"Mon, 29 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZWdlZWtzLmNvbS8yMDE3LzA1LzI5L2RlbHRhLWFpci1saW5lcy1haXJidXMtYTMzMC0yMDAtbjg2MW53LXRocmVlLWluY2lkZW50cy1pbi1vbmUtd2Vlay_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"[ Planes ] By Daniel Morley

On May 20, Delta Air Lines flight 135 was in cruise, near the end of its long-haul flight to Detroit from Amsterdam. While preparing for the upcoming approach into Detroit, the flight crew noticed vibrations in the right-hand engine of the Airbus A330. As a precaution, the flight crew decided to divert to Toronto.

Thirty-five minutes after first noticing the issue with the engine, the aircraft made a safe landing in Toronto. No passengers or crew were injured and the aircraft remained on the ground in Toronto for 32 hours before repositioning to Detroit, where it sat for another 16 hours before re-entering service.

On May 24, four days after the incident over Toronto, the same Airbus A330 was descending into Amsterdam on a flight from Detroit, operating as Delta Air Lines flight 136. As the flight passed through 38,000 feet the right engine stalled and the crew received numerous error messages from the wing anti-ice system.

The engine stalled two more times before the flight crew placed it in idle and it returned to normal limits. The airport was prepared for an emergency landing in case the aircraft wouldn’t be able to exit the runway upon touch down. Again, thirty-five minutes after the issue with the right engine began the aircraft made a safe touchdown at Amsterdam airport with no injuries to the crew or passengers.

The aircraft remained on the ground in the Netherlands for 29 hours before re-entering service.

On Friday, Delta flight 135 was in-flight west of Ireland enroute back to Detroit from Amsterdam. The flight crew received warning of issues with the oil pressure in the number two engine. The flight crew requested an emergency descent to 19,000 feet and to divert to Shannon.

The crew didn’t shut down the engine and made a safe arrival in Shannon without the need for emergency services and all passengers were accommodated.

All three of these incidents happened within a week, with the last two incidents occurring within forty-eight hours of each other. More importantly, all three of these incidents occurred on the same aircraft, an Airbus A330-200, registration N861NW.

The aircraft is only 11 years old and was delivered new to Northwest Airlines, and acquired by Delta as part of the merger in 2009. Although after each incident the aircraft was down for considerable amounts of time, the aircraft experienced similar issues with the same engine.

Although diversions and incidents involving engine issues are common across the world, to have three issues with the same engine on the same aircraft is extremely rare. Although Delta is one of the safest airlines in the world, with the last fatality occurring in 1996, 21 years ago, these incidents show that not everyone is immune to incidents.

With safety always the top priority in aviation, these incidents highlight the need to constantly monitor the safety of each airline. This applies to even those with a strong history of safety. Although these incidents ended with a safe landing of each flight, next time may not be so fortunate. That is why in this industry, airlines should be constantly improving in maintenance and safety so to prevent incidents from occurring in the future.

‘Made in China’ C919 passenger jet takes maiden flight - Al Jazeera English,"Fri, 05 May 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDE3LzUvNS9tYWRlLWluLWNoaW5hLWM5MTktcGFzc2VuZ2VyLWpldC10YWtlcy1tYWlkZW4tZmxpZ2h00gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWxqYXplZXJhLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy8yMDE3LzUvNS9tYWRlLWluLWNoaW5hLWM5MTktcGFzc2VuZ2VyLWpldC10YWtlcy1tYWlkZW4tZmxpZ2h0?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Single-aisle plane can carry up to 168 passengers and is meant to rival Airbus and Boeing aircraft.

The first large Chinese-made passenger jet has taken off on its maiden flight, a key milestone for a country seeking a place in the global aviation market.

The C919 single-aisle jet, which can hold up to 168 passengers, soared over Pudong international airport in the commercial hub Shanghai as a crowd of thousands cheered.

China is one of the biggest aviation markets, but relies on foreign-made aircraft and has long sought to enter the lucrative global jet market, which is estimated to be worth $2 trillion over the next 20 years.

The maiden test flight had been pushed back at least twice since 2014 due to production issues. Friday’s flight included a skeleton crew of five people and carried no passengers.

Aviation analyst Tom Ballantyne told Al Jazeera that Friday’s flight represented a “huge moment” for China.

“It is important for the Chinese government to show that its industrial processes are on par with the West or are heading in that direction,” he said.

C919 must ‘prove itself’

While the 39-metre long plane is made in China, foreign firms are playing key roles by supplying systems as well as engines.

The Chinese plane is touted to rival to the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737, but a spokesman for the aircraft’s maker said it cannot compare.

“You can’t compare us to Boeing or Airbus, they’re in a different strategic stage … We took half a century to solve the first strategic issue [of plane development], it will also take many years to solve the second [market] problem,” Jeff Cheng, a spokesman for the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), told Reuters news agency prior to the maiden flight.

Ballantyne said it will be years before the C919 will be able to fully compete with Western-made planes.

“This Chinese aircraft will have to prove itself in operation before any Western airline will even consider purchasing it,” he said.

Ballantyne added that “it is very unlikely that it will be able to compete in terms of technology and economics with the new-generation aircraft” produced by of Boeing and Airbus.

Hundreds of orders

If Friday’s maiden flight is successful, COMAC, the aircraft’s maker, will seek certification from China’s civil aviation authority and foreign regulators.

COMAC has already received 570 orders and commitments from 23 customers, mainly Chinese-owned carriers and leasing companies.

The safety certification of the new plane – which state media says will have a catalog price tag of around $50 million, less than half that of a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320 – could be among the biggest issues for the C919 internationally.

Questions remain regarding the safety approvals needed for the C919 to secure a foothold outside of China.

Chinese airlines are expected drive demand over the next two decades, buying nearly 7,000 planes – mostly from Boeing and Airbus.

China has dreamed of building its own civil aircraft since the 1970s when Jiang Qing, leader Mao Zedong’s wife and a member of the notorious “Gang of Four”, personally backed an attempt to do so. But the Y-10’s heavy weight made it impractical and only three were ever made.

China’s first domestically-made regional jet, the twin-engine regional ARJ21, flew its passengers in June 2016, eight years after its first test flight.

The development of the C919 a key step on the path laid out by Chinese leaders to transform the country into a creator of profitable technology.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998156428337097}",neutral,0.9998156428337097,0
