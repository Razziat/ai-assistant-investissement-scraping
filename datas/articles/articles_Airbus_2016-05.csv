Airbus launches ACJ350 XWB with Easyfit outfitting - Airbus,"Mon, 23 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNi0wNS1haXJidXMtbGF1bmNoZXMtYWNqMzUwLXh3Yi13aXRoLWVhc3lmaXQtb3V0Zml0dGluZ9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Summary

World’s most modern VIP widebody

Airbus is launching a new corporate-jet version of its popular A350 XWB airliner, with Easyfit provisions for cabin-outfitting, expanding its corporate jet family with an aircraft that delivers more capacity, capability and comfort.Called the ACJ350 XWB, it features 270 m2/2,910 ft2 of cabin space in the -900 version. The ultra-long range variant can fly 25 passengers up to 10,800 nm/20,000 km or 22 hours, making it today’s most modern and capable corporate jet.The XWB stands for Xtra Widebody, enabling the ACJ350 to deliver Xtra comfort, Xtra innovative technology, Xtra efficiency, and to be Xtra easy to outfit.Widebodies such as the ACJ350 offer the equivalent of several houses of floorspace, so creating cabins that meet demanding certification rules can be challenging, especially when they are installed within a fuselage made of new materials such as carbonfibre.Airbus has thus chosen to pre-equip the carbonfibre fuselage of the ACJ350 with hundreds of attachment points, greatly simplifying the work of cabin-outfitters. It has also worked extensively with several cabin outfitters to ensure smooth completions for customers.“One of Airbus’s greatest strengths is to offer customers the world’s most modern and efficient aircraft family, and the ACJ350 with Easyfit expands its corporate jet offering, giving customers a new way to take their business to the world,” says Airbus Chief Operating Officer, Customers John Leahy. “Our customers want the best and most modern aircraft that money can buy, and the ACJ350 exemplifies that,” he adds.Airline deliveries of the Airbus A350-900 began in December 2014. Together with the A350-1000 version, currently in development and due to enter airline service in 2017, the family has already won some 800 orders from more than 40 customers.Like all Airbus aircraft, the ACJ350 personifies features that many aircraft lack or which cost extra, such as the enhanced protection of fly-by-wire controls, time and cost-saving centralised maintenance, and extensive use of weight and maintenance-saving materials.In addition, the ACJ350 XWB deliveres, as standard, new features such as an onboard airport navigation system (OANS), like GPS in a car, and a runway overrun prevention system (ROPS), an aid for pilots that helps to prevent runway excursions, especially in challenging weather.More than 180 Airbus corporate jets are in service around the world, and they are flying on every continent, including Antarctica, highlighting their widespread nature and versatility."
Turbine Pilot: Boeing 737NG versus Airbus A320 - AOPA,"Thu, 05 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFvcGEub3JnL25ld3MtYW5kLW1lZGlhL2FsbC1uZXdzLzIwMTYvbWF5L3BpbG90L3RfYnZh0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Turbine Pilot: Boeing 737NG versus Airbus A320 We take a look at the two most popular narrowbodies

Like high-wing versus low-wing or twins versus singles, the Boeing versus Airbus debate is among the most contentious arguments in modern aviation. Most of us have likely ridden on either the Boeing 737NG (-700, -800, -900) or Airbus A319/320/321 series in our commercial travels. Some airline pilot readers may also have flown one or both of the types. If not, bear with us here as we scuttle smaller-airplane talk and reignite the Boeing/Airbus debate from a pilot’s standpoint.

A few years back I transitioned from the 737NG (Next Generation) to the Airbus A319/320 series at my airline. The transition from Boeing to Airbus was a big step. The operating philosophy of the two airplanes is about as large a chasm as any I can think of when it comes to airplane design.

Boeing’s 737, which first appeared in 1967, is very much an old-school machine featuring a traditional floor-mounted yoke connected to control cables connected directly to hydraulically boosted control surfaces. The Airbus appeared in 1988 and took advantage of fly-by-wire (FBW) control, which uses a sidestick connected to, well, not much. It’s connected to a computer that senses the pilot’s input and delivers electrical signals to hydraulically actuated controls. To the purist, the Airbus design may seem a little scary. After all, if you lose all hydraulics, there is no manual reversion. In practice, though, FBW works quite well—although the design certainly went through a lot of developmental hiccups.

And the Airbus has automation galore. Airbus pilots are wont to say, “it’s automatique” (in a French accent) to describe what the airplane does behind the scenes to reduce pilot workload. While the 737 has switches everywhere to control generators, air conditioning, hydraulics, et cetera, the Airbus does most of the work by itself in normal operation.

In fairness, Boeing also could employ the same level of automation, but in order to keep a common type rating between the Classic (-100 through -500) and NG models (-600 through -900), the company preserved much of the same switchology and system panel layouts. The 737NG was born in direct response to the Airbus A319/320’s introduction. Boeing went back to the drawing board and completely redesigned the venerable 737 for its reintroduction as the NG in 1997. An all-new wing featuring better aerodynamics and more fuel capacity allowed the airplane to fly higher, faster, and farther, and carry more. Instead of it being a stretch to fly from New York to Denver, the 737NG could now fly transcontinental trips with fuel to spare while carrying a full load at faster speeds.

As far as pilot comfort goes, the Airbus is a leap ahead of the Boeing. The 737’s forward fuselage is the same as that of the 707, which was designed in the mid-1950s. It begins tapering to the nose in the first-class cabin, and by the time you get to the cockpit it’s a pretty small tube. The Airbus keeps its beamy width all the way to the cockpit, providing a commodious workplace for the pilots.

Airbus took its time designing the cockpit, resulting in a clean, logical layout that is well marked and void of any lights during normal operations. Everything is covered in plastic, so pilots don’t see the construction details underneath. There are ample air vents to keep you cool in the summer and (optional) foot warmers to keep your toes warm in the winter. There’s plenty of room for all your baggage, two jumpseaters, and all the duty-free purchases you can bring on. There’s no massive yoke, either, so you can cross your legs if you want. There’s also a clever table that extends from the panel on which to lay your charts/iPad or crew meal. No eating off your lap like in the 737. Finally, the Airbus cockpit is noticeably quieter than the 737.

NG models of the 737 have better-appointed cockpits than the Classics they replaced, but there’s still plenty of evidence that it’s mostly a cover-up job to compete with the Airbus. It, too, blows warm and cold air where and when you want it. But the old design shines through in other areas. You still see drain tubes in the corners of the windshields, for example.

Since there’s very little room in the 737 cockpit, your roll-aboard bags stow under one of the jumpseats. The jumpseats themselves are a step above dungeon comfort with thin cushions and a straight-up posture. The ride in the second (optional) jumpseat mounted behind the captain can best be described as being strapped to a wall, complete with dangling feet if you’re short. And your jumpseaters can’t bring on anything larger than a knapsack because there’s simply no room.

But that’s enough talk about accommodations. How do they fly? Both the Airbus and Boeings are great airplanes to fly. With its traditional controls, the 737 at slow speeds requires much larger inputs to make things happen, just as it would in any conventional airplane. At higher speeds, just your fingertips will do the job. And like all GA airplanes I’ve flown, the 737 uses trim control. The Airbus’ FBW system always trims to one G. The only “trimming” an Airbus pilot does is on the ground—to set the stabilizer in the takeoff position for a given center of gravity. After that, it’s automatique!

The FBW of the Airbus’ side-stick does a good job of keeping the inputs the same throughout the entire speed envelope. I’ve enjoyed the sidestick control immensely. It makes hand-flying the Airbus a pleasure—most of the time.

Type “Airbus A320 crosswind landings” into the search window of YouTube, make some popcorn, and enjoy the show. The FBW logic of the Airbus can create some really interesting gyrations for its occupants in strong, gusty crosswinds. There are many techniques to tame the beast, but most aren’t like the completely conventional handling of the Boeing—which has rudder and aileron power to spare and is very conventional and predictable.

Speaking of landings, the Airbus is much easier to land smoothly and, for pilots, it goes a long way to stroke our already-inflated egos. If you can consistently grease a 737NG landing, you’re a better pilot than most. The problem with that airplane, especially the long-bodied models, is that it lands so fast. Because tail strikes are a big threat for the long, low-slung airplanes, approach speeds are in the 150- to 160-knot range, which is about 40 knots or more above stall speed. All that extra speed keeps the long-bodied 737s flat to avoid tail strikes, but it also causes them to skip right back in the air at initial touchdown—just a few inches. It’s just long enough for the ground-spoiler system to sense wheel spin, at which point the spoilers deploy—right now! And it’s that second plop to the ground that makes the NGs one of the more difficult airplanes to consistently land well.

This also brings up a safety issue. There have been more than a few runway overruns in long-bodied 737s. They are heavy, they land fast, and they have only four main-wheel brakes—unlike a 757, which has eight brakes. Pilots who like to use all of the runway’s touchdown zone trying to squeak out a good landing are playing with fire in this airplane, especially on wet or contaminated runways. Remember, style points don’t count if you run off the end of the runway.

Airbus has its safety quirks, too. The sidesticks move independently from each other, which makes it difficult to know what the other pilot is doing with his or her control. This design was cited as a causal factor in the 2009 crash of Air France 447, an Airbus A330 that crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, and AirAsia 8501, an A320 that crashed in the Java Sea in December 2014. In both cases, the first officer was holding his stick in the nearly full aft position for most of the airplane’s fall down to the sea. It would be difficult for the other pilot to notice, since his stick would remain in the neutral position. With the Boeing’s monster yoke residing between your legs, there’s no question what the other pilot’s doing.

Another threat to situational awareness is the fact that the Airbus’ thrust levers don’t move during autothrottle operation. While the Boeing autothrottles move as if being manipulated by an invisible hand, the Airbus levers stay in the Climb detent for auto operation. It takes a little getting used to when engines are at idle and the levers are forward.

To finish describing the differences between the 737 and Airbus could fill a textbook or two. But it’s obvious from their popularity with airlines that both are excellent choices. Each has its weaknesses, but both do an excellent job of moving people and cargo safely, efficiently, and reliably.

Pilot comfort

Airbus: Roomy forward fuselage makes a quiet, well-organized workspace.

Boeing: NG models are upgrades, but older design shines through.

Handling

Airbus: Fly-by-wire inputs remain the same throughout the speed envelope.

Boeing: Traditional controls require larger inputs at slower speeds.

Landings

Airbus: Easier to land smoothly, but fly-by-wire logic makes crosswind landings a challenge.

Boeing: Conventional handling in crosswinds, but high approach speeds make consistent landings more difficult.

Safety

Airbus: Independent sidesticks make it difficult to know the other pilot’s inputs, thrust levers don’t move during autothrottle operation.

Boeing: Pilots who make long landings risk overruns."
Airbus and Safran Agree to Space Launcher Joint Venture - Defense News,"Tue, 10 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9zcGFjZS8yMDE2LzA1LzEwL2FpcmJ1cy1hbmQtc2FmcmFuLWFncmVlLXRvLXNwYWNlLWxhdW5jaGVyLWpvaW50LXZlbnR1cmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Airbus group and Safran have signed an agreement to put strategic missile launchers into their 50/50 space launchers joint venture, the two companies said in a joint statement.



""Both companies will contribute to the current joint program with industrial assets dealing with civil space launchers and military launchers,"" the companies said.



Airbus Defence & Space is prime contractor for the M51 new generation strategic submarine-launched ballistic missile, and was notified in 2014 of a contract for the M51.3 upgrade. The French Navy is upgrading its four Triomphant class nuclear missile submarines with the M51, which entered service in 2010.



Signing the agreement is the second and final stage of the Airbus Safran Launchers joint venture, the companies said.





The 50-50 ownership reflected a rare case of ""strategic shareholdings"" in a ""strategic structure,"" Marwan Lahoud, Airbus chief strategy and marketing officer and chairman of Gifas, the French aerospace trade body, told journalists May 3. Only European missile maker MBDA has a similar ownership structure.

Safran has agreed to pay €800 million (US $920 million) to Airbus to acquire an equal holding in the space launcher joint venture, an industry executive said. The value of Airbus’ space business, including upgrading M51, would have given the aerospace group a 70 percent stake, leaving Safran with 30 percent.

That imbalance led to Safran agreeing to pay the €800 million to bring in the 20 percent to allow an equal ownership of the joint venture. Safran brings its Herakles subsidiary, a solid rocket motor specialist, into the deal.

Payment of €800 million for a 20 percent stake implies a valuation of €4 billion for the planned joint venture.

The new company is expected to play a key role in building the planned Ariane 6 rocket, seen as key to replying to competition from the Space X, a US privately owned launcher, Reuters reported.

A first phase led to Airbus and Safran putting their civil space and launcher contracts into a joint program company.

""In this second and final phase, industrial assets and military launchers will be integrated in the joint venture,"" the companies said. ""Airbus Safran Launchers will be a fully fledged operational company.""

The joint venture agreement is expected to close by the end of June, the companies said.

France is studying a successor to the Triomphant boat, which will carry ballistic nuclear missiles based on the M51 but not a new generation weapon, according to ""The President and the Bomb"" (Odile Jacob), a book co-authored by Jean Guisnel and Bruno Tertrais. ""There will not be an M6, "" says the book, published last week.

Work has begun on the M51.3 version, intended to enter service around 2025, the book says. The aim is for the weapon, tipped with the

tête nucléare océanique

or oceanic nuclear warhead, to defeat all missile defense systems."
Airbus aircraft programs in review - Leeham News and Analysis,"Tue, 31 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNi8wNS8zMS9haXJidXMtYWlyY3JhZnQtcHJvZ3JhbXMtcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Bjorn Fehrm in Hamburg

Introduction

May 31, 2016, ©. Leeham Co: Airbus went through a complete review of all their aircraft programs as part of their yearly briefing for media in Hamburg today. A lot was said regarding the status for the different programs by Airbus CEO Farbice Bregier, its COO customers John Leahy and Executive VP Strategy and Marketing Kiran Rao.

The briefing was given against a backdrop of weak orders and deliveries for the first five months of the year. Both Bregier and Leahy said, “This is to be expected, it’s not sustainable that we have Book-to-Bill ratios (orders vs. deliveries) of over 1.5 or even close to two for many consecutive years. We have a backlog of 6,700 aircraft that customers expect us to deliver and they have little appetite to order new aircraft when they can earliest get them by 2021 at the earliest.

“We are now in a period of focus on deliveries and we can expect and be happy with a book to bill ratio of around one for the coming years. The extraordinary backlog also justifies our decision to increase production to 60 units per month for our A320 single aisle program.”

Here follows what was said for each of the programs.

A320

As previously described, the Pratt & Whitney-engined A320neo will resume deliveries with improved engines within the next month, figure 2. The LEAP-1A engine version received its joint FAA and EASA certification during the briefings. Deliveries of first LEAP engine aircraft will start in July.

The A320neo program manager Klaus Roewe pointed out that both engines fulfill the Airbus performance specification. It was mentioned that Lufthansa Airlines even sees over-performance on its first GTF-powered A320neo with fuel burn being around 16.5% lower than an A320ceo on typical short haul missions.

Officials were dismissive of the prospect of a Boeing 737-10, which Leahy dubbed the “Mad MAX.” The airplane would require a larger engine. Reuters reported Boeing is considering the LEAP-1A used on the A320neo rather than the smaller LEAP-1B. This is a different engine, removing commonality between the two. To accommodate the LEAP-1A, major structural changes would be required for the MAX 10, also reducing commonality to the rest of the MAX family.

Airbus can do an “A322,” a stretched version of the A321neo with a new wing, but at this stage doesn’t see the need to do so.

A330

The A330neo development is on track with first aircraft to TAP in Portugal entering final Assembly Line in Toulouse “within a couple of months”, Figure 3. Delivery is targeted for December 2017.

The aircraft has a new interior since the program was launched at Farnborough 2014. It is modeled after the A350 cabin and the joint marketing name for this cabin style is now “Airspace.” Initially it was said that only bins and lighting would get changed to the A350 style, but now all parts will be in A350 standard, including monuments, galleys, toilets, ceilings, lighting etc.

Airbus is studying a 245 tonne A330-900, which would add about 300nm to the range and bring it closer to the range of the Boeing 787-9 with which it competes. Alternatively, the 245t -900 could have three tonnes more cargo payload.

A350

The aircraft is proving to be more flexible than originally planned. This has allowed the creation of the 9.700nm A350-900ULR, which beat Boeing’s 777-8 at Singapore Airlines to fulfill the requirement to fly the 19 hours Singapore-New York and a bit shorter Singapore-Los Angeles missions.

The 280t Max takeoff weight will be a standard weight variant from 2020 and a A350-900ULR can be de-papered to a standard A350-900 or even a regional A350-900, all to save engine maintenance costs and en route and landing fees, Figure 4.

The A350-1000 first aircraft is now in outside Radio and Fuel system tests (Station 18) and will fly in September, Figure 5. First delivery of the aircraft is foreseen for 4Q2017. Airbus can already see that the aircraft will fulfill its performance guarantees.

A longer version what would compete with a 777-9 has also been defined. It can keep the wing and engines with minor modifications paired with a longer fuselage. Feedback from the airlines has not yet convinced Airbus that the market is large enough to justify the variant, which was called -2000 by Leahy. Bregier concluded, “We are ready to develop the version as soon as we see market for it. We now know we can develop it with a relatively small effort. Should airlines approach us with clear demand for the version, we can develop and get it to market relatively quickly. Right now the main market seems to be in the present 777-300ER size segment and there we have an aircraft in the -1000 which takes off 30 tonnes lighter for a typical mission and therefore is considerably more efficient.”

A380

The question of an A380neo came up and was immediately answered. “With the cabin density improvements we have done, the aircraft is the most efficient aircraft flying today,” said Leahy. “We therefore don”t see an immediate need for a neo version. But this aircraft will live on for another 30 to 40 years, so it’s clear, there will be an version with new engines. We will see when there is a need to do that.”

The improvements in the cabin is continuing and the latest changes are an elimination of the sidewall stowage areas on the top floor giving an additional 10 seats in the aircraft, Figure 6.

An ABC News aviation contributor deems it ""a great aircraft with a superb safety record.""

Fast Facts

Here some fast facts to know about the Airbus 320, according to Airbus:

The first A320 entered service in 1988. Since then, it's carried more than 10.5 billion passengers. (That's over 2.5 million passengers a day).

The A320 family includes the A318, A319, A320 and A321.

There are 6,713 A320s in operation as of last month. An A320 takes off or lands every two seconds.

Today’s A320s have an operational reliability of 99.7 percent.

EgyptAir

The cause of the EgyptAir crash remains under investigation. ABC News' aviation contributor Steve Ganyard said ""we still know too little to suggest that the A320 has a problem that would threaten the flying public's safety.""

Before the EgyptAir flight disappeared en route to Cairo from Paris last week, Airbus 320s were involved in 11 deadly crashes, in addition to the Germanwings plane that was intentionally crashed by a co-pilot in the French Alps last year, according to The Associated Press. An Airbus spokesperson could not immediately confirm the number of deadly crashes.

Ganyard told ABC News, ""The A320 is a great aircraft with a superb safety record -- which is why it is hard to conceive of a mechanical problem that would have led directly to [the EgyptAir] crash.""

As the desperate search for the EgyptAir flight's black box continues, a spokesperson for Airbus told ABC News today, ""In line with ICAO Annex 13 rules, Airbus is providing full technical assistance to the French Investigation Agency - BEA - and the Egyptian Investigation Authorities who leads the technical investigation. The Airbus Safety team coordinates our response and support to the authorities, including local support in Cairo.""

""The official authorities in charge of the investigation will start the research to determine the location of the pingers with the appropriate means,"" the statement said. ""This search could take from a few days to a few weeks."""
"With Perlan 2 glider, Airbus claims mantle of space pioneer (Update) - Phys.org","Sun, 08 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDE2LTA1LWFpcmJ1cy1zaWdodHMtc3RyYXRvc3BoZXJlLWdsaWRlci1mbGlnaHQuaHRtbNIBSmh0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDE2LTA1LWFpcmJ1cy1zaWdodHMtc3RyYXRvc3BoZXJlLWdsaWRlci1mbGlnaHQuYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus Perlan 2 returns to the landing strip following a test flight by Airbus Group CEO Tom Enders and chief pilot Jim Payne on May 7, 2016 at Minden-Tahoe Airport in Minden, Nevada

The space glider Perlan 2 is helping Airbus take on Silicon Valley's brightest innovators, even while pursuing technologies that might eventually lead to passenger flights in space.

The project's goal is to set an altitude record for the unpowered craft of 90,000 feet (27,400 meters) in the frigid temperatures at the edge of space (-70 Fahrenheit, -57 celsius), similar to the conditions on Mars.

The European aerospace firm has invested close to $4 million in the American group, Mission Perlan 2, which developed the ambitious project, and tested the craft Saturday in the skies over Nevada.

That sum makes Airbus the leading partner in Perlan 2, according to a source familiar with the deal. It represents 57 percent of the $7 million budget raised to build the glider.

If that amount seems paltry compared to the billions traditionally spent on new aeronautics technologies, it is still unexpected coming from a corporation whose work has always centered on passenger planes and helicopters.

""We make the airplane as simple as we can make it, so there is nothing we are doing that is cutting-edge for Airbus,"" Ed Warnock, chief executive of Perlan 2, told AFP.

Why, then, the interest by the huge conglomerate?

Airbus Group CEO Tom Enders (R) shakes hands with chief pilot Jim Payne after the two landed a test flight of the Airbus Perlan 2 on May 7, 2016 at Minden-Tahoe Airport in Nevada

""It's an innovative project; this one fits very well to our image, to our reputation as an innovative company,"" said Tom Enders, Airbus's boss, who was co-pilot during Perlan 2's flight Saturday, which was cut short by cloudy conditions.

""It can contribute to research, and more importantly it can keep enthusiasm for flights (and be) inspirational for younger generations.""

A 'leading force'

Experts say Airbus, founded in 1969 during the golden age of space conquest, figures that by linking itself to Perlan 2's stratospheric exploits, it can kill two birds with one stone.

If Perlan 2 manages to break the altitude record set in 1976 by the US Air Force's SR-71 reconnaissance plane—as it hopes to do later this year in Argentina—Airbus's name will go into the history books along with those of other great aeronautics pioneers.

At the same time, Airbus hopes to bask in the glow surrounding the visionary American billionaires Elon Musk (SpaceX) and Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) as they work to develop reusable launch vehicles.

The Airbus Perlan 2 (R) glider is pulled by a plane before a test flight on May 7, 2016 in Minden, Nevada

In less than 20 years, these late arrivals to the space race have become the center of attention for the aerospace industry, relegating traditional actors to the background.

Their technologies can also be used to collect data important for scientific research (as with climate change) or in detecting trends in natural resources like petroleum.

""Innovation is not happening just in Silicon Valley,"" Tom Enders said.

He said Airbus could be a ""leading force"" in expanding scientific horizons. ""We are not afraid"" to compete, he added.

So Airbus, which recently opened a center for technological innovation in California dubbed A3, plans to get as much media exposure as possible from Perlan 2.

The Airbus Perlan 2 manned glider is preparing for a flight soaring to the edge of space, about 90,000 feet

Next up: Helicopters on call?

But this is not its only futuristic project. In partnership with the Uber transportation company, Airbus wants to develop a helicopter-on-call service.

Even more ambitious is a plan to build a flying car using artificial intelligence.

As conventional air corridors grow more crowded, Airbus wants to use Perlan 2 as a ""platform"" to test plans for airplanes that could cruise at altitudes of up to 60,000 feet (18,300 meters), well above the current limits of 41,000 feet (12,500 meters).

Perlan 2 will be collecting data on the tropopause—the region between the troposphere, the lowest portion of Earth's atmosphere, and the stratosphere—to help determine at what point waves of moving air masses in that zone become ""dangerous type waves,"" said Ed Warnock.

""Are we really going to build gliders? Probably not,"" said Ken McKenzie, vice president for Airbus in North America.

""But do we care about the first pressurized glider that has ever flown—that sounds pretty interesting,"" he said.

""It's all carbon fiber—that's something we are excited about. They put integrated life support systems into a glider, and (we will) see how this can potentially be something we can use.""

Marco Caceres, a space analyst with the Teal Group, said Airbus aims to be a leading pioneer in the field.

Norway Crash: Airbus lifts global H225 grounding recommendation - Vertical Magazine,"Mon, 02 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3Mvbm9yd2F5LWNyYXNoLWFpcmJ1cy1saWZ0cy1nbG9iYWwtaDIyNS1ncm91bmRpbmctcmVjb21tZW5kYXRpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters has lifted its recommendation to suspend all commercial flights with the H225/EC225LP, but the aircraft remains grounded in the U.K. and Norway following Friday’s fatal crash near Turøy, Norway, which killed all 13 on board.

The aircraft involved in the accident was being flown by CHC Helicopter on behalf of Statoil, and was returning to Bergen from the Gullfaks B platform, 120 kilometers off the Norwegian mainland, when it went down on the edge of the island of Turøy.

According to flightradar24, ADS-B data show that the aircraft dropped 2,100 feet (640 meters) during the last 10 seconds of its flight, and video taken by those at the scene appears to show a main rotor spiralling through the air — corroborating eyewitness claims that it had detached from the aircraft while in flight. At the crash site, investigators found the main rotor a hundred meters from the fuselage.

In the hours following the crash, the U.K. and Norwegian civil aviation authorities each issued Safety Directives grounding all commercial flights of the EC225LP. Airbus Helicopters issued a statement that evening in which it supported the move and expanded it across the EC225LP fleet, issuing a Safety Information Notice to recommend the suspension of commercial flights in the aircraft.

“At this point in the investigation, we do not have any information that allows us to understand the causes of the accident that involved the aircraft’s rotor being detached, nor to make any links to events that have occurred previously,” the Airbus statement said. “The preliminary elements of the inquiry should become available in the coming days. Under these tragic circumstances, and until these elements are available, we are allied with the decision taken to put all commercial EC225LP passenger flights on hold.”

However, on May 1, Airbus issued another statement, recommending that flights of the EC225LP could resume outside of the U.K. and Norway. “Considering the additional information gathered during the last 48 hours, Airbus Helicopters’ decision, at this stage, is to not suspend flights of any nature for the EC225LP,” the statement said.

“However, out of respect for all those affected by the accident, Airbus Helicopters continues to stand by the decision taken by the Norwegian and UK authorities to put commercial EC225LP passenger flights on hold in Norway and in the U.K.”

In a statement issued to Vertical, Airbus Helicopters said preliminary inspection of the accident aircraft’s main gearbox vertical shaft has shown no link with two high-profile ditching events in the North Sea in 2012.

CHC was among a number of operators to bar its H225 fleet from over-water operations following the second ditching in 2012, which was found to be caused by a circumferential crack on the bevel gear vertical shaft, which meant the main and standby oil pump gears ceased to be driven."
FAA approves A350 XWB for 'beyond 180 minutes' ETOPS - Airbus,"Mon, 02 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNi0wNS1mYWEtYXBwcm92ZXMtYTM1MC14d2ItZm9yLWJleW9uZC0xODAtbWludXRlcy1ldG9wc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Summary

Includes option for 300min ETOPS capability; On target for full 370min approval this year

A350 XWB ‘beyond 180 minutes’ ETOPS capability now approved by both EASA and FAA

Enabling straighter more fuel efficient flight paths with lower CO2 emissions

Airbus’ A350-900 has been approved by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) for ETOPS (Extended-range twin-engine aircraft Operations) beyond 180 minutes diversion time

The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has approved the Airbus A350-900 for ETOPS* (Extended-range Twin engine aircraft Operations) ‘beyond 180 minutes’ diversion time. This approval means that when the first FAA-affiliated operators start to take delivery of their A350s in 2017 they will be able to serve new direct non-limiting routings, compared with a standard 180 minute ETOPS diversion time. It also means that now the A350 XWB is approved by both EASA and the FAA for beyond 180 minutes ETOPS.This FAA approval, which includes ‘ETOPS 180min’ in the basic specification, also includes provisions for up to ‘ETOPS 300min’ – corresponding to a maximum diversion distance of 2,000 nautical miles (nm) at one-engine-inoperative speed under standard atmospheric conditions. Later this year, once the type accumulates additional in-service experience, it will be granted a further provision for ‘ETOPS 370min’ from the FAA, which will extend the maximum diversion distance up to 2,500nm.The ETOPS 300min option will, in particular, facilitate more efficient transoceanic routes across the North and Mid-Pacific – such as from South-East Asia to US, and Australasia to the US. Meanwhile, operators flying on existing routes (currently flown with up to 180 minute diversion time) will be able to traverse straighter more fuel efficient flight paths with lower CO2 emissions, while also allowing access to more en-route diversion airports if needed.The granting by the FAA of this ETOPS capability prior to the A350’s delivery to US-based operators is a testimony to the FAA’s confidence in the aircraft maturity and in US operators who will soon operate the A350 XWB (including: American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines) – as well as the type’s demonstrated performance with the five current operators since its entry into service in 2015.The A350 XWB is Airbus’ all-new mid-size long range product line and a member of Airbus' leading Widebody family. The type sets new standards in terms of passenger experience, operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Around 70 percent of A350 flight hours will be ETOPS. At the end of March 2016, the A350 XWB had won 777 orders from 41 customers worldwide."
"ATR begins US tour, part owner wants to divorce Airbus - Leeham News and Analysis","Tue, 03 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNi8wNS8wMy9hdHItYmVnaW5zLXVzLXRvdXItd2FudHMtZGl2b3JjZS1haXJidXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"May 3, 2016, © Leeham Co.: ATR, the maker of the ATR turbo-prop, is beginning a tour of its aircraft in the US, the last uncontested domain for the rival Bombardier Q400.

ATR won orders for its ATR-42/72 in the US decades ago, but largely ceded the market to Bombardier. ATR-42s fly for FedEx, the express package carrier, but no

passenger ATRs are in service in the USA.

As the tour gets underway, Finmeccania, a 50% owner of ATR with Airbus owning the other half, wants to assume the latter’s holdings if Airbus doesn’t change its mind over its refusal to green light development of a next generation turbo-prop.

Airbus has for several years refused to grant approval because ATR had between 80% and 90% of the backlog at any given time. Bombardier had the remaining market share backlog. Now that oil prices are low, Airbus doesn’t believe a business case can me made to justify a new development.

Reuters reported last week that Finmeccanica “is discussing with France’s Airbus the possibility of taking full control of regional planemaker ATR, Chief Executive Mauro Moretti said on Thursday. “Our partners do not want to develop, so either we convince them to invest or we convince them to strike a deal that will give us control,” Moretti said, speaking at the annual shareholders meeting in Rome,” Reuters reported.

American Eagle, a unit of American Airlines, was a major operator of the ATR-72. One of its airplanes crashed en route to Chicago in 1994. The probable cause was due to icing. The accident revealed a previously unknown tendency to ice in certain conditions. The problem was later resolved, but the ATR disappeared from US routes over the next several years.

Bombardier’s Dash 8 and Q-Series airplanes, designed differently, became the staple of turbo-prop operations in Canada and the US. But elsewhere, ATR, whose airplanes cost less to acquire and were cheaper to operate against the high-speed design of the Q400, became dominate in the rest of the world. In an interview with LNC in March 2015, ATR’s CEO expressed an interest to refocus on the US market.

That time has come.

ATR says that more than “30% of the routes operated by regional jets in the US are below 300 miles, a range where the operating costs and fuel-efficiency of the newest generation ATR -600s are unrivaled.”

Germany Presses Airbus to Resolve A400M Problems - Defense News,"Wed, 18 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS90cmFpbmluZy1zaW0vMjAxNi8wNS8xOC9nZXJtYW55LXByZXNzZXMtYWlyYnVzLXRvLXJlc29sdmUtYTQwMG0tcHJvYmxlbXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"BERLIN — The German government on Wednesday urgently pressed European airplane manufacturer Airbus to come up with a precise plan for resolving the problems that have repeatedly set back delivery of its new military transport, the A400M.

""We urge the manufacturer to come up with a feasible and workable plan,"" a spokesman for the defense ministry, Jens Flosdorff, told a news briefing.

After new faults were discovered in the aircraft's engines and cracks in its fuselage, ""what is important [for the German government] is that the manufacturer present a plan with which it will be able to resolve these issues in the coming months,"" Flosdorff said.

It was not yet fully clear how serious the problems were, he added.

The German army, the main customer for Airbus' military aircraft, has ordered around 50 A400M to replace its aging fleet of Transall planes.

It has taken delivery of three, which have revealed a number of faults.

""Naturally, we're examining all options"" in case the A400M transports are not delivered in time, the ministry spokesman continued. These included the possibility of seeking compensation from Airbus.

The Airbus A400M military transport was briefly grounded last year after one of the airlifters crashed during a test flight near the Spanish city of Seville, killing four people."
Airbus Wins Contract To Support British Helicopter Fleet - Defense News,"Fri, 20 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9nbG9iYWwvZXVyb3BlLzIwMTYvMDUvMjAvYWlyYnVzLXdpbnMtY29udHJhY3QtdG8tc3VwcG9ydC1icml0aXNoLWhlbGljb3B0ZXItZmxlZXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON — The British Ministry of Defence (MoD) has announced a near £500 million deal that will see future military rotorcraft training undertaken on a fleet of around 30 Airbus helicopters.

According to Friday's announcement, the UK arm of Airbus Helicopters will build and support its H135 and H145 platforms as part of the military flying training system (MFTS) program being managed for the MoD by Ascent Flying Training.

Airbus Helicopters UK defense business boss Ian Morris said that due to the tight timelines involved, the company had built the helicopters at its own risk for months in anticipation of securing a deal that was only signed in the last few days.

The schedule involves the rotary-wing aircraft being fully operational by April 2018, Ian Morris said.

""It was always an extremely tight time frame. We have to move from contract signature a few days ago to full service providing 28,000 flying hours a year by April 1, 2018. Under the normal way of doing things that's nearly incomprehensible, so we made a strategic decision back in the late summer of 2015 as we completed our offer to start building aircraft at risk,"" he said.

Eight aircraft are in various stages of the manufacturing process at the Airbus assembly site at Donauwörth, Germany.

Morris said up to four machines were likely to have been delivered to the UK by the end of the year for minor customization ahead of delivery.

The executive said Airbus was confident they wouldn't end up with whitetails as the UK customer's requirement is very close to the normal core aircraft coming off the production line.

Airbus declined to give the number of helicopters included in the deal but graphics provided by the MoD show the new fleet will comprise 29 H135's and three H-145's.

""Ascent's [requirement] wanted the bidders to deliver 28,000 flying hours per year with an average of 110/120 sorties a day, and that's the basis we created the fleet on,"" he said.

The H145 has a bigger cabin but identical avionics to the H135. The larger helicopter will primarily be used for maritime and mountain crew training.

The total value of the rotary-wing training contract is around £1.1 billion — a figure which includes Ascent's owners supplying ground-based training equipment, infrastructure and integrated support.

Jointly owned by Babcock International and Lockheed Martin, Ascent has a 25-year, private finance initiative deal with the MoD to train British military rotary- and fixed-wing crews through to 2033.

The MoD said in a statement that the deal brings spending on the MFTS program to £2.8 billion with fast-jet, rotary-, fixed- and rear-crew training programs now under contract.

The total value of the rotary-wing training contract is around £1.1 billion — a figure which includes Ascent's owners supplying ground-based training equipment, infrastructure and integrated support.

""This is the final element in refashioning the UK MFTS into a state-of-the-art structure to develop suitably qualified aircrew to secure the future of air elements of our Royal Navy, British Army and Royal Air Force. Our armed forces will benefit from consistent, world-class training across the board, "" Minister of State for Defence Procurement Philip Dunne said.

The program has previously faced criticism by the parliamentary Public Accounts Committee and others for long delays in implementation, although the problems now appear to have been resolved.

The final two major core programs to reequip Britain's flying training effort have been signed in a matter of months.

Ascent signed a deal worth around £500 million in February with the KBR/Elbit owned Affinity Flying Training Services for the procurement and support of three different types of fixed-wing training aircraft.

Total costs of the fixed-wing deal, including the Affinity element, is put at around £1.1 billion by the MoD.

Speculation Airbus had secured the helicopter deal surfaced May 19 after Defense News reported that Paul Livingstone, the boss of Ascent, had been a guest of Airbus at a major industry dinner in London the previous evening.

The 17-year contract between Ascent and Airbus is scheduled to see students start training on the helicopters in 2018.

The fleet of helicopters are expected to deliver the 28,000 hours a year required for the British training needs.

Award of the contract to Airbus will be a further blow to rival Cobham, which had been challenging for the deal offering Leonardo-Finmeccancia helicopters.

Cobham shares plunged recently following a profit warning and a move to tap shareholders for a £500 million rights issue.

Peter Nottage, Cobham Aviation Services president, said the company was ""very disappointed not to have been selected to provide the ongoing services. Cobham expect[s] the vast majority of staff to transfer to the new service providers and other projects.""

The company currently provides military helicopter training services for the British primarily at a Royal Air Force base at Shawbury, England, using 38 Squirrel and 14 Griffin machines.

Training is also conducted at the Army Air Corps base at Middle Wallop, England, and RAF Valley in North Wales.

Airbus Helicopters to retrofit the Sécurité Civile's 35 EC145 - Airbus,"Wed, 11 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNi0wNS1haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtdG8tcmV0cm9maXQtdGhlLXNlY3VyaXRlLWNpdmlsZXMtMzUtZWMxNDXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Summary

Airbus Helicopters confirmed as the industrial partner of choice for the Sécurité Civile



Marignane, Airbus Helicopters has been awarded a contract by the French Defence Procurement Agency (DGA) to retrofit the avionics suite of the 35 EC145 helicopters operated by the Sécurité Civile, an agency of the French Ministry of Interior that performs critical search and rescue and medical evacuation services throughout the French territory.



As part of this retrofit, all aircraft will be equipped with an improved avionics suite allowing them to retain their ability to perform missions in all weather conditions with the highest levels of safety, while at the same time complying with the latest Performance Based Navigation regulations.



“We are very proud of the trust that the Sécurité Civile has placed in our support and services with this second contract in less than a year” said Matthieu Louvot, Airbus Helicopters Executive Vice President Customer Support and Services. “It is a great honour for us to be confirmed as the industrial partner of choice by this reference EC145 operator to which we are also providing a comprehensive, nose-to-tail global service solution”.



The retrofit of the 35 aircraft follows on from the global services solution contract for the Sécurité Civile and Gendarmerie Nationale’s EC145 fleet awarded at the end of 2015. The aircraft, with this new contract managed by the Military Support Centre France (MSC-F), will be retrofitted over a seven-year period by Airbus Helicopters personnel deployed at the Sécurité Civile base in Nîmes in order to minimise the impact on the operational activity. The mechanical and electrical modifications necessary to integrate functions such as LPV/SBAS guidance, digital maps, and GPS installations have also been optimized to reduce the length of the retrofit operations.



“This retrofit programme ensures that our EC145s will remain capable of meeting the most demanding operational requirements with the highest levels of safety”, said Victor Devouge, head of aviation means for the Sécurité Civile. “This fleet is now enjoying an availability rate of around 95% which is absolutely essential in allowing us to perform our daily operations”, he added.



Established in 1957, the helicopter division of the Sécurité Civile operates a fleet of 35 EC145 on call 24/7 throughout France for search and rescue and medical evacuation missions. In 2015 alone they flew over 16,000 flight hours, rescuing 16,000 people.



The MSC-F is a dedicated Airbus Helicopters organisation designed to support all French military and state customers by providing them with the most tailored services fitting their specific needs. The creation of this entity illustrates Airbus Helicopters’ commitment to service quality and performance to keep customers flying, anytime, anywhere.

In 2002 Airbus patented a trap door to keep terrorists away from the cockpit - ZME Science,"Tue, 31 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnptZXNjaWVuY2UuY29tL290aGVyL2RpZC15b3Uta25vdy9haXJidXMtdHJhcC1kb29yLXBhdGVudC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Facebook

In the wake of 9/11, airports all over the world ramped security heavily to counter the risk of a terrorist threat. Around this time, spirits were high so quite a few bold ideas were thrown on the table, some more outlandish than others. Take this 2002 patent by Airbus which involves fitting a freaking trap door in front of the cockpit’s entrance. Once in position, a demanding but unsuspecting terrorist would find the floor underneath him collapse at the whim of the pilot who only needs to press a red button.

“In an aircraft cabin floor adjacent to the cockpit, a trap door opens downwardly into a security cell, to trap a terrorist trying to enter the cockpit. Two walls with lockable airtight doors bound a safety buffer cabin between the cockpit and the passenger cabin,” the authors of the patent wrote.

The trap door is one aspect of a far broader anti-terrorist security system Airbus had in mind. In the same patent, engineers thought about placing all sorts of sensors virtually on every seat in the cabin. These sensors can monitor passenger traffic inside the cabin, for instance, and signal an alarm to both the cockpit and ground control that suspicious activity that doesn’t fall in a predefined pattern is happening. The pilots inside the cockpit can then activate countermeasures like turning off the lights in the cabin, using an extremely intense and annoying pneumatic horn, injecting sleeping gas, and much more.

“Sensors like seat occupancy sensors, motion detectors, video cameras and microphones provide data regarding the location, movement and activities of passengers to a system that evaluates the data to recognize unusual data situations indicating one or more escalation levels of suspicious or aggressive actions by passengers. Alarm signals and terrorist countermeasure devices such as fogging or tranquilizer gas generators, noise generators, high intensity blinding/glaring lights, a cabin lighting master shut-off, window darkening devices, and tranquilizer dart guns are actuated automatically by the evaluation system, or manually by a cockpit input device or a portable signaling device carried by a flight attendant.”

This patent never made it past the drawing board, though. Most likely, Airbus thought fitting a tranquilizer dart gun that can be fired remotely from the cockpit by a man wearing night vision goggles (seriously) is a bit too much. I think so too, but still way more moderate than another crazy patent ZME Science featured: a detachable passenger and cargo cabin that springs away from the aircraft in case of emergency, then safely lands via parachute. Oh, gosh…

What do you think? Is this what safe flying is all about? Would you fly in one of these?

"Airbus Unveils Thor, Their Fully 3D Printed Unmanned Test Aircraft - 3DPrint.com","Tue, 31 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vM2RwcmludC5jb20vMTM2NTcwL2FpcmJ1cy10aG9yLXVhdi_SAS9odHRwczovLzNkcHJpbnQuY29tLzEzNjU3MC9haXJidXMtdGhvci11YXYvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When it comes to nurturing and promoting advancements in 3D printing technology, very few companies have taken the initiative that the European airline manufacturer Airbus has. The aerospace manufacturer started fully immersing itself into the world of additive manufacturing back around 2014, when they equipped their A350 airliner with a titanium 3D printed cabin bracket, and also utilized the first 3D printed spare part on an aircraft being used by Air Transnat. Since then, 3D printing developments and innovations have come rapidly apace from Airbus. Their A350 XWB aircraft is now comprised of over 1,000 3D printed parts, while German RepRap printers have helped to develop more effective camera mounts and windshield wiper systems for their helicopters.

Just about a week ago, Airbus filed a patent for a 3D printing process that would be capable of 3D printing an entire sturdy and functional airplane, hinting at a future where airliners will lift off straight from the print bed. Although the idea behind this recently filed patent will likely take a fair amount of time to fully develop, it seems that Airbus is already on its way to flying fully 3D printed aircraft. At their manufacturing plant in Hamburg, Germany, Peter Sander, the head of emerging technologies & concepts at Airbus, shared with the press at Innovation Days 2016 that Airbus had designed, built, and tested an entirely 3D printed unmanned aircraft vehicle (UAV).

The 3D printed UAV is named Thor, which is an acronym for Test of High-tech Objectives in Reality. According to Sander, the aircraft will serve as a test platform for high risk and aerodynamic investigations, which will be used to further prove the viability of this 3D printed concept UAV. Thor is comprised of around 50 3D printed parts, two electric motors, and a remote control, essentially making the aircraft fully 3D printed. As Airbus continues to test and refine their 3D printed UAV, they are able to reprint and replace parts in a matter of days and weeks as opposed to a conventional manufacturing process, which would take months.

“You can [3D] print this kind of aircraft in four weeks,” Sander reportedly stated in his presentation to the media. “It has low lead times for fast track developments.”

The unmanned aircraft was first tested back in November, taking flight for 40 km from Hamburg to their plant in Stade, Germany. Coming off of the successful testing, Airbus has scheduled 18 test missions for their 3D printed UAV throughout 2016. The entire unmanned aircraft is reported to weigh around 25kg, and has a length and a wingspan that measures out to about four meters each. The initiative is being worked on across the different Airbus company sectors, such as Airbus Defense & Space and Airbus Helicopters. The production cost of Thor is estimated at about 20,000 euros, which is quite the bargain for this type of flying testbed.

The 3D print UAV will be exhibited at the ILA Berlin Air Show, which is taking place from June 1-4 at the Berlin ExpoCenter Airport. Thor was named after the most renowned of the Norse gods, one who is generally identified with thunder; it’s a name that fits the innovative and ground-breaking nature of their UAV project. As Airbus continues to test Thor among their other 3D printing-based developments, they’re brewing the perfect storm for the additive manufacturing takeover, which could soon lead to UAVs being manufactured at the speed of lightning.

There’s never been anything quite like it.

Aviation master Airbus has just unveiled the new must-have luxury helicopter for the billionaire and celebrity set. The $22 million H160 VIP is a super-luxe variant of the world’s most technologically advanced chopper, and it’s a veritable Maybach for the skies.

It’s based on the H160, the world’s first all-composite civil helicopter, a lightweight whirlybird that can cruise at a blistering 185 mph with a range of 500 miles and a whisper-quiet ride. Airbus Helicopters (formerly Europcopter) spent over $1 billion developing the sleek ride.

The 12-passenger aircraft features two new fuel-efficient Turbomeca Arrano turboshaft engines that create upwards of 1,300 shaft horsepower and Airbus’ high tech new Blue Edge blades, which feature a hockey stick-shaped leading edge at the outer tip designed to reduce the noise generated by blade-vortex interaction.

The interior meanwhile comes upholstered in rich leather with wood and metal accents and can be customized to the buyer’s specifications. Airbus launched a design contest last fall with five top-flight design firms competing to create the H160 VIP cabin interior. The company calls the result an “unrivaled combination of innovation, design and performance.”

Orders are slated to begin delivery in 2018 while Airbus puts the finishing touches on the prototype, which has reached a maximum altitude of 20,000 feet and performed turns at a jet-like 2.2G.

Actually, make that the Bugatti of the skies…."

The cause of the crash is undetermined.

The airliner was an Airbus A320-232, registration number SU-GCC, and it was delivered to EgyptAir by Airbus on November 3, 2003.

SU-GCC was relatively new for an aircraft of its type. In fact, it was the youngest of the 11 A320s in the EgyptAir fleet.

According to an incident report by the Egyptian Air Accident Investigation Directorate, SU-GCC was forced to make an emergency landing in Cairo on June 25, 2013. According to the report, one of its engines overheated as the plane climbed past 24,000 feet. Investigators cited a technical defect in the engine as the likely cause for the overheating. No injuries were reported.

IAE is an international joint venture consisting of the Connecticut-based Pratt & Whitney, the Japanese Aero Engines Corporation, and MTU Aero Engines of Germany.

The Airbus A320 is a single-aisle, short- to medium-range airliner and is designed to operate multiple flights in one day.

Airbus has sold 12,499 aircraft in the A320 family of jets since the aircraft's debut in 1988, and it is the best-selling airplane in the world in the past 25 years.

According to Airbus, more than 6,700 of the planes are in service today.

Airbus released the following statement:

Airbus regrets to confirm that an A320 operated by Egyptair was lost at around 02:30 am (Egypt local time) today over the Mediterranean sea. The aircraft was operating a scheduled service, Flight MS 804 from Paris, France to Cairo, Egypt.



The aircraft involved, registered under SU-GCC was MSN (Manufacturer Serial Number) 2088 delivered to Egyptair from the production line in November 2003. The aircraft had accumulated approximately 48,000 flight hours. It was powered by IAE engines. At this time no further factual information is available.



In line with ICAO annex 13, Airbus stands-by ready to provide full technical assistance to French Investigation Agency — BEA — and to the Authorities in charge of the investigation.



The first A320 entered service in March 1988. At the end of April 2016 over 6700 A320 Family aircraft were in operation worldwide. To date, the entire fleet has accumulated nearly 180 million flight hours in over 98 million flights.



Our concerns go to all those affected.

Overall, the A320 has a stellar service and safety record over the past 25 years. The plane helped pioneer fly-by-wire control technology that is now common in modern airliners. According to the Air Safety Network, the A320 has been involved in just 24 incidents in which the plane had to be discarded.

Before Flight 804, the most recent fatal incident involving an A320 occurred in March 2015, when Germanwings Flight 9525 crashed into the French Alps. The cause of the crash has been attributed to the deliberate actions of the plane's copilot, who was deemed to be suicidal at the time of the flight.

The most recent fatal crash of an A320 attributed to a mechanical failure occurred in December 2014 when AirAsia Flight 8501 crashed the Java Sea. Indonesian investigators blamed the crash on a failure in plane's rudder-control unit."
Airbus unveils the world's first 3D printed electric motorcycle: Light Rider - Electrek,"Tue, 24 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZWxlY3RyZWsuY28vMjAxNi8wNS8yNC9haXJidXMtM2QtcHJpbnRlZC1lbGVjdHJpYy1tb3RvcmN5Y2xlLWxpZ2h0LXJpZGVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has a wholly-owned subsidiary called APWorks, which is set up to develop additive manufacturing techniques – especially metallic 3D printing – for the supply chains of Airbus’ main businesses. From time to time, the company releases independent products developed through their manufacturing work for Airbus.

The latest of such product is particularly interesting to us at Electrek: a 3D printed all-electric motorcycle.

Airbus is claiming that the Light Rider is the world’s first 3D printed electric motorcycle.

I’m using the word ‘motorcycle’ liberally here as the Light Rider probably falls more accurately somewhere in-between an high-end electric bike like Rimac’s Greyp and a low-end full-fledged electric motorcycle.

Nonetheless, the bike features some impressive specs. Thanks to APWorks proprietary 3D printing material, Scalmalloy – an aluminum alloy, the vehicle is weighing in at only 35 kg (77 lbs). That’s the overall system with the 6 kW motor, battery pack and mechanical parts.

The frame itself only weights 6 kg (13 lbs). It also clearly looks like it’s 3D printed and APWorks says that it was a deliberate choice:

“APWorks used an algorithm to develop the Light Rider’s optimized structure to keep weight at a minimum while ensuring the motorcycle’s frame was strong enough to handle the weight loads and stresses of everyday driving scenarios. The result: a motorcycle that looks more like an organic exoskeleton than a machine. That was a very deliberate design goal for APWorks, which programmed the algorithm to use bionic structures and natural growth processes and patterns as the basis for developing a strong but lightweight structure.”

Its hollow frame allows for integrated cables and pipes for the vehicle’s powertrain.

The swappable battery enables a range of 60 km (37 miles) on a single charge. The top speed is 80 km/h (50 mph) and it can accelerate from 0 to 45 km/h (28 mph) in 3 seconds. Depending on where you are located, it’s likely that you wouldn’t need a motorcycle license to ride the Light Rider.

While the concept’s main role seems to be showcasing APWorks’ technology, the company is going ahead with a limited production run of 50 Light Riders for sale – though we are talking about a ridiculous price tag here: €50,000 ($56,000 USD).

Here’s a gallery and video of the Light Rider below:"

Minimising harmful VOC (volatile organic compound) emissions is a continuing focus at Airbus as part of its multi-pronged Blue5 initiative for improved environmental performance. Since 2006, the company has made impressive progress – decreasing VOC emissions by more than 60 per cent compared to revenue (and nearly 30 per cent in absolute terms) across its European sites.This improvement was underscored with recent achievements in Europe – such as the installation of a new washer for painting tools at Saint-Eloi, France; the replacement of a solvent-based primer with a water-based alternative at Puerto Real, Spain; and implementation of a new water-based touch-up paint dispensing/distribution process at Broughton, UK. In addition to the VOC guidelines, Blue5 sets targets for conserving energy and water, as well as reducing waste and CO2 emissions."

Imagine the surprise when the gate personnel at London Heathrow Airport identified one of the 22 wheels on an Airbus A380 was essentially a perfect square.

The A380 had just landed at Heathrow, and the British Airways flight had arrived after approximately 13 hours of flying from Hong Kong. The Aviation Herald said the pilots reported that a tire pressure warning went off shortly after the departure. Knowing the incident was minor, the crew decided to continue the flight and experienced no trouble during the landing at Heathrow.

So far there are no conclusive answers as to why the tire of the Airbus A380 took on this unusual shape. Several experts have commented on the event, most of whom admit they really have no clue how this could happen. Kumar Mysore from the Royal Aeronautic Society offered up a vague explanation, as reported by the Daily Mail: “The effect is the same as when you squeeze a rubber ring toy with different intensity, it can turn into a different shape. In an A380, for this particular situation, it happens to be squarish.”"

Airbus Helicopters has been awarded a contract by the French Defense Procurement Agency to retrofit the avionics suite of the 35 EC145 helicopters operated by the Sécurité Civile, an agency of the French Ministry of Interior that performs critical search-and-rescue and medical evacuation services throughout the French territory.

As part of this retrofit, all aircraft will be equipped with an improved avionics suite allowing them to retain their ability to perform missions in all weather conditions with the highest levels of safety, while at the same time complying with the latest performance based navigation regulations.

“We are very proud of the trust that the Sécurité Civile has placed in our support and services with this second contract in less than a year,” said Matthieu Louvot, Airbus Helicopters executive vice president of customer support and services. “It is a great honor for us to be confirmed as the industrial partner of choice by this reference EC145 operator to which we are also providing a comprehensive, nose-to-tail global service solution.”

The retrofit of the 35 aircraft follows on from the global services solution contract for the Sécurité Civile and Gendarmerie Nationale’s EC145 fleet awarded at the end of 2015. The aircraft, with this new contract managed by the Military Support Center France (MSC-F), will be retrofitted over a seven-year period by Airbus Helicopters personnel deployed at the Sécurité Civile base in Nîmes in order to minimize the impact on the operational activity.

The mechanical and electrical modifications necessary to integrate functions such as localizer performance with vertical guidance/ satellite-based augmentation system guidance, digital maps, and GPS installations have also been optimized to reduce the length of the retrofit operations.

“This retrofit program ensures that our EC145s will remain capable of meeting the most demanding operational requirements with the highest levels of safety,” said Victor Devouge, head of aviation means for the Sécurité Civile. “This fleet is now enjoying an availability rate of around 95 percent, which is absolutely essential in allowing us to perform our daily operations.”

Established in 1957, the helicopter division of the Sécurité Civile operates a fleet of 35 EC145 on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, throughout France for search-and-rescue and medical evacuation missions. In 2015 alone they flew over 16,000 flight hours, rescuing 16,000 people.

The MSC-F is a dedicated Airbus Helicopters organization designed to support all French military and state customers by providing them with the most tailored services fitting their specific needs. The creation of this entity illustrates Airbus Helicopters’ commitment to service quality and performance to keep customers flying, anytime, anywhere."
China's 'Land Airbus' will let you drive directly under a bus - Motor Authority,"Fri, 27 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vdG9yYXV0aG9yaXR5LmNvbS9uZXdzLzExMDQxNzVfY2hpbmFzLWxhbmQtYWlyYnVzLXdpbGwtbGV0LXlvdS1kcml2ZS1kaXJlY3RseS11bmRlci1hLWJ1c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A new take on mass transit may be headed to China as early as the end of the year: A so-called ""Land Airbus"" system that looks like an overgrown monorail as it motors over existing lanes of traffic.

The big catch: cars can actually drive under the Land Airbus.

For now, the concept only exists as a scale model created by the Shenzen Hashi Future Parking Equipment and as an animated video by Transit Explore Bus. Both Chinese firms intend to work together to deploy a full-size trial version on urban Chinese roads by August of this year, they said this week at an expo in Beijing. The first unit is currently under construction in China.

Chinese Land Airbus concept

The Land Airbus moves at about 37 mph, but its real utility lies in its human-carrying capacity: As many as 1,400 people can be squeezed onto a single bus at once. It's also said to be cheaper than trains or tram systems.

In addition, compared to a rail system or a subway, the Land Airbus can be built and deployed much quicker in order to remedy immediate traffic concerns. The Airbus travels on rails mounted to existing roadways and is high enough off the ground for cars to fit under it, but large buses and trucks would be a no-go. However, big trucks are banned from the urban areas of many Chinese cities anyway.

The Land Airbus is meant more for local transit than Tesla Motors [NSDQ:TSLA] CEO Elon Musk's proposed Hyperloop system being developed in the United States. The Land Airbus would also require significantly less investment in infrastructure, although it doesn't move nearly as quickly."

Moonwalk to Mars - Airbus,"Fri, 13 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE2LTA1LW1vb253YWxrLXRvLW1hcnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Spacewalks on Earth – Project Moonwalk unites seven European partners, including Airbus, to develop and test technologies for future human missions to Mars.

Helping hand for astronauts

“I’m convinced that we will plant the European flag on Mars sooner or later,” says Víctor Parro, a microbiologist from the Center for Astrobiology, Madrid. Parro is a member of Moonwalk, an exciting project to simulate a manned mission to Mars.

With seven partners, including Airbus, Moonwalk is developing innovative technologies for cooperative human-robot space exploration. Astronauts equipped with an extravehicular suit are supported by a small rover. The project, funded by the European Commission, is working on a man-machine interface for efficient robot control using gestures.

“The role of Airbus in Project Moonwalk is to provide biomonitoring support so that we can incorporate technology in the suit that allows mission control to understand the physiological and psychological state of the astronaut,” says Michael McDowell, data scientist at Airbus Innovations (AGI).

Which way is up?

Project Moonwalk’s consortium is made up of Airbus, COMEX, LIQUIFER Systems Group (LSG), Space Application Services (SAS), NTNU Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Space and Instituto Nacional de Técnica Aeroespacial.

“In low gravity, orientation is difficult. In a pressurised space suit your range of movement is also very restricted. How do astronauts know which way up is, for example? Or if they’re going to get stuck in a certain position? Reading data from movement sensors allows us to provide assistance and warnings where necessary,” explains Alistair Nottle from AGI’s Data Analysis & Interaction team in the UK.

A second development adopts the same sensors as the gesture controls. “By using a system integrated in the suit, we can detect if the astronaut is close to falling over. This happened a few times during the Apollo missions. When we receive an alarm, we can tell the astronaut to be careful and adjust position,” adds German engineer Peter Weiss, from the French company Comex, technical coordinator of the ‘pretend’ mission to Mars

The YEMO rover during the Moonwalk project's first Mars mission simulation in the Spanish town of Minas de Rio Tinto.

Climbing the 'Martian' ramps

The Moonwalk simulations at Rio Tinto represent the first demonstration of collaboration between an astronaut and a gesture-controlled rover. Equipped with blades instead of wheels, the YEMO micro-rover has been developed by the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI).

Capable of carrying a 5 kg payload of collected samples, YEMO has been climbing the ‘Martian’ ramps at Rio Tinto, but will also be tested underwater off the coast of Marseilles as part of testing for future missions to the Moon.

The Gandolfi 2 spacesuit outside the Self-Deployable Habitat for Extreme Environments (SHEE). Airbus Innovations is developing biomedical monitoring technology for the suit.

From rover to rover

At Rio Tinto, scientific operations have included in-situ surveys with a portable Raman spectroscope, capable of detecting minerals and organic compounds. Samples were taken back to a planetary habitat simulator to be analysed by SOLID (Signs Of Life Detector).

“If we are able to send a mission like this to Mars, then we are convinced that we will detect remains of life if they are there,” says Víctor Parro.

While YEMO was negotiating the Rio Tinto landscape, on 29 April 2016, European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut Tim Peake successfully took remote control of the rover ‘Bridget’ in the UK, all the way from the International Space Station. This Airbus Defence and Space prototype rover is part of ESA's Meteron project that is preparing for future human-robotic missions to the Moon, Mars and other celestial bodies.

“Today, Mars. Tomorrow, the stars”

During the testing campaign, the Moonwalk consortium also invited children aged 6 to 14 to participate in the project, asking for suggestions for the first words to be spoken on Mars.

The winning sentence, by 7-year-old Guadalupe Maíz Apellániz from Spain was: “Today, Mars. Tomorrow, the stars”.

7-year-old Guadalupe Maíz Apellániz from Spain suggested: “Today, Mars. Tomorrow, the stars” to be the first words to be spoken on Mars.

Diego Urbina, Project Moonwalk astronaut

A Colombian-Italian electronics engineer, Diego Urbina is simulating Mars by testing the Gandolfi 2 spacesuit and the extravehicular communications system with Alistair Nottle and Michael McDowell, from Airbus Innovations.

Italian-Colombian astronaut Diego Urbina tests the Gandolfi 2 spacesuit next to the YEMO rover, developed by DFKI in partnership with Airbus, during the Moonwalk project's first Mars mission simulation.

What is the human-machine interface?

It mimics several flight-like parameters, such as communications delay. One very important development is the possibility of having sensors on the body of the astronaut during spacewalks, when they are in the suit and working really hard. All of this information has to travel to Earth and it takes between 7 and 20 minutes to arrive.

How does the simulation work?

We connect the sensors developed by Airbus to our computer and then simulate the time that it takes the signals to get to Earth. From the Brussels Control Centre at Space Applications Services, mission controllers can look at the health of the astronaut and decide whether he can continue with the spacewalk, keeping in mind that this information arrives seven minutes ‘late’.

How long does it take to travel to Mars?

It’s a very long trip. It takes about eight months to go, and then you could either stay on the surface for around a month, or you would have to stay for more than a year. And then, of course, it takes another eight months to come back. There are many challenges to overcome, both in terms of the engineering required and surviving the hostile environment.

Last month, the US Patent and Trademark Office approved an application from Airbus Helicopters' Axel Fink, Ambrosius Weiss, and Andrew Winkworth for a new compound copter.

The patented design is a yet unnamed development of the company's revolutionary X3 experimental copter that first flew in 2010.

The concept is also part of Airbus Helicopters' — formerly Eurocopter — high speed, long-range, hybrid helicopter (H3) initiative.

Related stories

During testing, the X3 managed to reach 293 mph, making it the fastest non-tilt-rotor helicopter in the world. The new patent offers a development on the original X3 design.

What makes the new aircraft a compound copter are its pair of wing-mounted engines with pusher propellers in addition to the conventional main rotor. This design eliminates the need for a tail rotor to counter the torque of the main rotor.

A helicopter with additional pusher or puller propellers is far from new, and various versions have been flying for decades. But a copter with this layout and such high performance is novel.

This design also helps the copter reach the performance levels of tilt-rotor aircraft such as the V22 Osprey that can take off and land like a helicopter but transform into a conventional aircraft for horizontal flight.

Unlike the X3 prototype, the patented aircraft's propellers are mounted behind the wings instead of in front. According to the patent, this helps reduce noise and vibrations while improving lift and passenger safety. The patent authors indicate that further development of the design will include turbojet engines. This means that the patented helicopter will likely be significantly faster than the record-setting X3.

This new patent could also be the latest development of the Low Impact Fast and Efficient Rotor-Craft, or LifeRCraft, to which Airbus Helicopters hinted in 2014. That project is also based on the X3 concept.

It is unclear if the patented compound helicopter will ever see production in its current guise.

American Airlines already operates the world’s largest fleet of Airbus aircraft and the largest A321 fleet. With this delivery, we are adding a very special aircraft to those already sporting the American livery – an Airbus aircraft built here in the USA. This is the first of many American Airlines airplanes to be delivered from Mobile, and we are proud it will join a growing, thriving fleet.”David Seymour, Senior Vice President-Integrated Operations for American Airlines said, “Having Airbus produce its world-class aircraft in the United States has simplified our delivery process. It’s an honor to take delivery of this A321 today, and we thank everyone working in this facility for producing a high-quality aircraft for us.”Airbus announced its commitment to build a single-aisle assembly line in Mobile, Alabama in 2012, and less than one year later, broke ground on the $600 million facility. The ceremonial inauguration of the plant took place in September 2015. The aircraft delivered today, an American Airlines A321, successfully had its first flight on April 19, 2016.Airbus anticipates delivering four aircraft per month from the Mobile plant by the end of 2017. The initial deliveries will all be A320 Family aircraft with the Current Engine Option (CEO), but will begin transitioning to New Engine Option (NEO) derivatives in late 2017.In addition to hundreds of new Airbus jobs the project has brought to the local community, the Mobile area has seen many Airbus suppliers open new facilities in the region, providing even more employment and a parallel boost to the local economy. Airbus is proud to boast that 87 percent of its new employees are from the Gulf Coast region, with nearly one third being U.S. military veterans.Demonstrating the adage “The Sun Never Sets on Airbus Manufacturing” – Airbus aircraft are now produced around the clock, 24 hours a day, at facilities in: Mobile, Alabama; Hamburg, Germany; Toulouse, France; and Tianjin, China."
Airbus has filed a patent for the world's fastest helicopter - Mashable,"Fri, 20 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vbWFzaGFibGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXItcGF0ZW500gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has filed a patent for the world's fastest helicopter.

The hybrid aircraft is an advanced version of the Airbus' Eurocopter X3, which is currently under development and set an unofficial record in 2013 for the world's fastest helicopter, attaining a top speed of 263 knots — or about 303 miles per hour — in a descent.

That's still much slower than a commercial jet, but for a helicopter, it's greased lightning.

""Airbus' Eurocopter X3 is the fastest helicopter in the world,"" said Deepak Gupta of PatentYogi, which made the above video to demonstrate the patent's ideas.

When pilots want to attain higher speeds, they bring the aircraft to a low pitch, essentially converting the helicopter into a plane. The wings and side propellers take over, providing forward thrust.

Another unique feature of the hybrid helicopter is its absence of a tail rotor. Traditionally, a tail rotor is necessary to keep a helicopter from spinning out of control, but in this design the anti-torque force is provided by the two side propellers.

As with all patents, it remains to be seen whether this mega-fast helicopter ever reaches mass production.

You have what's known as the actual radius versus the effective radius, which is to say, when a long-wheelbased vehicle makes a turn, there comes a point at which the midpoint of the wheelbase is cutting a radius different from the arc that the wheels are describing. This presents a problem if there are vehicles, or guardrails, alongside the vehicle.

In short, it would be impossible for Song's vehicle to navigate the impossibly-tight radii depicted in the video. Take a look, for instance, at these stills:

That will be tricky to execute given the vehicle's width--at seven meters it is nearly three times as wide as your average 2.5-meter-wide articulating bus--but not impossible to accomplish. Indeed, at the Beijing International High-Tech Expo, where Song presented a working scale model earlier this month, he has opted for the latter approach:

EgyptAir operated an aircraft considered among the safest in the industry - USA TODAY,"Thu, 19 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzLzIwMTYvMDUvMTkvZWd5cHRhaXItb3BlcmF0ZWQtYWlyY3JhZnQtY29uc2lkZXJlZC1hbW9uZy1zYWZlc3QtaW5kdXN0cnkvODQ1ODQxOTIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"EgyptAir operated an aircraft considered among the safest in the industry

EgyptAir flight 804 was operated by an airline that meets international safety standards with an aircraft considered one of the safest in the industry.

Egyptian and Greek authorities said said EgyptAir's Airbus A320-232 likely went down near the Greek island of Crete. Egyptian Civil Aviation Minister Sherif Fathi said the possibility of a terror attack as the cause of the crash was “stronger” than technical failure.

The widely flown Airbus A320-232 aircraft has had a relatively small number of accidents, according to a review of destroyed planes conducted by Boeing from 1959 through 2014.

A version of the Airbus A320 was involved in Germanwings flight 9825 crashing into the Alps in March 2015, but that incident was blamed on the pilot intentionally flying into a mountain. Another version of the plane was involved in the EgyptAir hijacking to Cyprus in March, which ended without injuries.

The Airbus A320 family had 0.26 planes destroyed for every million flights, according to the review. And only 0.14 hull losses per million departures involved fatalities, the review found. By comparison, the single-aisle Boeing 737-300, -400 and -500 models had 0.57 destroyed per million flights, according to the review.

More recent models of 737-600, -700, -800 and -900 had 0.23 destroyed for every million flights, the review found.

The popular Airbus A320 family of planes has carried more than 10 billion passengers, according to the manufacturer. A version of the plane takes off or lands every 2 seconds, the manufacturer said. In April, 6,700 versions of the A320 family flew worldwide, the manufacturer said. The planes have flown 98 million flights for 180 million hours.

The missing EgyptAir plane was manufactured in November 2003 and had flown for 48,000 hours, according to Airbus.

Airbus, which is based in Toulouse, France, said in a statement that it would cooperate with French accident investigators who are comparable to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board.

“Our concerns go to all those affected,” the company said. “Airbus will make further factual information available as soon as the details have been confirmed and cleared by the authorities for release.”

EgyptAir has had a troubled history, but passed the International Air Transport Association’s Operational Safety Audit, which is a management benchmark among hundreds of airlines worldwide.

The European Union had cited EgyptAir for safety deficiencies in July 2009, but the airline adopted a corrective action plan and sent monthly reports about corrective actions taken, according to the network, according to the Aviation Safety Network, an industry group that tracks airline incidents."

HAMBURG (Reuters) - Airbus is sticking to 2016 delivery targets despite a slow start caused by supplier problems, but is having to fall back on an older version of its best-selling jet to make up for delays in the A320neo, executives said.

Deliveries fell 7 percent in the first quarter after problems at engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney left about two dozen A320neo jets without engines, creating what its operations chief called on Monday a queue of ""gliders"".

Europe's largest aerospace group said it expected an updated version of Pratt & Whitney's engines to be ready in the summer, allowing it to complete the semi-finished jets and ramp up deliveries in the second half.

But it acknowledged it would have to deliver fewer of the A320neo jets than planned this year, as it brings forward extra deliveries of the existing version, known as 'A320ceo' (current engine option), to plug the gap.

""We are using the flexibility we have on ceos to offset some of our challenges on neos,"" Chief Operating Officer Tom Williams told Reuters on the sidelines of an annual media seminar.

Airbus is targeting over 650 jet deliveries in 2016, up 2.3 percent. The deliveries account for about 70 percent of Airbus Group revenues.

Recent delays have disrupted the outset of a two-year changeover between the current A320 and the revamped A320neo: carried out even as Airbus raises overall narrowbody jet production to 60 a month by mid-2019 from 46 a month now.

Deliveries of the larger A350 long-haul jet have also been delayed, mainly by shortages of cabin equipment.

""2016 is the start of a very challenging period,"" programs chief Didier Evrard said.

Executives said Airbus expected to meet its target of delivering at least 50 A350s in 2016, compared with 9 since January. It plans to raise output to 10 a month by 2018.

More than 40 of the jets are on the assembly line.

""The airframes are there; now it is a race against the clock for the cabins and to finalize assembly,"" Chief Procurement Officer Klaus Richter said.

But with Airbus still dealing with the unexpectedly slow start to the year, operations chief Williams dampened expectations it could raise its output targets even further, as suggested by its bullish sales chief John Leahy.

He told journalists that current plans were ""enough for now"" and there were no serious studies of going higher.

COSTS SHIFTED FROM A380

Leahy has called for more A350s to open the door to increased sales and has suggested the market would support increasing A320 output as high as 63 a month.

Aerospace analysts have, however, expressed concerns that an extended boom in jetliner demand is fading due to concerns over growth in emerging markets and relatively low oil prices.

Williams said there had initially been some problems delivering A350 sections to the assembly line at the right quality, but there had been no repeat of wiring difficulties that crippled output of the larger A380 superjumbo in 2006.

The future of that program remains uncertain as demand for large four-engined jets slows, forcing Airbus to cut production.

Williams said Airbus was cutting A380 costs to maintain it at breakeven partly by redeploying overheads to small jets.

Advertisement

A fourth assembly line for the narrowbody A320neo will use a building in Hamburg previously used for the A380, he told reporters at the German port city's Airbus plant.

He declined to quantify the savings but said they would be ""significant"".

Airbus also set out plans to lower costs and help speed overall production through greater automation, including the use of wearable robotic limbs called exoskeletons and drones inside the factory to check the roof of jets for riveting flaws.

It meanwhile responded to suggestions that Boeing could use an Airbus engine version to boost a weak-selling model.

Reuters reported on Sunday that Boeing was considering modifying a larger 'LEAP' engine used on the A3231neo to enhance its 737 MAX 9 with more capacity and range.

A320 chief Klaus Roewe said the version of engine made for Airbus was available to Boeing but would trigger significant work before it could be placed on the smaller 737 airframe.

Boeing, which disputes Airbus' claims for demand in the 180-seat A321 segment, declined to comment on the engine study.

news by Alasdair Whyte 4 May 2016 Print this page

Airbus Helicopters has said that it will provide its “full support” to the team from the Accident Investigation Board Norway that has been tasked with investigating the crash of one of its EC225 Super Puma helicopters last Friday (29 April) in near Bergen, Norway that killed 13 people.

The aircraft manufacturer has now sent an advisory message to all its customers using the same helicopter model to inspect the suspension bars and fittings on the helicopter main rotor.

The request has been sent under mandatory compliance and advises customers to send the results of the inspection to Airbus.

Airbus has also distanced itself from speculation that the malfunction of the helicopter could be linked to the ditching of similar models in the North Sea 32 miles south west of Shetland in October 2012. In that instance there was a failure of the gearbox lubrication system and a false warning in the emergency lubrication system. In that instance 12 oil rig workers were injured a similar CHC-operated Super Puma EC225 had to be put down in the water.

In a statement the manufacturer said: “Airbus Helicopters welcomes the announcement made by the Accident Investigation Board Norway (AIBN). The investigation will now solely be focused on potential root causes of a technical failure, such as design, production, and/or maintenance. Airbus Helicopters continues to provide its full support to the AIBN investigation.

“At this stage and based on the latest information, preliminary inspection of the main gearbox vertical shaft shows no link with the 2012 ditching events.”"
A Boeing 787 Dreamliner vs. Airbus A350 Showdown Is Looming in the U.S. - Fox Business,"Wed, 18 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL2EtYm9laW5nLTc4Ny1kcmVhbWxpbmVyLXZzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLXNob3dkb3duLWlzLWxvb21pbmctaW4tdGhlLXUtc9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL2EtYm9laW5nLTc4Ny1kcmVhbWxpbmVyLXZzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLXNob3dkb3duLWlzLWxvb21pbmctaW4tdGhlLXUtcy5hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing and Airbus are in the midst of ramping up production of their newest widebody offerings: the 787 Dreamliner for Boeing and the A350 for Airbus.

Both manufacturers accumulated huge order backlogs after launching sales of these new models, as airlines looked to lock in a supply of new, fuel-efficient planes. However, sales of both models have cooled off in recent years. To support their high planned production rates, Boeing and Airbus are counting on a rebound in order volumes within the next few years.

Boeing and Airbus have seen slowing orders for their state-of-the-art widebodies. Image source: Boeing.

This raises the stakes for upcoming widebody fleet replacement decisions at all three U.S. legacy carriers: American Airlines , Delta Air Lines , and United Continental .

Sales slow for Airbus and Boeing

Between 2004 and 2007, Boeing secured 817 net orders for its revolutionary 787 Dreamliner. In the next eight years combined, it accumulated just 325 net orders, with only one year of 100-plus orders and three years with more Dreamliner cancellations than orders.

It's a similar story for the Airbus A350. Airbus recently boasted that it has nearly reached 800 firm orders for its A350 family. What Airbus failed to mention is that it had reached that milestone back in 2013, but has had more cancellations than orders since then.

Neither company is in dire straits right now. Boeing and Airbus have more than 750 unfilled orders for the 787 and A350, respectively: enough to support years of production. Nevertheless, if order rates don't pick up in the next few years, Boeing and Airbus won't be able to go ahead with planned production increases.

U.S. airlines still need more widebodies

American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Continental are each in the early stages of major widebody fleet renewal projects. All three carriers have dozens of widebodies on order.

Despite these bulging order books, American, Delta, and United will likely need to order more widebodies within the next few years. That's largely a consequence of the aircraft order binge that swept the U.S. airline industry in the late 1990s. Planes ordered then will reach retirement age during the 2020s, driving a big replacement cycle.

More Dreamliners for United: A350s too?

United Continental is in the midst of receiving 51 787s from Boeing. (At one point, the order totaled 65 planes, but since early 2015 United has swapped 14 orders for the larger 777-300ER.) Five years ago, United planned to use most of these 787s to replace retiring 767s.

United Airlines is adding lots of Dreamliners to its fleet. Image source: The Motley Fool.

Instead, United has taken advantage of the low fuel price environment to keep its 767s flying. By the end of 2016, United will have received 30 Dreamliners without retiring a single 767.

Nevertheless, United will need to retire these 767s in the next decade or so. The oldest are already 25 years old, while even the youngest are 14 years old. The Boeing 787 is by far the best 767 replacement available, so Boeing has a good chance of getting 30-40 more orders from United over the next few years.

United Continental also has 70 Boeing 777s that were delivered between 1995 and 2002. These planes will start to reach retirement age in five years. Some of United's 787-10 and A350 orders will replace its 777s. Nevertheless, United will probably need to order several dozen more medium-large widebodies to fill this need. The choice between the 787 and the A350 may ultimately come down to pricing.

Delta also needs a 767 replacement

In late 2014, Delta ordered 25 A330-900neos and 25 A350-900s to jump-start its widebody fleet renewal. It also has a long-standing order for Boeing 787s on the books, but it has the right to cancel this order -- and many analysts expect it to do so.

Of the planes it has on order, Delta has earmarked the A330-900neos to replace its aging 767-300ER fleet. Delta has 58 767-300ERs, which are 20 years old, on average. It also has another 21 767-400ERs that are 15 years old, on average.

Delta has been known to keep aircraft in its fleet longer than other U.S. airlines. It has also been opportunistic about buying cheap used airplanes at times to meet its fleet replacement needs.

However, if Delta decides to replace its remaining 767s with new aircraft, Boeing will have the inside track again. The A330-900neo and A350-900 will each hold about 300 seats in Delta's configuration: far more than a Boeing 767. The 787-8 or 787-9 would work better for routes with less demand. Airbus' offering in that segment of the market, the slow-selling A330-800neo, isn't nearly as capable.

American Airlines needs more widebodies, too

Finally, American Airlines has aggressively replaced older aircraft in recent years, but it will still need to order more widebodies a few years down the road. At the end of Q1, American had 49 outstanding orders for Boeing 787s and A350s: enough to replace 23 767s and 9 A330s that will retire between now and 2018 while also supporting some growth and additional replacements in 2019 and 2020.

American Airlines has ordered both the Boeing 787 and the Airbus A350. Image source: Airbus.

American currently plans to keep 17 Boeing 767s beyond 2018. Yet even the youngest of its 767s will be 15 years old by then. American will probably retire these planes by the early 2020s, based on its decision not to extend its new international premium economy class to the 767 fleet.

Additionally, most of American's 47 Boeing 777-200ERs were delivered between 1999 and 2001. These planes will probably be retired in the mid-2020s. The 787-10 and the A350-900 are both good replacement options in this size range. Given that American has outstanding orders for both 787s and A350s, it could go either way.

In the meantime...

American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Continental are likely to wait a few years to see how their fleet needs evolve before placing major follow-on orders for the 787 or A350. This year's big contest between the 787 and the A350 is for a long-awaited order of 50-70 jets from Emirates Airline.

But ultimately, U.S. airlines are likely to need hundreds more planes in the 787 and A350 size classes within the next 10-15 years, assuming relatively modest growth. That will help Boeing and Airbus keep their production lines busy beyond 2020.

"Egyptair flight 804: future black boxes should eject in crash, says Airbus - The Guardian","Tue, 31 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDE2L2p1bi8wMS9lZ3lwdGFpci1mbGlnaHQtODA0LWZ1dHVyZS1ibGFjay1ib3hlcy1zaG91bGQtZWplY3QtaW4tY3Jhc2gtc2F5cy1haXJidXPSAXZodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vd29ybGQvMjAxNi9qdW4vMDEvZWd5cHRhaXItZmxpZ2h0LTgwNC1mdXR1cmUtYmxhY2stYm94ZXMtc2hvdWxkLWVqZWN0LWluLWNyYXNoLXNheXMtYWlyYnVz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The crash of an EgyptAir jet has strengthened the case for ejectable “black boxes” that are launched out of an aircraft in an accident, making them easier to find, the most senior engineer at Airbus has said.



Investigators are searching in some of the deepest waters of the Mediterranean for flight recorders from an EgyptAir Airbus A320, which crashed on 19 May, killing 66 people.

The jet’s flight recorders or “black boxes” are designed to emit acoustic signals for 30 days after a crash, giving search teams less than five weeks to pinpoint the sound in waters up to 3,000 metres deep. Rules that would extend the duration and range of acoustic pingers do not take effect until 2018.

“If we have a deployable recorder it will be much easier to find,” said Charles Champion, the Airbus executive vice-president for engineering.

“We have been working on that and this only reinforces our overall approach.”

Ejectable or “deployable” recorders would separate from the tail during a crash and float in the water while emitting a distress signal.

Recommended by investigators after an Air France A330 jet crashed in 2009, the idea was again discussed after the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight 370 in March 2014.

The United Nations’ aviation agency, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, has called for key data to be recoverable in a “timely manner” from aeroplanes delivered after 2021.

It will be left to airlines and manufacturers to decide how to meet the goal – whether through deployable recorders or other technology such as new homing methods or data streaming.

Deployable recorders have long been used in the military. But some in the industry have expressed doubts about their safe use on civil airliners, saying they could be ejected accidentally and introduce new risks.

Airbus has said in the past it was talking to regulators about adding deployable devices to its two largest models of jets.

Boeing has been more sceptical, citing instances where they have failed on warplanes.

A series of accidents over water including the EgyptAir disaster and wider safety issues are likely to be discussed at a meeting of global airlines in Dublin this week.

Seattle firm designs a showcase for ... Airbus? - GeekWire,"Wed, 04 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlZWt3aXJlLmNvbS8yMDE2L3NlYXR0bGUtZmlybS1jcmVhdGVzLWFlcm9zcGFjZS1zaG93Y2FzZS1haXJidXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Captain Kirk from the original “Star Trek” is celebrating Star Wars Day today, so maybe it shouldn’t be so surprising that a Seattle-based branding and design firm helped create the Airbus Group’s state-of-the-art Experience Center in the nation’s capital.

Hornall Anderson is behind the look of the exhibit space, which takes up about half of the 20,000-square-foot Airbus office space that opened last month on Pennsylvania Avenue. The Experience Center’s videos and interactive displays highlight facets of the Europe-based consortium’s operations in the United States and worldwide.

“You’ll see our Rosetta spacecraft that landed on a comet,” Airbus Group Chairman and CEO Allan McArtor said in a news release. “You’ll see the Perlan II glider that is going to ride wind currents into the stratosphere. You’ll see U.S. Army helicopters that are built in Mississippi, and A320 single-aisle aircraft being built in Alabama.”

A design company based in Seattle may seem an unusual choice for Airbus, considering that the Boeing Co. is building rival 737 jets down the road in Renton. There are Boeing-centric “experience centers” in Renton and other locales. But Airbus decided that Hornall Anderson, which recently did the rebranding for Seattle-based, all-Boeing Alaska Airlines, was the right firm for the job.

“Hornall Anderson created a dynamic experience and storytelling space that enables us to personalize the journey based on who is visiting,” said the Airbus Group’s Rick McGivern. A couple of other Seattle firms contributed to the center’s futuristic look: Avidex Industries and Schema Design.

Airbus channels H.R. Giger for world's first 3D-printed motorcycle - New Atlas,"Fri, 20 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3YXRsYXMuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy11bnZlaWxzLTNkLXByaW50ZWQtbW90b3JjeWNsZS80MzQ1OS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is typically associated with making airplanes, but a subsidiary called APWorks just announced the creation of the world's first 3D-printed motorcycle that can actually be used as a daily rider. Aptly named the Light Rider, given that it weighs in at a mere 35 kg (77 lb), the electric-powered two-wheeler appears to be what would happen if H.R. Geiger designed a motorcycle.

The company said the exoskeleton-like design of the Light Rider came from the need to make the frame structurally able to withstand the loads and stresses of everyday riding. Powered by a 6-kW (8-hp) electric motor with a top speed of 80 km/h (50 mph), it may not be at home on the freeway, but can be used for daily city driving and commuting.

The Light Rider is capable of reaching speeds of up to 80 km/h (50 mph)

The frame of the Light Rider weighs all of 6 kg (13 lb) and is made of a material created and patented by APWorks called Scalmalloy. This is a second-generation aluminum-magnesium-scandium alloy (AlMgS) that the company claims is stronger than the aluminum-silicon powder material used in most production-scale 3D printing today.

The use of Scalmalloy allowed APWorks to create hollow rather than solid frame parts, which made it easier to hide most of the cables and other elements that might be more visible on a standard motorcycle. Bionic algorithms were also used to optimize the entire structure, resulting in a cleaner overall design and a finished bike that weighs 30 percent lighter than other eBikes currently in production.

The Light Rider frame is hollow creating an opportunity to hide cables and other parts

In 2015, TE Connectivity created what was then billed as the first 3D-printed motorcycle, but it was a prototype only, weighed in at around 200 kg (440 lb) and was powered by a 750-W (1-hp) electric motor.

While the Light Rider might be low on weight, the cost to buy one could be considered pretty heavy for the average motorcycle owner. Only 50 will be made, and APWorks is taking pre-orders for a €2,000 (US$2,450) deposit against a €50,000 (US$56,000) final cost. Delivery is expected to take about a year.

APWorks said it would consider creating different styles of motorcycles, like an enduro or motocross bike, before it would venture into mass producing the Light Rider. So anyone lucky enough to afford one of the 50 currently being constructed may be the owner of one very limited edition motorcycle.

The bike is introduced in the video below.

Airbus just patented what could become the fastest helicopter in the world - Yahoo Finance,"Fri, 20 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHA6Ly9maW5hbmNlLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1qdXN0LXBhdGVudGVkLWZhc3Rlc3QtaGVsaWNvcHRlci0xNTQ4NTIzODguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopter H3

Airbus is trying to take high-speed helicopters to a whole new level.

Last month, the US Patent and Trademark Office approved an application from Airbus Helicopters' Axel Fink, Ambrosius Weiss, and Andrew Winkworth for a new compound copter.

The patented design is a yet unnamed development of the company's revolutionary X3 experimental copter that first flew in 2010.

The concept is also part of Airbus Helicopters' — formerly Eurocopter — high speed, long-range, hybrid helicopter (H3) initiative.

During testing, the X3 managed to reach 293 mph, making it the fastest non-tilt-rotor helicopter in the world. The new patent offers a development on the original X3 design.

What makes the new aircraft a compound copter are its pair of wing-mounted engines with pusher propellers in addition to the conventional main rotor. This design eliminates the need for a tail rotor to counter the torque of the main rotor.

A helicopter with additional pusher or puller propellers is far from new, and various versions have been flying for decades. But a copter with this layout and such high performance is novel.

Airbus Helicopters Patent

This design also helps the copter reach the performance levels of tilt-rotor aircraft such as the V22 Osprey that can take off and land like a helicopter but transform into a conventional aircraft for horizontal flight.

Unlike the X3 prototype, the patented aircraft's propellers are mounted behind the wings instead of in front. According to the patent, this helps reduce noise and vibrations while improving lift and passenger safety. The patent authors indicate that further development of the design will include turbojet engines. This means that the patented helicopter will likely be significantly faster than the record-setting X3.

This new patent could also be the latest development of the Low Impact Fast and Efficient Rotor-Craft, or LifeRCraft, to which Airbus Helicopters hinted in 2014. That project is also based on the X3 concept.

Story continues

It is unclear if the patented compound helicopter will ever see production in its current guise.

Airbus Helicopters Foundation has been providing support to on-going humanitarian relief efforts following the earthquake that hit the Manabi and Esmeraldas regions in Ecuador on April 16, 2016.

According to national authorities, this disaster has left more than 20,500 people homeless, and many without water and food supplies. This earthquake is the worst natural disaster that has happened in the country since 1979.

Within 12 hours after the earthquake, Airbus Helicopters Foundation was able to identify a Quito-based H125 helicopter operator Avioandes and immediately put the helicopter at the disposal of the humanitarian agencies on the ground. Airbus Helicopters Foundation and Avioandes joined efforts in order to provide a significant number of flights for Ecuadorian rescue workers, performing a high number of missions in the days following the disaster.

During the first two weeks after the catastrophe, the flexible single-engine aircraft notably helped the Red Cross team with evaluation flights, enabling them to get more precise information about the need for shelter and the number of people in danger or in a precarious situation.

The International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) mobilized humanitarian aids to the affected areas in Ecuador. The H125 also performed flights at the request of the French Foreign Affairs Crisis Centre, acting in the frame of the relief actions implemented through the European Union Emergency Response Coordination Center, and the aircraft’s help was crucial to restoring access to drinking water.

“I would like to warmly thank Airbus Helicopters and Avioandes for providing the helicopters that have played a crucial role in apprehending the overall situation and permitting the joint evaluation with the local authorities on the field” said LCol Denis Lopez, head of the European Union Civil Protection Team during this operational mission in Ecuador.

“In order to perform these rescue operations we used an H125, which is the ideal aircraft for this type of mission,” said Pablo Ochoa, CEO of Avioandes. “Thanks to its maneuverability and its performance we were able to reach all of the affected areas. On behalf of Avioandes and the Ecuadorians, we would like to thank Airbus Helicopters Foundation for its help during this difficult time, as with their assistance we have been able to reduce the impact of this natural disaster.”

In the frame of the Foundation’s support to Ecuador, Airbus Helicopters also provided one heavy H215 helicopter to Manta in order to transport tonnes of first necessity supplies such as food, water and medical equipment and medical staff to otherwise inaccessible areas."
Airbus choppers grounded after deadly crash in Norway - UPI News,"Mon, 02 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy51cGkuY29tL1RvcF9OZXdzL1dvcmxkLU5ld3MvMjAxNi8wNS8wMi9IZWxpY29wdGVyLWdyb3VwLWdyb3VuZHMtQWlyYnVzLWNob3BwZXJzLWluLUF1c3RyYWxpYS1hbWlkLU5vcndheS1jcmFzaC1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9uLzUyNzE0NjIyMTUxMzgv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Helicopter operator Bristow on Monday announced it was grounding several Airbus Super Puma H225 passenger flights in Australia due to concerns of a crash last week that killed 13 people.

HOUSTON, May 2 (UPI) -- A helicopter operator decided Monday to ground some H225 Super Puma choppers in Australia following last week's deadly crash that killed more than a dozen in Norway -- as investigators begin analyzing black box data from the accident. Bristow Helicopters announced the grounding of six passenger choppers in Australia, following similar actions in Norway and the United Kingdom. Advertisement

However, the Super Puma helicopters are still being allowed for emergency operations there, the company said. In Norway and the United Kingdom, though, emergency flights have also been ruled out.

Also Monday, investigators said they have extracted the data from the chopper's ""black boxes"" -- the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder.

""The data is of good quality and is sent back to Norway for analysis,"" the Accident Investigation Board Norway said.

The H225 accident chopper crashed Friday while en route to Norway's Bergen Airport, killing all 13 people aboard. So far, investigators have indicated that it appears the tail rotor separated from the aircraft. The reason is unknown, but officials hope the data from the recorders will give them more clues.

The actions in Norway, United Kingdom and Australia, however, run contrary to the opinion of the chopper's manufacturer, Airbus.

After initially recommending the grounding of all Super Puma helicopters worldwide, the aviation company formerly known as Aérospatiale reversed course Monday and said a precursory examination of the crash site and evidence has led it to believe the crash doesn't indicate a safety-of-flight risk for the Super Puma fleet.

The H225, a staple aircraft in North Sea oil and gas operations, has a history of technical problems. In 2012, two Super Puma choppers crashed due to problems associated with the craft's gearbox. Airbus said Monday the cause of Friday's crash does not appear to involve the gearbox issue, which had been corrected.

The Super Puma H215, a different model, also has a troubled history. Twenty people were killed in the H215 in crashes in 2009 and 2013. The former was also blamed on the aircraft's gearbox."
"Airbus UK to build Europe's Biomass satellite, featuring first use of P-band radar - SpaceNews","Tue, 03 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXJidXMtdWstdG8tYnVpbGQtZXVyb3Blcy1iaW9tYXNzLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS1mZWF0dXJpbmctZmlyc3QtdXNlLW9mLXAtYmFuZC1yYWRhci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS– Airbus Defence and Space UK will build the European Space Agency’s Biomass forest-carbon-monitoring satellite under a contract valued at 229 million euros ($260 million), the two parties announced May 3.

Stevenage, England-based Airbus UK will be prime contractor for the 1,250-kilogram spacecraft, which is expected to launch in 2021, they said.

Biomass’s showcase instrument will be its P-band synthetic-aperture radar antenna, whose main instrument will be built by Airbus’s Friedrichshafen, Germany, facility, with the 12-meter-diameter deployable antenna built by Harris Corp. of Melbourne, Florida.

The 22-nation ESA has budgeted the entire Biomass mission at 420 million euros, a figure that includes the satellite’s construction, launch aboard a European Vega rocket and five years of operations in low Earth orbit.

The mission is designed to observe annual changes in biomass in most of the world’s forests over multiple growth cycles.

Unlike the Sentinel series of Earth observation satellites, Biomass is not part of the European Commission’s multibillion-dollar Copernicus Earth observation program, although Biomass will contribute data to it.

Biomass is all-ESA, and it one of several satellites that ultimately could be used to provide data to global governments committing to the COP21 goals with respect to carbon emissions.

Biomass will be the first space-borne P-band antenna. One of its drawbacks is that P-band, at between 420 and 450 megahertz, is also in use by the U.S. Department of Defense and several of its allies for ground-based missile warning and space surveillance – a system known as the Space Object Tracking Radar network.

Signal overlap between Biomass and these military transmissions will mean Biomass’s coverage will not include North America, Britain, Greenland and Turkey.

ESA had been worried that other regions might deploy radars using in P-band, but that apparently has not happened, and Biomass’s overall value was judged so great as to overcome the fact that it will be blind in these areas.

Alternative radars in X- and C-band, which have been used for many satellite Earth observation missions, do not provide the vertical detail of P-band, ESA concluded. Airbus said the radar, able to peer beneath forest cover, will improve digital elevation maps in forested regions.

Airbus also operates, on a commercial basis, the German TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X X-band radar Earth observation satellites, financed by the German government with Airbus contributions.

The early competition for the Biomass contract was between Airbus and Thales Alenia Space Italy. The Italian government’s decision to reduce its contributions to ESA’s Earth observation program all but took Thales Alenia Space Italy out of the competition. OHB SE of Germany stepped in to compete with Airbus.

Biomass will use Airbus’s AstroBus-Medium satellite frame and the overall program will be with Airbus’s British division. Jo Johnson, Britain’s minister for universities and science, attended the signing ceremony on April 29 in Stevenage, as did Katherine Courtney, the new chief executive of the UK Space Agency.

Signing the contract were Volker Liebig, ESA’s director of Earth observation, and Andrew Sroomer, Airbus’s UK director for Earth observation, navigation and science.

“It is our membership of ESA and our reputation for science and innovation that enables UK industry to win major satellite manufacturing contracts like this one, creating jobs around the country,” Johnson said.

Colin Paynter, managing director for Airbus Defence and Space Ltd., said the contract “is fantastic news for the UK space industry, building on the experience and capabilities of missions such as Sentinel-5 Precursor, Solar Orbiter and Lisa Pathfinder.”

The AstroBus platform has also been used on the Spot 6, Spot 7 and Ingenio optical Earth observation satellites."
RAF's Airbus Tanker at Pax River: Working with the F-35B - Second Line of Defense - Second Line of Defense,"Sat, 21 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vc2xkaW5mby5jb20vMjAxNi8wNS9yYWZzLWFpcmJ1cy10YW5rZXItYXQtcGF4LXJpdmVyLXdvcmtpbmctd2l0aC10aGUtZi0zNWIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"2016-05-21 The F-35 has already worked with the Aussie A330MRTT known as the KC-30A at Edwards.

Now the RAF has flown its Voyager to Pax River to work with the F-35B as well.

Both the F-35 and the KC-30A are being bought and operated by multiple allied air forces, and will bring a fleet perspective to managing and modernizing these twenty-first century air systems.

In an interview with Air Vice-Marshal Gavin Turnbull, Air Commander Australia, the impact of doing so was discussed from the RAAF perspective.

Question: With regard to Australia in your region, you have acquired or are acquiring a number of pieces of equipment, which your neighbors are buying as well, such as KC-30A tankers, F-35s and P-8s. How does common acquisition affect your partnerships in the region as well? Answer: This is a work in progress but flying similar platforms does open the opportunities for more joint work as well, and we have seen this already with regard to KC-30A and P-8. Once we start operating all of the new capabilities in the region, we will start to see a lot more collaboration. This falls into what I call the 80/20 split; you buy a good asset that can give you 80% of what you want; what you can do working with allies and partners is share the experience and the cost to get that additional 20% of capability in collaborative framework.

According to a press release provided by the Joint Program Office on May 20, 2016 concerning the testing going on at Pax with regard to the Voyager and the F-35:

The U.K. Royal Air Force recently deployed a Voyager tanker to U.S. Naval Air Station Patuxent River in support of Lightning II (F-35B) Air-to-Air Refueling trials. The RAF Voyager is a modified Airbus A330-200 that conducts aerial refueling.

The Voyager is scheduled to perform 20 test flights and has successfully completed five to date, with the final flight scheduled by mid-June.

The test trials will include a number of aerial flights to assess both the Voyager’s wing pods and the fuselage refueling unit, which serves as the aircraft’s main refueling point. The test flights will collect data which will result in F-35B refueling certification later this year.

This flight clearance will support U.K. Lightning II Initial Operating Capability (IOC), and the re-location of 617 Squadron to Royal Air Force (RAF) Marham during 2018.

The U.K. has 19 personnel embedded within the F-35 Development Test Program at Patuxent River, many of whom are set to embark on a U.S. Marine Corps amphibious vessel later this year for the third and final set of Development Test Sea Trials for the F-35B, ahead of the U.K.’s own F-35B Ship Integration trials, which are scheduled to take place on board HMS Queen Elizabeth in 2018.

The F-35 will make its U.K. debut this summer at the Royal International Air Tattoo and the Farnborough International Air Show.

According to Airbus Defence and Space:

The A330 MRTT is the only new-generation Multi Role Tanker Transport aircraft fully certified, in operational service and combat proven now.

The A330 MRTT uniquely offers military strategic air transport as well as superior air-to-air refuelling capabilities that have already been extensively proven in numerous real operations by current operators.

With 49 aircraft sold to 7 Major Air Forces (Australia, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Singapore, France and Korea), the A330 MRTT is the preferred tanker/transport solution for current and future needs.

WIKING Helikopter Service GmbH orders two H145s for offshore operations - Airbus,"Tue, 31 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNi0wNS13aWtpbmctaGVsaWtvcHRlci1zZXJ2aWNlLWdtYmgtb3JkZXJzLXR3by1oMTQ1cy1mb3Itb2Zmc2hvcmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Summary

Two H145s for rescue missions, offshore wind and transporting harbour pilots over the North Sea. Offshore version increases payload during winch operations by 200 kg

Berlin – Today, Airbus Helicopters and WIKING Helikopter Service GmbH signed a contract for two H145s in offshore configuration at the international aerospace exhibition ILA in Berlin, making them the first Airbus Helicopters products to be added to their WIKING Helikopter Service GmbH’s fleet. The delivery of the first H145 is scheduled for the end of the year. Both rotorcrafts will be used for the transfer of harbour pilots to ships and service technicians to offshore wind farms as well as for air rescue missions over the North Sea.“We’re glad to have signed the order today. The H145 perfectly meets our requirements regarding operations over the sea“, says Alexander von Plato, director of WIKING Helikopter Service GmbH “At the beginning of this year, during an offshore demonstration we were convinced of the advantages of the new Helionix cockpit of the H145 and its 4-axis autopilot with auto-hover function. Moreover, the machine offers high performance reserves as well as a large interior, and it satisfies our strict safety requirements for the transfer of persons over the sea”, says Holger Stockmeyer, director of WIKING Helikopter Service GmbH.By increasing the engine performance in single-engine operations (Single Engine Hover Performance, two minutes OEI HOGE), the H145 can now bear up to 200 kilograms more payload during winch operations. Thus, the aircraft fulfills the strict regulations for transporting people by winch (HEC - Human External Cargo). Furthermore, the H145 in offshore configuration is equipped with an emergency floatation system, certified for Sea State 6, weather radar, helicopter emergency egress lighting system and an automatic deployable emergency locator transmitter. The H145 in its offshore seating configuration can transport up to eight passengers. The combination of compact external dimensions, a comparatively small rotor diameter and the largest interior in its class make the H145 highly suitable for offshore operations.“The H145 has already proven its reliability with our clients in many missions around the world – during air rescue missions, with the police, with the special forces of the Armed Forces or as a helicopter for VIPs with Mercedes Benz Style design“, explains Wolfgang Schoder, CEO of Airbus Helicopters Germany. “The lowest maintenance costs and acoustic levels, which are almost 50% below the required limit, also contribute to this success”, Schoder continues.WIKING Helikopter Service GmbH focuses on the transfer of sea pilots via helicopters in all weather conditions all year round. The rope winch of the H145 with its adjustable arm and a capacity of 270 kg is perfectly suited for those requirements. The second field of activity of the company includes air rescue operations over the sea, so called Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS), e.g. in wind parks in the German Bight. The aircraft are fitted out with intensive care medical equipment and staffed with one doctor and a rescue assistant. Both the aircraft and the staff are ready to respond to any emergency in an extremely short time.

"China's ""Land Airbus"" will let you drive directly under a bus - Fox News","Fri, 27 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL2F1dG8vY2hpbmFzLWxhbmQtYWlyYnVzLXdpbGwtbGV0LXlvdS1kcml2ZS1kaXJlY3RseS11bmRlci1hLWJ1c9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL2F1dG8vY2hpbmFzLWxhbmQtYWlyYnVzLXdpbGwtbGV0LXlvdS1kcml2ZS1kaXJlY3RseS11bmRlci1hLWJ1cy5hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A new take on mass transit may be headed to China as early as the end of the year: A so-called ""Land Airbus"" system that looks like an overgrown monorail as it motors over existing lanes of traffic.

The big catch: cars can actually drive under the Land Airbus.

For now, the concept only exists as a scale model created by the Shenzen Hashi Future Parking Equipment and as an animated video by Transit Explore Bus. Both Chinese firms intend to work together to deploy a full-size trial version on urban Chinese roads by August of this year, they said this week at an expo in Beijing. The first unit is currently under construction in China.

The Land Airbus moves at about 37 mph, but its real utility lies in its human-carrying capacity: As many as 1,400 people can be squeezed onto a single bus at once. It's also said to be cheaper than trains or tram systems.

In addition, compared to a rail system or a subway, the Land Airbus can be built and deployed much quicker in order to remedy immediate traffic concerns. The Airbus travels on rails mounted to existing roadways and is high enough off the ground for cars to fit under it, but large buses and trucks would be a no-go. However, big trucks are banned from the urban areas of many Chinese cities anyway.

The Land Airbus is meant more for local transit than Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk's proposed Hyperloop system being developed in the United States. The Land Airbus would also require significantly less investment in infrastructure, although it doesn't move nearly as quickly."
GVHL H130 - Airbus,"Sun, 29 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE2LTA1LWd2aGwtaDEzMNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Summary

GVHL operates over India’s vast landscape on heli-pilgrimage and charter operations with its newest star, the H130, in pride of place. Here we take a look at the company’s culture of safety and how it handles high-volume flights to India’s sacred temples.



Its three largest cities exceed 17 million inhabitants each, its topography reaches from Indian Ocean beaches to frozen Himalayan peaks, and its territorial expanse is literally a subcontinent: to fly in India requires intimate knowledge of its unique features, from high and hot conditions to navigating high-density cities.



With over 210,000 accident free flight hours in heli-pilgrimage, charter, aerial survey, oil and gas, and utility services, Global Vectra Helicorp Ltd. (GVHL) is India’s largest private helicopter operator. The company’s areas of operation cover the whole of India, from Katra, Kedarnath and Amarnath in the north, to Barmer and Mumbai in the west, Goa in the south, and Bihar and Vizag in the east.



GVHL counts a fleet of eight aircraft from the Airbus Helicopters line: four H125 are used in passenger transport and aerial work, two H155 for VIP and offshore, an H135 which doubles for VIP and medical support services, and an H130 – with a ninth expected for delivery in the second quarter of this year – used exclusively for heli-pilgrimage work.



“The H130 is proving to be an excellent performer,” says A.J. Baker, CEO of GVHL. “The heli-pilgrimage region is in mountains and valleys at high altitude, so weather changes need to be monitored constantly. Heli-pilgrimage is a high-tempo operation with hundreds of passengers transported each day; managing the loading and unloading process is quite an intense activity.”



The H130 improves upon its EC130 predecessor in elements designed for passenger comfort. Enhancements include a vibration control system, improved air conditioning, a cabin interior with a full flat floor, and new energy-absorbing seats. Its spacious cabin and lightweight body have made it a favorite for use in sightseeing services and shuttle and charter operations around the world.



Baker praises the enclosed Fenestron tail rotor of this newest addition to the fleet as an advantage to safety, while adding that its operational characteristics are a bonus on pilgrimage missions. “The aircraft’s reliability and its smooth ride are positives, especially for our type of operations,” he says. “But one of the highest impact features is the additional passenger seat, which adds great benefit in high-tempo passenger transport activities.”



To ensure greater access to critical support and services, GVHL became the first customer to include a Smart Parts-by-the-Hour HCare support package. “Our H130 is used for intense operations and we wanted the assurance of guaranteed, rapid access to spares and support so that we can maintain optimum aircraft availability,” Baker says. “Being under PBH also ensures a smoother budgeting process, as our scheduled maintenance requirements are fully catered for.”



Having access to local support from Airbus Helicopters’ offices in Mumbai, New Delhi and Bangalore provides the operator with innumerable advantages. “We are seeing clear efforts from the Airbus Helicopters India team to proactively assist us with areas of our business,” Baker says. Early this year, for example, GVHL engaged the manufacturer to deliver ICAO standard Safety Management System (SMS) training. “Our entire safety approach is geared towards adopting best practice for the industry at an international level, along with engaging in a process of continual improvement. We have a sound SMS in place and are expanding our safety and audit training programs across the company, which contributes strongly in promoting our safety culture.”



With its second H130 on the way, the company takes pride in its place on the stage of India’s helicopter operations. “The first flight of our H130 was special,” says Baker. “It was the first of our aircraft operating at Katra in full company colors. It really stands out as the new star on the helipads.”



GVHL an early beneficiary of Airbus Helicopters’ in-situ safety training



Airbus Helicopters International Services (AHIS) offers safety training, among other services, to customer centers and operators worldwide. Early this year, the consulting service received a request – via Airbus Helicopters’ customer center in India – to deliver classes on flight safety and SMS* to operator Global Vectra Helicorp Ltd. (GVHL). Over the course of five days in March, 18 members of management and key departments attended personalized lectures at GVHL’s offices in Mumbai.



Led by AHIS instructor Didier Massat, GVHL’s staff – including CEO A.J. Baker and the company’s senior executives – attended classes designed to raise awareness of safety policy and objectives. The week’s syllabus, based on ICAO** standards, was broken down into more than ten areas, including hazard identification, risk management, mechanism of accident, and a phased approach to SMS implementation. Sharing Airbus Helicopters’ worldwide experience and best practices, Didier Massat led an open discussion session on the final day of classes.



""I would like to submit that the program was excellent and delivered good learning value,” said Capt. Rajiv Kumar, Head of Safety at GVHL. “Didier’s presentation was very good. His mastery of the subject was evident in the way the program was delivered and the way the discussions were guided and managed. His vast experience in the field gave him an advantage, as he could quote examples from within our industry, thereby bringing credibility to the delivery. Didier Massat was an excellent instructor.""



AHIS’s customer-focused services are part of Airbus Helicopters’ larger priority to support flight safety by offering innovative solutions to customers worldwide.

Aircraft pricing – List vs. Market | - AirInsight,"Mon, 16 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vYWlyaW5zaWdodC5jb20vYWlyY3JhZnQtcHJpY2luZy1saXN0LXZzLW1hcmtldC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Care to share?

Aircraft pricing is a touchy subject. Airlines don’t like to discuss it, nor do the OEMs. Nobody pays list prices, and nobody talks about the discount they get either. Indeed, as we have heard at ISTAT – if you want to know transaction prices, take the list price and divide by two, and go from there.

It turns out that formula is close to the truth. We took a look at a selection of aircraft and compared the list price to market values, using data from Collateral Verifications. Take a look at the table. We placed the aircraft in order from largest discount to lowest discount from list prices.

There are some surprises.

Who would have thought the SSJ would have the lowest discount? Being built in Russia, one might have expected a bigger discount.

The Embraer aircraft are also near the bottom of the list. This is impressive and says a lot about how the market views and values the aircraft. The E-Jet is clearly highly regarded.

The A380 is also a surprise – given slow sales one would have expected a deeper discount. Perhaps Emirates gets this, but it is not reflected in the market value. If Emirates is getting a deeper discount, they should keep buying them.

The 787s are going at less than 50% off list. Given the recent commentary about Boeing never being able to recover from the 787, one might want to reconsider. Demand exists, especially for the -9. It prices well for Boeing, especially when you look at the Airbus competitor. Some customers are willing to pay a relative premium for the aircraft.

The CRJ1000 is trading soft compared the CRJ900. This reflects slow demand for the CRJ1000 and better demand for the CRJ900. Too bad US regional airlines cannot deploy the CRJ1000 as it could be a better deal since its market price per seat is 21% lower, and it offers 5.5% better economics.

Comparing the 777-300ER and A350-900; the Airbus looks to be a much better deal. Except you can’t get one in a hurry, but Boeing will get you a 777-300ER much quicker.

The 737-800 and A320 are priced closely; the A320 is 2% more expensive at list price but 4.7% cheaper at market price. Yet on a per seat basis, using market prices, the 737-800 trades at a 3% discount over the A320.

Of interest is the pricing for A320ceo and neo. Airbus wants a 9% list premium for neo, and market values are 9% higher for neo. Airbus appears to have priced the neo right on target.

Comparing the A321 and 737-900ER, the A321 lists 13% higher, and is 9% pricier at market. This reflects Airbus ability to outsell the 737-900ER and demand a premium over the Boeing.

Finally, the three most discounted aircraft are from Airbus. The A319 is no surprise. But seeing the A330s is interesting. Since these aircraft compete with the 787s, we can see how the market values them. The A330s trade at about 60% discount whereas the 787s are under 50% discount. The A330-200 has 7% more seats than the 787-8, but market value per seat on the Airbus is 31% lower. For the A330-300 has 3% more seats than the 787-9, with market value per seat 25% lower than the 787-9. One can take two views here. First Airbus is able to cut prices and disrupt Boeing’s 787 in the market. This is what Airbus has told us. Alternatively, Boeing has an airplane that is 20% or more efficient and therefore Airbus has to discount that much to reach a point of economic indifference.

Aircraft pricing is fascinating because every campaign is a fresh battle in the war of selling aircraft to airlines and lessors. There are no apples to apples comparisons. Every deal is different and has nuances that move prices. But using these numbers one gets a sense of where the boundaries are and what the people involved with the business are doing to accomplish their jobs."

Airbus Helicopters presents an exclusive first glimpse of the H160 VIP version at this year’s EBACE meeting in Geneva, held from May 24 to 26. Customers will have the opportunity to experience some of its features like its exclusive cabin interior, electrical footstep and hinged doors thanks to a virtual reality immersion tool.

“After the unveiling at Heli-Expo in 2015, the H160 has generated a lot of interest from operators on this strategic segment due to its unrivalled combination of innovation, design and performance,” said Bernard Fujarski, senior vice president and head of the H160 program at Airbus Helicopters. “Since the recent launch of the commercialization at Heli-Expo this year, we have already signed some letters of intent [LOI] for the H160. With EBACE marking the unveiling of the H160 in its VIP version, we expect to sign additional LOI with private and corporate customers.”

Airbus Helicopters launched a design contest in October 2015 with five designers competing to create the H160 VIP cabin interior.

Airbus Helicopters’ in-house design team will work closely with Pegasus Design to establish a new standard of VIP cabin interiors on the private and business aviation market. Airbus Helicopters Press Release

“After evaluation from a large panel of customers and specialists in luxury goods, Pegasus Design style intention has been selected,” said Frederic Lemos, head of private and business aviation. “Our in-house design team will now work closely with Pegasus Design to establish a new standard of VIP cabin interiors on the private and business aviation market, ensuring that the H160 will propose the same level of excellence, innovation, and emotion inside and out.”

The H160 development continues to progress as the two prototypes in flight testing have logged around 140 hours with the second prototype (PT2) having performed the 100th flight mid-May. PT2 has been flying with Turbomeca’s Arrano engines since January 2016 and PT1, whose retrofit is being finalized, will be flying with the Arrano engines in the next couple of days.

The flight envelope is continuously being expanded and PT2 has reached a maximum altitude of 20,000 feet and has performed turns at 2.2G confirming expected behavior of the rotor and dampers. The upcoming milestones in the flight test campaign are the climatic campaigns, continued performance testing of the Arrano engines and finalization of aeromechanical configuration of H160.

With the most extensive range of helicopters dedicated to the private and business aviation Airbus Helicopters is the unrivalled market leader with 33 percent of the fleet currently in service."
Airbus Helicopters to reveal X3 successor plan | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Wed, 25 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLXRvLXJldmVhbC14My1zdWNjZXNzb3ItcGxhbi8xMjA3MTguYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters will reveal at next week’s ILA Berlin air show its initial concept for a 220kt (410km/h)-cruise helicopter developed under the EU-backed Clean Sky 2 effort.

A preliminary design review was scheduled for the programme in late 2015, according to documents associated with the research.

The airframer launched its involvement in the high-speed rotorcraft project at the 2014 Farnborough air show under the LifeRCraft (low-impact, fast and efficient rotorcraft) banner. It is envisaged as a successor to its record-breaking X3 high-speed demonstrator, which last flew in 2013 having achieved speeds of 255kt in level flight.

Airbus Helicopters

According to the details of a stakeholder presentation in March, overall responsibility for the development will be split between various parts of the Airbus Helicopters operation, with its site in Donauwörth, Germany in charge of the main fuselage and wings. Rotors – main and lateral – will be handled by its Le Bourget, France blade facility, and the tail boom and its control surfaces prepared by its factory in Albacete, Spain.

However project management, integration and ground- and flight-test activities will be carried out at the company’s headquarters in Marignane, France, the document indicates.

That workshare appears to conform to the airframer’s new industrial model – unveiled in March – which divides sub-assembly activities across its four main plants.

Three sub-projects have been allocated €3.25 million ($3.62 million) under the most recent round of EC proposals. These include two work packages headed by Airbus Helicopters Deutschland, which will develop the canopy structure and engine compartments – comprising the cowlings, exhaust ejector and air intakes – for the demonstrator aircraft. GE Aviation-owned Avio Aero, meanwhile, will lead an effort to “define an advanced health monitoring system” for the lateral gearboxes and main gearbox reduction stages.

The document indicates Romania’s INCAS aerospace research agency is responsible for leading manufacturing work on the fuselage, which should be an “advanced composite or hybrid metallic/composite structure”.

Separately, Airbus Helicopters Deutschland appears to have been quietly working on designs for a future compound rotorcraft, according to newly-released patent documents.

Filed in July 2013 and granted by the US Patent Office on 26 April, the submission covers a number of configurations. All feature a joined or box-wing design on the side of the aircraft – a main lower wing including ailerons and a secondary upper wing – and pusher propellers. Driveshafts from the main engine are contained within the upper wing.

Possible alternatives include the main engines being located at the wing-join point and the addition of nose-mounted canards to increase lift, enabling the main wing and propellers to be moved rearwards.

Aft-located engines, particularly in a pusher configuration, appear the favoured approach as they cut noise, improve cabin safety in the event of a blade loss, and “keep the boarding area free of rotating devices”, says the patent application.

Airbus' Light Rider is The First 3D Printed Motorcycle - CarScoops,"Fri, 27 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnNjb29wcy5jb20vMjAxNi8wNS9haXJidXMtbGlnaHQtcmlkZXItaXMtZmlyc3QtMy1waW50ZWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What happens when an aerospace-specialist develops a motorcycle instead of calculating spaceship-engines? A unique concept is born.



This peculiar looking thing is called the Light Rider, and it’s the world’s first 3D printed motorcycle. With a state-of-the-art 3D frame, APWorks – one of Airbus’ subsidiaries – used bionic algorithms in order to define the organic frame structre using nature’s design principles.

In other words, it has an aero-space approved approach, created out of thousands of 30 µm thin layers in a metallic powder bed, that offers the bike superb stiffness. APWorks says it’s using the best materials as the whole frame is created out of Scalmalloy – an aircraft-grade aluminum that offers the specific strength of titanium and is unequaled in 3D printing.

The entire rig also weighs only 35 kg (77 lbs), which in conjunction with its emission-free 6 kW electric motor that outputs up to 130 Nm of torque, offers a power-to-weight ratio equal to that of a supercar. It does 0 to 45 (28 mph) km/h in 3 seconds and has a top speed of 80 km/h (50 mph), with a driving range of 60 km (37 miles).

“We have used our know how of optimization and manufacturing, to create means of transportation, that match our expectations”, explains APWorks’s Niels Grafen: Exceptionally strong, impressively lightweight and of the highest quality.

Airbus’ APWorks plans to make an exclusive small series of the Light Rider – street legal for everyday use – with only 50 units planed. A deposit of €2000 ($2,229) will secure you one, but the full price of the bike is €50.000 ($55,727).

Some key facts about it:

—Similar to the Boeing 737, the single-aisle, twin-engine jet is used to connect cities that are between one and five hours apart.

—The Airbus A320 is generally considered one of the safest passenger planes in service. A Boeing safety analysis in early 2015 said the A320 registered just 0.14 fatal accidents per million takeoffs.

—The first A320 entered service in 1988.

—There are nearly 4,000 A320s in operation worldwide.

—Airbus, a European plane-making group based in Toulouse, France, also makes nearly identical versions of the A320: the smaller A318 and A319 and the stretched A321. The entire fleet has accumulated nearly 180 million flight hours in over 98 million flights.

—The plane is certified to fly up to 39,000 feet, its maximum altitude before its rate of climb begins to erode. The plane has an absolute flight limit of 42,000 feet."

The helicopters, AS 332 Super Pumas and AS 350 Ecureils, both produced by the company Airbus Helicopters, were shown in a promotional video about the Uzbekistan armed forces posted in February but just noticed recently by the Russian military blog BMPD. (The video is below, and the helicopters are shown starting at about 2:00.)







In 2014, an Airbus executive said that a deal to sell 14 military helicopters to Uzbekistan was being held up because Germany, which produces parts for the helicopter, was refusing to allow the export due to concerns about human rights and the rule of law in Uzbekistan. Exactly what helicopters were under consideration was not made public, so it's not clear that this is the same deal, and if so, what changed between 2014 and now. ""Airbus Helicopters is not at liberty to discuss about contractual commitments it may or may not have with Uzbekistan,"" a company spokesman told The Bug Pit in an emailed response to questions.







Both the AS 332 and AS350 are transport helicopters, and in the video, Uzbekistan soldiers are shown rappelling out of the AS350 on to a rooftop and filing out, with weapons drawn, of the AS 332, suggesting that Uzbekistan sees these as means for deploying small groups of soldiers into combat.







This would be the second recent acquisition of European military aircraft by Uzbekistan: last summer, Airbus C295W transport airplanes were spotted painted in Uzbekistan livery. Also in that case, Airbus declined to comment. The European Union imposed an arms embargo on Uzbekistan in 2005 in response to the massacre of protesters in the city of Andijan, but those sanctions were lifted in 2009.

MARIGNANE, France, May 12 (UPI) -- Airbus Helicopters is upgrading the avionics suite aboard EC145 helicopters used for search-and-rescue and medical evacuations missions in France. The contract for the upgrade to 35 helicopters of the Interior Ministry's Sécurité Civile agency was issued by the French military procurement agency DGA. Advertisement

""We are very proud of the trust that the Sécurité Civile has placed in our support and services with this second contract in less than a year,"" said Matthieu Louvot, Airbus Helicopters executive vice president of Customer Support and Services. ""It is a great honor for us to be confirmed as the industrial partner of choice by this reference EC145 operator to which we are also providing a comprehensive, nose-to-tail global service solution.""

Airbus Helicopters was contracted last year for service support for Sécurité Civile and Gendarmerie Nationale's EC145 fleet.

Under the new seven-year award, the company will conduct mechanical and electrical modifications to integrate functions such as LPV/SBAS guidance, digital maps, and GPS installations.

""This retrofit program ensures that our EC145s will remain capable of meeting the most demanding operational requirements with the highest levels of safety"", said Victor Devouge, head of aviation means for the Sécurité Civile. ""This fleet is now enjoying an availability rate of around 95 percent, which is absolutely essential in allowing us to perform our daily operations."""
Review: JetBlue Airbus A321 — Las Vegas to New York - The Points Guy,"Mon, 30 May 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS8yMDE2LzA1L2pldGJsdWUtYWlyYnVzLWEzMjEtcmV2aWV3LWxhcy1qZmsv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Update: Some offers mentioned below are no longer available.

Earlier this month , TPG Editorial Intern Nick Ellis traveled to Las Vegas and got a chance to fly home on JetBlue's new Airbus A321 during a red-eye flight back to New York (JFK). Read on for his impressions.

I recently returned from an incredible trip to Sin City with Editor-in-Chief Zach Honig and TPG Associate Editor Emily McNutt, where we attended Vegas Uncork'd, an event which offered special perks to Chase Sapphire Preferred Card cardholders. In an effort to diversify our review opportunities, the three of us took three different flights and stayed at three different hotels — so keep an eye out for some new Las Vegas hotel reviews over the next few weeks! I chose to fly home from Las Vegas (LAS) to New York (JFK) on JetBlue's new Airbus A321. Read on to see how it went.

Booking

I booked the round-trip flight and hotel together to save about $330.

I booked this flight using an Amex Platinum Card as part of an Air + Hotel package through American Express Travel, paying full price for my round-trip JetBlue flight at $533.41 and a discounted rate of $739.29 (excluding a $35.84 daily resort fee) at the Palazzo Las Vegas, as part of the package. The grand total, including the round-trip flight and four nights at The Palazzo was $1,272.70. Had I not taken advantage of the bundled flight and hotel reservation, the hotel alone would have cost me a total of $1,070.72, excluding the mandatory resort fee.

Arrival and Check-In

Our Uber driver dropped us off right at the curb at Terminal 3.

After experiencing a complicated airport pickup process upon arrival in Las Vegas, the drop-off process was a relative breeze. My Uber driver was able to drop us off at the curb at Terminal 3, where my JetBlue flight would be departing from.

As this was a red-eye flight back to New York, the lines at the check-in counter were practically nonexistent. I was asked to gate check my 'oversized carry-on' bag at JFK, so I figured I would drop off my bag at the baggage drop this time around since there were so few people in line. If I'd had the JetBlue Plus Card, I could have avoided the $25 checked bag fee altogether, but I ended up paying for the checked bag with my Ritz-Carlton Rewards Credit Card and will get the fee reimbursed as part of the card's $300 annual travel credit.

After dropping off my bag, I made my way over to the security line, which seemed unreasonably long considering how few people were actually in the airport. Since TPG Associate Editor Emily McNutt recently gained Gold Status on Virgin America through a status match, I followed her to the first-class security line, which was very short — it frankly didn't appear as if anyone was checking to make sure everyone in line was truly supposed to be there. The first-class security line took just a few minutes and soon we were on our way to the Centurion Lounge in Terminal 1.

The Lounge

I was excited to experience the Centurion Lounge at LAS.

I was eager to get to the lounge, as this was my first experience in a Centurion Lounge. Since TPG Editor-in-Chief Zach Honig is an American Express Platinum cardholder, he was allowed to bring two guests into the lounge, which worked perfectly for our group of three. We took the underground tram from the E to D concourse and headed straight for the Centurion Lounge.

Upon entering, I noticed that it seemed to be more crowded than I would've expected for a Sunday evening, but we easily found a table that had outlets for charging our phones and laptops. The lounge itself felt plenty spacious, with tables to work at and eat on as well as large leather chairs for relaxing before your flight.

The extensive salad bar in the Centurion Lounge at LAS.

I sampled several of the food options, including a chicken cacciatore dish and a salad I put together at the self-serve salad bar. The servers were attentive and came around often to remove plates as well as to replenish the food at the counter. There was also a fully stocked bar that had an impressive craft cocktail list.

Boarding

Boarding began just a few minutes late for my 9:50pm departure. The gate agents first called for passengers needing special assistance to board, followed by Mosaic members. I got to board fairly early since I was seated in row 25 and they boarded the aircraft from back to front. Boarding was completed a few minutes behind schedule and we pushed back from the gate just around 10:00pm.

The Seats

My regular economy seat featured 33 inches of pitch.

The 3-3 arrangement on this Airbus A321 allows for 18-inch-wide seats, with 33 inches of pitch in regular economy seats, and anywhere from 37-41 inches of pitch in the Even More Space seats. I found my economy seat to be really roomy for me at 5'10"", however, it would have been nice to have several extra inches to stretch out during the long flight home. The seat itself is a ""slimline"" design but I found it to be comfortable and appreciated that the headrest came with adjustable side cushions, making sleeping a bit more cozy.

An eye mask and a pair of earplugs were included in JetBlue's ""Snooze Kit.""

I was pleasantly surprised to find a ""Snooze Kit"" lying on my seat, 25D, that contained an eye mask as well as a set of ear plugs. This was a nice touch that is fairly uncommon for domestic flights and I found the mask to be helpful in allowing me to sleep, even with numerous bright screens around me.

A peek at the unusual jump seat in row 22 (exit row).

Something I hadn't seen before was the style of jump seat used in this aircraft. It was located in row 22, an exit row, just a few rows up from my seat, and had plastic casing that went all the way to the floor, which could potentially impede the legroom of the person sitting behind it in row 23. The cabin was also fitted with cool blue lighting that I found to be very relaxing for a nighttime flight.

In-Flight Entertainment

The new 10.1"" entertainment screen was full of options to pass the time on the long flight back to JFK.

I was very excited to learn that this flight was going to be operated by JetBlue's new A321 because it comes equipped with the carrier's latest in-flight entertainment. I thoroughly enjoyed the 10.1"" entertainment screen found in the seat-back in front of me. It offered 100+ channels of live TV delivered through DirecTV, several feature films, SiriusXM radio, a map channel and finally an app called ""The JetBlue Experience"" that provided access to on-screen magazines and other special features.

I was able to watch live TV before falling asleep.

JetBlue offers live TV provided by DirecTV, and I was eager to try out this feature that so many speak so highly of. Since this flight departed so late, there wasn't a ton of content that appealed to me, so I settled on reruns of CBS' Blue Bloods. I was able to get through about an episode and a half before sleeping (albeit not that well) for the rest of the flight.

The remote built into the armrest was an annoyance during the flight.

One major annoyance was the placement of a remote control toward the back of the arm rest, almost exactly where my elbows were resting. Throughout the flight I woke up because I had accidentally turned the brightness up all the way on my screen, and had accidentally changed the channel or volume of my neighbor's screen, which made for some awkward interactions.

Bottom Line

The new seats on this A321 were really roomy for the four-hour flight from LAS to JFK.

Since this flight was at night and I slept almost the whole time, I didn't have any food. The crew did make its way through the cabin several times, offering mini water bottles (of which I took a few) and unlimited snacks, which is a welcome change from other domestic airlines. The crew were all very polite and attentive, happy to help passengers with any request.

I'd say that my first experience with JetBlue was a success. The comfortable and spacious seats, extensive in-flight entertainment options and pleasant crew made this a very good flight — despite it being a dreaded domestic red-eye trip — and I'm already looking forward to my next flight.
