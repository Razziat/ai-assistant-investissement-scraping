Chips are finally up for India | Mint - Mint,"Thu, 26 Sep 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9JbmR1c3RyeS9ydUJPVFVFSGlrenRwaFUxV3hVc0VOL0NoaXBzLWFyZS1maW5hbGx5LXVwLWZvci1JbmRpYS5odG1s0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGl2ZW1pbnQuY29tL0luZHVzdHJ5L3J1Qk9UVUVIaWt6dHBoVTFXeFVzRU4vQ2hpcHMtYXJlLWZpbmFsbHktdXAtZm9yLUluZGlhLmh0bWw_ZmFjZXQ9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Mumbai: The proposal had been in the works for years until it was stalled by the global credit crisis that followed US investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. ’s collapse in September 2008.

When everyone thought it had been abandoned, the Indian government brought it out of the mothballs on 12 September, dusted it up and renewed the country’s quest to become a hub of semiconductor manufacturing.

The government approved, in principle, a proposal to build two semiconductor manufacturing facilities to check India’s dependence on imports of electronic products, especially microchips. Each of the plants, it is expected, will require an investment of ₹ 25,000 crore, provide direct employment to around 22,000 people, and indirect employment to 100,000.

The plan, if successful, will create the first semiconductor manufacturing plants, or fabs (short for fabrication units), in a country that has at least 100 companies, including the subsidiaries of multinational chip makers, that excel in chip design.

And it will fulfil India’s almost decade-old ambition—of making chips (long the subject of a nationalistic aphorism about the country needing foreigners to invest in making microchips, not potato chips). Apart from boosting India’s manufacturing credentials, it will substantially reduce the country’s import bill.

At 6.3% of overall imports and almost 2% of India’s gross domestic product (GDP), electronics imports contribute significantly to the country’s trade imbalance, said a 16 September report by research firm Frost and Sullivan.

“If similar conditions prevail, there is ample evidence to suggest that electronics import will even surpass our crude import bill by 2025,"" the report added. Currently, India imports $33 billion of electronic goods, behind only oil and gold. It consumes $7 billion of semiconductor products every year—a figure that’s expected to rise to $55 billion by 2020. A wafer fab in India, experts say, could help it attain a degree of self-sufficiency in electronics, besides putting the country on the semiconductor manufacturing map along with the US, Taiwan, China, South Korea, Singapore and Japan.

If India’s plans, first articulated in the mid-2000s, haven’t succeeded, blame it on infrastructural bottlenecks, the absence of strong enough incentives to make setting up fabs in the country attractive to foreign investors, and, finally, the global financial meltdown of 2008-09 that made investments hard to come by.

In November 2005, SemIndia Inc., a consortium of overseas Indians, announced plans to invest $3 billion in a chip manufacturing factory in Andhra Pradesh.

It was part of the state’s ambitiously named Fab City, and US chip-maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) was to pick up a stake in the project and transfer microprocessor and logic manufacturing technology to SemIndia.

Around the same time, media reports speculated that Intel Inc., the world’s largest chip manufacturer, was toying with the idea of setting up a wafer fab in India, but was waiting for the country’s semiconductor policy to take shape.

In the meantime, Intel selected Vietnam for a facility, and later set up another in China. To be fair, Intel never made any public announcement in this context.

In 2007, Hindustan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (HSMC) submitted a similar proposal to set up a $4 billion semiconductor unit. It partnered with Infineon Technologies AG, Europe’s second biggest chipmaker, which was to license its technology. Hindustan Semiconductor, at the time, said it planned to start production within two years.

Had any of these projects seen the light of day, India would have been a semiconductor force to reckon with. But that was not to be.

By February 2008, SemIndia began hinting at a delay in the project and by November 2009, top executives of the SemIndia Group, including chairman Vinod K. Agarwal, Ajay Marathe—who had quit as AMD India’s managing director to take up the post of chief operating officer at SemIndia—and managing director B.V. Naidu, had all left the company.

Hindustan Semiconductor’s proposal, too, went into cold storage—and with it, the hopes of India becoming a chip manufacturing base.

In 2011, the government resurrected the idea and set up a committee to identify technology and investors, and to recommend incentives to set up two fabs in the country. The passing of the National Electronics Policy 2012, intended to promote manufacture of electronic goods in India, only helped its cause.

The government-appointed committee, meanwhile, submitted its recommendations in March, but these met with opposition from the Planning Commission that was reportedly against giving a large-scale subsidy that could increase the widening fiscal deficit. But the central government prevailed.

The 12 September announcement has energized Devendra Verma, chief executive and founder of Hindustan Semiconductor. “I have not lost hope despite waiting for almost seven years to build the fab in India. We have an excellent Silicon Valley team in place and the right manpower. We would have almost succeeded to set up a fab in 2008, had it not been for the Lehman crisis that resulted in a global financial meltdown,"" Verma said in a telephone interview from the US last week.

Hindustan Semiconductor’s consortium includes French-Italian electronics and semiconductor manufacturer STMicroelectronics (STM), and Malaysia-based wafer manufacturer Silterra. It has proposed to invest ₹ 25,250 crore to set up a fab facility in Prantij, near Gandhinagar in Gujarat.

“STM has a big portfolio of products that sell in India. Hence, we chose the company. Similar is the case with Silterra and both of them have worked closely, so it made sense to have a partnership with both,"" said Verma. Verma’s plans, however, await final approval from the government, which, industry analysts, say remains a formality. In anticipation of imminent approval, his company has also signed agreements with infrastructure companies Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T) and Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS).

“We will set up a greenfield project for which we will require 30-odd permits from different departments. It’s not our expertise. Hence, we roped in L&T and IL&FS to help us build the fab city on the lines of China, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia,"" said Verma.

An L&T spokesperson declined to comment for the story.

Typically, companies such as L&T pick up a small equity stake, eyeing a bigger construction and engineering share of the business. A senior IL&FS executive, who did not want to be named, said the company had only an advisory role at this point of time and no financial commitment.

“We will be helping HSMC (Hindustan Semiconductor) to design and plan the infrastructure to set up a fab. We will be helping the company to structure the project in the country as we have the expertise to do so,"" he added, without disclosing details.

A fab also requires around 10 million gallons of water a day and gases such as nitrogen, for which Hindustan Semiconductor will take advantage of the existing partnerships it has with US Filters, a former Siemens affiliate, for water and waste management and France’s Air Liquide for gases.

Hindustan Semiconductor’s proposed fab will have the capacity to churn out 40,000 wafer starts per month of 300 mm (wafer) size, using advanced CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) technology. “We may do 90 nanometres (nm), 65 nm and 45 nm in the first phase and 45 nm, 28 nm and 22 nm nodes in the second phase,"" said Verma.

A nanometre, which is one-billionth of a metre, measures the size of transistors in a chip. Smaller transistors cut costs and increase efficiency. Silicon wafers are thin slices of semiconductor material, made available in a variety of diameters from 25.4 mm (1 inch) to 300 mm (11.8 inches), and fabs are defined by diameter of wafers they are tooled to produce. A bigger wafer reduces the cost of manufacturing since more chips can get packed onto a single wafer.

Companies such as Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd are each conducting research on a 450 mm prototype.

Apart from Hindustan Semiconductor, a consortium comprising Jaiprakash Associates Ltd, International Business Machines Corp. and Israel-based TowerJazz, has also proposed setting up a ₹ 26,300 crore fab in Greater Noida, on the outskirts of New Delhi. The plant will have a capacity of 40,000 wafer starts per month of 300 mm size, using advanced CMOS technology. Technology nodes proposed are 90, 65 and 45 nm in the first phase and a 28 nm node in the second phase with the option of establishing a 22 nm node in the third phase.

The industry has long argued that India will need its own fabrication industry to create a full semiconductor ecosystem.

The government’s decision to set up fabs in India will prove to be a “game changer"", according to India Electronics and Semiconductor Association (IESA).

“With the location of a fab in India, the country could achieve a degree of self-sufficiency in electronics, and partially reduce the very high supply chain risks that India is exposed to, without an alternative source for procurement,"" said P.V.G. Menon, president of IESA.

The move will also help system designers, software developers and chip designers to join hands and develop innovative, indigenous and cutting-edge technology products, said Menon.

The Manufacturers’ Association for Information Technology (MAIT), a lobby body for hardware companies in the country, also praised the decision. “Considering the fact that the IT hardware industry is highly dependent on imports, homegrown chip companies would help strengthen the electronics ecosystem in the country,"" said Anwar Shirpurwala, executive director, MAIT. He added the decision would promote manufacturing of indigenously-designed and manufactured chips and help the country reduce dependence on imports. “It will also help existing IT hardware manufacturers to obtain essential IT components at a much lower cost,"" said Shirpurwala.

He cited a task force report which forecast the demand for electronics hardware in the country to touch $400 billion by 2020.

“Setting up of such a high value manufacturing industry as semiconductor chip fabrication will have truly transformative effect on the overall electronics industry. This will have a very strong multiplier effect that will result in major strides forward in the value generated from all sectors within the semiconductor ecosystem. While we eagerly await the formal news of the cabinet approval via the appropriate government sources, the historic significance of this approval will be felt for many years to come. Manufacturing in India will soon witness a new frontier,"" said Aninda Moitra, president and managing director of Applied Materials India.

But there’s a problem.

A 90 nm process refers to the level of CMOS process technology that was reached in 2004-05, with 22 nm being the current technology. By the time the fab is ready, the world’s best fabs would have reached 14 nm and 10 nm levels.

Where does that leave the planned Indian fabs that plan to make 22 nm wafers only in their second phase? According to Menon, the products churned out by Indian fabs will include chips for industrial use such as those in energy meters, inverters; in auto electronics for chips in ignition and instrumentation panels of bikes; as also processors for low-end tablets like the Aakash.

Ajai Chowdhry, co-founder, HCL, also believes that the fabs will not only bring in much-needed investment but also help in strengthening the EDSM (electronic system design and manufacturing) ecosystem and provide chips for set-top boxes, smart energy meters, micro-ATMs (automated teller machines) and smartcards, among other things. Chowdhry added that sectors such as defence, space and homeland security “have strategic needs"", which can be met by home-grown wafer fabs.

But incentives need to be adequate for India to be able to compete with China, Ireland, Israel and Malaysia to attract semiconductor makers.

Last July, the cabinet had approved ₹ 10,000 crore of incentives for manufacturing electronics products and components under the Modified Special Incentive Package Scheme (M-SIPS), wherein companies that invest in special economic zones (SEZs) will get 20% subsidy on capital expenditure, while those operating out of SEZs will get 25%.

Companies that have proposed to set up fabs will get the incentives under M-SIPS, along with some additional benefits.

IESA’s Menon points out that some of the world’s leading economies including the US, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan and China, besides a number of developing economies like Malaysia and Israel, have their own fabs that contribute significantly to the growth and development of the economy of their respective countries and “we hope that this would be the case in India as well"".

Meanwhile, the government has sweetened the fab deal with its package for the two consortia, including incentives available under M-SIPS and deduction for expenditure on research and development under the Income Tax Act.

In addition, fab facilities will also be eligible for investment-linked deduction under Section 35AD of the Income Tax Act.

The government will also provide viability-gap funding—a financial grant to make the project commercially viable—in the form of an interest free loan for 10 years. The government, which will get 11% equity in the proposed projects, requires the technology providers to take at least 10% equity.

The details of the incentives are yet to be worked out.

The pieces are falling in place.

For India, it’s a question of now or never, as it looks to attain a long-cherished ambition.

La Harley refroidie par liquide | La Presse - La Presse,"Wed, 11 Sep 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhcHJlc3NlLmNhL2F1dG8vbW90by8yMDEzMDkvMTAvMDEtNDY4Nzk5Mi1sYS1oYXJsZXktcmVmcm9pZGllLXBhci1saXF1aWRlLnBocNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Après de multiples décennies à produire de gros V-Twin refroidis par air, le constructeur de Milwaukee se lance finalement dans «l'ère liquide» en introduisant une Electra Glide équipée d'une paire de radiateurs.

Lorsqu'on entre dans l'univers des montures de nature classique, la réticence des amateurs au changement est parfois farouche. Combinez cette résistance à la nature ultraconservatrice des fidèles de la marque Harley-Davidson et vous obtenez un véritable mur antiprogrès. Exagéré, l'énoncé? Vérifiez vous-même auprès de ces fanatiques.

Bertrand Gahel LA PRESSE

Demandez-leur par exemple s'ils accueilleraient un système de refroidissement par liquide moderne en lieu et place du traditionnel refroidissement par air de leur Harley chérie. Mais ne vous étonnez pas si la question est interprétée comme une insulte...

Or, pour 2014, c'est exactement ce qui se passe. Après de multiples décennies à produire de gros V-Twin refroidis par air, le constructeur de Milwaukee se lance finalement dans «l'ère liquide» en introduisant une Electra Glide équipée d'une paire de radiateurs. Sacrilège!

En fait, Harley-Davidson, comme pour lancer le message que le changement et l'évolution ne l'effraient pas, ne s'est pas arrêté là et a aussi considérablement retravaillé la partie cycle de sa monture de tourisme. Elle bénéficie dorénavant d'une fourche beaucoup plus costaude et de suspensions calibrées pour offrir un confort de roulement encore plus élevé que par le passé.

Par ailleurs, et c'est probablement là l'un des changements les plus délicats et controversés qui aient été apportés à l'Electra Glide 2014 (ainsi qu'aux modèles qui en sont dérivés, comme la très populaire Street Glide), la forme du fameux carénage ""Batwing"" (ainsi surnommé en raison de sa forme rappelant des ailes d'une chauve-souris) a été repensée.

Ceux qui ne connaissent pas très bien l'univers Harley-Davidson se demanderont probablement à quoi rime la controverse ou le risque liés à une légère révision esthétique et à une amélioration technique, mais ils doivent encore et toujours se rappeler que la clientèle de la marque américaine - qui vient d'ailleurs tout juste de célébrer ses 110 ans - est unique, en ce sens qu'elle refuse le changement et l'interprète comme une attaque à la nature divine des produits actuels.

Ainsi, comme un parent qui arrive à faire manger des oignons à un enfant qui les refuse en les mélangeant, à petite dose et en cachette, dans un mets familier, le constructeur procède aux changements nécessaires de manière aussi subtile et discrète que possible.

Dans certains cas, ces améliorations vont même jusqu'à être presque invisibles. Le nouveau refroidissement par liquide de l'Electra Glide en est un bel exemple, puisque sa présence est littéralement insoupçonnable, et ce, même pour l'observateur chevronné. En effet, chacun des deux petits radiateurs (ils refroidissent seulement la tête des cylindres; le reste du moteur demeure refroidi par air) est bien caché au creux des protège-jambes, tandis que les durites d'alimentation sont parfaitement dissimulées sous le réservoir. Bref, si l'on ne le savait pas, on croirait qu'il s'agit toujours d'une mécanique exclusivement refroidie par air.

En ce qui concerne le carénage, sa nouvelle forme aurait été la source de discussions particulièrement animées entre les membres plus ou moins conservateurs de l'équipe de design. Au final, on arrive à voir que quelque chose est nouveau, mais sans que la forme de l'ensemble - qui constitue une partie très importante de la signature visuelle de ces modèles - ne paraisse vraiment différente. Cette manière de subtilement renouveler sans bouleverser décrit de manière très exacte le comportement des nouvelles Electra Glide sur la route. En effet, à leurs commandes, bien qu'on se sente décidément en terrain connu, il est indéniable qu'il y a du nouveau.

L'instrumentation, par exemple, a été complètement redessinée et comporte désormais un gros écran central. Sur la version Ultra Limited haut de gamme, il s'agit même d'un écran tactile avec système de navigation. Branchez un iPhone au système audio et vous découvrirez une sonorité nettement supérieure à celle de modèles précédents. Quant au comportement, il est marqué par une étonnante solidité en virage et par des suspensions dont le nouveau raffinement est tout à fait perceptible. Le poids très élevé, quant à lui, demeure toutefois présent et demande toute l'attention du pilote à l'occasion de manoeuvres lentes, ou encore à l'arrêt.

Et en ce qui concerne ce fameux nouveau moteur refroidi - en partie - par liquide? À part une assez légère augmentation de la poussée, tout est plutôt comme avant, et ce, autant sur le plan de la très plaisante sonorité du gros V-Twin qu'en ce qui concerne son unique manière de doucement trembler. Les fidèles n'y verront que du feu.
