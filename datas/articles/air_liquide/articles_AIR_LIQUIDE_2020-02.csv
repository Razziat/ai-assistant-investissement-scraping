"Air Liquide seeks ITEP approval for Port Allen, Geismar expansions - 10/12 Industry Report","Tue, 25 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjEwMTJpbmR1c3RyeXJlcG9ydC5jb20vcHJvamVjdHMvYWlyLWxpcXVpZGUtc2Vla3MtaXRlcC1hcHByb3ZhbC1mb3ItcG9ydC1hbGxlbi1nZWlzbWFyLWV4cGFuc2lvbnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide is planning $284 million in new construction projects in West Baton Rouge and Ascension parishes, and is vying for ITEP and enterprise zone approval.

Separate ITEP and enterprize zone applications have been filed with the state for both projects.

The West Baton Rouge Parish Council is scheduled to take up its ITEP request at its meeting next week, as well as a second application by Reliant Technologies for a $1.5 million expansion project.

Air Liquide plans to build a $145.5 million air separation unit at its Port Allen facility, according to documents filed with the Louisiana Economic Development. The unit would create 10 new jobs, with an estimated annual payroll of $1 million.

A second, $139 million unit is planned for the Geismar facility. That unit is estimated to create four new jobs, with $400,000 in new payroll, and retain 40 jobs with $4 million in payroll. The Ascension Council hasn’t taken up the request yet. Construction on both projects is expected to begin in January 2021. Each would provide 150 temporary construction jobs.

The company has also applied for an enterprise zone tax credit, asking for a $3,500 or $1,000 tax credit for each new job created.

Air Liquide announced the projects in September as part of an agreement with Methanex to supply its plant expansion project in Geismar. The announcement says the company will build two new air separation units. Each unit will have a 2,500 tons-per-day capacity for oxygen, a 25% increase. Production is expected to begin by mid-2020.

“Air Liquide’s significant investment to support this new endeavor by Methanex and enhance our infrastructure in the Geismar Basin further demonstrates our global commitment to energy efficiency, our collaborative approach to meeting the needs of customers, and highlights our outlook for the robust growth of industry in the Gulf Coast region of the U.S.” Michael J. Graff, executive vice president and executive committee member at Air Liquide Group, said at the time.

Reliant Technology in Port Allen expanded its manufacturing capacity with a $1.5 million project, scheduled to have been completed by the end of 2019. That project is expected to create three new jobs, with $100,000 in payroll, and retain seven others, according to LED documents."

"2019: A landmark year for performance, investments and commitment to climate - Air Liquide","Tue, 11 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5haXJsaXF1aWRlLmNvbS9ncm91cC9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy1uZXdzLzIwMjAtMDItMTEvMjAxOS1sYW5kbWFyay15ZWFyLXBlcmZvcm1hbmNlLWludmVzdG1lbnRzLWFuZC1jb21taXRtZW50LWNsaW1hdGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Commenting on the results for 2019, Benoît Potier, Air Liquide Chairman and CEO, stated:

“2019 is a landmark year, characterized simultaneously by a significant improvement in performance, a high level of investments to serve our customers and strengthen our efficiency, and the operational implementation of our climate action plan.

2019 sales were driven by the development of Gas & Services and Global Markets & Technologies. On a comparable basis, all Gas & Services activities, which account for 96% of Group revenue, progressed over the year, with particularly dynamic Electronics and Healthcare. Geographically, every region grew, notably the Europe and Asia-Pacific regions.

Overall, and despite the expected global economic slowdown observed in the 4th quarter, the Group delivered robust results, confirming the relevance of its economic model and strategy.

The improvement in the Group’s operating margin reflects the dynamic management of both pricing and product mix, the asset portfolio, and efficiencies. The latter reached 433 million euros. Cash flows were high and the debt to equity ratio declined substantially. The Group’s balance sheet is solid. ROCE continues to improve. 2019 performance is in line with all of the targets of the NEOS program and the Group’s Climate objectives.

In a context where industrial opportunities remain high, investment decisions rose sharply, to 3.7 billion euros. The new projects that have been signed with our clients in Large Industry and Electronics will allow us to further strengthen our position in our major industrial basins.

Assuming no major change in the environment and the international health situation is under control, Air Liquide is confident in its ability to further increase its operating margin and to deliver net profit growth in 2020, at constant exchange rates.”

Group revenue for 2019 totaled 21,920 million euros, up +3.2% on a comparable basis. Gas & Services enjoyed robust comparable sales growth of +3.5% despite the slowing economic environment in the 4th quarter of 2019. In Engineering & Construction, sales to third-party customers were down compared with 2018, with resources mainly allocated to internal projects. Global Markets & Technologies continued its dynamic development with growth of +14.9%. The currency impact was positive at +2.1%, whereas the energy impact was unfavorable (-1.4%). The acquisition of Tech Air in the United States at the end of the 1st quarter of 2019 and the disposal of Fujian Shenyuan in September generated a significant scope impact of +0.4% over the year. The Group's published revenue growth was therefore up +4.3% for 2019.

Gas & Services revenue reached 21,040 million euros in 2019, up +3.5% on a comparable basis. As published sales were up +4.6% in 2019, with the unfavorable energy impact (-1.5%) more than offset by the favorable currency (+2.1%) and significant scope (+0.5%) impacts.

Revenue in the Americas totaled 8,460 million euros in 2019, an increase of +1.5% in comparable growth. Large Industries sales were stable in 2019, due to several customer maintenance turnarounds in the United States during the 2 nd half of the year. Industrial Merchant revenue growth was resilient at +0.7%, driven mainly by higher prices. Electronics growth stood at +2.1% and Healthcare continued to improve strongly (+9.7%), in particular in Medical Gases in the United States and Latin America.

Revenue in Europe reached 7,172 million euros over 2019, up +3.4% on a comparable basis driven mainly by good Healthcare sales momentum (+5.2%) and a solid growth in Industrial Merchant (+3.4%), notably thanks to high price impacts and robust volumes. Large Industries sales (+1.7%) were driven by higher hydrogen volumes for refineries in Benelux, whereas demand remained weaker in the Steel and Chemical sectors.

Revenue in the Asia Pacific zone totaled 4,794 million euros in 2019, up +7.7% on a comparable basis. Large Industries sales grew strongly (+9.7%) thanks to the ramp-up of several units in China. Industrial Merchant growth was solid (+3.7%), in particular in China and South-East Asia. Electronics revenue maintained its very dynamic growth momentum in 2019 (+10.4%) despite a major decline in Equipment & Installations sales in the 4 th quarter compared with record high sales in 2018.

Revenue in the Middle East and Africa zone amounted to 614 million euros, up +1.5% over 2019 on a comparable basis. Industrial Merchant remained very dynamic in the Middle East, Egypt and India, with strong helium sales in particular. Activity was up slightly in Large Industries, with the major units in the region, located in Saudi Arabia and South Africa, now operating at full capacity. The Healthcare business continued to grow in Egypt and Saudi Arabia.

All businesses contributed to growth in 2019, in particular Healthcare and Electronics. Large Industries (+3.4%) benefited notably from sustained hydrogen volumes in Europe and Asia and from the ramp-up of several new units. In a less favorable economic environment in the 4th quarter 2019, Industrial Merchant growth reached +1.9% over the year, driven mainly by efficient price management (+3.6%), including helium. Strong healthcare growth (+5.7%) was due to organic sales growth, in particular in Home Healthcare in Europe and Latin America and in Medical Gases in the United States. Electronics revenue maintained a very dynamic growth momentum over the year (+7.9%) with double-digit growth for Carrier Gases and Advanced Materials sales.

Consolidated Engineering & Construction revenue, at 328 million euros, was down compared with 2018, with resources mainly allocated to internal projects in Large Industries and Electronics. Total sales including Group projects were up, boosted by a record-high level of investment decisions, in particular in Large Industries.

Global Markets & Technologies revenue was up +14.9% in 2019 on a comparable basis, at 552 million euros. Biomethane grew strongly thanks to the ramp-up of several units in Europe. Sales of equipment related to the Turbo Brayton technology, which reduces greenhouse gas emissions when transporting natural gas by sea, also strongly contributed to this growth.

In 2019, efficiencies increased markedly by +23.4% to 433 million euros, compared with 351 million euros in 2018. These represented savings of 2.7% of the cost base and largely exceeded the objective, which had been set at more than 400 million euros after the reinforcement of the program at the beginning of the year. The main drivers of this increase in efficiencies are the roll-out of digital tools, the continuation of the realignment plans and the ramp-up of Airgas within the program.

The Group’s operating income recurring (OIR) reached 3,794 million euros for 2019, a published increase of +10.0%, or +7.5% on a comparable basis. The operating margin (OIR to revenue) stood at 17.3%, a marked improvement of +90 basis points compared to 2018 and of +70 basis points excluding the energy impact, including +10 basis points from the application of IFRS 16. The Gas & Services operating margin stood at 19.1%, an improvement +60 basis points compared with 2018 excluding the energy impact.

Net profit (Group share) amounted to 2,242 million euros in 2019, an increase of +6.1% as published and +6.7% excluding the application of IFRS 16.

Excluding the capital loss on the disposal of the Fujian Shenyuan units in 2019 and the non-recurring financial gain in 2018, recurring net profit[1] Group share was up +11.1%.

Cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital requirement totaled 4,859 million euros and stood at 22.2% of Group sales (21.0% excluding the application of IFRS 16). This represented strong published growth of +14.5% (+8.3% excluding the application of IFRS 16).

In 2019, gross industrial capital expenditure for the Group amounted to 2,636 million euros, a major increase of +17.2% compared to 2018. It represented 12.0% of sales. The net debt-to-equity ratio stood at 64.0% at the end of December 2019, an improvement of -480 basis points compared to the end of 2018.

Industrial and financial investment decisions represented a total of 3.7 billion euros in 2019, a +19.8% increase compared with 2018. Industrial investment decisions reached a record high of 3,157 million euros, with major investments for long-term contracts with Large Industries customers, mainly in strategic basins where the Group is already present. The 12-month portfolio of opportunities remained strong and totaled 2.9 billion euros, an increase compared with 2.6 billion euros at the end of 2018.

Recurring ROCE[1] which excludes the capital loss on the disposal of the Fujian Shenyuan units on net profit, stood at 8.6%, i.e. a +60 basis points improvement compared to the end of December 2018. This improvement is in line with the Group’s NEOS target of returning to a ROCE of above 10% by 2021-2022.

Regarding to the extra financial performance of the Group, lost time accident frequency improved and reached 1.2 at the end of 2019. This represents the lowest employees lost time accident frequency rate of the last 20 years. In 2019, the Group’s carbon intensity declined further and reached 4.6 kg of CO2 equivalent per euro of EBITDA[2]. It is lower than the initial forecast, notably from the disposal of the Fujian Shenyuan units but also because of several customer maintenance turnarounds, leading to lower production volumes. In January 2020, the Group's commitment has been rewarded twice by the CDP[3], who gave Air Liquide the highest grade ""A"" both for its actions in favor of climate and its sustainable management of water. In addition, Air Liquide had 29% of women among engineers and managers in 2019 and aims to reach 35% by 2025.

Air Liquide’s Board of Directors, which met on February 10, 2020, approved the audited financial statements for the 2019 fiscal year. The Statutory Auditors are in the process of issuing a report with an unqualified opinion.

At the next Annual General Meeting the payment of a dividend of 2.70 euros per share will be proposed. Following the free share attribution of 1 for 10 in October 2019, the proposed dividend shows a strong growth of +12.4% compared with last year. The ex-dividend date is scheduled for May 11, 2020 and the payment is scheduled for May 13, 2020.

The Board also approved the draft resolutions that will be submitted for a vote by the General Meeting on May 5, 2020, concerning in particular:

the proposed reappointment, for a four-year term, of Mr. Brian Gilvary , a member of the company’s Board of Directors since 2016 and a member of the Audit and Accounts Committee since 2017;

the proposed appointment, for a four-year term, of Ms. Anette Bronder and Ms. Kim-Ann Mink. Ms. Bronder will bring to the Board her strong digital expertise, as well as her experience of large international groups in the fields of IT and telecom. Ms. Mink will bring to the Board, in addition to her scientific academic background and her experience in research and innovation, her strong leadership skills and deep understanding of the chemical sector.

The Board of Directors has, moreover, taken note that the terms of office of Mr. Pierre Dufour and Ms. Karen Katen will expire at the close of the 2020 General Meeting. The Board thanked them warmly for their considerable contribution to the work of the Board and its Committees. The Board stated its intention, furthermore, to appoint Ms. Annette Winkler as a replacement for Mr. Pierre Dufour as Chairman of the Environment and Society Committee, Mr. Xavier Huillard as a member of the Appointments and Governance Committee as a replacement for Ms. Karen Katen, and Mr. Brian Gilvary as a member of the Remuneration Committee as a replacement for Ms. Annette Winkler, with effect from that date.

At the close of the General Meeting on May 5 , 2020, the Board of Directors would thus have 12 members, of whom 11 are elected and one is an employee Director. The Board of Directors would include 6 women and 6 foreign members.

Furthermore, the Board of Directors will propose that the General Meeting bring the articles of association into line with the provisions of the PACTE law, in order to provide for the appointment of a second employee Director, if the number of Directors is more than 8 members, the said Director to be appointed by the European Works’ Council.

Finally, in accordance with the new provisions resulting from the PACTE law, the Board of Directors will submit for the vote of the General Meeting the elements of Mr. Benoît Potier’s remuneration for 2019, in his capacity as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, together with the information relating to the remuneration for all the corporate officers. The General Meeting will also be invited to decide upon the remuneration policy for the corporate officers which will apply to Mr. Benoît Potier and to the Company’s Directors.

French corporations accused of racial discrimination against north-African job applicants - Euronews,"Fri, 07 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cm9uZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIwLzAyLzA3L2ZyZW5jaC1jb3Jwb3JhdGlvbnMtYWNjdXNlZC1vZi1yYWNpYWwtZGlzY3JpbWluYXRpb24tYWdhaW5zdC1ub3J0aC1hZnJpY2FuLWpvYi1hcHBsaWNhbnRz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A government study found applicants with Arabic-sounding names received 25% fewer responses than candidates with French names.

ADVERTISEMENT

A new study commissioned by the French government has ""named and shamed"" seven multinational companies, including hotel giant Accor and vehicle manufacturer Renault, for racial discrimination in employment.

The study found that candidates with Arabic-sounding names received on average 25% fewer responses to job applications than their competitors with French names.

But the seven companies — Air France, Accor, Altran, Arkéma, Renault, Rexel et Sopra Steria — say the methodology was flawed and deny any discriminatory practices in their recruitment.

What's in the study?

Junior Minister for Gender Equality Marlene Schiappa discussed the study's findings on French television.

""The government asked researchers to implement a scientific method, proven, reliable, sound, to send unsolicited applications to 40 companies listed in SBF 120 — so the largest French companies,"" she said.

""Some applications came with French-sounding names, while others had northern African-sounding names.""

""And there are seven companies, out the 40 that were tested, with a strong suspicion of discrimination since applicants with northern African names received 25% fewer responses.""

""And I'm going to tell you the names of these companies because there are no reasons not to. We need transparency in the results. There is Air France, there is Accor hotels, there is Altran, there is Arkéma, there is Renault, there is Rexel and there is Sopra Steria,"" Schiappa said.

Euronews has seen the study, which was published online on Friday.

It was conducted by researchers of the University of Creteil East between October 2018 and January 2018 and based on a sample of 10,349 fictional applications or requests for information.

A key conclusion is that discrimination does not only happen in those seven companies.

""Of all the companies tested, it is estimated that the success rate of the candidate whose name has a northern African consonance is 9.3%, compared to 12.5% for the candidate with a European-sounding name,"" the study found.

It is also worth noting that the study found one company — Air Liquide — practised reverse discrimination, with more positive responses sent to candidates with North African-sounding names.

'Flawed methodology'

The companies incriminated in the study immediately reacted to denounce a ""flawed methodology"" ""leading to inaccurate conclusions.""

In a statement seen by Euronews, Air France said: ""These conclusions are based on the processing of 7 unsolicited applications sent to unidentified employees of the company outside the unique recruitment process used by Air France: the career website and its published offers through which all recruitments are channelled.""

""Air France receives more than 100,000 applications on this website each year. They are all processed and receive a response. All recruitments are conducted by professionals trained in the prevention of discrimination,"" the statement said.

The researchers themselves acknowledged their methodological limitations in the study, noting that the majority of cases was based on unsolicited applications while most of these companies now used a centralized applicant tracking system.

The researchers also said that the tested positions (mainly hostesses and maintenance technicians) were not always in the core competences of the companies, which tended to let subcontractors handle these services.

'Naming and shaming'?

Critics say the government has been reluctant to ""name and shame"" the companies practising discrimination, even though it was a longtime promise of French President Emmanuel Macron.

France Inter public radio reported last month that a larger discrimination study involving 103 companies was ""silenced"" by the government.

Race campaign group Maison des Potes regretted that the publication of the report wasn't matched with strong policies to tackle discrimination.

The NGO requested the government to publicise its recommendations to the companies incriminated in the study."

Thanks to this technology, Air Liquide is helping its customers to reduce their environmental impact. Indeed, the approximately 50 Turbo-Brayton cryogenic units sold have the potential to avoid more than 240,000 tons of CO2-equivalent emissions per year. This equipment is designed to be installed on LNG carriers, both on newly built ships and for retrofitting existing vessels.

This Air Liquide technology was first used in the space industry to cryogenically preserve biological samples on the International Space Station (ISS), before being adapted for the maritime transport industry. It can also be applied to biomethane. For example, it is used to liquefy biomethane generated through the anaerobic digestion of household and agricultural waste. In liquid form, the biomethane can be transported easily to its point of use, as a fuel in NGV stations (Natural Gas for Vehicles) or in ferry terminals. Air Liquide has sold two such units in the Nordics.

Emilie Mouren-Renouard, Member of Air Liquide's Executive Committee in charge of Innovation, Digital & IT, Intellectual Property and the Global Markets & Technologies WBU, said:"
Dangote Refinery: Africa's largest oil facility nears completion - Ventures Africa,"Mon, 24 Feb 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZXNhZnJpY2EuY29tL2RhbmdvdGUtcmVmaW5lcnktYWZyaWNhcy1sYXJnZXN0LW9pbC1mYWNpbGl0eS1uZWFycy1jb21wbGV0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Femi Otedola, Nigerian businessman and philanthropist who recently paid a visit to the Aliko Dangote’s multi-billion-dollar refinery and fertilizer projects in the Lekki Free Trade Zone disclosed that the refinery is 75 percent near completion.

On the current state of other projects in the refinery, Otedola explained that the petrochemical unit is also 60 percent complete. In an Instagram post on Sunday, February 23, 2020, the Nigerian businessman revealed that “Dangote Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited did a test run of its fertilizer plant which is the second-largest in the world after that of Qatar.”

Otedola further commended the Dangote Industries Limited team for a job well done, stating that Aliko Dangote’s dream of making the local refinery “the 8th wonder of the world,” is gradually evolving.

The facility which was initially projected to be ready by 2020 has been moved to H1 2021. Upon completion, the Dangote Refinery which is situated on 6,180 acres (2,500 hectares) of land is expected to be Africa’s biggest oil refinery and the world’s biggest single-train petroleum facility. The refinery will be able to process 650,000 barrels of crude oil per day into refined petroleum products which will help Nigeria become an oil refining country, not just an oil exporter.

Nigeria currently imports the majority of its refined petroleum due to a lack of domestic refining capacity in the country. With this new facility, Nigeria’s refining capacity will double and help in meeting the increasing demand for fuels while providing cost savings. The refinery’s location at Lekki Free Trade Zone along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean will allow for smooth transhipment of refined petroleum products to international markets, and ultimately eliminate the overreliance of fuel import from other regions into Nigeria.

Estimated to cost about $18billion, the refinery will produce Euro-V quality gasoline and diesel, as well as jet fuel and polypropylene. During different phases of the project, a total of 4,000 direct and 145,000 indirect jobs will be generated. International and local contractors like MAN Diesel & Turbo, Schneider Electric, C&I Leasing, Honeywell UOP, and Air Liquide Engineering & Construction have benefitted from the building of the refinery.

Similarly, the high unemployment rate in Nigeria which is estimated to reach 33.5 percent this year, will diminish as the refinery is set on employing citizens of the country especially young people to handle different areas in the facility."
