"Go Inside Liquid Sky, The Experimental Berlin Club That Doesn't Have Turntables Or CDJs | Telekom Electronic Beats - Electronic Beats","Tue, 08 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsZWN0cm9uaWNiZWF0cy5uZXQvZ28taW5zaWRlLWxpcXVpZC1za3ktdGhlLWV4cGVyaW1lbnRhbC1iZXJsaW4tY2x1Yi10aGF0LWRvZXNudC1oYXZlLXR1cm50YWJsZXMtb3ItY2Rqcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"You’ll be hard pressed to find anything representative of “ordinary” DJ culture at the Berlin bar and club Liquid Sky. The venue, which Ingmar Koch—one half of the legendary Cologne outfit Air Liquide—co-created in 2017, has no turntables or CDJs. Instead, it shuns conservatism in club culture and opens its doors to anything unusual, and live, improvised music is welcomed. Past performers have used all kinds of unconventional equipment: shortwave radios, old Gameboys, custom-made synth modules and hacked home fitness trainers.

Koch has been interested in “controlled and uncontrolled chaos,” as he puts it, since he started making electronic music in the early ‘90s. This mindset also informed Liquid Sky Cologne, the predecessor to his current incarnation of Liquid Sky, which he ran between 1996 and 2006.

According to Koch, a pair of turntables or CDJs don’t provide the amount of chaotic energy and unpredictability that he and his comrades at the Liquid Sky collective are after. But the thought of a club space devoid of classic DJ gear still seems to be radical and daring for a lot of people. We contacted Koch to get a better understanding of why someone would create a space like this.

Why does Liquid Sky not have CDJs and turntables?

I think there are nearly 400 bars and clubs in Berlin where electronic music is played on turntables and CD players. Liquid Sky Berlin was and is not intended to be the 401st place where that happens. I have a lot of friends who experiment with shortwave radio. I also have a great affinity for Holger Czukay. He is one of the reasons why I started producing experimental electronic music in the early ‘90s. I loved his shortwave radio orgies back then. That’s why it has always been clear to me that if it has to be a DJ, then let’s go beyond the tried and tested set-up and make it a shortwave radio DJ, a dictaphone DJ or a cassette DJ.

What are the origins of Liquid Sky?

Liquid Sky was originally founded in 1986 in Sao Paulo, by Claudia Ray and Carlos Soul Slinger, in response to the eponymous film. The two saw the film and then founded a fashion and music label of the same name. Then they went to New York and opened a clothing store. At the beginning of the ‘90’s, Liquid Sky was one of the big American fashion labels.

I met Carlos and Claudia in 1992. At the time I still lived in Cologne. I made music and released records in all sorts of constellations and under many different project names. Air Liquide with Cem Oral is certainly my best-known project. When I met Carlos and Claudia for the first time, it was as if we had known each other for years. We have very similar interests and preferences—for ambient and noise and environmental protection, for instance."
Distran provides technology at the service of leaks detection - forbes.fr,"Fri, 25 Jan 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5mci9tZWRpYXNmcmFuY2UvZGlzdHJhbi1wcm92aWRlcy10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWF0LXRoZS1zZXJ2aWNlLW9mLWxlYWtzLWRldGVjdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Distran is a technology start-up specializing in ultrasonic inspection solutions that was founded in 2013 as a spin-off of the Swiss Polytechnic School ETH based in Zurich. Distran developed the ultrasound camera, that allows to reduce industrial risks, decrease downtime of industrial installations and minimize environmental impact. Distran’s innovative solutions are currently in use in refineries and thermal power plants in France, Switzerland, Germany and the Middle East. Among Distran’s customers there are General Electric, Total, Air Liquide and RUAG.

The Distran team currently consists of 10 people and is growing continuously. For further development, Distran can also count on its two largest current investors, Energie 360°, the main energy supplier in Switzerland and the Zurich Cantonal Bank (ZKB).

A safe, real-time detection method

The detection of a gas leak is usually a complex issue in a refinery or thermal power plant. Invisible and usually odorless gas can escape for days before the leaks are detected. Searching for industrial leaks in suspicious areas with standard detectors can take up to several days, during which personnel are exposed to potentially dangerous emissions.

Distran ultrasound cameras are based on the well-known principle of acoustic cameras, whose ancestors were already in use in the 1930s to locate the enemy artillery. Thanks to its 128 inbuilt microphones, Distran ultrasound cameras can detect the emission of sounds produced by the leaks within a twenty-meter radius zone and an accuracy of less than a degree. As a result, Distran customers are able to limit contacts with toxic or explosive gases and save considerable inspection time.

After a brief initial training, every single operator can efficiently detect leaks through the “acoustic images” displayed in real-time on the other side of the camera sensor. The resulting image is overlapped with a standard optical image so that the user can easily locate malfunctions before the situation turns into a danger.

A contribution to environmental protection

Distran cameras not only prevent unplanned downtime and preserve the health and safety of the workers in industrial plants, they also reduce the environmental air pollution by providing a fast and practical detection means of leaks.

All gas emissions affect human beings in the short or medium term. Distran is in particular detecting leaks of greenhouse gases such as natural gas, known for its global warming potential (GWP), which is almost 25 times higher than CO2, and refrigerant gases, such as CFCs or HCFCs, whose GWP can reach 12400 times that of CO2. To provide greater safety to a larger range of customers, Distran is planning a new ATmosphere Explosive (ATEX) version of its cameras for companies dealing with explosive gases. At the same time Distran is constantly improving its current sensors with software updates. In 2018, Distran released an update that allows to estimate the flow of spotted leaks in real-time thanks to a patented method.

In its primary role in environmental defence, the Swiss start-up is supported by the Swiss Climate Foundation and the Federal Office for the Environment."
