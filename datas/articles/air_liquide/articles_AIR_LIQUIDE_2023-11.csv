The mass production of electrolyzer components will allow the manufacturing of low-carbon hydrogen at industrial scale and competitive cost, and foster an innovative European ecosystem. The state-of-the-art gigawatt factory will ramp-up to an annual production capacity of three gigawatts by 2025. With two global leading companies in their field combining their expertises, this Franco-German partnership plays a pivotal role in the emergence of a sustainable hydrogen economy needed to forge the energy transition.

Located in Berlin, the new manufacturing site inaugurated today spans over 2,000 square meters. It leverages automation and robotics for the series production of Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyzer modules, the main component of the electrolyzer. The PEM modules offer a high degree of efficiency and are particularly adapted to an intermittent renewable energy supply. With one gigawatt currently, Air Liquide and Siemens Energy expect a ramp-up to annual production capacity of three gigawatts by 2025. Once produced, the assembly of the modules to be implemented in electrolyzer projects can be carried closer to the project sites, contributing further to the cost effectiveness of the solution.

The strategic partnership benefits from a portfolio of hydrogen projects combining both Air Liquide and Siemens Energy’s pipelines, targeting large industrial-scale projects worldwide in collaboration with customers. In Europe, a number of low-carbon and renewable hydrogen projects are already under development. In Oberhausen, Germany, the Air Liquide’s Trailblazer 20 MW large-scale electrolyzer project is reaching completion and aims to accelerate the decarbonization of the Rhine-Ruhr industrial basin. Near Port-Jérôme, France, the Air Liquide Normand’Hy 200 MW electrolyzer project is the largest PEM electrolyzer under construction, avoiding the emission of 250,000 tonnes of CO2 per year. Both groups are working on several other large-scale electrolyzer projects, such as Siemens Energy’s ones in Kassø (Denmark) or FlagshipONE (Sweden), which will provide hydrogen for the synthesis of efuels for shipping.

This partnership will benefit from the expertise of both Groups, including Siemens Energy state-of-the-art technology and industrial capacity along with Air Liquide’s mastery of hydrogen along the whole value-chain and capacity to develop innovative custom-made solutions. Both Groups will also continue to dedicate R&D capacities to the co-development of the next generations of electrolyzer technologies.

François Jackow, CEO of Air Liquide Group:

The mass production of industrial scale electrolyzers is essential to making competitive renewable hydrogen a reality. Our joint-venture with Siemens Energy brings the best of our respective expertises together and allows us to offer the most-suited products to the market. This state-of-the art technology will soon be operated at the Trailblazer electrolyzer in Oberhausen, with a major scale up coming for the Normand'Hy electrolyzer project. More than ever, hydrogen is proving to be a key element of the transition to a low-carbon society.

US Department of Labor finds global gas manufacturer's safety failures led to 25-year-old worker's life-altering injuries ... - US Department of Labor,"Thu, 16 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRvbC5nb3YvbmV3c3Jvb20vcmVsZWFzZXMvb3NoYS9vc2hhMjAyMzExMTYtMNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"US Department of Labor finds global gas manufacturer’s safety failures led to 25-year-old worker’s life-altering injuries after High Springs explosion

Air Liquide Advanced Materials Inc. exposed employees to fire, explosion hazards

HIGH SPRINGS, FL – A global manufacturer of industrial gas could have prevented a May 2023 explosion in High Springs that severely injured several employees by following required operating procedures in the manufacturing process, a U.S. Department of Labor investigation has found.

After the explosion at Air Liquide Advanced Materials Inc., investigators with the department’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration initiated an inspection at the manufacturer site, where diborane — a toxic, colorless and pyrophoric gas — is produced, distilled, mixed and transferred.

OSHA determined the explosion occurred as a 25-year-old product technician used a heat gun to transfer gas from an aluminum source cylinder to a steel cylinder. The blast propelled the worker through the building’s wall, causing severe injuries. They were flown to UF Shands Hospital’s trauma center and treated for brain injuries, third-degree burns and a leg amputation. Four other workers suffered various injuries and were treated at the hospital. In addition, first responders aiding in the employees’ rescue suffered chemical burns to their hands and necks and were taken to the UF Shands Hospital Burn Center.

After its investigation, OSHA cited Air Liquide Advanced Materials for willfully exposing workers to fire and explosion hazards by requiring them to use equipment not intrinsically safe in the presence of flammable chemicals and vapors. The agency also cited the employer for 12 serious violations for the following failures:

Not containing safe upper and lower limits for temperatures, pressures and flows, and thermal and chemical stability data on the process safety information documents.

Failing to conduct a process hazard analysis to adequately address hazards related to impure or contaminated materials produced in mixing and reaction processes.

Not retaining and addressing hazard analysis recommendations promptly and tracking resolutions.

Failing to address requirements for the operating limits specified for cylinder temperatures in written operating procedures.

Not removing equipment in hazardous locations with ignitable or combustible properties of specific gases, vapors, dust or fibers present.

Not classifying buildings as process safety management sites properly and documenting that equipment complied with recognized good engineering practices.

OSHA proposed $201,573 in penalties to address the safety violations found in the investigation.

“By putting production ahead of safety, Air Liquide Advanced Materials altered a young worker’s life permanently. Our investigation found the company worked to increase productivity at its High Springs facility but failed to employ safety measures required for the production of a toxic chemical, diborane,” said OSHA Area Office Director Scott Tisdale in Jacksonville, Florida. “No employee should ever risk their life or well-being needlessly to earn a living. This preventable tragedy must serve as a reminder of the importance of complying with safety and health standards, as required by law.”

Founded in 1902, Air Liquide Advanced Materials Inc. manufactures gases, technologies and services for industry and health. The company operates in 75 countries with more than 66,000 employees and 3.8 million customers and patients.

The company has 15 business days from receipt of the citations and penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA, or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.

Are You Looking for a Top Momentum Pick? Why Air Liquide (AIQUY) is a Great Choice - Yahoo Finance,"Mon, 27 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9sb29raW5nLXRvcC1tb21lbnR1bS1waWNrLXdoeS0xNzAwMDYwODEuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.

Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.

Below, we take a look at Air Liquide (AIQUY), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.

It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Air Liquide currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.

You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>

Set to Beat the Market?

Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for AIQUY that show why this company shows promise as a solid momentum pick.

Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.

Story continues

For AIQUY, shares are up 3.74% over the past week while the Zacks Chemical - Diversified industry is up 4.49% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 12.72% compares favorably with the industry's 9.68% performance as well.

While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Shares of Air Liquide have increased 5.64% over the past quarter, and have gained 29.32% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 4.59% and 14.85%, respectively.

Investors should also take note of AIQUY's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, AIQUY is averaging 106,211 shares for the last 20 days.

Earnings Outlook

The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with AIQUY.

Over the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost AIQUY's consensus estimate, increasing from $1.35 to $1.36 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.

Bottom Line

Taking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that AIQUY is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Air Liquide on your short list.

We Ran A Stock Scan For Earnings Growth And L'Air Liquide (EPA:AI) Passed With Ease - Simply Wall St,"Tue, 28 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3NpbXBseXdhbGwuc3Qvc3RvY2tzL2ZyL21hdGVyaWFscy9lcGEtYWkvbGFpci1saXF1aWRlLXNoYXJlcy9uZXdzL3dlLXJhbi1hLXN0b2NrLXNjYW4tZm9yLWVhcm5pbmdzLWdyb3d0aC1hbmQtbGFpci1saXF1aWRlLWVwYdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Investors are often guided by the idea of discovering 'the next big thing', even if that means buying 'story stocks' without any revenue, let alone profit. Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.

In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like L'Air Liquide ( ), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business.

How Fast Is L'Air Liquide Growing?

Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Over the last three years, L'Air Liquide has grown EPS by 12% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.

Careful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. While we note L'Air Liquide achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 11% to €30b. That's progress.

In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.

While we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check ?

Are L'Air Liquide Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?

Since L'Air Liquide has a market capitalisation of €91b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth €115m. This comes in at 0.1% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.

While it's always good to see some strong conviction in the company from insiders through heavy investment, it's also important for shareholders to ask if management compensation policies are reasonable. Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. For companies with market capitalisations over €7.3b, like L'Air Liquide, the median CEO pay is around €4.2m.

The L'Air Liquide CEO received €3.0m in compensation for the year ending December 2022. That comes in below the average for similar sized companies and seems pretty reasonable. While the level of CEO compensation shouldn't be the biggest factor in how the company is viewed, modest remuneration is a positive, because it suggests that the board keeps shareholder interests in mind. It can also be a sign of a culture of integrity, in a broader sense.

Is L'Air Liquide Worth Keeping An Eye On?

One positive for L'Air Liquide is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. Earnings growth might be the main attraction for L'Air Liquide, but the fun does not stop there. With company insiders aligning themselves considerably with the company's success and modest CEO compensation, there's no arguments that this is a stock worth looking into. Even so, be aware that , you should know about...

Although L'Air Liquide certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares. If you like to see insider buying, then this free , could be exactly what you're looking for.

This 3rd edition of the Scientific Challenge aimed at identifying and accelerating the development of innovative solutions for the decarbonization of industrial ecosystems, in an open innovation approach. The laureates’ projects will receive funding from Air Liquide to develop their proposed solutions and to transform them into market-ready technologies.

Can LI, Davidson School of Chemical Engineering, Purdue University, USA, is the Laureate of the “Data sharing for decarbonization” topic. The sharing of data between the different stakeholders of an industrial basin using the same utilities connected by physical networks is crucial to meet shared sustainability targets. Can LI’s proposal focuses on the development of algorithms facilitating data sharing, ensuring transparency as well as data privacy and security, to achieve industrial optimizations and reduce CO2 emissions.

Luis Miguel MADEIRA, Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto, Portugal, is the Laureate of the “Energy storage using Essential Small Molecules” topic. Renewable energies are intermittent by nature. To ensure their widespread adoption and contribute to the decarbonization of the energy sector, it is essential to develop new ways of storing and reusing electricity, using Essential Small Molecules. Luis Miguel MADEIRA’s project focuses on a new technology development based on an innovative cyclic system, to produce methane (CH4) as an energy carrier, from industrial captured CO2 and renewable hydrogen (H2).

Enrico TRONCONI, Department of Energy, Politecnico di Milano, Italy, is the Laureate of the “Electric Heating for Hydrogen (H2) production” topic. One way of decarbonizing hydrogen production would be to electrify the heat generation required for steam-methane reforming. Yet achieving the reaction temperature (800°C) with electric power is a challenge. Enrico TRONCONI’s proposal consists in a new technological solution enabling an efficient electrified Steam Methane Reforming process. Based on a new conductive device harnessing the resistive heating, this solution helps reduce the energy consumption and the CO2 emissions of the hydrogen production process.

The three laureates were selected by a Jury of 8 members, headed by Air Liquide Vice-President Research & Development Jérôme Christin. It included in particular Professor Isabelle Ryl, Director of PRAIRIE at INRIA (PaRis Artificial Intelligence Research InstitutE), and Professor Steven Chu, Nobel Prize Laureate in Physics, former US Secretary for Energy, Professor at Stanford University, USA.

Air Liquide Advanced Materials, Inc., of High Springs, Florida, a global manufacturer of industrial gas, faces $201,573 in penalties following a May 2023 explosion that severely injured several employees, OSHA announced November 16. The employer could have prevented the accident by following required operating procedures in the manufacturing process, according to the agency.

After the explosion, OSHA investigators initiated an inspection at the manufacturing site, where diborane—a toxic, colorless, and pyrophoric gas—is produced, distilled, mixed, and transferred.

Drug, chemical maker cited in fatal explosion

PolyCarbon Industries, Inc., a Newburyport, Massachusetts, pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturer, is facing $298,254 in OSHA penalties after a pressure vessel exploded, causing an employee’s fatal injuries, the agency announced November 16.

OSHA inspectors identified several deficiencies in the facility’s process safety management program for highly hazardous chemicals in the production and drying of a chemical product called Dekon 139 and for combustible dust hazards.

The agency found that the employer didn’t:

Determine the combustibility hazards of materials used in the Dekon 139 production process, exposing employees to fire and explosion hazards from combustible dust.

Include safe upper and lower temperature limits to prevent the decomposition of Dekon 139.

Evaluate the consequences of deviation in the Dekon 139 production process.

Establish written procedures to maintain the ongoing integrity of process equipment, and provide clear instruction on consequences of deviation from steps in the operating procedures.

Update the process safety information to include steps to avoid consequences of deviation in temperature, properties, and hazards of the chemicals used in the process.

Update standard operating procedures for producing Dekon 139 and its safety data sheet.

Review a November 2022 compliance audit report with all affected personnel whose job tasks are relevant to the report findings.

Eni CCS project to create high-tech international value chain in decarbonization sector - WorldOil,"Thu, 30 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53b3JsZG9pbC5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzExLzMwL2VuaS1jY3MtcHJvamVjdC10by1jcmVhdGUtaGlnaC10ZWNoLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtdmFsdWUtY2hhaW4taW4tZGVjYXJib25pemF0aW9uLXNlY3Rvci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Eni CCS project to create high-tech international value chain in decarbonization sector

(WO) – The Callisto (CArbon LIquefaction transportation and STOrage) Mediterranean CO 2 Network integrated CCS project jointly proposed by Eni and Snam, in collaboration with Air Liquide, has been selected by the European Commission to join the list of Projects of Common Interest (PCI). The project was chosen, having passed the selection process, along with 13 other projects dedicated to carbon capture and storage.

In detail, Callisto aims to develop a CCS value chain in southwestern Europe, focusing on the decarbonization of the Italian industrial areas, starting with those of Ravenna and Ferrara and the Fos-Marseille Hub in France. The project is led by Eni and Snam in Italy, and Air Liquide for the Fos-Marseille industrial cluster in France. The initiative has also been promoted by other 16 companies operating in the industrial clusters involved.

By leveraging the large total storage capacity of the Ravenna CCS hub, estimated at more than 500 million tonnes, the project aims to develop the largest network in the Mediterranean for carbon capture, transport, and storage by offering a decarbonization solution for hard to abate industries, acting as a reference for Southern Europe.

The admission to the PCI projects list will allow the project, once it has passed the ongoing process, which is expected to be completed in 2024, to be eligible for the Connecting Europe Facility Fund (CEF) aimed at obtaining non-reimbursable funding to support the studies and development of infrastructure for the reception, transport, and storage of carbon dioxide.

The start-up of Phase 1 of the CCS Ravenna project is scheduled in early 2024 with injection for the purpose of permanent storage of 25,000 tonnes per year of CO 2 , captured from Eni's Casal Borsetti gas power plant. The industrial development of Phase 2, which is scheduled to start by 2026, will achieve a storage capacity of 4 million tonnes per year by 2030. Further expansions could bring the volumes up to 16 million tonnes of CO 2 per year.

The Ravenna CCS project will foster the creation of a national high-tech supply chain in the decarbonization sector, enhancing local and more broadly countrywide skills and capabilities. From an employment point of view, the project will make a decisive contribution in protecting the existing level, linked to the traditional system, while promoting the creation of a significant number of new direct and indirect jobs through the development of the supply chains involved in the decarbonization project.

Eni has developed extensive expertise in storing gas in depleted fields over many decades. It intends to use this to repurpose some of its existing upstream assets into carbon dioxide storage hubs to decarbonize both its own and third parties' industrial activities at a competitive cost and with fast time to market."
"Siemens Energy, Air Liquide open 1-GW electrolyser factory in Berlin - Renewables Now","Thu, 09 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vcmVuZXdhYmxlc25vdy5jb20vbmV3cy9zaWVtZW5zLWVuZXJneS1haXItbGlxdWlkZS1vcGVuLTEtZ3ctZWxlY3Ryb2x5c2VyLWZhY3RvcnktaW4tYmVybGluLTgzOTMxNi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Germany’s Siemens Energy AG (ETR:ENR) and France-based industrial gas supplier Air Liquide (EPA:AI) have officially opened their gigawatt-scale electrolyser factory in Berlin, preparing a ramp-up in production to 3 GW annually by 2025.

The manufacturing facility was inaugurated at an official ceremony on Wednesday attended by high-ranking representatives of the German and French governments.

Spanning over 2,000 sq m (21,530 sq ft) across a Siemens Energy site, the factory is equipped with automation and robotics technology for the series production of Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) modules, which is the main component of an electrolyser. It will initially operate at an annual capacity of 1 GW, which will be at least tripled by 2025 and potentially increased further in the future.

The new factory, production lines for which were set up at a cost of some EUR 30 million (USD 32.1m), will supply electrolysis modules, or stacks, and help both Siemens Energy and Air Liquide to serve their large-scale industrial customers and the growing market. One of the first projects to deploy its hardware is the 200-MW Normand’Hy project that is being developed by the two companies in Normandy, France.

“Now we need to agree on a viable business model with a balanced risk and reward profile to turn the smallest molecule into a big success story,” said Christian Bruch, CEO of Siemens Energy.

Siemens Energy and Air Liquide established a joint venture (JV) to produce industrial-scale renewable hydrogen electrolysers last summer. Siemens Energy is the controlling owner of the Berlin-based entity, with a 74.9% stake.

In the presence of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Christian Bruch, CEO of Siemens Energy, and Francois Jackow, the CEO of French joint venture partner Air Liquide, pushed the start button for the series production of the hydrogen technology.

Foundation for the Ramp-up of the Hydrogen Economy

With the new factory, Siemens Energy is making electrolyzers a mass product, laying the foundation for the ramp-up of the hydrogen economy. For hydrogen to become the game changer for a climate-neutral future, it must be available in large quantities and at competitive prices. This requires serial production of cost-effective and scalable electrolyzers. With an annual production capacity of one gigawatt, Siemens Energy and Air Liquide expect a ramp-up to at least three gigawatts by 2025 with potential for more. In comparison: with installed electrolysis capacity of three gigawatt, an average of 300,000 metric tons of green hydrogen can be produced per year when operated with renewable energies. Using this green hydrogen to replace fossil fuels would avoid the CO2 emissions of a major German city with around 260,000 inhabitants like Aachen.

At the Siemens Energy site in Berlin the complete infrastructure of an existing production facility and its experienced workforce can be used. New production lines for the electrolyzers were set up on 2,000 square meters at a cost of around 30 million euros. The new factory will supply stacks – the heart of electrolyzers – for a wide range of customers, serving the fast-growing market. These stacks are based on proton exchange membrane (PEM) technology that is particularly good at following intermittent renewable energy supply. Compared to other hydrogen technologies, PEM electrolyzers enable gigawatt capacities to be brought to market with lower material, manpower and space requirements, making them the ideal enablers of a fast ramp-up. Once produced, the assembly of the stacks to be implemented in electrolyzer projects will be carried closer to the project sites, contributing further to the cost effectiveness of the solution.

The strategic Franco-German partnership benefits from the expertise of both Groups and from a portfolio of hydrogen projects combining both Air Liquide and Siemens Energy’s pipelines. In Europe, a number of low-carbon and renewable large-scale hydrogen projects are already under development. The mass production of industrial scale electrolyzers is essential to making competitive renewable hydrogen a reality."
Air Liquide and Sasol sign new long-term contracts to supply an additional 100 MW of renewable electricity to the ... - Air Liquide,"Tue, 21 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5haXJsaXF1aWRlLmNvbS9ncm91cC9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy1uZXdzLzIwMjMtMTEtMjEvYWlyLWxpcXVpZGUtYW5kLXNhc29sLXNpZ24tbmV3LWxvbmctdGVybS1jb250cmFjdHMtc3VwcGx5LWFkZGl0aW9uYWwtMTAwLW13LXJlbmV3YWJsZS1lbGVjdHJpY2l0edIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide and Sasol have signed new Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) with the global wind and solar company Mainstream Renewable Power, for the long-term supply of a capacity of 97.5 MW of renewable power to Sasol’s Secunda site, in South Africa, where Air Liquide operates the biggest oxygen production site in the world. This is the third set of PPAs signed by Air Liquide and Sasol, after those announced in the first quarter of 2023 with Enel Green Power and TotalEnergies with its partner Mulilo. Together, these PPAs represent a total renewable power capacity of around 580 MW. For Air Liquide, these contracts will contribute to the targeted reduction by 30% to 40% of the CO2 emissions associated with oxygen production in Secunda by 2031.

Within the framework of these PPAs with Air Liquide and Sasol, Mainstream will create a local company with strong socio-economic development commitments which will build a solar farm located in the Free State province. This renewable energy production facility is scheduled to be operational in 2025.

Nicolas Poirot, Chief Executive Officer of the Africa Middle East & India hub, said:

“Together with our long-term partner Sasol, we have secured massive amounts of renewable energy generation capacity. This will significantly contribute to the decarbonisation of our operations in Secunda and actively support the development of renewable energies in South Africa, for the benefit of the South African electrical system and ultimately of the South African society in the context of a Just Transition. In line with Air Liquide’s ADVANCE strategic plan, these PPAs also demonstrate the Group’s capacity to collaborate with its customers to provide solutions which contribute to the decarbonization of its assets as well as of its clients.”

Air Liquide acquired Sasol’s 16 oxygen production units in Secunda and has been operating them since June 2021, in the framework of a long-term supply contract with its partner. Including another Air Separation Unit (ASU) it already operated for Sasol, Air Liquide operates a total of 17 ASUs in Secunda, with a total capacity of 47,000 tonnes/day of oxygen. Air Liquide plans to reduce by 30% to 40% the CO2 emissions (Scope 2) arising from the 16 oxygen production units it acquired from Sasol through a multi-year investment and modernization plan and a steep increase of the site’s procurement of renewable energies."

World premiere: Air Liquide contributes to the first piloted electric flight powered by liquid hydrogen - Air Liquide,"Tue, 28 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5haXJsaXF1aWRlLmNvbS9zdG9yaWVzL2h5ZHJvZ2VuL3dvcmxkLXByZW1pZXJlLWFpci1saXF1aWRlLWNvbnRyaWJ1dGVzLWZpcnN0LXBpbG90ZWQtZWxlY3RyaWMtZmxpZ2h0LXBvd2VyZWQtbGlxdWlkLWh5ZHJvZ2Vu0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"September 2023 saw the first ever piloted electric flight powered by liquid hydrogen. Working with H2FLY, Air Liquide fitted the HY4 hydrogen-electric demonstrator with a new fuel tank which proved that liquid hydrogen is a great step forward – and upward – for zero-emission aviation.

Originally, the HY4 demonstrator ran on gaseous hydrogen, but trials showed that the high pressures needed for such a demonstrator would make the tank too heavy for use in passenger or freight aircraft. “A liquid hydrogen tank is up to ten times lighter than a high pressure one”, says Pierre Crespi, Director of Innovation , Air Liquide advanced Technologies . So as part of the European project HEAVEN, Air Liquide partnered with H2FLY, a start-up developing hydrogen-electric propulsion systems for aviation, to retrofit their HY4 with a liquid hydrogen tank.

It's an event that will surely go down in the history of the aviation industry. In September 2023, taking off from Maribor, Slovenia, a small demonstrator called HY4 completed four manned test flights, one lasting three hours, using liquid hydrogen and a fuel tank supplied by Air Liquide.

Air Liquide developed a 290-liter liquid hydrogen tank for HY4. Before being fitted on the aircraft, the tank went through thorough vibration and electrical tests to enable its use in flight. After it was fitted into the HY4, H2FLY and Air Liquide teams actively collaborated to test all of the aircraft’s functionalities, notably full-power motor operation and liquid hydrogen refueling techniques developed by Air Liquide teams to be used at airports. Before the test, Josef Kallo, Founder and CEO of H2FLY , said “We have a chance to show that electric flight with hydrogen is possible”. On the d-day, the test flights all performed according to the plan and confirmed that using liquid hydrogen would double the aircraft’s maximum range.

The success of this first piloted flight demonstrates the full potential of liquid hydrogen for aviation. With our partners, we are preparing for the future and contributing to the decarbonization of aviation.

With the aviation industry having committed to net zero emissions by 2050, this success is indeed a very important milestone. Due to their unfavorable power-to-weight ratios, batteries of the kind used in cars are out of the question in aviation. Fuel cells fed by renewable hydrogen are, by far, a better way forward. “This tank is rather small compared to what will be needed in the future for larger commercial aircraft,” cautions Pierre Crespi. Yet it does put the industry on course for market-ready solutions by the mid-2030s, when he expects to see planes with 20 to 100 seats powered by liquid hydrogen in use on regional routes, with full-size airliners to follow around 2050.

In technology terms, the groundwork has now been laid: “We have integrated into that tank all the functions and all the safety procedures that will be needed,” he explains, “and by doing that, we are preparing for the future – contributing to decarbonizing aviation.” And with its expertise across the entire hydrogen value chain, from generation and storage to transport, tankage, and fuelling solutions, Air Liquide is ready to provide the thrust that liquid-hydrogen-powered aviation needs for take-off.

"Siemens, Air Liquide begin production at GW-scale electrolyzer factory in Berlin - ETN News","Thu, 09 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vZXRuLm5ld3MvYnV6ei9zaWVtZW5zLWFpci1saXF1aWRlLWVsZWN0cm9seXplci1tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nLWJlcmxpbi1ncmVlbi1oeWRyb2dlbtIBZWh0dHBzOi8vZXRuLm5ld3MvYnV6ei9zaWVtZW5zLWFpci1saXF1aWRlLWVsZWN0cm9seXplci1tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nLWJlcmxpbi1ncmVlbi1oeWRyb2dlbj9mb3JtYXQ9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Siemens Energy and Air Liquide have inaugurated their new multi-gigawatt electrolyzer factory located in Berlin, Germany. The series production of the hydrogen technology was started in the presence of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at the inaugural event.

The manufacturing facility will roll out electrolyzer stacks with an initial capacity of 1 GW this year, which will be gradually ramped up to 2 GW in 2024 and at least 3 GW by 2025, according to the partners.

They claimed that an average of 300,000 metric tons of green hydrogen can be produced per year with a installed electrolyzer capacity of 3 GW, operated using clean energy. Using this green hydrogen to replace fossil fuels would avoid the CO2 emissions of a major German city with around 260,000 inhabitants like Aachen, they added.



Christian Bruch, CEO Siemens Energy, commented, ""There is no energy transition without green molecules. With today's opening and the start of gigawatt-scale production of electrolyzers, we are launching the next step for the commercialization of this vital technology. Now we need to agree on a viable business model with a balanced risk and reward profile to turn the smallest molecule into a big success story.""



The electrolyzer production line has been set up at Siemens Energy's existing production facility in Berlin of a cost of around € 30 million. It will supply stacks based on proton exchange membrane (PEM) technology.

According to the manufacturers, the PEM technology is best suited for intermittent renewable energy supply, and enable GW capacities using limited material, manpower and space requirements, thus making them the ideal enablers of a fast ramp-up.

""The mass production of industrial scale electrolyzers is essential to making competitive renewable hydrogen a reality"", said François Jackow, CEO of Air Liquide Group. ""Our joint-venture with Siemens Energy brings the best of our respective expertise together and allows us to offer the most-suited products to the market. More than ever, hydrogen is proving to be a key element of the transition to a low-carbon society"".

The Franco-German partnership is expected to aid a larger portfolio of hydrogen projects under each company's pipelines. More specifically, the Normand'Hy 200 MW electrolyzer project that is under construction near Port-Jérôme in France by Air Liquide will be one of the first to be equipped with the stacks made from the Berlin plant."
A diversified and balanced approach to energy is working for Nevada - The Nevada Independent,"Tue, 28 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbmV2YWRhaW5kZXBlbmRlbnQuY29tL2FydGljbGUvYS1kaXZlcnNpZmllZC1hbmQtYmFsYW5jZWQtYXBwcm9hY2gtdG8tZW5lcmd5LWlzLXdvcmtpbmctZm9yLW5ldmFkYdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Affordable, safe and reliable energy is the backbone of our state’s economy. It not only provides essential services to Nevadans but also serves as a magnet for new businesses, new industries and new jobs.

For this reason, in early 2023, Gov. Joe Lombardo outlined a comprehensive and balanced energy policy for Nevada that embraces a wide range of fuels, technologies and supporting infrastructure.

The overreaching goal is to develop and maintain a robust, diverse energy supply portfolio that ensures Nevada's energy needs are met. And our state is making significant progress toward this objective on multiple fronts.

Let’s start with solar energy. When compared to other states, Nevada ranks sixth in the nation in terms of total solar generation capacity. Solar technology currently provides 23 percent of the state’s electricity and that number continues to climb.

Nevada’s abundant solar resources and pro-business climate continue to attract investments such as Project Gemini, a $1.2 billion, 690-megawatt solar facility located just 30 minutes northeast of Las Vegas. When complete, Project Gemini will generate enough electricity to power 260,000 homes and will have the ability to store surplus daytime energy for nighttime use.

Next, there’s geothermal energy. Many of the same technologies used to drill for oil and natural gas can also be used to tap into underground sources of heat. Nevada is a national leader in this field, generating almost 25 percent of the country’s geothermal electricity already.

Wind farms have not taken off in Nevada as other renewable sources of electricity, but that’s changing. The state’s second wind farm — Stagecoach Wind — has been proposed for White Pine County in Northern Nevada and is currently in the permitting process. The developers of the project are planning enough wind turbines to generate 600 megawatts of electricity, or enough to power around 145,000 households.

Natural gas-fired power plants are currently Nevada’s largest source of electricity. These plants provide critical support for renewable sources such as wind and solar, whose output changes based on weather conditions.

However, natural gas plants can also be dialed back as other sources of energy grow, and that is exactly what’s happening. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, natural gas fired power plants account for 56 percent of the state’s electricity generation, the smallest share in 17 years.

Thanks to Hoover Dam, Nevada is famous for hydroelectricity, of course. But we’re also writing a new chapter for this technology in Nevada as an energy storage solution.

When surplus renewable electricity is used to pump water uphill into a hydroelectric dam, that renewable energy is effectively stored for later use.

In White Pine County, rPlus Hydro is planning to build a 1,000 megawatt pumped hydro energy storage project estimated to be worth $2.5 billion. For scale, rPlus has estimated this single energy storage facility could provide roughly 13 percent of Nevada’s electricity needs for eight hours at a time.

Nevada is also moving ahead with smaller-scale battery storage facilities. They include a 380-megawatt battery connected to the Project Gemini solar installation and a 220-megawatt battery project to be developed in partnership between utility company NV Energy and storage firm Energy Vault.

The state’s energy strategy also includes a role for hydrogen — a highly versatile fuel that can be used across the transportation, electricity and industrial sectors.

In North Las Vegas, Air Liquide recently opened a $250 million production facility where it will process landfill gas into 30 tons of liquid hydrogen per day — enough to power 40,000 hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The North Las Vegas hydrogen plant will be the largest such facility operated by Air Liquide in the world, which is saying something when you consider that Air Liquide does business in more than 70 countries.

A balanced energy portfolio doesn’t stop with fuels, either. From manufacturing to mining, the engineers and scientists who are building new domestic supply chains for the energy sector are here in Nevada.

One of the best examples is the Tesla Gigafactory, located just an hour from Lake Tahoe; it is one of the biggest plants for electric vehicles and batteries in the world. After a $3.6 billion expansion, Gigafactory Nevada will also build electric semitrucks.

This expansion aligns with another component of the state’s energy policy: the Nevada Clean Trucks and Buses Incentive Program. This program was signed into law earlier this year to help small businesses and school districts overcome some of the upfront costs of introducing electric vehicles into their truck and bus fleets so they can benefit sooner from the fuel and maintenance cost savings.

In terms of energy supply chains, Nevada is also a national leader in producing the materials needed to make electric vehicle batteries. Our state is currently home to the country’s only operating lithium mine and there is very strong private sector interest in producing more lithium in Nevada.

When dealing with energy policy, it can be tempting to focus on just a handful of energy sources and pretend that they can meet all of our needs. But in reality, it takes a diversified and balanced approach to deliver the energy, investment and jobs that Nevadans need and deserve.

Electrolyzer factory of the future - siemens-energy.com,"Tue, 07 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpZW1lbnMtZW5lcmd5LmNvbS9nbG9iYWwvZW4vaG9tZS9zdG9yaWVzL2VsZWN0cm9seXplci1naWdhd2F0dC1mYWN0b3J5Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In the factory hall, von Levetzow stops before a chart showing energy production and consumption in the different industrial sectors. A huge part of that chart, power generation, can be decarbonized via direct electrification, he explains. The real challenge has been to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors like the chemical or steel industry, refineries, mobility, shipping and aviation. “The production of green hydrogen is how we make renewable energy available to all sectors of the economy.”

For the production of renewable hydrogen electrolysis stacks, Siemens Energy joined forces with Air Liquide. The joint venture partnership with a company that knows the needs of companies working with industrial gases well, produces synergy for both partners. “In order to quickly ramp up production and reach a scaling effect, we have to convince the market. And that can only be done with a strong partner like Air Liquide with their mastery of hydrogen along the whole value-chain,” says von Levetzow.

The global hydrogen demand reached 95 million tons of hydrogen per year in 2022. Steel production needs hydrogen as a reducing agent. Cargo vessel operators are now looking to source hydrogen for the production of methanol, and aviation and mobility will not be far behind. Today, most hydrogen is produced from coal or natural gas, resulting in the release of harmful emissions. This is why the ability to produce renewable hydrogen on a massive scale stands at the center of an energy revolution. With the Gigafactory, we are achieving this scale. But 3 gigawatts of electrolyzer capacity per year - what does that even mean? With an installed electrolysis capacity of this size, an average of 300,000 tons of renewable hydrogen can be produced per year when operated with renewable energies. Using this hydrogen as a substitute for fossil fuels could, for example, avoid the CO2 emissions of a large German city with a population of around 280,000 (Source: EDGAR - The Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research – europa.eu).​"
OSHA Cites Air Liquide Following May Explosion - Alachua County Today,"Thu, 30 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsYWNodWFjb3VudHl0b2RheS5jb20vbmV3cy1mZWF0dXJlZC9sYXRlc3QvNjAwNy1vc2hhLWNpdGVzLWFpci1saXF1aWRlLWZvbGxvd2luZy1tYXktZXhwbG9zaW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"HIGH SPRINGS ‒ Air Liquide Advanced Materials, Inc., is facing a six-figure Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) penalty following a workplace explosion according to industrial safety and training organization, Safety.BLR.

OSHA announced on Nov. 16 that, “Air Liquide Advanced Materials, Inc., of High Springs, a global manufacturer of industrial gas, faces $201,573 in penalties following a May 2023 explosion that severely injured several employees.” According to their report OSHA found that, “The employer could have prevented the accident by following required operating procedures in the manufacturing process.”

After the explosion, OSHA investigators conducted an inspection at the manufacturing site where “diborane — a toxic, colorless, and pyrophoric gas — is produced, distilled, mixed, and transferred.”

“Inspectors determined that the explosion occurred as a 25-year-old product technician used a heat gun to transfer gas from an aluminum source cylinder to a steel cylinder. The technician was flown to a trauma center and treated for brain injuries, third-degree burns, and a leg amputation. Four other workers suffered various injuries and were treated at the hospital.”

According to Safety.BLR, OSHA cited Air Liquide for “willfully exposing workers to fire and explosion hazards by requiring them to use equipment intrinsically unsafe in the presence of flammable chemicals and vapors.”

OSHA also cited the employer for 12 serious violations for the following failures:

“Not containing safe upper and lower limits for temperatures, pressures and flows, and thermal and chemical stability data on the process safety information documents;

Failing to conduct a process hazard analysis to adequately address hazards related to impure or contaminated materials produced in mixing and reaction processes;

Not retaining and addressing hazard analysis recommendations promptly and tracking resolutions;

Failing to address requirements for the operating limits specified for cylinder temperatures in written operating procedures;

Not removing equipment in hazardous locations with ignitable or combustible properties of specific dust, fibers, gases, or vapors present; and

Not properly classifying buildings as process safety management sites and documenting that equipment complied with recognized good engineering practices.”

In an agency statement, OSHA’s Jacksonville area office director Scott Tisdale said, “By putting production ahead of safety, Air Liquide Advanced Materials altered a young worker’s life permanently. Our investigation found the company worked to increase productivity at its High Springs facility but failed to employ safety measures required for the production of a toxic chemical, diborane.”

The grey hydrogen facility has 300 tonnes a day of H 2 capacity, and Air Products claims that after the retrofit, this will be the largest blue hydrogen facility in Europe once operational in 2026.

While Barents Blue, a clean ammonia project in Norway with an estimated 600 tonnes a day of blue H 2 production, had originally been scheduled to come on line in 2026, this timetable also hinged on FID this year.

However, this is likely to have been delayed by the exit of prospective carbon storage operators Equinor and Vår Energi in February this year, with a new operator, PGNiG, unlikely to be approved by regulators before December.

Air Products plans to store the CO 2 captured from its Rotterdam hydrogen facility via the Netherlands’ flagship Porthos CCS project.

Porthos, developed by a joint venture between state-owned firms EBN, Gasunie, and the Port of Rotterdam Authority, aims to transport 2.5 million tonnes of CO 2 a year over the next 15 years to depleted gas fields offshore for storage 3-4km under the seabed.

The project, which reached final investment decision (FID) earlier this month, has already contracted all 37 million tonnes of storage capacity to four industrial emitters in Rotterdam that had signed joint development agreements: Air Products, fellow industrial gas company Air Liquide, and oil majors Shell and ExxonMobil.

These four companies were in 2021 awarded €2.1bn ($2.26bn) in grants via the Dutch government’s SDE++ scheme, covering the cost gap between the price of the EU’s carbon credits on the Emissions Trading System and the costs involved in developing CCS infrastructure.

Air Products lists ExxonMobil’s refinery in Rotterdam — already an existing customer for grey hydrogen — as an offtaker for its blue H 2 once the project is onstream.

While the industrial gases firm notes that the blue hydrogen plant is backed by a long-term contract with ExxonMobil, it does not provide further details on this agreement.

“Air Products has been actively present and investing in Rotterdam for decades,” said the firm’s chief operating officer Samir Serhan.

“Industrial companies here are continually looking for ways to realise synergies, create economies of scale, drive energy efficiencies and ultimately decarbonise. This project fulfils that demand.

“By sequestering CO 2 through Porthos and bringing additional blue hydrogen to ExxonMobil and other customers, we can help generate a cleaner future.”

Blue hydrogen would theoretically reduce the emissions footprint of ExxonMobil and other industrial H 2 users in the region, reducing not only the need for extra carbon allowances under the EU's Emissions Trading System, but also future payouts to the Dutch government from a strict carbon tax on oil, chemicals and steel companies — passed in 2021 — which will rise to €125 per tonne of CO 2 by 2030.

However, blue H 2 does not count towards the EU’s targets for 42% of hydrogen consumed in the bloc to come from renewable sources by 2030, as defined in its Delegated Acts.

CCS is also controversial, with critics pointing to a number of large projects failing to deliver on promised storage rates, the continued dependence on fossil fuels, and a potential lack of mitigation around upstream methane emissions.

Callisto carbon storage development eligible for EU funding support - Offshore magazine,"Wed, 29 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vZmZzaG9yZS1tYWcuY29tL2VuZXJneS10cmFuc2l0aW9uL2FydGljbGUvMTQzMDIwMjkvY2FsbGlzdG8tY2FyYm9uLXN0b3JhZ2UtZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQtZWxpZ2libGUtZm9yLWV1LWZ1bmRpbmctc3VwcG9ydNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Offshore staff

SAN DONATO MILANESE, Italy — The EU has added the Callisto Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) project to the European list of Projects of Common Interest.

Eni and Italian utility Snam both put forward the Callisto (carbon liquefaction transportation and storage) Mediterranean CO 2 Network integrated CCS project in collaboration with coordinator Air Liquide.

The scheme incorporates the Eni-operated Ravenna CO 2 storage hub offshore/onshore eastern Italy, a co-development with Snam. Phase 1 began late last year. The aim is to develop Italy’s first full capture, transport and storage chain in Italy.

It involves capturing 25,000 metric tons/year of CO 2 per year emitted from Eni’s Casal Borsetti gas power plant for injection into a depleted offshore gas field in the Adriatic Sea. The Italian authorities have awarded a CO 2 storage license.

Phase 2, due to start by 2026, will target storage of 4 MMmt of CO 2 per year, 1 MMmt coming from industrial plants owned by Eni and the remaining 3 MMmt reserved for third-party industrial emitters.

To date, Eni and Snam have signed a letter of intent with four emitters in the Ravenna industrial area.

Further expansions could bring the volumes up to 16 MMmt/year of CO 2 . Captured carbon will be stored in more offshore depleted gas reservoirs in the Adriatic with an estimated capacity to store 500 MMmt.

Callisto aims to develop a CCS value chain in southwest Europe, focusing on decarbonization of the industrial areas, initially in Ravenna and Ferrara, Italy, and the Fos-Marseille Hub in France.

Admission to the PCI projects list will allow the development, once it has passed the ongoing process (expected to be completed in 2024), to be eligible for the Connecting Europe Facility Fund, which supports studies and development of infrastructure for the reception, transport and storage of CO 2 .

Eni aims to transfer its experience in storing gas in depleted fields for decades to repurpose certain upstream facilities into CO 2 storage hubs, to decarbonize both its own and third parties' industrial activities with a fast time to market.

Air Products to Build Largest “Blue” Hydrogen Plant in Europe - ESG Today,"Mon, 06 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzZ3RvZGF5LmNvbS9haXItcHJvZHVjdHMtdG8tYnVpbGQtbGFyZ2VzdC1ibHVlLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLXBsYW50LWluLWV1cm9wZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Industrial gases company Air Products announced today plans for Europe’s largest “blue hydrogen” plant, with a new state-of-the-art carbon capture and carbon dioxide treatment facility at its existing Rotterdam hydrogen production plant, to be built owned and operated by the company.

The facility is expected to be onstream in 2026, and will serve ExxonMobil’s Rotterdam refinery and additional customers via Air Products’ hydrogen pipeline network system. According to Air Products, project is being undertaken as part of long-term agreements with ExxonMobil and the Dutch State.

Edward Dekker Kleijn, Rotterdam Site Manager at ExxonMobil, said:

“We are pleased to build on our collaboration with Air Products to lower our environmental footprint. Carbon Capture and Storage is one of the critical technologies required to achieve the climate goals. This project is a great example of how industry works together to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the Rotterdam port area.”

Hydrogen is viewed as one of the key building blocks of the transition to a cleaner energy future, particularly for industrial and transport sectors with difficult to abate emissions, in which renewable energy solutions such as wind or solar are less practical.

Currently, the vast majority is extracted using fossil fuels, which create pollutants and GHG emissions. Blue hydrogen is produced by converting natural gas into hydrogen and CO2, which is then captured and permanently stored.

Under the new project, Air Products’ carbon capture retrofit will capture CO2 from the company’s existing hydrogen plant and ExxonMobil’s Rotterdam refinery, with the plant connected to Porthos, one of the world’s largest carbon transport and storage projects. Air Products and ExxonMobil are part of a consortium of companies, along with Shell and Air Liquide, selected by the Dutch government to participate in the Porthos project, which recently reached final investment decision approval.

Using the Porthos system, CO2 captured by the new facility will be transported to depleted gas fields in the North Sea, approximately 20 kilometers off the coast, where it will be permanently stored at a depth of more than three kilometers beneath the seabed.

LifeGuard Technologies: Ensuring the safety of hoses for over 30 years - Innovation News Network,"Thu, 16 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlubm92YXRpb25uZXdzbmV0d29yay5jb20vbGlmZWd1YXJkLXRlY2hub2xvZ2llcy1lbnN1cmluZy10aGUtc2FmZXR5LW9mLWhvc2VzLWZvci1vdmVyLTMwLXllYXJzLzM5OTQyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LifeGuard Technologies are committed to ensuring the safety of hoses as their importance continues to grow across industries and in the green revolution.

The safety of hoses is crucial. Gary Howes, Product Manager of hydraulic hose and fittings at Parker Hannifin, said: “The end of a high pressure of petrochemical hose blowing off is the greatest risk we face. This causes the remaining portion of the hose to ‘whip’ about until flow stops and allows the medium being conveyed through the hose to escape.”

“If the medium is a gas its expansion can cause this to be extreme. Failures can result in injuries such as oil injection, burning, fire. There’s also the environmental damage from the escaping medium. Whipping hoses can cause serious injury or death.”

Government mandate for LifeGuard ­Safety Hose Technology

For many years, excess flow valves were identified as the solution for hose failure incidents. In the high-pressure arena, external cable ship-guards were identified as a solution to constrain the dangerous effects of a high pressure hose failure.

On 8 September, 1996, in Sanford, North Carolina, during delivery of propane to a bulk storage facility by an MC 331 bulk transport, more than 35,000 gallons of propane were released. The discharge hose separated from its hose coupling at the delivery end of the hose. Most of the transport’s 9,800 gallons of propane and more than 30,000 gallons from the storage tanks were released. If this quantity of released propane ignited, local authorities estimated that about 125 emergency response personnel could have been injured or killed.

This incident as well as many more in other petrochemical industries all pointed to a fundamental flaw in the fluid transfer system – over reliance on the excess flow valve. This recognition spawned a landmark Rulemaking issued by the United States DOT-RSPA in which they declared formally that excess flow valves are not reliable to address hose failures and new technology – the Passive Safety Hose technology was identified to provide a greater degree of safety and reliability.

Thus the term, passive safety technology was created and codified by the governments of the United States, Canada, Mexico and India around the LifeGuard Safety Hose technology as shutdown equipment that has the capability to shut off the flow of product without human intervention within 20 seconds of an unintentional release caused by complete separation of a delivery hose. This rulemaking marked the first of several important, steps that have since been taken to require LifeGuard Safety Hose technology to address the consequences of transfer line failure by relying upon systems other than excess flow valves in the United States, Canada, Mexico and India.

Who is LifeGuard Technologies?

LifeGuard Technologies is based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It began with Joe Abrams’ work in cryogenics in 1958, and today the company has hoses worldwide in all industries and applications. More than 500,000 hoses with this technology have been sold since its invention including all Tier One and Tier Two gas companies making it the ‘Hose of Choice’ for the industrial and compressed

gas industry.

Joseph Abrams, the late Chairman and Director of Engineering once said: “Most inventions are doomed to rapid extinction, but a few may make evolutionary inventions, and I hope that my technology will save lives for many years to come.”

LifeGuard Technologies is a primarily technology-based company developing hose-based safety systems and promoting applications based upon the experience of its principals in the compressed gas and petrochemical industry. Once called ‘The Uber’ of the hose industry by Vittorio Zurletti, formerly Senior Manager Air Liquide, because of its unique approach to global manufacturing, LifeGuard Technologies recognised the critical need to deliver a consistent product upon a global delivery platform. Following the aggregator model, LifeGuard Technologies has established joint ventures with highly qualified factories and maintains an ownership position in them, utilising their existing infrastructure to manufacture its patented and patent pending design in a logistically advantageous but cost-effective manner.

The history of hose safety

In 1986, Joseph Abrams divested Woodland Cryogenics Inc., from his former company

Woodland Oxygen Supply Company. Woodland Cryogenics was an equipment supplier for the cryogenic and cylinder processing segments and a recognised industry leader in cylinder fill plant equipment design and manufacturing, with field cryogenic services and repair.

The company was also a major equipment supplier to independent welding distributors, Praxair, Linde Gas and Air Liquide in the US and Canada. Working in tandem with the Air Liquide Canada engineering team, including Mohand Abdelli, Joseph Abrams sought to eliminate the use of the external ‘Whip Guard’ cable due to its cumbersome nature and frequent nonuse by cylinder filling personnel to develop the ‘LifeGuard Safety System.’

Since the sale of Woodland, the essence of LifeGuard Technologies mission is, on a global geographical basis, is to provide reliable, readily deployable, and cost-effective hose safety improvements to increase the safety of all operations and facilities for which our hoses are deployed.

With global headquarters and manufacturing sites in the United States, Sweden, Canada, India, Australia and sales office in the United Arab Emirates, LifeGuard Technologies serves customers in more than 78 countries around the world. Since the technology’s inception, LifeGuard Technologies has filed more than seven patents and improved the initial technology to modify its original design, by addressing the possible consequences of heat build-up. This has been done by relocating the internal plunger away from the seat and increasing the internal surface area, thereby eliminating the risk zone of adiabatic compression.

Andy Abrams, Executive Vice President, said: “Accelerating adoption of our patented safety hose system globally and across the compressed gas and petrochemical industry,” is one of the priorities for the company within the next five years. According to Abrams, they have created an international standard for LifeGuard Technologies products by working closely with Linde and Air Liquide in the compressed gas industry and AmeriGas, Indian Oil and others in the LPG industry.

How does the LifeGuard Safety Hose work?

The LifeGuard Safety Hose and LifeGuard Tri-Bolt Breakaway Hose® technology is designed to eliminate the consequences of the hazardous effect of a drive away, coupling separation, hose rupture or failure during fluid or gaseous transfer operations.

All LifeGuard Safety Hose designs, utilise the unique, patented and patent pending design eliminating the potential for disaster through the use of an internal compression spring or monel cable connected to specially designed, normally unseated valve ‘flappers or plungers’ located on each end of the cable. This cables spring-like effect provides thrust in the direction of both ends of the hose, holding the valves open. Should this thrust be eliminated due to coupling ejection, hose stretching or hose separation, the valves release and instantly seat, stopping flow in both directions.

For larger diameter hose requirements (1 ½- 8”) the LifeGuard Tri-Bolt Breakaway Hoses® incorporate a coated Engineered Compression Spring specifically designed for each applications unique flow and pressure. In the case of a Drive-Away, the specifically designed Tri-Bolts will break causing the system to immediately engage and instantly seat stopping the flow in both directions.

Markets and product range

LifeGuard Technologies core business is safety technology. While we have become very well known for our LifeGuard Hydrogen Safety hoses, we serve all industries, applications, and pressures globally. The company has one goal and that is safety. The company’s patented and pending technology is cost-effective and easy to deploy is used on every continent.

The product line encompasses hoses and safety systems from ¼- 8”and can be deployed in any application and pressure.

Jack Fedena, Senior Technical Sales Manager said: “We do not make hoses; we make your hoses safer. We can put our technology on the hoses that you currently use and are comfortable with making the hose in the transfer process, long a cause for concern for safety officers and plant managers an element in a facilities line of defence.”

Existing industry acceptance

The company is in a unique and enviable position; it is positioned to take advantage of the increasing demand for safety by industry and community as well as imminent new safety regulations. In a world increasingly sensitive to safety and facing not only the dangers inherent in product handling, government and industry must also prepare for intentional damage to facilities.

Tier One and Tier Two Gas companies have been adopting the LifeGuard Safety Hose technology for many gaseous applications in cylinder filling and tube trailer offloading including hydrogen.

Dating back to the mid-nineties, several Tier One Gas Companies began adopting passive hose safety in their fill plant hoses. After several validation tests including cycle tests, and many years of experience with LifeGuard Safety Hoses, one has changed their hose cycle life standards. Specifically, all conventional hoses replacement specifications remain similar to other Tier one gas company standards except now LifeGuard Safety Hoses are exempt from cycle life replacement.

This new standard recognises the inherent safety features of LifeGuard Safety Hose passive safety technology when combined with our hose supplier’s hose components and assembly procedures to create a design that can safely remain in service until regular inspection processes identify wear and tear issues requiring removal from service.

A long-standing global supplier of hoses to Air Liquide since 1992, LifeGuard provided and continues to provide nearly a thousand, 1 ½ inch by 14 feet convoluted metallic hoses.

Chad Laflin, Manager of Engineering Technologies at Air Liquide Industrial U.S., who was directly involved in the design and implementation of this project, said: “Not only does this project display Air Liquide’s commitment to safety, it also shows competitors and customers our standard for this application and may entice some movement to adopt a similar standard improving safety across the industry.”

Growth and competition

Since its founding LifeGuard Technologies has consistently refined its product and developed new products for client specific applications. Year on year growth has exceeded 15% for from 2017 through 2023.

Andy Abrams, Executive Vice President, said: “While there is competition, we are the only device that seals itself at both ends but with a controlled breakaway separation to avoid ripping the piping out of the truck or facility. Our compression spring enables us to handle very high flow due to its adjustability. There is no training required you simply replace your existing hoses. There is minimal price difference in most instances with the cost virtually the same as the hose as you are using. When the additional safety and regulatory relief that is unique to us are considered, our technology simply becomes a must have.”

Future expectations

LifeGuard Technologies mission is focused and simple to make the world’s safest hoses. The company expects that the current global environment of safety concerns and environmental awareness will continue to expand.

LifeGuard believes that its core capability resides with our technology, patented and pending, as well as our more than 120 years of experience in the industrial gas and petrochemical industries. To that end, we have focused on the technical development of our products and the establishment of world class assembly facilities. The necessity of geographical accessibility between service provider and the customer has been essential for face-to-face contact in our industries.

LifeGuard Technologies has restricted the production/assembly of its products to facilities that are ‘centers of excellence’, in which specialised production capacity is available for the manufacture of unique quality products. Moreover, LifeGuard Technologies expects to be investing in the development of new, original safety products by means of internal and external forms of cooperation in order to preserve our innovative clout and flexibility.

New applications

Hazards associated with handling gaseous or liquid hydrogen are fire, explosion, and pressure. Hydrogen is easily ignited by open flames, electrical sparks and static electricity. A hose failure can literally be catastrophic. Safety for our workers and our community is our top priority.

Newest products

On 29 September, 2023, LifeGuard Technologies expanded its Hydrogen Safety Hose Product Line with the launch of LifeGuard Vacuum Jacketed Hydrogen/Helium Safety Hose, the cryogenic industry’s first patent pending LifeGuard Vacuum Jacketed Safety Hose specifically designed for liquid hydrogen and helium transfer. The vacuum technology with super insulation and the patented and patent pending LifeGuard Safety Internal Shutoff System precisely provides the insulation, value, quality, and safety required to transport liquid hydrogen.

Andy Abrams, Executive Vice President of LifeGuard Technologies, said: “At a time when the hydrogen industry is on the cusp of massive expansion, it is critical that safety lead the way. Now, liquid hydrogen transfer can have the same technological safety features that our LPG, NH3 and high-pressure hydrogen and atmospheric gases hoses have enjoyed for more than 20 years.”

“We look forward to offering this new hose design to our Compressed Gas and petrochemical customers through our global network of locations helping to drive LifeGuard Safety Hose adoption even further into the hydrogen industry.”

Safety is a key priority for the hydrogen industry, as it is essential for its growth and acceptance as a sustainable energy solution. By understanding and managing the safety hazards associated with hydrogen including the ‘weakest link’ – the transfer hose – the industry can ensure its safe production, storage, transportation, and use in various sectors.

The future of LifeGuard Safety Hose technology

The LifeGuard Safety Hose technology is perfectly positioned with more than 30 years of successful performance in the compressed gas, petrochemical and hydrogen industry, with global delivery platforms in five continents, to see its vision of all hoses used in hazardous gas and liquid transfer to include the LifeGuard Safety Hose technology.

We have always believed that excellence is the gradual result of always striving to do better. LifeGuard hose technology offers gas industry professionals an opportunity to improve process safety in the filling, transportation and customer use of petrochemicals and compressed gas. Being a self-deploying device, single incidents can be snuffed out at the earliest opportunity, without the need for human intervention. This is the optimal additional layer of safety.

Siemens Energy inaugurates Berlin electrolyser factory - reNEWS,"Thu, 09 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vcmVuZXdzLmJpei84OTM2OC9zaWVtZW5zLWVuZXJneS1pbmF1Z3VyYXRlcy1iZXJsaW4tZWxlY3Ryb2x5c2VyLWZhY3Rvcnkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Production plant for PEM stacks will have a capacity of 1GW expanding to 3GW by 2025

An electrolyser gigafactory has been inaugurated in Germany by Siemens Energy and Air Liquide.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Siemens Energy chief executive Christian Bruch and the chief executive of French joint venture partner Air Liquide Francois Jackow pushed the start button for the series production of electrolysers.

Among the guests at the event were also German Economics Minister Robert Habeck, French Industry Minister Roland Lescure and other high-ranking political representatives of the two countries.

With the new factory, Siemens Energy is making electrolysers a mass product, laying the foundation for the ramp-up of the hydrogen economy the company said.

The factory in Berlin will have an annual production capacity of 1GW, which Siemens Energy and Air Liquide expect to ramp to at least 3GW by 2025 with potential for more.

With installed electrolysis capacity of 3GW, an average of 300,000 metric tons of green hydrogen can be produced per year.

Bruch said: ""There is no energy transition without green molecules.

“With today's opening and the start of gigawatt-scale production of electrolysers, we are launching the next step for the commercialisation of this vital technology.

“Now we need to agree on a viable business model with a balanced risk and reward profile to turn the smallest molecule into a big success story.""

At the Siemens Energy site in Berlin the complete infrastructure of an existing production facility and its experienced workforce can be used.

New production lines for the electrolysers were set up on 2000 square metres at a cost of around €30m.

The new factory will supply stacks – the heart of electrolysers – for a wide range of customers, serving the fast-growing market.

These stacks are based on proton exchange membrane (PEM) technology.

Once produced, the assembly of the hardware to be implemented in electrolyser projects will be carried closer to the project sites, contributing further to the cost effectiveness of the solution.

In Europe, a number of low-carbon and renewable large-scale hydrogen projects are already under development.

Near Port-Jérôme, France, the Air Liquide Normand’Hy 200MW electrolyser project is under construction and will be one of the first to be supplied from Siemens Energy's new factory in the framework of the joint venture between Air Liquide and Siemens Energy.

Siemens Energy is also supplying several other large-scale electrolyser projects, such as in Kassø (Denmark) or FlagshipONE (Sweden), which will provide hydrogen for the synthesis of efuels for shipping."

The project forms part of a joint initiative by Sasol and Air Liquide to decarbonise their operations at Sasol’s Secunda complex, in Mpumalanga, through the integration of 600 MW of renewable electricity in the coming years.

The two industrial groups report that they have so far received grid access for 200 MW of renewable electricity.

Sasol produces synthetic fuels and chemicals from coal and gas feedstocks at the complex, where Air Liquide operates the world’s largest oxygen production site.

Sasol, in particular, is coming under increasing social and shareholder pressure to decarbonise its operations, having set a target to cut greenhouse-gas emissions by 30% against a 2017 baseline by 2030.

Mainstream reports that construction will start this year and that the solar PV farm is scheduled to be fully operational in 2025, with the electricity generated to be wheeled through the national grid.

In March, Sasol, which is also pursuing renewables projects separately from Air Liquide, concluded a PPA with the 69 MW Msenge Emoyeni Wind Farm.

The wind project will supply renewable electricity to the Sasolburg site, in the Free State, from the second quarter of 2024, where the group is also piloting the production of green hydrogen."

Air Liquide operates the world’s largest oxygen production site at Sasol’s Secunda operations in South Africa.

This was the third set of PPAs signed by Sasol and Air Liquide after those announced in the first quarter of this year and was the first of the decarbonisation projects to have reached financial close. The solar power plant was scheduled to be operational in 2025. Sasol Energy Business executive vice-president Priscillah Mabelane said they had reached a critical milestone yesterday with their announcement of the first Secunda decarbonisation renewable project reaching financial close. “This is significant progress towards Sasol’s ambition to reduce its absolute scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 30% off a 2017 baseline. Sasol is committed to pursue the renewable procurement as a key lever for reducing GHG emissions, and we have made significant progress in procuring over 600 megawatts,” Mabelane said.

As previously communicated, Sasol and Air Liquide have signed close to 600MW for Secunda of which more than 200MW received grid access from Eskom over the 97.5MW announced by Mainstream Renewable Power. Air Liquide’s CEO of the Africa Middle East & India hub, Nicolas Poirot, said that with their long-term partner Sasol, it had secured massive amounts of renewable energy generation capacity. “This will significantly contribute to the decarbonisation of our operations in Secunda and actively support the development of renewable energies in South Africa, for the benefit of the South African electrical system and ultimately of the South African society in the context of a just transition.”

South African Photovoltaic Industry Association (Sapvia) CEO Dr Rethabile Melamu said the organisation wished to congratulate its member Mainstream Renewable Power on reaching financial close on a 97.5MW solar PV farm, which has 20-year PPAs with Sasol and Air Liquide. “The announcement indicates a maturing of the South African renewable energy and solar PV market and shows the trust placed in the technology by a listed entity signing a private sector power purchase agreement for 20 years and paves the way for other large corporates to follow suit,” Melamu said. The organisation said the local large-scale PV sector would take confidence from the announcement as it built momentum in the large-scale private off-take market.

“Twenty-nine solar PV projects with a combined capacity of 2 200MW have been registered in 2023 with the national energy regulator, equivalent to the total capacity operational due to public procurement.” Melamu said the project would take about 18 months to construct and connect to the grid and would be successful due to project management expertise, a mature and trusted technology and the hard work of the on the ground construction crews. In addition, the Sasol and Msenge Emoyeni Wind Farm agreement for 69MW of renewable energy supply to Sasol’s Sasolburg site reached financial close in early March this year and was currently under construction. The project was scheduled to be fully operational in the second quarter of next year.

Meanwhile, speaking at the opening of European Hydrogen Week on Monday, Higher Education, Science and Technology Minister Dr Blade Nzimande said South Africa had committed to ambitious emission reduction targets, but taking into account its transitional energy mix. “Our estimates indicate that green hydrogen has the potential to reduce 10 to 15% of our domestic emissions and contribute to our nation's long-term energy security,” Nzimande said. The department said it was estimated that the hydrogen economy had the potential to add 3.6% to South Africa’s gross domestic product by 2050 and create more than 370 000 jobs."

Pump Up The Volume: Hydrogen Hits The Big Time - Hydrogen News - Green Hydrogen Report,"Fri, 10 Nov 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmh5ZHJvZ2VuZnVlbG5ld3MuY29tL3B1bXAtdXAtdGhlLXZvbHVtZS1oeWRyb2dlbi1oaXRzLzg1NjE2MDcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Shifting to mass production is key to producing competitive renewable hydrogen. Partnering with Air Liquide, Siemens Energy is scaling production of electrolyzers using standardization and automation aiming to cut the cost of renewable hydrogen down to size. It’s a development that sits at the heart of the energy transition.

Hydrogen has a key role to play on the road to net zero.

Acting as an energy vector, a storage medium, a raw material for synthetic liquid fuels, and as a gaseous fuel able to address emissions from some of the hardest to abate industrial sectors like steel, chemicals, heavy transport and power generation, hydrogen is vital. Unfortunately, so-called green hydrogen generated using renewable energy is currently too expensive to produce. For this reason, the hydrogen market today is dominated by steam reformation of natural gas, it’s essentially a fossil fuel. However, the imperative of climate change has been amplified by other factors such as security of energy supply concerns that have been greatly increased by the war in Ukraine, for example. This has emphasized the importance of developing a cost-effective renewable hydrogen industry and prompted an acceleration of the market.

Despite the growing interest in renewable hydrogen, the cost has remained an impediment to widespread adoption and displacement of the fossil-fuel derived hydrogen that dominates the current market. The joint venture between Siemens Energy and Air Liquide aims to producing industrial volumes of green hydrogen available bringing economies of scale through the mass production of electrolyzers. The move will not only secure access to electrolyzer capacity but crucially get them at the right price without compromising on safety, quality, and reliability.

Hydrogen Scaling production

Scaling renewable hydrogen production to industrial volumes starts with developing a supply chain that can meet global demand and deliver thousands of megawatts of electrolyzer capacity needed every year. By combining their expertise and efforts, Siemens Energy and Air Liquide intend to do just that with the launch of a gigawatt-scale factory in Berlin. The plant, which heavily relies on automation and robotics to produce electrolyzers in bulk, will initially produce 1 GW of Siemens Energy’s Silyzer 300 Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyzer stacks annually. The PEM technology offers a high degree of efficiency and is ideally suited to the variable output that is typical of renewable energy resources. Furthermore, under current plans, this production capacity will increase by at least 1 GW per year, reaching a hefty 3 GW annually by 2025 with a potential for more. In a second step the electrolyzer arrays are being assembled locally, e.g. in the Siemens Energy manufacturing site Muelheim, or in external workshops in the Czech Republic or France or close to future project sites.

Production at the Huttenstrasse facility, located in Berlin’s Moabit district, has just started. The site has so far been known particularly to produce hydrogen-capable gas turbines. The new production line occupies some 2000 m2.

Leveraging Partnerships for Efficient Hydrogen Production

The joint venture expects several benefits, alongside the economies of scale that are translating into a reduction in costs, as has been previously witnessed with renewable energy technologies like wind and solar PV. For example, by partnering with Air Liquide – which is taking a 25.1% equity stake in the JV alongside Siemens Energy’s 74.9% – the gigawatt-scale factory already has a strong business case with a reliable partnership that secures sustained, competitive and reliable product off-take. Both partners able to meet electrolyzer demand arising from their individual portfolios of hydrogen projects.

In addition, in partnering with Air Liquide, Siemens Energy has a strong relationship with a company that has vast experience and deep knowledge of the processes to produce the hydrogen and oxygen, such as hydrogen liquefaction, methanol synthesis, ammonia synthesis, or ammonia cracking.

It is key to long-term success that the Siemens Energy electrolyzer fits the needs of the downstream processes and can also be optimized to better meet those needs in the future. Air Liquide is already working with Siemens Energy electrolyzers deployed at its site in Oberhausen, Germany, in the flagship Trailblazer project. This allows both partners to gather detailed knowledge on how to integrate electrolyzers into an existing plant configuration and learn how to operate the system in combination with existing assets, such as compression and off-take. Sharing know-how, risks and opportunities, the partners aim to rapidly accelerate the transition to affordable renewable hydrogen.

One of the first projects to use stacks from the Berlin multi-gigawatt factory is Air Liquide’s Normand’Hy electrolyzer project. With a capacity of 200 MW, it is the one of the largest PEM electrolyzers currently under development. This project will apply the learnings from Air Liquide’s Trailblazer project in Oberhausen. Other renewable and low-carbon hydrogen projects are also earmarked for development in the Netherlands and elsewhere using the Berlin-produced stacks.

Continuing to cut costs

Within the framework of the partnership, Air Liquide and Siemens Energy have also agreed to dedicate R&D resources to the development of the next generation of electrolyzer technologies. Further efficiency improvements are anticipated, especially given the progress to date.

Siemens Energy started developing hydrogen electrolyzer technology more than a decade ago with a small lab-scale PEM. A commercial product, the Silyzer 200, followed in 2015 with a rated capacity of around 1.25 MW. Although the Silyzer 200 represented a major jump in capacity it was still not suitable for large-scale hydrogen production. That changed with the launch of the Silyzer 300 which has more than 10 times the amount of hydrogen output than the 200 version. Indeed, the Silyzer portfolio scales up by factor 10 every four or five years and sees substantial improvements in efficiency with each generation.

Simultaneously, manufacturing processes have also evolved, from the hand-built Silyzer 100 and 200 to exploring the development of automated manufacturing equipment and implementation of larger scale machines with the launch of the 300. Siemens Energy is also developing manufacturing equipment together with external companies, removing manual processes and increasing automation.

The focus in Berlin is mass production of the existing stacks and a huge step up in production volumes. Increasing production with a factor of 100, within four or five years is only possible in a fully automated large-scale mass production plant of the kind that is being developed in Berlin. Solid investment in manufacturing capacity is enabling the supply chain to invest in capacity growth with confidence too, ramping up from single piece production to mass production in line with stack manufacturing volumes.

In order to cut the specific cost of hydrogen, while mass production of the stacks will take place in Berlin, assembly of the final product will take place closer to the project sites. The Silyzer product contains 24 PEM stacks but built around it are the various ancillaries that are needed for the stacks to operate. These items include the manifolds for the gas, the cooling system, the gas separation system, and the electrical connections among others. In Germany, this stage of assembly will take place at Mülheim but that will change depending on the location of the final project. For the Air Liquide Normand’Hy project, for example, Siemens Energy will work with a French company to produce the skid-mounted electrolyzer array. This approach of working with external partners close to where the final customers are based is key to match the market needs.

Building a hydrogen ecosystem

Reasonably priced and affordable renewable hydrogen derived from renewables is a prerequisite for achieving net zero carbon. It is therefore key for our future. By moving into large-scale mass production, the Air Liquide-Siemens Energy partnership is taking a big step towards a cost-effective hydrogen economy using automation and standardization to build economies of scale. At the same time as volumes soar, demand for the electrolyzer business is also rapidly accelerating, rising from approximately 50 or 60 stacks five years ago and increasing by a factor of 10 this year and another factor of 5 to 10 anticipated over the next few years. By fostering a global ecosystem for electrolysis and hydrogen technology, the joint venture is engineering access to industrial volumes of cost-competitive renewable hydrogen. The challenge is global warming, part of the solution is a gigawatt-scale factory."
