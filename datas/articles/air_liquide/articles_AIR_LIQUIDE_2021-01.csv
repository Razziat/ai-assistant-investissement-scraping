Air Liquide inaugurates the world's largest low-carbon hydrogen membrane-based production unit in Canada - Air Liquide,"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5haXJsaXF1aWRlLmNvbS9ncm91cC9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy1uZXdzLzIwMjEtMDEtMjYvYWlyLWxpcXVpZGUtaW5hdWd1cmF0ZXMtd29ybGRzLWxhcmdlc3QtbG93LWNhcmJvbi1oeWRyb2dlbi1tZW1icmFuZS1iYXNlZC1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLXVuaXQtY2FuYWRh0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide has completed the construction of the world's largest PEM (Proton Exchange Membrane) electrolyzer. Supplied with renewable energy, this unit is now producing up to 8.2 tonnes per day of low-carbon hydrogen in Bécancour, Québec. With this large-scale investment, the Group confirms its long-term commitment to the hydrogen energy markets and its ambition to be a major player in the supply of low-carbon hydrogen.

The new 20 MW PEM electrolyser, equipped with Cummins[1] technology, is the largest operating unit of its kind in the world and will help meet the growing demand for low-carbon hydrogen in North America. Bécancour's proximity to the main industrial markets in Canada and the United States will help ensure their supply of low-carbon hydrogen for industrial use and mobility. The commissioning of this electrolysis unit increases by 50% the capacity of Air Liquide's Bécancour hydrogen production complex.

Compared to the traditional hydrogen production process, this new production unit will avoid the emission of around 27,000 tonnes of CO2 per year, which is equivalent to the emissions of 10,000 cars per year. The choice of Bécancour is based on two attributes of the site: the access to abundant renewable power from Hydro-Québec and the proximity to the hydrogen mobility market in the northeast of the continent.

Susan Ellerbusch, CEO, Air Liquide North America and Group Executive Committee Member:

“The fight against climate change is at the heart of the Air Liquide Group's strategy. The inauguration of the Bécancour site in Canada marks an important step in the implementation of this strategy. With this world’s first, Air Liquide confirms its commitment to the production of low-carbon hydrogen on an industrial scale and its ability to effectively deploy the related technological solutions. Hydrogen will play a key role in the energy transition and the emergence of a low-carbon society.”"

"Air Liquide, TotalEnergies, VINCI and a group of international companies launch the world's largest clean hydrogen ... - Vinci","Sun, 10 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpbmNpLmNvbS92aW5jaS5uc2YvZW4vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvcGFnZXMvMjAyMTEwMDEtMDgwMC5odG3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide, TotalEnergies and VINCI, are combining forces with other large international companies to sponsor the creation of the world’s largest fund exclusively dedicated to clean hydrogen infrastructure solutions. The fund aims to reach 1.5 billion euros and has already secured initial commitments of 800 million euros. Its objective is to accelerate the growth of the clean hydrogen ecosystem by investing in large strategic projects and leveraging the alliance of industrial and financial players.

The clean hydrogen infrastructure fund will invest in the entire value chain of renewable and low carbon hydrogen, in the most promising regions in the Americas, Asia and Europe. It will invest as a partner, alongside other key project developers and/or industry players, in large upstream and downstream clean hydrogen projects. Total commitments to the fund have already reached 800 million euros out of a target of around 1.5 billion euros at signature.

Air Liquide, TotalEnergies and VINCI Concessions have been at the forefront of setting up and aggregating commitments to this clean hydrogen infrastructure fund. As anchor partners, fully committed to low carbon and renewable hydrogen development, each has pledged to invest 100 million euros. The fund will be managed by Hy241, a brand new 50/50 joint venture between Ardian, a world-leading private investment house and FiveT Hydrogen, a clean hydrogen enabling investment platform. The choice of this fund manager allows to merge with their similar initiative and to add Plug Power as an anchor partner, as well as Chart Industries and Baker Hughes joining together.

LOTTE Chemical has also confirmed its intention to participate as anchor investor, and is the first Asian company to join. The fund expects to attract further investments from large financial players, with AXA as anchor investor. Large international industrial players from North America and Europe, which are strongly committed to carbon neutrality, also intend to join the initiative as non-anchor partners, such as Groupe ADP, Ballard, EDF, and Schaeffler.

With solid industrial expertise and significant investment potential, the clean hydrogen infrastructure fund will have a unique capacity to unlock large scale projects under development and accelerate the scaling up of hydrogen markets. With the announced support of public policies and some use of debt financing, the fund should be able to contribute to the development of hydrogen projects with a total value of about 15 billion euros.

A global player in concessions, construction and energy, present in some 100 countries, VINCI is actively committed to Net Zero Emission by implementing an ambitious environmental policy. Its mission is to design, finance, build and operate infrastructure and facilities that contribute to improving daily life and mobility for everyone. Xavier Huillard, Chairman and CEO of VINCI declared: “VINCI is taking concrete action to support the development of clean energy by mobilising all its divisions in concessions, construction and energy, with the aim of actively combating climate change and decarbonising mobility in particular. By launching this investment fund today, hand in hand with other major industrial leaders, we keep moving forward to make green hydrogen a strong lever in achieving our objectives”.

As a pioneer in hydrogen for over 50 years, Air Liquide is convinced that hydrogen is a cornerstone of the energy transition. The Group is providing its unique expertise along the entire value chain, using hydrogen as a clean energy carrier for industrial processes and clean mobility. Benoît Potier, Chairman and CEO of Air Liquide, declared: “Hydrogen has become a central element of the energy transition. The time to act is now, not only as companies on a stand-alone basis, but by joining forces with states, other industrial groups and the financial community. With the creation of this fund, we are demonstrating our leadership to participate in a collective dynamic to build momentum. As Air Liquide, we have already committed to invest approximately 8 billion euros in the low-carbon hydrogen supply chain by 2035. Our objective is to contribute to the development of the entire value chain from low-carbon hydrogen production to end-uses, investing in the necessary infrastructure with storage and distribution projects. Accelerating on Hydrogen development is key to mitigate climate change.”

As a broad energy Company, TotalEnergies’ ambition is to get to net-zero emissions by 2050 together with society for its global business across its production and energy products used by its customers. Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies, commented: “We believe that clean, renewable hydrogen will play a key role in the energy transition, and TotalEnergies wants to be a pioneer in its mass production. We are currently working on several projects, notably to decarbonize the grey hydrogen used in our European refineries by 2030. We are convinced that a collective effort is needed to kick-start the hydrogen sector and take it to scale. We are thus proud to launch and invest in the Clean hydrogen infrastructure fund, which will also give us privileged insights in the sector.”

The hydrogen economy is expected to be key in the fight against climate change. Many countries have initiated hydrogen-related regulations and support schemes to enable clean hydrogen to help decarbonize their economies. Hydrogen offers a solution to decarbonize industrial processes and the mobility sector.

Subject to Hy24’s French Market Authority (AMF) accreditation as an Alternative Investment Fund Manager (AIFM), the platform will be operational in late 2021 and first closing is expected before the end of the year.

HysetCo moves to run 600 hydrogen cabs in Paris - www.electrive.com,"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsZWN0cml2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wMS8yNi9oeXNldGNvLW1vdmVzLXRvLXJ1bi02MDAtaHlkcm9nZW4tY2Ficy1pbi1wYXJpcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris will eventually see 600 fuel cell taxis. The long-running project HysetCo just acquired the cab operator Slota and plans to replace its 600-vehicle diesel fleet with the Toyota Mirai gradually. They also want to install two new hydrogen filling stations this year.

The company has been on the scene. We first reported their efforts in early 2019 when Air Liquide, Idex, Société du Taxi Électrique Parisien (STEP) and Toyota launched the joint venture. Back then, they considered HysetCo a “major landmark” for hydrogen transport and also wanted to further an existing fleet of fuel cell taxis called Hype. The initial aim was for 600 FCEVs to serve Parisians by the end of 2020. This would make also make it “the largest fleet of taxis in the world using energy as a hydrogen as an energy source,” according to the CEO of Toyota France, Frank Marotte.

Fast-forward to today, and there is a slight delay, which they apparently want to address with the new acquisition. On Twitter, AirLiquide claims “target reached” – almost. Fittingly, the Slota fleet includes 600 cabs which HysetCo will replace with Toyota Mirai successively. The exact timeframe is undisclosed but looking at the initial goal, asap seems in order.

STEP president Mathieu Gardies did mention that before he pointed out the “unusual circumstances of 2020”. He then moved on to stress “the quality of our new financial partners and by the renewed support of Air Liquide.”

The acquisition has indeed been made possible by more than €80 million in new funds as new investors joined the JV. Air Liquide has also increased its commitment so that HysetCo and Hype have now raised over €100 million in investment.

Further funding for the infrastructure comes through the federal ADEME agency and the Île-de-France Region and the FCH-JU (Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking). The first new filling station this year will be at Porte de Saint-Cloud, on a Paris City site. The company does not say how many stations are currently live. At the beginning of 2019, there were four, in Paris-Orly, Les-Loges-en-Josas, Pont de l’Alma and Roissy near Charles-de-Gaulle Airport. Overall, HysetCo plans to operate around 20 H2 stations in Paris by 2024.

The current fleet of Hype fuel cell vehicles includes 100 FCEVs. The initiative had first been set up in 2015 on the occasion of the UN COP21 in Paris.

Air Liquide boosts hydrogen production at Quebec facility - CIM Magazine,"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vbWFnYXppbmUuY2ltLm9yZy9lbi9uZXdzLzIwMjEvYWlyLWxpcXVpZGUtYm9vc3RzLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tYXQtcXVlYmVjLWZhY2lsaXR5LWVuL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide announced on Jan. 26 that it has completed construction of the largest 20-megawatt Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolysis unit in the world to generate green hydrogen at its production facility in Bécancour, Quebec.

The site holds four compact pressurized electrolysers developed by Hydrogenics, a Canadian-based company, which was acquired by the American engine manufacturer Cummins in September 2019.

Electrolysers address one of the main issues . Typically, excess energy would be sold off to the market at a loss or left unused, but the PEM electrolysers allow excess energy to be stored and sold at a later date.

The facility’s capacity to produce hydrogen after installing the electrolysis unit has also increased by 50 per cent since beginning commercial operations in October 2020, enabling the production of almost 3,000 tonnes of hydrogen output annually, or 8.2 tonnes of low-carbon hydrogen per day.

""We are at a critical juncture of the energy system transition to one that is more efficient, sustainable, powerful and reliable. And while we have many innovative technologies that can and will be part of the solution, hydrogen is really among the most promising,"" said CEO of Air Liquide North America Susan Ellerbusch in a virtual event celebrating the inauguration of the new unit.

Related: With regulations being written, trials underway and companies considering adoption strategies, hydrogen’s time may finally be here



Green hydrogen is produced by passing an electric current through water, a process called electrolysis, powered by a renewable energy source such as hydroelectricity. Air Liquide Canada president and CEO Bertrand Masselot said the city of Bécancour was strategically chosen to be the home of the new technology because of the abundant availability of renewable energy from Hydro-Quebec, in addition to the city's proximity to the hydrogen mobility market in northeastern North American, which will ensure the supply of low-carbon hydrogen for industrial use and mobility in Canada and the United States.

The demand for hydrogen produced with green energy has been growing rapidly in recent years. Ellerbusch said that this new development marks the acceleration of the global market’s transition to a cleaner economy, with hydrogen at its core.

For its part, the Canadian government recently started rolling out a hydrogen strategy, with the plan to develop and promote hydrogen capture and fuel technology. The plan is meant to be a critical step forward to meet the country’s commitments to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The strategy notes that the mining industry has long been dependent on diesel power for its operations. In order to combat climate change, many mining companies such as Glencore and Anglo American have started trialling hydrogen power at its mines and transitioning to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.

The high cost of producing hydrogen remains a challenge for many companies around the world, but at Bécancour, hydrogen can be produced at competitive prices because of low-cost hydroelectricity production, said Masselot.

“We think that Quebec can really stand out [because] we are lucky to have a lot of water and a lot of renewable energy,"" said Charette.

Regions like Quebec technically have the ability to also export their production of green hydrogen to international markets by liquifying molecules and transporting them long-distance to markets with a renewable energy deficiency. However, according to Masselot, even though the company has transported hydrogen to different markets in the past, for the Bécancour unit, logistics such as economics and the environment must be considered as well. For that reason, he said, the Bécancour production will remain local and serve its designated North American market."
