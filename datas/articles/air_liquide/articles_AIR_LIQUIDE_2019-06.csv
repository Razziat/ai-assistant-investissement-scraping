FMC moves N.J. research staff to expanded R&D center in Delaware - The Philadelphia Inquirer,"Wed, 26 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9wZXN0aWNpZGUtZm1jLXJlc2VhcmNoLWpvYnMtbW92ZWQtc3Vic2lkeS1jaGVtaWNhbC1sYWJzLWV4cGVyaW1lbnQtMjAxOTA2MjYuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Portion of FMC's Stine Research Center near Newark, Del., which the company plans to expand. Built by DuPont Co., it was acquired by FMC at the behest of the European Commission, to strengthen competition for Corteva, the new pesticide company spun off from Dow Chemical and the DuPont Co.

FMC Corp., the Philadelphia pesticide-maker, has moved its Princeton-area research and development group to a 515-acre former DuPont Co. experimental farm near Newark, Del., where it plans to spend $50 million over the next three years on an expanded R&D headquarters.

The upgraded FMC labs and offices will also help house a larger staff of FMC’s former DuPont researchers, in a so-far unfinished facility that DuPont stopped building in a cost-cutting move before its 2017 merger with Dow Chemical Co.

“They left us with the shell of a beautiful building -- concrete walls and roof,” plus new adjoining greenhouses, FMC spokesperson Ken Gedaka said. “That’s a fantastic facility. We need that space.” The money will also pay for research equipment, engineering, infrastructure, and utilities.

Most important, FMC kept DuPont’s Stine Research Center workforce -- 360 science and engineering staff, 150 contract workers, and 50 facilities employees -- and its experimental farm, with fields for soybeans, corn and other grains, vegetables, and tree-fruit orchards where chemicals and other controls can be tested on apples, peaches, and other crops.

Leading up to the new center, FMC last year transferred 45 of the 90 staff at its Ewing Township, Mercer County, N.J., research facility to the Delaware site. An additional 15 New Jersey staff retired or quit. And 30 have stayed on in New Jersey in office roles -- including regulatory compliance and support -- as the research moves to Newark, Gedaka said. The company also plans 13 new research positions in Delaware over the next three years.

State taxpayers sweetened the deal. Delaware’s Council for Development Finance voted two grants from the Delaware Strategic Fund, including $1.5 million for capital expenses, plus $142,000 as a “performance grant,” with both sums contingent on FMC’s keeping and adding the promised jobs.

DuPont scientists had feared DuPont’s 2017 merger with Dow Chemical would force a shutdown at the Stine office, lab, and experimental farm complex, and that the company would move some staff to larger labs in the Midwest, and lay off others as DuPont did at its main Experimental Station near Wilmington. (A reorganized DuPont Co. has since spent more than $200 million updating the station, though some of its businesses are now up for sale.)

But the European Commission found that the Dow-DuPont merger, along with the contemporary Monsanto-Bayer and ChinaChem-Sygenta marriages, would reduce pesticide research and boost prices. The commission’s antitrust office directed DuPont to sell part of its business and the Delaware research site to a rival that could keep the industry competitive.

FMC agreed to take over the Stine site, plus the DuPont insecticides, which include Rynaxypyr (it kills moths and caterpillars that eat fruits and vegetables) and Cyazypyr (kills citrus flies). . In exchange, FMC swapped its food and drug additives unit to DuPont. Jubilant scientists cheered FMC chief executive Pierre Brondeau as their work’s preserver.

FMC’s research effort is headed by Kathleen Shelton, chief technology office and vice president, who joined FMC as part of the deal with DuPont.

After the merger, Dow and DuPont pesticide and genetically modified seed businesses were combined. At the end of May, they were spun off as Corteva, a new, publicly traded company, which locally includes a headquarters office near Wilmington and a research building adjoining FMC’s Stine site. DuPont also kept one building near the complex. On Wednesday Corteva said it would give $1 billion to its investors in a share repurchase program, in hopes of boosting its share price.

“FMC is making a significant new investment in Delaware, and in a campus that has long been a center of world-class biotechnology and agri-science research,” said Delaware Gov. John Carney in a statement. Newark, near the University of Delaware, is also home to research facilities for Siemens, Air Liquide, W.L. Gore, and other multinational companies.

Worldwide, FMC plans to spend “nearly $2 billion” in R&D over the next four years, said FMC president Mark Douglas in a statement. The company also built a biology and fermentation research lab in Denmark recently, and counts a total of 23 research stations around the world, to be headquartered at Stine."

Hydrogen-powered cars in Denmark - DW (English),"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR3LmNvbS9lbi9kcml2aW5nLWEtaHlkcm9nZW4tcG93ZXJlZC1jYXItaW4tZGVubWFyay9hLTQ5MTcyNzY50gFKaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuZHcuY29tL2VuL2RyaXZpbmctYS1oeWRyb2dlbi1wb3dlcmVkLWNhci1pbi1kZW5tYXJrL2EtNDkxNzI3Njk?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hydrogen-powered cars are still few and far between. In Europe, Denmark stands out for having the most dense network of stations for the CO2-free fuel. Oliver Ristau looks at whether such cars are suitable for daily use.

The fuel pump display stops at 3.8 kilograms, that's all the tank can accommodate on top of what was left inside. There's a batch of fuel cells under the hood. A tank filled with the maximum capacity of some 6 kilograms of hydrogen will take you about 600 kilometers (370 miles) in a Nexo car from South Korean automaker Hyundai.

The gas was pumped into the tank at minus 40 degrees Celsius (coincidentally, also minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit), resulting in a thin layer of ice on the pump nozzle.

In Aarhus, on the eastern coast of the Danish mainland, a kilogram of hydrogen costs 107.5 kroner (€14.4, $16.3) and thus a lot more than the €9.5 you would have to pay for the same amount of hydrogen over in Germany.

Whoever wants to refuel their hydrogen-powered cars in Denmark needs to register upfront with gas station equipment provider NELHydrogen. You'll get a key plus PIN code to unlock the nozzle at the pumps. The bill will be sent to you later.

Denmark currently has eight hydrogen fuel stations. Measured against the country's overall population, the nation thus has Europe's most dense network. Among the operators are Danish petroleum company OK and France's Air Liquide.

Hydrogen from the container

Some 70 kilometers north of Aarhus, the French run a hydrogen production facility — white containers with a corrugated surface and grey pipes can be seen from afar.

""In principle, we're using a simple procedure,"" says Soren Bjerregaard Pedersen, chairman of project partner Hydrogen Valley. ""The only thing you need is water and electricity, and then we get hydrogen and oxygen in these containers.""

Soren Pederson is standing near an electrolyzer that plays an essential role in the production process Image: DW/O. Ristau

In a metal box, there's an electrolyzer with a capacity of 1.2 megawatts that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. It can produce 500 kilograms of hydrogen per day, with the oxygen just channeled into the outside air.

In a car's fuel cells, hydrogen reacts with oxygen to generate electricity. There are no harmful emissions in the process. The only waste product is water, which escapes though a kind of exhaust pipe.

Of course, fuel cell cars are only really green when the fuel itself is produced with renewables. Pederson is planning exactly that. ""We want to produce hydrogen when there's a surplus of wind energy available,"" he explains. ""That way we can get green electricity into other sectors of the economy such as transportation.""

More grey than green

For the time being, that's a concept for the future as the electrolyzer at Hobro gets its electricity from the grid at any time, making the hydrogen produced more grey than green — in Denmark's electricity mix, renewables account for 50%. ""We're working on an algorithm to produce only when prices are low,"" says Pedersen.

That would most likely be the case during the night and on weekends when electricity demand is low in the country, but wind turbines work at full speed and sometimes have to be switched off so as not to overload the grid. That excessive electricity could be put to good use when producing hydrogen at the Hobro facility.

Transporting hydrogen is no plain sailing, but the Danes have perfected the business Image: DW/O. Ristau

Green hydrogen would then be something like stored renewable energy that could help the climate as it would be different from conventional hydrogen used in industry and produced on the basis of natural gas and chloric gas.

Hydrogen production makes sense in the vicinity of those willing to buy it as transporting the volatile gas is not really efficient.

Pederson is standing in front of a hydrogen trailer where gas cylinders form a pyramid-like structure and are filled via a magnitude of pipes and valves. A truck gets the gas to the nearby fuel station in Aalborg.

Such a trailer can hold no more than 600 kilograms of hydrogen, at a pressure of no more than 220 bar. Using a higher pressure would be complicated and expensive. Liquefied hydrogen would consume less space, but for that the substance would have to be cooled down to minus 250 degrees Celsius, and that would cost a lot of energy.

Hydrogen taxis in Copenhagen

The most important customer for the Hobro facility is metalworking company Sintex, which belongs to Danish pump-producing firm Grundfos. It gets the hydrogen through pipelines. Also, there are big salt domes in the Northern Jutland region. ""They could serve as potential hydrogen storage facilities,"" Pedersen explains.

The number of hydrogen buyers has been going up steadily in Denmark in recent years. Copenhagen now has a fleet of 20 hydrogen-powered taxis. There are not yet enough such cars available on the market. Besides Hyundai, there's only Toyota offering fuel cell cars.

The author tested Denmark's hydrogen fuel stations in May. Following the explosion of such a station in Norway on Monday, Denmark's hydrogen stations have also been closed temporarily."

According to H2 Mobility, four stations in Germany are affected by this measure.

+ + Kindly see our update below ++

The explosion in Norway took place on Monday around 5:30 pm at the Uno-X station in the Oslo suburb of Sandvika. While one was injured on-site, according to police reports, two people were treated for minor injuries due to airbags deploying in their car nearby. Uno-X installed the hydrogen fuelling station in Norwegian Sandvika in 2016. The station includes on-site hydrogen production via solar power.

Germany has a total of 60 hydrogen refuelling stations, the four of these that are supplied by Nel are now closed for the time being. H2 Mobility Deutschland issued a statement: “For H2 Mobility, the safety of our customers and the station staff is the top priority. For this reason, we took all stations of the manufacturer Nel in Germany off the grid on 10 June as a preventive measure.” H2 Mobility Deutschland is a joint venture from hydrogen heavyweights Air Liquide, Daimler, Linde, OMV, Shell and Total with the task of accelerating the expansion of the hydrogen infrastructure in Germany.

The Norwegian site that suffered the explosion included a containerised, pressurised alkaline electrolyser that produces hydrogen in part from solar power. In a statement about the explosion, Nel explained, “It is too early to say anything about the root cause of the incident. Nel currently has expert personnel on the scene and is actively contributing to the ongoing formal investigation. In addition, Nel has engaged fire and explosion safety consultants from Gexcon, who are on site and taking an active role to provide an independent incident report.”

Vice President Consultant of Gexcon AS, Geirmund Vislie, said that “Based on what we have seen at the site, we can conclude that neither the electrolyser nor the dispenser used by customers had anything to do with this incident. We will continue to analyse the other components of the site to further narrow down the source.”"

Putting wine on ice - gas's role in winemaking - FOOD Magazine - Australia,"Fri, 07 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2RtYWcuY29tLmF1L3B1dHRpbmctd2luZS1vbi1pY2UtZ2Fzcy1yb2xlLWluLXdpbmVtYWtpbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The main hero and villain in the wine-making process is oxygen. Generally, the use of various gases in wine production is necessary to negate the destructive nature of oxygen. Gavin Hall, Air Liquide’s sales representative for food and wine in South Australia, said this is where his company’s expertise comes to the fore.

“The management of oxygen in all the wine making processes is paramount to the industry,” he said. “This is because oxygen is what defines the quality of the wine and its organoleptic properties.”

Throughout the production process, the wine itself is subject to various oxidation processes. A certain degree of oxidation is necessary, but direct contact with oxygen has a detrimental effect on the quality of the final product. It is possible to control how oxygen interacts with the wine by using a variety of different gases. All wineries have to use gases to control the intake of oxygen. These gases include nitrogen, carbon dioxide (CO2) argon and sulphur dioxide.

Hall said there are eight stages in which gases are involved in the processing of wine.

Stage 1

The first stage is during the harvesting and transport of grapes from the field to vineyard/winery. In this stage, the crushed grapes start getting in contact with oxygen in the air. It is important to negate that contact but it is difficult to achieve, which is why there is a need to lower the temperature in order to slow down the oxidation process, said Hall.

“As soon as the grape juice comes in contact with oxygen, the fermentation starts, as does the oxidation process. What you want to do is lower the temperature of the grapes,” said Hall. “Because the lower the temperature the slower the oxidation process.”

In this stage CO2 is mainly used in the form of dry ice. “In Australia, compared to Europe, most wineries don’t use this cooling process due to the initial phase, they usually try to process the grapes as soon as possible,” said Hall.

Stage 2

Once the grapes are crushed, the pressing process allows for the production of clarified juice, which is transferred to different tanks to ferment. Winemakers need to displace the air from empty vessels into empty pipes before transferring the wine to ensure there is no residual oxygen. This is called purging.

“When you need to purge the tank,” said Hall, “you utilise an inert gas to flush out the remaining liquid or air under a certain pressure.”

Nitrogen is mainly used in this stage. The process of purging is done by building slight overpressure with nitrogen in the tank, or in the pipeline. The wine maker is stopping the oxygen from coming in contact with the grape juice that has just been crushed out of the grapes.

“You are basically displacing the oxygen from the air that has already come in contact with the juice,” said Hall. “You’re using nitrogen under pressure to purge and transfer juice within the tanks.”

Stage 3

Then comes what is called tank inerting. This encompasses blanketing the surface of the wine tank after the juice has been collected.

“You are blanketing the surface with a protective layer of gas during the storage, or when you are emptying the tank,” said Hall. “By doing this to the tank, you prevent oxidation.”

The gas used can be nitrogen, CO2, or a mixture of the two. Vintners can also use argon, but that can be a little more expensive. In Australia, tank inerting is very important, and it is common to do it with dry ice.

“Using dry ice is preferred by winemakers because it’s practical, and they can actually see it and it’s a bit cheaper,” said Hall.

“You scoop it into the wine tank. Because CO2 is heavier than air, it creates a layer at the bottom of the tank blanketing the wine, thus preventing oxygen contact.”

Stage 4

Winemakers are constantly measuring the dissolved oxygen in the wine. Depending on the wine being made, some vintners do what is called deoxygenation which consists of stripping out the excess oxygen that is dissolved in the wine.

“For this process you would use nitrogen,” said Hall. “By injecting nitrogen in the form of tiny bubbles into the wine, you are forcing the dissolved oxygen into the gas phase, and then the gas is vented out of the tank.”

Depending on the type of wine that is made, vintners need a certain amount of dissolved oxygen. It is one of the key criteria to produce quality wine.

Step 5

The next step, also using nitrogen, consists of mixing or homogenising. Nitrogen is bubbled at the bottom of the tank. When the bubbles raise to the surface, they are mixing the various products together.

“That is why it is called mixing,” said Hall. “This comes into effect when wine makers need to homogenise the wine they are making. It avoids oxygen pick up.”

Bubbling nitrogen is also used during must lifting process but this time during the fermentation. This process brings up all the dense solids that have accumulated at the bottom of the tank.

The benefit of must lifting using gas is that it saves times.

Step 6

Bottle inerting is the next step. This means that when the wine is being bottled, gas is already being used. Like most of the other steps, it is all about minimising the amount of oxygen in the wine.

For this step, it is possible to use CO2 or nitrogen, or a mixture of both. Every bottling line in a winery has filling machines equipped with gas injection. The decision on what type of gas is to be used depends on the type of wine that is being made.

“Most winemakers use nitrogen to apply counter pressure in the bottles to purge the oxygen before filling them with wine,” said Hall. “The oxygen is eliminated inside the bottle, then you fill them with wine.”

The second step in the bottling line is the headspace of the bottle. After the bottle has been filled, there is a gas injection point, which is filling up the headspace of the bottle after the wine has been put into the bottle.

Step 7

Depending on the wine and oxygen level of the tank, some winemakers might use oxygen in the different steps of the winemaking process. This is called oxygen enrichment.

“The winemaker reintroduces oxygen to help maintain the yeast activity in the wine to minimise the risk of stuck fermentation and the production of undesirable sulphides,” said Hall. “Oxygen is not always bad in the winemaking process. This is a controlled situation. You’re not putting wine in contact with air, you’re injecting oxygen in micro doses. The yeast works on oxygen. The simple process of wine making is that you have the sugars in the grapes and then the sugars become alcohol, or ethanol in this case. This process is using oxygen to transform the sugars into ethanol. What you don’t want to do, is put in too much oxygen. Then the alcohol becomes oxidised. You need to control the amount of oxygen you put in the wine.”

Step 8

In the case of still wines, the CO2 level is usually adjusted before bottling, according to Hall. Winemakers can measure the level of CO2 that is dissolved in the wine and bubble nitrogen if it is too high or dissolve CO2 if it is too low. In the case of sparkling, this adjustment is brought about to carbonisation of the wine.

“Now you have the wine that is ready,” said Hall. “Oxygen is the one that creates the magic. It is the management of oxygen that is important and you need it to be controlled at all steps of the process. It is a critical thing for winemakers. An excess of oxygen is bad. You want to avoid direct contact with air.”

If winemakers are thinking of using the gas suite offered by Air Liquide, they come in three different modalities.

For small wineries they come in gas cylinders. For medium- to large-sized installations, the gases are supplied in bulk via big tanks. For big wineries, Air Liquide can install and operate a nitrogen generator onsite."

Mission: to shed light on the causes of the incident and propose measures to prevent future disaster.

The Commission is composed of a President (Minister of Water and Energy -Minee), ten members from the Ministry of Water, the Ministry of Mines, the Ministry of the Environment, the State Secretariat in charge of the Gendarmerie, the National Security and the General Directorate for External Research. Two rapporteurs come from the Ministry of Territorial Administration.

Once fire causes are known, the think tank will establish responsibilities, and evaluate how fire consequences can be overcome by making relevant proposals. Investigation report is to be sent to the Prime Minister within 30 days starting from the date of signature of the Presidential decree (July 10).

As a reminder, in the aftermath of the disaster, the ministry of communications reported that “first information available suggests that the fire was an accident.” This contradicts an assumption that it was the action of separatists.
