It places Sustainable Development at the heart of its strategy and combines financial and extra-financial performance. With a strong business model which has proven its resilience, with its innovation capacity and its technological knowhow, the Group is particularly well positioned to continue its growth trajectory while contributing to respond efficiently to major economic, environmental and societal challenges.

Benoît Potier, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Air Liquide group, stated :

“ In a world transformed by the covid epidemic, and marked by a geopolitical crisis whose dimension of humanitarian disaster is overwhelming, we have to act today but also keep preparing the future. With ADVANCE, financial performance as well as environmental and societal performances are combined in our objectives. For Air Liquide, building the future means delivering strong financial results, as it is a condition to our durability and our ability to invest for the future ; but it also means to act as a leader in decarbonization of the industry, to promote progress through technological innovation and to act for all. With ADVANCE, Air Liquide is opening a new chapter of its history by linking inseparably growth and sustainable future “.

To achieve a comprehensive performance, ADVANCE is structured around four priorities :

1 - To deliver a strong financial performance

With ADVANCE, Air Liquide is taking action today while preparing the future. It is rising up to an ambitious challenge : maintain its growth momentum while pursuing its CO2 emission reduction targets and investing in the markets of the future.

Three objectives define our ambition when it comes to performance :

An acceleration in sales growth reaching a pace of 5 to 6% on average per year [1] .

reaching a pace of on average per year . A return on capital employed (ROCE) of more than > 10 % starting from 2023.

(ROCE) of more than > starting from 2023. A reduction of our CO2 emissions in absolute terms starting around 2025.

To achieve this, we will rely on the optimization of our capital resources and on the improvement of our operating margin. The latter will improve by more than +160 bps over 4 years (2022-2025)[2], by acting on several levers: a dynamic pricing policy, regular efficiencies and an active management of our portfolio of activities.

At the same time, investment decisions will be increased to a record level, to reach about 16 billion euros over the 2022-2025 period, half of the industrial investments being dedicated to the energy transition[3]. On average, the annual amount of industrial decisions increases by + 45 %[4].

2 - To decarbonize the planet

With ADVANCE, Air Liquide confirms its leadership in the decarbonization of the industry and in the emergence of a low-carbon society in which hydrogen plays a decisive part.

Air Liquide has today (22nd March) outlined ambitions to increase investment decisions to a record high, cut a third of its emissions and accelerate its sales growth by 5-6% in its new strategic plan for 2025.

Titled ADVANCE, the plan focuses on four key priorities of financial performance, decarbonisation, technological innovation and actively engaging with stakeholders, customers and shareholders.

Decarbonisation is a prominent focus for the industrial gas giant throughout its ADVANCE plan. Within its commitment, Air Liquide states that half of its industrial investments will be dedicated to the energy transition, confirms that hydrogen will play a decisive part in its business, and re-emphasises ambitions to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.

Efforts pivoted towards decarbonisation are projected to future proof the company as they both showcase how clean energies can be utilised in the industrial gas sector and align with wider targets set by various governments and industry personnel."
Air Liquide and Eni to cooperate for the decarbonization of hard-to-abate industries in Europe - Air Liquide,"Mon, 21 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5haXJsaXF1aWRlLmNvbS9ncm91cC9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy1uZXdzLzIwMjItMDMtMjEvYWlyLWxpcXVpZGUtYW5kLWVuaS1jb29wZXJhdGUtZGVjYXJib25pemF0aW9uLWhhcmQtYWJhdGUtaW5kdXN0cmllcy1ldXJvcGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide and Eni have entered into a collaboration agreement aimed at assessing decarbonization solutions in the Mediterranean region of Europe, focused on hard-to-abate industrial sectors. The two companies join forces combining their well-established expertise and know-how to enable CO2 capture, aggregation, transport and permanent storage.

Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) represents one of the fundamental tools in the decarbonization process, especially for the most carbon-intensive industrial sectors, and will play a key role in achieving the important emission reduction targets set at European level as part of the Green Deal.

Within the framework of the agreement, Air Liquide and Eni will collaborate to identify clusters of hard-to-abate industries in this geographic area and will define the best possible configuration to develop a large-scale CCS program.

In particular, Air Liquide will develop competitive CO2 abatement solutions, leveraging on its ongoing CCS initiatives in Northern Europe and on its innovative proprietary technology CryocapTM able to capture up to 95% of CO2 emissions from industrial facilities. Eni, leveraging on its experience in gas fields exploitation and management, will identify the most suitable permanent CO2 storage locations in the Mediterranean sea.

Pascal Vinet, Senior Vice President, a member of Air Liquide Executive Committee, supervising Europe Industries, said :

“We are pleased to cooperate with Eni in this important decarbonization initiative and leverage our expertise in CO2 management to concretely contribute to the reduction of industrial carbon emissions in Europe. Supporting the decarbonization of the Industry is one of the strategic pillars of Air Liquide, which is committed to addressing the urgency of climate change and reach carbon neutrality by 2050.”

H2 Mobility to increase hydrogen refuelling network | electrive.com - www.electrive.com,"Tue, 29 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsZWN0cml2ZS5jb20vMjAyMi8wMy8yOS9oMi1tb2JpbGl0eS10by1pbmNyZWFzZS1oeWRyb2dlbi1yZWZ1ZWxsaW5nLW5ldHdvcmsv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In Germany, the government-funded hydrogen filling station operator H2 Mobility has received an investment of 110 million euros to enable its next phase of growth. The primary investor is the French finance company Hy24. The expansion goals are accompanied by a focus on hydrogen-powered commercial vehicles of all sizes.

Hy24 is contributing 70 million euros, while the remaining 40 million euros will come from existing shareholders, which includes Air Liquide, Daimler Truck, Hyundai, Linde, OMV, Shell, and TotalEnergies. Hy24 is a merger of Ardian, Europe’s largest private investment house, and the investment fund FiveT Hydrogen. Their common goal is to scale up and thus commercialise hydrogen mobility by accelerating the expansion of filling stations.

H2 Mobility says that the new shareholder comes “just in time for the start of the market ramp-up of light and medium hydrogen commercial vehicles.” While H2 Mobility CEO Nikolas Iwan also sees the investment of an external financial investor as an “important confirmation of our course”.

Hy24 CEO Pierre-Etienne Franc explained in an interview with our German colleagues at electrive.net that: “We see great market potential in Germany and Europe, that’s why we are investing right now to continue the expansion in parallel with the market premieres of various hydrogen commercial vehicles.” He continued, “We are an independent investor and make our decisions on that basis. We are not an industrial company. With our financing, we pursue long-term, profit-oriented interests with effective impact in the energy transition.”

Hydrogen filling station capacity to be increased fivefold

The expansion plan that has just been made possible by this latest investment round envisages increasing the current number of just under 100 hydrogen filling stations in Germany to up to 300 by 2030. While these goals do not sound not particularly ambitious, these figures have a different background: H2 Mobility primarily wants to significantly increase the capacity of the sites. Instead of the previous 200 kilogrammes of hydrogen per day, the larger stations are designed for one tonne of H2. Since existing sites are also to be retrofitted, the tank capacity will increase significantly more than the expansion to 300 sites would suggest.

In addition, “selected existing sites are to be retrofitted as needed” with the 350-bar technology, which will allow trucks and buses to refuel there. However, the fuel cell cars that some of the earlier stations were geared towards operating at 700 bar. At many locations, both were possible, but at some, only 700 bar car refuelling was possible – since, in the past, H2 Mobility has been fixated on cars rather than hard-to-decarbonise sectors such as long-haul, heavy-duty transport.

“The focus at the moment is on hydrogen commercial vehicles, from vans to trucks,” says Iwan. “That’s why we are also retrofitting existing locations to also offer refuelling at 350 bar if it is not yet available. At the same time, we are keeping the door open for the passenger car sector.”

H2 fuel cell commercial vehicles or cars?

When the H2 Mobility managing director talks about fuel cell cars, he alludes primarily to BMW’s plans. According to information from mid-March, the company wants to cover “an increasing share in the drive mix” by hydrogen fuel cells from the second half of the decade. Currently, the iX5 Hydrogen is to go into small series production later this year. Possible production models with fuel cells from BMW have not yet been confirmed. The two other carmakers with fuel cell passenger cars, Hyundai and Kia, also currently have only one passenger car with the technology in their programme but use this same fuel cell technology (partly through cooperation agreements) in numerous commercial vehicles and hard-to-decarbonise applications.

To support large-scale production, BMW recently called for a denser network of 700-bar filling stations every 100 kilometres along the motorway by 2027 instead of every 150 kilometres. However, with a view to the vehicles announced in the near future, Alexander Iwan believes it is right to also spend money on 350-bar technology.

Which kind of fuel cell technology?

Incidentally, the fact that Daimler Truck, one of the shareholders in H2 Mobility, openly advocates the use of liquid hydrogen, i.e., hydrogen cooled to -253 degrees Celsius, instead of gas stored under pressure, does not worry Iwan. “It is a great advantage that Daimler Truck is one of our shareholders, so we are constantly in close exchange about different technologies and can react early,” says the managing director. Daimler is also setting its sights on conventional fuel cell technology. In spring of 2020, Daimler Truck and the Volvo Group announced a joint venture to develop and build fuel cells for heavy-duty commercial vehicles, while Daimler is manufacturing both battery-electric and hydrogen fuel cell trucks in its factory in Wörth.

For H2 Mobility, the new locations will certainly also close some gaps on the map, yet the company wants to focus primarily on regions with high demand. This should not only shorten the distances for companies with H2 vehicles in their fleets but, above all, offer reliability thanks to alternatives in the region since reliability is essential for corporate customers.

Korean Air embarks on more major green initiatives - Airline Ratings,"Sun, 06 Mar 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyYXRpbmdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2tvcmVhbi1haXItZW1iYXJrcy1tYWpvci1ncmVlbi1pbml0aWF0aXZlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In preparing for the future of carbon-neutral aviation, Korean Air has embarked on yet another green project to pioneer the Korean hydrogen fuel infrastructure.

In February, Korean Air signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Incheon International Airport Corporation (IIAC), Airbus, and Air Liquide to cooperate on supplying aviation hydrogen fuel and developing relevant infrastructure.

The MOU is aligned with Airbus’ aim to develop the world’s first zero-emission hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft by 2035 and confirms Korean Air as an active participant in welcoming this alternative energy paradigm shift.

The MOU paves way for the stakeholders to cooperate in various fields, from developing hydrogen infrastructure at airports, establishing a roadmap for introducing hydrogen, to ground handling logistics.

Korean Air will also focus its expertise on overall operational activities, including ground handling planning, maintenance, and flight operations, and IIAC on research and development of airport facilities. Airbus and Air Liquide will analyze domestic demand for hydrogen-powered aircraft, and establish a roadmap for the introduction of hydrogen fuel, respectively.

“This MOU will be a starting point for the Korean domestic aviation industry to systemize a hydrogen supply chain system and infrastructure development, where the introduction of hydrogen as an alternative fuel has been slow in relative comparison to other industries,” said Mr. Soo Keun Lee Executive Vice President and Chief Safety & Operation Officer, Korean Air.

Last year, Korean Air signed an MOU with Hyundai Oilbank to manufacture and promote the application of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and also partnered with SK Energy to purchase carbon-neutral jet fuel to be used on the Korean domestic network. In addition, the airline’s introduction of Airbus A220-300 to its fleet will reduce carbon emission per seat by 25 percent compared to existing models of similar capacity, demonstrating its commitment to environmental awareness.

Korean Air is committed to various means of carbon emissions reduction to achieve carbon neutrality, and also to the successful development of the Korean domestic hydrogen energy sector.

Korean Air is actively participating in the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), and introducing eco-friendly and high-efficient aircraft.

In 2017, Korean Air became the first Korean airline to use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) while in June last year, the airline also partnered with Hyundai Oil Bank to develop a foundation for biofuel manufacturing and its usage.

In 2019, Korean Air replaced single-use plastics such as straws, coffee stirrers, and cups with eco-friendly paper products, and has also conducted tree planting activities in Mongolia and China’s Kubuqi Desert.

Korean Air has also been working to improve its environmental, social, and governance (ESG) management, and established an ESG committee, which reviews its management strategies focusing on ESG."

Just as the United Nations has made gender equality one of its 17 Sustainable Development Goals, we have made it one of the pillars of our growth strategy. ""Equal opportunities for women and men isn't something you can order; it's mainly about changing behaviors. Air Liquide is working on biases and prejudices to remove barriers and promote a culture of inclusion,"" says Dana Allen, Leadership and Diversity Program Director. ""By leveraging our differences, we can create more sustainable and innovative solutions to the major challenges facing society"".

During the week of March 8th, we wanted to recognize and encourage the inspiring women at Air Liquide who are working for a sustainable future. To mark the occasion, Air Liquide held an internal webinar led by Fabienne Lecorvaisier, Executive Vice President notably in charge of Sustainable Development, on the United Nations theme ""Women & Sustainability"", and launched a ""Post-Her"" challenge on the Group’s internal social network. The goal? Highlight the women of Air Liquide who are committed to pushing forward!

Promoting women's access to careers in industry and science

The goal is also to raise awareness of these differences and continuously improve our HR processes, including recruitment, career management and wage policy. Additionally, there are a whole host of local actions carried out at Air Liquide's entities around the world to increase gender diversity within their teams: events in schools to encourage young women to take up scientific studies, leadership training, mentoring programs and more.

""Women's access to professions in industry and science, which are still predominantly male, is a key issue. Air Liquide believes in improving their access and devotes resources to it, which benefits everyone,"" emphasizes Edith Lemieux, Director of the Air Liquide University & HR Transformation Projects. We strongly encourage women to build their careers at Air Liquide and have set a specific target that 35% of engineers and managers within the Group should be women by 2025.

Joining Air Liquide means being able to take concrete and useful steps towards a sustainable society. Learn about the stories of Inès, Marisol and Koudedja, who share their career path within the Group and speak about their desire to change the world. This strong commitment is supported by Air Liquide and is reflected in the definition of ambitious Sustainable Development Goals."
Pure delight for new venture at Longford - Gippsland Times,"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdpcHBzbGFuZHRpbWVzLmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzLzIwMjIvMDMvMTUvcHVyZS1kZWxpZ2h0LWZvci1uZXctdmVudHVyZS1hdC1sb25nZm9yZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Construction has officially commenced on a new CO2 Purification Plant at Longford.

The structure will be built within the grounds of the existing Gas Conditioning Plant to capture and store excess carbon-dioxide.

The announcement was made at a sod-turning ceremony last Friday morning at the same site by representatives from ExxonMobil and Air Liquide, who will jointly be constructing the new plant.

ExxonMobil Australia chair Dylan Pugh spoke at the event, underlining the company’s commitment to reduce its carbon emissions.

“When we look at decarbonising our footprint, we are looking at a range of different opportunities,” Mr Pugh said.

“We want to play a part in the energy transition, and so we have quite a few things that we’re looking into, and this (plant) is just one of them.”

Air Liquide Australia managing director Tim Kehoe also spoke at the event, explaining the purification process.

“We take the raw CO2 from the gas plant, run it through our industrial process, and at the end of that process, that CO2 has been purified to the point that it can be used for (the) carbonisation of beverages, for food processing, for medical use, for water treatment – many, many industrial uses,” Mr Kehoe said.

“What would otherwise be a waste product turns into a beneficial product that – and particularly in the context of the Victorian economy – goes to a lot of the local production and manufacturing industries in Victoria.”

Neither Mr Pugh nor Mr Kehoe could provide an exact figure as to how much CO2 would be purified by the Plant, but Mr Kehoe said what the Plant will produce “will cover the entire Victorian market.”

Among the dignitaries in attendance was Federal Member for Gippsland Darren Chester, who expressed his support for the resource industry and its role in the community.

“The growth in the Gippsland region, and Sale in particular, would not have occurred without the joint venture partners (Esso and BHP) in Bass Strait,” Mr Chester said.

“The social, economic and cultural benefits it’s delivered to the Gippsland region has been quite extraordinary

“And as an industry, they’ve seen the need to decarbonise, to get the balance right between the reliable, affordable energy that comes from the production here in Bass Strait and Longford, but also recognising their commitment, and the desire of the whole world, to move to more renewable forms in the longer term.

“So it’s getting the balance right, and I congratulate the companies for the work they’re doing.”

Also in attendance at the ceremony were BHP Petroleum General Manager Australia, Shiva McMahon; Member for Gippsland South Danny O’Brien; and Wellington Shire Councillor John Tatterson.

It is expected that 60 to 80 jobs will be created as part of the construction phase, with the CO2 Processing Plant set to be operational by next year."

Installed over the Oudezijds Achterburgwal canal in Amsterdam in July 2021, the MX3D bridge is also an inspiring demonstration of open innovation with Air Liquide.

Gijs van der Velden, CEO of MX3D, says the idea for the bridge came about at a design agency, while experimenting with a welding robot and smart software that enabled the robot to do more than the usual repetitive movements typically used in industrial processes. Shared on YouTube, the results generated broad interest from the community. ""In 2015, besides one or maybe two universities, nobody had ever tried out this technique—multi-axis 3D printing— of such large size products. We decided it was too good to leave as an experimental idea, so we founded a company."" And why a bridge? ""We needed a flagship project to show what this technique had to offer. If people see a 3D bridge approved by the city and used every day, they understand that the technology has reached a certain maturity and is ready for replication.""

Collaborative innovation creates a first-of-its-kind bridge To make this dream a reality, MX3D worked with a variety of industrial partners, including Air Liquide. As Gijs explains, ""They were a logical partner because we were not metallurgists or specialists in welding, so we were looking for people who could offer this expertise."" Air Liquide conducted testing at its Paris Innovation Campus to find the best type of welding gas composition and flow to use in the fabrication process. Experts from the Group also provided practical support for MX3D’s four-robot factory installation. MX3D wanted to avoid the kind of complex intellectual property issues that can break down collaboration, so throughout the process, an open innovation approach was taken. ""We just said, ‘OK, let’s collaborate on this and see where it can go. Both parties are allowed to learn and we hope both parties get value from it.’ It worked well.""









Naturally, the project was not without challenges. Initially scheduled to debut in 2018, the bridge opening was pushed back several times to overcome unforeseen difficulties. For example, the design had to be modified so that the canal walls could support the weight of the structure, and the software was reprogrammed to avoid premature heating during the soldering process that would weaken the metal. And of course, the Covid-19 pandemic inevitably caused delays. But better late than never, in July 2021, the world’s first 3D-printed stainless steel bridge was inaugurated, a unique 12-meter long architectural and technological feat!

Promising applications For Air Liquide, this R&D collaboration represents an important step forward for its investment in the promising additive manufacturing (industrial 3D printing) market. As Fabien Januard, ALTEC expert in Automotive & Fabrication for Air Liquide, explains, ""The prospects for additive manufacturing are gigantic—similar to the advent of laser technology in the 1980s.” Noting annual growth of 20-30%, he says, ""Additive manufacturing is really at the heart of Industry 4.0. It enables automated production on demand, based on 3D models."" By increasing design freedom that would be too difficult and costly with traditional manufacturing, and by making more efficient use of materials and reducing time to market, the approach simplifies logistics to generate significant gains in terms of costs, time and environmental footprint. As for MX3D, Gijs says the company’s ultimate goal is to ""create the tools other people need so that the next time a bridge is printed, it is done by a bridge expert who knows about the expanded capabilities in product design that this additive manufacturing technology enables for the industry.” Commenting on MX3D’s turnkey 3D printing unit, which is now available to clients, he says, ""That’s where our future lies. We hope the freeform availability we’ve introduced is something others can use as well.""

The MX3D bridge at a glance The world’s first 3D-printed stainless steel bridge and one of the largest 3D-printed objects in existence

Located over the Oudezijds Achterburgwal canal in the center of Amsterdam

12 meters long and 6 meters wide

6 metric tons of stainless steel

Manufactured by four robots

Designed by Joris Laarman Lab

Partners: Air Liquide, ABB, AMS Institute-TU Delft, Arup, ArcelorMittal, Autodesk, Heijmans, Lenovo, Oerlikon and Plymovent

More about additive manufacturing Additive manufacturing is defined as building 3D-modelized objects from the ground up, layer by layer, instead of using machines to join prefabricated parts. Air Liquide provided MX3D with expert advice on arc welding and the suitable welding gases. Argon, nitrogen, helium and other industrial gases play a crucial role along the value chain of all additive manufacturing processes: Gas atomization to produce metal powders

Gas inerting to extrude metal wires

Heat treatment atmospheres

Gas shielding atmospheres for additive manufacturing machines These gases are essential to prevent corrosion and reduce porosity forming and stress cracking quality risks, especially under high heat processes."
