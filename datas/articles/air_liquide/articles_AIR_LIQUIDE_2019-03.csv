According to the Ascension Parish Sheriff’s Office, there was a release of chlorine around 5 a.m.

Investigators have determined the leak occurred at the Westlake facility and the wind carried it to neighboring Air Liquide on Highway 30 near Highway 73 in Geismar. Officials at Westlake are investigating the matter.

A chlorine unit tripped, meaning it stopped operating unexpectedly, according to the Ascension Parish Office of Emergency Preparedness.

“At no time was the public ever in danger during the release,” said Ascension Parish Sheriff Bobby Webre.

As a result of the chlorine release, four Air Liquide workers and a fifth unidentified person were medically evaluated. Two people were transported to a local hospital for further treatment.

Officials say the quantity of chlorine was so small that none of their devices picked up on it. The release was detected by the smell of the chemical.

The OEP says there is no off-site impact and no threat to the community. There are no road closures as a result of the leak.

The chemical was contained and the all clear was given.

The conditions of the five people are unknown at this time.

The investigation of the source of the chlorine release is now being handled by Louisiana State Police.

Cottage Grove to get $54 million Airgas plant - Finance and Commerce,"Tue, 26 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS1jb21tZXJjZS5jb20vMjAxOS8wMy9jb3R0YWdlLWdyb3ZlLXRvLWdldC01NC1taWxsaW9uLWFpcmdhcy1wbGFudC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Listen to this article Listen to this article

Cottage Grove has given the green light to a $54 million factory that will turn air into money.

That’s the business model of Airgas USA, a Philadelphia-based company that sells liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon for use in manufacturing, medicine and other industries. After getting City Council approvals last week, the company is building a new plant near the northeast corner of Jamaica Avenue and 100th Street South, with huge compressors to liquefy and separate air into its component gases.

According to city documents, the plant will consist of two buildings of 17,000 square feet, an outdoor tank farm and a trucking terminal on 8.5 acres. The facility won’t be hard to spot, with two “cold box” towers, 130 and 160 feet tall, rising above the rest of the compressor machinery. The project will create 35 full-time jobs, of which 25 will be truck drivers who will transport the compressed gases directly to customers.

For Cottage Grove, the project is a win-win, Economic Development Specialist Matt Wolf said at a March 20 council meeting. Not only does the project bring new jobs and tax revenue to the city, but it will raise the profile of the city’s available industrial land for other manufacturers.

“A lot of their products are used in that industry, so we really view this as a valuable tool, potentially, for marketing to other business to come to our business park,” Wolf said.

Airgas, which bills itself as “the leading U.S. supplier of industrial, medical and specialty gases,” has six plant and store locations across the Twin Cities with almost 100 workers, Media and PR Manager Kim Menard said in an email. The new plant will allow for more reliable local service for large customers in Minnesota and surrounding states.

“Given our local presence and our growth in the area, we decided to add local bulk capabilities to have a full, reliable supply chain with more locally produced supply,” Menard said.

Cottage Grove isn’t the company’s only expansion in the works. Airgas announced the project in December alongside a second new air separation plant in Fairless Hills, Pennsylvania. The company has additional plants already under construction in North Carolina and Southern California.

According to city documents, the project includes $30 million in land, site work and construction costs and $24 million in machinery and equipment. Airgas initially looked for sites in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa, and identified the Cottage Grove site through Xcel Energy’s Shovel Ready Certification Program.

To land the deal, the state has estimated Airgas is eligible to receive up to $175,000 from the Minnesota Job Creation Fund and $250,000 in forgivable loans through the Minnesota Investment Fund. Cottage Grove has approved its own subsidies, totaling $437,000, and the city Economic Development Authority is buying the land, currently used for farming, to convey it to Airgas for the development.

The plant won’t be up and running until late 2020, but city officials are already rolling out the red carpet. Before the council voted to approve the project, Mayor Myron Bailey said the city is eager to welcome Airgas to town.

“Obviously the city of Cottage Grove supports you and your business,” he said. “We love the fact you’re bringing high-quality, good-paying jobs, and another opportunity in our business park.”

Germany's Merck KGaA launches hostile takeover bid for Versum Materials - The Morning Call,"Tue, 26 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1jYWxsLmNvbS8yMDE5LzAzLzI2L2dlcm1hbnlzLW1lcmNrLWtnYWEtbGF1bmNoZXMtaG9zdGlsZS10YWtlb3Zlci1iaWQtZm9yLXZlcnN1bS1tYXRlcmlhbHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The battle to assume Versum Materials Inc. has grown hostile.

Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, on Tuesday announced it was taking its $5.9 billion, all-cash offer to acquire the company directly to Versum’s shareholders, officially launching a hostile takeover bid for a Tempe, Ariz., company created in 2016 when Air Products spun off its electronics materials division. Versum’s board has so far rejected Merck KGaA’s advances and has continued to reaffirm its commitment to combine with U.S. rival Entegris, a deal announced in late January and billed as a “merger of equals.”

“Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany’s Tender Offer is clearly superior to the Entegris acquisition,” reads part of the letter sent to Versum shareholders. “TELL the Versum Board to start doing its job and put your interests first.”

Versum, which employs hundreds throughout the extended Lehigh Valley region, on Tuesday urged its stockholders to take no action until the company’s board can — once again — review the offer.

Previously, on March 8 — a week after Versum’s board rejected Merck KGaA’s proposal the first time — Versum and Entegris issued an open letter to shareholders, reiterating the benefits of a combined company and announcing an additional $50 million in expected cost synergies if the transaction goes through. In the merger, Versum stockholders would receive 1.12 shares of Entegris for each Versum share. After closing, Entegris stockholders would own 52.5 percent of the combined company, while Versum stockholders would get the remaining 47.5 percent.

“The appropriate comparison is not between Merck’s proposal and the standalone value of Versum, but rather between selling now to Merck based upon their proposal and remaining invested in the combined Entegris-Versum,” said Seifi Ghasemi, chairman of Versum’s board and also chairman, president and CEO of Air Products. “ … We believe Versum’s carefully studied merger with Entegris is the superior strategic and financial combination.”

In its letter to shareholders Tuesday, Merck KGaA called Versum’s recently revised synergy estimates “illusory,” describing the adjustments as a “transparent attempt to catch up to the value of our superior proposal.” Merck KGaA likes the term “superior proposal” so much, it even set up a website on its offer at www.thesuperiorproposal.com.

The fight over Versum, which supplies specialty materials used in the manufacturing of semiconductors and displays, highlights the competitive nature of the field, with the companies seeking to gain an edge in the volatile semiconductor industry driving the digital age. In its annual report, Versum lists Entegris and Merck as competitors, along with Air Liquide, which is expanding in Upper Mount Bethel Township.

For Merck KGaA, acquiring Versum would fit into the expected growth in its performance materials division. According to its annual report, Merck KGaA has launched a transformation program aimed at further expanding its position as a leading electronics industry supplier. After 2019, the company says in its annual report, performance materials is expected to log average annual sales growth of between 2 percent and 3 percent, with “semiconductor solutions as a significant driver of this growth.”

According to Reuters, Merck KGaA’s announcement Tuesday is the first significant hostile takeover attempt of a U.S. firm by a German company since chemical company BASF went after catalytic converter manufacturer Engelhard Corp. in 2006. That situation ended with BASF’s completing its acquisition of Engelhard in June 2006.

Versum employs about 2,200 people worldwide, including about 500 throughout the extended Lehigh Valley region. That includes an office on Vultee Street in south Allentown, along with a $20 million research and development technology center in Rush Township, Schuylkill County."
Shell joins W2C Rotterdam project - News - The Chemical Engineer,"Fri, 15 Mar 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNoZW1pY2FsZW5naW5lZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvc2hlbGwtam9pbnMtdzJjLXJvdHRlcmRhbS1wcm9qZWN0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Curtis Trent / Enerkem

Enerkem already have a successful waste-to-chemicals plant operating in Edmonton, Canada

SHELL has partnered with world-leading companies to build Europe’s first advanced waste-to-chemicals (W2C) facility in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The project represents an important step towards a more sustainable chemical industry and a circular economy.

The W2C project will be the first of its kind in Europe to make valuable chemicals and biofuels from non-recyclable waste materials. The facility, which will use cleantech company Enerkem’s proprietary technology, will be built within the Botlek area of the Port of Rotterdam.

A consortium comprising Air Liquide, Enerkem, Nouryon, and the Port of Rotterdam signed the agreement for the commercial project last year. Shell will now be joining as an equity partner.

The planned facility will convert up to 360,000 t of waste – equivalent to the annual waste of more than 700,000 households – into 220,000 t of biomethanol. Biomethanol is a chemical building block used to manufacture a range of everyday products, and is also a renewable fuel.

For manufacture, non-recyclable mixed waste, including plastics, will be converted into syngas, and then into ‘clean’ methanol for use by the chemical industry and transport sector.

Currently, methanol is generally produced from natural gas or coal. It is estimated that the new facility will save 300,000 t in CO 2 emissions compared to methanol production from fossil fuels. The project is expected to help the Netherlands realise its ambitions of becoming virtually carbon neutral by 2050.

The consortium aims to take the final investment decision (FID) for the project later this year. It has set up a dedicated joint venture, and has already undertaken preparatory work, covering detailed engineering and the permitting process.

Marco Wass, Chairman of the W2C project in Rotterdam and Director RD&I at Nouryon, said: “We are thrilled to have Shell join our group of partners.”

“The EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) coming into effect in 2021, as well as other environmental initiatives such as the Circular Economy Package are creating an ideal environment for leading companies to drive sustainable growth through innovation. The project will be further strengthened with the addition of another leading global partner.”

Andrew Murfin, General Manager of Advanced Biofuels at Shell, said: “Industry partnerships, just like this one, are critical to delivering some of the many solutions society will need to meet energy demand while reducing emissions to tackle climate change and air pollution. Advanced biofuels, including those produced using biomethanol, have the potential to decarbonise the transportation sector, in particular. This is an exciting prospect given transportation accounts for one fifth of global energy-related CO 2 emissions, and will continue to rely on liquid fuels, especially for long journeys and heavy-duty vehicles, for years to come.”

The companies say that W2C is a prime example of how a circular economy can be achieved by reducing fossil fuel reliance, diversifying the energy mix, and by making lower-carbon products whilst also offering a smart, sustainable alternative to landfilling and incineration.

The W2C project is supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy, which has agreed to develop mechanisms and regulation to bring the technology to full scale, to support the low-carbon transition of the Dutch economy.

W2C is also supported by the City of Rotterdam, the Province of Zuid-Holland and regional development agency InnovationQuarter."

“This represents the total annual waste of more than 700,000 households,” as well as carbon dioxide emissions reductions “estimated at about 300,000 tonnes when compared to the production of methanol from fossil fuels.”

“Industry partnerships just like this one are critical to delivering some of the many solutions society will need to meet energy demand while reducing emissions to tackle climate change and air pollution,” said Shell General Manager, Advanced Biofuels Andrew Murfin. “Advanced biofuels, including those produced using bio-methanol, have the potential to decarbonize the transportation sector, in particular,” where Shell believes users “will continue to rely on liquid fuels, especially for long journeys and heavy duty vehicles, for years to come.”

With two production lines, the Rotterdam plant will have twice the capacity of Enerkem’s commercial operation in Edmonton. “It will benefit from the state-of-the-art infrastructure available within the Port of Rotterdam, as well as synergies with Air Liquide (large industries) for supplying the required oxygen and with Nouryon, for the hydrogen raw material,” the release states. “The current aim is that the facility’s sustainable methanol output will be purchased by Nouryon and Shell.”

Enerkem casts the waste-to-chemicals project as “a prime example of how a true circular economy can be achieved by preventing the use of fossil sources for new materials, diversifying the energy mix, and by making everyday products lower carbon while offering a smart, sustainable alternative to landfilling and incineration. The project can help The Netherlands realize its ambition to become virtually carbon-neutral by 2050.”"
