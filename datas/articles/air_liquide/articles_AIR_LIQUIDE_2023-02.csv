Paris, February 2, 2023 - TotalEnergies and Air Liquide announce their decision to create an equally owned joint venture to develop a network of hydrogen stations, geared towards heavy duty vehicles on major European road corridors. This initiative will help facilitate access to hydrogen, enabling the development of its use for goods transportation and further strengthening the hydrogen sector.

The partners aim to deploy more than 100 hydrogen stations on major European roads - in France, Benelux and Germany - in the coming years. These stations, under the TotalEnergies brand, will be located on major strategic corridors.

This agreement will lead to the creation of a major player in hydrogen refueling solutions and contribute to the decarbonization of road transportation in Europe. The two companies will combine their know-how and expertise in infrastructure, hydrogen distribution and mobility:

TotalEnergies will bring its expertise in the operation and management of stations networks and the distribution of energies to BtoB customers;

Air Liquide will contribute with its expertise in technologies and its mastery of the entire hydrogen value chain.

The joint venture, which will be jointly managed by TotalEnergies and Air Liquide, will invest, build and operate these stations, as well as procure hydrogen from the market and dispense it to its transport customers.

""Following the recent signature of a partnership for the production of renewable and low-carbon hydrogen on our Grandpuits Zero Crude Platform, we are pleased to once again join forces with Air Liquide and continue our common efforts to decarbonize mobility. As pioneers in hydrogen mobility, we are convinced of the necessity to start building now a heavy-duty network that will benefit our customers” says Thierry Pflimlin, President Marketing & Services, TotalEnergies. ""This new partnership with Air Liquide will enable us to continue our development across the entire hydrogen value chain.""

Matthieu Giard, Vice President and Executive Committee Member of the Air Liquide Group, supervising the Hydrogen activities, underlines: ""Hydrogen offers clear benefits for heavy duty mobility. To promote its widespread use, it is imperative to accelerate the development of refueling infrastructures and to offer vehicle manufacturers and transport operators a sufficiently dense network of stations. It is precisely the ambition of this joint venture, which will benefit from the complementary expertise of Air Liquide and TotalEnergies. As a leader for over 60 years and with unique know-how and technologies, Air Liquide is a major player to accelerate and scale up the development of hydrogen, a key element for the emergence of a low-carbon society.""

The two partners plan to establish their joint venture in 2023, subject to the finalization of the appropriate contractual documentation and to the receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals.

2022: Strong performance and acceleration of investment decisions to prepare the future - Air Liquide,"Thu, 16 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5haXJsaXF1aWRlLmNvbS9ncm91cC9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy1uZXdzLzIwMjMtMDItMTYvMjAyMi1zdHJvbmctcGVyZm9ybWFuY2UtYW5kLWFjY2VsZXJhdGlvbi1pbnZlc3RtZW50LWRlY2lzaW9ucy1wcmVwYXJlLWZ1dHVyZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Commenting on 2022 sales, François Jackow, Chief Executive Oﬃcer of the Air Liquide Group, stated:

“In 2022, the Group delivered a strong performance despite a complex and changing geopolitical, economic and sanitary context. The quality of these published results illustrates the proven resilience of the Group’s business model, characterized by a very broad diversity of geographies and markets, as well as the remarkable mobilization and responsiveness of our teams to adapt to this volatile environment. For the Group, 2022 was also marked by the launch of ADVANCE, its strategic plan for 2025, which closely combines financial and extra-financial performance. This is already reflected in an acceleration of our investment momentum, which will feed our future growth, particularly in low-carbon hydrogen and the transition to a low-carbon society. On the extra-financial level, the Group’s CO2[1] emissions remained stable for the second consecutive year. This supports our objective of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. Air Liquide has delivered another year of profitable growth: Sales reached 29.9 billion euros, up +7% on a comparable basis, the operating margin increased by +70 basis points excluding the energy impact, and recurring net profit[2] rose +17% at constant exchange rates. At 10.3%, recurring ROCE[3] is higher than 10%, one year ahead of the target communicated as part of ADVANCE. All activities are growing significantly: the Gas & Services business, which represents 95% of the Group’s revenue, is up +6.1%, on a comparable basis, the Engineering & Construction business by +20.6% and Global Markets & Technologies by +25.8%. Within Gas & Services, all our geographies posted growth, in particular the Americas and Asia Pacific. By business line, the increase in sales was notably driven by Industrial Merchant and Electronics. The Group further improved its operating margin by +70 basis points excluding the energy impact. It generated significant efficiencies amounting to 378 million euros and continued its dynamic management of its business portfolio. In a context of a sharp and lasting rise in energy prices, it demonstrated the strength of its business model, in which Large Industries contracts are indexed to energy prices, and where its ability to create value allows it to adjust prices for its Industrial Merchant customers. The investment decisions reached a record level of nearly 4 billion euros. 12-month investment opportunities remain plentiful and total 3.3 billion euros, out of which more than 40% are linked to the energy transition. Cash ﬂow on sales excluding the energy impact improved by +110 basis points, allowing the Group to finance its investments and pay a dividend, while at the same time reducing its debt. Reflecting our confidence in the future, and following the allocation in 2022 of one free share for every 10 held, the dividend that will be submitted to the shareholders’ vote in May amounts to 2.95 euros per share, i.e. an increase of +12.2%. In 2023, Air Liquide will continue to roll out its ADVANCE strategic plan. The year is expected to be marked by the signing of several major projects in the field of decarbonization and energy transition in Europe and by an acceleration of these opportunities in the United States. Air Liquide is conﬁdent in its ability to further increase its operating margin and to deliver recurring net proﬁt growth, at constant exchange rates.[4]”

Financial performance

Group revenue for 2022 totaled 29,934 million euros, a strong comparable growth of +7.0% over 2021. The Group’s revenue as published posted a signiﬁcant increase of +28.3% in 2022, with a record high energy impact of +15.3% as well as a favorable currency impact of +5.8%, while the signiﬁcant scope impact was limited (+0.2%).

This performance was delivered in a challenging context of exceptionally high energy prices, strong inﬂation, strain on supply chains and the conflict in Ukraine. The Group beneﬁted from a solid business model and diversity of business reach in terms of geographies, businesses, end-markets and customers which ensured a resilient performance and allowed the Group to take advantage of all growth opportunities. The ADVANCE strategic plan reinforces these attributes which position the Group in growth markets of the future (in particular the energy transition, Semiconductors and Healthcare).

Gas & Services revenue in 2022 totaled 28,573 million euros, a strong comparable increase of +6.1%. The growth stood at +28.3% as published: the energy impact (+16.1%) reached a record level over the year, with a peak in the 3rd quarter, the currency impact (+5.8%) also made a positive contribution, while the significant scope effect (+0.3%) remained limited. The latter corresponds to the additional contribution in 2022 of the 16 Sasol units acquired in June 2021, less the effect of the deconsolidation of the activities in Russia from September 1, 2022.

Gas & Services revenue in the Americas totaled 10,680 million euros in 2022, up sharply by +10.2% on a comparable basis. The Large Industries business (+3.7%) benefited from the start-up of several production units and solid demand. In the Industrial Merchant business, sales increased by +13.5%, supported by the strong increase in prices. Despite a high basis of comparison due to the covid-19 pandemic in 2021, Healthcare revenue was up +3.9% thanks to the development of the proximity care business in the United States and the Home Healthcare business in Latin America. Finally, Electronics posted sales up +5.8% over the year, driven by strong growth in Carrier Gases and Specialty Materials.

Revenue in Europe was up +2.0% on a comparable basis in 2022 and totaled 11,390 million euros . Sales evolution was contrasted depending on business lines. In a context of very high energy prices, Large Industries sales were down by -16.6% over the year, strongly impacted by volumes down -8% and a combined effect [5] in the 3 rd quarter. The Industrial Merchant business line saw an exceptionally high level of sales growth of +24.1%, benefitting from a record price effect of +23.6%. Healthcare revenue posted an increase of +4.4%, supported by the dynamism of Home Healthcare and despite a high basis of comparison due to the covid-19 pandemic in 2021.

Revenue for the Asia-Pacific region in 2022 rose sharply by +7.0% on a comparable basis, to total 5,608 million euros . It beneﬁted from particularly dynamic growth in the Electronics business (+17.8%). Sales in Large Industries were stable (+0.3%), with the covid-19 pandemic disrupting business growth in China, while sales in the rest of Asia remained low throughout the year. In Industrial Merchant, sales benefited from a sharp rise in prices and increased by +4.2%.

Revenue for 2022 in the Middle East and Africa was up +0.8% to 895 million euros. Volumes in Large Industries increased sharply in South Africa with the integration of the 16 Sasol Air Separation Units, whose acquisition was ﬁnalized at the end of the 1st half of 2021; thus sales of 126 million euros over the year were accounted for in the signiﬁcant scope impact and hence excluded from comparable growth. In Industrial Merchant, sales were down over the year, with the +6.4% increase in prices not fully offsetting the divestiture of small businesses in the Middle East.

The two growth drivers for 2022 were the Industrial Merchant business, with sales up +14.2%, supported by a record price effect of +14.7% and resilient volumes, and the Electronics business, with revenue up +16.4%. Despite a high basis of comparison in 2021 related to covid-19, sales in Healthcare increased by +3.6%, supported by the strong development of Home Healthcare, particularly in Europe, and proximity care in the United States. Sales in Large Industries were down -6.6%, marked by mixed activity depending on the geography: in Europe, the decline in volumes was part of a context of an exceptionally strong increase in energy prices, while sales increased in America and remained stable in Asia.

Consolidated revenue from Engineering & Construction totaled 474 million euros in 2022, up strongly by +20.6%. Order intake for Group projects and third-party customers exceeded 1 billion euros for the second consecutive year.

Global Markets & Technologies revenue for 2022 reached 887 million euros, representing a very high growth of +25.8% compared to 2021. Biogas maintained strong momentum and sales of Turbo-Brayton LNG reliquefaction units contributed to the growth. Order intake for Group projects and third-party customers totaled 875 million euros, representing a dynamic increase of +25% compared to 2021.

Efficiencies[6] amounted to 378 million euros over the year. They represent a saving of 2.2% of the cost base. In a context of high inﬂation unfavorable to procurement eﬃciencies, the priority for the teams is to limit cost increases and transfer them to sales prices.

The Group's operating income recurring (OIR) reached 4,862 million euros. It was up sharply by +16.9% as published and +10.5% on a comparable basis, which is significantly higher than comparable sales growth of +7.0%. The operating margin (OIR to revenue ratio) stood at 16.2% as published, representing a -160 basis point decline compared with 2021, due to the sharp increase in energy costs which are contractually passed through to Large Industries customers. This therefore has a mechanical dilutive impact on the published margin. Excluding the energy impact, the operating margin improved very signiﬁcantly by +70 basis points. This performance integrates the dilutive impact of strong inﬂation on costs other than energy costs, in Industrial Merchant in particular, and which is transferred to sales prices. This +70 basis point improvement therefore particularly reﬂected the Group’s ability to rapidly transfer to sales prices the exceptionally strong and brutal increase in energy costs and inﬂation in general.

Net proﬁt (Group share) stood at 2,759 million euros in 2022, showing strong growth of +7.3% as published and an increase of +1.0% excluding the currency impact. The recurring net income[7] (Group share) stood at 3,162 million euros, up sharply by +22.9%, and +17.3% excluding the currency impact, compared to 2021 recurring net income (Group share). Recurring net income (Group share) thus exceeded 3 billion euros for the first time.

Net earnings per share, at 5.28 euros, were up +7.0%[8] compared with 2021, in line with the increase in net profit (Group share).

Cash flows from operating activities before changes in working capital amounted to 6,255 million euros, a marked increase of +18.2% and of +12.0% excluding the currency impact. The cash flow over sales ratio reached a high level of 20.9%, a significant improvement of +110 basis points compared with 2021, excluding the energy impact.

Net debt at December 31, 2022, amounted to 10,261 million euros, a decrease of 187 million euros compared with December 31, 2021. The increase in the Group’s cash ﬂows from operating activities before changes in working capital makes it possible to reduce net debt after the payment of more than 3.2 billion euros in investments and nearly 1.5 billion euros in dividends.

In 2022, industrial and financial investment decisions reached a record level of nearly 4.0 billion euros. The 12-month portfolio of investment opportunities remained high at 3.3 billion euros at the end of 2022 and the projects related to energy transition represented more than 40% of the investment opportunities. The portfolio of opportunities beyond 12 months also includes the first significant projects related to the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States, particularly along the Gulf Coast.

The additional contribution to sales of unit start-ups and ramp-ups totaled 421 million euros in 2022, including a 128 million euro contribution by the Sasol units in South Africa, with 126 million euros being accounted for in the signiﬁcant scope.

The return on capital employed after tax (ROCE) was 9.1% in 2022. The recurring ROCE[9] stood at 10.3%, a significant improvement compared to 9.3% in 2021 and reached the ADVANCE strategic plan's ROCE target (of over 10%) one year early.

At the Annual General Meeting on May 3, 2023, the payment of a dividend of 2.95 euros per share will be proposed to shareholders for the fiscal year 2022. Following the free share attribution of 1 for 10 in June 2022, the proposed dividend shows a strong growth of +12.2% compared with the previous year. The ex-dividend date is scheduled for May 15, 2023 and the payment is scheduled for May 17, 2023.

Extra-financial performance

The ADVANCE strategic plan combines financial and extra-financial performance. The Group's scopes 1 and 2 CO2 emissions totaled 39 million metric tonnes of CO2-equivalent in 2022. Thus, CO2 emissions[10] remained stable for the 2nd consecutive year, in line with the objective of reaching an inflection point in 2025 before initiating a downward trend towards carbon neutrality in 2050. The Group's commitment to sustainable development goes beyond climate objectives: thus in 2022, the number of lost-time accidents among Air Liquide employees decreased by -11%, 42% of the Group's 67,100 employees (+8 pts) benefitted from a common basis of care coverage and 1.8 million people have access to medical oxygen in low- and moderate-income countries thanks to the Access Oxygen program.

Air Liquide’s Board of Directors, which met on February 15, 2023, approved the audited financial statements for the 2022 fiscal year. The Statutory Auditors are in the process of issuing a report with an unqualified opinion.

Governance

On the recommendation of the Appointments and Governance Committee, the Board of Directors also approved the draft resolutions which will be submitted to the General Meeting of May 3, 2023 in order to appoint for a period of four years as Directors:



Ms Catherine Guillouard , former Chairwoman and Chief Executive Officer of RATP (until September 2022) and previously Chief Financial Officer of Rexel, Eutelsat and Air France. She will bring to the Board her extensive financial skills as well as her experience as an executive in a major public transport group, where she led the transformation and decarbonization plan.

Ms Christina Law , a Chinese national (Hong Kong) and based in Singapore. She will bring to the Board her in-depth knowledge of Asian markets, and her managerial experience in large international groups specializing in the fields of healthcare and treatment.

Mr Alexis Perakis-Valat , President of the Consumer Products Division of the L'Oréal group, the group’s main division. He will bring to the Board his knowledge of consumer product markets and his managerial experience within a leading international group, where he has been one of the driving forces behind major transformations carried out in recent years.

Mr Michael H. Thaman, an American national. He has extensive knowledge of North American industrial markets as well as a strong international profile. He will bring nearly 30 years of experience, including 13 years as Chief Executive Officer and then Executive Chairman, at Owens Corning, a world leader in construction materials and one of the highest-rated American groups on environmental and societal criteria, and his experience as a Director in other major global listed US groups, particularly in the field of renewable energies.

The Board stated that it considered Ms Catherine Guillouard, Ms Christina Law as well as Mr Alexis Perakis-Valat and Mr Michael H. Thaman to be independent.

In addition, the Board of Directors took note of the resignation, with effect on January 3, 2023, of Ms Anette Bronder, due to her decision to take an executive position with an audit firm, which is incompatible with the maintenance of her office as a Director of L'Air Liquide S.A. On the recommendation of the Appointments and Governance Committee, the Board of February 15, 2023, decided to co-opt for the remaining term of office of Ms Anette Bronder, i.e. until the close of the 2024 General Meeting, Ms Monica de Virgiliis as a Director of the Company. Of dual Italian and French nationality and former Director of Strategy at the CEA in Paris after a career of more than 15 years in the field of electronics (at ST Microelectronics and Infineon), she will bring to the Board strong experience in the field of technology and energy. Very committed to energy transition, she is the founder and President of Chapter Zero France, a non-profit association aiming to raise awareness of climate issues to Directors. The ratification of such cooptation will be submitted to the General Meeting of May 3, 2023. The Board stated that it considered Ms Monica de Virgiliis to be independent.

Concerning Ms Siân Herbert Jones, whose term of office as Director will expire at the close of the General Meeting of May 2023, the Board took note of her wish not to seek renewal of her office. The Board warmly thanked her for her contribution, during her 12 years in office, to the work of the Board of Directors and for her very active involvement in the Audit and Accounts Committee, of which she was a member since 2013 and chaired since May 2015.

Concerning Ms Geneviève Berger whose term of office as Director will expire at the close of the General Meeting of May 2023, also indicated that she does not wish to seek renewal of her office as Director. The Board took due note and warmly thanked her for her contribution to the work of the Board of Directors since 2015, as well as her participation in the Environment and Society Committee, of which she was a member since its creation in 2017.

At the end of the General Meeting to be held on May 3, 2023, the Board of Directors would therefore comprise 14 members: 12 members appointed by the General Meeting, most of whom are independent (i.e. 83% independent Directors), including 5 women (i.e. 42%), 5 foreign nationals and 2 Directors representing the employees.

Finally, the Board of Directors will submit to the vote of the General Meeting the elements of remuneration of Mr Benoît Potier, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (from January 1 to May 31, 2022), Mr François Jackow, Chief Executive Officer (from June 1 to December 31, 2022), Mr Benoît Potier, Chairman of the Board of Directors (from June 1 to December 31, 2022), together with the information relating to the remuneration of all the corporate officers for 2022. The General Meeting will also be invited to decide upon the remuneration policy for the corporate officers which will apply to Mr. François Jackow, Chief Executive Officer, to Mr Benoît Potier, Chairman of the Board of Directors and to the Directors.

Under the new partnership, TotalEnergies and Air Liquide aim to deploy more than 100 hydrogen stations on major road corridors in France, Benelux and Germany, creating a major player in hydrogen refueling solutions, and contributing to the decarbonization of road transport.

The initiative, jointly managed by TotalEnergies and Air Liquide, will invest, build and operate the stations as well as procure hydrogen from the market and dispense it to its transport customers.

Thierry Pflimlin, President Marketing & Services, TotalEnergies, said:

“As pioneers in hydrogen mobility, we are convinced of the necessity to start building now a heavy-duty network that will benefit our customers. This new partnership with Air Liquide will enable us to continue our development across the entire hydrogen value chain.”

The partnership will combine TotalEnergies’ expertise in the operation and management of station networks as well as the distribution of energies to BtoB customers, with Air Liquide’s technologies and hydrogen value chain capabilities. Last year, as part of it’s “ADVANCE” strategic plan, Air Liquide unveiled plans to invest €8 billion in hydrogen supply chain by 2035, and to triple hydrogen revenues in order to reach more than €6 billion by that time.

Matthieu Giard, Vice President and Executive Committee Member of the Air Liquide Group, supervising the Hydrogen activities, said:"

“This agreement will lead to the creation of a major player in hydrogen refueling solutions and contribute to the decarbonisation of road transportation in Europe,” they said in a statement.

The companies did not say when the “more than 100” filling stations would be installed.

But the corporations declared that Air Liquide will bring “its mastery of the entire hydrogen value chain” to the as-yet-unnamed venture, while Total will add its expertise in operations and managing fuelling station networks.

The new entity, which will be jointly managed by both companies, “will invest, build and operate these stations, as well as procure hydrogen from the market and dispense it to its transport customers”.

“Hydrogen offers clear benefits for heavy duty mobility. To promote its widespread use, it is imperative to accelerate the development of refueling infrastructures and to offer vehicle manufacturers and transport operators a sufficiently dense network of stations,” said Matthieu Giard, Air Liquide Group vice-president in charge of hydrogen activities. “[That] is precisely the ambition of this joint venture.”

It is notable that the statement does not mention hydrogen cars — and that Shell recently closed all its hydrogen filling stations in the UK, partly because they could not cater to larger vehicles.

While hydrogen-powered cars are more expensive to buy, operate and maintain than their battery-electric equivalents, H 2 trucks are said to be more practical than battery equivalents due to their fast-charging times.

For road freight operators, time spent recharging electric trucks would effectively be money wasted, as individual trucks are often on the go around the clock, with different drivers at the wheel.

There are also questions surrounding the ability of electricity grids to cope with surges of power demand at truck stops if several heavy-duty electric vehicles wanted to fast-charge their large batteries at the same time.

According to German consultancy Ludwig-Bölkow-Systemtechnik, which has been maintaining a website showing the locations of all hydrogen filling stations around the world since 2005, there were 105 H 2 fuelling pumps operating in Germany at the end of 2022, with 44 in France, 17 in the Netherlands, six in Belgium and none in Luxembourg.

The consultancy says that there were 914 hydrogen refuelling stations in operation worldwide at the end of last year, with 254 in Europe, 455 in Asia — 165 in Japan, 149 in South Korea and an estimated 138 in China — and 89 in the US, 70 of which are in California."
TotalEnergies & Air Liquide join forces on H2 refuelling for trucks | electrive.com - www.electrive.com,"Thu, 02 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsZWN0cml2ZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wMi8wMi90b3RhbGVuZXJnaWVzLWFpci1saXF1aWRlLWpvaW4tZm9yY2VzLW9uLWgyLXJlZnVlbGxpbmctZm9yLXRydWNrcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In Europe, the energy group TotalEnergies and the hydrogen gas manufacturer Air Liquide have decided to set up a joint venture to build hydrogen refuelling stations for heavy-duty vehicles in France, Benelux and Germany. The corresponding joint venture is to be established before the end of 2023.

The partners plan to build more than 100 hydrogen refuelling stations along major European road corridors in France, Benelux and Germany, but have not yet specified how or where these will be placed. The corresponding joint venture is subject to the finalisation of the relevant contracts and receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals.

The two companies’ roles are very clear: TotalEnergies will bring its “expertise in the operation and management of stations networks and the distribution of energies to B2B customers”; while Air Liquide will contribute with its expertise in technologies and its “mastery of the entire hydrogen value chain.”

Air Liquide is indeed one of the biggest players in this space. With cooperation agreements all over the globe from Europe to, North America and Australia, in mid-2020, the company already committed to creating a hydrogen corridor across Europe for 1000 trucks in collaboration with the Port of Rotterdam. The target is to have 1,000 fuel cell trucks using this corridor by 2025.

The joint venture with Air Liquide follows TotalEnergie’s cooperation agreement with Daimler Truck in autumn 2021 for H2 mobility in long-haul transport. H2 Mobility is a German government-funded hydrogen filling station operator that received an investment of 110 million euros to enable its next phase of growth. The primary investor is the French finance company Hy24. The expansion goals are focused on hydrogen-powered commercial vehicles of all sizes.

The collaboration with Daimler was to provide up to 150 H2 filling stations that would be built under the direction of Total in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, France and Germany.

This is where the loop between the three companies closes: At the end of 2020, Linde and Daimler Truck signed an agreement to jointly develop the next generation of liquid hydrogen refuelling technology for fuel cell trucks. Until now, TotalEnergies had signed a memorandum of understanding with Hyzon Motors to evaluate and develop hydrogen refuelling and vehicle supply solutions for long-haul transport to customers across Europe. TotalEnergie, traditionally an oil firm, now appears to be not only fully committed to electric charging infrastructure but also hydrogen refuelling for trucks.

Thierry Pflimlin, President of Marketing & Services, TotalEnergies extrapolated on its hydrogen plans: “Following the recent signature of a partnership for the production of renewable and low-carbon hydrogen on our Grandpuits Zero Crude Platform, we are pleased to once again join forces with Air Liquide and continue our common efforts to decarbonise mobility.”

Matthieu Giard, Vice President and Executive Committee Member of the Air Liquide Group, supervising the Hydrogen activities, underlined: “Hydrogen offers clear benefits for heavy-duty mobility. To promote its widespread use, it is imperative to accelerate the development of refuelling infrastructures and to offer vehicle manufacturers and transport operators a sufficiently dense network of stations.” He summarised, It is precisely the ambition of this joint venture, which will benefit from the complementary expertise of Air Liquide and TotalEnergies.”

The Hydrogen Stream: Honda reveals plans to halve fuel cell costs by 2030 - pv magazine International,"Fri, 03 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB2LW1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS8yMDIzLzAyLzAzL3RoZS1oeWRyb2dlbi1zdHJlYW0taG9uZGEtd2FudHMtdG8taGFsdmUtZnVlbC1jZWxsLXN5c3RlbS1jb3N0LWJ5LTIwMzAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Honda has revealed plans to launch an all-new fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) based on the CR-V 5-seater SUV next year. The Japanese company said it will also sell its fuel cell systems in the open market to promote its hydrogen fuel cell systems, in cooperation with General Motors. This will allow it to reach economies of scale. Honda said fuel cell stack costs should become comparable with diesel engines by 2030, at about one-third to half of current costs. “We have identified four core domains we will focus on during the early phase of our hydrogen business: Honda FCEV models, commercial vehicles, stationary power stations and construction machinery,” said Arata Ichinose, head of business development at Honda. The company will also collaborate with original equipment manufacturers on commercial vehicles and construction machinery in Japan and China.

Morocco “is well positioned” to become a regional leader in the green hydrogen economy, ranking alongside the United States, Saudi Arabia, Australia, and Chile as the five countries most likely to produce cost-competitive green hydrogen, wrote the Atlantic Council. North Africa has the potential to become the world's foremost producer of green hydrogen, should Europe channel significant investments. “Algeria has the largest wind energy potential on the continent – approximately 7,700 GW if fully developed – and released plans to expand renewable energy production to 15 GW by 2035, with an annual growth rate of 1 GW. Mauritania's combined solar and wind potential exceeds 500 GW if fully developed,” said the US think tank.

Air Liquide and TotalEnergies has decided to set up an equally owned joint venture to develop a network of hydrogen stations for heavy-duty vehicles on major European road corridors. “The partners aim to deploy more than 100 hydrogen stations on major European roads – in France, Benelux, and Germany – in the coming years,” said Air Liquide. The French groups said they will invest in the stations and produce hydrogen from the market.

Alstom has announced a passenger service demonstration project for its Coradia iLint hydrogen-powered train in Canada, in partnership with the provincial government of Quebec, Chemin de fer Charlevoix, Train de Charlevoix, Harnois Énergies, and HTEC. “The province of Quebec will be the first jurisdiction in the Americas to run a train with zero direct emissions powered by green hydrogen,” said the French company.

The French government has announced €126 million ($136.7 million) of aid for 14 territorial hydrogen ecosystems, within the call launched in 2020. A new call for projects will take place in 2023. “The objective is to continue the deployment of hydrogen ecosystems, particularly for industrial uses,” said the French government. The new call for projects will be launched after a consultation in February.

Plug Power and Johnson Matthey have announced a long-term strategic partnership to accelerate the green hydrogen economy. Johnson Matthey will become a strategic supplier of membrane electrode assemblies (MEA) components, providing a portion of Plug Power's demand for catalysts, membranes, and catalyst-coated membranes (CCM). “Plug and Johnson Matthey will co-invest in what is expected to be the largest (5 GW scaling to 10 GW over time) CCM manufacturing facility in the world,” said Plug Power. “The facility will be built in the United States and likely begin production in 2025.”"

The scope of this report covers the global market for biogas upgrading equipment and as well as analysis its various segments. Market figures are based on the revenues derived from equipment sales and are projected in constant 2021 dollars (i.e., inflation is not computed into the projection figures). The revenue figures are derived from estimated revenues of the key players in a particular year.

Biogas is generated through a microbial fermentation process known as anaerobic digestion (AD), by which various waste streams can be cost-effectively converted into sources of electricity and thermal energy. At the heart of the technology is the anaerobic digester, which in combination with a turbine or gas engine, can serve as a complete power plant. Solid waste landfills also generate a recoverable biological gas through natural AD. Large quantities of gaseous fuel methane can be produced by the process; a valuable by-product in the form of fertilizer is also generated.



While considerable buzz and media attention has focused on a future ""hydrogen economy"" anticipated to replace the present one based on fossil fuel energy, a genuine biogas economy has been quietly emerging in Europe and Asia. Increasingly, the process is making inroads into the U.S. and other countries as a sustainable energy alternative.



Biogas is defined as a multilateral source of renewable energy that has the ability to replace conventional fuels in the generation of power and heat. It can also be utilized as a gaseous fuel for vehicles. Upgraded biogas or biomethane is an ideal alternative to natural gas.



Owing to soaring global demand for carbon neutrality and renewable energy, a significant rise in demand for biomethane has been observed. Biomethane is also referred to as renewable natural gas or RNG. Favorable policies focused on divesting from imported natural gas, alternative fuel standards, diversion of food waste from landfills, as well as tax credits have played a key role in bolstering demand for biomethane.



Legislation and the desire to cut greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) are the most important drivers for biogas plant construction. Kyoto Protocol requirements and specifications of the EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED) are two examples of this type of legislation. Energy security, the desire to draw on domestic fuel resources, and elimination of the expense and price volatility of imported fossil fuel also encourage interest in biogas. Worldwide, most countries have targets for renewable energy production, GHG mitigation or laws related to minimizing harmful landfill emissions.



Large-scale AD waste treatment can help reduce GHGs in a number of ways: by directly replacing fossil fuels, minimizing energy use at waste treatment plants, lowering methane emissions from landfill sites, lessening transportation costs related to waste hauling, reducing electrical grid losses and replacing chemical fertilizers with organic products. Unlike liquid biofuels, biogas, for the most part, eliminates the food vs. fuel debate by using waste materials instead of energy crops.



With varying levels of clean-up, also called upgrading, biogas can be used in the same end uses as natural gas, namely, heat and power production, insertion into the pipeline and as vehicle fuel. With improved technologies and market support, biogas might also find application in ships or planes.

A technology overview, a discussion on the structure of the industry and brief profiles for major participating companies are included. The machinery used to transform the gas to electricity (reciprocating and other types of gas engines, turbine and microturbines, and fuel cells) is not included in the analysis.

Meet the Members: Air Liquide - Hydrogen Council,"Mon, 06 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vaHlkcm9nZW5jb3VuY2lsLmNvbS9lbi9tZWV0LXRoZS1tZW1iZXJzLWFpci1saXF1aWRlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In 2017, Air Liquide founded the Hydrogen Council in collaboration with Toyota. Why was it important to create this world first, CEO-led initiative?

Hydrogen is a major solution to fight climate change and to decarbonize among the most emitting sectors, namely industry and mobility. Air Liquide and Toyota have always believed in the potential of this molecule to tackle this challenge, at a time when few did.

At the beginning, it was primarily a matter of putting hydrogen on the agenda of politicians and investors. This led to the creation in January 2017 of the Hydrogen Council, with 11 other industrial players. Very quickly, the topic became strategic for many stakeholders. One of the reasons for its success is probably because the Hydrogen Council has brought together complementary expertise from different sectors all over the world.

In what way would you say the Hydrogen Council has evolved?

The Hydrogen Council has become a force to be reckoned with. With close to 150 members today, the Hydrogen Council’s ever-diversifying membership reflects the breadth of sectors and geographies in which hydrogen can play an essential role. Data analysis, scientific know-how, technological expertise, regulatory knowledge… All these competencies provide rich in-depth studies and a quite unique comprehensive vision of what it takes to build a whole sector and its ecosystem.

For the past years, the Hydrogen Council has played an active role not only in raising awareness among public authorities around the world but also in highlighting the way policies and regulations could impact the development of infrastructures and hydrogen usages. Today, around 40 countries have now announced a hydrogen strategy. $240 billion worth of investment* have been announced by companies and countries. This figure could be tripled by 2030.

Can you tell us about Air Liquide’s ambitions toward hydrogen?

As a pioneer and a leader in hydrogen development, Air Liquide has committed to invest €8 billion worldwide in the low-carbon hydrogen value chain by 2035. The Group has also planned 3 GW of electrolysis capacity to be deployed by 2030.

Many projects across the world are underway to drastically increase the Group’s production capacities in renewable and low-carbon hydrogen. In 2023, an electrolyser with a 30 MW capacity will be commissioned in Germany. We will scale-up even more in 2025 with the Air Liquide Normand’Hy’s project in France: a 200 MW electrolyzer that will feed with renewable hydrogen our industrial customers in the region but also serve heavy-duty mobility.

At the same time, Air Liquide is multiplying its partnerships with major companies across the world to build a global hydrogen economy: energy players, equipment manufacturers, infrastructure operators… It’s only by working together that we can achieve the necessary transition and build a hydrogen economy.

As momentum for hydrogen continues to grow, what are the areas of focus for the Hydrogen Council in 2023?

2022 gave an unprecedented stimulus to low-carbon and renewable hydrogen. Now is the time to scale up. Investment, policy and infrastructure – these are three major challenges on the way to building the hydrogen economy today. These areas are precisely where the Hydrogen Council can make a difference.

What differentiates the Hydrogen Council is the personal implication of its members, at the highest level of their organizations. What collectively drives us is not only a common conviction of the key role of hydrogen in the energy transition, but more importantly the fact that we need all the bricks of the ecosystem to align for hydrogen to become a reality. More than ever, we need to accelerate if we want to make the 2020s the hydrogen decade. It is up to us to transform this vision into a global reality.

MNCs share optimistic outlook on China market - Chinadaily.com.cn - China Daily,"Wed, 15 Feb 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmFsLmNoaW5hZGFpbHkuY29tLmNuL2EvMjAyMzAyLzE1L1dTNjNlYzM3ZjJhMzEwNTdjNDdlYmFlZTE0Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"China Daily | Updated: 2023-02-15 09:39

(First row left to right) Nicolas Poirot, president and CEO of Air Liquide China; Xia Fuliang, president of Evonik Greater China; (second row left to right) Xie Xue, president of Vale China; Rajat Agarwal, president of Henkel Greater China; Julian MacCormac, regional director of Rolls-Royce Greater China.

Editor's Note: China Daily is publishing interviews with CEOs of major foreign enterprises to gauge their outlook for the Chinese economy, their operations in China and their business plans for 2023.

Q1 Given the backdrop of a feared global economic recession, threats to global supply chains and the deep impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, what's your outlook for China's economy and your company's operations in China in 2023?

POIROT: Many economists have expressed optimism for China's economic outlook, predicting that there will be a rebound from the second quarter or second half of this year. Air Liquide has maintained solid growth in China amid multiple global challenges — such as an economic slowdown, supply chain disruptions, energy and climate crises — while guaranteeing stable supplies of essential products to customers in all sectors. In 2022, we put several new production facilities into operation in Tianjin, Shanghai, Chongqing and the provinces of Zhejiang, Sichuan, Jiangsu and Shandong to increase future supply. With the revival of the market, we remain confident in our operations in China for 2023.

XIA: With the updated COVID-19 policies, China is quickly rebounding from the pandemic. It is expected that China's economy will achieve an overall recovery and improvement in 2023. The boost from China's reopening will also inject impetus into the global economy and bring confidence to the business community worldwide. China is the world's largest producer and consumer of specialty chemicals. Evonik wants to grow with the Chinese market; therefore, we are increasing our local footprint to better serve the market by continuously expanding our local innovation and production capabilities.

XIE: The optimization of the COVID-19 measures could set the stage for an earlier-than-expected recovery of China's economy. It is almost a consensus that China's economy will embrace an overall recovery in 2023. Recent market consensus for China's GDP growth this year is between 5.0 percent and 5.7 percent. Our outlook for the country's economy remains positive, as China is the only country in the world that has all the industrial categories listed in the UN industrial classification and is the world's largest producer of over 220 types of industrial products. It enjoys complete and stable industrial and supply chains. Even in the very tough last year, China's economy showed remarkable resilience.

AGARWAL: In the first nine months of 2022, Henkel delivered a strong business performance globally. China is the third-largest market for Henkel and the Chinese economy continues to show resilience. Locally, we are proud of the contributions made to the overall growth of our business.

Over the years, China has been providing significant support for global industrial and supply chains, creating a stable and sound environment for growth for multinationals like Henkel.

Looking at 2023, we believe in the potential, resilience and long-term sustainability of the Chinese economy. Moving forward, we will continue to invest in China to accelerate impactful local innovations and strengthen end-to-end capabilities, combining our global experience in sustainability to support our customers and consumers in China.

MACCORMAC: We expect to see recovery in the aviation sector in China over the coming months, and we are confident that our industry will benefit significantly from the new policies in 2023.Aviation connects people and businesses around the world and is essential to support growth globally. We have already seen a recovery in international travel elsewhere in the world as countries have lifted travel restrictions. As we enter 2023, when China is poised to reconnect internationally, we are confident we will see a strong recovery in China as well."

Paris, 23 February 2023 – TotalEnergies has signed Corporate Power Purchase Agreements (CPPA) with Sasol South Africa and Air Liquide Large Industries South Africa for the supply of 260 MW capacity of renewable electricity over 20 years.

TotalEnergies will develop a 120 MW solar plant and a 140 MW windfarm in the Northern Cape province to supply around 850 GWh of green electricity per year to the Sasol’s Secunda site, located 700 kilometers further North-East, where Air Liquide operates the biggest oxygen production site in the world.

The two projects will provide competitive and available renewable electricity to decarbonize Sasol and Air Liquide’s production. These agreements demonstrate TotalEnergies’ positioning to contribute to the evolution of the energy mix in South Africa. The projects will have a direct impact on the local community through job creations.

“Power generation in South Africa is still 80% based on coal and power cuts occur daily. With these developments we are proud to support Air Liquide and Sasol for their supply of green electricity. Meanwhile, we are pleased to contribute to South Africa’s energy transition which consists of increasing its share of renewables and gas as an alternative to coal” said Vincent Stoquart, Senior Vice President, Renewables at TotalEnergies. “There is a dynamic market for corporate PPAs in South Africa and we want TotalEnergies to take a strong leadership position.”

The two projects are expected to be operational in 2025. The CPPAs with SASOL and Air Liquide were signed with a consortium of TotalEnergies Marketing South Africa1 (70%), its partner Mulilo (17%) and a to-be-announced B-BBEE partner (13%).

These projects are subject to regulatory approvals.

(1) TotalEnergies Marketing South Africa is a South African registered company of TotalEnergies (50.1%) and a number of South african BBBEE investors (49.9%).

This is the second set of PPAs signed by Air Liquide and Sasol, after the PPAs announced in January with Enel Green Power for a capacity of 220 MW. Together, these PPAs represent a total of 480 MW of the joint commitment by Air Liquide and Sasol to pursue the procurement of a total capacity of 900 MW of renewable energy. These will significantly contribute to the decarbonization of the Secunda site.

Within the framework of these agreements with Air Liquide and Sasol, TotalEnergies and Mulilo will create one local majority owned wind project with a capacity of 140 MW and one local majority owned solar project with a capacity of 120 MW. These projects are scheduled to be operational in 2025. This agreement is subject to regulatory and financial approvals.

Ronnie Chalmers, Vice President and Executive Committee Member of the Air Liquide Group, in charge of Africa Middle East & India, said:

Not only will these renewable energy capacities significantly contribute to the decarbonisation of our operations in Secunda, where we operate the biggest oxygen production site in the world, they will also actively support the development of renewable energies in South Africa, for the benefit of the South African electrical power system and ultimately of the South African society. In line with Air Liquide’s ADVANCE strategic plan, which includes reducing its absolute CO2 emissions by 33% by 2035, these PPAs also demonstrate the Group’s capacity to collaborate with its customers to provide solutions which contribute to the decarbonization of its assets as well as of its clients.

In April 2021, Air Liquide and Sasol launched a joint initiative to procure a total of 900 MW of renewable energy for their operations in Secunda, with an allocation of 500 MW to Sasol and 400 MW to Air Liquide. The two companies are negotiating additional PPAs to complete the balance of the renewable energy requested.

Air Liquide acquired Sasol’s 16 oxygen production units in Secunda and has been operating them since June 2021, in the framework of a long-term supply contract with its long-term partner. Including another Air Separation Unit (ASU) it already operated for Sasol, Air Liquide thus now operates a total of 17 ASUs in Secunda, with a total capacity of 47,000 tonnes/day of oxygen. Air Liquide plans to reduce by 30 % to 40 % the CO2 emissions (Scope 2) arising from its operations on the Secunda site through a multi-year investment and modernization plan and a steep increase of the site’s procurement in renewable energies."

Meanwhile, the South Africans’ confidence that a climate crisis would be averted in their lifetime has declined from 58.9% in 2021 to 56.6% last year, according to the second annual Epson Climate Reality Barometer released this week.

The survey measured the opinions and experiences of South Africans as part of a global study by Epson into the causes and possible mitigations to climate change around the world. Timothy Thomas, country manager, Epson South Africa said the 2021 survey explored the various contributing factors to climate change and humanity’s ability to deal with it effectively, from scientific and government interventions to a slow uptake of renewable energy. “This year’s survey focused on the actions that individuals have taken, or intend to take, to help tackle climate change, from less international business and leisure travel, to switching to an electric vehicle, walking or cycling more, switching to renewable energy and using more sustainable brands,” Thomas said.

Globally, climate change was on average ranked third as a priority issue that governments, companies and individuals should be focussed on. However, in South Africa, it was ranked fourth at 9.4% behind fixing the economy at 40%, tackling poverty at 19.9% and managing inflation at 14%. Epson said the findings also suggested that age was a factor, with the oldest age range (55+) most concerned about climate change(over 15%) and those in the 45 to 54 and 16 to 24 age range at under 7% each the least concerned. This was despite the impact of climate change witnessed in recent years, including intense rains affecting the eastern coast of South Africa, resulting in increased devastating flooding and landslides across KwaZulu-Natal and widespread ongoing droughts across the Eastern and Western Cape."

Sasol and Air Liquide large-scale renewable-energy project.



Location

The wind turbines are to be installed in the Kouga municipality and the Oyster Bay local municipality, about 15 km from Humansdorp, in the Eastern Cape, in South Africa, and wheeled over the national grid.



Project Owner/s

Synfuel producer Sasol and industrial gas and services provider Air Liquide.



The companies are acting jointly, following the R8.5-billion acquisition by Air Liquide in July 2020, of Sasol’s air separation units (ASUs) at the Secunda site, in Mpumalanga, which are fully integrated into the chemicals and energy complex.



Project Description

Sasol and Air Liquide formally announced plans in April 2021 to jointly procure 900 MW of renewable-energy capacity from independent power producers (IPPs) by 2030.



During the initial procurement phase, Air Liquide will procure 400 MW and Sasol 200 MW, while the individual projects must demonstrate a generation capacity of at least 70 MW, which will position them to produce about 200 GWh/y of electricity.



The transaction represents the biggest renewable-energy procurement deal by the private sector in South Africa. The renewable electricity generated by the IPPs will supply Sasol’s operations in Secunda.



Both companies have committed to reducing their greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions. The emission-reduction commitment, which was unveiled in 2021, has been made against a 2017 baseline of 63.9-million carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) tons and implies a reduction to 44.7-million CO2e tons by 2030.



The group has also pledged to be a net-zero emissions company by 2050.



Potential Job Creation

Not stated.



Capital Expenditure

Meridian Economics estimates that the project will require an investment of between R12-billion and R13-billion, excluding the financing costs during construction.



Planned Start/End Date

The renewable electricity from the projects is scheduled to be operational in 2025.



Latest Developments

Sasol CEO Fleetwood Grobler has said that it has signed five power purchase agreements (PPAs) in South Africa to date, increasing the company’s procurement of renewable energy for its South African operations to 550 MW.

Further agreements are expected to be concluded this year, in line with its goal of procuring 1 200 MW of renewable electricity by 2030.

Speaking during the release of the company’s interim results on February 21, Grobler confirmed that a further 260 MW of wind and solar electricity had been procured in partnership with Air Liquide, which operates 16 oxygen production units at Sasol’s Secunda complex.

In a joint announcement, Sasol and Air Liquide reported that PPAs for wind and solar electricity had been signed with TotalEnergies and its partner Mulilo, which would build a 140 MW wind project and a 120 MW solar project and that the generators would be operational in 2025.

In January, the two companies also signed two PPAs with Enel Green Power for 220 MW of wind capacity as part of a commitment to jointly procure 900 MW, with Sasol procuring 500 MW and Air Liquide the 400 MW balance. To date, Sasol and Air Liquide have now jointly procured 480 MW.

Also in January, Sasol signed a PPA with the Msenge Emoyeni Wind Farm, in the Eastern Cape, for the supply of 69 MW to its Sasolburg site, in the Free State, where Sasol will use the renewable electricity to produce green hydrogen from water using an electrolyser.

The six-ton-a-day electrolyser is expected to be operational later this year and aims to use the green hydrogen produced to pilot various use cases, including various transport applications.

“Once these renewables projects are operational, they could reduce our Scope 2 emissions by approximately 1.8-million tons per annum,” Grobler told investors.

He also reported that Sasol and Topsoe had signed a memorandum of understanding to establish a 50/50 joint venture (JV) in 2023 to develop sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) solutions.

“The JV will develop, build, own and operate ventures producing SAF based on Sasol’s Fischer Tropsch technology and Topsoe’s relevant SAF technologies,” Grobler said.

Meanwhile, CFO Hanré Rossouw announced the establishment of Sasol Ventures, a chemicals-focused venture capital fund through which the group would invest €50-million over the next five years.

Sasol has partnered with Emerald Technology Ventures on the initiative and Sasol Ventures will pursue investments in startup and early-stage technologies that could support the South Africa group’s decarbonisation ambitions.

Sasol has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030 and has set a goal of becoming net-zero by 2050."
