Air Liquide will invest around 100 million euros towards the construction of a world-scale Air Separation Unit (ASU) on the site, where it already operates two other ASUs. Designed to use low carbon energy, this state of the art plant will allow to significantly reduce CO2 emissions over time. This new ASU will also be a new source of krypton and xenon to address the growing demand of the Electronics industry, as well as other air gases for our industrial merchant activity in China.

Under a 20 year-long contract, Air Liquide will build, own and operate a new state-of-the-art ASU with a daily capacity of 3,800 tonnes of oxygen. It is the largest single ASU for the steel industry in the world, as well as Air Liquide’s largest ASU in China. When the new unit starts up at the end of 2023, it will bring the total installed oxygen capacity to over 8,000 tonnes per day on the site.

The new ASU is equipped with the proprietary solution AliveTM, an innovation that allows for the storage of up to 60 MW of energy per day, enabling flexibility in the grid and contributing to a higher reliability of gas supply. Replacing old assets installed on the customer site, and using an incremental proportion of low-carbon energy, this new ASU will contribute to a lower carbon footprint for this flagship site, in line with Air Liquide’s journey towards carbon neutrality.

This ASU will be a key source of krypton and xenon for Air Liquide, addressing the growing demand of the Electronics industry. The Zhangjiagang site will also become Air Liquide’s largest liquid oxygen and nitrogen source in China, with its Ultra Purity Oxygen capacity positioning it strategically to support small-and-medium sized customers of liquid and packaged gases, including local hospitals requiring high-purity medical gases, in East China.

François Abrial, Member of the Air Liquide Group’s Executive Committee supervising Asia Pacific, said :

This new contract further enhances Air Liquide and Shagang Group’s long-term partnership which was established in 2007. With this state-of-the-art low carbon plant, we are committed to leveraging our innovative solutions to help our customers reduce the carbon footprint of steel-making and other industries. This is a new illustration of our commitment to act for a sustainable future and reach carbon neutrality by 2050.

Shen Wenrong, Chairman of Jiangsu Shagang Group, said :"
Air Liquide transforms its network in Germany by connecting a large electrolyzer producing renewable hydrogen - Air Liquide,"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5haXJsaXF1aWRlLmNvbS9ncm91cC9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy1uZXdzLzIwMjEtMDctMjkvYWlyLWxpcXVpZGUtdHJhbnNmb3Jtcy1pdHMtbmV0d29yay1nZXJtYW55LWNvbm5lY3RpbmctbGFyZ2UtZWxlY3Ryb2x5emVyLXByb2R1Y2luZy1yZW5ld2FibGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide is planning to build in Oberhausen, Germany, a renewable hydrogen production plant by electrolysis. With a total capacity to reach 30 megawatts (MW), a first phase of the project is expected to be operational by early 2023 with 20 MW. What is unique about this project is that the electrolyzer will be integrated into the existing local pipeline infrastructure of Air Liquide to supply key industries and mobility with renewable hydrogen in one of the most industrialized regions of Germany. To accelerate the implementation of this project, public funding has been granted by the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy. This worldscale electrolyzer will be the first to be built in the framework of the partnership between Air Liquide and Siemens Energy.

The new Proton-Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyzer to be built by Air Liquide will produce renewable hydrogen from water and renewable electricity. The technological solution for the project is being developed in the framework of the previously announced partnership between Air Liquide and Siemens Energy. By 2023, the two partners will implement a 20 MW electrolyzer plant that will produce renewable hydrogen and renewable oxygen. In a second phase, Air Liquide has planned to increase the plant capacity to 30MW.

The PEM electrolysis is expected to start operating in early 2023 and will be the first large-scale renewable hydrogen production connected to both existing hydrogen and oxygen pipelines, with nearly 15 large industrial sites already connected today. This will support sectors such as Steel, Chemicals, Refining and Mobility in North Rhine-Westphalia by accelerating the availability of gases produced with renewable electricity for their efforts to reduce their carbon footprint.

This project has received a funding notification from the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy. Elisabeth Winkelmeier-Becker, Parliamentary State Secretary at the Federal Ministry of Economics, stated:

With the National Hydrogen Strategy we have taken a decisive step towards the further development of the energy transition. At the same time, the market ramp-up of the H2 economy offers great economic opportunities, especially after the impact of the Corona Pandemic. The Ministry of Economics has therefore been working at full speed for a year to create the regulatory and legal framework. Now we need concrete and ambitious projects. The project of Air Liquide in Germany has a showcase character in this context. It demonstrates how ""green"" hydrogen can be used to sustainably transform industry as well as certain transport sectors. At the same time, the project is a strong signal for the positioning of the Rhine-Ruhr region in the hydrogen sector.

François Jackow, Executive Vice President and a member of the Air Liquide Group’s Executive Committee supervising Europe Industries activities, said:"

Hytrucks to deploy 1000 H2 trucks by 2025 - www.electrive.com,"Mon, 05 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsZWN0cml2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNy8wNS9oeXRydWNrcy10by1kZXBsb3ktMTAwMC1oMi10cnVja3MtYnktMjAyNS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A consortium called HyTrucks has been formed by Hyzon Motors, Air Liquide and DATS 24 along with the ports of Rotterdam, Antwerp and Duisburg. Hytrucks has pledged to deploy 1,000 H2 trucks and 25 H2 refuelling stations by 2025.

The HyTrucks partners note their initiative is one of the largest European projects to deploy zero-emission heavy-duty fleets in the most traffic-intensive areas of Europe. The 25 planned hydrogen refuelling stations will be distributed to create a reliable network between Antwerp, Rotterdam and Duisburg. The project aims to contribute to zero-emission trucking between the Netherlands, Belgium and western Germany.

In May this year, the Port of Antwerp said that as part of the Hytrucks initiative, 300 of the 1,000 H2 trucks would be stationed in Belgium, indicating that the initiative will start there. As yet, nothing has been made public about the share of hydrogen fuel cell trucks in Germany and the exact role of the Port of Duisburg. In announcing its part in the initiative, the Port of Antwerp noted that HyTrucks is considered an “important project of common European interest” (IPCEI) and thus qualifies for special funding at various levels.

“We are convinced of the central role hydrogen will play in the energy transition, especially in heavy-duty applications,” says Diederick Luijten, Vice President Hydrogen Energy Europe at consortium partner Air Liquide.

The initiative represents a significant and foreseeable demand for hydrogen trucks from Hyzon Motors. The company says: “The project has tapped Hyzon as a key supplier of hydrogen heavy trucks for the initiative.” Hyzon Motors CEO Craig Knight says “Collaboration will be central to this effort and key to scaling hydrogen mobility solutions worldwide so we’re excited to join the prominent members of HyTrucks and to supply our proven zero-emission heavy trucks.”

Hyzon Motors recently joined a project by the Dutch province of Utrecht to deploy a total of 1,800 hydrogen vehicles and up to ten hydrogen refuelling stations by 2025. The US-based company also says they are a member of a European consortium of automotive companies that plans to deploy up to 100,000 H2 trucks by 2030 as a common goal. The company did not give further information about this consortium.

Towards the end of last year, a new common-interest alliance from Daimler Truck, Iveco, OMV, Shell and the Volvo Group called H2Accelerate (H2A) announced that it will be aiming to help hydrogen trucks achieve a breakthrough across Europe. However, these European partners have far less ambitious goals than Hytrucks and Hyzon Motors: first in the second half of the 2020s, Hy2Accelerate will still only be aiming for four-digit production figures, “followed by a rapid increase in volume to over 10,000 H2 trucks”. Hyzon Motors is already looking at four-digit production figures right now.

Even besides the above-named projects in Utrecht, Hyzon Motors is looking at four-digit production figures in New Zealand, where Hiringa Energy is ordering a total of 1,500 fuel cell trucks over the next five years till 2026. This is one of the company’s collaborative initiatives involving actors from different parts of the Hydrogen ecosystem called the Hyzon Zero Carbon Alliance.

European Ports are not the only ports to be taking decisive steps towards hydrogen technology for port operations and heavy-duty fuel cell vehicles. Just last month, the Port of Los Angeles announced that it is now deploying five new hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and the opening of two hydrogen fueling stations with partners that include Toyota, Kenworth Trucks and Shell.

The Hytrucks initiative here in Europe is a significant one. Just one of the three ports in involved in the initiative – the Port of Rotterdam – is the largest seaport in Europe and the largest outside of Asia.

Beijing becomes home to the world’s largest hydrogen station with the deployment of an installation with a capacity of nearly 5 tonnes supply per day. Owned and operated by Beijing Hypower Energy Technology Ltd., the Daxing hydrogen station can refuel 600 hydrogen fuel cell vehicles a day, including cargo vans, garbage trucks and buses.

Air Liquide Houpu Hydrogen Equipment Co., Ltd, a subsidiary of Air Liquide Group, supplied and installed 8 hydrogen dispenser units for the Daxing station, which is part of the 200,000 m2 Beijing International Hydrogen Energy Demonstration Zone.

Accommodating a technology park, a test base and other function areas, this demonstration zone, open to the public, aims to build an innovation ecosystem that integrates research & development, test and production related to hydrogen energy. An exhibition hall was installed and inaugurated on July 8 to provide an immersive experience of hydrogen energy for the public.

China is scaling up several fuel cell vehicle projects in 5 priority provinces and 10 major cities, actively developing a low-carbon sustainable automobile industry, says Air Liquide.

Air Liquide in China operates nearly 120 plants. With a strong presence in the key coastal industrial areas, the company is now expanding into the center, south and west. Air Liquide Houpu is a joint-venture between Air Liquide and Houpu established in 2019, focusing on manufacture, sales, research and developing the equipment of hydrogen refueling stations.

Sower said that driver safety philosophy begins during the hiring process. “It’s not enough for us to just look at whether or not they have a good roadway safety performance record. It’s also a cultural fit,” Sower said. “It’s really about us feeling comfortable that they are going to come in and enhance our safety performance and service performance for the customer. Our drivers are the face of the company to our customer base.”

He added that there is a lot of responsibility when it comes to hauling gases. “We really try to appeal to the greater sense of morality and sense of responsibility to our driver base,” Sower said. “It makes them feel more like they’re part of something that matters as opposed to just a driver job.”

That sense of teamwork was tested—and enhanced—during the pandemic, Freeman said. “COVID required us to relook at what we were doing and how we were doing it,” he explained. “We all adapted quite well to meet the needs of both our customers and the demands of the industry. We’ve gone through the worst of it, and we’re on the other side, all the better.”"

TotalEnergies (Paris:TTE) (LSE:TTE) (NYSE:TTE):

Launched in late 2019, the Coalition for the Energy of the Future aims at accelerating the development of future energies and technologies to sustain new green mobility models and reduce the impact of transport and logistics on climate change.

Launch of the feasibility study of the first French project of BioLNG production within a large maritime port

On the occasion of its second CEO meeting of 2021, the Coalition for the Energy of the Future announces the launch of the feasibility study of the first French project of BioLNG production within a large maritime port. Developed by three of its members, this project will enable to advance the production and use of BioLNG for maritime transportation.

Made possible by the Coalition’s work, this project will allow the transformation of household waste from the Métropole Aix-Marseille-Provence into liquefied biomethane (BioLNG) within the Port of Marseille Fos. This BioLNG will then be used to advance green mobility from the port, notably for the CMA CGM Group’s LNG-powered vessels.

This major project represents a virtuous example of circular economy and will benefit from existing infrastructures at the Port of Marseille Fos: EveRé’s (a household waste treatment center) methanation units, Elengy’s (a subsidiary of ENGIE) LNG terminals for stocking and delivery, TotalEnergies’ bunkering ship and CMA CGM’s LNG vessels.

BioLNG combined with CMA CGM vessels’ dual fuel engines will allow the reduction of at least 67% greenhouse gas emissions on a well-to-wake basis (entire value chain) and by 88% on a tank-to-wake basis (at ship level).

Air Liquide to build and operate for Shagang a low carbon gas plant which is also the world's largest for the steel ... - PR Newswire Asia,"Fri, 09 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFodHRwczovL2VuLnBybmFzaWEuY29tL3JlbGVhc2VzL2FwYWMvYWlyLWxpcXVpZGUtdG8tYnVpbGQtYW5kLW9wZXJhdGUtZm9yLXNoYWdhbmctYS1sb3ctY2FyYm9uLWdhcy1wbGFudC13aGljaC1pcy1hbHNvLXRoZS13b3JsZC1zLWxhcmdlc3QtZm9yLXRoZS1zdGVlbC1pbmR1c3RyeS0zMjUyNjEuc2h0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, July 9, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Air Liquide and Jiangsu Shagang Group, the largest private steel enterprise in China and one of top 5 globally[1], have signed a new long-term agreement for the supply of industrial gases in Zhangjiagang City, Jiangsu Province, China. Air Liquide will invest around 100 million euros towards the construction of a world-scale Air Separation Unit (ASU) on the site, where it already operates two other ASUs. Designed to use low carbon energy, this state of the art plant will allow to significantly reduce CO 2 emissions over time. This new ASU will also be a new source of krypton and xenon to address the growing demand of the Electronics industry, as well as other air gases for our industrial merchant activity in China.



Air Seperation Units of Air Liquide

Under a 20 year-long contract, Air Liquide will build, own and operate a new state-of-the-art ASU with a daily capacity of 3,800 tonnes of oxygen. It is the largest single ASU for the steel industry in the world, as well as Air Liquide's largest ASU in China. When the new unit starts up at the end of 2023, it will bring the total installed oxygen capacity to over 8,000 tonnes per day on the site.

The new ASU is equipped with the proprietary solution AliveTM, an innovation that allows for the storage of up to 60 MW of energy per day, enabling flexibility in the grid and contributing to a higher reliability of gas supply. Replacing old assets installed on the customer site, and using an incremental proportion of low-carbon energy, this new ASU will contribute to a lower carbon footprint for this flagship site, in line with Air Liquide's journey towards carbon neutrality.

This ASU will be a key source of krypton and xenon for Air Liquide, addressing the growing demand of the Electronics industry. The Zhangjiagang site will also become Air Liquide's largest liquid oxygen and nitrogen source in China, with its Ultra Purity Oxygen capacity positioning it strategically to support small-and-medium sized customers of liquid and packaged gases, including local hospitals requiring high-purity medical gases, in East China.

Francois Abrial, Member of the Air Liquide Group's Executive Committee supervising Asia Pacific, said, ""This new contract further enhances Air Liquide and Shagang Group's long-term partnership which was established in 2007. With this state-of-the-art low carbon plant, we are committed to leveraging our innovative solutions to help our customers reduce the carbon footprint of steel-making and other industries. This is a new illustration of our commitment to act for a sustainable future and reach carbon neutrality by 2050.""

Industry: when proximity leads to innovation and agility - Air Liquide,"Wed, 21 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvaW5kdXN0cnkvaW5kdXN0cnktd2hlbi1wcm94aW1pdHktbGVhZHMtaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi1hbmQtYWdpbGl0edIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The health crisis has put pressure on production and logistics chains in many sectors. Air Liquide supports manufacturers in their quest for agility, competitiveness and sustainable solutions thanks to its unique strengths: technological expertise, in-depth knowledge of customer processes, its presence at the heart of local economies… And its ability to innovate relentlessly.

A privileged position to anticipate trends Serving more than 2 million customers around the world, from craftsmen to SMEs and large companies, Air Liquide contributes to nearly every sector of the economy: food, pharmaceuticals, energy, chemicals, automotive, aeronautics and more. The Group is at the forefront of detecting market changes and anticipating the needs that will transform industrial production methods. It is constantly investing to support its customers in their geographical development while offering them innovative solutions that improve the industrial and environmental performance of their processes. This dynamic is reflected in the signing of several long-term contracts in 2020 with major industrial players in mature economies (United States, Europe) and developing economies (China, Russia). Constantly adapting to customer needs Air Liquide's key assets for advancing industry are its close proximity to its customers and its in-depth knowledge of their industrial processes, which enables it to maximize the full potential of the molecules it supplies and to design innovative equipment. Indeed, the Group is constantly transforming itself to better understand and meet the needs of its customers and respond to them more effectively, even in difficult conditions. For example, SRF, a customer in India specializing in technical textiles and packaging films, wants to become autonomous in its supply and have greater flexibility. Two advantages of Air Liquide’s on-site gas production solution that met the customer’s expectations. In 2020, despite the many restrictions resulting from the health crisis, multidisciplinary teams worked together on-site and remotely to successfully install and commission a nitrogen production unit at the customer’s site in the Dahei region. This 2,000 m 3 /h capacity unit provides SRF with a continuously reliable nitrogen supply, with enhanced safety conditions, and also meet its need for autonomy. And at a cost that is significantly more competitive than the market price. Air Liquide’s success in this project illustrates the advantages of on-site gas production which has steadily increased, a growth particularly driven by China and the United States. After a record year in 2019 with 40 on-site production contracts, the Group signed 45 new contracts in 2020. In addition to the sales stability provided by these 10 to 15 year long-term agreements, they also help to reduce the Group’s carbon footprint as there is no gas to liquefy or transport to the customer, resulting in less CO2 emissions. For industrial companies, these on-site gas production solutions mean autonomy, reliability as well as being environmentally friendly. Ultimately, on-site gas production solutions offer flexibility and competitiveness.

“ If the sales of on-site production units continue to grow, it is because they fully meet our customers’ new requirements: the need for competitiveness and the reduction of CO2 emissions. It also shows that our customers recognize our technological expertise in this field. ” Matthieu Giard Member of the Air Liquide Executive Committee and Vice President, Industrial Merchant business line

Digital technology providing greater proactivity Competitiveness that the Group wants to further strengthen using digital technologies. Air Liquide is experiencing profound change thanks to digital technology, which drives performance and innovation. Digital technology powers the Group’s working methods at all levels of the organization. It now permeates the solutions provided to customers, such as the Integrated Bulk Operations program that has been rolled out worldwide. Air Liquide’s ambition is to improve customer service by optimizing the liquid gas supply chain end-to-end, using digital technologies and mass data collection from the production site to the customer’s site.





This solution has already proven itself in North America, where Air Liquide Canada has become a pioneer in the field. The entity now has 95% of its assets connected and already operates two-thirds of its liquid gas business using these technologies. How does it work? Customer consumption and molecule availability data are analyzed in-depth and driver routes are optimized, all in real time. This also has several advantages: the logistics teams anticipate customer requests, identify the most competitive molecules and adapt them to customers’ needs, in order to organize more efficient and reliable delivery rounds. The supply chain becomes more agile and CO2 emissions are reduced.

The Integrated Bulk Operations program is revolutionizing the liquid gas supply chain







This program is based on four principles: predictive customer demand analysis, gas supply optimization, more efficient management of truck routes and real-time information on customer deliveries. The digital connection of supply chain assets – from production sites to trucks to customers’ on-site tanks – enables data reporting and analysis to improve the customer experience, operating performance and carbon footprint. A logistics revolution for the liquid gas business, which generates 27% of Industrial Merchant activity revenue (8,959 million euros in 2020) and supplies a variety of markets such as food, electronics, glass and metals industries. Continuing strategic investments This same quest to drive performance for its customers has led Air Liquide, despite the crisis context, to continue its strategic investments in several regions. In the United States, for example, the Group has strengthened its positions in Texas with the conclusion of long-term contracts with Eastman Chemical Company and Steel Dynamics, two of the region's major players, specialized in steel and chemicals. These contracts cover the supply of oxygen, nitrogen and argon to these customers thanks to the construction of state-of-the art and energy efficient air separation units (ASU). Air Liquide has also invested in Europe, where it has signed several long-term agreements with BASF, a world leader in chemicals, thus strengthening its strategic positioning in the Antwerp industrial basin in Belgium. The Group has also reinforced its industrial presence in Russia and Poland through long-term partnerships with steel producer NLMK and copper and silver manufacturer KGHM Polska Miedź. In China, Air Liquide continues its development with the construction of a new ASU in the port area of Tianjin, which will allow the Group to support the growth of the region's industrial players. These investments underline Air Liquide's commitment to support its major customers in their transition to safer, more reliable and sustainable technological solutions. They also demonstrate the Group's confidence in the growth of the industry and its transition to cleaner and more efficient methods of production. The search for quality, reliability and performance, the need for supply autonomy, reduction of environmental impact… By working ever more closely with manufacturers and listening to their needs, the Group is inventing with them more efficient solutions. Industrial activities at Air Liquide







Industrial gases is an historical core business for Air Liquide. This activity is organized in two business lines: the Large Industries business line serves customers in the metals, chemicals, refining and energy sectors. It supplies them with gas and energy solutions for their industrial production, solutions which are designed to improve the efficiency of the processes and the environmental footprint of their plants. Meanwhile, the Industrial Merchant business line provides comprehensive gas solutions to a wide range of customers – craftsmen, SMEs, large companies – in sectors as diverse as food, the pharmaceutical industry, aeronautics and automotive construction."

London Is on Board With England's First Hydrogen-Powered Double-Deckers - TriplePundit,"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyaXBsZXB1bmRpdC5jb20vc3RvcnkvMjAyMS9sb25kb24taHlkcm9nZW4tZG91YmxlLWRlY2tlci83MjU5MTHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A fleet of 20 hydrogen double-decker buses has been released onto the streets of London to help cut toxic fumes and tackle climate change.

In what is believed to be a first for England, the £12m hydrogen double-decker buses are being introduced on the number 7 route in the capital, running between East Acton and Oxford Circus.

Wrightbus has manufactured the new zero-emission buses and the hydrogen will be produced at a facility in Cheshire. From 2023, the Air Liquide facility in Runcorn will be converted to produce only green hydrogen (using electrolysis powered by renewable energy).

Aberdeen already has hydrogen buses operating and more are expected to be rolled out in Bristol, with each bus needing to refuel once a day.

Transport for London’s (TfL) other business partners for the new hydrogen fleet are gas cylinder manufacturer Luxfer, and Nel Hydrogen, which has installed a refuelling station at an Ealing bus depot.

TfL’s sustainability goal is to operate only zero-emission vehicles by 2030.

Geoff Hobbs, TfL’s interim director of buses, said: “London may have one of the cleanest bus fleets in Europe, but we need to continue to act now to tackle climate change and the city’s toxic air quality.

“Introducing these hydrogen double-decker buses to our fleet, alongside electric buses, diversifies our green bus portfolio and helps us use the right technology for the varying operational requirements of our vast network. This will help Londoners breathe cleaner air.

“Our investment in hydrogen won’t just benefit London, either. Outside the capital, we are supporting jobs across the UK and our involvement with the industry across Europe is making cleaner fuels more affordable to cities all over Europe.”

TfL is also ploughing investment into electric models, with more than 500 electric buses currently in operation, while other buses have been retrofitted to meet the Euro VI emissions standard.

Funding for the new hydrogen buses, which were launched by London mayor Sadiq Khan, has been jointly provided by TfL, the UK Government’s Office of Zero-Emission Vehicles and two European bodies – the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking, and the Innovation and Networks Executive Agency (INEA).

It is predicted that hydrogen will account for a quarter of final energy consumption in road transport globally by 2050, according to a recent report by Bloomberg Intelligence.

The UK Government’s National Bus Strategy will result in a ban on new diesel bus sales, with consultations underway to support bus manufacturers and operators and it is aiming to deliver 4,000 British-built electric and hydrogen buses over the course of this Parliament.

Tom Linebarger takes over the role from Takeshi Uchiyamada, Chairman of Toyota Motor Corporation, whose two-year mandate has come to an end, but who will remain an active member of the Board of the Hydrogen Council.

Benoît Potier, Chairman and CEO of Air Liquide and Co-chair of the Hydrogen Council.

We are delighted to welcome new members to the Hydrogen Council, coming from a wide range of geographies and sectors.

“Their joining confirms that the interest in hydrogen is coming from across many sectors of the economy, and is turning into a priority for actors committed to energy transition. I look forward to working alongside Cummins as new Co-chair to foster dialogue and collaboration in order to accelerate the development of a low carbon economy.”

Tom Linebarger, Chairman and CEO of Cummins and new Co-chair of the Hydrogen Council, added:

It’s encouraging to see major economies around the world advance clean energy technologies, and I’m especially proud that the United States is pushing forward with new policy initiatives to support the scale-up of hydrogen.

“As the new Co-chair of the Hydrogen Council, I’m eager to work with all of our members to accelerate hydrogen deployment globally through strong international partnerships.”

Multigas announces launch of new nitrogen production plant - Times of Malta,"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZm1hbHRhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL211bHRpZ2FzLWFubm91bmNlcy1sYXVuY2gtb2YtbmV3LW5pdHJvZ2VuLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tcGxhbnQuODg2MTgw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Multigas Ltd., a leading producer and distributor of industrial and medical gases based in Kirkop, has recently installed and commissioned a new Air Separation Plant. This second plant will significantly add to Multigas’ production capacity of nitrogen and is part of a long-term agreement with Air Liquide Italia – the Italian affiliate of the French multinational Air Liquide Group – to supply their customers with this gas.

The new plant produces liquid nitrogen and oxygen through the cryogenic air separation process. The installation is equipped with the latest technology for production control and reliability together with environmental considerations such as noise abatement. The multi-million Euro project also included an investment in electrical supply switchgear, cooling water systems and product storage.

The market disruption brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant product shortages in the region. The new plant is therefore proving critical to ensuring business continuity to customers including the healthcare sector.

Multigas and Air Liquide Italia’s successful collaboration stretches back several years, to the 1980s, and has supported Multigas’ commitment to provide a secure and robust supply of gases to the Maltese industrial and healthcare sectors.

Ing. Michael Mifsud, CEO of Multigas, said: “This project enables us to take our service offering to a new level, providing a robust supply chain and peace of mind to our customers. We thank our counterparts at Air Liquide and our dedicated team of employees and partners who have worked tirelessly to bring this project to a successful completion notwithstanding the challenges brought about by a world-wide pandemic.”"
