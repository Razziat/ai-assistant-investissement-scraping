Bringing collaboration and flexibility at the office - Air Liquide,"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvdGFsZW50cy9icmluZ2luZy1jb2xsYWJvcmF0aW9uLWFuZC1mbGV4aWJpbGl0eS1vZmZpY2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Since 2020, working patterns in Air Liquide have changed. The Group has adopted new remote and virtual ways of working and shifted from a full-time office to a hybrid model. That is why it is more important than ever that our offices reflect this change and can meet the new needs of our teams.

Deploying an activity-based workspace

For the past three years, Air Liquide has been successfully developing and implementing a new office strategy. Called ""Activity-based workplace"", it recognizes that through the course of any day, employees engage in many different activities. They need and can choose different types of workspaces to accommodate these activities. This variety takes into account different tasks, work styles, preferences and personalities of employees. Such new workplaces range from lounge-style collaboration spaces to meeting rooms with writable surfaces for brainstorming or phone booths for private calls.

Such a concept is already a reality in Brazil, the United Arab Emirates, Spain, France, Australia, Argentina, the United States of America and soon in Germany, Italy and more.

Making the workplaces more inclusive and diverse for all employees

The choice was made to prioritize high-quality spaces keeping the office in the heart of the work ecosystem and achieving positive environmental and social impacts.

The aim is to make the workplaces more inclusive and diverse for all employees, to create a collaborative and creative atmosphere that fosters employee well-being, maximizes productivity, provides opportunities for peer-to-peer learning and developing interactions.

Hydrogen mobility for heavy-duty: Air Liquide and Faurecia are on the case! - Faurecia,"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhdXJlY2lhLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzcm9vbS9oeWRyb2dlbi1tb2JpbGl0eS1oZWF2eS1kdXR5LWFpci1saXF1aWRlLWFuZC1mYXVyZWNpYS1hcmUtY2FzZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Texte

The driving force behind the Air Liquide & Faurecia partnership

It all started with a shared conviction: liquid hydrogen is an effective solution to decarbonize heavy-duty transportation (trucks), which accounts for 6% of CO2 emissions worldwide. However, manufacturers must accomplish their energy transitions without sacrificing economic imperatives and the user experience. They need their vehicles to continue to meet certain industry requirements, including long ranges, route flexibility and large payloads. The solution? Bring hydrogen —nearly 80 kg of it— on board.

Since liquid hydrogen is twice as dense, it can be stored in tanks of comparable size to conventional systems while providing a similar range (a big requirement for manufacturers and fleet operators), and can enable up to 1,000 km of travel on a single tank of liquid hydrogen. In addition, refilling a single tank of liquid hydrogen should take about 10 minutes, which is comparable to a diesel vehicle.

“The arrival of this energy carrier is a small revolution in mobility. Our expertise in hydrogen cryogenics and its value chain makes us a natural ally that can help Faurecia offer a credible solution to heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers.” Éric Prades

Director of Energy Transition Partnerships, Hydrogen Energy business line, Air Liquide

Overcoming the challenges of a low-carbon energy carrier

This partnership between Air Liquide and Faurecia aims to bring concrete solutions to heavy vehicle manufacturers and operators. Although liquid hydrogen has been around for more than 60 years, its use was reserved for specific high-tech applications such as space propulsion through the early 2010s.

In addition to making a drastic change in scale, the teams must take on a technological challenge: designing onboard tanks for extensive use that can then be mass-produced while maintaining economic viability. This is where Air Liquide and Faurecia come in. The former is a world expert in hydrogen production and liquefaction techniques and extreme cryogenics processes, the latter a global leader in automotive zero emission mobility with recognized expertise technology integration in vehicles of all sizes.

“Liquid hydrogen is an energy carrier that perfectly meets the needs of heavy-duty transportation,” notes Éric Prades, Vice-President of Energy Transition Partnerships, Hydrogen Energy World Business Line, at Air Liquide. “Our expertise in hydrogen cryogenics* and its entire value chain makes us a natural ally that can help Faurecia offer a credible low-carbon solution to heavy vehicle manufacturers and operators.”



Making the switch to liquid hydrogen for numerous transportation sectors

“Faurecia already supplies heavy vehicle manufacturers with gaseous hydrogen,” explains Pauline Chartier, Director of Strategy and Partnerships at Faurecia. “What we are looking for with Air Liquide is to add liquid hydrogen to our portfolio of hydrogen storage systems which will of course increase vehicle range, while also maintaining the flexibility that is currently provided by combustion-based solutions.” With their complementary expertise, both partners are pioneers in hydrogen solutions for mobility, offering low-carbon options to road freight carriers.

“Along with Air Liquide, Faurecia is looking to add liquid hydrogen to its portfolio of hydrogen storage solutions, which will increase the range of heavy-duty vehicles while maintaining flexibility. Pauline Chartier

Director of Strategy and Partnerships at Faurecia

In their wake, other intensive mobility sectors are taking a close interest in this energy carrier. In the short term, the railway and off-road vehicle industries (construction sites, mines, etc.) may convert their vehicles to hydrogen. In the longer term, low-carbon liquid hydrogen is a solution for decarbonizing the river and maritime transport sectors, as well as for the entire aviation sector, with the first commercial flights planned for 2035.

Public transportation and road freight account for a massive number of vehicles on the road. This represents an opportunity to develop a new liquid hydrogen supply chain, while increasing production volumes for both liquid hydrogen and onboard tanks. This strategic solution would ensure economies of scale and quickly reach a break-even point, which is essential for the successful rollout of any new technology, and would also accelerate the adoption of hydrogen for other forms of transportation.

From pilot to market: a team acting on all fronts

The partnership between Air Liquide and Faurecia dates back to October 2021. It consists of a joint team, with each company bringing their respective skills in order to take on this technological feat: storage systems, vehicle integration and scale-up (Faurecia), and hydrogen production, cryogenics and supply chain logistics (Air Liquide). The team has already completed a technological and economic feasibility study with extremely promising results on both fronts. Currently in the prototyping phase, the product is set to hit the market in 2027. By that time, the solution must be able to attract and win over vehicle manufacturers. This means that both companies need to overcome the challenges essential to the project’s success, including standardizing the dedicated supply chain (stations, connectors, tanks, etc.) and scaling up a highly complicated technology (creating and maintaining a vacuum in the tanks, initiating large-scale production). The project team is tackling these challenges on a daily basis, while ensuring compliance with standards and regulations and keeping the operator safe, issues which both groups are heavily involved in.

The targets are ambitious: with these building blocks in the assembly phase, the partnership aims to produce and market tens of thousands of tanks and install them in vehicles by 2030. In the long term, the conversion rate needs to have a sufficiently large impact in order to actively contribute to low-carbon objectives in France, as well as in Europe and the world. In 2050, 50% of zero-emission heavy vehicles should run on hydrogen.

(headquartered in Minato-ku, Tokyo; Virginie Cavalli, President & CEO; hereinafter ""Air Liquide""), as a part of the strategic collaboration on the development of a hydrogen value chain, in line with a memorandum signed by the three companies in February 2021.



The Hydrogen Refueling Station(hereinafter ""HRS""), which will be constructed on land adjacent to Enex Fleet's Motomiya Interchange Service Station in Motomiya-city,*1 Fukushima Prefecture, is scheduled to start operation in the first half of 2024 as Japan's first HRS which serves for large FC commercial vehicles*2 and operates 24 hours a day and 365 days a year. This HRS can provide services that are offered to conventional commercial viechles, such as the carwash and the rest area, for large FC commercial vehicles as well.

The three companies will continue to work together to find out more HRS opportunities with similar concept that are expected to be rolled out along with highway and to attract usage of more large scale FC commercial vehicles.



Motomiya-city, where the HRS will be located, is in the center of the Nakadori region of Fukushima Prefecture and is close proximity to an important transportation hub where the Tohoku Expressway and other highways run through it.

In Fukushima Prefecture, a demonstration project in ongoing to establish and implement energy management systems toward the popularization of electric vehicles led by Commercial Japan Partnership Technologies (headquartered in Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo; Hiroki Nakajima, President). The HRS will supply hydrogen to some of the FC commercial viechles to be operated by companies participating in the demonstration project.



The opening of the HRS is in line with the hydrogen/fuel cell strategy roadmap set out by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry with the goal of ensuring that hydrogen refueling stations are opened in 320 locations and 200,000 FCV (fuel cell-based vehicles) are in use by 2025. Fukushima Prefecture has been taking a range of steps toward the creation of a hydrogen-based society in which hydrogen is used as energy in people's lives and for industrial purposes. We believe this project of opening of a large scale hydrogen station follows these initiatives. Subsidies have been provided by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Fukushima Prefectural Government for the construction of the HRS.



Going forward, the three companies will continue to promote the development of the hydrogen market, leveraging ITOCHU's wide-ranging networks in consumer-related sectors, Air Liquide's expertise in the production and supply of hydrogen and the customer base and energy distribution systems of ITOCHU ENEX."

Many Dutch Hydrogen Projects on European Subsidy List - Hydrogen Central,"Mon, 26 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vaHlkcm9nZW4tY2VudHJhbC5jb20vbWFueS1kdXRjaC1oeWRyb2dlbi1wcm9qZWN0cy1ldXJvcGVhbi1zdWJzaWR5LWxpc3Qv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Many Dutch hydrogen projects on European subsidy list.

The European Commission is making €5.2 billion available to projects of common European interest in the hydrogen value chain. The list of projects also includes a number of Dutch projects.

For example, Air Liquide wants to build a 200 MW electrolyzer in Terneuzen. The project, called ELYgator, cleverly integrates two different electrolysis technologies – PEM and Alkaline – into one design. PEM uses membrane technology and can respond quickly to fluctuations in the supplied energy flow.

While Alkaline is more economical and has a longer lifespan. Thanks to this combination, the electrolyzer not only efficiently supplies hydrogen and oxygen, but also supports grid stability.

The CurtHyl project by Air Luide is also on the list. This Rotterdam project initially involves a 10 MW electrolyzer for converting electricity from the Slufterdam wind farm into green hydrogen. In a next phase, the installation may be expanded to 100 MW with electricity from the Hollandse Kust Zuid wind farm.

Engie and HyCC

On the list of hydrogen projects that receive a subsidy is also Engie. This company is working together with OCI and EEW on a 100 MW electrolyzer in Eemshaven, which will use energy from offshore wind turbines.

From 2025, the electrolyzer must produce green hydrogen for the production of e-methanol (OCI, Delfzijl) from biogenic CO2 (EEW, Farmsum). The project has been given the name HyNetherlands (HyNL). There are already plans to scale up the production capacity of the electrolyzer from 100 MW in 2025 to 1.85 GW in 2030 or shortly thereafter.

In addition to this project, OCI is also involved in the Djewels project of Gasunie and HyCC. At Djewels, it concerns a 20 megawatt electrolyzer at Chemiepark Delfzijl that will deliver the first green hydrogen to OCI in 2024.

Djewels is a stepping stone to two much larger projects of HyCC, which are on the European subsidy list, namely H2ermes and H2Fifty. These projects involve a 100 MW electrolyzer in IJmuiden and a 250 MW electrolyzer in Rotterdam. These will produce green hydrogen for Tata Steel and bp’s refinery respectively.

Ørsted, Shell and Uniper

Further on the list of projects that receive funding: Ørsted, Shell and Uniper. Ørsted is working with Yara in Sluiskil on a 100 MW electrolyzer. This installation is powered by offshore wind energy from Ørsted. Shell is already building hydrogen plant Holland Hydrogen I. The 200 MW electrolyzer on the Second Maasvlakte is expected to be operational in 2025.

The current for the electrolyzer comes from hollandse kust (noord). And Uniper is working on the production of green hydrogen at its Maasvlakte location. The plan is to realize a 100 MW electrolyzer, with a future expansion to 500 MW.

By participating in Nuit Blanche, providing free hydrogen shuttles, Air Liquide and Toyota are reiterating their commitment to participate in the development of clean mobility.

As pioneers of hydrogen mobility and long-standing partners, Air Liquide and Toyota will share their respective expertise for the 2022 edition of Nuit Blanche. Both Groups have joined forces to provide visitors with free new generation Toyota Mirai shuttles, powered by low-carbon hydrogen produced by Air Liquide. These vehicles will travel between three emblematic areas of the event: the Charléty stadium, the Hôtel de Ville, and the Villette, enabling their passengers to discover the artworks which will be installed there.

Through this initiative, Air Liquide and Toyota want to showcase hydrogen-powered mobility and demonstrate that solutions to address the climate emergency and ensure the success of the energy transition exist. Hydrogen vehicles are electrically powered vehicles with an integrated fuel cell that converts hydrogen into electricity. The result: zero CO2 emitted over the distance traveled, all the advantages of electric mobility combined with great autonomy and fast recharging.

Taking action today while preparing for the future is at the heart of Air Liquide’s strategy. As a pioneer and an expert in hydrogen, the Group is a world leader in the large-scale production of low-carbon hydrogen and in the development of its uses in industry and mobility.

Matthieu Giard, Vice-President and member of Air Liquide’s Executive Committee, supervising Hydrogen activity, says:

“By providing sustainable mobility for Nuit Blanche, a major event in the cultural life of Paris, Air Liquide is reiterating its ambition to provide society with tangible solutions that address both the climate emergency and mobility needs. Air Liquide has been a world leader in hydrogen for 60 years. Today, the Group is drawing on its expertise in this molecule to ensure that the energy transition and the decarbonization of the planet are a success. This innovative partnership proves that by combining the skills of public and private partners, sustainable mobility is now possible and accessible.”

Air Liquide's participation in Nuit Blanche is part of an innovative and educational approach for the general public to improve knowledge about hydrogen and its potential for the energy transition. As such, the Group will broadcast “Génération Hydrogène”, a special program that will provide information about this molecule and its uses, on airliquide.com on September 28th.

Toyota is also multiplying innovative initiatives to provide increasingly environmentally friendly mobility solutions to promote the advent of a “zero-emission” world. The Group is convinced of the potential of hydrogen in mobility for cars, but also for trains, buses and boats, and in general of its key role in the energy transition. Toyota is therefore fully committed to democratizing its use in our daily lives and confirming its relevance.

“Toyota champions a low-carbon, inclusive and responsible society. That is why we aim to achieve carbon neutrality in Europe by 2030. Providing access to the Toyota Mirai, a zero-emission hydrogen vehicle, is a wonderful example of our investment in a better world,”

explains Frank Marotte, President and Chief Executive Officer of Toyota France."
