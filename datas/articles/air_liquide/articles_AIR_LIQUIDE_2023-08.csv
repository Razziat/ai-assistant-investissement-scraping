Air Liquide and LOTTE Chemical are expanding their hydrogen business to further cooperate in the ammonia decomposition, liquified hydrogen, and hydrogen shipping markets in Yeosu, South Korea.

Under terms of a signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), the duo will explore clean ammonia imported from overseas to produce hydrogen for power generation and mobility.

Plans also include the expansion of the LOTTE-Air Liquide Ener’Hy joint venture, to include a focus on liquefied hydrogen as well as gaseous hydrogen.

LOTTE-Air Liquide Ener’Hy was established in December 2022. As a first project, the joint venture will develop a shipping centre using by-product hydrogen at a site within LOTTE Chemical’s Daesan plant. Start-up is scheduled for the second half of 2024."
Is L'Air Liquide S.A. (EPA:AI) Worth €162 Based On Its Intrinsic Value? - Simply Wall St,"Sat, 12 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3NpbXBseXdhbGwuc3Qvc3RvY2tzL2ZyL21hdGVyaWFscy9lcGEtYWkvbGFpci1saXF1aWRlLXNoYXJlcy9uZXdzL2lzLWxhaXItbGlxdWlkZS1zYS1lcGFhaS13b3J0aC0xNjItYmFzZWQtb24taXRzLWludHJpbnNpYy12YdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Key Insights

L'Air Liquide's estimated fair value is €133 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity

Current share price of €162 suggests L'Air Liquide is potentially 21% overvalued

which is 32% above our fair value estimate

How far off is L'Air Liquide S.A. ( ) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!

Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.

What's The Estimated Valuation?

We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.

A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:

10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate

2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF (€, Millions) €2.66b €2.93b €3.47b €3.77b €3.99b €4.16b €4.29b €4.39b €4.48b €4.55b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x10 Analyst x9 Analyst x2 Analyst x2 Est @ 5.70% Est @ 4.21% Est @ 3.17% Est @ 2.44% Est @ 1.93% Est @ 1.57% Present Value (€, Millions) Discounted @ 6.5% €2.5k €2.6k €2.9k €2.9k €2.9k €2.8k €2.8k €2.7k €2.5k €2.4k

(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)

Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = €27b

The second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 0.7%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.5%.

Terminal Value (TV)= FCF 2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = €4.5b× (1 + 0.7%) ÷ (6.5%– 0.7%) = €80b

Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= €80b÷ ( 1 + 6.5%)10= €42b

The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is €69b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of €162, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.

Important Assumptions

The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at L'Air Liquide as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.001. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.

SWOT Analysis for L'Air Liquide

Strength Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry. Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows. Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows. Weakness Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Chemicals market. Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value. Opportunity Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years. Threat Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the French market.

Looking Ahead:

Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value lower than the current share price?

Supporting the expansion of biomethane around the world to sustain energy transition - Air Liquide,"Fri, 04 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvYmlvbWV0aGFuZS9zdXBwb3J0aW5nLWV4cGFuc2lvbi1iaW9tZXRoYW5lLWFyb3VuZC13b3JsZC1zdXN0YWluLWVuZXJneS10cmFuc2l0aW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When it comes to the renewable energy sources that are making headlines these days, biomethane is a rising star that has the potential to play an important role in the decarbonization of both heavy-duty transport and industry. For over a decade, Air Liquide has been facilitating the expansion of this key energy source around the world.

Biomethane’s life cycle starts with a variety of common waste products that result from daily life: food scraps, manure and other organic compounds. But how does decomposing waste become one of the most sustainable alternatives to fossil natural gas and diesel? Explanations.

To start, biomethane facilities receive deliveries of the aforementioned organic waste. After being homogenized and pasteurized, the resulting sludge is fed into an anaerobic digester. This closed tank provides the oxygen-free environment necessary for bacteria to digest and breakdown organic matter. The biogas that results from this decomposition process is a mixture of carbon dioxide and biomethane, which must then be separated from one another. By passing the biogas through Air Liquide’s proprietary polymer membranes, the biogas is purified and the carbon dioxide removed. This technology has been fine-tuned by Air Liquide to be as sustainable as possible, maintaining a high extraction rate (up to 99%) while optimizing electricity consumption. The final result? High-quality biomethane which can be fed into the natural gas grid or liquified to be used as transport fuel and in industrial processes.

Air Liquide’s commitment to a closed-loop biomethane production process creates high levels of efficiency and sustainability for all stakeholders. The production of biomethane and its uses actively encourage the development of a circular economy by giving farmers, manufacturers and local authorities a sustainable and financially interesting alternative to discarding their waste. To complete the cycle, waste left over after the treatment process returns to farms as fertilizer.

An expanding global network

Within the biomethane production industry, Air Liquide is a major global player possessing proprietary biomethane purification and liquefaction technologies. The Group’s extensive expertise enables it to handle every aspect of the production process, from sourcing the raw materials to transforming biogas into biomethane, as well as handling transport and delivery to customers. This 360-degree involvement makes Air Liquide an ideal partner for those looking to source biomethane for their operations, and Air Liquide is ready to meet growing demand around the world.

In recent years, Air Liquide has expanded its initial production base from France, Norway and the United Kingdom to several other countries where there is a growing demand for this low-carbon alternative to natural gas."
"IRA at 1: Hydrogen developers hold off construction, ramp up lobbying - S&P Global","Mon, 14 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zcGdsb2JhbC5jb20vbWFya2V0aW50ZWxsaWdlbmNlL2VuL25ld3MtaW5zaWdodHMvbGF0ZXN0LW5ld3MtaGVhZGxpbmVzL2lyYS1hdC0xLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLWRldmVsb3BlcnMtaG9sZC1vZmYtY29uc3RydWN0aW9uLXJhbXAtdXAtbG9iYnlpbmctNzY4MTA3NTjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Construction workers lift a wind turbine blade with a crane at the Lone Star Wind Farm near Abilene, Texas. The Biden administration is considering requiring subsidized hydrogen plants to procure new zero-carbon electricity from sources such as wind and solar.

Source: Robert Nickelsberg / Contributor via Getty Images





Twelve months ago, clean hydrogen developers were celebrating historic federal investments in the nascent industry, expected to give the zero-emission gas the ability to compete with fossil fuels in the US. But on July 11, a lobbying group for the sector ran a full-page advertisement in The New York Times depicting a production plant posted with the sign ""FACTORY CLOSURE.""

The US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), enacted in August 2022, authorized a tax credit for hydrogen producers worth up to $3 per kilogram, depending on the overall carbon footprint of the product. The program, called 45V, was designed to lower the cost of ""clean"" hydrogen by spurring investment in new production methods that use electricity or carbon capture technology to abate emissions.

But of the 115 hydrogen projects announced in the US since President Joe Biden's inauguration, only 11 have secured capital commitments, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights' hydrogen production assets database. The industry's dormancy can be traced to an in-the-weeds policy debate over how the US Treasury Department should measure hydrogen's emissions. Now, one side has launched a mass marketing campaign.

""America cannot reach our goals without clean, domestic hydrogen,"" said the advertisement, paid for by the Fuel Cell & Hydrogen Energy Association. ""Additionality would undercut it all.""

The ad refers to the ""additionality rule,"" a proposal that would require hydrogen producers to procure new clean power capacity before claiming that their electricity is zero-carbon. Without the rule, some plants could gain eligibility for tax credits by purchasing renewable energy certificates.

Groups such as the Natural Resources Defense Council said the Treasury Department must adopt the additionality rule, along with two other proposals collectively referred to as the three pillars, to prevent a sudden build-out in hydrogen plants from overloading the power grid.

The other pillars are a time-matching requirement, designed to match hydrogen production with peak renewable generation, and a ""deliverability"" rule requiring that clean generation be in the same geography as the plant.

Studies from Princeton, Rhodium Group and the American Council on Renewable Energy draw various conclusions on how the three pillars would affect hydrogen emissions. But they all agreed that, without additionality requirements, the tax credit program would only increase US carbon dioxide emissions.

Hydrogen producers lobby up

But industry groups said the rules will slow deployment of the extensive hydrogen infrastructure necessary to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors such as steelmaking and aviation.

The IRA sets a high bar for the full $3-per-kilogram credit, requiring producers to limit their carbon footprint to the equivalent of 5% that of conventional hydrogen production from fossil fuels. Failure to meet that top-tier emissions standard immediately bumps down the value of the tax credit to $1.

""One thing that I think the IRA did is that it moved the spotlight to the US, in terms of investment opportunity here,"" Adam Peters, CEO of L'Air Liquide SA North America, said in an interview after a presentation to congressional staffers on July 11. The meeting was the Fuel Cell & Hydrogen Energy Association's annual briefing on Capitol Hill. ""So if it becomes too restrictive, does it start shifting the spotlight back?"" Peters continued. ""I think it's a question that's out there.""

Peters reported Air Liquide has invested $1 billion in the US hydrogen economy and $5 billion globally. The industrial gas producer plans to invest another $10 billion in the sector by 2035. What the company is waiting for is, ""basically, these regulations to come out, to see to what extent we can deploy that capital here in the US,"" Peters said.

Air Liquide is not the only international hydrogen company to consider spending its money elsewhere, depending on the Treasury Department's determination.

Speaking after the same meeting that Peters attended, Plug Power Inc. President and CEO Andy Marsh said the company hired consultants to model the impact of stringent eligibility requirements for the US incentive. The conclusion was that the so-called three pillars ""could be really damaging to the development of green hydrogen in the United States, to where we thought, quite honestly, we had a greater opportunity in Europe,"" Marsh said.

The green hydrogen and electrolyzer producer announced plans in May to invest $6 billion in three hydrogen plants in Finland.

Referring to a shift in capital to Europe, ""I wouldn't count that out,"" Alex Nevokshonoff, a senior associate with Enverus Intelligence Research, said in an interview.

The European Commission recently set its own standards for clean hydrogen production that would add new requirements in phases, including a rule that would require hourly time-matching between electrolyzer run times and renewable electricity generation starting in 2027.

Nevokshonoff cited the time-matching rule as a potential area for the US to adopt stricter rules out of the gate, but added that this was unlikely based on past US policy. ""They want to build out this hydrogen industry,"" Nevokshonoff said.

If the US does adopt a strict time-matching rule, ""you probably will see some investors move over to Europe. But I wouldn't think it would be a complete mass exodus from US investment because that $3 per kilogram is extremely attractive,"" Nevokshonoff continued. ""Even with hourly matching, there's still ways to make very economical projects.""

Not all hydrogen companies are opposed to high US emissions standards. Electrolyzer manufacturer Electric Hydrogen Co. is one such three pillars advocate, arguing that lax standards would defeat the purpose of clean hydrogen as a fossil fuel alternative.

""The reason that we have a level of confidence around the industry's ability to meet those requirements is looking at some of the historical precedents out there,"" Paul Wilkins, VP of policy and government engagement, said at a July 31 panel in Washington, DC, on hydrogen policy.

Wilkins noted the industry reaction to Europe's standards, proposed in February. ""The number of announced projects go up by 10%, which I'll caveat is just announced projects,"" Wilkins said. ""But the number of projects in advanced planning or some level of interim planning actually went up by 30%.""

Congress gave the Treasury Department until Aug. 16, the one-year anniversary of the IRA's passage, to release draft guidance on the 45V hydrogen production tax credit program. However, the department has already missed deadlines for guidance on the spending package's other subsidies, and some industry members are not expecting the 45V tax credit rules to come out until fall 2023.

( SK Innovation Co.)

More energy companies, including South Korea's Hanwha Corp. and the Netherlands-based Shell Gas & Power Developments B.V., have joined the consortium for a major carbon capture and storage project in Malaysia, SK Innovation Co. said Friday.

The state-run Korea National Oil Corp. and Air Liquide Korea, an affiliate of French industrial gas provider Air Liquide S.A., are also among those joining the Shepherd CCS project in the Southeast Asian country, SK Innovation said.

The Shepherd project was launched in August last year, with the initial agreement involving a group of South Korean companies -- SK Energy Co., SK Earthon Co., Samsung Engineering Co., Samsung Heavy Industries Co. and Lotte Chemical Corp. -- and Malaysia's state-run oil company National Petroleum Ltd., better known as Petronas.

The project aims to capture carbon dioxide emitted from industrial sites in Korea and collect it in local carbon capture plants before transporting it to Malaysia for the onshore storage or offshore sequestration.

The memorandum of understanding has been renewed in accordance with the joining of the new participants, SK Innovation said.

SK Innovation, the parent of SK Energy and SK Earthon, said earlier the Shepherd plan will be a major project in Asia that covers the whole cycle of the CCS value chain.

The participating companies have tentatively picked the locations for the local capture plants in South Korea and the storage site in Malaysia.

With the feasibility study under way, the participants plan to look for additional sites for the capture plants and storage units to speed up the process, SK Innovation said. (Yonhap)"

AirGas supports welding programs all over the country.

Monday, Aug. 28, Jared Flynn, Sales Representative from Fairfield, AirGas Store presented The New London High School Welding Program with much needed consumables and equipment.

The Regional Manager has planned to attend but was called away at the last minutes Airgas, an Air Liquide Company, selected New London High School to receive these supplies as part of the Airgas High School Welding Education Initiative.

The Airgas Initiative provides material donations and educational support to schools such as NLHS. These efforts to support underserved high school welding programs across the nation.

Matthew May, New London’s Industrial Technology Teacher, students from the Welding and Building Trades classes, and Scott Kracht, Principal were on hand to welcome Mr.an Flynn.

Mr. May noted that there are many grant opportunities for the welding stations and large equipment, but the AirGas donation is extremely important.

Their $3000 donation of items needed to run a shop such as welding gases. rods and many smaller items are critical. Students must have these items to learn and practice the workday skills needed to become a professional welder.

The term “consumable” seems innocuous, but a high school program’s budget can be stretched thin by these daily costs. AirGas plays a vital role by providing these items.

Keeping up with job opportunities for young people is an important part of Mr. May’s work.

He noted that thousands of welding positions (315,250 to be exact) are expected to open in the next few years.

Since 2018, Airgas has assisted 72 schools, 4,200 welding students and nearly 450 instructors across the country.

In the past two years combined, more than 250 students obtained welding jobs directly after graduating from a school program supported by Airgas donations.

New London is planning to create an interest in welding careers among its students and to prepare them for entrance into a much-needed profession.

Airgas is a leading U.S. supplier of industrial, medical and specialty gases, as well as hardgoods and related products. AirGas has two distributors in Southeast Iowa, Fairfield (industrial) and West Burlington (medical).

Mr. May has worked with the Fairfield office and Mr. Flynn for a number of years.

Although Mr. May has lived in New London since 2016, he joined NLHS in 2022 as an instructor.

He taught at Keokuk HS. A grant he wrote while at Keokuk was awarded equipment and consumables in 2022.

Upon arriving in New London, Mr. May, with the encouragement of Mr. Flynn, wrote another AirGas request for help.

Now in the academic year 2023 he will experience firsthand the benefits of this outstanding national program.

In 2023 AirGas High School Welding Education Initiative awarded 55 schools to be part of the program.

Fourteen returning schools and 41 new schools from 22 states are participating. New London is the only Iowa school to be selected for the AirGas Program in 2023.

There are four key factors guiding the selection of welding programs: high unmet need at the school, a productive welding program with the potential to graduate job-ready welders; passionate teachers; and enthusiastic local Airgas champions.

Once selected, underserved high school technology programs are supported by Airgas welding and safety specialists and associates who volunteer their time and expertise.

Students, Mr. Kracht, and Mr. May help unload the pickup that arrived at 9 a.m. at the Industrial Arts Building. Jared Flynn had loaded the back seat and the bed with the AirGas donated items.

It is exciting to see emphasis placed on the trades.

Mr. May is also a carpenter and adds his proficiency by introducing students to this trade as well as welding.

Many small communities are noticing how difficult it is to find help with their homes and businesses. There is a shortage in all the trades as the Baby Boomers retire.

The New London district is looking forward to helping its students find success in entering the workforce in their chosen occupation."

China: discovering the new state-of-the-art and more sustainable manufacturing site - Air Liquide,"Wed, 02 Aug 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvaW5kdXN0cnkvY2hpbmEtZGlzY292ZXJpbmctbmV3LXN0YXRlLWFydC1hbmQtbW9yZS1zdXN0YWluYWJsZS1tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nLXNpdGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide recently inaugurated its new state-of-the-art manufacturing center in Penglai, Yantai Shandong Province, in China. This is the new base for Air Liquide’s industrial units manufacturing capabilities in China, as well as for our subsidiary Cryolor, which will manufacture high performance liquid hydrogen equipment for the Asian mobility market.

The relocation of facilities from Hangzhou to Yantai was an opportunity for the Group’s Engineering & Construction teams to rethink how they wanted to shape Air Liquide manufacturing capabilities in the country, in light of the Group’s strategy and the challenges in terms of environment and industrial competitiveness.

The new manufacturing site includes a sustainable workshop, which notably produces state-of-the-art energy saving air separation units, as well as hydrogen production units. Strategically located on a coastal city with a strong industrial foundation, a solid supply chain and an extensive transportation network, this site will contribute to creating a solid base for the Group’s development not only in China, but also in Asia.

Alongside the Cryogenic Technologies Center in Vitry-sur-Seine, France, and the manufacturing center in Ras Al-Khaimah, United Arab Emirates, the Yantai manufacturing center enables the Group to offer a more diversified portfolio of solutions and services to support the Group’s growth. Thanks to these production capacities, new technologies can be developed faster and turned into concrete industrial projects, particularly those of greater scale and complexity."
