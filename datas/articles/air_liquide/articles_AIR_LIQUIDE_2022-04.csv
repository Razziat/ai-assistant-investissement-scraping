Air Liquide and EQIOM Project in Northern France Selected by the European Innovation Fund - Business Wire,"Fri, 01 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIyMDQwMTAwNTIwOS9lbi9BaXItTGlxdWlkZS1hbmQtRVFJT00tUHJvamVjdC1pbi1Ob3J0aGVybi1GcmFuY2UtU2VsZWN0ZWQtYnktdGhlLUV1cm9wZWFuLUlubm92YXRpb24tRnVuZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:

Air Liquide (Paris:AI) and EQIOM are joining forces in a project named “K6” with the aim to transform EQIOM’s Lumbres plant into one of the first carbon-neutral cement plants in Europe. Through the implementation of innovative technologies, the project aims to capture around 8 million tons of CO 2 over the first ten years of operation. The K6 project has been awarded funding by the European Commission through its 2021 Innovation Fund call as one of seven industrial-scale projects out of more than 300 grant applications.

As part of the K6 project, EQIOM will carry out a program of technological innovation and in-depth transformation of its existing cement production plant in Lumbres, France. The solution aims to implement a First-of-a-Kind oxyfuel-ready kiln, powered with a high level of alternative fuel. Air Liquide will support this initiative by supplying oxygen to EQIOM’s production process and by leveraging its proprietary technology CryocapTM Oxy to capture and liquefy the CO 2 emissions.

Once purified and liquefied, the CO 2 captured at the Lumbres Plant would be transported via shipping to permanent storage sites currently under development below the North Sea or would be utilized in building materials. The implementation of this project in close proximity to the port of Dunkirk would also contribute to the development of a new carbon capture and storage (CCS) ecosystem in Europe. The K6 project is a key step for the development of the Dunkirk D’Artagnan PCI (Project of a Common Interest), which aims to create a multi-modal CO 2 export hub1 from Dunkirk industrial basin and its broader area.

The European Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest programs for promoting innovative low-carbon technologies. Receiving this funding of 150 million euros is an essential milestone towards the implementation of the project. The K6 project is subject to additional funding, regulatory approvals and internal feasibility assessments prior to commencement.

Pascal Vinet, Senior Vice President, a member of Air Liquide Executive Committee, supervising Europe Industries, said: “We are pleased that the K6 project has been selected for funding by the European Commission. Air Liquide’s proprietary CryocapTM technology is particularly adapted to decarbonate activities such as the cement industry as it allows the capture of a high level of CO 2 emissions on industrial plants. Not only could this project transform the Lumbres plant into one of the first carbon-neutral cement plants in Europe, but it could also contribute to the creation of a new carbon capture and storage ecosystem in the Dunkirk industrial area. In line with its sustainability objectives, which include reaching carbon neutrality by 2050, Air Liquide’s ambition is to contribute actively to the emergence of a low-carbon industry.”

Roberto Huet, EQIOM CEO, said: “Thanks to EU and French Government support, EQIOM is moving one step closer to achieving carbon neutrality. The K6 programme in Lumbres demonstrates our commitment to addressing the challenges of climate change and our contribution to the development of a more sustainable and resilient built environment. It will also contribute to the local economy and help to demonstrate France’s leadership in industrial innovation and emissions reduction.”

Fittingly for someone whose job is to keep things moving, Andrés Martínez has seen the world: a trained naval architect, he completed an MBA in Houston, returning to his native Spain to start his career in 1992.

Air Liquide wanted to shift the heavy vehicles used to transport its gases to clean fuel sources. Transmol played a key role in this in Spain, can you tell us more about it?

We’ve been driving Air Liquide pressurized gas in the industrial market for 10 years. In 2017, we decided to replace diesel trucks at the end of their service life with trucks running on natural gas for vehicles (NGV). Since then, the proportion of NGV trucks in our fleet that serves Air Liquide has risen consistently. 50 out of 55 units have now made the transition to NGV.

What were the challenges of changing to NGV, and how did Transmol and Air Liquide work together to surmount them?

Air Liquide contacted experts and invested in gathering valuable information before the switch to NGV. They ensured the change would be profitable for us and for them before committing, and they were able to prove it to us with efficiency and safety data. The research carried out allowed us to make the switch with confidence. We were already familiar with the gas itself, as we specialize in transporting large volumes of NGV, and we shared our relevant experiences with Air Liquide as well. We worked together to determine the best roll-out of NGV in our fleet.

How has Transmol benefited from this switch?"

MELBOURNE, Australia – Esso Australia has started early front-end engineering design (pre-FEED) studies into potential carbon capture and storage to cut emissions from local industries close to the Gippsland basin in southeast Australia.

The South East Australia carbon capture and storage (SEA CCS) hub would initially make use of existing infrastructure to store CO 2 in the depleted Bream field offshore Victoria.

Esso Australia is in talks with various parties interested in accessing the proposed hub to reduce emissions from their operations.

The goal is to capture up to 2 MM metric tons/yr of CO 2, with the facilities potentially operational by 2025.

Last month the company revealed that construction had started of a new Air Liquide facility designed to capture and reuse CO 2 extracted from Gippsland gas has commenced.

Esso Australia will capture and send excess CO 2 from the Longford gas conditioning plant to Air Liquide, which will process and provide the gas in various forms to Australian businesses. The company operates the Gippsland basin joint venture, in partnership with BHP Petroleum (Bass Strait).

Q1 2022: Strong sales growth and continued investment momentum - Air Liquide,"Wed, 27 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL2dyb3VwL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzLW5ld3MvMjAyMi0wNC0yNy9xMS0yMDIyLXN0cm9uZy1zYWxlcy1ncm93dGgtYW5kLWNvbnRpbnVlZC1pbnZlc3RtZW50LW1vbWVudHVt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Commenting on sales in the 1st quarter of 2022, Benoît Potier, Chairman and CEO of the Air Liquide Group, said:

“There was strong growth in this first quarter, which reflects a good level of activity and demonstrates the Group’s resilience in a context marked, notably, by inflation and the war in Ukraine. Group sales were up +8% on a comparable basis and +29% based on published figures, notably reflecting the sharp rise in energy prices contractually passed on to Large Industries customers. Sales reached 6.9 billion euros, including 6.6 billion for Gas & Services. This growth confirms the strength of the Gas & Services businesses and the strong momentum of the Engineering & Construction and Global Markets & Technologies business lines. Gas & Services, which represents over 95% of Group sales, was up +7.1% on a comparable basis. This reflects notably the strong growth of the Electronics business line as well as Industrial Merchant which demonstrated, once again, its ability to adapt prices to reflect rising costs. Despite a high basis of comparison, the Healthcare business line continued to grow. In terms of geographies, growth was particularly strong in Europe and the Americas. Regarding eﬃciencies, the Group continued to take action to improve performance. In the 1st quarter of 2022, 77 million euros in eﬃciencies were generated in spite of a highly inflationary context, and we confirm our target of over 400 million euros over the year. Cash flow remains high at more than 23% of sales excluding the energy effect. Investment decisions over the quarter reached the very high level of 913 million euros, with several Electronics projects, particularly in Asia. The 12-month portfolio of opportunities remains stable at 3.3 billion euros. The proportion of projects linked to the energy transition exceeds 40%. These investments will foster future growth. They will also contribute to ADVANCE, Air Liquide’s new strategic plan for 2025. This plan, which combines financial and extra-financial performance, is structured around four priorities: delivering strong financial performance, decarbonizing industry, promoting progress through technological innovation and acting for all. With ADVANCE, the Group reaffirms its commitment to sustainable development while continuing its growth trajectory. In 2022, assuming no significant economic disruption, Air Liquide is confident in its ability to further increase its operating margin and to deliver recurring net profit growth at constant exchange rates.[1]”

Increased presence in India with an investment of around 40 million euros in a new air separation unit dedicated to Industrial Merchant activities, in the state of Uttar Pradesh in northern India.

Group revenue totaled 6,887 million euros in the 1st quarter of 2022, up a strong +7.9% on a comparable basis. This performance was delivered in a challenging context of exceptionally high energy prices, strong inflation, strain on supply chains and the war in Ukraine. The Group benefited from a solid business model and proactive actions to increase prices in the Industrial Merchant business. Introduced in the 2nd half of 2021, the effectiveness of these increases started to be seen from the 4th quarter of 2021, with stronger pricing in the 1st quarter of 2022. The Group’s published revenue saw very strong growth of +29.1% with an energy impact that reached +16.4% and with favorable currency (+4.2%) and significant scope (+0.6%) impacts.

Gas & Services revenue totaled 6,590 million euros, up by + 7.1% on a comparable basis. Sales as published for the 1st quarter of 2022 showed a strong growth of +29.1%, with a very high energy impact at +17.2% and with positive currency (+4.2%) and significant scope (+0.6%) impacts.

Gas & Services revenue in the Americas region totaled 2,331 million euros in the 1st quarter of 2022, showing a strong increase of +9.0% on a comparable basis. Growth in Large Industries reached +8.3%, driven by the dynamic demand, particularly in the Chemicals and Steel industries. Up +10.0%, Industrial Merchant revenue benefited from the acceleration of pricing (+9.3%) and the increase in volumes. Proximity care in the United States and the Home Healthcare business in Latin America drove growth in the Healthcare business line (+3.5%) in a context of lower demand for medical oxygen to treat covid-19. Finally, all business segments within Electronics contributed to the particularly dynamic growth (+10.0%).

Revenue in Europe increased by +7.2% in the 1st quarter of 2022 on a comparable basis and totaled 2,718 million euros in a context of exceptionally high energy prices and the war in Ukraine. While Large Industries showed a -4.5% decrease in sales, growth accelerated in Industrial Merchant to reach an exceptionally high level of +22.7%, driven by record pricing of +19.4% . Healthcare continued to grow (+3.0%) despite a particularly high basis of comparison in 2021, benefiting from dynamic development in Home Healthcare.

Sales in Asia-Pacific were up +4.4% on a comparable basis in the 1st quarter of 2022 and totaled 1,340 million euros , driven by particularly dynamic growth across all the Electronics business segments (+13.1%). Large Industries sales were down slightly by -1.1%, impacted by soft demand in China and by low hydrogen sales in South Korea. Industrial Merchant revenue grew by +2.7%, benefiting in particular from solid growth in China.

Revenue in the Middle-East and Africa totaled 201 million euros, which was stable (-0.2%) on a comparable basis and compared to the 1st quarter of 2021. Volumes increased strongly in South Africa with the integration of the 16 Sasol air separation units whose acquisition was finalized at the end of the 1st half of 2021: sales of approximatively 35 million euros in the 1st quarter were recognized as part of the significant scope impact (and hence excluded from comparable growth).

Large Industries sales were stable (+0.1%) on a comparable basis compared to the 1st quarter of 2021, with mixed activity depending on the region. In the Americas, demand was robust across all markets, while in Europe and Asia, sales were lower in the Steel and Refining industries. Demand in the Chemicals industry remained solid globally. Industrial Merchant business posted strong comparable growth of +11.9%, driven by the acceleration of pricing which was up +10.7%, even reaching +19.4% in Europe, and by solid volumes. Sales comparable growth was particularly dynamic in Electronics, at +13.7%, with all business segments showing strong growth. Healthcare continued to grow (+2.6%) on a comparable basis, supported by the momentum of Home Healthcare activity, despite a particularly high basis of comparison in 2021 related to the strong demand for medical oxygen to treat Covid-19.

Consolidated revenue from Engineering & Construction totaled 108 million euros in the 1st quarter of 2022, posting a strong growth of +40.3% and reflecting the increase in order intake in recent quarters. Order intake reached 264 million euros.

The sales of Global Markets & Technologies totaled 189 million euros in the 1st quarter, up a strong +18.3%, driven by the dynamic biogas activity and the increase of sales for the hydrogen mobility. Order intake for Group projects and third-party customers reached 214 million euros, up compared to 2021.

Efficiencies[3] reached 77 million euros in the 1st quarter. This performance was delivered in a context of high inflation unfavorable to procurement efficiencies. The projects initiated at the beginning of 2022 are expected to increase their contribution over the coming quarters, hence confirming the annual objective set at more than 400 million euros. In this inflationary environment, the priority of operations was the passthrough of costs into pricing.

Cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital totaled 1,400 million euros, a strong increase of +12.6% and +8.7% excluding the currency impact. It stood at 23.3% of sales excluding the energy impact, stable compared to the 1st quarter of 2021. It allowed, in particular, the financing of industrial investments, which amounted to 784 million euros, representing 13.0% of sales excluding the energy impact.

In the 1st quarter of 2022, industrial and financial investment decisions reached the very high level of 913 million euros, compared to 603 million euros in the 1st quarter of 2021.They included several carrier gases supply projects in Asia but also in the United States and in Europe for Electronics customers. The 12-month portfolio of investment opportunities is stable at the high level of 3.3 billion euros at the end of March. Projects related to the energy transition account for more than 40% of the portfolio.

The additional contribution to revenue of unit start-ups and ramp-ups amounted to 105 million euros in the 1st quarter of 2022 and is expected to be between 410 and 435 million euros in 2022, higher than in 2021.

3 Neon Gas Stocks to Watch as Geopolitical Events Threaten Supply - Yahoo Finance,"Thu, 07 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy8zLW5lb24tZ2FzLXN0b2Nrcy13YXRjaC0xMDIzMTk5MjguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide ( AIQUY ): Global industrial gases giant just clinched new long-term contract deals.

Reports that about half of global supplies of neon gas used in computer chip manufacturing were shattered as Russia attacked Ukraine attracted investors’ attention to neon gas stocks. Investors would expect neon gas stocks to surge as supplies dry up at a time industrial demand from chipmakers is exploding.

Neon gas is a rare gas used in cryogenics, lighting, imaging, and electronic chip manufacturing. Ukraine is home to the leading producers and exporters of neon gas, namely Ingas LLC and Cryoin Engineering. The two neon supply giants halted production as Russian bombs fell on their respective cities of Odesa and Mariupol. The latter city is currently besieged by Russian forces.

Ingas and Cryoin reportedly supply 45% to 54% of the global neon gas requirements for chip manufacturing. The majority of Cryoin’s exports reportedly go to United States-based customers.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Most noteworthy, the United States could probably be importing as much as 90% of its neon imports from Ukraine. Diversifying these imports cost-effectively could prove a tough challenge in the short term. That said, neon gas is also a byproduct of steel production, and China has a vibrant steel-making industry right now. It’s possible that Chinese producers could step up neon production this year.

Investing in neon gas stocks isn’t as straightforward. There aren’t any pure-play neon gas producers listed on stock exchanges. As can be noted with Ukraine producers, both Ingar and Cryoin Engineering are privately held companies. Most competitors are non-listed entities too.

Story continues

To compound the complexity, listed producers of industrial gases generally do not publicly disclose the component of neon revenue in total annual sales. Perhaps this is because neon gas sales are a small fraction of total gas sales.

That said, it’s highly likely that neon supply disruptions from Ukraine and Russia could create a bigger market for the big guys as semiconductor manufacturers try to fill the gaps.

Here are three industrial gas producers that investors seeking to buy neon gas stocks should watch as geopolitical events threaten global supplies.

Neon Gas Stocks to Watch: Air Liquide (AIQUY)

Paris-based Air Liquide (OTCMKTS:AIQUY) is a leading industrial gas producer globally. The company generated about $23.3 billion in revenue over the past twelve months and earns a good 18% net profit margin. Air Liquide could enjoy strong revenue growth as neon, helium and other high-purity gas prices soar in 2022.

Air Liquide’s Gas & Services segment generated 95.4% of total group sales in 2021. The company sells neon gas, but there is no special mention of neon in its financial reports implying that the product could still be a small component of group sales.

Interestingly, Air Liquide announced in March a €300 million ($332 million) investment in Japan to build four gas plants that produce ultra-high purity industrial gases. The new projects will serve the needs of two major semiconductor market leaders under long-term contracts. The company has been supplying the same customers with industrial gases for more than two decades.

Although no special reference to neon was made in the announcement, the new plants will produce large quantities of “nitrogen and other high purity gases.” The first plant is expected to commence production at the end of this year.

Air Liquide is also investing $60 million in a long-term deal to supply a semiconductor manufacturing plant in Arizona with high-purity gases. Growth is inevitable, and investors could enjoy more capital gains on top of the 60% total gain potentially earned over the past three years.

Linde (LIN)

United Kingdom-based Linde (NYSE:LIN) is the largest supplier of industrial gases to the world. Linde reported $31 billion in revenue for 2021 and its 12.4% net profit margin is far higher than an industry average net margin of 9.4%. The company generated record cash flows last year.

Although Linde made no special disclosure of neon-specific sales figures in its 2021 Annual Report, it sells neon “in a variety of purities and concentrations” across the world.

Linde generates most of its sales and operating earnings from the Americas (about 40% of total revenue and 47% of operating earnings in 2021).

Investing in LIN stock could yield good returns as the company executes on a $10 billion share repurchase program announced in February. Linde has increased its dividend by an average of 10% over the past three years and management announced another 10% increase in quarterly dividends in February. The current $4.68 annualized dividend should yield 1.5% though, so capital gains will matter more during an investor’s holding period.

Speaking of gains, $10,000 invested in LIN stock just five years ago would have grown to over $29,000 today, with dividends reinvested.

Neon Gas Stocks to Watch: Air Products (APD)

Air Products (NYSE:APD) is another industrial gas production giant to watch as the neon gas supply market gets disrupted. The Allentown, PA-based U.S. company generated $10.3 billion in gas sales during the calendar year 2021 and boasts of an industry-leading net income margin above 20%.

In its marketing materials, Air Products says it “supplies neon gas and neon-fluorine excimer laser mixtures” and that its “high purity neon is ideal for excimer lasers and other laser applications for semiconductor manufacturing.”

That said, revenue from neon gas sales is presumably a small component of total annual sales, historically. Hydrogen is APD’s major industrial gas which is listed 13 times in Air Products’ 2021 Annual Report. Instead, the company bundles up neon gas in the term “cryogenics” or “specialty gases.”

Investing in neon gas stock Air Products today could lock in a 2.6% dividend yield. Wall Street analysts expect APD to grow its revenue by 15.3% year-over-year in 2021. Growth could be higher if the company wins more neon gas customer orders this year.

Improving patients' quality of life - Air Liquide,"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvaGVhbHRoY2FyZS9pbXByb3ZpbmctcGF0aWVudHMtcXVhbGl0eS1saWZl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Because every patient experiences their illness differently, Air Liquide favors personalized care plans. This is a virtuous approach that aims to improve both the patient’s health and quality of life at the best cost for the healthcare system. Working daily with all healthcare professionals, the Group contributes to the transformation of healthcare at home, in hospitals and in other care settings by offering innovative solutions that create value for all healthcare stakeholders.

You launched the transformation of Air Liquide’s Home Healthcare business by implementing a Value-Based Healthcare approach. Could you please explain what this means?

This approach focuses on patients beyond their illness. We put them, as people, at the heart of the healthcare system, taking into account everything that makes them unique. By this I mean their relationship with their illness, their history, their lifestyle and even their family situation. We are moving from a service-based approach to an approach that focuses on the key benefits for patients to improve their quality of life in a more cost-effective way. It is a unique opportunity to organize the entire healthcare ecosystem around a common goal. Leading stakeholders are already implementing it in several countries (hospitals, clinics, healthcare systems), and the results are promising. International organizations1 are taking part in this transformation and helping shape healthcare policies that promote the emergence of value-based initiatives.

In what way is this approach strategic for Air Liquide?

Around the world, healthcare systems are facing a two-fold challenge: ensuring their continuity and upholding quality of care. Value-Based Healthcare is now essential for Air Liquide, which is taking long-term action to meet this challenge. Today, Air Liquide takes care of 1.9 million patients with chronic diseases. Our combined human and digital approach allows us to offer them more personalized care plans. Our proximity to our patients and our role as a major player in home healthcare alongside healthcare professionals allow us to contribute to the transformation of healthcare.

What challenges do you face in the coming months?

Although several European countries have begun this patient-centered transformation process, the challenge now is ensuring this initiative is adopted in all regions. We must fundamentally rethink care pathways, with the goal of making them more personalized in order to improve patients’ health and quality of life. We need to prove the value we are generating with this approach, and this requires systematic measurement of the benefits to the patient. This is a complex but exciting task. It requires a coordinated approach from all healthcare professionals in order for the entire ecosystem to reap the benefits. This includes physicians, who can rely on our teams to ensure compliance with treatment, those responsible for covering the costs, who see the optimization of overall care costs, and hospitals, which can focus on critical procedures."

Dastur Successfully Completes Techno-Economic Feasibility of India's Largest Carbon Capture and Utilization Project ... - Business Wire,"Thu, 14 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi0AFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIyMDQxNDAwNTMzMy9lbi9EYXN0dXItU3VjY2Vzc2Z1bGx5LUNvbXBsZXRlcy1UZWNobm8tRWNvbm9taWMtRmVhc2liaWxpdHktb2YtSW5kaWElRTIlODAlOTlzLUxhcmdlc3QtQ2FyYm9uLUNhcHR1cmUtYW5kLVV0aWxpemF0aW9uLVByb2plY3QtYXQtdGhlLUlPQ0wtS295YWxpLVJlZmluZXJ50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dastur International, Inc. and Dastur Energy (Dastur) announced the successful completion of the Techno-Economic Feasibility of the Indian Oil Corporation Limited’s (IOCL) Carbon Capture and Utilization Project at the 13.7 mtpa Koyali refinery in Gujarat, India. The project was funded by a grant from the United States Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

The project, as designed, provides IOCL with a technically and economically viable solution for capturing up to almost 0.7 mtpa (million tonnes per annum) of carbon dioxide from its Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) based Hydrogen Generation Units (HGU) at a very competitive cost structure. The captured CO 2 will be primarily used at the Oil and Natural Gas Commission's (ONGC) Gandhar oilfields for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) from its maturing oil wells. A part of the captured CO 2 is also expected to be liquefied and purified to 99.9% for supply to food and beverage sector consumers.

The carbon capture solution designed by Dastur would allow IOCL to substantially decarbonize its HGU operations and support IOCL’s strategy of producing clean hydrogen. The project also supports the Government of India’s mandate of decarbonizing the oil & gas sector. With carbon accounting likely to become a reality in developing carbon markets, this carbon capture project can be expected to provide a competitive advantage to IOCL in the form of carbon credits in the international markets.

The carbon capture system designed by Dastur provides IOCL with an integrated solution across the carbon value chain, enabling industrial-scale carbon capture and disposition. The project brings together Austin, TX based Dastur Energy’s knowhow and capabilities in the areas of energy engineering, gas processing, carbon capture technologies, energy supply chains and economics; Houston, TX based Air Liquide’s carbon capture technology offerings; the University of Texas at Austin’s Bureau of Economic Geology’s (BEG) experience in research and development in EOR; and India based M. N. Dastur & Co. (P) Ltd.’s engineering and capital project delivery capabilities.

Shri S.S.V. Ramakumar, Director (R & D) and Board member of IOCL, said, “The project and Dastur’s work provide a blueprint for IOCL and ONGC to pursue the ambitious goal of combining industrial-scale carbon capture with CO 2 EOR in India. Dastur and its partners evaluated different CO 2 sources and carbon capture technologies from multiple vendors to engineer a techno-economically feasible solution that we can implement within the constraints and challenges of a large and complex operating refinery. The novel use of advanced gas processing to provide an extremely competitive cost of carbon capture bodes well for the future success of the project.”"
The future of combustion energy in glass melting - Manufactures Monthly,"Wed, 06 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbm1vbnRobHkuY29tLmF1L2Z1dHVyZS1jb21idXN0aW9uLWVuZXJneS1nbGFzcy1tZWx0aW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Oxy-flames obtained at four levels of hydrogen enrichment, from 100 per cent natural gas up to 100 per cent hydrogen, at 100kW.

Manufacturers’ Monthly talks to Air Liquide’s international oxygen combustion expert about how its heat recovery packaged solution decreases the environmental impact of glass melting – and the potential upside of hydrogen as an efficient route to decarbonisation for melting technologies of the future.

Australia consumes about 1.36 million tonnes of glass packaging per year: wine and beer bottles, glass jars and containers.

In Western Europe, the average person consumes 18 kilograms every year.

The manufacturing processes of products like glass contributes to more greenhouse gas emissions than the chemical and metal industries. Front of mind for forward-thinking companies is reducing this impact – and industry has started taking steps to revolutionise the future of glass melting.

Chikashi Kimura, NEAPac international expert (combustion) for Air Liquide, said industrial gases can reduce the carbon footprint of industrial processes, but there is no one future-proof solution.

“Several options might emerge, alone or combined, with the electrical melter: co-firing with Biogas or Hydrogen, heat recovery and ultimately Carbon Capture Use and Storage (CCUS),” he said. “All these energies can be combined with oxy-combustion technology for better effectiveness.”

Having been with Air Liquide for more than 15 years, Kimura noted customers are prioritising low carbon materials in order to be selected for major contracts.

Heat Oxy-Combustion

Air Liquide’s Heat Oxy-Combustion technology has become renowned in the glass industry, and its effectiveness has only improved since it was recognised with the innovation award at the 2015 Paris Climate Conference. Leveraging off the experience of a brain like Kimura, the company continues to make strides in the research space for glass melting.

“The main principle of heat oxy-combustion is to recover a substantial portion of the heat lost through flue gases by indirectly preheating fuel and oxygen,” he said. “That heat extracted from the combustion fumes is used to heat oxygen and fuel, thereby improving oxy-combustion performance by at last 10 per cent and even more with new upcoming developments. Compared to air combustion, this technology provides up to 50 per cent energy savings and up to 50 per cent CO 2 emission reduction (excluding emissions generated for oxygen production).”

To develop this patented technology, safe and reliable equipment with specific material is designed and fully integrated with glass-melting furnaces. The equipment is made of special materials suited for very hot reactants.

Melting-Heat oxy-combustion consists of:

Oxygen supply: Liquid Oxygen storage (LOx) or low pressure gaseous state (FLOXALTMFloxal Oxygen). This is a competitive on-site production offer which provides the required quantity of oxygen according to all your needs; and

Glass melting patented technologies

Heat exchangers

A unique and patented combination of HEAT RECUPERATOR and HEATERS:

the HEAT RECUPERATOR recovers heat from hot fumes to air; and

the HEATERS transfer heat from air to fuel and oxygen.

Patented burners

All burners are made of specific materials to comply with high temperature:

GLASS MELTING BURNER-FC-HEATOX is a patented non-water-cooled oxy-fuel burner for technical and containers glass-type applications; and

GLASS MELTING BURNER-SUN-HEATOX is a patented non-water-cooled oxy-fuel burner for large furnaces, such as those that use float glass-type production.

Real-world applications

In a project funded by the European Commission to help industry reduce its environmental footprint, Air Liquide’s Heat Oxy-Combustion is being used at a factory in Bulgaria for the Şişecam group. In just one example of the innovation’s real-world capability, a pilot-scale industrial furnace was set up for tableware glass that uses only hot oxygen and natural gas to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emission for standard industry furnaces.

The project focused on validating the technology on tableware glass ahead of its potential transfer to small and medium sized furnaces regardless of the sector.

Under the system, natural gas and oxygen consumption is reduced by preheating the reactants (natural gas and oxygen) up to 550°C with waste heat from furnaces. This system entailed installing a heat-ox burner that is dedicated to work with preheated reactants. The operation was then optimised, improving efficiency by 10 per cent compared to air furnaces. The technology was shown to reduce emissions of CO2 by 23 per cent and NOx by 90 per cent.

As project partner, Air Liquid conducted the detailed analysis necessary for the validation of the pilot furnace and its environmental results. The validation of the technology hopes to encourage glass producers to invest in it.

Hydrogen as a new source of energy

Kimura said because heat oxy-combustion is already established, it will become more prevalent in the next 10 to 15 years. After 2035, however, the expert sees hydrogen-combustion as an efficient technique, which is why Air Liquide continues to work with institutes around the world to develop more fundamental research to apply in the industrial field.

“Key studies we are conducting are showing a lot of potential options for the future,” he said. “There’s no single way in order to reach carbon-neutral. The best solutions to grow and better our customers will change from country-to-country, so we are researching the best options for particular environments.”

One such study, based on the LCA (life cycle analysis) approach, was recently conducted by Air Liquide to assess the overall impact of the different decarbonisation strategies for glass melting.

A typical medium-size regenerative furnace operating with air and natural gas was chosen as the baseline scenario. Several technical improvements were then considered, like the replacement of the air with pure oxygen, the switching from natural gas to hydrogen and the addition of up to 50 per cent electrical boosting. The implementation of a Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) unit was also considered to reduce the CO 2 released in the atmosphere.

“Several options were compared for hydrogen production: Steam Methane Reforming (SMR), with or without a CCS unit downstream, or water electrolysis,” Kimura said. “As revealed by the study, the carbon intensity of the electricity has a strong impact on the overall emissions level. A sensitivity analysis was conducted on this parameter to better represent the variety of cases, from geographical areas with a high carbon footprint in the electricity mix to much lower levels like decarbonised electricity obtained from offshore wind.”

The most effective solution to reduce the overall CO 2 emissions consists in installing a CCS unit directly at the exit of the glass furnace. This solution allows a reduction in both the CO 2 coming from the combustion flue gases and the CO 2 released by the degassing of the raw materials, leading to an overall 63 per cent reduction of CO 2 emissions compared to the baseline scenario. Combined with a HeatOx, this figure can be further increased up to 87 per cent.

Kimura noted CCS can not be implemented everywhere and requires important infrastructure with significant costs.

“When focusing on the CO 2 emissions due to the combustion part, different options without CCS were compared,” he said. “The first one consists in replacing 50 per cent of the input energy by decarbonised electricity (hybrid furnace). Considering the French CO 2 emissions factor for the electricity (52g CO 2 /kWh), 56 per cent of the CO 2 emissions due to glass melting can be avoided with this hybrid furnace. The decarbonisation of electricity leads to higher reductions, up to 62 per cent with offshore wind (15g CO 2 /kWh) and 64 per cent with the theoretical 0g CO 2 /kWh CO 2 emissions factor.”

According to Kimura, a higher reduction of the carbon footprint can be reached by replacing natural gas by decarbonised hydrogen with air combustion (up to 88 per cent CO 2 reduction with offshore wind electricity). This option can be further improved by the combination of reactants preheating with oxy-combustion, leading to up to 92 per cent CO 2 reduction.

“Finally, the best approach appears to be the H 2 -hybrid furnace,” he said. “This is obtained by combining 50 per cent electrical boosting with 50 per cent decarbonised H 2 with heat oxy-combustion. The approach leads to 94 per cent CO 2 reduction for the combustion part (assuming offshore wind electricity).”

Undoubtedly – as the world continues on the path to a low-carbon economy – demand for low-carbon glass will amplify with the development of new furnace generations and technologies. Air Liquide has already identified the hybrid melting tank (electrical melter + oxy-firing, possibly combined with HeatOx) as an efficient glass container production solution. Kimura concluded that technologies for a low carbon industry exist today and will continue to be competitive.

“The benefits in terms of CO 2 emissions reduction are highly dependent on several factors like the CO 2 emitted during electricity production and cullet ratio,” he said.

“Solutions needs to be assessed for each individual site and specificities. Heat oxy-combustion is particularly relevant when used with hydrogen but also for CCS purposes.”"
Next-level tech injects value into mining - Australian Mining,"Thu, 14 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5taW5pbmcuY29tLmF1L25leHQtbGV2ZWwtdGVjaC1pbmplY3RzLXZhbHVlLWludG8tbWluaW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide’s Delaware innovation campus, home of its gold leaching testing platform.

Air Liquide has developed a gas injection technology called Nexelia to improve sustainability and quality of processes such as gold leaching and lithium carbonate purification.

The industrial gas supplier has grown out of France since 1902 to operate in 78 countries, employing around 64,500 people and serving more than 3.8 million customers.

With more than a century of experience in gas production technologies and applications, Air Liquide has served the Australian mining industry with mineral processing solutions for flotation and pH control, oxidative roasting, gold leaching and in-situ uranium leaching, process water treatment and nitrogen inerting systems for longwall underground mines.

The latest of these solutions is called Nexelia and it was designed in response to customers’ problems with chemical costs and sustainable processes.

Air Liquide regional operation centre market manager Eiichi Mizutani explained the motive behind Nexelia.

“Key objectives pursued by gold mine operators are to maximise productivity and gold recovery from increasingly complex ores, while doing so in a competitive and sustainable manner,” he told Australian Mining.

“More than ever before, gold mine operators need reliable and cost-effective solutions to meet their performance goals while respecting their commitment to corporate social responsibility.”

Nexelia for gold leaching is an all-in-one gas solution that injects industrial-quality oxygen into the pre-oxidation and cyanide leaching circuit in the most resource efficient volumes.

But no two ore samples are equal, and Air Liquide works with its customers to understand their material and design a system that will maximise productivity and minimise resource intensity.

“It all starts with process expertise, interacting with our experts either on-site or in the lab,” Mizutani said.

“By sending mineral samples to one of Air Liquide’s labs, we would design the experiment plan with different set-ups.

“Then for every set-up we measure changes in oxygen uptake ratios, cyanide consumption and gold increase yields with our commercial-level testing.”

By reducing resource intensity and minimising chemical consumption, mining companies can improve their sustainability and costs.

But the benefits of Nexelia stretch even further, according to Mizutani.

“In the gold mining field, the technology provides not only savings of cyanide consumption and sustainability, but it will also help to maintain or improve the gold recovery rate by verifying the mineral and adopting the oxygen transfer system for the specific application,” he said.

In keeping with current demands for technology-driven solutions, Air Liquide has rolled out a monitoring solution for dissolved oxygen and pH levels.

The Air Liquide wireless monitoring system is designed primarily for gold and copper leaching monitoring, Mizutani said.

“Using this system, the key data is uploaded almost real-time to the cloud, so we can check it anywhere from the smartphone or laptop,” he explained.

“By monitoring key parameters like dissolved oxygen, it ensures efficient oxygen usage and high performance of the process in terms of gold recovery and chemical consumption.

“The benefits of such tools are operational traceability, early detection of abnormal situations, alarms, getting real data and less travel to remote locations.”

But Air Liquide wasn’t happy with just serving the gold and copper sector, adding Nexelia for lithium carbonate purification to the fray. Another all-in-one gas solution, this applies to lithium carbonates produced by acid or basic routes from either brines or mined rocks.

Mizutani explained how carbon dioxide was used in a three-step process.

“It dissolves lithium carbonate from slurry, then solid impurities are filtered out. Finally, when heated up, dissolved lithium carbonate precipitates and releases carbon dioxide,” he said.

“The solution then captures the released carbon dioxide in this third precipitation phase and re-uses it in the initial dissolution phase.”

The result is battery-grade lithium carbonate and reduces the amount of carbon dioxide required per kilogram by three times – from 0.6kg of carbon dioxide per kilogram of lithium carbonate to 0.2kg of carbon dioxide.

Mizutani is excited to watch the results in Australia’s growing lithium sector after the technology showed its worth in North America.

“That was proven in Canada, but one of the strengths of our company is that Air Liquide’s efforts around the world can be replicated everywhere,” he said. “We feel that it is our mission to continue to contribute to the mining industry while grasping technological trends around the world.”

Nevada Air Liquide Hydrogen Plant To Produce Fuel From Garbage Gas - H2 News - Hydrogen News - Green Hydrogen Report,"Mon, 11 Apr 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmh5ZHJvZ2VuZnVlbG5ld3MuY29tL2h5ZHJvZ2VuLXBsYW50LW5ldmFkYS1sYW5kZmlsbHMvODU1MjE3My_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The facility near Las Vegas will use methane from landfills to produce the zero-emission gas.

Air Liquide, the industrial giant gas giant from France, is opening a new hydrogen plant near Las Vegas later this month. It will be producing the H2 from methane from landfills.

The fuel does not produce greenhouse gas emissions and will power fuel cell cars and trucks.

The new $250 million hydrogen plant will have a capacity as high as 30 tons of liquid hydrogen per day. This will be enough to power about 40,000 fuel cell vehicles, according to Air Liquide US operations head Mike Graff in a recent interview cited in a Bloomberg report.

The company intends to ship all the fuel it initially produces to California to meet the demand there. Currently, there are only about 12,000 fuel cell vehicles registered in California. That said, Air Liquide expects that the demand for this greenhouse gas emission-free fuel will rapidly rise in that state, particularly in the long-haul trucking sector. State regulations are rapidly decarbonizing the vehicles on its roads as a part of its strategy to decarbonize its entire economy by 2045.

The hydrogen plant is expected to serve primarily fuel cell trucks refueling in California.

While passenger vehicles have been moving mainly in the direction of battery electrics, the expectation is that this will not be the case for much of the transportation industry. Battery packs large enough to power electric trucks across long distances would require a substantial amount of additional weight. Moreover, refueling fuel cells with H2 is a notably faster process than recharging batteries, which is a critical factor for the trucking industry.

“Five minutes later, you’ve taken on a full load of hydrogen and you’re back on the road again,” explained Graff in the report.

The new hydrogen plant facility will be using landfill gas in the form of methane as the raw material. This will not only provide a source of emission-free fuel for transport vehicles but will also help to prevent landfill methane from escaping into the atmosphere. Methane is a top greenhouse gas, so by reducing its emissions while creating an emission-free fuel helps to improve two different areas of potential air pollution.

The landfill methane will first be purified into renewable natural gas at the hydrogen plant facility. From there, steam reformation is used to extract the H2. Though this process does still release the greenhouse gas of carbon dioxide, according to Graff, those emissions will be offset by the benefits of diverting the methane from being emitted by the landfill."
