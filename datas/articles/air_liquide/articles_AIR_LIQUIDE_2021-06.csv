"Hydrogen, a new era for aviation - Air Liquide","Wed, 30 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvaW5kdXN0cnkvaHlkcm9nZW4tbmV3LWVyYS1hdmlhdGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aviation is responsible for 2% of CO2 emissions and is at the heart of ecological issues. For aircraft as well as for airports, hydrogen could help cut emissions by 50% by 2050. Present across the entire hydrogen value chain, Air Liquide is using its technical and industrial expertise in hydrogen to help decarbonize aviation from the ground to the air. Learn how.

Hydrogen can be used for many applications in and around the airport

Low-carbon hydrogen is produced in gaseous form, particularly by using renewable energies for water electrolysis, as is already the case at our Bécancour site in Quebec. The numerous pipelines deployed by Air Liquide will soon mean that it can be transported in large quantities to a liquefier located near each airport. Thanks to its expertise spanning more than 50 years in the aerospace industry and extreme cryogenics, Air Liquide can use its experience in liquid hydrogen to serve airport ecosystems. Once liquefied, it is transferred to storage containers. Trucks can then fill up their tanks and carry out logistics, such as refueling on the tarmac.

The airport ecosystem

Once available at the airport, liquefied hydrogen is used for many purposes, including ground logistics: baggage tractors, forklifts, pods, super tugs, shuttle buses, etc. For example, at Seoul-Incheon International Airport, Air Liquide provides recharging stations for airport vehicle fleets with filling times of under 5 minutes. The environmental impact of all these vehicles is considerably reduced by using hydrogen to power them. Finally, thanks to high-performance trucks capable of storing up to 300 liters of liquid hydrogen, refueling can be done directly on the tarmac in a few minutes. One of the Group's projects is the winner of the AMI ""H2 Hub Airport"" to develop an airport hydrogen industry.

Aboard the aircraft

Aboard the aircraft, hydrogen can be used to power all the flight and communication systems in the cockpit, while ensuring passenger comfort by powering lighting, heating and all on-board services, including catering and refrigeration. In the future, it could be used for propulsion – either by direct combustion or by powering a fuel cell. When used in fuel cells, hydrogen combines with oxygen from the air to produce electricity with only water as a byproduct. The first hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft has been announced by Airbus for 2035. To best prepare for its arrival and contribute to the emergence of an innovative and strategic French sector, Air Liquide has partnered with Airbus and the ADP Group in June 2021.







With an already well-established presence in many business areas, Air Liquide is ideally positioned to develop synergies between mobility applications. This is in large part thanks to infrastructure that serves the entire airport infrastructure: taxi stands, bus terminals and train stations for local or long-distance transportation. This complementarity of infrastructure uses is a major lever for making low-carbon hydrogen accessible."

Unprecedented cooperation with global oxygen suppliers paves way to increase access for low- and middle-income ... - Clinton Health Access Initiative,"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbGludG9uaGVhbHRoYWNjZXNzLm9yZy9uZXdzL3VucHJlY2VkZW50ZWQtY29vcGVyYXRpb24td2l0aC1nbG9iYWwtb3h5Z2VuLXN1cHBsaWVycy1wYXZlcy13YXktdG8taW5jcmVhc2UtYWNjZXNzLWZvci1sb3ctYW5kLW1pZGRsZS1pbmNvbWUtY291bnRyaWVzLXRvLWFkZHJlc3MtY292aWQtMTktY3Jpc2lzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Agreement brokered by Unitaid and CHAI under the COVID-19 Oxygen Emergency Taskforce sees two of the world’s largest medical oxygen suppliers each collaborate with these ACT-Accelerator partners on increased access in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)

Two memoranda of understanding, one with Air Liquide and another with Linde, pave the way for increased oxygen supply in the context of COVID-19

Latest estimates show that around 1 million COVID-19 patients in LMICs need 2.2 million cylinders of oxygen per day

Geneva, 15 June 2021 – Unitaid and the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) are pleased to announce agreements[1] with Air Liquide and Linde respectively, which provide a pathway to increase access to medical oxygen in low- and middle-income countries during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Medical oxygen shortages around the world have been a tragic feature of the pandemic, impacting the poorest countries disproportionately. These access difficulties were entrenched in many parts of the world before COVID-19, and have been exacerbated by the pandemic, putting strain on fragile health systems and resulting in preventable deaths. Latest estimates[2] suggest that around 1 million critically-ill COVID-19 patients in low- and middle-income countries need 2.2 million oxygen cylinders (15.1 million cubic metres) a day at the moment, with concerning surges reported in several countries in Africa, Latin America and South-East Asia.

The agreements come following intense engagement with the world’s major oxygen suppliers by the COVID-19 Oxygen Emergency Taskforce. This group of partners[3], led by Unitaid and Wellcome under the ACT-Accelerator Therapeutics pillar, has been working together over the past four months to address the global oxygen crisis, building on the strong track record of the agencies involved. This unprecedented collaboration with industry aims to overcome fundamental issues such as unstable funding commitments and insufficient infrastructure, which have limited the availability of medical oxygen.

Under the two memoranda of understanding signed with Air Liquide and Linde, each company has committed to work with ACT-A global health partners to facilitate equitable access to oxygen in a number of priority countries, to meet the emergency needs of the COVID-19 pandemic. The collaboration with each supplier also aims to build a framework for local contractual agreements – in line with standard public procurement practices – which could form the basis of longer-term purchasing deals by governments and global agencies that fund access to medical oxygen, to avoid a shortage of supply as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Carl Bildt, WHO Special Envoy for the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A) and former Prime Minister of Sweden said: “Without a much improved supply of oxygen we will see the global numbers of people dying from COVID rising even faster. That’s why an improved public-private partnership is so necessary, and the role of industry is absolutely essential. I know from experience that it is a powerful combination when governments, multilaterals, and the private sector work together to solve massive issues. These pioneering oxygen agreements are urgently needed to save lives.”

Dr Philippe Duneton, Executive Director of Unitaid, said: “We welcome the engagement from Air Liquide and Linde. This is the first time such an agreement has been made to help facilitate equitable access to oxygen, an essential, lifesaving medicine. We hope that other oxygen suppliers will now follow suit and come to the table. There is a real opportunity to change the course of history – both for the COVID-19 pandemic, and for other areas where medical oxygen is so vital but has been often lacking, including pneumonia control, treating women who develop complications in childbirth and trauma patients.”

Under this initiative, Unitaid and CHAI, together with the Oxygen Emergency Taskforce partners, will seek to mobilise resources to fund medical oxygen storage and infrastructure, pay for emergency supplies, and finance the transportation of equipment and other tools needed for safe, resilient medical oxygen systems. Market interventions including advance purchase commitments and guarantees could form part of this package of measures. An estimated $400 million is needed immediately to enable this vital work to take place.

The Taskforce is also working to address supply shortages for other vital commodities, including oxygen concentrators and pressure swing absorption (PSA) plants, and connect countries to sources of financing for oxygen requests, including the Global Fund’s C-19 RM mechanism and the World Bank’s COVID-19 emergency health response.

Zachary Katz, Vice President of Essential Medicines at CHAI, said: “These agreements pave the way for wider use of medical oxygen at a time when the world continues to suffer acute shortages. We applaud Air Liquide and Linde and look forward to working together to expand access to oxygen to those most in need.”

Jean-Marc de Royere, Senior Vice President and member of the Air Liquide Group Executive Committee in charge of social programs, said: “Striving to improve oxygen access in LMICs is an integral part of our sustainable development commitments announced in March 2021. Today’s announcement is also in line with Air Liquide teams’ mobilisation since the beginning of the pandemic in the countries where the Group operates. Leveraging on its technical expertise and know-how, the Group will work along with Unitaid and CHAI, contributing to solutions to increase oxygen access in LMICs countries where demand is high and operational conditions are challenging.”

Sanjiv Lamba, Chief Operating Officer at Linde, said: “The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of access to healthcare for all. Linde’s employees stepped up in these extraordinary times to produce and deliver medical oxygen, playing a critical role in supporting healthcare systems across the world. All these efforts will be in vain if we cannot work together to improve access to medical oxygen in low and moderate income countries, overcoming the many challenges. Linde is proud to partner with Unitaid and the Clinton Health Access Initiative and we look forward to working together to increase access to oxygen on a fair and equitable basis.”

EDITOR’S NOTES

Background

Even before COVID-19, pneumonia was the world’s biggest infectious killer of adults and children, claiming the lives of 2.5 million people in 2019.

Port of Los Angeles deploys H2 fuel cell trucks | electrive.com - www.electrive.com,"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsZWN0cml2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wNi8xNS9wb3J0LW9mLWxvcy1hbmdlbGVzLWRlcGxveXMtaDItZnVlbC1jZWxsLXRydWNrcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Port of Los Angeles is now deploying five new hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and the opening of two hydrogen fueling stations with partners that include Toyota, Kenworth Trucks and Shell.

The $82.5 million Shore-to-Store (S2S) project will trial the vehicles for the next 12 months as part of a large-scale, multiyear demonstration designed to advance the Port’s Clean Air Action Plan goals. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) is supporting the project with a matching grant of $41.1 million. Project partners are contributing the remaining $41.4 million in financial and in-kind support. More than a dozen public and private sector partners and involved in the year-long demonstration of the zero-emissions Class 8 trucks.

Following this deployment of the five heavy-duty FCEV, the project will be expanded to include five more hydrogen-fueled heavy-duty trucks, two battery-electric yard tractors, and two battery-electric forklifts. The zero-emission vehicles will carry out local pickup and delivery and drayage near the Port as well as short regional haul applications inland. The aim is for the partners to study the technical feasibility of hydrogen-fueled tractors and battery-electric cargo handling equipment under rigorous conditions – The Port of Los Angeles is North America’s leading seaport by container volume and cargo value, facilitating $259 billion in trade during 2020.

Toyota Motor North America has designed and built the powertrain’s fuel cell electric power supply system, while Kenworth Truck Co has designed and built the Class 8 trucks with Toyota’s fuel cell electric system. Refuelling infrastructure has been built by Shell Oil Products US which will operate the project’s two new high-capacity hydrogen fueling stations in Wilmington and Ontario. Air Liquide is also participating as a fuel supplier.

Responsible for operating the trucks are Toyota Logistics Services (TLS), UPS, and trucking companies Total Transportation Services Inc. (TTSI) and Southern Counties Express (SCE). The Port of Hueneme will partner on drayage runs and serve as the site for testing the zero-emissions yard tractors.

Another central aim of the project is to measure the reduction of nitrogen oxide, particulate matter, and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as other pollutants in the area throughout the project. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory will collect and analyze project data, while the Coalition for a Safe Environment is responsible for representing the communities living close to the ports and related trucking and warehouse operations, many of which are low-income areas disproportionately impacted by air pollution from vessels, rail, trucking and off-road cargo handling equipment. The South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD), will serve as a project advisor.

The Port of Los Angeles Executive Director Gene Seroka said: “Transporting goods between our Port and the Inland Empire is the first leg of this next journey toward a zero-emissions future.” Bob Carter, Executive Vice President, Sales, Toyota Motor North America extrapolated: “By utilizing this technology, port operators like our own Toyota Logistics Services (TLS) can utilize a zero-emissions and scalable solution for CO2 reductions.”

With a number of zero-emission commercial vehicle government policies and projects having been introduced just over the last 12 months, the busy port is the centre of a flurry of decarbonisation projects. To give an idea of the velocity at which this area and its heavy-duty transport sectors are decarbonising, the following projects were all announced just last month in May: Nikola Motors announced it would be trialling battery-electric and fuel cell trucks at ports in LA and Long Beach with a pilot project. Towards the centre of the state in the San Joaquin Valley, WattEV is to build a pilot electric truck stop positioned near logistics fulfilment centres run by Amazon and Walmart that will feature a solar micro-grid with battery storage, plus grid energy from PG&E. On the hydrogen front, Hyzon Motors announced plans to enter into a joint venture with Raven SR to build waste-to-hydrogen hubs, starting with two in California. Volkswagen’s Electrify America is also contributing to zero-emission heavy-duty vehicle infrastructure and specifically in the Port area. As part of its payment obligations resulting from the Diesel Scandal, the Volkswagen subsidiary Electrify America will focus resources on regional shipping and help encourage the electrification of equipment and vehicles.

While this is all happening at an extraordinary speed, the task of decarbonising the Port is also enormous: The Port of Los Angeles is the nation’s busiest port complex and served by a fleet of more than 18,000 drayage trucks. Covid-19 did not slow down activity at the port, in fact, the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are claiming cargo records for the last seven months, with shipping volumes up 46 and 43 per cent, respectively, year-over-year. The Port of Los Angeles noted that the San Pedro Bay port complex operations and commerce facilitate one in nine jobs across the counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura.

To be located in Terneuzen, this electrolyzer is meant to produce large quantities of renewable hydrogen, contributing to the decarbonization of the Dutch and neighbouring countries’ industry and mobility markets. ELYgator is a new step in Air Liquide’s roadmap towards carbon neutrality in 2050 and the overarching target of 3GW of electrolyser capacity by 2030.

Implemented in the industrial basin of Terneuzen, in the Netherlands, this project would be connected to Air Liquide’s cross-border pipeline networks. This would allow for an optimized combination of flexibility and efficiency, best leveraging the output of renewable power production and taking into account its intermittency and seasonality specifics.

The renewable hydrogen produced would be certified and compliant with RED II (Renewable Energy Directive II). The ELYgator project would enable the avoidance of about 4 million tonnes of CO2 over the first ten years of the plant’s operation, which is equivalent to the emissions of 4,400 million kilometers driven by truck.

Pioneering projects such as ELYgator are needed to achieve national and European climate ambitions, as it can play an important role in decarbonization, particularly for hard-to-abate sectors like industry and heavy mobility. To compete with current fossil-based production, governmental support and regulatory incentives such as an effective RED II implementation in both the Netherlands and Belgium will be crucial. Air Liquide will submit its final ELYgator application to the last round of the European Innovation Fund selection on June 23rd.

Frédéric Despréaux, Vice President Cluster Northern Europe and CIS Countries at Air Liquide, said:

A concretization of the ELYgator project would contribute to the Dutch-Flemish cluster’s ambitions towards carbon neutrality in 2050, whilst using renewable electricity to its full potential with an efficient integration of hydrogen electrolysers in the entire value chain. It is also in line with Air Liquide’s ambitious Climate Objectives, of which hydrogen will be a major driver.

Air Liquide will invest around 60 million euros in the construction of a state-of-the-art Air Separation Unit (ASU) on the site, one of the largest oxygen sites in continental Europe, where it already owns three other ASUs. Thanks to enhanced energy efficiency, this new unit will improve the overall environmental footprint.

Air Liquide will design and build a new state-of-the-art ASU on the Severstal CherMK site in Cherepovets, one of the most competitive steel making sites worldwide. The new unit will produce 1,000 tons of oxygen per day. This is the fourth ASU installed by Air Liquide in Cherepovets.

Planned to be started up by the end of 2023, the unit will be owned and operated by Air Liquide Severstal, a joint venture established in 2005 between Air Liquide (75%) and Severstal (25%). It will bring the total production capacity on this site, one of the largest sites for Oxygen production in continental Europe, at above 8,000 tonnes of oxygen per day.

This new ASU is characterized by improved energy efficiency. In the framework of the agreement the two companies have also committed to further reduce the CO2 emissions arising from the oxygen production, in line with Air Liquide’s commitments to address the urgency of climate change and to act for a sustainable future.

Francois Jackow, Executive Vice President and a member of the Air Liquide Group’s Executive Committee supervising Europe Industries activities, said:

“This new contract will further strengthen our long-term partnership with Severstal, which we have been regularly building since 2005. Through our know-how and innovative solutions, we will keep working with Severstal to lower the environmental footprint of this major industrial site of Cherepovets. As part of its objective to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, Air Liquide is committed to address the urgency of climate change and to act for a sustainable future”.

Sarawak set for first methanol plant in 2023 - News - The Chemical Engineer,"Tue, 08 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNoZW1pY2FsZW5naW5lZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvc2FyYXdhay1zZXQtZm9yLWZpcnN0LW1ldGhhbm9sLXBsYW50LWluLTIwMjMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MALAYSIA’s state of Sarawak is pressing ahead with the construction of its first methanol plant, as it seeks to diversify downstream.

Sarawak Petchem was established by the state government of Sarawak in 2017 to develop and operate the first methanol plant in the state, which is already home to oil and gas industries. The 1.7m t/y facility will be built in Bintulu and is planned to begin operations in 2023.

The plant has been designed in partnership with Air Liquide Engineering & Construction and Samsung Engineering. It will produce methanol from natural gas provided by Malaysia’s national oil company Petronas. Air Liquide will license the process – Lurgi MegaMethanol – to convert the natural gas into methanol. The company will also provide an air separation unit with capacity to produce 2,200 t/d of oxygen.

When ground was broken for the project in 2019, Sarawak Petchem Chair Amar Abdul Aziz Husain, said the plant would complement the state government’s aspiration to turn Bintulu into a downstream petrochemicals hub, and a catalyst for future growth of downstream derivatives."
Hydrogen buses launched in London - The Engineer,"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWVuZ2luZWVyLmNvLnVrL2NvbnRlbnQvbmV3cy9oeWRyb2dlbi1idXNlcy1sYXVuY2hlZC1pbi1sb25kb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has launched England’s first hydrogen buses in the capital, with an aim to make all London buses zero emission by 2030.

The 20 buses will join over 500 electric buses in the core fleet which are already emission-free, aiming to improve the city’s air quality by reducing pollution and forming part of the UK’s wider net zero ambitions.

Manufactured by Wrightbus in Northern Ireland, with gas cylinders manufactured by Nottingham-based Luxfer, the hydrogen fuel cell powered buses will offer ‘smoother, quieter’ journeys for passengers in addition to being entirely free from harmful emissions, the only by-product being water from the chemical reaction of hydrogen with oxygen from the air.

Supported by over £12m funding from TfL, the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (FCH JU), the Innovation and Networks Executive Agency (INEA) and the Office of Zero Emission Vehicles, the buses form part of the FCH JU-funded Joint Initiative for Hydrogen Vehicles (JIVE) project which seeks to deploy 139 new zero-emission fuel cell buses and associated refuelling infrastructure across five European countries.

Wrightbus jobs boost will build better hydrogen buses

Growing a green gas giant: innovations in hydrogen production

The buses use hydrogen produced at Air Liquide’s plant in Runcorn, which harnesses waste hydrogen as a by-product from an industrial chlor-alkali plant. Oxford-based Ryze Hydrogen will transport the fuel to the fuelling station. From 2023, the hydrogen will be produced by electrolysis via a connection to an offshore wind farm.

A new fuelling station completed by Danish engineering firm Nel Hydrogen will top up each hydrogen fuel cell bus once per day in around five minutes.

Commenting on the launch, Khan said: “Our investment in these hydrogen buses is not only helping us to clean up London's air, but is supporting jobs and local economics across the UK. This is a great demonstration of how tackling air pollution and the climate crisis and boosting economic growth is about regions working together, investing in the very latest technology.”"

Twenty fuel cell vehicles by Northern Ireland’s Wrightbus will serve the number 7 route between East Acton and Oxford Circus.

Transport for London (TfL) already has more than 500 electric buses in its fleet as it aims to be zero-emission by 2030. Upon launching the new fuel cell buses today, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: “Our investment in these hydrogen buses is not only helping us to clean up London’s air but is supporting jobs and local economies across the UK.”

The buses were manufactured by Wrightbus in Northern Ireland, and the gas cylinders are manufactured by Luxfer in Nottingham. The hydrogen for the buses is produced at Air Liquide’s plant in Runcorn, harnessing waste hydrogen as a by-product from an industrial chlor-alkali plant. Oxford-based Ryze Hydrogen is responsible for transporting the fuel to the fuelling station. From 2023, the Mayoral Office further expects hydrogen to be even greener as it will be produced by electrolysis powered by a direct connection to an offshore windfarm.

At the moment, a fuelling station completed by Danish engineering firm Nel Hydrogen will top up each hydrogen fuel cell bus just once per day in as little as five minutes.

Funding came through TfL at about 6 million pounds; more than £5 million of funding has been provided by European bodies such as the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking, and the Innovation and Networks Executive Agency (INEA), an executive agency of the European Commission as well as £1 million from the Office of Zero-Emission Vehicles.

The hydrogen bus fleet is part of a larger push for FCEV in public transport. TfL has led the UK procurement within the Joint Initiative for Hydrogen Vehicles across Europe (JIVE) to buy in bulk with other UK authorities. Wrightbus is named the sole supplier of FC double-deckers for Great Britain within the project’s scope. As of November, a total of 55 StreetDeck FCEVs are to be deployed in London, Birmingham (20units) and Aberdeen (15 units).

In total, the JIVE project says it seeks to deploy 139 new fuel cell buses and associated refuelling infrastructure across five European countries and has received funding from the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking. With JIVE II, the initiative now targets to deploy nearly 300 hydrogen-powered buses. Apart from UK cities, municipalities in Germany, France, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Iceland are also taking part.

How 5G technology is as simple as it is revolutionary - Air Liquide,"Fri, 04 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvaW5kdXN0cnkvaG93LTVnLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktc2ltcGxlLWl0LXJldm9sdXRpb25hcnnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Automated cars, intelligent production lines organising, and remote medicine: these are just some of the applications for 5G mobile broadband which – as futuristic as they sound now – will have been made possible by the new networks before the end of the decade.

The surge in demand unleashed by the 5G roll-out is good news for AirLiquide’s customers in the semiconductor industry. So how exactly does the technology behind the new infrastructure work? Join us as we look into radio frequencies, targeted transmission, and antenna arrays in the fifth-generation mobile networks.

As revolutionary as the effect of 5G will be, its technology is by no means hard to explain. At its heart, the raft of 6,400 patents which make up the standard breaks down into three key technologies – increased spectrum, beamforming, and massive MIMO antennas. The principles behind these three elements have been understood for decades: it is the fact that the technical and engineering challenges associated with their implementation have now been mastered which has made 5G feasible – and which will unleash the full power of their combined effects.

How exactly does the technology behind 5G work?

Increased spectrum is the simplest technical principle: while existing mobile networks are in the 0-6 GHz spectrum, 5G will see them expand up to 52.6 GHz. The benefit of opening up these higher frequencies is that they are faster (literally: more frequent) and so enable down- and upload speeds into the tens of gigabytes per second at low latency (i.e. with no delay). The one drawback of using this spectrum is that each station can only cover a limited distance compared with lower frequencies, and that building penetration is poorer. This means that 5G will lead to a larger number of base stations, especially on the outside of large buildings which contain lots of users and devices.

Beamforming can be taken literally: it is about forming beams – i.e. directing radio waves to a target rather than simply broadcasting them in all directions. Put simply, this technology identifies the most efficient path from antenna to receiver, increasing signal quality.

Massive MIMO antennas sound more complicated than they are: MIMO stands for “Multiple-Input, Multiple-Output”, and they work on the principle of providing multiple – think hundreds – of antennas in one array. Thus far, each 4G phone mast has a few antennas to serve hundreds or potentially thousands of devices at any one time. MIMOs attempt to switch this ratio round: if transmitters are equal to or outnumber users, no users will have to wait. In figures, this means that where 4G allows an average of 100,000 connections per square kilometre, 5G will allow a million connections in the same surface area. As well as putting an end to calls cutting out and mobile data dropping in busy areas, it will allow around ten times as many devices to connect: and since people will not have ten times as many smartphones, this opens up capacity for things to connect to the internet, too."
