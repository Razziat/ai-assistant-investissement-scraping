2021 Results: An excellent year across all performance criteria - Air Liquide,"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL2dyb3VwL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzLW5ld3MvMjAyMi0wMi0xNi8yMDIxLXJlc3VsdHMtZXhjZWxsZW50LXllYXItYWNyb3NzLWFsbC1wZXJmb3JtYW5jZS1jcml0ZXJpYdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Commenting on 2021, Benoît Potier, Chairman and CEO of Air Liquide, stated:

“In 2021, the Group achieved an excellent performance, in spite of the ongoing pandemic and the strong inflationary pressures mainly related to the sharp increase in energy prices in the second half.

Air Liquide’s teams have stepped up in all areas, whether in response to the covid-19 crisis, the significant acceleration in inflation or the energy transition challenge, once again demonstrating their strong reactivity and adaptability. We have taken action in the here and now, while at the same time preparing the future. Our investment momentum has been sustained, with the signature of numerous agreements in particular related to the energy transition.

The Group has delivered another year of profitable growth: Sales reached 23.3 billion euros, up +8.2% on a comparable basis, the operating margin increased by 70 basis points excluding the energy impact, and recurring net profit ([1]) rose 13.3% at constant exchange rates.

All activities improved markedly: Gas & Services, which represents 95% of Group revenue, Engineering & Construction, as well as Global Markets & Technologies. All Gas & Services business lines and regions grew to high levels, with Asia growing by +6%, Europe by +7% and the Americas by +8%.

The Group further improved its operating margin thanks to an inflation-adapted pricing policy, significant efficiencies of 430 million euros and a dynamic management of its business portfolio. Faced with a sharp and sustained rise in energy prices, the Group has demonstrated both the strength of its business model – which allows it to automatically pass on these variations to its Large Industries customers – and its ability to rapidly adapt its pricing for Industrial Merchant customers.

Air Liquide’s balance sheet has been further strengthened. Recurring ROCE reached 9.3%, approaching the 2023–2024 target of more than 10%. Cash flow from operations remained high at 24.5% of sales, excluding the energy impact, and helped reduce debt while also financing our capital expenditures and the dividend. Investment decisions reached 3.6 billion euros for the year, and opportunities remained high at 3.3 billion euros, of which more than 40% are related to the energy transition. The dividend, which will be submitted to the shareholders’ vote in May, is proposed at 2.90 euros per share, which represents an increase of +5.5% that reflects our confidence in the future. Moreover, a free shares attribution will take place in June 2022.

With a business model that combines financial and extra-financial performance, Air Liquide is particularly well positioned in the markets of the future. In response, notably to the major challenges of climate change and the energy transition, the Group offers a wide range of solutions based on hydrogen and technologies to decarbonize industry. Contributing to a sustainable future is at the heart of our activity and of our strategy.

In 2022, assuming no significant economic disruption, Air Liquide is confident in its ability to further increase its operating margin and to deliver recurring net profit growth, at constant exchange rates.([2])”

Group revenue for 2021 totaled 23,335 million euros, up +8.2% on a comparable basis. This strong sales growth in 2021 follows the year 2020 that saw the Group demonstrate resilience in an especially tough sanitary environment. Sales in 2021 were up +6% ([3]) compared with 2019. Notably driven by projects related to the energy transition, consolidated revenue from Engineering & Construction was up +55.4%. Global Markets & Technologies posted growth of +17.8%, which was buoyed by the momentum of the biogas market. Energy prices saw an exceptionally strong increase during the 2nd half of the year, especially in Europe, resulting in a significant energy impact on the sales, at +8.4% for 2021 and even +16.5% in the 4th quarter. Currency and significant scope impacts were negative, at -1.6% and -1.1% respectively. All in all, the Group reported growth of +13.9% in published revenue.

Gas & Services revenue in 2021 totaled 22,267 million euros, a strong comparable growth of +7.3%. Gas & Services sales were up +13.3% as published in 2021: the energy impact (+8.8%) hit record levels, especially toward the end of the year. This was partially offset by unfavorable currency (-1.6%) and significant scope (-1.2%) impacts. The significant scope impact results primarily from the acquisition of 16 Sasol air separation units in late June 2021, the divestment of Schülke in 2020 in Healthcare and the reduction or sale of the Group’s stakes in several non-strategic distributors in 2020 in Japan.

Gas & Services revenue in the Americas totaled 8,445 million euros in 2021, up by +7.6% on a comparable basis. Large Industries sales were up +7.6% driven by high demand, and the start-up and ramp-up of new units. The Industrial Merchant business continued to recover, with a +6.9% increase in revenue. Healthcare sales were up +13.7% for the year: teams remained focused on fighting the pandemic and business activity gradually returned to normal, particularly in the United States in proximity care. Electronics posted solid revenue growth of +5.2% in 2021.

Revenue in Europe was up +7.0% on a comparable basis in 2021 to 8,315 million euros . Large Industries sales (+5.2%) were driven by the strong customer activity in the Steel and Chemicals markets as well as a gradual recovery in Refining. Industrial Merchant activity grew strongly by +10.8%, benefiting from dynamic volumes in all markets and geographies, and an acceleration of pricing impacts especially in the 4 th quarter. Healthcare posted revenue that was up by +4.7% on a comparable basis after an exceptionally strong growth of +9.7% in 2020: pandemic-related medical oxygen sales rose strongly in 2021, even if the 4 th quarter sales were below the 2020 record level. Moreover, revenue benefited from the pick-up of Home Healthcare activity and surgeries in hospitals.

Revenue for the Asia-Pacific region in 2021 rose sharply by +6.4% on a comparable basis, totaling 4,790 million euros . Large Industries sales for the year rose steadily by +2.9%: after a highly robust 1 st half of the year, they were down in the second half, mainly resulting from temporary measures of Dual Energy Control in China. The Industrial Merchant business saw a comparable growth of +10.2%, fueled by strong activity in China and the recovery across the rest of Asia. Electronics sales increased by +6.7% in 2021 on a comparable basis, with a significant contribution from Carrier Gases which benefited from the start-up and ramp-up of several units.

Revenue for 2021 in the Middle East and Africa reached 717 million euros, up +12.7% on a comparable basis. Large Industries sales benefited from strong hydrogen demand by customers in the Yanbu basin in Saudi Arabia. Air gases volumes rose sharply in South Africa, as 16 Sasol ASUs (the acquisition of which was finalized in late June) were integrated: in the 2nd half of the year, sales totaled 70 million euros and were recognized as part of the significant scope effect, hence excluded from the comparable growth in 2021. Industrial Merchant revenue continued to grow and Healthcare saw strong growth especially over the first three quarters.

Large Industries sales rose +5.5% on a comparable basis and were driven by strong demand in the Steel and Chemicals markets, as well as a recovery in Refining over the year. Electronics revenue rose +7.0% in a thriving market. Healthcare growth remained strong at +7.2% despite a high basis of comparison in 2020, with teams still focused on fighting against covid-19. The recovery in the Industrial Merchant business continued in 2021, with sales rising +8.4%, driven by a pricing impact of +3.6% for the year, which picked up to reach +7.0% in the 4th quarter.

Consolidated revenue from Engineering & Construction totaled 387 million euros in 2021, up strongly by +55.4% on a comparable basis. Over the year, order intake exceeded 1 billion euros for the first time since 2014, standing at 1,249 million euros. It benefited from positive momentum in Asia, which made up more than half of orders, as well as from the energy transition.

Global Markets & Technologies revenue for 2021 reached 681 million euros, representing a comparable growth of +17.8%. Biogas enjoyed strong momentum, benefiting from the ramp-up of new production units and the rise in sales prices, relating to the energy prices increase, especially in the United States.

Efficiencies([4]) for the year totaled 430 million euros, exceeding the annual target of 400 million euros.

Group Operating Income Recurring (OIR) reached 4,160 million euros, marking a sharp increase of +9.8% and of +12.7% on a comparable basis, which was much higher than the comparable sales growth of +8.2%. The operating margin (OIR to revenue) stood at 17.8% as published, an improvement of +70 basis points excluding the energy impact. On a reported basis, the margin declined by -70 basis points compared to 2020, due to the strong energy costs increase, which are contractually passed through to customers, therefore having a dilutive impact on the published margin. This performance reflected the Group’s capability to quickly translate steep and rapid increase of energy costs during the 2nd half of the year into prices. This also marked the third consecutive year of significant improvement in operating margin excluding the energy impact, following the performances seen in 2019 (+70 basis points) and 2020 (+80 basis points).

Net profit (Group share) stood at 2,572 million euros in 2021, up +5.6% as published and a significant increase of +8.9% excluding the currency impact. Recurring net profit (Group share)([5]) also amounted to 2,572 million euros. This represented a marked increase of +9.9%, and +13.3% excluding the currency impact, compared with recurring net profit (Group share) for 2020.

Net earnings per share, at 5.45 euros, were up +5.5% compared with 2020, in line with the increase in net profit (Group share).

Cash flow from operating activities before changes in net working capital amounted to 5,292 million euros, a marked increase of +7.3% and of +9.1% excluding the currency impact. This corresponds to a high level of 22.7% of sales and 24.5% excluding the energy impact, improving by +40 basis points compared with 2020.

Gross industrial capital expenditure amounted to 2,917 million euros compared with 2,630 million euros in 2020. This represented 12.5% of sales and 13.5% excluding the energy impact, reflecting strong project development. Financial investments amounted to 660 million euros in 2021, representing a marked increase compared with 129 million euros in 2020. These included the acquisition of Sasol’s units for approximately 480 million euros. A total of 21 acquisitions were completed in 2021. Net debt at December 31, 2021, reached 10,448 million euros.

Industrial investment decisions totaled close to 3.0 billion euros and were stable compared with 2020. Financial investment decisions reached 662 million euros in 2021 and included the acquisition of the units from Sasol for approximately 480 million euros. The 12-month portfolio of investment opportunities increased to 3.3 billion euros at the end of 2021, with new entries in the second half-year, notably related to Electronics in Asia and Large Industries. The investment backlog remained stable at the high level of 3.2 billion euros, appropriately distributed across various business sectors and geographies.

The additional contribution to sales of unit start-ups and ramp-ups totaled 345 million euros in 2021, including a 70 million euros contribution by the Sasol units in South Africa in the second half-year. The additional contribution to 2022 sales of unit start-ups and ramp-ups is expected to be between 410 million and 435 million euros. This includes approximately 135 million euros from the 16 units acquired from Sasol at the end of June 2021. Half of this amount will be recognized as part of the significant scope impact.

The return on capital employed after tax (ROCE) was 9.3% in 2021. Recurring ROCE ([6]) was identical (9.3%), representing a marked improvement compared with 8.6% in 2020 and in line with the ROCE target of more than 10% in 2023 or 2024.

At the General Meeting on May 4, 2022, the payment of a dividend of 2.90 euros per share will be proposed to shareholders for the 2021 fiscal year, representing an increase of +5.5% compared with the previous year. The ex-dividend date has been set for May 16, 2022, and the payment is scheduled for May 18, 2022. Moreover, a free shares attribution, on the basis of one free share for every 10 shares held, as well as the application of a loyalty bonus, are planned for June 2022.

Air Liquide’s Board of Directors, which met on February 15, 2022, approved the audited financial statements for the 2021 fiscal year. The statutory Auditors are in the process of issuing a report with an unqualified opinion.

Moreover, Ms. Sin Leng Low whose term of office as Director will expire at the close of the General Meeting of May 2022 also indicated that she does not wish to seek renewal of her office as Director. The Board took due note and thanked Ms. Sin Leng Low very warmly for her contribution to the work of the Board of Directors of which she has been a member since 2014, and for her participation to the work of the Audit Committee of which she has been a member since 2015.

At the close of the General Meeting of May 4, 2022, and subject to the approval of the proposed resolutions, the Board of Directors would accordingly be composed of 12 members: 10 members elected by the shareholders, the vast majority of whom are independent (namely 80% independent Directors) including 5 women (representing 50%) and 4 foreign members, and 2 employee Directors.

The Board of Directors also decided to maintain, in the context of the new separate governance roles, the office of a Lead Director, who shall be appointed from among the independent Directors. A Lead Director, with unchanged powers, will thus be appointed to succeed Mr. Jean-Paul Agon at the Board meeting which will be held at the close of the General Meeting. The new composition of the Committees will be decided at that same Board meeting. This information will be communicated after the General Meeting.

Finally, the Board of Directors will submit to the vote of the General Meeting the elements of Mr. Benoît Potier’s remuneration for 2021, in his capacity as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, together with the information relating to the remuneration of all the corporate officers for 2021.

Hydrogen Council announces leadership change: original founder Air Liquide passes reins to new co-chair Kawasaki ... - Hydrogen Council,"Wed, 02 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vaHlkcm9nZW5jb3VuY2lsLmNvbS9lbi9oeWRyb2dlbi1jb3VuY2lsLW5ldy1jby1jaGFpci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Brussels, February 2nd 2022

The Hydrogen Council is announcing an important change of leadership, as Mr. Yoshinori Kanehana, Chairman of Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. (Kawasaki), becomes a new co-chair of the Council along with Tom Linebarger. Kawasaki is one of the founding members of the Council and a key player in the hydrogen sector advocating for its role in accelerating the decarbonisation of the industry. An innovator and pioneer within the industry, Kawasaki has been leading HySTRA (Co2-free Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain Technology Research Association) and working with its partners on the realisation of the international shipping of liquefied hydrogen, through the operation of the world’s first liquefied hydrogen carrier SUISO FRONTIER between Australia and Japan.

Mr. Yoshinori Kanehana says “I am honored to be appointed as a new Board member and co-chair. We are now at a critical stage in our journey from the demonstration to the commercial stage for the global deployment of hydrogen. It is essential to bring together the knowledge and expertise of the various members of the Council towards our common objectives. Amidst the unprecedented challenges, let me assert my firm belief that the hydrogen industry will rapidly expand and mature by strengthening partnerships with stakeholders including key industries, policy makers and investors. I look forward to working together towards the realization of a global hydrogen economy.”

The Council would like to acknowledge the strong leadership of outgoing co-chair Mr. Benoît Potier, CEO and Chairman of Air Liquide, who has thoughtfully guided members over the last five years. It was his leadership that led to the formation of the Council and under his direction that it has helped elevate hydrogen’s global profile as a viable solution. As Mr. Potier steps away from his co-chair role, he will remain an active Board Member and play an important part in connecting with leaders in Europe on behalf of the Council.

“The Hydrogen Council has come a long way in the last five years, with more than 130 members today compared to 13 at the time of its creation in 2017. It has played a key role in showing the world what hydrogen can bring to a successful energy transition. Today, this role is widely recognized as the total investment into projects and along the whole value chain of hydrogen around the world is estimated at more than $500 billion through 2030. As the hydrogen revolution is entering a new phase of its development, and as I hand over my role as co-chairman to Mr. Yoshinori Kanehana, I am confident that the Hydrogen Council will continue to contribute in maintaining this momentum. I am also looking forward to remaining an active member of the Council to further advocate the incredible merits of hydrogen.” Mr. Benoît Potier, CEO and Chairman of Air Liquide.

Mr. Kanehana will promote the Council’s activities with fellow Council co-chair Mr. Tom Linebarger, Chairman and CEO of Cummins Inc., who began his two-year term in July of 2021.

“I offer my sincere congratulations to Yoshinori as he takes on this new role in hydrogen leadership. I look forward to working closely with him and KHI to further the Council’s vision, which has been deeply influenced by Benoît and Air Liquide, and making meaningful progress together in the journey to global decarbonization.” says Mr. Tom Linebarger, Chairman and CEO, Cummins Inc.

Since its creation, the Hydrogen Council has witnessed major changes in the development of the hydrogen economy. The unprecedented growth of the Council’s membership in the past year is the result of the important shift in a global mindset and constant work from the Council’s members to define a united vision and long-term ambition for hydrogen to foster the decarbonisation of our economies.

Daryl Wilson – Executive Director of the Hydrogen Council, outlines “We are now in the critical and difficult stage of implementation. The industrial project commitments must meet with public priorities, policy and funding commitments to fully realize contribution that only hydrogen can make toward the net zero journey. It is great to have the guidance of strong global leaders in the field as we navigate these next milestones.”

""Apparently, it was plastic vessel that over pressurized and burned. That's what caused the black smoke. At this point, because it is an unknown chemical, we are standing by to verify if it is potentially toxic. But in the fire service, we treat all unknown chemicals as potentially toxic,"" Deputy Chief Zoraida Diaz said at 9:00a.m.

What’s it like running the largest oxygen production plant in the world? - Air Liquide,"Fri, 04 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvdGFsZW50cy93aGF0cy1pdC1ydW5uaW5nLWxhcmdlc3Qtb3h5Z2VuLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tcGxhbnQtd29ybGTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bertus Swart is the Plant Manager for T17, a state-of-the-art Air Separation Unit (ASU) with a total production capacity of 5,000 metric tons of oxygen per day, owned and operated by Air Liquide for Sasol in South Africa. He was responsible for ensuring the startup of this XXL plant and now oversees its operations – so successfully that since 2021, Sasol has entrusted Air Liquide with the operation of the other 16 ASUs on its site.

Bertus, can you tell us about your job?

The plant I manage is the biggest ASU in the world and the most recent addition to the Sasol site. I was brought in during the construction phase in 2016 with the role of getting the team in place to operate it when it was commissioned. Before this, Sasol had been producing oxygen themselves from the 16 units on site – this was the first time they contracted with a third party to supply oxygen and asked Air Liquide to operate and maintain the new plant. Production at T17 started in January 2018, so I had only 18 months to onboard the team and get them ready to work in a plant that was the first of its kind.

And today? How has your job evolved?

Our first three years of operations have proved our value to Sasol in reliability, efficiency and safety. Its core operations are not oxygen production – it’s a chemicals and energy company – so they decided to outsource all the other ASUs on the site to Air Liquide. Our goal is to bring them to the same level of modernization as T17. I’m very involved in providing guidance and support in this transition process.

What do you like about what you do?

What I like most are the challenges: I don’t want a routine job where you come to work and you know what’s expected from you. In my job, it’s never the same day to day, you never know what issues you’ll have to solve. The context is always changing, and I enjoy having to rise to whatever new comes up.

What are some of the challenges?

You always have to be thinking about risks and vulnerabilities and making sure you’re prepared. Some of the equipment is so new and first of its kind that only the manufacturer can provide support. The equipment manufacturers are from Europe or North America, so we have to ensure that long lead times of spares - are delivered and ready at the site. And of course, over the last two years, we’ve had the Covid-19 crisis, which has brought a whole layer of extra complexity …

How has the Covid pandemic impacted your work?

Beyond all the new protocols we created to keep our team safe, we put in place two-way radio communication so when drivers arrive they stay outside to avoid direct contact. We also implemented a new program to allow operators to remotely connect to the computer system (DCS) that operates the plant, allowing staff to be able to work from home if needed.

Of course, one of our products is medical oxygen, and for T17 alone, the demand for this increased by a factor of five. This has been a huge challenge, requiring additional manning and complicated logistics to increase production and organize a sufficient fleet to load and transport the oxygen to hospitals. I’m proud to say that not one hospital here ran out of oxygen due to supply problems from Air Liquide."
Climate-neutral future of steel production: Real-world laboratory of the energy transition H2Stahl project to start at ... - thyssenkrupp,"Sun, 13 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi6QFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aHlzc2Vua3J1cHAuY29tL2VuL25ld3Nyb29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL3ByZXNzZGV0YWlscGFnZS9jbGltYXRlLW5ldXRyYWwtZnV0dXJlLW9mLXN0ZWVsLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tLXJlYWwtd29ybGQtbGFib3JhdG9yeS1vZi10aGUtZW5lcmd5LXRyYW5zaXRpb24taDJzdGFobC1wcm9qZWN0LXRvLXN0YXJ0LWF0LWR1aXNidXJnLXNpdGUtb2YtdGh5c3NlbmtydXBwLXN0ZWVsLTEyOTA3ONIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"



The real-world laboratory of the energy transition that has been granted funding in the amount of 37 million euros by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action will be implemented. By launching the H2Stahl project in Duisburg, the consortium members thyssenkrupp Steel, Air Liquide Deutschland and VDEh Betriebsforschungsinstitut (BFI, project coordination) have now set the course for the first steps. The tasks at hand are the expansion of the use of hydrogen to the entire blast furnace 9, including the construction of a pipeline for testing the large-scale industrial use of hydrogen in steelmaking, as well as the construction and trial operation of a direct reduction pilot plant which will mark the technological leap to hydrogen-based climate-neutral hot metal production. The entire cost of the project to be implemented within a five-year period amounts to a high double-digit million figure.

Industrialization of the use of hydrogen in the blast furnace

On November 11, 2019, thyssenkrupp Steel was the first company globally to inject hydrogen into a blast furnace during operation. Hydrogen replaces pulverized coal as additional reducing agent. The goal is to reduce CO 2 emissions – for unlike carbon, hydrogen does not react in the blast furnace to form CO 2 , but water. The first series of tests funded by the Ministry of Economic Affairs of North Rhine-Westphalia performed on one tuyere of blast furnace 9 in Duisburg was successfully completed. The focus of the project was in particular to gain knowledge about the plant technology when using hydrogen.

Within the scope of the real-world laboratory H2Stahl funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, the use of hydrogen will now be expanded to all 28 tuyeres of the blast furnace. The objective of the research is – amongst others – investigating the influence of the industrial use of hydrogen on the metallurgical processes in the blast furnace and determining parameters for the efficient use of reducing agents. The overall aim is to establish the use of hydrogen as bridging technology for the technical CO 2 reduction in existing blast furnaces. Provided that sufficient quantities of green hydrogen are available, CO 2 emissions can be reduced by up to 20 percent on one plant. The funding is based on the conviction that on the road to the transformation of the energy system the large-scale industrial use of hydrogen will help make the German steel industry not only climate-friendly, but also competitive in the future.

Link to hydrogen infrastructure through new pipeline

Along with the expansion of the use of hydrogen to all 28 tuyeres of blast furnace 9, the internal infrastructure of the plant will be prepared for the large-scale industrial supply with hydrogen. This includes also the link to the existing hydrogen infrastructure of Air Liquide. To secure the continuous hydrogen supply of the blast furnace, the project partner Air Liquide will build an about six kilometers long pipeline linking the steel plant in Duisburg with Air Liquide’s production network. Gilles Le Van, Vice-President Large Industries and Energy Transition Air Liquide Central Europe: “By using hydrogen at Europe's largest steel site in Duisburg, thyssenkrupp and Air Liquide are advancing the decarbonization of steel production. It is a great pleasure for Air Liquide to contribute its know-how thus helping to reconcile effective climate protection and international competitiveness in steel production”.

Direct reduction pilot plant to prepare the technology changeover

As part of the H2Stahl project, a direct reduction pilot plant will also be built in order to prepare the technology changeover from the conventional blast furnace route to the hydrogen-based direct reduction process. The use of hydrogen-containing process gases in combination with natural gas and pure hydrogen is to be tested in the new plant to be designed, which will be operated and scientifically supervised by BFI. Aside from the commonly used feedstock for direct reduction plants, other materials containing iron oxide, including potentially suitable waste materials, will be used. The direct reduction pilot plant will be equipped with additional measurement equipment enabling scientific evaluation. The tests in the direct reduction pilot plant will be accompanied by modeling and special studies in the Technical Center of BFI. The planned research work will focus on the investigation into the reduction processes and process parameters in order to ensure the smooth transition to the future large-scale plants.

“The flexible use of hydrogenous gases as well as various feedstock containing iron oxide in a direct reduction process is quite a challenge. The scientific investigations will provide essential information on the safe and efficient operation of the processes as well as the appropriate operating parameters“, says Michael Hensmann, Head of Resource Technology Feedstock department of BFI, and adds: “The facilities created in the H2Stahl real-world laboratory will enable urgently required investigations with a view to the climate-friendly transformation of the steel industry“. thyssenkrupp plans to complete the first industrial direct reduction plant including melting unit by 2025.

Consistent implementation of the transformation strategy"

French company opens North Las Vegas hydrogen plant - KTNV 13 Action News Las Vegas,"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt0bnYuY29tL3Bvc2l0aXZlbHlsdi9uZXZhZGEtYnVpbHQvZnJlbmNoLWNvbXBhbnktb3BlbnMtZmlyc3QtdS1zLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLXBsYW50LWluLW5vcnRoLWxhcy12ZWdhc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NORTH LAS VEGAS (KTNV) — There is a new production facility that is on the forefront of the emerging market for alternative fuels.

In this week's Nevada Built, Todd Quinones heads north, where a French company is hoping to change the direction of America's energy consumption.

We are travelling on a barren two mile stretch of a desert road north of the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Our destination, a place that is barely on any map.

This is a brand new liquid hydrogen plant, unique to the Las Vegas valley.

APEX INDUSTRIAL PARK

""When you're up here, it doesn't even feel like we're in Las Vegas. It feels like we're sort of in no man's land,"" says Todd. ""No, we are definitely out in the middle of the desert here,"" says Steven Spencer, Plant Manager of Air Liquide's new plant in the Apex Industrial Park in North Las Vegas.

We got a tour of this Nevada Built facility that is about to begin production of liquid hydrogen.

""Pretty much you feel like you guys are ready to go,"" says Todd. ""We're very close to being ready to go. We're targeting being in full production by the end of next month,"" says Spencer.

MOBILE FUEL

Much is being made about electric vehicles being the future of the mobile fuel industry. But Spencer says there is a place for liquid hydrogen in that space.

This plant, owned by the French Company, was built specifically for the California market.

""Our targeted market is the hydrogen mobility market, so that's fuel cell electric vehicles, that ranges from personal cars to forklifts, long haul trucking,"" says Spencer.

Liquid hydrogen is also used to fuel rockets, which gives you an indication of how flammable it is.

""Safety is a huge component and you're saying once this thing gets turned on and becomes operational, we really couldn't be standing out here like we are now in our sort of a plain clothes,"" says Todd. ""No, we could not. I mean, safety is fundamental for us. Once we actually turn on the key and start this facility, this all becomes restricted area. We have to have a full line of PPE on; flame retardant clothing, personal gas monitoring,"" says Spencer.

29 TONS

19 employees will be operating Air Liquide's plant 24/7, producing about 29 tons of hydrogen a day.

""What would you say to people who would say, Well, I'm concerned. Is there some safety concerns for me or my family?"" asks Todd. ""What I would say is there's inherent safety concerns in any facility like this, but a lot goes into, you know, keeping this as safe as possible,"" says Spencer.

To be clear, the U.S. Department of Energy indicates ""A number of hydrogen's properties make it safer to handle and use than the fuels commonly used..."" Spencer adds, he and his team work very closley with area first responders to make sure operations at the plant are safe."

"ArcelorMittal, France Invest Billions in Low-Emissions Steel - Environment News Service","Fri, 11 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZW5zLW5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9hcmNlbG9ybWl0dGFsLWZyYW5jZS1pbnZlc3QtYmlsbGlvbnMtaW4tbG93LWVtaXNzaW9ucy1zdGVlbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"DUNKIRK, France, February 10, 2022 (ENS) – Steelmaking giant ArcelorMittal, based in Luxembourg, is decarbonizing its factories in France and has attracted the financial support of the French Government to accomplish a drop of 40 percent a year in ArcelorMittal’s CO2 emissions in France by 2030.

French Prime Minister Jean Castex visited the ArcelorMittal site in Dunkirk, France on February 4, to announce support from the French Government for ArcelorMittal’s decarbonization program in France, which involves a €1.7 billion (US$1.92 billion) investment from the company in its Fos-sur-Mer and Dunkirk sites.

A total of €5.6 billion will be allocated to decarbonizing industry as part of the France 2030 plan, Prime Minister Castex announced February 4 during his visit to the Dunkirk site, Euractiv France reports.

“The nation is going to make a massive but essential effort to bring our industry fully into the era of decarbonization, to make France a leader in the green industry,” Castex said.

Of the total figure, €5 billion will be for the deployment of new technologies on industrial sites, while the remaining €610 million will be used to support innovation and research for a low-carbon industry.

These investments will enable a profound transformation of steelmaking in the country, representing a 10 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the entire manufacturing industry in France.

Steel is made from iron ore, a compound of iron, oxygen and other minerals that occurs in nature.

The iron and steel sector directly accounts for 2.6 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually, seven percent of the global total from the energy system and more than the emissions from all road freight combined.

ArcelorMittal says the investment puts France’s steelmaking industry on a path aligned with the 2015 Paris Agreement target of keeping global warming of the atmosphere to less than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures.

Eric Niedziela, chairman of ArcelorMittal France and vice president Climate Action ArcelorMittal Europe, commented, “ArcelorMittal is honored that the French State supports our projects. We are proud to have this unique opportunity to contribute to the objectives of the France 2030 plan and to maintain a strong manufacturing industry in France, serving European markets.”

“ArcelorMittal’s management team and its 15,500 employees in France are mobilized to succeed in this new industrial revolution,” Niedziela said, “and we will be happy to welcome new talents willing to participate in this extraordinary adventure.”

ArcelorMittal will implement €1.7 billion of investments by 2030 to accelerate the decarbonization of its steelmaking sites in Fos-sur-Mer and Dunkirk.

Utilizing Recycled Steel, Scrap Steel

In Fos-sur-Mer, ArcelorMittal will build an Electric Arc Furnace. This new unit will complement the ladle furnace announced last March and supported by France’s recovery plan, France Relance. Together, these investments are expected to turn Fos-sur-Mer into a reference site for the production of low carbon, circular steel, made from recycled steel.

At the company’s integrated iron and steel facility at Dunkirk with its blast furnaces, steel plants and rolling mills, ArcelorMittal will build a 2.5 million tonne Direct Reduction of Iron, DRI, unit to transform iron ore using hydrogen instead of coal.

This DRI will be coupled with an innovative electric furnace and completed by an additional Electric Arc Furnace. Other investments are already underway to continue to increase the proportion of scrap steel used.

Yves Koeberlé, CEO of ArcelorMittal Europe, Flat Products, said, “As a leader in steelmaking, ArcelorMittal is committed to decarbonizing its plants in Europe to serve our industrial customers – automotive, packaging, construction, transport but also solar and wind energy and future networks for hydrogen and CO2 capture.”

“We are grateful for this support from the French state,” Koeberlé said. “It will enable a major transformation of our sites in Fos-sur-Mer and Dunkirk, which together account for over one-third of ArcelorMittal’s flat steel production in Europe.”

To decarbonize, ArcelorMittal says the company’s strategy will change the way it produces steel in three ways:

– Increasing the recycling of steel: one kilo of steel produced by ArcelorMittal in France will soon contain up to 25 percent recycled steel

– Developing an innovative DRI process to make steel without coal, with hydrogen

– Capturing residual carbon dioxide (CO2) to store and use

The French multinational industrial gas supplier Air Liquide will support this strategic initiative through the supply of low-carbon hydrogen and the implementation of CO2 capture technologies in Dunkirk, one of Air Liquide’s historic industrial locations in France.

The Air Liquide group has developed expertise in hydrogen production, storage, and distribution, as well as CO2 capture technologies.

This partnership between Air Liquide and ArcelorMittal is a first step towards the creation of an ecosystem at the forefront of low-carbon hydrogen and CO2 capture solutions that will be a source of competitiveness and attractiveness for various players in the Dunkirk industrial and port basin.

François Jackow, executive vice-president of Air Liquide and a member of the Executive Committee supervising Europe Industries activities, said, “Decarbonizing the industry is at the heart of Air Liquide’s strategy. … The time to act is now, and Air Liquide is pleased to support ArcelorMittal in this project aiming to decarbonize a major industrial basin.”

Geert van Poelvoorde, CEO of ArcelorMittal Europe, said, “We count on the strong support of the French and European authorities in order to decarbonize the steel industry. The partnership with Air Liquide will enable us to further accelerate the decarbonization of our steel production and contribute to the creation of a low carbon industrial and port basin.”

The new industrial facilities will be operational starting in 2027 and by 2030 will gradually replace three out of the five ArcelorMittal’s blast furnaces in France.

The transformation of steelmaking operations is expected to generate positive and sustainable employment and industrial activity, especially in the Dunkirk and Fos-sur-Mer areas.

Commenting, ArcelorMittal CEO Aditya Mittal said that in 2021, “We intensified our commitments to decarbonize, recognizing that steel can and must make a significant contribution to achieving net zero. We stated an ambition to reduce our CO2e intensity by 25 percent by 2030 and continue to invest in multiple technology routes that will help us succeed.”

“Our aim is to demonstrate what is possible by having the world’s first near zero-emissions steel plant,” Mittal said.

ArcelorMittal has set ambitious objectives: a 35 percent reduction in CO2 emissions in Europe and a 25 percent reduction globally by 2030; plus carbon neutrality by 2050.

The partnership between ArcelorMittal and the French government for the decarbonization projects is subject to European Union approval, which is anticipated by the second quarter of this year, as well as the availability of economically viable energy infrastructure and supply.

ArcelorMittal also is planning to build a large-scale plant for the direct reduction of iron ore and an electric arc furnace at its site in Bremen, Germany, as well as an innovative DRI pilot plant and an electric arc furnace in Eisenhüttenstadt, following the announcement last March of Germany’s planned expansion of hydrogen infrastructure.

All these items make it possible to compare the company’s performance to previous years, to understand the impact of any exceptional event on its activity, to make projections for the coming year, and to compare several companies in the same business sector.

Is the strategy of the company that you have invested in a success over time?

When you study a company’s results year after year, and in particular certain key indicators, you are able to better understand its businesses, form an opinion on the quality of its operating performance and the relevance of its strategic choices. Note that these key indicators may vary according to the company’s business sector. For Air Liquide, they are mainly: revenue, operating margin, net profit (Group share) or ROCE.

Some of these indicators may be presented both as “published data” and “comparable data”. The latter enables the company’s performance to be understood by “removing” the impact of external events (such as exchange rate or energy prices) or exceptional events, like the acquisition of a company, to facilitate a comparison from one year to the next.

Air Liquide Normand'Hy: boosting an industrial region through mass renewable hydrogen production - Air Liquide,"Tue, 01 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvaHlkcm9nZW4vYWlyLWxpcXVpZGUtbm9ybWFuZGh5LWJvb3N0aW5nLWluZHVzdHJpYWwtcmVnaW9uLXRocm91Z2gtbWFzcy1yZW5ld2FibGUtaHlkcm9nZW7SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Port-Jérôme and the Seine estuary. This industrial hub in the Seine-Maritime department (France) has fully embraced the energy transition. Numerous initiatives are springing up and the brand-new Air Liquide Normand’Hy project is part of this movement. Major changes are afoot, with the commissioning, from 2025, of a PEM (Proton Exchange Membrane) electrolyzer with a minimum capacity of 200 megawatts. The ultimate ambition is to create the first low-carbon hydrogen network in the world. Find out more!

When you arrive in Port-Jérôme-sur-Seine, the Air Liquide hydrogen production unit is not hard to spot, sitting close by the major refiners present in this important French and European industrial area. But firstly, what is hydrogen used for in the refinery sector? To desulfurize – in other words to reduce the sulfur content of hydrocarbons – a vital process. With the climate challenges we are facing today, the supply of carbon-intensive hydrogen needs to be gradually replaced with renewable and low-carbon hydrogen capable of reducing manufacturers’ carbon footprint. ""We are very much in favor of this type of project,"" explains Erwan Keromest, Director of the TotalEnergies platform in Normandy. ""At our site, we aim to reduce CO 2 emissions by 30% to 40% by 2030. Renewable and low-carbon hydrogen will allow us to eliminate carbon from a number of our processes.""

""Scaling up"" is the key to the energy transition for all manufacturers. ""From the moment Air Liquide became involved in this project, we thought ‘bingo’,"" recalls Virginie Carolo-Lutrot, President of the Caux Seine Agglo local urban authority, with characteristic passion. ""When a prime contractor of this size joins this type of project, which aims to secure the industrial future of the site as well as to develop new sectors, and which has focused its latest investments on creating a virtuous circle, it indicates a good level of political maturit."" In fact, Air Liquide Normand’Hy will very quickly establish itself as ""a major asset in decarbonizing Normandy’s industrial heartland,"" according to François Jackow, Executive Vice President and member of the Executive Committee of the Air Liquide group. The secret lies in the now-recognized expertise of Air Liquide’s researchers, engineers and technicians in the development and operation of PEM electrolyzers. The goal is both ambitious and very clear: to create the first low-carbon hydrogen network in the world, capable of supplying all industrial customers in Normandy, as well as hydrogen fuel stations for transport, primarily trucks.

Large-scale production for large-scale decarbonization A PEM (Proton Exchange Membrane) electrolyzer uses well-known technology, which basically involves separating the water molecule (H 2 O) using electricity generated from a renewable source. This separation of the water molecule releases the hydrogen molecule. Producing a large quantity at an acceptable cost is not so easy, however. But this is the feat that has been achieved by Air Liquide in Canada, with the largest PEM electrolyzer in operation in the world, at 20 megawatts, inaugurated in January 2021. And the capacity of the future project in Normandy will be more than 200 megawatts – enough to meet the very significant needs of refiner customers. As Virginie Carolo-Lutrot rightly points out, ""The decarbonization of industry necessarily requires mass production of low-carbon hydrogen."" Now let’s turn to carbon emissions. With this project, from 2025 Air Liquide Normand’Hy will avoid 250,000 tons of annual CO 2 emissions. This certainly represents a real change of scale and will radically transform the region.

The Normand'hy project has been pre-notified to the European Union by the French authorities as part of the call for IPCEIs (Important Projects of Common European Interest) in the hydrogen sector.

Supplying renewable hydrogen to heavy transport operators Reducing the carbon footprint of an industrial region also involves reducing the carbon emissions of the vehicles that pass through it – especially trucks. The low-carbon hydrogen produced by Air Liquide Normand’Hy will be distributed to charging stations where heavy vehicles will come to refuel. It is probably unnecessary to recall that driving a hydrogen vehicle emits no CO 2 emissions or fine particulate matter. Using renewable hydrogen supplied by Air Liquide Normand’Hy also means that emissions are reduced at source. It is easy to see why the heavy vehicles used in Port-Jérôme in Normandy will have very little in common with those in use today…"
Peng Shen: #ExceptionalCareers at Air Liquide - Air Liquide,"Thu, 03 Feb 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvdGFsZW50cy9wZW5nLXNoZW4tZXhjZXB0aW9uYWxjYXJlZXJzLWFpci1saXF1aWRl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Peng Shen is celebrating 10 years at Air Liquide and an enriching career. He joined the Group first as an intern before returning as a researcher in the Electronics division. After eight years, he jumped to the Business line, holding several roles before serving as Special Projects Manager to Air Liquide Japan’s CEO, Virginie Cavalli. This past year, Peng moved to the Industrial Merchant business line, where he worked as Deputy General Manager before being promoted to General Manager, a role he will take on in March 2022.

2007: Air Liquide through the eyes of an intern

Without knowing a word of Japanese, Peng moved to Tokyo from China to pursue his graduate studies in chemical engineering and advanced nanotechnology. Along with diving into a new language and culture, he embarked on a summer internship... Or the start of his learning journey at Air Liquide!

""Air Liquide’s work on advanced specialty materials was interesting and similar to what I was doing at university. But beyond that, I could tell that Air Liquide respected the technology. Employees aren’t pushed to simply generate a product; they are given the room to think about why it’s needed and the support to make it happen. There aren't many companies working in this way, and I left my internship convinced that Air Liquide was one of the best. I also believed I had knowledge to contribute. After I earned my PhD, I chose to join the Group as an employee, returning in 2011.""

2011: becoming an expert innovator

Over his eight years in Electronics Research, Peng received Air Liquide’s BeInnovation award twice. This award is given annually to employees who are spearheading particularly innovative projects. His first award, received in 2016, was for building up a family of products that reduce CO 2 emissions. The second, in 2020, was for one of his patents.

""We started this award-winning research project in 2012, around when I joined the company. Air Liquide already held a pioneering view of innovating for the environment and planet, and was giving us the resources and long-term support to do it. My second award was a moment of double recognition, as I was also nominated to serve on the committee of an international conference in Japan. I was proud to be the only committee member from a gas company or material supplier. Air Liquide provided me with a platform to meet our customers, allowing me to be recognized by the industry as an expert in semiconductor work.""

2019: from R&D to business

Peng knew that there was more to learn at Air Liquide, and was eager to accept opportunities that arose.

""For a long time, I wasn’t interested in becoming an expert in only one domain. I wanted to learn different things, which meant taking challenges outside of research. Air Liquide listened to my ambitions: in meetings with HR and the Talent Development team, I explained the kind of areas I wanted to work in and they told me the skills I needed to develop. These were always great interactions, clear and efficient. A key moment for me was when I was given the opportunity to change my job scope. I moved from R&D to Business, a huge jump! In my two years in business, I held three positions. My learning was on-the-job, happening during meetings or discussions, and I had many opportunities to interact with people and to absorb a lot of information in a very short time. Letting the people from R&D enter the business side is brave. I think it says a lot about Air Liquide: they truly want to develop their employees’ competencies and encourage them to learn new things. When I moved, I wasn’t a fresh graduate in a career rotation program. I had been in R&D for eight years!""

2020: Special Projects Manager to Air Liquide Japan’s CEO

Peng’s ambition led to an opportunity to work directly with the CEO of Air Liquide Japan."
