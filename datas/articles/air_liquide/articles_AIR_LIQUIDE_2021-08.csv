Towards a new approach to value-based healthcare - Air Liquide,"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvaGVhbHRoY2FyZS90b3dhcmRzLW5ldy1hcHByb2FjaC12YWx1ZS1iYXNlZC1oZWFsdGhjYXJl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Improving the quality of life of patients requires an overhaul of the continuum of care. As a leading home healthcare provider, this is our conviction. Doing so requires putting the benefits expected by our patients first and measuring them. Air Liquide, in partnership with healthcare professionals, is coordinating an approach which favors personalized support programs for patients in their homes. This approach has reached a new level with the health crisis.

“In Europe, doctors and healthcare coverage organizations are becoming increasingly interested in providing global support to patients which focuses on the results of their treatment. We are even seeing experiments into reimbursement based on the results achieved for patients and their health, rather than a standard fee for all.”

The Group, faced with the urgency of the situation , was instantly mobilized to face the healthcare challenges. “To assist patients suffering from Covid-19 or other chronic illnesses and to reduce the load on hospitals, we have introduced new solutions in several countries: home oxygen therapy with remote monitoring, outpatient infusion pump treatment for people living with Parkinson’s disease, multidisciplinary teamwork...” explains Dolores Paredes, Head of Markets, Strategy and Innovation at Air Liquide’s Healthcare business line. ""Patients have emerged from this crisis with a greater role to play in their own healthcare. This is a trend that we wish to accelerate and support,” analyzes Dolores. The Group’s strength to sustain this momentum is the presence of specialized teams, in close proximity to their patients at home. These teams are the best placed to be able to offer personalized care, which aim to contribute to the improvement of the patients’ quality of life.

Taking action with patients and doctors to contribute to healthcare advances, this is Air Liquide’s ambition. For several years, the Group has been developing innovative patient centric solutions, to improve patient follow-up and quality of life. This momentum has been driven by major trends: an ageing population, greater demand for home healthcare and the development of digital technology which is revolutionizing medicine. Three trends, confirmed by the health crisis, that have transformed the world of healthcare and the lives of millions of people. The Covid-19 pandemic has, indeed, reinforced the need for a more personalized approach to patient care for those suffering from chronic diseases that are treated at home (respiratory failure, sleep apnea , diabetes, Parkinson's disease).The crisis thus contributed to developing outpatient care 1 .

“This continuous dialogue with patients confirms the idea that a new approach to healthcare in which they have their place in the decision making process is essential,” continues Dolores Paredes. “The question is no longer only how many treatments are required but also to discuss with doctors what is most important in the patient’s view. Do they want to return home soon to be with their loved ones? Receive support regarding continuing long-term treatment? Have more contact with health professionals? Our strategy is to develop an approach to healthcare which is based on the results that are important to the patient, balanced against the cost of achieving them.” In practical terms, this requires a holistic continuum of care which combines a close relationship with patients in their homes with multidisciplinary teams (doctors, nurses, technicians, etc.) and digital innovations that can continuously assess benefits for the patients.

These are key to developing a personalized approach to treatment, in cooperation with the prescribing doctor. An approach which takes into account a patient’s physiological data, lifestyle and family situation. In this respect, the patient is at the heart of the system, and the entire healthcare ecosystem benefits from this: the doctor can rely on Air Liquide’s teams to monitor the observance of treatment, especially for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.

“Supporting our teams to help them identify the true expectations of our patients as best as possible. This is the first step in our transition toward a value-based approach. We are working with doctors and nurses to identify the benefits of the approach, both for their patients and for healthcare systems in Northern European countries.” Gonzague Dehen



Managing Director of Nordic Infucare, Air Liquide subsidiary

From theory to practice

“At Air Liquide, we have launched an ambitious program to transform our activities in order to introduce this new value-based approach. Twelve of the Group’s countries in Europe have set their own targets in terms of optimizing the continuum of care, creating specialized offers for each pathology and forming strategic partnerships, as it is important to bring together the entire ecosystem,” explains Dolores Paredes. The success of this international project depends, in particular, on the creation of digital platforms to facilitate the measurement and monitoring of results from the care provided and the related costs.

Several initiatives have already been launched in all of these countries. For example, in Sweden, our subsidiary Nordic Infucare has launched Birgitta, a services transformation program for patients suffering from diabetes or Parkinson's disease. For the latter, the new and resolutely proactive care model focuses on the “3Ps”: Prediction (when the patient requires care and attention), - Prescription (patient follow-up and referral to the specialist when needed) and Prevention (how to slow the progression of the illness). “Our flagship program, and the most advanced, PIMA2, has been endorsed by the Value Based Healthcare Center Europe3,” welcomed Dolores Paredes. This program is based on an obvious observation: each patient with sleep apnea is different, therefore why offer the same support to them all? By customizing the approach, the goal is to increase the adherence to treatment and ultimately improve the patient's quality of life. This initiative, which was first launched in Spain, has already been adapted for patients in Portugal, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands. In France, an agreement with the Chair of “Innovation and Value in Health” at the University of Paris School of Medicine has been reached, aimed at supporting academic research into this new approach, in particular for chronic diseases. At the same time, patients in ten countries have been surveyed in order to better understand their expectations in terms of results. After all, surely the patients are the best placed to teach us how to restore meaning and value to care? The floor is theirs. And this is just the beginning.

Naturally gas! - Air Liquide,"Thu, 05 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvYmlvbWV0aGFuZS9uYXR1cmFsbHktZ2Fz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Biomethane is an upgraded form of biogas which can be used to fuel trucks, fed into the grid or used for industrial applications in place of fossil-based natural gas. Moreover, as it is produced from waste products, this renewable form of natural gas has a highly positive environmental impact. These characteristics have not gone unnoticed, as the UK government regulations begin to favor biomethane and business to discover its potential. Developments which, with its strong position in the market, Air Liquide is driving forward.

Already present in the UK market, biomethane has experienced a fast evolution in recent years. Between 2019 and 2020 alone, for instance, the Gas Vehicles Network registered a 78% leap in the number of gas-powered heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) in the UK fleet – which, in stark contrast to its European counterparts, is only 7% reliant on natural gas from fossil sources. That’s because the primary source of fuel for gas trucks in the UK is environmentally-friendly biomethane, a purified biogas which also has the potential to substitute fossil gas in the UK domestic gas heating grid and several large-scale industrial applications.

Biomethane explainer







Most organic matter can be turned into gas. To make biogas, a feedstock composed of agricultural produce or waste is broken down in an oxygen-free environment – a process known as anaerobic digestion.







By filtering off the carbon dioxide and other contaminants in the resulting biogas thanks to an Air Liquide proprietary membrane technology, pure methane can be produced. This biomethane, also called renewable naturalgas, is of the same purity and has the same energy content as natural gas from fossil sources. As such, it can be injected straight into the grid or used as fuel.

With 85% of UK homes connected to the country’s extensive gas grid, replacing even a small percentage of natural gas with biomethane would have a major impact on the country’s carbon emissions. What is more, the fact that biomethane can be substituted everywhere where natural gas is used makes it a carbon-neutral source of energy for industrial processes which cannot be electrified, for instance. And for road-hauliers and retailers with logistics operations, biomethane is already helping them to cut emissions in their truck fleets.

Of course, the environmental benefits of biomethane are dependent on the feedstock used to produce it. “When we at Air Liquide began looking at biomethane around 2014,” says David Hurren, UK CEO Air Liquide Biogas Solutions Europe, “it was clear that we had to avoid impacting land use. As such, the Air Liquide biomethane solution is based wholly on organic waste streams such as food waste, and industrial residuals. Although I should specify,” he cautions, “that we don’t like the term ‘waste’: what we’re actually talking about are resources for the green energy transition.”"

Russians offer Chinese oilmen a taste of Arctic methanol - The Independent Barents Observer,"Sat, 14 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYmFyZW50c29ic2VydmVyLmNvbS9lbi9pbmR1c3RyeS1hbmQtZW5lcmd5LzIwMjEvMDgvcnVzc2lhbnMtb2ZmZXItY2hpbmVzZS1vaWxtZW4tdGFzdGUtYXJjdGljLW1ldGhhbm9s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The plans to build a methanol plant on the remote Pechora coast were on the agenda when nine Chinese energy companies this week were invited to an investment meeting with Russian developers.

Among the projects presented was the Indiga methanol plant, the Ministry of the Far East and Arctic informs.

It is company RusKhim that is developing the project that envisages an annual production of 1,8 million tons of methanol. Included in the plans is the building of a terminal facility on the coast of the Pechora Sea. Gas condensate from the nearby Korovinskoye and Kumzhinskoye fields is to fuel the plant.

Today, Indiga is a village on the Nenets tundra with a population of about 600. That number could soon multiply. In only few years, a huge plant run by several hundred workers might rise among the rickety houses.

The new industrial project is estimated to cost about 200 billion rubles and RusKhim is in dire need of investors. The Chinese has the cash needed. According to the Development Corporation of the Far East and Arctic, the nine Chinese companies represented in the meeting are making total revenues of $850,5 billion.

From before, RusKhim has teamed up with the Russian Direct Investment Fund, and negotiations over project financing is held with bank VEB.RF, newspaper Kommersant reports.

Ruskhim intends to launch the project in 2026.

This summer, the company signed a cooperation agreement with Air Liquide, the French natural gas technology company.

“This marks the start of construction of a new petrochemical complex in our region,” Head of the Nenets Autonomous Okrug Yuri Bezdudny said after the signing ceremony at the St.Petersburg Economic Forum.

RusKhim is owned by businessmen Vitaly Yuzhilin (50%), Gennady Mirgorodsky (25%) and Dmitry Ozersky (25%).

In 2020, they acquired the company Alltech that previously intended to build a LNG plant in Indiga. Alltech cooperated closely with Rosneft and together the two companies planned major deliveries of liquefied natural gas from site. However, the project failed to materialize partly because of insufficient gas reserves, partly because the partners failed to obtain the necessary export licenses. Furthermore, in early 2020 Alltech owner Dmitry Bosov died.

On an industrial scale, methanol is predominantly produced from natural gas. Global annual production is estimated to about 20 million tons."

"Blue hydrogen serves as low-carbon bridge to green hydrogen future, experts say - S&P Global","Fri, 27 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zcGdsb2JhbC5jb20vbWFya2V0aW50ZWxsaWdlbmNlL2VuL25ld3MtaW5zaWdodHMvbGF0ZXN0LW5ld3MtaGVhZGxpbmVzL2JsdWUtaHlkcm9nZW4tc2VydmVzLWFzLWxvdy1jYXJib24tYnJpZGdlLXRvLWdyZWVuLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLWZ1dHVyZS1leHBlcnRzLXNheS02NjMyMTc3NtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Green hydrogen production through electrolysis using zero-carbon power will remain more expensive than other pathways in many parts of the world through 2030, research from Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy found.

Source: CNW Group/Air Liquide

Blue hydrogen will be critical to scaling-up the global hydrogen market as the cost of producing low-carbon supplies from renewable energy gradually falls through 2030 and beyond, according to energy system experts.

A new report by Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy, or CGEP, outlined the cost and process challenges facing green hydrogen, which is produced through electrolysis using zero-carbon power. Hydrogen produced from natural gas paired with carbon capture technology, known as blue hydrogen, can essentially function as a bridge to a hydrogen economy dominated by green supplies, panelists at an Aug. 26 CGEP webinar said.

Hydrogen demand could reach 530 million tonnes per year by 2050, yielding 6 billion tonnes per year in carbon abatement, panelists noted, citing projections from the Hydrogen Council, a consortium of companies that support hydrogen development. The cost of hydrogen will determine whether the fuel can deliver on that potential, according to Alex Zapantis, a general manager at Global CCS Institute, a carbon capture and storage think tank.

""Blue hydrogen is well positioned to kickstart that rapid scale-up because it's available, it's mature, and has been operating at meaningful scale quite literally for decades,"" Zapantis said.

Green hydrogen's cost problem

Zero-carbon energy is the main cost driver for green hydrogen production, which today averages $6-$12 per kilogram in most markets, the CGEP found. Meanwhile, the cost of blue hydrogen today is about $1.50-$2.40/kg, based on gas prices ranging from $3-$11/MMBtu, according to an earlier report from the Global CCS Institute.

The CGEP projected that despite efforts to slash green hydrogen costs, the fuel's mean levelized cost will be $4-8/kg in 2030 across three geographic groups: the U.S.; Europe; and China, Japan and India. In some parts of the U.S. and Europe, levelized costs of $2.30-$3.00/kg will be possible where cheap electricity and high capacity factors are available, according to the study the CGEP released Aug. 26.

Yet green hydrogen will likely be cheaper by 2040 and almost certainly by 2050, according to CGEP senior research scholar Julio Friedmann.

""So in the next 20 years, we see a role for both of these fuels, but in the long haul, green hydrogen is going to be the dominant producer of low-carbon hydrogen in the system,"" Friedmann said during the panel discussion. Friedmann previously oversaw U.S. Energy Department research and development into advanced fossil energy systems, carbon capture and storage, and carbon utilization.

Infrastructure challenges are underappreciated

In addition to cost hurdles, electricity and land requirements differentiate blue and green hydrogen, Zapantis said.

For instance, the proposed Asian Renewable Energy Hub project in northwest Australia would use 97 TWh of electricity and cover 5,750 square kilometers of land to produce 1.76 million tons per year of green hydrogen, Zapantis noted. To produce an equivalent amount of blue hydrogen would require 3-7 TWh of power and roughly 17 square kilometers of land as well as 500 kilometers of CO2 pipeline, Zapantis said.

Using that site for hydrogen production makes sense because it has ""fantastic"" renewable energy resources and no opportunity to connect to an established power grid, Zapantis said. However, where there is a grid nearby that draws power from fossil fuel generation, it makes more sense to feed new renewable power capacity into the grid, Zapantis noted. That would deliver greater emissions abatement than using the electric power to produce hydrogen to displace natural gas in a power plant, Zapantis said.

The infrastructure challenges of scaling-up green hydrogen production are underappreciated today, Friedmann said. The CGEP study found that producing 88 million tons of green hydrogen per year by 2030, in line with one International Energy Agency scenario, could cost $2.4 trillion and require 1,238 GW of new zero-carbon power generation capacity.

The cost of building out renewable power supplies, transmission lines and electrolyzers to fulfill 530 million tonnes of demand by 2050 could be on the scale of $14 trillion, Friedmann said. Using a blend of green and blue hydrogen could reduce that cost, Friedmann added.

Blue hydrogen emissions debate

Asked about a recent study that concluded that burning blue hydrogen produced through steam methane reforming carries higher life-cycle emissions than simply combusting gas, Friedmann said the CGEP's study assumed very different conditions.

The CGEP assumed 90% carbon capture from blue hydrogen projects, reflecting targets in recent project announcements and an emerging shift to auto-thermal reformation technology, Friedmann said. The CGEP also assumed less than 1% fugitive emissions from upstream production. Friedmann pointed to the Biden administration's recent moves to regulate upstream methane emissions and the gas industry's push to reduce leaks across the value chain.

With 90% or greater carbon capture, blue hydrogen production from natural gas could achieve a footprint of below 2 kg of carbon per kilogram of hydrogen production, according to the Global CCS Institute. That compares with carbon footprints of 8-9 kg and 22 kg for hydrogen production from natural gas without carbon capture and storage and coal gasification, respectively.

Friedmann said the CGEP would not recommend producing blue hydrogen under less stringent conditions and noted that its assumptions match those used by the International Energy Agency and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. ""We're pretty confident that our initial assumptions are accurate and more representative of both the current and future practice,"" Friedmann said.

The CGEP recommended that policymakers take a colorblind approach to planning and analysis to determine whether blue or green hydrogen production best suited their geography, rather than picking a pathway before understanding the associated costs and challenges."

Hyundai Motor’s XCIENT hydrogen fuel cell truck

Hyundai Motor Co. is investing in H2 Mobility Deutschland GmbH & Co., a German operator of hydrogen fueling stations, as the top South Korean automaker looks to gain ground in the growing European hydrogen-fueled vehicle market.Hyundai will make the equity investment through its German affiliate, the automaker said on Thursday. Hyundai Motor did not disclose financial details, including the investment value and stake size.Since 2017, Hyundai Motor’s German subsidiary has been a partner with H2 Mobility, which is responsible for establishing a nationwide hydrogen infrastructure in the European country.Other investors in H2 Mobility, which operates 91 hydrogen fueling stations in Germany, include France's Total, Shell, OMV, industrial gas makers Linde and Air Liquide, and carmaker Daimler.H2 Mobility Managing Director Nikolas Iwan said Hyundai’s investment will play an important role in expanding Germany’s hydrogen infrastructure as the automaker is leading the hydrogen-fueled commercial vehicle market.Last month, Hyundai said its fleet of fuel cell truck XCIENT has surpassed the benchmark one million kilometers of driving in 11 months of service in Switzerland.The Korean company has shipped a total of 46 XCIENT heavy-duty trucks to Switzerland since July 2020, which are in service for 25 Swiss companies in logistics, distribution and supermarket fulfillment.Hyundai’s XCIENT is the world’s first mass-produced fuel cell electric heavy-duty truck launched in 2019.Hyundai said it will bring the XCIENT to other European countries, including Germany and the Netherlands, to gain a 30% share of the European hydrogen fuel cell truck market by 2030.Hydrogen has come into the spotlight in Europe, where its member governments want carbon dioxide emissions cut by a third by 2030 from 2019 levels, threatening potential diesel bans.Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) are more expensive than battery electric cars (BEVs), but proponents say for long-haul transport, hydrogen-powered trucks have the advantage because they have a greater range.Hyung-Kyu Kim at khk@hankyung.com In-Soo Nam edited this article."
MX3D's 3D-printed bridge unveiled by robot and Dutch queen in Amsterdam - Robotics and Automation News,"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vcm9ib3RpY3NhbmRhdXRvbWF0aW9ubmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wOC8yNS9teDNkcy0zZC1wcmludGVkLWJyaWRnZS11bnZlaWxlZC1ieS1yb2JvdC1hbmQtZHV0Y2gtcXVlZW4taW4tYW1zdGVyZGFtLzQ1ODU0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Dutch technology company MX3D has unveiled what it says is “the world’s first stainless steel 3D printed bridge” in the city center of Amsterdam. The opening ceremony was led by Queen Máxima of the Netherlands, and an ABB YuMi robot.

The futuristic multi award-winning bridge, designed by Joris Laarman Lab with Arup as lead engineer, will be placed over one of the oldest canals in Amsterdam’s Red light district.

The installation of the bridge is the culmination of several years of work.

MX3D kicked off this project in 2015 when it proposed printing a metal bridge with its innovative large-scale, robotic 3D printing technology, creating a playful, inspiring example of how digital tools can create a new form language for architectural objects.

Gijs van der Velden, CEO MX3D, says: “The Bridge is only the beginning for our technology, by now MX3D has introduced its metal printing tool on the industrial market, and with this tool already many companies have started printing like us. I am looking forward to all positive impact and new ideas our client will realize.”

The project was brought to life thanks to funding of the Lloyd’s Register Foundation and the collaboration with a range of industry leaders including ABB, Air Liquide, ArcelorMittal, Autodesk, AMS Institute and Lenovo, which all have helped MX3D realise its bold, ambitious vision.

This collaborative effort saw the bridge brought to life between 2017-2018, when four robots 3D printed the structure using more than 6,000 kgs of stainless steel. The City of Amsterdam granted MX3D bridge a two-year permit.

The proprietary MX3D printing technology uses off the shelf welding robots to build up metal objects layer by layer. The MX3D bridge design was created using generative design and topology optimisation techniques. The combination of those technologies allow for a higher form of liberty and a promise of significant material reduction.

Smart MX3D bridge is a ‘living laboratory’

Innovative in design and technology, the bridge serves as a living laboratory. Equipped with a state-of-the-art sensor network, the “Smart Bridge” is powering a cutting edge research project.

In concert with academic and industry researchers the City of Amsterdam will use the bridge’s data streams to explore the role of IoT systems in the built environment.

For instance: can we use such systems to anonymously analyse crowd behaviour, to help better understand the impact of tourism in the Red Light District.

The project also addresses questions about open data, data ethics, and citizen ownership of city analytics. For this purpose the bridge was granted a two year permit by the city of Amsterdam

Smart sensor network feeds ‘digital twin’

Realising this vision required an extended collaboration between MX3D, The Alan Turing Institute (the Turing), Arup, Autodesk, Force Technology, and the University of Twente.

Between them, they have spent the last three years creating and installing a sophisticated sensor network, to enable real-time data collection, to represent those data flows in live models, and to create usable analytics on top of that data which feeds into a Digital Twin of the bridge.

The bridge’s sensors collect structural measurements such as strain, rotation, load, displacement, and vibration, and also measure environmental factors such as air quality and temperature.

Together, this data is used to create a “digital twin”, an accurate computer model that represents the physical bridge in real time. The digital twin will help engineers measure the bridge’s health and monitor how it changes over its lifespan.

The sensor data will also be used to “teach” the bridge to understand what is happening on it, beginning with the ability to count how many people are crossing it and how quickly.

Having helped initiate the project in 2015, a team of researchers from Autodesk designed bespoke software and served as the primary systems integrator for the smart bridge.

Autodesk software collects data from the sensor network and visualises it in a digital twin model representing the bridge’s response to use in real time.

Autodesk worked closely with the partners of the Data Centric Engineering Programme at the Turing as well as Force Technology and University of Twente to design and install the sensor network. Even in its prototype form, this network was useful when performing structural testing on the bridge.

Load testing and materials testing were both conducted by the Data Centric Engineering team, which proved that the bridge is able to hold at least a 19.5 ton load, well above its ultimate design load.

The UK’s national institute for data science and artificial intelligence, the Turing, began its involvement with the bridge by assembling an interdisciplinary team of data science and AI experts from its Data Centric Engineering Programme.

The Turing is hosting the bridge data for the full two year period covered by the bridge’s current operating permit and has conducted a thorough ethics review of the project to ensure that the scientific goals of the project do not compromise the privacy of the public.

Using a custom data platform, the Turing supports researchers who require access to the sensor data stored in its secure cloud.

The Turing researchers have expertise to develop novel and advanced digital twin models for prototypes of the MX3D bridge and are now applying these techniques to evolve the digital twin of the physical bridge as it is used.

Positive governmental role in enabling innovation

As governments worldwide strive to build smarter cities, this valuable research project helps experts improve the design, operation and safety of future 3D printed structures and IoT systems under all conditions.

As a key partner, the City of Amsterdam shows how local governments can act as facilitators in the introduction of new technologies. The support of the city, stadsdeel Centrum and its CTO office were essential in making this complex project succeed.

The project in turn helped MX3D to gain worldwide success with it’s product: a software license that turns a welding robot into a high end 3D metal printer.

The NOW furthermore funded a project called “Bride”, in which University of Twente, TU Delft, Amsterdam Institute of Metropolitan Studies and MX3D study the social side of a digital world, like the bridge.

Barriers and plot changes

Groundbreaking projects like this inevitably run into barriers and unexpected plot changes.

The original design concept was changed considerably due to engineering concerns and printing it on site turned out unfeasible due to safety and technical concerns.

In March 2017, the printing and assembly of large segments of the bridge began. Final placement had to be postponed nearly 2 years until the renovation of the canal walls was completed and all the formalities were ironed out.

In parallel MX3D engineers have continued working on realizing their vision of robots autonomously 3D-printing infrastructure. A robot was successful in triangulating its position and print while placed on the bridge.

It validated the company’s vision and confirmed that robots printing bridges without human intervention is not science fiction anymore.
