Extreme cryogenics: serving the future - Air Liquide,"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvaW5kdXN0cnkvZXh0cmVtZS1jcnlvZ2VuaWNzLXNlcnZpbmctZnV0dXJl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Extreme cryogenics, the science of ultra-low temperatures (close to absolute zero, or -273,14°C), has been an Air Liquide expertise for many years. Essential for cooling and liquefying many gases, extreme cryogenics is key in many areas, including highly innovative ones.

For more than 50 years, the Group has been developing innovative cryogenic technologies for space exploration. But these technologies also serve a diverse range of industries on planet Earth, from industrial manufacturing and transportation to scientific research.

Optimising the transport of liquefied natural gas (LNG) or biomethane

One particularly successful application is Turbo-Brayton, originally developed to keep biological samples cold on the International Space Station. In orbit since 2006 without any maintenance, this solution is increasingly popular among shipping companies transporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) between producing and consuming countries.

Onboard large LNG tankers, it prevents “boil-off” during transport when the gas, cold in its liquid state (-160°C), warms up and partially evaporates (up to 6 metric tons per hour). To limit the financial losses and the negative environmental impact of these “fugitive” CO₂ emissions, shippers are increasingly requiring shipowners to fit their ships with preventative systems. The efficiency and reliability of the Turbo-Brayton solution also opens the door to renewable energy applications. For example, it can be used to liquefy biogas from recovery plants, which produce methane from household, agricultural and industrial waste. In its liquid form, the gas can then be easily transported to its point of use, such as refueling stations for natural gas vehicles. These initiatives have already been introduced in the Nordic countries in Europe. Having sold around 60 units, Air Liquide will enable savings of around 290,000 metric tons of CO₂-equivalent emissions annually, once all units are in operation.

Ultra-low temperatures for new heights in research

Reinforcing its 60 years of experience in extreme cryogenics, in 2020, Air Liquide acquired an 80% stake in Cryoconcept, a French company specializing in ultra-low temperature refrigeration. This acquisition enables the Group to offer temperatures as low as -273.14°C or 0.01°K above absolute zero, which are essential to many areas of scientific research, as well as the operation of the most powerful quantum computers.

The Group will also be supporting large-scale research experiments, thanks to a new agreement with the Hefei Institutes of Physical Science and the Chinese Academy of Science (HFIPS) to jointly develop and manufacture helium refrigeration systems in China.

Thanks to its technological expertise, Air Liquide is constantly innovating and adapting its solutions to meet the needs of its customers, while opening the path to new markets. This expertise perfectly positions the Group in the race for future growth.

"Air Liquide China to plant 100000 Saxaul Trees in Alxa, Inner Mongolia - Markets Insider","Wed, 17 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL21hcmtldHMuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzL3N0b2Nrcy9haXItbGlxdWlkZS1jaGluYS10by1wbGFudC0xMDAtMDAwLXNheGF1bC10cmVlcy1pbi1hbHhhLWlubmVyLW1vbmdvbGlhLTEwMzAyMjE3NzXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SHANGHAI, March 18, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- On March 17, 2021, Air Liquide China kicked off a new CSR project called ""Air Liquide Saxaul Forest"" in Alxa, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Through a donation of RMB 1 million yuan, Air Liquide China will work with SEE Foundation to plant 100,000 Saxaul trees in Alxa, covering around 1.5 million square meters.

In recent years, the local government of Inner Mongolia has encouraged planting trees in dry areas to combat desertification, boost biodiversity and improve living environment. Adapted to harsh weather, Saxaul, also called Haloxylon, is often a first choice for forestation in the desert. It has long grown roots, often twice or three times the length of branches above ground, to absorb water deep down. Thanks to this characteristic, one Saxaul tree can stabilize 10 square meters of sand. Saxaul trees also offer natural habitat to the saxaul sparrow birds, and its roots host a type of herbal medicine named cistanche which is of high medicinal and economic value. Moreover, Saxaul trees can absorb carbon dioxide, contributing to reduction of carbon emissions.

Air Liquide China has carried out ""Green Action"", an annual tree-planting campaign, since 2009. Present in over 40 Chinese cities, Air Liquide employees organize their own or participate in local tree-planting activities every year. Meanwhile, they also take part in the corporate sustainable lifestyle initiative like ""Green Mobility Day"" to reduce carbon emissions from their daily commuting.

Zhang Li, Secretary-general of SEE Foundation, commented: ""We are glad to reach a consensus and establish cooperation with Air Liquide China in the field of desertification prevention and response to climate change. SEE Foundation is committed to building a social protection platform on which enterprises, environmental protection organizations, and the public join together and take actions to alleviate and solve environmental problems. We will work with Air Liquide China to jointly promote environmental protection and sustainable development with concrete actions.""

Nicolas Poirot, Air Liquide China President and CEO, said: ""We are happy to partner with SEE Foundation to plant trees in Inner Mongolia to reduce carbon emissions and combat desertification. Over the decades, China has been dedicated to forestation to mitigate air pollution and carbon emissions. With the fight against global climate change at the heart of Air Liquide strategy, we will continuously contribute to sustainability through our concrete climate actions.""

Air Liquide China

Air Liquide in China operates nearly 100 plants and employs close to 5,000 employees today. With a strong presence in the key coastal industrial areas, Air Liquide is now expanding into the center, south and west. Its main business activities include industrial and medical gas operations, home health service, Engineering & Construction (designing, manufacturing and installing air separation units/hydrogen facilities), as well as Innovation activities.

Following PPA agreements in the United States and Spain, this is the first PPA signed by the Group in the Netherlands. It restates Air Liquide's commitment to lead the way in the energy transition and to lower its carbon footprint, in line with its Climate Objectives.

Thanks to this 15 year long-term contract, Air Liquide will be able to supply with renewable energy some of its industrial and medical gas production assets in the Netherlands. This includes the first world-scale oxygen production plant fit to accommodate renewable energy in the grid, which the Group is building in the port of Moerdijk.

The renewable energy will come from a wind farm located between 18-36km off the Dutch coast. This offshore wind farm is currently under development and scheduled to be operational by 2023. This will be the first subsidy-free and world’s largest offshore wind farm.

Over the duration of the contract, Air Liquide will source renewable energy equivalent to 15% of the Group's current consumption for its activities in the Netherlands. The wind-generated electricity will save up to 750,000 tons of CO2 emissions over the contract duration. This agreement will expand Air Liquide's offer of low-carbon solutions at competitive prices and give customers the ability to add more renewable content in their end products.

It was in 1999 that I made my first trip to China, specifically to Shanghai, and I have traveled there many times since then, especially during the 10 years that I lived in Southeast Asia. But when I came here once again as the CEO of Air Liquide China in September 2019, I was amazed by how the city had transformed even in the last two to three years. The skyline of Lujiazui area in Pudong still takes my breath away every time I see it.

During the first few months after my arrival, I traveled across China to visit our plants, from Jiangsu to Sichuan, and from Guangdong to Inner Mongolia autonomous region. These trips opened my eyes to the rapid development that is taking place in the country, the all-powerful mobile apps, the extensive high-speed railway network, and the greenery in the vast desert.

Air Liquide has made significant progress in China since the establishment of its first wholly-owned subsidiary in Shanghai three decades ago, benefiting from the country's rapid industrialization and market expansion, as well as highly competent and professional local teams. Business policies and services provided by the central government and local authorities have also played an important role in this process. Governments at different levels work hard to build effective communication mechanisms and platforms to better understand and solve problems faced by entrepreneurs.

I felt strongly about this support when the COVID-19 pandemic struck China in late January of last year. For instance, local transportation authorities in Wuhan and many other cities helped our plants obtain special permits, which enabled us to ensure an uninterrupted medical oxygen supply to hospitals during the lockdown period and to serve other key industries essential to the continuation of life during the crisis.

With the concerted efforts of all sectors, the strict anti-COVID measures paid off and saw business and life return to normal. Thanks to a rapid recovery across all activities in the second half of the year, Air Liquide China managed to create some growth for the APAC region. Fast, efficient and precise services for enterprises reflect the Chinese government's ability to mobilize resources and its determination to create a stable business environment for companies. This greatly enhances our confidence to further expand investment in China.

Last September, President Xi Jinping announced China will aim to reach a carbon dioxide emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Government put forward a goal of achieving carbon peak five years earlier than the national goal. This is very impressive and inspiring. I can see the government's determination and action. Maowusu Desert in Shaanxi province has been shrinking thanks to the forest program there, air quality has dramatically improved in Shanghai and many other cities, and my daughters are learning how to sort and recycle garbage at school. Renewable vehicles are now commonly seen on the road.

Air Liquide is also taking actions to contribute to China's low-carbon transformation, with the goal of achieving sustainable development. We are not only increasing the renewable energy portfolio in our own facilities and improving energy efficiency, but also helping customers reduce carbon emissions and other forms of pollution through innovative eco-friendly solutions. We look forward to working with the Chinese government to promote the application of new energy sources such as biogas and hydrogen as a vector of energy transition.

Looking forward, with the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) in view, I believe Air Liquide will see new opportunities emerge from China's high-quality development and high-level opening-up policies. Furthermore, the completion of negotiations for the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment also indicates China's opening of its market and commitment to creating a better and more level playing field for EU companies in China.

With 2021 signaling the start of a new chapter, Air Liquide will continue to provide safe, reliable, and efficient gas products and services to support China's industrial development and upgrading and energy transition. At the same time, we will work with all of our partners to explore new growth points for the economy and society to build a better world. We are all in this together.

Time to Accelerate the >$300 Billion Hydrogen Project Pipeline - Hydrogen Council,"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vaHlkcm9nZW5jb3VuY2lsLmNvbS9lbi90aW1lLXRvLWFjY2VsZXJhdGUtdGhlLTMwMC1iaWxsaW9uLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLXByb2plY3QtcGlwZWxpbmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This article was first published in H2 View.

By Peter Mackey, VP Strategy & Policy Support, Hydrogen Energy at Air Liquide and Stephan Herbst, General Manager at Toyota Motor Europe, Hydrogen Council Study Leads

Hydrogen deployment across the globe is moving more rapidly than ever before. This trend was unmistakable throughout 2020, but now we also have the numbers to substantiate the enthusiasm: as of early 2021, over 30 countries have released hydrogen roadmaps and more than 200 large-scale projects have been announced along the value chain. Driven by global commitments to decarbonisation and a green recovery, as well as a continuing decline in renewable costs, the current environment provides a hotbed for cleantech innovation and industrial scale-up. The impressive number of hydrogen projects currently in the pipeline around the world can contribute significantly to achieving global climate targets and mitigate a considerable amount of carbon. If all 228 projects announced today are realised, total investments in hydrogen would exceed $300 billion through 2030 – the equivalent of 1.4% of global energy funding.



This new level of maturity for hydrogen shows that we have hit an important threshold of realisation. The urgency to act on climate change has resonated across sectors and geographies, prompting substantial action on the ground to maximise hydrogen’s contribution to the decarbonisation of our economies. In the newly published Hydrogen Council Hydrogen Insights[1] report, developed in collaboration with McKinsey, we investigate key market trends, the investment commitments of Hydrogen Council members, and the industry’s efforts to deliver the cost reduction benefits of industrial scale-up. This provides valuable guidance about the role that hydrogen will play as the industry continues to grow.

Strong policy signals trigger intense business activity

Regulation and government support are a strong impulse for investment. Hydrogen has become a central element of the net zero strategies announced by 75 countries to date, countries which together represent half the world’s GDP. Ambitious clean hydrogen production, adoption and consumption targets – accompanied by appropriate incentives like subsidies and tax credits – are driving momentum. The EU has set a strong example, aiming for 40-gigawatt electrolyser capacity inside the bloc and another 40 gigawatt of annual hydrogen imports by 2030, while several states in the US have committed to bold targets for zero emission vehicles by 2035.

Hydrogen can be harnessed to fit regional needs

Hydrogen’s versatility allows governments to focus efforts on applications that respond to regional priorities, such as industrial decarbonisation, renewable integration, or lowering transport emissions. While Japan and Korea are currently the frontrunners in road transport applications, Europe is investing heavily in integrated hydrogen economy projects. Meanwhile, regions with abundant renewable resources are developing giga-scale export schemes. Options are diverse: hydrogen can be the most competitive low-carbon solution across 22 applications by 2030, including not only commercial vehicles, trains and long-range transport applications, but also fertiliser, refinery, steel, aviation, and shipping applications.

Sector-level strategies drive further scale-up

Hydrogen deployment does not only rely on overarching national strategies, but also requires regulation and targets at the sector level. Transport is a good case in point, with over twenty countries planning to ban sales of internal combustion engine vehicles by 2035, and more than 35 cities covering over 100 million cars setting new, stricter emission limits. Globally, countries anticipate having 4.5 million fuel cell electric vehicles by 2030, with China, Japan and Korea leading the roll-out. In parallel, stakeholders are targeting 10,500 hydrogen refuelling stations by 2030 to fuel these vehicles.



Although the volume of announced investments is significant, there is still work to be done to ensure planned projects are carried across the finish line, while new projects need to continue to fill the pipeline. Partnerships between governments, businesses and investors will be key to define long-term targets, set short-term milestones, and shape the necessary regulatory frameworks, while keeping in mind that low-carbon hydrogen supply at scale is only economically and environmentally feasible if the right localised approach and best-practices for production are applied. To achieve the necessary emission and cost reductions, different hydrogen pathways need to be combined to support regional nuances.[2]

Several new projects have already been announced since we released our Hydrogen Insights report in February 2021. As proper assessment requires careful tracking, the Hydrogen Council will continue to monitor developments on an ongoing basis to help stakeholders accelerate deployment. As an industry, we need to keep working closely with each other as partners, as well as with policymakers and the investment community, to identify the critical “unlocks” that will reduce the cost of hydrogen production and distribution, and support scale-up, so that hydrogen projects can reach commercial viability. This is how we can ensure hydrogen will live up to its full potential.

At the CERAWeek by IHS Markit conference, hydrogen experts and stakeholders expressed confidence that the cost curve will indeed bend in the coming years. The March 2 panel on low-carbon hydrogen production and technologies offered a detailed breakdown of the forces behind the price trend.

Norwegian electrolyzer-maker Nel ASA in January announced a goal of producing green hydrogen at $1.50 per kilogram by 2025. Malaysian oil and gas giant Petroliam Nasional Bhd., or Petronas, is targeting hydrogen production costs from the nation's hydropower and solar resources in a range of $1/kg to $2/kg, Petronas Technology Ventures CEO Mahpuzah Abai said during the panel.

""Those are levels that are very important because they would allow us to really have low-carbon hydrogen compete with the traditional forms of hydrogen that are not low-carbon,"" said Soufien Taamallah, director for energy technologies and hydrogen research at IHS Markit.

Green hydrogen produced with renewable resources costs between about $3/kg and $6.55/kg, according to the European Commission's July 2020 hydrogen strategy. Fossil-based hydrogen costs about $1.80/kg, and the commission estimated the cost of blue hydrogen, which pairs carbon capture with steam methane reformation of natural gas, at about $2.40/kg.

Achieving green hydrogen cost parity

Many companies are now focused on using renewable electric power to produce green hydrogen through electrolysis, the process of splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen. They are often installing proton exchange membrane electrolyzers, an alternative to the alkaline units that have dominated the electrolysis market for decades.

MIT Energy Initiative research scientist Dharik Mallapragada chalked up hydrogen technology cost declines to a factor that is familiar to the utility industry: the vast cost decreases for wind and solar resources that paved the way for large deployments in electric power systems, enhancing opportunities for low-carbon and marginal-cost generation.

Access to low-cost renewable electricity will be the most important factor in driving green hydrogen costs down to $1.50/kg, according to Everett Anderson, vice president for advanced product development at NEL Hydrogen AS.

The electric power price is by far the biggest variable cost when breaking down capital versus operating expenses for electrolyzers, Anderson said. Companies can achieve very high efficiency by operating electrolyzers at reduced capacity, but that will drive up capital costs, he explained. For that reason, companies should consider the total cost of owning an electrolyzer, Anderson said.

He also stressed that electrolyzer operators not only need access to low-cost renewable energy but high capacity factors — in other words, a steady supply of wind, sun or water flow. ""You need the highest capacity factor possible in order to amortize that capital,"" Anderson said.

Electrolyzer cost declines, new applications

Declining electrolyzer technology costs partly explain the surge in hydrogen interest, Mallapragada said. With new players entering the market, the supply chain has broadened to include established companies involved in other synergistic industries, which are now focusing their product development efforts into green hydrogen, Anderson added. That industry-level scaling has helped to drive down costs further, he noted.

At a lower level, design improvements have also led to more efficient use of materials, which in turn improves electrolyzer efficiency, Anderson noted. On the manufacturing side, costs have come down as plants scale up to larger capacity and adopt automation and continuous manufacturing processes, he said.

Beyond more mature low-temperature electrolysis processes, researchers are on the cusp of overcoming challenges presented by high-temperature electrolysis, Mallapragada said. By using thermal energy as an input, high-temperature electrolysis systems present a value proposition in reducing electrical energy requirements. Nuclear power plant operators see this process as a way to transform their high-heat facilities into hydrogen production hubs. Mallapragada said the process could also present synergies with high-temperature processing applications in the industrial sector.

Finally, Mallapragada noted that methane pyrolysis is attracting attention and investment. The hydrogen production process involves decomposing methane at high temperatures to produce solid carbon rather than carbon dioxide. It could allow for hydrogen production at nodes between natural gas transmission lines and distribution systems, he said.

GREEN HYDROGEN: Compared with a traditional plant, the new one is to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 35,000 tonnes per year, the amount absorbed by 1 million trees

By Angelica Oung / Staff reporter





Air Liquide Far Eastern Ltd’s (ALFE, 亞東工業氣體) 25-megawatt ultra-pure, low-carbon hydrogen electrolyzer plant yesterday began operations at the Tainan Technology Industrial Park (台南科技工業區), with the aim of supplying hydrogen gas to the park’s semiconductor manufacturers.

Speaking at the opening ceremony, Tainan Mayor Huang Wei-che (黃偉哲) said that the plant would not only aid the development of the nation’s semiconductor industry, but also open the door to “green hydrogen” applications.

“This is the world’s first ultra-pure, low-carbon hydrogen electrolyzer plant,” Huang said. “It will support the development of all sorts of potential hydrogen applications in Taiwan.”

“This project illustrates the investment opportunities that exist in Taiwan for foreign businesses,” he added.

Air Liquide said the traditional method for reducing hydrogen from methane, or steam-methane reforming, is cheap, but highly polluting.

However, the electrolyzer technology employed by Air Liquide produces highly pure hydrogen without any carbon dioxide.

Compared with a traditional plant, the new plant would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 35,000 tonnes per year — equivalent to how much carbon is absorbed by 1 million trees per year.

ALFE is a joint venture between France’s Air Liquide SA and Far Eastern New Century Group (遠東新世紀集團).

Air Liquide is the world’s leading producer of high purity industrial gases.

In addition to the hydrogen plant in Tainan, the company is building a NT$4 billion (US$141.3 million) facility at the Hsinchu Science Park (新竹科學園區) to produce highly pure industrial gases for the semiconductor industry."

These plants will provide ultra-high purity hydrogen to the semiconductor industry as well as serve emerging hydrogen energy applications in Taiwan. This project is in line with the Group’s Climate Objectives which include the development of hydrogen applications and ecosystems for the industry and other markets.

Air Liquide, through its majority owned joint-venture Air Liquide Far Eastern (ALFE), has completed the first phase of the construction of the hydrogen electrolyzers it has set to build in the Science Parks of Tainan and Hsinchu in Taiwan. Announced in April 2020, as part of a larger 200 million euro investment, these capacities will be able to produce up to 5,000 Nm3 of ultra-high purity hydrogen per hour. After successfully reaching the Phase 1 commissioning milestone, Air Liquide will continue the construction of its Phase 2 to Phase 5 hydrogen electrolyzer plants in Taiwan over the next 2 years for a total capacity of 25MW.

These production plants will enable Air Liquide to meet the emerging demand for ultra-high purity hydrogen for Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUV) applications and leverage a more environmentally-friendly production process of hydrogen to support the environmental objectives of the major semiconductor industry customers in Taiwan.

Once the whole project is completed and the hydrogen plants are supplied with renewable energy, over 35,000 tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) direct emissions will be saved annually when compared to traditional hydrogen production processes.

This new local and reliable low-carbon hydrogen supply will further reinforce Taiwan’s leading position in the semiconductor industry. Moreover, this new hydrogen production plant - the third operated by Air Liquide in Taiwan - will also allow the promotion of low-carbon hydrogen for fuel cell applications, to support the emergence of hydrogen storage or mobility projects in the region.

Martijn Hagens, CEO Vattenfall Netherlands:

“We are delighted that Air Liquide, which has ambitious sustainability targets, will purchase fossil-free electricity from Vattenfall. Long-term contracts like these provide us with financial security and enable us to keep investing in wind and solar farms, a cornerstone in our ambition to enable fossil free living within one generation. The Netherlands is turning to a fossil-free future and we want to make that a reality for our customers.”

Built without subsidies

Hollandse Kust Zuid is the first subsidy free offshore wind farm in the world. It will be located between 18 and 36 kilometers off the Dutch coast, between The Hague and Zandvoort. Construction will start in 2021. In 2023, when the wind farm is operational, the 140 wind turbines will produce more than 6 TWh of green electricity annually. The electricity will be available to households, government and businesses and thus contribute to Vattenfall’s ambition to provide all its Dutch customers with 100 per cent Dutch fossil-free electricity by 2030."
Nigeria mulls construction of Largest Methanol Plant in Africa - CCE l ONLINE NEWS - Construction and Civil Engineering News,"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vY2Nlb25saW5lbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wMy8xNS9uaWdlcmlhLW11bGxzLWNvbnN0cnVjdGlvbi1vZi1sYXJnZXN0LW1ldGhhbm9sLXBsYW50LWluLWFmcmljYS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide Engineering & Construction has signed an agreement with Brass Fertilizer and Petrochemical Company Limited (BFPCL) to support the construction of what would be the largest methanol plant in Africa.

As part of the agreement, Air Liquide Engineering & Construction will be the technology licensor, bringing its extensive experience in the design and engineering of Methanol plants.

The Largest Methanol Plant in Africa, will be located in Odioma, Brass Island, Bayelsa State and will be able to produce up to 10,000 tons of Methanol per day based on Air Liquide Engineering & Construction proprietary process technology for large scale syngas and methanol, Lurgi MegaMethanol™, which efficiently converts natural gas into methanol. The plant is planned to be operational in 2024 and will service local and export markets.

Air Liquide Engineering & Construction is a world leading methanol licensor, with over 50 years-experience in plant design, engineering, procurement and construction offering customers safe, reliable and energy efficient technology solutions.

Brass Fertilizer and Petrochemical Company Limited (BFPCL), is an incorporated entity with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), DSV Engineering, and the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) as the project sponsors and shareholders.

Methanol synthesis

The gas stream obtained from syngas production is then converted into methanol. Our reactors have a long and proven track record. They are available in single-stage water-cooled or two-stage water- and gas-cooled configurations that can be optimized by heat management or interstage condensation.

Methanol distillation

After synthesis, methanol undergoes energy-integrated distillation to produce high-purity methanol (e.g. grade AA and IMPCA grade). The crude methanol is purified in a cost-saving 2-column or an energy-saving 3-column distillation unit. The low boilers are removed in the pre-run column and the higher boiling components are separated in either one or two pure methanol columns.

The Promise of Green Hydrogen - Taiwan Business TOPICS - Taiwan Business TOPICS,"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vdG9waWNzLmFtY2hhbS5jb20udHcvMjAyMS8wMy90YWl3YW4tcHJvbWlzZS1vZi1ncmVlbi1oeWRyb2dlbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Although hydrogen gas emits only water, it does not naturally exist in its pure form and must be generated from another hydrogen-carrying source – usually methane (CH4) – through a process called steam-methane reforming. Cheap and well-established, this process is also highly polluting, generating 10 tons of greenhouse gases for every ton of hydrogen. Hydrogen formed from steam methane-reforming is dubbed “grey hydrogen.”

Electrolyzers can generate hydrogen from water by splitting it into oxygen and hydrogen, but high energy demands make this process costly. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), electrolysis currently accounts for less than 5% of global hydrogen production. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) says that at US$650 per1000/kW, investment costs are still too high for mass installation.

“Electrolyzer technology from a reliability perspective is a mature technology, but not from a cost competitiveness perspective,” notes Olivier Blanchard, General Manager of Air Liquide Far Eastern Ltd., a joint venture between Paris-based Air Liquide and Taiwan’s Far Eastern Group.

Air Liquide is a supplier of industrial gases to Taiwan’s semiconductor and electronics manufacturers, oil refineries, and other industries. Such firms as Air Liquide, Germany’s BASF, and U.S.-Taiwan joint venture Air Products San Fu supplied 458.5 million cubic meters of hydrogen to Taiwan between November 2019 and November 2020, according to the Ministry of Economic Affairs. All of this was high-emissions grey hydrogen.

Air Liquide is also a global champion for hydrogen energy as a key means to decarbonize the economy. It was one of the 13 founding members of the Hydrogen Council, a global association of executives in energy, transportation, and industry formed in 2017 to promote industry awareness and investment. This past April, Air Liquide Far Eastern announced that it was investing nearly US$242 million (NT$6.75 billion) to deploy multiple electrolyzers in its new hydrogen production facilities in the Science Parks of Tainan and Hsinchu, among other plants. The company says the use of electrolysis technology when supplied with renewable energy will reduce CO2 emissions by an estimated 35,000 tons per year.

Electrolysis, an environmentally friendly hydrogen production process, accounts for less than 5% of hydrogen generated globally due to its high costs.

While Air Liquide’s electrolyzers will avoid direct greenhouse gas emission caused by methane steam reformation, they would still cause high emissions through power consumption. These electrolyzers would rely on grid power, 80% of which is still generated through fossil fuels, according to the state-owned Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower). Air Liquide intends to use renewable energy as the power source for these new plants, so that water electrolysis can truly achieve “zero emissions.”

The wide deployment of emissions-free, fuel-free renewable power can overcome the high energy demands associated with electrolysis. In many nations, particularly in northern Europe, renewable energy is widely abundant, making “green hydrogen” both emissions free and financially feasible.

Hydrogen likewise solves the issue of renewable energy intermittency – fluctuations in energy production caused by environmental conditions, which can cause either unpredictable lulls in power or an excess during peak times. Germany, for example, often generates more renewable energy than it can use, and must offload it onto the Polish or Czech grids at a price.

This excess power can be stored in megawatt-scale batteries, which are becoming more economical but for which supply is still limited. Instead, this excess power can be directed toward electrolyzers that generate hydrogen, to then be used in fuel cells to generate electricity again.

Taiwan does not have an abundance of green energy – at least, not yet. So far, Taiwan’s 5,867MW of installed solar capacity, 128MW of offshore wind, and 725MW of onshore wind have yet to generate surplus power. In 2020, renewables, including hydroelectric dams, generated no more than 6% of Taiwan’s total demand, and even on the sunniest days solar generates only about 10% of the total, according to Taipower.

But renewable energy’s share of power supply and generation is mounting steadily. Solar power installations made record gains in 2020, though it has another 14GW to go to meet the government’s goal of 20GW by 2025. And although Taiwan’s offshore wind sector hit some speedbumps in 2020, interest remains high. Developers have crowded into the market, proposing up to 20GW in projects in bids for the 5GW of capacity at stake in the upcoming third round of project allocation. Taiwan aims to add 5.7GW by 2025 and a further 10GW by 2035.

Regardless of how realistic these goals are, Taiwan will certainly see a large influx of renewable energy over the coming years, potentially destabilizing the grid. Solar power capacity of 20GW would generate up to 1,000MWh or more of electricity, meeting 30% of Taiwan’s peak demand.

With solar and offshore wind power combined with Taiwan’s inflexible nuclear, coal, and natural-gas baseload capacity, which constantly generates over 2,000MWh, Taipower would be hard-pressed to manage the total. As an island, Taiwan cannot transmit excess power to other grids or draw power from neighbors if there is a lack of wind or sunlight. Redirecting excess solar and wind power to electrolysis plants that could in turn feed fuel cell power generation would solve the intermittency issue.

“Although Taiwan does not currently have an excess of renewable energy, it will in the next three to five years and we need to start preparing for this now,” says TFCP’s Meg Lin."
From Bass Strait to soft drinks: Exxon strikes carbon deal - The Australian Financial Review,"Fri, 05 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmci5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL2VuZXJneS9mcm9tLWJhc3Mtc3RyYWl0LXRvLXNvZnQtZHJpbmtzLWV4eG9uLXN0cmlrZXMtY2FyYm9uLWRlYWwtMjAyMTAzMDUtcDU3ODdp0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Carbon dioxide extracted from Bass Strait gas could potentially find its way into soft drinks and beer under a deal struck between ExxonMobil, BHP and industrial gases company Air Liquide.

The innovative carbon capture and reuse deal involves France’s Air Liquide building a new CO2 processing plant next to the huge Longford gas plant in Gippsland at a cost in the tens of millions of dollars to treat gas from the Bass Strait fields owned by Exxon and BHP.

The processed and purified CO2 will then be available for use in the food and beverage industry, or in other sectors such as the hospitality, manufacturing and medical industries.

Carbon dioxide from gas extracted from the Bass Strait will be purified for use in manufacturing and medical industries. James Davies

Neither Exxon, the operator of the Gippsland Basin gas venture, nor Air Liquide provided any information on the volume of gas or CO2 involved, or the commercial terms of the arrangement, which Esso Australia described as “long-term”. It comes after Exxon in November scrapped the potential multibillion-dollar sale of its oil and gas assets in the Bass Strait.

Construction of the 65,000 tonnes a year CO2 processing plant is due to start this year, subject to regulatory approvals, creating 60 jobs. Exxon will also build new facilities at Longford to be able to send CO2 directly to the Air Liquide plant. It would otherwise release the CO2 into the atmosphere through flaring so the venture will reduce its emissions at the site."

Air Liquide’s commitment is to make a meaningful difference, with a plan based on three dimensions :

the Abatement of CO2 emissions for a LOW-CARBON society,

Care for patients and

Trust as the base to engage with employees, and to build a best in class governance.

ABATEMENT of CO2 emissions

In full support of the 2015 Paris agreement, the Group’s commitments address the urgency of climate change and energy transition, targeting CARBON NEUTRALITY by 2050 with key intermediary milestones in 2025 and 2035:

to start REDUCING its ABSOLUTE CO2 emissions around 2025

to reach a 33% DECREASE of its Scope 1 & 2 CO2 emissions by 2035[1] compared to 2020

Within this context, the Group also maintains its existing objective to reduce by -30% its carbon intensity in kg CO2/€ Ebitda[2] in 2025, compared to 2015.

To decarbonize its assets, Air Liquide will leverage on capturing CO2, accelerating low-carbon hydrogen production through electrolysis or by using renewable feedstock such as biomethane. With regards to indirect emissions, we will focus on increasing energy efficiency and low carbon electricity consumption.

Air Liquide will also deploy a broad range of low-carbon solutions for its clients to help them decrease their CO2 footprint. This includes low-carbon gases offering, accompanying customers in industrial process transformation, recognized carbon capture expertise, as well as an asset takeover strategy with an objective to decarbonize them.

This plan also includes an acceleration in HYDROGEN development, to at least triple its turnover in order to reach more than 6 billion euros by 2035. The Group will reach that goal by investing approximately 8 billion euros in the low-carbon hydrogen supply chain and by contributing to the development of a low-carbon hydrogen ecosystem for the industry and clean mobility. By 2030, Air Liquide aims at bringing its total electrolysis capacity to 3 GW[3].

CARE for patients

As a major global player in HEALTHCARE, the Group wants to go one step further and to reinforce its societal contribution by improving the quality of life of chronic patients at home in mature economies and by facilitating access to medical oxygen for rural communities in low and middle income countries.

This will translate into:

On the one hand, promoting customized care pathways for patients, leveraging digital and human support

for patients, leveraging and support On the other hand, equipping primary care facilities in villages with oxygen, and bringing our expertise in coalitions to support local communities, expanding partnerships with NGOs

TRUST as the base to engage with our employees and to build a best-in-class governance

With safety as a prerequisite for action, the Group will engage with its employees to provide a common basis of CARE COVERAGE for 100% of its employees, as well as promote inclusion and diversity with a target to reach 35% of women among Managers & Professionals by 2025. We will thus continue to create a safe, inclusive and engaging workplace. Moreover, we will provide employees with the opportunity to devote time to a mission or a local project in line with the Group’s ESG objectives.

Regarding corporate governance, The Group, with a diverse and independent Board of Directors, will continue to implement best practices in terms of ethics, responsible dialogue and close relations with all shareholders.

The two companies are joining forces to transform the steel production process through the development of innovative solutions involving low-carbon hydrogen and CO2 capture technologies. This partnership is the first step towards the creation of a new low-carbon hydrogen and CO2 capture technologies ecosystem in this major industrial basin.

Air Liquide and ArcelorMittal have signed an MOU that aims to contribute significantly to the decarbonization of the Dunkirk industrial basin. In the context of the Paris Agreement, the European Commission’s Green Deal, and in line with Air Liquide and ArcelorMittal’s commitments to energy transition, the project will reduce yearly CO2 emissions from ArcelorMittal’s steel-making facilities in Dunkirk by 2.85 million tons by 2030. Air Liquide and ArcelorMittal have jointly applied for large projects funding under the Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI) scheme for hydrogen. Funding from European and/or French schemes supporting decarbonization is key for the implementation of the project.

ArcelorMittal is ready to implement an innovative production unit on its Dunkirk site, combining two steel production technologies – DRI: direct reduced iron unit, and submerged arc furnace – in dimensions never seen before. As a low-carbon technology, the DRI and submerged arc furnace unit will enable the production of steel with lower CO2 emissions. This initiative was the subject of a preliminary study announced by ArcelorMittal last October. It comes in addition to the initiatives already implemented by ArcelorMittal on its Dunkirk site to lower its CO2 emissions.

Air Liquide will support this strategic initiative through the massive supply of low-carbon hydrogen and the implementation of CO2 capture technologies in Dunkirk, one of Air Liquide's historical industrial basins in France. The Air Liquide group has developed a unique expertise both for hydrogen all along the value chain, from production and storage to distribution, as well as CO2 capture technologies. Leveraging this know-how and in line with its Climate objectives, Air Liquide is committed to develop sustainable solutions in supporting its customers in the steel industry to reduce carbon emissions.

This partnership between Air Liquide and ArcelorMittal is a first step towards the creation of an ecosystem at the forefront of low-carbon hydrogen and CO2 capture solutions that will be a source of competitiveness and attractiveness for various players in the Dunkirk industrial and port basin.
