"Air Liquide, Groupe PSA, Schneider Electric, Valeo rise to the challenge of producing 10000 Air Liquide Medical ... - Air Liquide","Tue, 31 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovL3d3dy5haXJsaXF1aWRlLmNvbS9ncm91cC9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy1uZXdzLzIwMjAtMDMtMzEvYWlyLWxpcXVpZGUtZ3JvdXBlLXBzYS1zY2huZWlkZXItZWxlY3RyaWMtdmFsZW8tcmlzZS1jaGFsbGVuZ2UtcHJvZHVjaW5nLTEwMDAwLWFpci1saXF1aWRlLW1lZGljYWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Faced with the compelling need for more respirators on its national territory, the French government has asked, on March 22, a group of French industrial companies led by Air Liquide to study the possibility of increasing the production of respirators so as to provide 10,000 respirators in 50 days, between the beginning of April and mid-May. In response, Air Liquide, Groupe PSA, Schneider Electric and Valeo have set up a Task Force composed of about 30 purchasing and industrialization experts in order to define an action plan to increase the production of Air Liquide Medical Systems respirators, which are already referenced by a great number of hospitals in France and abroad. To meet this industrial challenge, the exceptional contribution of 100 partner companies will also be sought so as to provide the 300 essential components that are necessary for the fabrication of these medical systems.

As a reminder, Air Liquide has already started the process of tripling its production capacities after the French Ministry of Health had confirmed mid-March a first order of 1,000 respirators to Air Liquide Medical Systems, a dedicated subsidiary of the Air Liquide Group. These intensive care respirators are already being produced by the teams located on the site in Antony, France, and two thirds of that order will be delivered to health facilities by the end of April.

Given the need to sharply increase the number of respirators in the context of the worsening Covid-19 situation and in order to fulfill the French government’s request, formulated by Agnès Pannier-Runacher, Minister of State, attached to the Minister of Economy and Finance, to supply a total of 10,000 respirators in 50 days, Air Liquide is coordinating a working group bringing together Groupe PSA, Schneider Electric and Valeo. This has resulted in a proposal to the Government on March 27 to supply two models of Air Liquide Medical Systems respirators, which will be delivered in six weeks.

This action leads to an exceptional mobilization and coordinated approach of the 4 major industrial Groups in order to secure the necessary components, the reorganisation of the production workshops and the involvement of the additional resources needed to assemble the elements that make up these respirators.

Securing the components - Close to 100 suppliers will provide the 300 components that make up these respirators. The purchasing experts of Air Liquide Medical Systems are working in pairs with the dedicated experts of the other partners in each field (mechanics and electronics) so as to secure the supply all along the implementation of the project. Reorganisation of the production workshops - The production rates of certain respirators will be multiplied by up to 70 thanks to the implementation of three additional lines, with three teams working six days a week. A pre-assembly of the mechanical part of the respirators will be executed on the site of Groupe PSA in Poissy, France. The last phase of the assembly, the control, the quality deliverance will be achieved on the Antony site, by the teams of Air Liquide Medical Systems. Involvement of additional resources - To complete the work carried out by Air Liquide teams, this intensive production program will also require the mobilization of 240 additional operators , out of which 185 in Antony and 55 operators from Groupe PSA based in Poissy.

As part of its commitment to solidarity alongside the healthcare professionals and the authorities, Air Liquide has committed to providing these respirators at cost price and without passing on the exceptional costs induced by the implementation of this unprecedented industrial program.

More than one hundred respirators per week will be delivered until mid-April, and then more than 1,000 per week.

The contribution of other companies is also under study and awaiting confirmation depending on the complementary needs that might be identified during project implementation."

Here's What Its Recent Performance Looks Like - Yahoo Finance,"Sun, 29 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnRlcmVzdGVkLWxhaXItbGlxdWlkZS1lcGEtYWktMDYwNzUwOTA2Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Examining L'Air Liquide S.A.'s (ENXTPA:AI) past track record of performance is an insightful exercise for investors. It allows us to reflect on whether or not the company has met or exceed expectations, which is a great indicator for future performance. Today I will assess AI's latest performance announced on 31 December 2019 and compare these figures to its longer term trend and industry movements.

View our latest analysis for L'Air Liquide S.A

Commentary On AI's Past Performance

AI's trailing twelve-month earnings (from 31 December 2019) of €2.2b has increased by 6.1% compared to the previous year.

However, this one-year growth rate has been lower than its average earnings growth rate over the past 5 years of 6.5%, indicating the rate at which AI is growing has slowed down. To understand what's happening, let's look at what's occurring with margins and whether the entire industry is feeling the heat.

ENXTPA:AI Income Statement March 29th 2020

In terms of returns from investment, L'Air Liquide S.A has fallen short of achieving a 20% return on equity (ROE), recording 12% instead. However, its return on assets (ROA) of 6.1% exceeds the FR Chemicals industry of 3.4%, indicating L'Air Liquide S.A has used its assets more efficiently. And finally, its return on capital (ROC), which also accounts for L'Air Liquide S.A’s debt level, has increased over the past 3 years from 7.5% to 9.7%.

What does this mean?

While past data is useful, it doesn’t tell the whole story. While L'Air Liquide S.A has a good historical track record with positive growth and profitability, there's no certainty that this will extrapolate into the future.

European Commission launches hydrogen initiative - Energy Reporters,"Wed, 11 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZXJneS1yZXBvcnRlcnMuY29tL3N0b3JhZ2UvZXVyb3BlYW4tY29tbWlzc2lvbi1sYXVuY2hlcy1oeWRyb2dlbi1pbml0aWF0aXZlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The European Commission has unveiled plans for an industrial strategy based on hydrogen production that include a “Clean Hydrogen Alliance” across the bloc.

“The alliance will build on existing work to identify technology needs, investment opportunities and regulatory barriers and enablers,” the European Union’s executive branch stated.

The initiative aims to promote the homegrown production of clean gases as the EU looks to become climate-neutral by 2050.

There are hopes that companies such as Air Liquide of France and Bosch of Germany will become involved.

The hydrogen alliance is intended to be modelled on the European Battery Alliance, which includes more than 200 firms, national governments and research bodies focussing on battery technology.

The initiative received €3.2 billion of state aid in December.

Hydrogen presents an alternative means to store surplus renewable energy.

European single-market commissioner Thierry Breton said hydrogen was potentially a crucial energy source for aviation and transport that emit large quantities of carbon each year.

Breton said hydrogen would become “strategically important for energy independence and the future of Europe”.

“Our job is to establish a vision,” the French commissioner said. “We need to provide a strategy because we need to give visibility for investment long term.

“Managing the green and digital transitions and avoiding external dependencies in a new geopolitical context requires radical change – and it needs to start now.”

The alliance plans to begin operations later this year, according to a Brussels representative.

Hydrogen is seen as a possible means to cut emissions from polluting industries producing steel, cement and chemicals.

Hydrogen can produce the temperatures above 1,000°C needed in industries like cement manufacture, steelmaking and oil refining.

More than two-thirds of the 70 million tonnes of hydrogen produced annually comes from natural gas.

The process creates approximately 830 million tonnes of carbon pollution annually, more than the combined emissions of the UK and Indonesia, the International Energy Agency reported.

Germany in February released a draft hydrogen strategy covering transport and storage with more details due to be released on March 18.

The CEO of the WindEurope lobby group, Giles Dickson, said: “It is good the commission has acknowledged the strategic role of renewables for the EU economy.

“Now is the time to take concrete measures. If the European Green Deal is to deliver climate neutrality by 2050, the EU needs to accelerate the deployment of wind energy.

“The commission sees wind being half of Europe’s electricity by 2050. And it’ll be a big part of the renewable hydrogen the EU wants more of.”

France's Air Liquide aims to boost production of ventilators - Yahoo Singapore News,"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vc2cubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vZnJhbmNlcy1haXItbGlxdWlkZS1haW1zLWJvb3N0LTE1MzY1ODE5My5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Air Liquide logos are displayed at the Alteo calcined alumina production plant in Gardanne

PARIS (Reuters) - The healthcare unit of French industrial gases company Air Liquide said on Tuesday it was ramping up production of ventilators needed by hospitals to deal with the coronavirus outbreak.

Ventilators, which are used to blow air and oxygen into the lungs, are critical for treating people with lung failure, which can afflict patients with severe COVID-19, the disease coronavirus causes.

""We've set up an additional assembly line,"" Air Liquide said in an emailed statement to Reuters, adding that workers were completely mobilized to produce the equipment.

The Air Liquide Medical Systems production site at Antony, just outside Paris, currently makes 500 ventilators that are used for resuscitation, and aims to ramp up monthly output to 1,100 in April, the company said.

Another site in Pau produces non-invasive ventilators, and plans to produce 600 units in April, compared with the present level of 200.

The group said it was also talking to the French government to see how other industrial companies might more broadly contribute to making breathing support equipment.

Shortages of ventilators across Europe are pushing states, including in Italy, to enlist help from the military and other manufacturers and even look at 3D printing to ramp up production.
