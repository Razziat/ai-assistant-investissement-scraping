Georges Claude and Neon Lights | OpenMind - BBVA OpenMind,"Fri, 17 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJidmFvcGVubWluZC5jb20vZW4vc2NpZW5jZS9sZWFkaW5nLWZpZ3VyZXMvZ2Vvcmdlcy1jbGF1ZGUtYW5kLW5lb24tbGlnaHRzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If Thomas Edison‘s light bulb is still an international symbol of innovation today —and the result of one of the greatest collective feats of humanity in the 19th century— in the history of technology we must also celebrate one of its heirs: neon lights. They were the result of combining the latest developments in chemistry and physics from the early 20th century, in an ingenious mix devised by Georges Claude (24 September 1870 – 23 May 1960), who is remembered today as “the French Edison.”

Just as the American inventor did not invent the light bulb, but turned it into a practical device and made its commercialisation viable, Claude did something similar with his neon lights, which he presented at the 1910 Paris Motor Show (held from 3 to 18 December), adorning the façade of the building with two enormous neon tubes, over 12 metres long, and a bright red light; this is how Georges Claude dazzled the crowds in the first public demonstration of his ingenuity, after having registered his patent in March of that same year.

His audacity provided an unexpected use for neon, an element that had been discovered only very recently. In 1898, William Ramsay and Morris Travers succeeded in separating pure neon gas from the air we breathe. While chemists were celebrating the fact that they could add the new element to the group of noble gases in the Periodic Table—under helium, right in the hole that Mendeleev had reserved for it—physicists began to study its properties using the typical gas discharge tubes of the time (into which they introduced gases at low pressure). Travers himself was the first to fall in love with neon light, which appeared in the tube upon applying an electric current of several thousand volts: “the blaze of crimson light from the tube told its own story and was a sight to dwell upon and never forget.”

From mere curiosity to useful gas

Neon lights were born, therefore, along with the discovery of this new noble gas. But for a while they were only used as mere curiosity —because neon was very rare, among other reasons— until Georges Claude entered this story. Claude had been experimenting with noble gases for some time and also founded a company to liquefy air in 1902 (Air Liquide, which today is one of the leading multinational gas producers). As a by-product of his method of liquefying air, Claude began producing tons and tons of neon gas, and also developed a method for purifying it once it was inside a sealed glass tube. His second invention was crucial and meant that neon lights could have an acceptable lifespan, as it managed to prevent the degradation of the electrodes that apply the current to the ends of the tube.

Claude’s patents described tubes up to 30 metres long, using conventional electrical installations, and also contemplated adding other gases such as helium, argon and mercury vapor to achieve all kinds of colours other than red neon. All the ingredients were there, but Claude’s second big business venture took some time to catch on. In the 1920s, he took his invention to the United States and, little by little, it began being used in advertisements, until eventually it became all the rage in the big cities. Over the following decades, neon lights changed the face of emblematic places such as Times Square in New York or Piccadilly Circus in London, even becoming a typical complement to art-deco architecture.

The decline and the reinvention

Its popularity declined in the second half of the 20th century in the Western world, but it continued to spread throughout the booming metropolises of Japan, Iran and Hong Kong. By then, fluorescent tubes (a close relative of neon lights) had begun to arrive in homes and offices, and much later the tubes were converted into tiny lights to illuminate plasma TVs. This new life reinforces the idea of neon lights as a great symbol of the innovation of the past century, now that the use of polluting materials and their high energy consumption have made them a relic of the past; where they still survive they are being replaced by LED tubes.

Claude did not live to see the decline and reinvention of his technological brainchild. He died in 1960, stripped of the honours he had accumulated by being “the Edison of France.” Accused of collaborationism during the Nazi occupation of his country, he was sentenced to life imprisonment at the end of World War II. He was in prison for 6 years and upon his release he was recognised for his final contribution to technological history: a pioneering pilot plant in Matanzas (Cuba) to extract clean energy from the sea, taking advantage of the difference in temperature between the surface and the bottom of the ocean.

LumApps raises $70M Series C led by Goldman Sachs - TechCrunch,"Tue, 21 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMC8wMS8yMS9sdW1hcHBzLXJhaXNlcy03MG0tc2VyaWVzLWMv0gFCaHR0cHM6Ly90ZWNoY3J1bmNoLmNvbS8yMDIwLzAxLzIxL2x1bWFwcHMtcmFpc2VzLTcwbS1zZXJpZXMtYy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LumApps, the cloud-based social intranet for the enterprise, has closed $70 million in Series C funding. Leading the round is Goldman Sachs Growth, with participation from Bpifrance via its Growth Fund Large Venture.

Others participating include Idinvest Partners, Iris Capital, and Famille C (the family office of Courtin-Clarins). The round brings the total raised by the French company to around $100 million.

Founded in Paris back in 2012, before launching today’s proposition in 2015, LumApps has developed what it describes as a “social intranet” for enterprises to enable employees to better informed, connect and collaborate. The SaaS integrates with other enterprise software such as G Suite, Microsoft Office 365 and Microsoft SharePoint, to centralize access to corporate content, business applications and social features under a single platform. The central premise is to help companies “break down silos” and streamline internal communication.

LumApps customers include Airbus, Veolia, Valeo, Air Liquide, Colgate-Palmolive, The Economist, Schibsted, EA, Logitech, Toto, and Japan Airlines, and the company claims to have achieved year-on-year revenue growth of 100%.

“Our dream was to enable access to useful information in one click, from one place and for everyone,” LumApps founder and CEO Sébastien Ricard told TechCrunch when the company raised its Series B early last year. “We wanted to build a solution that bridged [an] intranet and social network, with the latest new technologies. A place that users will love.”

Since then, LumApps has added several new offices and has seven worldwide: Lyon, Paris, London, New York, Austin, San Francisco, and Tokyo. Armed with additional funding, the company will continue adding significant headcount, hiring across engineering, product, sales and marketing. There are also plans to expand to Canada, more of Asia Pacific, and Germany.

“We’re actually looking at hiring 200 people minimum,” Ricard tells me. “We’re growing fast and have ambitious plans to take the product to new heights, including fulfilling our vision of making LumApps a personal assistant powered by AI. This will require a significant investment in top engineering/AI talent globally”.

Asked to elaborate on what machine learning and AI could bring to a social intranet, Ricard says the vision is to make LumApps a personal assistant for all communications and workflows in the enterprise.

“We see a future where this personal assistant can make predictive suggestions based on historical data and actions. Applying AI to prompt authors with suggested content, flagging important items that demand attention, and auto-archiving old content, are a few examples. Managing the massive troves of content and data companies have today is critical”.

Ricard also sees AI playing a big role in data security. “Employees have a high-degree of control with regard to data sharing and AI can help manage what employees can share in the workplace. This is more long-term but it’s where we’re headed,” he says.

“In the short-term, we’re making investments in automating as many workflows as possible with the goal of reducing or eliminating administrative tasks that keep employees from more productive tasks, including team collaboration and knowledge sharing”.

Meanwhile, LumApps says it may also use part of the Series C for M&A activity. “We’re growing fast and we’re looking at different areas for expansion opportunities,” Ricard says. “This includes retail and manufacturing and some business functions like HR, marketing and communications. We don’t have concrete plans to acquire any companies at the moment but we are keeping our options open as acquiring best-in-breed technologies often makes more sense from a business perspective than building it yourself”."
"BP's CFO to retire, succeeded by Murray Auchincloss - BIC Magazine","Tue, 21 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpY21hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9yZXNvdXJjZXMvcGVvcGxlLWdvaW5nLXBsYWNlcy9icCVFMiU4MCU5OXMtY2ZvLXRvLXJldGlyZS1zdWNjZWVkZWQtYnktbXVycmF5LWF1Y2hpbmNsb3NzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Expand MURRAY AUCHINCLOSS, CFO, BP

The board of BP p.l.c. today announced that Brian Gilvary, BP chief financial officer (CFO), has decided to retire from the company and step down from the BP board on 30 June 2020. Gilvary has had a 34-year career with BP, including over eight years as CFO.

He will be succeeded by Murray Auchincloss, currently CFO of BP’s Upstream segment, who will take up the role of BP CFO and join the board on 1 July 2020. Gilvary and Auchincloss will work together between now and the end of June to ensure an orderly transition.

BP chairman Helge Lund said: “We will miss Brian’s financial stewardship and strategic insights. He is one of the architects of today’s BP, key to its transformation into a safer, simpler and stronger company. After a thorough selection process, the board is pleased to have chosen Murray as BP’s next CFO. With his international financial and commercial experience and a deep understanding of the whole group, he will play an important role as BP continues to develop in a fast-changing energy market. On behalf of the board, I would like to thank Brian for all he has done for BP and look forward to welcoming Murray to the board.”

""All of us at BP will greatly miss Brian’s clarity of thought, his candour and his commitment to the company."" Bernard Looney, chief executive Upstream

Bob Dudley, BP group chief executive said: “I have worked closely with Brian for more than two decades and have always valued his financial expertise, strategic guidance and his unwavering dedication to the company. It is difficult to overstate the contribution he has made to BP: few CFOs have faced challenges of the scale that he has, and far fewer have managed them as successfully. As now we both approach retirement, I will miss working with him.”

Brian Gilvary said: “My career with BP has been a privilege, bringing opportunities and challenges that I could not have imagined when I first started out. But now is the right time to move on: BP is in good shape – strong and ready to face the future with new leadership. I am especially proud of the talented and diverse team of people we have built and all that we have achieved together – I’m certain BP will be in good hands.”

Bernard Looney, currently chief executive Upstream and BP group chief executive from 5 February 2020, said: “All of us at BP will greatly miss Brian’s clarity of thought, his candour and his commitment to the company. I appreciate that he has agreed to stay in post until mid-year to ensure a successful handover to Murray. I have worked side-by-side with Murray for many years and have the utmost confidence in his ability to step into this critical role.”

Gilvary joined BP in 1986 with a PhD in mathematics from the University of Manchester. After a variety of commercial and financial roles internationally in BP’s upstream, downstream and trading businesses, he became chief executive of BP ‘s integrated supply and trading function in 2005 and in 2010 deputy CFO and head of finance. He became BP CFO and joined the board in January 2012.

During his time as CFO he has managed some of the most complex issues to face BP: leading the rebuilding and strengthening of the group’s finances and the resolution of complex litigation after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill; managing the impacts of the oil price crash of 2014/15; and playing an integral role in evolving BP’s position in Russia.

Gilvary is a non-executive director of Air Liquide, the Royal Navy Board and the Francis Crick Institute. Recognised for his leadership in governance and finance issues, since 2018 he has chaired the 100 Group of FTSE 100 Finance Directors. A Great Britain Age Group Triathlete, he has been a strong advocate of BP’s support of the Paralympic movement.

Auchincloss has served as CFO for BP’s Upstream segment since 2015. He took up the role after two years as Upstream deputy CFO and head of business development for the segment. Before this he had been head of the group chief executive’s office from 2010-13, working directly with Bob Dudley.

Auchincloss first joined Amoco Canada in 1992 and his early career included financial and planning roles in Canada and the US. After a period as commercial director for BP’s Onshore North America business, from 2005-2007 he was CFO for BP’s North Sea business, including all Upstream activities in the UK and Norway. He has a degree in finance from the University of Calgary and also qualified as a Chartered Financial Analyst. He is the Deputy Director of the Aker BP board."
How many new trucks and vans are there in Europe? Over 180% increase in one country! - trans.info/en,"Thu, 30 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vdHJhbnMuaW5mby9lbi9ob3ctbWFueS1uZXctdHJ1Y2tzLWFuZC12YW5zLWFyZS10aGVyZS1pbi1ldXJvcGUtb3Zlci0xODAtaW5jcmVhc2UtaW4tb25lLWNvdW50cnktMTcxOTA40gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"2019 ended with a slight increase in the number of registered trucks in the EU. This was largely due to the weak results in December. The growth in the delivery van sector was slightly higher. In the last month of 2019 alone, their number increased by almost 9% in France, nearly 8% in the UK and 180.3% in Sweden!

The end of the year was not optimistic for the industry. In the last month, 9.4% fewer trucks over 3.5 t were registered in the European Union as a whole than during the same period of 2018. Even the main markets have given in to a negative trend – in Germany, the decrease in the number of new vehicles registered has exceeded 12%. In Italy, it was 11.7%, while in France – 10.5%.

The weak second half of the year affected the results for the whole of 2019. In total, 0.9% more vehicles were registered than in 2018. The key markets did quite well:

The United Kingdom +9.5%

Germany +4.2%

France +1.5%

Spain +1.1%

The only key market with declining demand was Italy (with a result of -7.6%), observes the European Truck Manufacturers’ Organisation ACEA, which collected the above data.

Fewer large vehicles

The situation was not much better in the segment of heavy trucks over 16 t. In this segment, the number of registrations in the EU increased only by 0.1% in the whole of 2019. While almost all key markets experienced growth, with the exception of the UK (+9.2%), these growths were small:

Spain +2.8%

France +2.1%

Germany +1.9%

Italy did not do well in this category either. There, the number of new vehicle registrations dropped by 7.7% y/y.

Again, this was greatly influenced by the weak December. Last month the growth in the number of new vehicles across the Community was 13.6% less than a year ago, “making it the sixth consecutive month of falling demand in 2019,” comments ACEA.

The main reason for this decline is the introduction of mandatory new (digital – note: Polish Automotive Industry Association) tachographs in heavy trucks from 15 June 2019,” adds ACEA.

This resulted in very large double-digit falls in most of the main markets. In Germany, the decline exceeded 20%. In the UK – 15%, while in France it reached almost 12%.

Swedish surprise

The situation is slightly better in the delivery truck segment. In the whole of 2019, almost 3% more vehicles were registered in the EU than in 2018, which means that 2.1 million new vehicles appeared on the roads.

All five key markets experienced growth, with Germany (+6.9%) and France (+4.5%) making a particularly strong contribution,” ACEA comments.

December ended with an increase in registrations of over 8% y/y. Of the key markets, France (+8.7%) and the UK (+7.8%) did best, while Germany (+1.6%) did the worst. The following countries reported declines: Spain (-8.2%) and again, Italy (-3.1%).

The exceptional performance in the Swedish van market (+180.3%) can be explained by the increase in the annual road tax for 2020,” adds the organisation."
The Hydrogen Council Announces Significant Membership Growth Covering New Geographies and Financial Sector ... - Hydrogen Council,"Wed, 15 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vaHlkcm9nZW5jb3VuY2lsLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdtZW1iZXJhbm5vdW5jZW1lbnQyMDIwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"New geographies represented, including Australia and the Middle East

New Investor Group established to connect investor community with industry in view of massive global scale-up of hydrogen solutions

Brussels, 15 January 2020 – The Hydrogen Council today announces a wave of new members to include for the first time both an Australian and Saudi company, as well as a group of financial institutions which form a new Investor Group with the aim of supporting massive scale-up of hydrogen solutions to help decarbonise sectors including transport, buildings and heavy industry. The Council today grows to 81 companies as it welcomes 22 new members, including five steering members: CNH Industrial (via IVECO), Michelin, Saudi Aramco (via the Aramco Overseas Company), Schaeffler Group, and Siemens; 12 supporting members: Chart Industries, Chevron, ElringKlinger, Fortescue Metals Group, Galp, ILJIN Composites, MANN+HUMMEL, McDermott, Nikola Motor, Sinocat, Snam, and Woodside Energy; and a new Investor Group of five companies that occupy the financial space: Antin Infrastructure Partners, BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole, John Laing, and Société Générale.

This membership announcement comes just days before the Council’s third anniversary CEO Event, to be held on 20 January in Versailles alongside French President Macron’s ChooseFrance! Summit and the World Economic Forum in Davos. This annual convening is the Hydrogen Council’s signature event that not only positions the global association as a business marketplace for the world’s top energy, mobility, and financial companies, but also provides a time for all members to assess the state of the industry and develop strategies that will lay the path ahead for the fast emerging hydrogen economy.

“We are very pleased to see continued interest from world-renowned companies who recognize the massive potential of hydrogen and share our mission of scaling up hydrogen solutions,” said Benoit Potier, Chairman and CEO of Air Liquide and Co-chair of the Hydrogen Council. “In the past three years the Hydrogen Council has boosted global collaboration and the industry is firmly positioned to scale up hydrogen solutions around the world. Increased support from new countries and investors is a testament of the strong momentum we have built. It is through this continued collaboration and the scaling up of hydrogen solutions that we will achieve the environmental and economic benefits toward a low carbon society.”

The Hydrogen Council is a CEO-led global initiative of leading energy, transport and industry companies with a united vision and long-term ambition for hydrogen to foster the energy transition. The addition of the Council’s newest members is the culmination of a year of strong progress in 2019. Across the last year, the Council engaged ministers at the Hydrogen Energy Ministerial and several other forums, established partnerships with international organisations such as IEA Hydrogen and the European Investment Bank, and hosted industry leaders as well as members of the investment community during its Investor Day at the G20 Summit. And now, the launch of the Investor Group is another step in defining and implementing specific action plans with appropriate supporting tools that will help accelerate major investment into large-scale commercialisation of hydrogen solutions across industries world-wide. It is expected that by 2050, hydrogen could meet 18% of the world’s energy demand with hydrogen applications being scaled, driving down cost, and making the solutions more affordable for everyday people.

“We believe in the power of hydrogen and the role it can play in our existing energy system as well as a new cleaner one,” said Euisun Chung, Executive Vice Chairman of Hyundai Motor Group and Co-chair of the Hydrogen Council. “I continue to be inspired by the expansion of the Council’s membership and look forward to partnering with our new member companies as we continue to advocate for a clean energy future, with hydrogen at the forefront.”

Today’s membership growth brings the Hydrogen Council to a total of 81 companies that represent the full hydrogen supply chain and several regions of the world with expanding hydrogen markets. The coalition has more than quadrupled in size since its founding in 2017 by 13 members.



About the Hydrogen Council: The Hydrogen Council is a CEO-led organisation that uses its global reach to promote collaboration between governments, industry and investors, and to provide guidance on accelerating the deployment of hydrogen solutions around the world. The Council acts as a business marketplace, building a comprehensive hydrogen economy and shifting the perception of hydrogen globally. In addition, the Hydrogen Council serves as a resource for safety standards and an interlocutor for the investment community, while identifying opportunities for regulatory advocacy in key geographies. The coalition of 81 members including large multinationals, innovative SMEs and investors collectively represents total revenues of over €18.7 trillion and close to 6 million jobs around the world.

Cameroon reconnects to WACS and SAT3 submarine cables - Business in Cameroon,"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5jYW1lcm9vbi5jb20vZWNvbm9teS8yNzAxLTk4OTgtY2FtZXJvb24tcmVjb25uZWN0cy10by13YWNzLWFuZC1zYXQzLXN1Ym1hcmluZS1jYWJsZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Business in Cameroon) - More than a week after the rupture of the WACS and SAT3 submarine cables off the coast of Cameroon, which had disrupted Internet access in several Central African countries, the mobile operator Orange Cameroon announces the resumption of its services.

“Dear customers, the re-establishment of the submarine connection cable is effective. All your services are now available,” the operator wrote in a French message sent to its users on January 24, 2020.

As a reminder, at Orange Cameroon, the rupture of the two submarine optical fibre cables had notably disrupted the operator's Internet and Orange Money services. At MTN, which is part of the consortium that deployed WACS in Cameroon (before being forced to resell the infrastructure by the Cameroonian state, editor's note), the disruptions were more serious.

To alleviate this problem, MTN Cameroon announced on January 20, 2020, that it had managed to connect to an “alternative submarine cable” as an emergency response, with the help of its local and international partners.

This 3D seismic acquisition is a geophysical method of observation that provides a 3D image of 1,000 km2 surface for depths of less than 10 km.

The successful bidder will be responsible for getting to know the area of interest and developing the cartographic, photographic and illustrative material required to support the observations and recommendations made in the field. In addition, it will have to evaluate the cost of the planned seismic campaign by detailing it with headings (topography, drilling, seismic device, mobilization, demobilization, and layout), suggesting possible options for the acceptable optimization of costs and deadlines.

The maximum time frame envisaged by the SNH for the completion of the feasibility study is four months.

In order to ensure that bidders understand all the contours of the mission and the context in which it is involved, the SNH is organizing a meeting with the companies that have acquired the tender documents on Monday, February 17, 2020. This meeting will be followed by a visit, scheduled to last four days from the day following the preparatory meeting, to the site where the services will be carried out.

Each bid, written in French or English and in seven copies, including one original and six copies marked as such, must be sent to the secretariat of the SNH’s contracting unit, under sealed cover, no later than March 6, 2020.

Under penalty of rejection of the bid, each bidder must attach to its administrative documents, a bid bond of XAF3 million, issued by a financial organization authorized by the Minister of Finance to issue bonds in connection with public procurement contracts, or the equivalent sum in US dollars or €4,574 issued by a first-class banking institution (only for foreign bidders). Bids will be opened on March 6, 2020, in Yaoundé.
