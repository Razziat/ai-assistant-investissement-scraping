Tag: Ntui - Business in Cameroon,"Thu, 23 Aug 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5jYW1lcm9vbi5jb20vdGFncy9udHVp0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It’s a real ordeal for the populations of Ntui, a rich agricultural locality situated in the Central region of Cameroon. To transport their farm products to the cities, they have to cross the Sanaga River by ferry. The same applies to the cattle, which are also transported by ferry or by boat. An average of CFAF 5,000 per head is paid to carry them across by boat. In addition, the ferry-boarding fee has to be paid and this contributes to increasing the price of foodstuffs, according to farmers.

Worse still, when the ferry breaks down, the food rots and patients die in villages because they have no means of being evacuated to Yaoundé, the capital. Cocoa producers are deducted 10 CFAF per kilogramme of cocoa sold to touts (buyers). This amount is said to cushion extra costs generated by the breakdown of the ferry, which lengthens transportation to Yaoundé. The same situation was experienced very recently in March 2012 when the populations of Ntui spent seven months without a ferry due to its breakdown. “7 months with no ferry on the Sanaga, a disaster for the Mbam and Kim economy”, was the title of an article wrote at that time by the paper ‘La Voix du Paysan’, which sounded the alarm.

When the ferry is operational, one boards it almost trembling with fear. In November 2010 for example, the ferry which connects Nachtigal village to the city of Ntui, with close to 200 passengers and seven vehicles on board diverted 10 km away from the landing point, near Ntui.

Fortunately, there were no human casualties.

Long wait

Actually, Ntui is linked to Yaoundé, the capital, by three exits. However, the shortest and most used exit goes via Obala. It covers about 80 km. Travelling through this exit, one has to necessarily cross River Sanaga by ferry. The river is situated 12 km from the city of Ntui. According to ‘La Voix du paysan’, it is also the shortcut for cattle transported from the ‘Grand Nord’ of Cameroon.

The populations have been expecting the construction of the bridge on this route for over three decades. Mr Ayissi introduced as head of Ehongo village near River Sanaga said he was disgusted to talk about this problem. A retired civil servant, he told ‘La voix du Paysan’ that he cannot go to Yaoundé with his car anymore because the trip will be too expensive. “When will there be a final solution to this problem? Is it forbidden to build us a bridge like that of Ebebda?” he wondered.

In response, officials of the Ministry of the Economy, Planning and Territorial Development say that the technical studies for the construction of the bridge over the Sanaga in Natchigal have been available since September 2010.

It involves building a 850 m bridge over River Sanaga in Natchigal which links the localities of Batchenga and Ntui. The overall cost of the project is estimated at CFAF 24 billion (€ 40 million).

Financing which still needs to be sought. It is a project which can be delivered within three years and the Cameroonian government would like the bridge to be operational in 2015. MC"
Le Livret A rapporte autant que la moitié du CAC 40 - Le Figaro,"Wed, 22 Aug 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vYm91cnNlLmxlZmlnYXJvLmZyL2luZGljZXMtYWN0aW9ucy9hY3R1LWNvbnNlaWxzL2xlLWxpdnJldC1hLXJhcHBvcnRlLWF1dGFudC1xdWUtbGEtbW9pdGllLWR1LWNhYy00MC0yNjU4ODLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Le relèvement du plafond du Livret A à 19.000 euros constitue une incitation forte à se détourner des actions au profit des produits défiscalisés. Un problème pour le financement des entreprises.

La décision du gouvernement Ayrault de relever immédiatement de 25 % le plafond du Livret A à 19.000 euros risque de détourner encore un peu plus les Français de la Bourse. Le taux de 2,25 % net d'impôts actuellement offert par le Livret A rapporte en effet plus que les emprunts d'États à 10 ans dont le rendement n'excède pas 2,15 %. Il concurrence surtout directement la moitié des valeurs du CAC 40 qui,déduction faite des impôts perçus sur les dividendes, rapportent moins que le Livret A.

En tenant compte du prélèvement forfaitaire libératoire de 36,5 % sur les dividendes, le placement fétiche des Français entre en effet directement en concurrence avec tous les titres qui rapportent moins de 3,1%. Parmi ceux-ci figurent des valeurs comme Alstom, PPR, Danone, Safran, Air Liquide, Accor, LVMH, L'Oréal Publicis et Pernod Ricard. A réalité, avec un rendement moyen de 4,1 % pour l'ensemble des sociétés du CAC 40, cette mesure constitue une incitation forte à sortir du marché des actions considéré comme risqué, trop imposés et finalement peu rémunérateur.

Les sommes qui vont venir se substituer aux placements en actions ne sont pas négligeables, puisqu'une famille avec deux enfants peut désormais placer 76.000 euros sur un Livret A. Avec un Livret de développement durable (LDD) porté à 7500 euros, c'est 83.500 euros qui pourraient être placés en toute sécurité et sans impôt.

Ce détournement de l'épargne de l'économie productive et créatrice d'emplois vers des placements administrés pourrait rapidement devenir un sujet de préoccupation majeur dans notre pays. A l'heure où nos entreprises ont besoin de fonds propres, l'ex-ministre du Budget, Valérie Pécresse, n'a pas tardé à fustiger le relèvement du plafond du Livret A annoncé par le Premier ministre: une ""mesure anti-entreprises"" et un retour à ""la gauche archaïque""!

Wind Energy Systems Comes To Walmart Distribution Center - Hydrogen News - Green Hydrogen Report,"Sun, 12 Aug 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmh5ZHJvZ2VuZnVlbG5ld3MuY29tL3dpbmQtZW5lcmd5LXN5c3RlbXMtY29tZXMtdG8td2FsbWFydC1kaXN0cmlidXRpb24tY2VudGVyLzg1NTE2Ny_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Walmart reveals its first on-site wind energy system

Retail giant Walmart has unveiled its first on-site wind energy project. The project will find a home the retailer’s Red Bluff, California, distribution center. The project is embodied by a single wind turbine, which boasts of a height of 265 feet. The wind turbine is manufactured by General Electric and will be able to provide a great deal of electrical power to the distribution center. This is the first time Walmart has embarked on an on-site wind energy project, but the retailer has shown support for various forms of alternative energy.

Wind energy system to produce 2 million kWh per year

Based on information provided by General Electric, Walmart expects the new wind turbine to produce approximately 2 million-kilowatt hours of electricity annually. Foundation Windpower, a developer of on-site wind energy systems, will be responsible for the installation of the wind turbine as well as its management. As part of an agreement between the company and Walmart, Foundation Windpower will retain ownership of the turbine for the time being while Walmart makes use of the energy it generates.

New on-site turbine could help cut energy costs

The new wind energy system is expected to save the retailer a significant amount of money by cutting back on the fossil-fuels used at its Red Bluff distribution center. Fuel costs have been growing in the U.S., as have the costs of transporting this fuel from one location to another. On-site energy systems are beginning to grow in popularity in various industrial of business because of their economic potential. Walmart believes that wind energy, in particular, could hold a great deal of economic promise.

Wind energy relatively uncommon in the retail industry

Wind energy has received attention from several governments around the world, but relatively few businesses have opted to make use of the power. Many large companies are opting to use solar energy systems as a way to reduce their environmental impact and save money on energy. Industrial companies have shown favor for hydrogen fuel cells.
