"Air Liquide, TotalEnergies, VINCI and a group of international companies launch the world's largest clean hydrogen ... - Air Liquide","Fri, 01 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5haXJsaXF1aWRlLmNvbS9ncm91cC9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy1uZXdzLzIwMjEtMTAtMDEvYWlyLWxpcXVpZGUtdG90YWxlbmVyZ2llcy12aW5jaS1hbmQtZ3JvdXAtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1jb21wYW5pZXMtbGF1bmNoLXdvcmxkcy1sYXJnZXN0LWNsZWFu0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide, TotalEnergies and VINCI, are combining forces with other large international companies to sponsor the creation of the world’s largest fund exclusively dedicated to clean hydrogen infrastructure solutions. The fund aims to reach 1.5 billion euros and has already secured initial commitments of 800 million euros. Its objective is to accelerate the growth of the clean hydrogen ecosystem by investing in large strategic projects and leveraging the alliance of industrial and financial players.

The clean hydrogen infrastructure fund will invest in the entire value chain of renewable and low carbon hydrogen, in the most promising regions in the Americas, Asia and Europe. It will invest as a partner, alongside other key project developers and/or industry players, in large upstream and downstream clean hydrogen projects. Total commitments to the fund have already reached 800 million euros out of a target of around 1.5 billion euros at signature.

Air Liquide, TotalEnergies and VINCI Concessions have been at the forefront of setting up and aggregating commitments to this clean hydrogen infrastructure fund. As anchor partners, fully committed to low carbon and renewable hydrogen development, each has pledged to invest 100 million euros. The fund will be managed by Hy24[1], a brand new 50/50 joint venture between Ardian, a world-leading private investment house and FiveT Hydrogen, a clean hydrogen enabling investment platform. The choice of this fund manager allows to merge with their similar initiative and to add Plug Power as an anchor partner, as well as Chart Industries and Baker Hughes joining together.

LOTTE Chemical has also confirmed its intention to participate as anchor investor, and is the first Asian company to join. The fund expects to attract further investments from large financial players, with AXA as anchor investor. Large international industrial players from North America and Europe, which are strongly committed to carbon neutrality, also intend to join the initiative as non-anchor partners, such as Groupe ADP, Ballard, EDF, and Schaeffler.

With solid industrial expertise and significant investment potential, the clean hydrogen infrastructure fund will have a unique capacity to unlock large scale projects under development and accelerate the scaling up of hydrogen markets. With the announced support of public policies and some use of debt financing, the fund should be able to contribute to the development of hydrogen projects with a total value of about 15 billion euros.

As a pioneer in hydrogen for over 50 years, Air Liquide is convinced that hydrogen is a cornerstone of the energy transition. The Group is providing its unique expertise along the entire value chain, using hydrogen as a clean energy carrier for industrial processes and clean mobility. Benoît Potier, Chairman and CEO of Air Liquide, declared:

“Hydrogen has become a central element of the energy transition. The time to act is now, not only as companies on a stand-alone basis, but by joining forces with states, other industrial groups and the financial community. With the creation of this fund, we are demonstrating our leadership to participate in a collective dynamic to build momentum. As Air Liquide, we have already committed to invest approximately 8 billion euros in the low-carbon hydrogen supply chain by 2035. Our objective is to contribute to the development of the entire value chain from low-carbon hydrogen production to end-uses, investing in the necessary infrastructure with storage and distribution projects. Accelerating on Hydrogen development is key to mitigate climate change.”

As a broad energy Company, TotalEnergies’ ambition is to get to net-zero emissions by 2050 together with society for its global business across its production and energy products used by its customers. Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies, commented:

“We believe that clean, renewable hydrogen will play a key role in the energy transition, and TotalEnergies wants to be a pioneer in its mass production. We are currently working on several projects, notably to decarbonize the grey hydrogen used in our European refineries by 2030. We are convinced that a collective effort is needed to kick-start the hydrogen sector and take it to scale. We are thus proud to launch and invest in the Clean hydrogen infrastructure fund, which will also give us privileged insights in the sector.”

A global player in concessions, construction and energy, present in some 100 countries, VINCI is actively committed to Net Zero Emission by implementing an ambitious environmental policy. Its mission is to design, finance, build and operate infrastructure and facilities that contribute to improving daily life and mobility for everyone. Xavier Huillard, Chairman and CEO of VINCI, declared:

“VINCI is taking concrete action to support the development of clean energy by mobilising all its divisions in concessions, construction and energy, with the aim of actively combating climate change and decarbonising mobility in particular. By launching this investment fund today, hand in hand with other major industrial leaders, we keep moving forward to make green hydrogen a strong lever in achieving our objectives”.

The hydrogen economy is expected to be key in the fight against climate change. Many countries have initiated hydrogen-related regulations and support schemes to enable clean hydrogen to help decarbonize their economies. Hydrogen offers a solution to decarbonize industrial processes and the mobility sector.

Subject to Hy24’s French Market Authority (AMF) accreditation as an Alternative Investment Fund Manager (AIFM), the platform will be operational in late 2021 and first closing is expected before the end of the year."
Clariant & Air Liquide present MegaZonE™: Novel catalyst layering technology for enhanced methanol synthesis ... - Clariant,"Wed, 27 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbGFyaWFudC5jb20vZW4vQ29ycG9yYXRlL05ld3MvMjAyMS8xMC9DbGFyaWFudC1hbXAtQWlyLUxpcXVpZGUtcHJlc2VudC1NZWdhWm9uRXRyYWRlLU5vdmVsLWNhdGFseXN0LWxheWVyaW5nLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktZm9yLWVuaGFuY2VkLW1ldGhh0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"New technology allows up to 15% higher cumulative methanol production

The layering of catalysts with different activity levels increases productivity and catalyst lifetime

MegaZonE technology successfully applied for two methanol plants in Asia

Munich, October 27, 2021 – Clariant’s long-term partnership with Air Liquide Engineering & Construction has resulted in another major breakthrough in methanol synthesis: the MegaZonE technology. Based on Clariant’s MegaMax® catalyst series, this innovative method uses several layers of catalysts with different activity levels to optimize heat management and overall catalyst performance in the methanol synthesis reactor. Furthermore, the properties of each catalyst layer are tailored to the specific conditions along the reaction pathway, which results in a significantly longer catalyst lifetime (by up to 2 years) and an increased cumulative methanol production (up to 15%), thus potentially leading to monetary benefits of up to several million US dollars. With this performance outlook, MegaZonE was successfully applied to two world-scale methanol plants in Asia this year, showing already excellent and stable performance.

Stefan Heuser, Senior Vice President and General Manager at Clariant Catalysts, commented, “MegaZonE is a game-changer for both current and future methanol producers as it allows more compact and resilient designs, ultimately resulting in increased profits for our customers. It is another example of the close cooperation between our innovative catalyst R&D team and our long-standing engineering partner Air Liquide Engineering and Construction.”

MegaZonE enables increased efficiency of the methanol synthesis loop, thus, the loop can be operated at milder conditions. Catalysts with moderate activity are loaded in hotter zones of the converter to prevent hotspots, while activity-enhanced catalysts are placed further down the reaction pathway to intensify reaction rates in the lower portion of the converter. On the one hand, less thermal stress on catalysts will lead to longer catalyst lifetimes. On the other hand, high activity in the bottom part of the reactor will increase reaction rates and reduce by-product formation by up to 10%. MegaZonE technology is a drop-in solution and enables tailored refill options for process optimizations of existing units. It also allows a more compact and resilient design for new plants.

Moreover, the possibility to use different feed sources, such as stranded gas, unused syngas, or CO2-rich gases, can drastically reduce the CO2 footprint of methanol producers, making MegaZonE also a highly sustainable solution.

Hy24 founded for H2 infrastructure investment - www.electrive.com,"Mon, 04 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsZWN0cml2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8xMC8wNC9oeTI0LWZvdW5kZWQtZm9yLWgyLWluZnJhc3RydWN0dXJlLWludmVzdG1lbnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ardian and FiveT Hydrogen have announced the beginning of Hy24, “the world’s largest investment platform focused exclusively on clean hydrogen infrastructure”. Hy24’s first fund is expected to have a volume of 1.5 billion euros.

The investment platform is being set up by Ardian and FiveT Hydrogen as a joint venture. According to a statement by the partners, “leading industrial and financial investors” have already committed funds of 800 million euros. This is more than half of the 1.5 billion euros targeted for the first fund. The industrial gas producer Air Liquide, the mineral oil company TotalEnergies and the construction company Vinci have all pledged their participation. All three French companies want to contribute 100 million euros each. Hy24 is the result of an initiative started by industrial champions: Air Liquide, TotalEnergies, VINCI Concessions, Plug Power, Baker Hughes and Chart Industries and joined by AXA.

Plug Power, Chart Industries Baker Hughes, Lotte Chemical and Axa are also named as investors, and Groupe ADP, Ballard, EDF and Schaeffler also want to join Hy24, with more names to be announced shortly. Hy24 aims to bring together more international institutional investors and industrial companies to “create investment opportunities for hydrogen projects around the world”. The organisation says its aim is to accelerate the growth of the clean hydrogen ecosystem by investing in large strategic projects and leveraging the alliance of industry and financial players.

Hy24’s first fund will be launched under Article 9 of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) as a so-called impact fund with the goal of global CO2 reduction. The partners say their cooperation will extend proven technologies to mature infrastructure assets and offer investors access to a new asset class that has the potential to reach the same growth rate as other renewable energy sources.

The organisation has an international outlook, saying that the portfolio will be diversified across different regions – Europe, America and Asia – and value chains, from upstream projects such as the production of green hydrogen to downstream projects such as self-consumption fleets and refuelling stations. The partners point out the value creation opportunities in job creation and in the decarbonisation of ‘difficult-to-decarbonise’ sectors, which are generally known to be long-haul and heavy-duty transport, including shipping and aviation along with numerous industrial applications such as the production of steel, among other areas.

Joint venture partner Ardian is a private investment firm that focuses on investing in infrastructure. FiveT Hydrogen is an existing clean hydrogen investment platform that is expected to bring to the joint venture its existing experience and access to the hydrogen value chain.

According to Mathias Burghardt, head of Ardian Infrastructure, says: “At a time when the European Union has announced a step-up in its climate ambitions, and just ahead of COP26, it is a great responsibility to lead such a platform. We were early backers of the renewables market, our platform reaching 7.5GW of heat and renewable capacity today, and it is clear to us that hydrogen is facing a similar trajectory.”

Pierre-Etienne Franc, co-founder and CEO of FiveT Hydrogen revealed that the partners expect to mobilise 15 billion euros of investment through the partnership, which they expect will serve as a catalyst for the rapid expansion of the industry. He explained that the creation of the platform responds to the huge demand from governments, businesses and investors to invest in hydrogen to meet the world’s climate goals.

Indeed, there has been an explosion of activity in hydrogen activity and hydrogen strategies and corresponding transport initiatives have already been initiated in the EU as well as many European states as well as the UK, the US and China.

Hydrogen vehicles are also now being made by most of the world’s largest vehicle manufacturers in the vehicle size from delivery vans to heavy-duty vehicles as well as shipping and aviation. One of the first movers in fuel cell vehicles has been Hyundai, other first-movers that must also be mentioned are Hyzon Motors, and Hy24 member Ballard. In H2 aviation Airbus is making solid headway with hydrogen aircraft and infrastructure also collaboration with Hy24 members Air Liquide and Vinci.

In the current step for Hy24, a recruitment process is currently underway to establish a dedicated global team that is to operate across four countries: France, Switzerland, the US and Singapore.

Other goals include testing and evaluating the hardware's performance and standardizing the connector design to ensure adoptability throughout the world. This builds upon the collaboration of the hydrogen industry that achieved a global standard fueling interface for light-duty fuel cell electric vehicles.

Tatsuno, an international hydrogen fuel equipment provider founded in 1911, is designing and developing vehicle receptacle and dispenser nozzle and breakaway components, whereas Transfer Oil, considered one of the most valued manufacturers of reinforced thermoplastic hoses in the industry, is leading the design and development of a hydrogen dispenser fueling hose. The fueling hardware is anticipated to support average hydrogen fueling rates of 10kg/min which is in line with the US Department of Energy's Technical Targets for Hydrogen-Fueled Long-Haul Tractor-Trailer Trucks. Testing is planned at an independent test facility and scheduled to commence in Q4 2021, with preliminary performance and safety results available in Q1 2022.

""This innovative fueling technology will be an essential part of our hydrogen infrastructure development strategy, making hydrogen available to Nikola heavy-duty FCEV customers and the industry at large,"" said Nikola President, Energy and Commercial Pablo Koziner.

""Together with other industry players, Nikola is pushing the development and introduction of the new H70HF standard. The development of this hardware is an integral part to enable projected fueling times competitive to diesel fueling times,"" stated Christian Appel, Nikola Global Chief Engineer Tre FCEV and Propulsion Engineering.

""This effort is a prime example of industry competitors working together towards a common goal of decarbonization. Toyota is proud to be a member of this group and of the vision we share for a future where diesel trucks are replaced with zero emission hydrogen fuel cell electric technology,"" said Justin Ward, Group Manager of Toyota's Fuel Cell Development Department.

""On March 23, Air Liquide announced its ambitious ESG objectives to ACT for a sustainable future. In full support of the 2015 Paris agreement, our commitments address the urgency of climate change and the energy transition, targeting carbon neutrality by 2050. The plan includes an acceleration in hydrogen development, something Air Liquide has been involved in for some time. Over the past 50 years, Air Liquide has developed a unique expertise, mastering the entire supply chain, from production and storage to distribution. As such, Air Liquide is contributing to the widespread use of hydrogen as a clean energy carrier for a wide range of applications such as industrial usages and clean mobility,"" said Andrew Garnett, Vice President, Hydrogen.

Hyundai Motor Company announced its carbon neutral commitment to reduce its carbon emissions 75 percent below the 2019 level by 2040, and to achieve carbon neutrality in its products and global operations by 2045. The company's integrated strategy to achieve carbon neutrality rests on the following three pillars: clean mobility, next-generation, and green energy. By 2030, the company aims to secure 30 percent of its global vehicle shares with ZEVs, and by 2040, it expects BEVs and FCEVs to account for 80% of its total fleet sales.

The vision for Hyundai Motor Group is that by 2040 hydrogen energy will be used not only for transportation but will also be applied to wider areas of industries and sectors. Hyundai Motor Group aims to make hydrogen energy available to 'Everyone, Everything and Everywhere'. They plan to proactively respond to climate change through hydrogen solutions, starting with the commercial vehicle sector, which emits larger amounts of CO2 and requires longer drive ranges compared with the passenger vehicle sector. Hyundai Motor Group will launch all-new commercial vehicles such as buses and heavy-duty trucks for the global market as fuel cell electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles. By 2028, they expect to become the first global automaker to apply its fuel cell system to all commercial vehicle models.

NextEnergy, a nonprofit technology accelerator based in Detroit, is the project manager and will oversee the successful completion of this initiative.

Van Hool — manufacturer of buses, coaches and industrial vehicles — builds each year an average of about 1,400 buses and coaches in Koningshooikt (Belgium) and Skopje (North Macedonia). The company also produces 3,000 industrial vehicles, such as semi-trailers and tankers. In 2005, Van Hool decided to focus on hydrogen, with Van Hool now European market leader for hydrogen-powered buses.

Sander Sijssens, Senior Project Engineer Energy Transport Systems at Van Hool.

We’ve had faith in hydrogen for a long time, partly because we came across it very early on, through customers in California.

“The hydrogen drive was initially supplied by an American developer, but we soon realised that we could do it ourselves. Shortly after that, we built the first truly Van Hool hydrogen bus, along with such partners as Air Liquide and Siemens.”

3Emotion

In 2015, Van Hool committed to 3Emotion, a European initiative to encourage hydrogen bus development. In conjunction with the other members of the consortium, including Air Liquide, Van Hool is constructing 12 hydrogen buses to be used in cities such as London, Rotterdam, Pau, Versailles and Aalborg.

In addition to the 12 buses for the 3Emotion project, Van Hool has so far built more than 130 hydrogen-powered buses for similar projects all over Europe. The biggest customer is the German RVK – Regional Verkehr Köln – which has no fewer than 37 hydrogen buses in use.

“We’re expecting a big growth in demand for hydrogen buses in the next few years. We’re already delivering around 100 hydrogen-powered buses a year but, if necessary, we can bring in extra production lines to increase that number even further.”

A real alternative to diesel

Sander Sijssens is pleased with the feedback from Van Hool’s hydrogen bus customers: “Most of them are enthusiastic about the reliability and performance of the buses. In particular, the driving behaviour, the range, the fuel consumption and their wide deployability are often mentioned as strong points. Our customers are in complete agreement that hydrogen is a real alternative to diesel.”

“Hydrogen buses are suited to longer distances because it’s possible to fill up quickly with large quantities of hydrogen, which can then be used for a whole day’s driving. Often several days even. We usually guarantee a range of 350 km, but in practice it’s often a lot more.”

Electric or hydrogen?

“With electric buses it’s a bit more difficult,” Sander continues. “That’s because the charging times are a lot longer, which brings with it some limitations and practical issues. Fast charging partly solves these problems, but then again it has a negative impact on the life of the components.”

“If you want to be able to provide the same services with electric buses, you need more buses than if you opt for hydrogen. And your electricity infrastructure also has to be able to cope with the extra load. On the other hand, buses used to transport employees to and from work, for example, usually need only a limited range. In which case you don’t need to use a hydrogen bus.”

More hydrogen stations

“Because it’s now clear that the number of hydrogen-powered buses will increase sharply in the near future, it’s important we adapt the distribution and supply of hydrogen stations accordingly, as well as the capacity of each individual station.

Even at peak times – trucks often fill up in the morning and many private individuals like to fill up just before the weekend – it has to be possible to refuel without annoying waiting times. We’re also working hard, partly in collaboration with Air Liquide engineers, to optimise the communication protocols for refuelling.”

When a bus, or any other vehicle, refuels with hydrogen, information must be continuously exchanged between the refuelling station and the vehicle. This allows the vehicle to refuel quickly, efficiently and safely at the right pressure and temperature.

Many hydrogen cars use an infrared communication system that is gradually becoming standard. Such an approach is also starting to become more common in the heavy goods vehicle sector.

This is why Van Hool has developed an infrared communication system with which

buses and other heavy vehicles can communicate with hydrogen stations. The new system has been extensively tested, and approved, at the Air Liquide hydrogen station in Zaventem.

Prospects for the future

“We’re working hard on a new platform for hydrogen-powered buses that will soon offer greater range and lower consumption. The buses will also be able to carry more passengers and have a longer service life. More importantly, the TCO will also drop significantly. In any event, we must all ensure that in the long run hydrogen buses will be no more expensive than diesel buses.”

The plan to acquire the ASUs was first announced on July 29 last year, subject to approvals. Engineering News previously reported in May that the Competition Commission had recommended that the Competition Tribunal approve the acquisitions with public interest conditions attached, thereby enabling the deal to go ahead.

In a statement issued in May, the commission said the proposed transaction was “unlikely to result in a substantial prevention or lessening of competition in any relevant markets”.

The initial investment amounts to about R8-billion and comprises 16 ASUs that will now be operated by Air Liquide Large Industries South Africa Air. It is the largest oxygen production site globally, boasting a total installed capacity of 42 000 t/d.

The company will carry out a plan to reduce its carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions by between 30% and 40% within the next ten years. As part of the operation, Air Liquide has added more than 220 employees to its ranks who will continue to operate the ASUs. These employees join the existing Air Liquide team in Secunda, where the company has been operating a seventeenth ASU for Sasol since 2018 with a total production capacity of 5 000 t/d.

Air Liquide will bring to the site its global expertise in implementing highly mastered operational practices, state-of-the-art technologies, modernisation investments and digital capabilities to optimise the operation of the ASUs and their energy consumption."
