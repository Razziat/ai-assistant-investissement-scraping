Airgas Teamsters Begin Strikes in Four California Locations - International Brotherhood of Teamsters,"Tue, 08 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vdGVhbXN0ZXIub3JnLzIwMTkvMTAvYWlyZ2FzLXRlYW1zdGVycy1iZWdpbi1zdHJpa2VzLWZvdXItY2FsaWZvcm5pYS1sb2NhdGlvbnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(BURBANK, LYNWOOD, POMONA & VENTURA, Calif.) – Truck drivers, gas cylinder fillers, loaders and dispatchers who are members of Teamsters Local 848 went on strike this morning at four Airgas USA locations in California, due to the company’s numerous violations of federal laws that protect workers’ rights.

The striking Airgas employees are members of Teamsters Local 848. They supply gas to many California facilities and businesses such as hospitals, nursing homes and local restaurants.

Airgas and its subsidiaries are America’s largest distributor of industrial, medical and specialty gases. Airgas’ parent corporation Air Liquide [EPA: AI], based in France, is the world’s largest distributor of such gases and is a Forbes Global 2000 company.

The workers at all four locations organized their unions with Local 848 last year.

As he walked the line yesterday morning, Airgas driver Mario Quintero said, “We work hard to help Airgas and Air Liquide earn huge revenues. Air Liquide earned $23 billion last year. Yet despite the work we do for Airgas, it continues to treat us abusively and with disrespect. Airgas fired employees for union activity and has harassed and intimidated many of us who chose to form a union so we could have dignity and a voice on the job. Treating workers this way is unconscionable and illegal.”

“The Teamsters Union does not condone abusive behavior by employers, and all of us at Teamsters Local 848 will back these members to ensure they are treated fairly and with respect,” said Eric Tate, Secretary-Treasurer of Teamsters Local 848 in Glendora, Calif. “Teamsters Local 848 filed multiple unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board, and the Board is now taking the company to trial over its illegal actions.”"

The industrial stretch of the Mississippi River between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, a region known as “Cancer Alley,” is one of the most highly polluted areas in the country. A ProPublica analysis using a scientific model developed by the Environmental Protection Agency shows that some of the neighborhoods where new plants are being built already have very high concentrations of toxic chemicals. But Louisiana continues to approve the building of these new plants and the expansion of existing ones.

The EPA model ProPublica used, known as Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators, or RSEI, calculates the estimated chemical concentrations from toxic industrial plant emissions across the country, down to 810-by-810-meter blocks. We then used that model to find where toxic levels of cancer-causing chemicals are highest in the seven parishes."

PACIFIC 2019: French naval defense industry sets record presence - Naval News,"Tue, 08 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vZXZlbnQtbmV3cy9wYWNpZmljLTIwMTkvMjAxOS8xMC9wYWNpZmljLTIwMTktZnJlbmNoLW5hdmFsLWluZHVzdHJ5LXNldHMtcmVjb3JkLXByZXNlbmNlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PACIFIC 2019: French naval defense industry sets record presence At the 2019 PACIFIC International Maritime Exposition, which is held in Sydney (Australia) until 10 October, the French Marine Industry Group (GICAN) is bringing together the largest delegation of businesses in the France Pavilion, with 26 businesses at its stand and, for the first time, 11 under the Australian flag or in connection with a local partner – a sign that French shipbuilding manufacturers are developing partnerships with Australian manufacturers.

14 French businesses also attends as part of the Maritime Connection Days delegation or in their own capacity on their stand: in all, more than 50 French businesses is represented in the French delegation to commit to driving forward the development of Australian industry with local partners.

In the wake of the Australian Government’s selection of Naval Group to build 12 Attack-class submarines, the GICAN is supporting the location of its members and the French shipbuilding industry in Australia, on the defence and civil markets, bolstered by the dynamic diplomatic and industrial relations between the two countries. Two Maritime Connection Days assignments have been carried out on-site by Business France, and a raft of inter-business agreements have already been secured during the EURONAVAL exhibition, which was held in France in October 2018. Since January 2019, the GICAN has been running an International Internship (VIE) in Adelaide, where the submarine building site is based, to coordinate the location and local contacts of French businesses.

The 2019 PACIFIC exhibition is a new key stage in this meaningful and symbolic relationship of the close ties that now unite French and Australian shipbuilding manufacturers, as demonstrated by the significance of the France Pavilion at the event. The GICAN is bringing together 26 manufacturers within the France Pavilion:

Naval Group, Safran, Jeumont, ECA Group, Diginext, iXblue, Souriau, Ades Technologies, Air Liquide, Besse, Coyard, Groupe FIVA, Lacroix, Axon, Expleo, SEAir, Sofresud, Ameris, Unseenlabs, Howden, Altrad, FCE, Johnson Controls Industries, Bureau Veritas, Ponticelli and Eurotorp.

What is more, 11 French shipbuilding manufacturers is exhibiting under an Australian flag or with their Australian partner, in a clear sign of their commitment to developing their partnerships in Australia, encouraged by the GICAN and Naval Group:

Predict Australia, Cadgile/FIVA, Ingeliance Australia, Adexflow/Logicam, Socitec/Mackay, CNIM, Engie-Axima/Noske Kaiser, Issartel/H.I. Fraser, DEF Marine/H.I. Fraser, AMI/ENAG.

In all, there is more than 50 French businesses attending the PACIFIC exhibition, alongside their Australian partners, within the Maritime Connection Days delegation or on their own stand.

A Franco-Australian event will be held at the PACIFIC exhibition on the morning of Wednesday 9 October, attended by all of the industrial and institutional partners from the two countries, particularly several ministers, the Australian Department of Defence, France’s Ambassador to Australia and the General Secretary of the GICAN, Mr Hervé Guillou.

Hervé Guillou, General Secretary of the GICAN and CEO of Naval Group, says: “Nearly a year on from EURONAVAL 2018, where Australia represented the largest delegation of businesses, the fact that more than 50 French businesses are now attending PACIFIC 2019 once again underscores the significance of the industrial relationship and growing cooperation between the two countries. The Australian future submarine programme – in which the strategic partnership agreement signed between Naval Group and the Commonwealth of Australia last February represents a key milestone – is a tremendous opportunity for French and Australian shipbuilding companies alike, and should help to drive forward development of the local industrial fabric. This call has once again been heeded by manufacturers, and we are delighted with the potential this presence harbours in terms of working together”.

Ian Honnery, CEO of the PACIFIC 2019 exhibition, says: “At this crucial time for the development of Australia’s future submarines, industry, the Government and local defence are set to benefit hugely from the GICAN and 50 French maritime businesses attending the PACIFIC 2019 exhibition. Their physical presence will be instrumental in building effective partnerships and cooperative frameworks with Australian industry”."
10 Countries Moving Toward a Green Hydrogen Economy - Greentech Media News,"Mon, 14 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVudGVjaG1lZGlhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9yZWFkLzEwLWNvdW50cmllcy1tb3ZpbmctdG93YXJkcy1hLWdyZWVuLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLWVjb25vbXnSAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5ncmVlbnRlY2htZWRpYS5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGUvMTAtY291bnRyaWVzLW1vdmluZy10b3dhcmRzLWEtZ3JlZW4taHlkcm9nZW4tZWNvbm9teQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide had a special gift for the U.S. on the little-known National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Day this month: The French industrial giant announced plans to make renewably produced liquid hydrogen at an upcoming plant near Las Vegas.

The company said its facility will have a production capacity of 30 tons of liquid hydrogen a day. Most of this would be destined for California, where there are plans for 200 hydrogen filling stations by 2025, Air Liquide said.

The announcement adds to the sense of a trend in the emerging sector.

“Green hydrogen seems like it’s at some sort of possible inflection,” said Ben Gallagher, an expert on carbon and emerging technology at Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables. “There’s definitely something in the air.”

Investors and policymakers are starting to take note. Although green hydrogen is still very much in its infancy, here are 10 countries that are taking steps to be at the forefront of developing what could be a major source of energy in the future.

Australia

Australia has had an almost negligible presence in green hydrogen markets to date. But it is looking to step up its participation considerably as a way of replacing fossil fuel exports with an alternative created with the country's plentiful renewable energy resources.

This month, for example, Siemens joined a partnership to develop a 5-gigawatt combined solar and wind project aimed at powering renewable hydrogen production.

Likely destinations for Australian green hydrogen include Japan and South Korea. ""Generally, we’d be looking for a country [that's] an energy importer and is seeking a low-emission fuel,” said Paul Graham, energy flagship chief economist at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation.

Canada

Canada sees potential in future green hydrogen markets, not just as a producer of the gas, based on abundant renewable resources, but also as a manufacturer of fuel cells. Natural Resources Canada, a federal department, outlined the opportunity in a paper this month.

“Based on collaboration and investments made by both the public and private sectors in past decades, Canada has a hydrogen and fuel-cell sector that thrives in export markets and that includes global leaders Ballard Power Systems and Hydrogenics,” it said.

Ballard Power Systems made headlines last year when Chinese conglomerate Weichai Power invested $163 million, buying a 19.9 percent stake in the business.

China

Along with electric vehicles, Beijing sees green hydrogen as a potential way of decarbonizing transportation, WoodMac's Gallagher said. The country's targets include 5,000 fuel-cell vehicles by 2020 and 1 million by 2030.

There are also tax exemptions for hydrogen vehicles. And Wuhan, the capital of Hubei in central China, is being styled as a hydrogen city with up to 100 fueling stations for around 5,000 fuel-cell vehicles by 2025.

“In addition, there are targets to have something like 100 manufacturers in the greater Wuhan area that are manufacturing components for fuel cells or other elements of the hydrogen economy,” said Gallagher.

France

Green hydrogen was all the rage a year ago in France. In June 2018, then-Minister for Ecological and Inclusive Transition Nicolas Hulot vowed to make France a world leader in hydrogen as he unveiled a €100 million ($117 million) investment plan for the technology.

Meanwhile, Hydrogène de France (HDF) was touting a €90 million investment in a hydrogen project in French Guiana. Now Hulot is out of office, and the HDF project has gone quiet. But that doesn’t mean France’s green hydrogen interest has waned.

September saw the country deploying its first hydrogen-powered passenger bus, and this month the Auvergne Rhône-Alpes region committed €200 million toward 1,000 hydrogen vehicles and 15 electrolyzers, to cite just two recent examples of progress.

Germany

Germany sees hydrogen potentially being used in “various applications, including transport and to decarbonize industry,” said Martin Hablutzel, head of strategy at Siemens in Australia.

The country, already a front-runner in hydrogen technology development, is aiming to up its game with plans for 20 research labs, with a total budget of €100 million ($110 million), being unveiled over the summer.

“Hydrogen is one of the hottest topics in the energy transition in the country at the moment,” Inga Posch, managing director at FNB Gas, the federation of Germany’s gas network operators, told Bloomberg in August.

Japan

Japan is arguably green hydrogen’s most advanced market worldwide, “especially with respect to importing hydrogen for domestic applications such as transport,” said Hablutzel.

The country leads the way in hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle development thanks to the efforts of auto makers such as Toyota and Honda.

And policymakers are keen to stimulate green hydrogen as an alternative to liquefied natural gas, which Japan imports more of than any other country. Last month it announced a global action plan to set up 10,000 refueling stations over the next decade.

Norway

Norway has vast potential to create hydrogen from hydropower and is pioneering the use of fuel cells in ferries. Earlier this year the country also had the dubious honor of becoming the first in the world to report a hydrogen filling station accident.

Nel Hydrogen, the filling station operator, moved quickly to share information and get to the root cause of the incident, in which two people were injured.

Michela Bortolotti, communications manager at the industry body Hydrogen Europe, said the event should not be a hindrance to the commercialization of hydrogen. “In many cases, hydrogen is safer than the fuel we currently use to power our cars,” she said.

South Korea

The Norwegian filling station incident isn’t the only safety setback to plague the nascent green hydrogen industry this year. In May, a hydrogen storage tank exploded at a government research facility in Gangneung, South Korea, killing two and injuring six.

The blast has fueled concerns over South Korea’s ambitious hydrogen rollout plans, which include getting 850,000 fuel-cell vehicles on the road by 2030, up from 3,000 this year.

The government is also planning to hand out $1.8 billion in vehicle and refueling station subsidies, even though Reuters reported last month that stations were still not economical to run.

U.K.

Looking increasingly isolated from trading partners in Europe yet blessed with one of the world’s top offshore wind markets, the U.K. is looking to renewable hydrogen as a way to reduce gas imports and help decarbonize the heating sector at the same time.

Last month, the U.K. government unveiled a £12 billion ($15 billion) plan to use 4 gigawatts of offshore wind for renewable hydrogen production in the early 2030s.

Meanwhile, U.K. hydrogen interests have been attracting international attention, with the chemicals giant Linde this month paying £38 million ($46 million) for a 20 percent stake in listed technology developer ITM Power.

U.S.

While the U.S. as a whole barely merits a mention in terms of green hydrogen development, one state, California, is racing to become a world-leading market.

California’s interest in hydrogen is driven partly by aggressive decarbonization targets, including phasing out all diesel or natural-gas-powered buses by 2040, and partly by the presence of some of the industry’s most high-profile technology developers.

Foremost among these is Silicon Valley-based fuel-cell maker Bloom Energy. But the company is still struggling to achieve something no publicly traded fuel-cell company has ever done: turn an annual profit."
Air Liquide partners with ArcelorMittal in pilot project to capture and recycle carbon - Air Liquide,"Thu, 17 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5haXJsaXF1aWRlLmNvbS9ncm91cC9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy1uZXdzLzIwMTktMTAtMTcvYWlyLWxpcXVpZGUtcGFydG5lcnMtYXJjZWxvcm1pdHRhbC1waWxvdC1wcm9qZWN0LWNhcHR1cmUtYW5kLXJlY3ljbGUtY2FyYm9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide is partnering with ArcelorMittal in the first industrial scale demonstration plant to capture carbon gas from the steelmaking process and recycle it into chemicals, specifically advanced bioethanol*.

In this project, Air Liquide Engineering & Construction will provide a technology solution that purifies the offgas coming from the blast furnace. These gases will then be injected into a bioreactor to produce bioethanol. This technology leverages Air Liquide’s extensive know-how and illustrates its capacity to develop sustainable solutions supporting its customers in the steel industry to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The project is led by the world-leading steel company ArcelorMittal together with its partner Lanzatech, and supported by EU Horizon 2020, the EU research and innovation program. Located at ArcelorMittal’s steel plant in Ghent, Belgium, this first industrial scale demonstration plant will produce advanced bioethanol from waste gases from the steelmaking process. Construction of the facility is underway at the ArcelorMittal site in Ghent Belgium and the plant is planned to become operational at the end of 2020. It is expected to produce 80 million litres of bioethanol annually.

François Venet, Senior Vice President Strategy and member of the Air Liquide group’s Executive Committee supervising the Large Industries Business Line and Engineering & Construction stated:

”This new partnership with ArcelorMittal demonstrates our shared commitment to contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This is also a clear illustration of the initiatives Air Liquide has committed to as part of its Climate Objectives.

The market is driven by the stringent regulations for the reduction of GHG emissions. In addition, the growing popularity of integrated waste management system (IWMS) is anticipated to further boost the growth of the biogas market.

The increase in the amount of methane, carbon dioxide, and GHGs in the atmosphere caused by the combustion of fossil fuels is leading to climate change. This is encouraging the governments to come up with initiatives to minimize the methane emissions that are released from livestock, agricultural produce and decaying organic waste. The installation of biogas energy plants offers the best solution to reduce methane emissions as biogas plants generate energy by capturing methane gas. Also, biogas is an alternative source of renewable energy. Thus, the stringent regulations for the reduction of GHG emissions is expected to drive market growth during the forecast period.

Air Liquide Nigeria Plans N2.07bn Rights Issue - Business Post Nigeria,"Tue, 22 Oct 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3Nwb3N0Lm5nL2Vjb25vbXkvYWlyLWxpcXVpZGUtcGxhbnMtbjItMDdibi1yaWdodHMtaXNzdWUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Adedapo Adesanya

The board of Air Liquide Nigeria Plc has expressed its desire to raise fresh capital from the capital market through a rights issue. A notice from the NASD Over-The-Counter Securities Exchange disclosed that the company intends to raise the sum of N2.07 billion from its existing shareholders.

Air Liquide is a world leader in gases, technologies and services for industry and health. The company has presence in 80 countries with approximately 66,000 employees and serves more than 3.6 million customers and patients.

In the NASD notice, it was stated that Air Liquide, through its stockbroker, Stanbic IBTC Stockbrokers Limited, filed an application to seek approval for the rights issue and its eventual listing on the exchange’s trading platform.

The firm plans to sell a total of 414,000,000 units of 50k each of the shares at N5 per unit on the basis of 23 new ordinary shares for every 10 ordinary shares held.

According to the notice, only shareholders who had shares of the Air Liquide as at the close of business on Tuesday, October 15, 2019, would be able to buy the additional shares at the above price.

“Participating institutions of the NASD OTC Securities Exchange are hereby notified that Air Liquide Plc (SDAIRLIQ) has through its stockbroker, Stanbic IBTC Stockbrokers Limited, submitted an application to The NASD OTC Securities Exchange for the approval and listing of a rights issue of four hundred and fourteen million (414,000,000) units of 50k each at five Naira (N5.00) per share, on the basis of twenty-three (23) new ordinary shares for every ten (10) ordinary shares held.

“The qualification date for the rights is today, Tuesday, 15 October 2019,” the notice issued last week read.

Business Post reports that as at the time of filing this report, shares of Air Liquide Nigeria Plc were traded at N6.00 per unit. This rate is its 52-week high, while N5.50 per share is its 52-week low.

Recall that last month, the NASD gave companies listed on its platform the room to seek ways to raise fresh capital for their operations through rights issue. Since the exchange gave out guidelines on how to go about their route, Air Liquide is the first firm to seek this alternative form of sourcing for funds.
