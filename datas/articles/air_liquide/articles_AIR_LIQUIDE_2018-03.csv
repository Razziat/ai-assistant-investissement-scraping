Japan car giants team up to build hydrogen stations - Phys.org,"Mon, 05 Mar 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDE4LTAzLWphcGFuLWNhci1naWFudHMtdGVhbS1oeWRyb2dlbi5odG1s0gFAaHR0cHM6Ly9waHlzLm9yZy9uZXdzLzIwMTgtMDMtamFwYW4tY2FyLWdpYW50cy10ZWFtLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toyota produced the world's first fuel-cell car

Top Japanese carmakers said on Monday they were teaming up to nearly double the amount of hydrogen stations in Japan, as the car-mad country seeks to head off competition from China and Germany.

Toyota, Nissan and Honda formed a joint venture with major gas and energy companies, including French industrial gases company Air Liquide, to build 80 new hydrogen stations in the next four years, to add to the 101 stations currently in Japan.

""At this stage, we believe there is significant space for cooperation, rather than searching for areas of competition,"" Shigeki Terashi, Toyota executive vice president told reporters.

The new venture—""Japan H2 Mobility"" or ""JHyM""—comes as the world's top economies rush to issue tougher environmental regulations that are spurring development of new clean cars and trucks.

Japan has focused on promoting fuel-cells, which combine hydrogen and oxygen in an electrochemical reaction, producing clean electricity to power vehicles or home generators.

But fuel-cell vehicles cannot get off the ground without a network of hydrogen stations, and vice versa, and the chicken-and-egg dilemma has stalled the roll-out of the technology, say industry professionals.

Hydrogen stations and fuel cell vehicles must be promoted in tandem in order to lower their cost, executives said.

""Unless infrastructure makers team up, new hydrogen stations tend to be concentrated in urban areas,"" said Hideki Sugawara, president of the new firm.

""In order to maximise the demand for FCVs (fuel cell vehicles), we have to expand geographically,"" he said.

The 101 hydrogen stations serve around 2,400 fuel-cell cars in Japan, according to official data, but a lack of viable stations has been a major hurdle for carmakers as they seek to boost production.

The Japanese government and the auto industry aim to introduce 160 stations and 40,000 fuel-cell vehicles by March 2020.

The government is also pushing to deregulate the sector to lower costs.

Toyota launched the Mirai, the world's first mass-market hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle, in late 2014 as it looked to push further into the fast-growing market for environmentally friendly cars.

Nissan and Honda also have their version of fuel-cell projects.

Outline for Europe's first waste to methanol plant - Chemistry World,"Fri, 02 Mar 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZW1pc3RyeXdvcmxkLmNvbS9uZXdzL291dGxpbmUtZm9yLWV1cm9wZXMtZmlyc3Qtd2FzdGUtdG8tbWV0aGFub2wtcGxhbnQvMzAwODcyOS5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A facility to convert non-recyclable waste into valuable raw materials is being planned at the port of Rotterdam. Canadian company Enerkem, is working with AkzoNobel Speciality Chemicals, and industrial gases group Air Liquide to develop a plant that will convert 350,000 tonnes of waste, including plastics, into 270 million litres of ‘green’ methanol, each year.

The consortium says this represents the annual waste of more than 700,000 households and will avoid some 300,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.

The methanol will be used as a biofuel, and by AkzoNobel to produce dimethyl ether, chloromethane and other chemical intermediaries currently produced from fossil fuel sources. Air Liquide will provide the oxygen, and together with AkzoNobel, the hydrogen required for the reactions.

Marco Waas, director of research, development and innovation at AkzoNobel’s industrial chemicals business, described the project as ‘a significant step toward implementing a sustainable and circular chemical industry’. He added that the agreement came at ‘a very appropriate time given the current challenges in plastics recycling in Europe.’ Recycling plants are struggling to cope since China banned imports of plastic waste, from January this year.

The firms will make a final decision on the $200m investment later this year, once permitting and detailed engineering planning are complete. However, Enerkem says there are currently limited support mechanisms to incentivise such sustainable chemistry initiatives: the Dutch government has undertaken to bring forward new policy measures to support the project.

The plant will be twice the size of Enerkem’s waste to ethanol plant in Edmonton – expected to be at full production later this year. That facility initially produced only methanol to obtain sustainability certification, and to demonstrate purity and process viability to potential European partners.

Enerkem’s four-step process begins with gasification of the waste. The gasifier contains hot sand at 700°C, steam and very little oxygen, so when it’s added, the waste is converted to carbon monoxide and hydrogen rather than being burnt. The synthetic gas is cooled and ‘scrubbed’ to remove impurities and contaminants. Edmonton’s facility doesn’t use renewable energy, but the heat is recovered and re-used in the gasifier to maintain the fluidity of the hot sand.

The syngas is heated again and the carbon monoxide and hydrogen combine at a specified temperature and pressure, in the presence of a copper catalyst. Lastly, the methanol is distilled from the gas.An Enerkem spokesman said the Rotterdam facility would benefit from ‘many small, but important’ process improvements that have been made since the Edmonton plant opened."

30 Solidia Concrete™ blocks will absorb 22kg of CO2 at production. In one year, a tree will do the same. 30 Solidia Concrete™ blocks will absorb 22kg of CO2 at production. In one year, a tree will do the same.

Solidia Technologies® Chief Commercial Officer Bo Boylan joined environmental leaders at a meeting of The California Air Resources Board (CARB) to discuss the impact of Solidia’s ecofriendly cement and concrete systems on California, including a 30% reduction in carbon emissions in the production of cement. Coupled with the capture of another 240 kg of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) during cement curing, Solidia’s processes can reduce the carbon footprint of cement and concrete in the state by 70%.

“In California alone, our technologies would result in a reduction of more than four million metric tonnes of carbon emissions at cement kilns,” said Dr. Boylan. “By curing concrete with CO 2 instead of water, we can also safely and permanently sequester 3.4 metric tonnes of CO 2 in concrete products and save Californians 27 billion gallons of water each year.”

Additional environmental benefits that would be accrued at California cement plants include a 50% reduction of emissions of nitrogen oxide (5,000 metric tonnes), a 30% reduction in mercury emissions (110 kg), and a 30% reduction in energy consumption (13,000,000 gigajoules).

Each ton of cement produces approximately one ton of CO 2 , making cement production the second largest industrial CO 2 polluter, representing 5-7% of the world’s total CO 2 emissions. California’s nine cement kilns emit 13.53 metric tonnes of CO 2 each year.

CARB describes its Green Building effort as encouraging design that accomplishes several environmental goals, including lowering GHG emissions: “Because buildings represent one of the largest sources of GHG emissions in California, the Green Buildings effort affords numerous ways to address environmental goals while lowering GHG emissions. Green buildings offer a cost-effective way to limit the use of energy, water and waste in residential and commercial buildings. Furthermore, by designing buildings to accomplish several environmental attributes from the beginning, the green building approach integrates renewable power generation, energy efficiency, water and waste reduction.”

Easy to adopt anywhere in the world, Solidia’s systems produce a sustainable cement and cure concrete with CO 2 instead of water, while utilizing manufacturers’ existing infrastructure, raw materials, formulations, production methods and specifications. Stronger, more durable and higher performing than traditional concrete, Solidia Concrete™ products cost less to produce, reduce water and energy use, and cure in less than 24 hours.

""We applaud CARB for its commitment to environmental design through its Green Building effort,” explained Dr. Boylan. “That innovative mindset is a primary incentive for us to target California, which makes up the sixth largest economy in the world and is the second largest producer and consumer of cement in the country. Our technology has the potential to make a huge impact both environmentally and as an engine for economic growth as we give cement and concrete manufacturers a massive competitive edge.”

Enerkem already have a successful waste-to-chemistry plant operating in Edmonton, Canada

A FACILITY that will convert non-recyclable wastes into biofuels and chemicals for industrial use will open in Rotterdam in the Netherlands.

The project development agreement was signed by Air Liquide, AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals, Enerkem, and the Port of Rotterdam, with an initial investment of €9m (US$11m). The final investment decision, worth €200m, will be made later this year. Up to 300,000t of waste, which is the total annual waste of 700,000 households, will be diverted from landfills and incinerators and instead used as a feedstock to produce 220,000t of methanol.

“The agreement comes at a very appropriate time given the current challenges in plastics recycling in Europe,” said Marco Waas, director of RD&I at AkzoNobel. “We can convert non-recyclable waste into methanol, an essential raw material for many everyday products, including sustainable transportation fuel. Not only can this be used in the existing supply chains and replace fossil sources, but it also avoids CO 2 emissions otherwise produced by burning waste.”

The facility will built within the Port of Rotterdam and will be the first of its kind in Europe. Enerkem, whose proprietary technology will be used to produce the methanol, already operates a commercial-scale plant in Edmonton, Canada. This began operations in 2016, and has also been producing ethanol since 2017. The planned facility at Rotterdam will have twice the input capacity of the Edmonton plant.

Enerkem's process converts waste into methanol via gasification, syngas conditioning, and catalytic synthesis. The non-recyclable, non-compostable waste is sorted and shredded, before being added to the gasifier along with oxygen and steam. This converts around 90% of the carbon in the waste feedstock to a syngas, which is then purified. The syngas is reacted with a catalyst to produce the methanol.

Air Liquide will supply the oxygen for the syngas production. Hydrogen will be provided by both Air Liquide and AkzoNobel, which will be used in the catalytic conversion stage. Hydrogen is not part of the production at the Edmonton plant, but will be used at the Rotterdam facility as it is readily available via the synergy between partners. Both Air Liquide and AkzoNobel have plans underway for producing hydrogen via environmentally friendly methods."

And I’m not referring to the early 80s when the film was made – although that too is a weird place, where aliens can arrive in New York City in search of heroin, infiltrating a trashy urban club underworld of electro-squalor, abjection-chic and bisexual androgyny. No, I’m talking about the mid-90s, when I watched the film at the small independent Lux Cinema – the art space that helped to transform East London’s Hoxton area from no-go zone to the hipster paradise it is now – only to close down due to unsecured rent rises. At that point, Liquid Sky to me was the name of a pair of small clubs in New York and Cologne, plus an associated record label, which was putting out some remarkable raw, acid-bitten techno records. It also made sense of Air Liquide, the name of the electronic music duo of Dr Walker and Jammin Unit, two mysterious and mercurial figures whose names, in a variety of aliases, had been cropping up on a range of records and white labels since around 1991.

Reliving those years reminded me how different things were nearly 25 years ago. Far from the current spate of retromania, the cutting edge was exactly that, a burgeoning flood of desktop powered electronic music whose every new iteration seemed to speak of things to come rather than things that have been. In the mid-90s, the internet was an infant. Today’s social media and market-driven online culture requires you to be the person you really are. The mid-90s was still a digital wild west, devoid of two-step authentifications, multiple passwords and ‘likes’. Everything was freely given over for grabs. The remix was paradigmatic: tracks frequently submitted in multiple versions, authorship subdivided and atomised into a globally distribute collective consciousness. In this utopian open studio, artist aliases ran amok. It’s incredible, re-reading some of the key texts of that era in electronic music, how much energy we spent as writers just keeping track of who was who. Discogs.com now does a better job of keeping track of the aka trail of producers like Germans Jammin Unit, Khan and Wolfgang Voigt. In those days you had to do a lot of detective work, reading the clues in the names as they morphed from 12"" to 12"".

It’s a long time since I listened closely to much of this material, but it’s sobering to think that the time distance between now and its 1994–97 heyday stands in a similar relation as the mid-90s did to krautrock, progressive music and the early days of ambient. Given the enduring rarity of many of the releases, it all feels equally worthy of a critical rediscovery.

The articles chosen below trace the development of a critical style around the genre we loosely dubbed electronica and shows its international spread.

Rob Young: Worlds Collide (The Wire 142, December 1995)

“Don’t call it Ambient, because most of this stuff travels and hypervelocities and staggering gaits hardly explicable/believable in ballistic/osteopathic terms...” There was a lot crammed into this rather breathless genre piece that tried to map out an emerging landscape, with the creative remix projects of Lo Recordings as one tentative foothold.

Simon Reynolds: Mille Plateaux (The Wire 146, April 1996)

The Frankfurt based Mille Plateaux label was one of the consistently enthralling imprints of the 90s, pumping out visceral and tactile music underpinned by hardcore Deleuzian theory. Simon Reynolds’s epic encounter with Achim Szepanski, Mille’s mercurial and eventually maligned founder, was a key moment in bringing it all out in the open.

Rob Young: Cologne Central (The Wire 159, May 1997)

In one head spinning week I managed to interview Can in their original studio and tack on a round of interviews with the prime movers from an extraordinary underground electronic and experimental scene shaping up in Cologne. Billetted at the A-Musik record shop in a concrete basement in the Belgian quarter, I tried to connect the dots between the abstractionists like Pluramon (Marcus Schmickler), Microstoria (Mouse On Mars meets Oval) and the A-Musik label, and the more beats-driven Liquid Sky scene of Dr Walker, Air Liquide and pre-Kompakt Wolfgang Voigt. There was no PR structure around this stuff, so you just had to kind of breeze into it all, talk to people and build the connections.

David Toop: Pete Namlook (The Wire 197, September 1994)

We used to receive about ten CDs a week (it felt like) from the Fax label, run singlehandedly by the late producer Peter Kuhlmann (aka Pete Namlook). In retrospect he seems among the first to have taken advantage of the creative anonymity of electronic music, practically reinventing his artist name with each new project or collaboration. Another key to Fax was in the name: this label was a Gesamtkustwerk, dedicated to connecting people around the world, identifying those who spoke the same sonic language, and plugging them into an ongoing continuum of your own making.

Rob Young: Khan & Jammin Unit (The Wire 155, January 1997)

These guys popped up in so many different configurations and across so many different projects, it was hard to decide when and how to pin them down for a magazine article. This one was notionally hung on UMO (Unidentified Musical Object), a super-obscure one-off release on the Liquid Sky label whose looming menace still sounds amazing. Not the most forthcoming types, so I found myself working to fill in the gaps.

Peter Shapiro: The Illbient Alliance (The Wire 154, December 1996)

In another of our 90s genre overviews, Peter Shapiro nailed the brief flare-up of an underground New York scene that pitched dub, hiphop, sampladelia and electro into a dystopian sci-fi dumpster and set it on fire beneath the Brooklyn Bridge.

Tony Herrington: Bedouin Ascent (The Wire 131, January 1995)

London based Kingsuk Biswas existed in a class of one and his self-produced music at the time sounded utterly alien, appearing to set atoms vibrating around unfamiliar rhythmic nuclei, while the ghosts of Chick Corea and Keith Jarrett lurked over his shoulder. Tony Herrington’s one-pager distilled what I gather was a small fraction of a very long exchange that ranged over quantum physics, chaos theory and god knows what else, but it offers a glimpse of the grand designs that artists were often pouring into this music. Interview kinda cloudy…"

Both sides stand firm on WTO rules, have bigger room to cooperate, experts believe

China and the European Union will have bigger room to cooperate and the nation could offer favorable policies to the EU in market access, experts said on Thursday.

Sun Yongfu, former director-general of the Department European Affairs of the Ministry of Commerce, said China's massive market size remains attractive to the EU, and as the two sides stand firmly with the World Trade Organization, there will be big room to build closer ties.

""Compared with the United States, the EU has relatively less restrictions on the import and export of the high-tech products with China. Europe is also China's major partner in services, technology and related products. We need to take the EU into consideration to facilitate the country's industrial upgrading progress,"" Sun said at a seminar on the possible trade conflict between China and the US in Beijing.

Sun said both China and the EU are supporters of globalization, comply with rules of WTO and stand firmly against unilateralism and trade war.

""Both China and the EU agree if there is any trade conflict, it should be solved through the WTO,"" Sun said.

""The trade volume between China and the EU saw a yearly increase of 12.7 percent in 2017 and the figure surpassed $100 billion in the first two months of 2018,"" he said. ""It is relatively smaller compared to that with the US, but it certainly has potential to grow.""

Sun also said the EU has the same demand from China as the US, therefore the question of how to conduct production capacity cooperation with the EU needs to be well addressed in case of future trade conflicts.

""When trade and technology cooperation between China and the US faces a standoff, there will be more room for China and the EU to work together,"" said Lu Yuebing, president of the China branch of Air Liquide, the French industrial gases and services provider.

""China and the EU are more complementary to each other, while there is more competition between China and the US,"" said Lu.

""The US is a superpower because of its strength in innovation and creativity in the high tech sector and having a huge market that is truly internationalized,"" Lu said.

""However, the EU is also proficient in developing future technologies, while China has an attractive market, open-minded consumers, well-developed infrastructure and a supportive government. It gives the two sides solid ground for high-tech cooperation,"" Lu added.

He said the country is already in close cooperation with the EU in many aspects including high-speed railways, nuclear power and hydrogen energy."

The companies have also agreed to form a consortium to develop opportunities presented by digitally empowered plants within the coal chemical industry.

Yitai’s brownfield sites will be upgraded with ABB’s telecommunications technologies. Yitai will also benefit from ABB’s collaborative network which connects people in production facilities with those at headquarters. The data flow between various plant systems and departments will help to improve operational efficiency.

Gu Chunyuan, president of Asia, Middle East and Africa Region, ABB Group, and chairman and president of ABB (China) said: ""At present, a new round of technological upgrading and industrial transformation has promoted rapid changes in the industrial field. Digital and intelligent technologies have become the important driving force and developmental direction of global industrial change. Through this cooperation, ABB combines its own advanced technologies and practical solutions with Yitai's industry expertise in the coal chemical industry.”

World's largest oxygen production plant inaugurated at Sasol Secunda - Creamer Media's Engineering News,"Mon, 26 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vbS5lbmdpbmVlcmluZ25ld3MuY28uemEvYXJ0aWNsZS93b3JsZHMtbGFyZ2VzdC1veHlnZW4tcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1wbGFudC1pbmF1Z3VyYXRlZC1hdC1zYXNvbC1zZWN1bmRhLTIwMTgtMDMtMjbSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa on Monday inaugurated French gas company Air Liquide’s €200-million air separation unit (ASU) at chemicals and energy group Sasol's Secunda plant, in Mpumalanga.

The ASU is the biggest oxygen production unit in the world, with a capacity of 5 000 t/d and brings the total number of ASUs in Sasol’s fleet to 17, said joint Sasol CEO Bongani Nqwababa.

The 16 ASUs that Air Liquide built for Sasol prior to the new plant had a capacity of 40 000 t/d of oxygen.

The new plant will further increase oxygen for Sasol’s fuels and chemicals production processes. The ASU also produces gases such as xenon and krypton, which are used in medical scanners and high-speed photography equipment.

Unlike the other ASUs which are operated in-house, Air Liquide will own and operate the new plant, which is considered the most energy-efficient oxygen train on Sasol’s site.

Air Liquide CEO Benoît Potier said at the launch event, which Engineering News Online attended, that the ASU would provide the French company with a new source of liquid gases to supply the growing industrial gas market in South Africa.

“Our commitment is not only to Sasol, but also the South Africa economy and society. Our first Air Liquide branch was inaugurated in South Africa more than 60 years ago and we have since demonstrated commitment in developing industrial infrastructures,” said Potier, adding that Air Liquide employed 800 people in South Africa in the industrial and health sectors.

French embassy representative Emmanual Suquet said that the investment by Air Liquide was testament to the business confidence that French companies have in South Africa.

Molewa commented that the capital investment from Air Liquide went a long way in terms of creating jobs during construction and operation.

“We need more such investments to address the 26% unemployment rate in South Africa,” she stated.

The ASU was designed, developed and commissioned in three years."
French firms explore business opportunities in Ethiopia - ethiopiaobserver.com,"Fri, 09 Mar 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV0aGlvcGlhb2JzZXJ2ZXIuY29tLzIwMTgvMDMvMDkvZnJlbmNoLWZpcm1zLWV4cGxvcmUtYnVzaW5lc3Mtb3Bwb3J0dW5pdGllcy1pbi1ldGhpb3BpYS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Officials of the French business confederation (MEDEF) are in Ethiopia to explore and identify projects they want to invest in, according to the French daily Le Monde. After undertaking similar tasks in Kenya for three days, 40 business executives under the umbrella of MEDEF have arrived in Addis Ababa on Thursday for two days stay, the paper wrote. The group was led by Pierre Gattaz, the head of MEDEF in its first visit of East Africa. The companies included 40 major French firms Schneider Electric, Total, Urbasolar, Peugeot, Sse Air Liquide, Semmaris and Bollore among many more. MEDEF officials sees prospect in the country that has an estimated GDP of USD 63 billion in 2015 and has achieved has achieved double- digit growth in real terms, averaging 10.6% per year in the last decade. Nearly 70 French companies are already present in the country, including the brewer BGI Castel, Total, and Systra, engaged in the rail sector. Bernard Coulais, general manager of BGI, told the French entrepreneurs that Ethiopia is country where there is a lot do. Talking about the group that has been present in the country for the past twenty years, he said at the start BGI used to produce between 10000 and 15000 hectolitres of beer per month. “Today, we are producing between 35,000 and 400,000.” He also talked about the challenges, saying that “it is a bureaucratic country, very state-controlled and the banking system has not developed. ”

During the visit, the group paid a visit to the Ethiopian Airlines, the biggest enterprise of the country and the only African operator of the Airbus A350-900 XWB. Le Monde wrote despite the economic growth of the country, the recent political turmoil could upset the economic perspective and the country has been in the lime light for the wrong reasons, for political instability, the resignation of the Prime Minister and the declaration of state of emergency. The paper quoted a Kenyan based European analyst who described Ethiopia “the sick country of the region, where it’s cracking everywhere.” Strange context for investors exploring business opportunities, the paper wrote."
