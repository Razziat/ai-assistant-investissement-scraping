Air Liquide's Place de l'Alma hydrogen station gets Olympic ready - gasworld,"Thu, 28 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdhc3dvcmxkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9haXItbGlxdWlkZXMtcGxhY2UtZGUtbGFsbWEtaHlkcm9nZW4tc3RhdGlvbi1nZXRzLW9seW1waWMtcmVhZHkvMjEzNjUyNC5hcnRpY2xlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide’s Place de l’Alma hydrogen station gets Olympic ready

A hydrogen refuelling station located in the heart of Paris has taken on a new look in the lead up to the Olympic and Paralympic Games, to begin in just over 100 days time.

Designed and installed by Air Liquide at Place de l’Alma, the facility will act as a showcase of the network of stations deployed in Ile-de-France (Greater Paris area).

According to the company, this network will supply renewable hydrogen to Paris 2024’s official fleet, which includes 500 hydrogen-powered Toyota Mirai cars.

“Paris 2024 represents a fantastic opportunity to accelerate the development and the adoption of hydrogen, a key solution to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, in particular for intensive transport,” said Armelle Levieux, member of Air Liquide’s Executive Committee overseeing hydrogen activities.

Figures from the Ministere de la Transition Ecologique reveal that transport accounts for around 25% of CO2 emissions globally.

In response to this, Air Liquide has multiplied by ten the volumes of hydrogen supply to mobility worldwide in two years.

“Present across the entire hydrogen value chain, Air Liquide contributes to the development of hydrogen, an essential molecule in the energy transition,” added Levieux.

Hydrogen has shown to be particularly suitable for long distance travel. For a typical hydrogen-powered car, a five minute fill-up can fuel a distance of up to 650 km.

The industrial gas major announced its support for the Games last year under the banner of organising ‘more sustainable Games’.

Speaking at the time, President of Paris 2024 Tony Estanguet, emphasised the need to rethink all the major features of the event to ensure that the Games are made more sustainable.

“By supplying hydrogen of renewable origin for the vehicles for athletes and officials, Air Liquide will help us reduce the carbon footprint of the Games,” he said.

Renewable origin means that the hydrogen will be produced from water electrolysis or biomethane with guarantees of origin.

Paris Region has pledged to make renewable energies account for 40% of Paris’ energy consumption by 2030 and for 100% by 2050.

To reach these targets, Paris Region says it has developed and implemented a range of measures to drive the growth of low-carbon hydrogen.

This will see the deployment of 6.5GW (gigawatts) of electrolysers to be deployed in France by 2030 and a goal to make hydrogen comprise 12% of Europe’s energy mix by 2050.

“Hydrogen is no longer an anecdotal solution for clean mobility but an essential element in meeting the challenges of energy transition and air quality,” said Thomas Hemmerdinger, Project Manager of the Energy Transition and Circular Economy for Institute Paris Region.

“One of the challenges now is to develop a green hydrogen production chain, based on local renewable energy sources, at a competitive price and with a distribution system that ensures a coherent and secure network throughout the region with clearly identified users.”

Earlier this year, the industrial gas major narrowed its focus on hydrogen refuelling by launching a joint venture with TotalEnergies called TEAL Mobility.

The partnership aims to accelerate the development of hydrogen for heavy duty trucks by offering a network of 100 stations on major corridors during the next decade.

Around 20 stations in France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany are slated to come on stream this year."
"Hydrogen, a solution to accelerate the decarbonization of freight transport - Air Liquide","Fri, 15 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvaHlkcm9nZW4vaHlkcm9nZW4tc29sdXRpb24tYWNjZWxlcmF0ZS1kZWNhcmJvbml6YXRpb24tZnJlaWdodC10cmFuc3BvcnTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Road freight transport accounts for a quarter of all mobility-related CO 2 emissions. Faced with this challenge, European Union member states have tightened the rules on carbon emission reductions for new heavy goods vehicles entering the market. The goal? A 45% reduction by 2030 and a 90% reduction by 2040 (compared with 2019 levels). To achieve these highly ambitious targets, hydrogen will have to become an indispensable part of the energy mix. Thierry Carbonnel, Marketing Director for Heavy Duty Mobility, Air Liquide, delves into the key challenges facing the sector.

What role does hydrogen currently play when it comes to road transport? It might seem like the era of hydrogen-powered road transport is still in its infancy, but that's not quite true! Several thousand hydrogen-powered trucks and buses already ply the roads in China. In Europe, the growth of hydrogen mobility began with intensively-used professional fleets of passenger cars. The example that immediately springs to mind are the HysetCo taxis in the Paris region. It demonstrated the reliability of hydrogen vehicles, while popularizing the benefits of hydrogen. On the road, hydrogen translates to less noise, a real driving comfort, and water vapor being the only exhaust emission.

If we turn our attention to the world's leading truck manufacturers, they are all aware of the deadlines that lie ahead. They all have at least one hydrogen truck project, completed or ongoing. They came in various shapes and forms: prototypes, pre-series ranges or even final mass-produced vehicles! Daimler Truck, for instance, is testing two prototypes equipped with fuel cells, one running on gaseous hydrogen, the other on liquid hydrogen. IVECO will deliver its first series production vehicles in 2024 as part of the HyAMMED project. There's also Hyundai, a new player in the sector, which has deployed its first hydrogen trucks in Switzerland and the United States. What are the different technologies used in hydrogen-powered trucks? When it comes to powertrains, there are two complementary options. Several manufacturers are exploring them head-on to support the transition period. In the first option, in simple terms, fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) convert the hydrogen stored on board into electricity and then work like electric vehicles. Trucks currently being developed benefit directly from all the advances made in FC technology (notably cost reduction and energy efficiency). The other way is the internal combustion engine (ICE). Here, hydrogen gas is injected to replace diesel. This is known as ""retrofitting"". It implies a limited impact on vehicle design and maintenance, since diesel engines have been around for over 130 years, and the technology has been tried and tested by manufacturers, garages, and truck drivers. While ICE generates fine particles and NOx, albeit in much smaller quantities than diesel, mature technologies for capturing these exhaust emissions do exist. The bottom line is that, in the space of just a few years, truck manufacturers have positioned themselves remarkably to respond to the climate emergency and the new regulations. When you consider the classic truck product development cycle, this is quite astonishing.

What are the main advantages of hydrogen from a transport operator’s point of view? For transport operators, there are three obvious advantages. They are particularly important, as they affect the drivers' work rhythm and therefore the fluidity of operations. First, there's the refueling time. Hydrogen makes it possible to fill up in 15 to 20 minutes. This is close to the time required to fill up with diesel and thus has little to no impact on logistics or scheduling. Then there's range. The same tank of fuel can cover 800 to 900 km. This can be extended to 1,000 km with liquid hydrogen, as Daimler Truck demonstrated in 2023. For a driver, that's some peace of mind! Finally, there's the payload, which hydrogen technology doesn't impact, since 70 to 80 kg of on-board hydrogen is enough, without the need for batteries, which reduces the volume and weight that trucks can carry. All in all, hydrogen is particularly well-suited to long-distance transport, providing flexibility and productivity. It is a good complement to electric vehicles, which are relevant for planned, short-distance routes.

There remains the question of the cost of transitioning to hydrogen… Naturally, all players are mindful of the costs of hydrogen mobility, from the price of the vehicles to the price of hydrogen at the filling station. A model shared by several major European automakers predicts hydrogen/diesel parity by 2030. Factors favoring hydrogen include a gradual drop in the price per kilo of the molecule, lower truck manufacturing and maintenance costs and tax incentives. At the same time, we're likely to see an increase in taxation, both on diesel and on the Eurovignette road tax. The gradual transition of fleets will therefore depend on the implementation of appropriate and, I would say, ambitious public policy measures! What are Air Liquide's strengths in meeting the challenge of decarbonizing road transport? Well, that’s an easy question to answer! We cover the entire hydrogen value chain. Air Liquide's core business focuses on production, storage, conditioning, and distribution. So, it's on these levers that we act first and foremost. When it comes to production, there's no secret: we need to produce a growing share of low-carbon or renewable hydrogen. Otherwise, we won't be able to meet the challenge of decarbonizing transport. Major investments have been made, such as our 200 MW Air Liquide Normand'Hy electrolyzer, due to come on stream in 2026. In other words, 200 MW translates to 28,000 tons of hydrogen produced in one year, a part of which will supply the mobility sector. What's more, mass production will help to bring the cost of low-carbon hydrogen down to a competitive level more quickly. This is also why we are working on a number of technological building blocks. Competitiveness, safety, reliability and lower TCO are our priorities.

How does Air Liquide intend to support players in the transport sector in their transition to hydrogen? The decarbonization of road transport is a collective enterprise. With this in mind, we have developed a number of partnerships and projects that enable us to better understand and provide solutions to the problems faced by all the major players in the sector: automakers, equipment manufacturers, fleet operators, etc. Our support focuses on technologies. This is the case, for example, with FORVIA (Faurecia), with whom we are working to develop the liquid hydrogen tanks of tomorrow. We also help our customers to find the subsidies they need to make the transition to hydrogen. Funding can be obtained from various bodies: the European Union, governments, regions, etc. Customers who would like to test hydrogen right now and evaluate available technologies should know that it's possible, and that we're here to help."

Investing in L'Air Liquide (EPA:AI) five years ago would have delivered you a 124% gain - Simply Wall St,"Thu, 28 Mar 2024 04:21:19 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3NpbXBseXdhbGwuc3Qvc3RvY2tzL2ZyL21hdGVyaWFscy9lcGEtYWkvbGFpci1saXF1aWRlLXNoYXJlcy9uZXdzL2ludmVzdGluZy1pbi1sYWlyLWxpcXVpZGUtZXBhYWktZml2ZS15ZWFycy1hZ28td291bGQtaGF2ZS1kZS0y0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. One great example is L'Air Liquide S.A. ( ) which saw its share price drive 102% higher over five years.

Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns.

In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.

During five years of share price growth, L'Air Liquide achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 7.6% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 15% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.

The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).

We know that L'Air Liquide has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.

What About Dividends?

When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, L'Air Liquide's TSR for the last 5 years was 124%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!

A Different Perspective

It's nice to see that L'Air Liquide shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 30% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 18%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper.

France-based industrial gases company Air Liquide has broken ground on a new $20.15m (RMB 145m) hydrogen filling centre at the Binhai New Area SEZ in Tianjin, China.

Air Liquide signed an agreement with Tianjin Port Free Trade Zone in 2023 to build, own, and operate the hydrogen filling centre designed to support the development of a hydrogen ecosystem in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (Jingjinji) Region.

The centre has a proposed filling capacity of eight tonnes per day and is expected to be operational by the end of 2024.



Rui Coelho, CEO of Air Liquide China, said: “Hydrogen is a key vector to accelerate the energy transition. With 60 years of expertise in the hydrogen value chain, Air Liquide is pleased to partner with the Tianjin Government to lead the hydrogen upstream deployment in the Tianjin Port Free Trade Zone. We will leverage our technological know-how and operations experience, and actively cooperate with local authorities, energy players, and fleet operators to contribute to decarbonizing mobility and creating a more sustainable future.”



A hydrogen filling centre is a conditioning unit in which gaseous hydrogen received by pipeline is compressed to transport it using tube trailer trucks to either hydrogen refueling station (HRS) or industrial customers.



Located in the Jingjinji region, the new centre is the latest addition to Air Liquide China’s portfolio. The company already operates two other hydrogen filling centres there with a total capacity of 4.2 tonnes per day to support glassmaking, optical fibre, metallurgy, and electronics customers.

Headquartered in Paris, Air Liquide SA is a multinational supplier of industrial gases present in 72 countries and employing around 67,800 workers worldwide."

Methane Reforming: Solving the Hydrogen Blues - ChemEngOnline,"Sat, 09 Mar 2024 03:53:26 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZW1lbmdvbmxpbmUuY29tL2Z1bGxzY3JlZW4vbWV0aGFuZS1yZWZvcm1pbmctc29sdmluZy10aGUtaHlkcm9nZW4tYmx1ZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Improving SMR efficiencies

A first step for reducing CO 2 emissions from SMR (or any process) is to improve the overall efficiency. One example of a new-generation SMR developed by Air Liquide Engineering & Construction (Frankfurt, Germany; www.engineering-airliquide.com) is SMR-X technology. SMR-X is a new type of reformer that produces H 2 without excess steam, a byproduct that is declining in demand from users. Compared to conventional steam methane reforming, SMR-X features higher thermal efficiency at low steam co-production ratios and emits less CO 2 .

Some of the notable advantages of this next-generation reforming technology are increases in the overall yield of the H 2 production process by roughly 5%, together with an intrinsic reduction of CO 2 emissions (pre-capture) of 5%, making it a reforming process with a significantly reduced carbon footprint.

In combination with Air Liquide’s CO 2 -capture technologies, like Cryocap, the SMR-X technology route can provide the lowest carbon intensities and highest conversion efficiencies, making it a key pillar for the energy transition and decarbonization projects, unlocking attractive H 2 routes for small- and medium-production capacities, says the company.

Air Liquide has been operating an industrial-scale plant (Figure 1) with this technology in Antwerp, Belgium since April 2021 and is said to be the first industrial-size greenfield recuperative-reforming plant in the world. The SMR-X technology is currently selected in many ongoing low-carbon H 2 concept and technology studies, as well as projects advancing to the front-end engineering and design (FEED) stage.

Catalyst developments are also leading to improved SMR efficiencies. For example, BASF SE (Ludwigshafen, Germany; www.basf.com) developed the Synspire G1-110 catalyst, which reduces the steam demand for SMR (steam-to-carbon ratio down to 1.5) and maximizing the utilization of CO 2 . BASF’s new formulation is said to increase the coking resistance of the catalyst. Compared to standard SMR processes, the new catalyst can save up to 5% of operating costs, up to 3% of investment costs and decrease the CO 2 emission of the process by up to 13% by reducing demand for fuel, steam and electricity, BASF says.

Last month, BASF began construction on its syngas plant at the Verbund site in Zhanjiang, China. Scheduled to start up in 2025, the new plant will produce syngas and H 2 using “unique process concepts” to reduce CO 2 emissions, compared to conventional syngas plants, the company says.

Meanwhile, Clariant (Pratteln, Switzerland; www.clariant.com) recently introduced its new generation of ReforMax LDP Plus catalyst formulation (Figure 2) with high activity and 20% pressure-drop reduction. The reduced pressure-drop, without penalty on performance, leads to lower overall compression needs for the H 2 product gas and, hence appreciable energy savings, says Clariant Catalysts.

In addition, Technip Energies N.V. (T.EN; Zoetermeer, the Netherlands; www.technipenergies.com) and Clariant have introduced a new heat-recuperative reformer concept called enhanced annular reforming tube for hydrogen (EARTH, a tradename of T.EN) to improve the efficiency, capacity and sustainability of SMR. EARTH consists of an innovative concentric tubular structure and a tailor-made structured catalyst, which can be applied as a simple drop-in solution in existing or new reformer tubes. This unique setup results in superior heat recovery, higher throughput, and significantly lower pressure drop compared to conventional SMR.

EARTH can reduce CO 2 emissions by up to 10% and increase capacity by up to 20% compared to conventional SMR. EARTH has been successfully implemented at Ak-Kim’s syngas plant in Turkey, resulting in fuel savings of 38%, higher radiant efficiency, lower steam export, and 20% lower CO 2 emissions. With the addition of process and fluegas carbon capture and other synergistic design changes, such as increased reaction severity to maximize hydrocarbon conversion and supplemental hydrogen firing, a CO 2 footprint reduction of more than 99% is achievable, says Clariant Catalysts.

Clariant also notes that, in the case of fluegas carbon capture, recuperative reforming brings significant advantages, because it directly translates into a smaller energy consumption and capital investment for the carbon-capture unit.

By investing in R&D and performing fundamental studies of the different carrier systems and their properties, Topsoe A/S (Lyngby, Denmark; www.topsoe.com) developed a new and more robust carrier system, which forms the basis for its Titan series of steam-reforming catalysts.

The Titan series of SMR catalysts, launched in 2020, is said to offer improved performance and longer catalyst lifetime thanks to the hibonite-rich composition. Prior to the launch, selected users experienced benefits of the Titan series, including 8% reduction in pressure-drop and 25% higher catalytic activity when compared to conventional catalysts available on the market.

The hibonite-rich composition of the catalysts provides a remarkable performance boost, which becomes especially evident after long operation. The addition of titanium promoters adds exceptional mechanical strength while a seven-hole cylindrical shape yields both a very low pressure drop and a high surface area. The catalyst’s high activity and low pressure-drop leads to lower operating costs, increased profit margins and reduced energy usage, Topsoe says.

Meanwhile, “there has been an increase and more volatility in natural gas prices,” says Ken Chlapik, market manager, Low Carbon Solutions, Johnson Matthey plc (London, U.K.; www.matthey.com). “This has increased the interest in pre-reforming applications, for which Johnson Matthey has developed Katalco 65-3X. This catalyst provides the same feedstock flexibility as other pre-reforming catalysts, enabling it to operate with a range of feeds, including ROG [refinery offgas], natural gas, LPGs [liquefied petroleum gas] and naphthas, however the catalyst uses new proprietary promotors to provide enhanced thermal stability. This enables the retention of a high catalyst activity deeper into the operating cycle, thereby enabling plants to confidently move to longer changeout cycles.”

Also, because of higher natural gas prices, investment in new large plants has been scaled back and hence a shift to smaller projects including the revamp of existing units, Chlapik continues. “Structured catalysts, such as Catacel SSR, provide a perfect option for a low-cost means to improved efficiency and intensification of existing SMR. The structured form of Catacel SSR provides a step change in performance, where fundamental science limits further improvements in the design of randomly packed pellets. The structured catalyst is higher in voidage and GSA [geometrical surface area], thus providing a higher activity, but at a lower pressure drop. The catalyst is also designed to actively disrupt the boundary layer at the inner of the reformer catalyst tube by jetting the process gas towards it, thus increasing the heat transfer coefficient. Together these features have provided our customers a 15% performance/throughput benefit, as well as a 15% saving in required firing fuel over a full catalyst lifecycle,” says Chlapik (Catacel SSR technology was a finalist for the 2019 Kirkpatrick Chemical Engineering Achievement Award; see Chem. Eng., January 2020, pp. 23–26).

In a related development, Honeywell UOP LLC (Des Plains, Ill.; uop.honeywell.com) and ZoneFlow Reactor Technologies, LLC (ZFRT; Windsor, Conn.; zoneflowtech.com) successfully conducted pilot plant testing of the ZoneFlow Reactor (Figure 3) in ZFRT’s large-scale pilot plant at Université Catholique de Louvain in Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium. The near-commercial-level testing validated increased steam reforming capacity by at least 15% in terms of feed flow compared to conventional state-of-the-art pellets, with no higher methane slip and without increasing the maximum tube skin temperature or pressure drop. This increased production of hydrogen allows for the SMR to convert hydrocarbon feeds, such as natural gas or naphtha, and steam into syngas."

The Port of Rotterdam is decarbonizing



The Port of Rotterdam is the biggest in Europe, with an annual throughput of 467 million tonnes (in 2022), no less. The port is also Europe’s largest energy hub. Randolf Weterings is Program Manager Electrification & Hydrogen New Business at the port. He knows, more than anyone, the challenges of decarbonizing the port and energy hub.

Weterings, said:

The Port of Rotterdam is an important gateway for goods and energy coming in to northwest Europe.

“As an example, the port handles 13% of Europe’s total energy needs. The port itself is quite extensive, too. In an area 42 km long, and between 2 and 5 km wide there are some 3,000 companies. You could say that decarbonizing the whole thing is quite a challenge.”

Areas for decarbonization

“We started our practical planning for decarbonization in 2016, based on four concerns: efficiency and infrastructure, a new energy system, a new resource and fuel system, and sustainable transportation. On infrastructure, we want to make sure all the facilities are in place for decarbonization: a bigger and more robust electricity grid and sufficient hydrogen, CO 2 , heat, and steam networks.”

“The new energy system revolves around renewable energy sources, but also includes electrifying industry and expanding the hydrogen programme. We see hydrogen both as an energy source and as a building block for the raw materials transition. The great advantage of hydrogen from renewable sources, such as wind power, lies in the fact that the hydrogen is carbon-free and it’s also a means of transporting and storing renewable energy.”

“The new resource and fuel system is about building bio-based industries and establishing a circular economy. And sustainable transportation means using clean fuel for ships and trucks going to and from Rotterdam.”

Hydrogen: scaling up is the message

“Hydrogen is one of the building blocks crucial to decarbonization, so we’re looking to massively scale up its use. We’re talking about both low-carbon hydrogen and renewable hydrogen, because we can’t limit ourselves – certainly not in the short term – to just one or the other. We aim to be able to produce 0.6 million tonnes of climate-neutral hydrogen locally every year by 2030 and import a further 4 million tonnes a year on top of that.”

“In terms of our local production by 2030, we’re planning on half a million tonnes of low-carbon hydrogen and a quarter of a million tonnes of renewable hydrogen. We’ll get 0.2 million tonnes by capturing CO 2 emissions from existing hydrogen plants and storing it safely in underground gas fields. The Porthos Carbon Transport & Storage project is going to make that happen. In October 2023, Porthos made the final decision to invest in it and the first raw materials for Porthos construction have already been delivered. We expect it to be up and running in two years.”

“The remaining 0.3 million tonnes of low-carbon hydrogen are going to come from the H-Vision project: residual gases from industry, to be converted to hydrogen in the future.”

Renewable hydrogen

The quarter of a million tonnes of renewable hydrogen will be produced using electrolysers, located in a ‘conversion park’ in the Maasvlakte, where Air Liquide is planning to construct a 200 MW-capacity electrolyser.

“But, we’ve started building a second conversion park because we want to have between 2 and 2.5 gigawatt hydrogen capacity by 2030. We’re making the second conversion park site available to whichever party or consortium wins the IJmuiden Ver wind farm tender. The renewable electricity from the wind farm can then be used to produce renewable hydrogen on a large scale.”

“It’s impossible to produce renewable hydrogen using electrolysers without renewable electricity, which is why producers need this kind of power procurement contract. By the way, this approach is in line with the new European rules around renewable hydrogen. Not only that, it’s an efficient way to integrate wind power optimally into the energy system. And by planning hydrogen production on the coast, we avoid extra load on the high-voltage grid. That’s why the ministry encourages this approach.”

“We reckon on having around 20 to 25 gigawatts of green energy from offshore wind turbines available in Rotterdam by 2050 for the production of renewable hydrogen on-shore, or where the hydrogen is already produced on-site at the wind turbines themselves. That 20 to 25 gigawatts is also the maximum we can achieve initially, because we also need wind energy to replace coal-fired power plants, and we don’t have any space left to install more wind turbines. Given all the other activities in the North Sea, at some point it will just be full.”

Imports

In north-western Europe, we cannot generate enough renewable energy to produce the hydrogen we need, and so we have to import much of it anyway. For the Port of Rotterdam, we estimate some 18 million tonnes per year by 2050. To achieve this, the port is currently in talks with more than 20 countries. Aside from the geopolitical situation, the price of renewable energy is the decisive factor. As a rule, the price in countries with better solar and wind conditions is lower than here.

There are a number of long-distance hydrogen transport carriers, each with their strengths and weaknesses. But, given the short time left to meet the 2030 targets, we will have to rely mainly on ammonia until then, since the technology for this is already widely available. In the Port of Rotterdam, meanwhile, nine terminals have already announced that they will import hydrogen, and six have committed to ammonia.

“For renewable hydrogen produced within the EU, there’s now a certification system that means producers can prove that their hydrogen is 100% renewable. But for hydrogen imported from outside the EU, the certification schemes aren’t yet fully in alignment. But, the Hydrogen Council – the Port of Rotterdam Authority and Air Liquide are members – has already got initial agreement on this at the last COP28 climate summit.”

Infrastructure

In late 2023, Hynetwork Services (editor’s note: a subsidiary of Gasunie, the Dutch gas infrastructure company) put the first spade in the ground to build the national hydrogen network. Starting in 2030, this network should connect the main industrial regions of the Netherlands with each other, Belgium, and Germany. The first section could be commissioned as early as 2025, connecting the Maasvlakte to Pernis.

“We also need a more robust and better equipped electricity grid. That’s why Tennet, the grid operator, are building a new high-voltage substation, among other installations, on the Maasvlakte. This will assist the progress of all those large-scale offshore wind projects and the planned electrolysers.”

“Air Liquide is an important partner for us, partly because they’re a pioneer and an accelerating force making the port more sustainable, especially around hydrogen. Air Liquide operates several production units and the company has a lot of infrastructure. We anticipate that Air Liquide will also play a major role in importing and handling hydrogen. With their knowledge and experience, Air Liquide can also help other parties in the port make the switch to hydrogen.”

From talking the talk to walking the walk

“The time for just talk is thankfully over. There’s now a real move from talking to doing. You notice that once the government takes important decisions, things gain momentum.”

“When the Green Deal was first mooted, a number of key players took the decision early to start working with hydrogen. Air Liquide was one of those frontrunners. They knew then that hydrogen is necessary for decarbonization and so they built up a healthy lead.”

The dispute pertains to a 2010 supply contract that the CPSE had entered into with Air Liquide for the “supply of oxygen, nitrogen gases, and liquid primarily for captive consumption” of RINL.

Air Liquide, in a letter to the French Embassy (copy with businessline) in January, claimed it installed the cryogenic air separation unit to meet the need for industrial gases required for metal production through blast furnaces. However, commissioning was not carried out and failure to resolve differences stalled the commissioning. Since the contract was terminated in 2014, it was ultimately referred to arbitration tribunal.

The French company claimed that it continued to carry out directions given to it by the Tribunal which included having various performance tests, health checks “on all equipment”, refurbishing and replacing some. Covid and the delayed commissioning of the third blast furnace delayed operationalising the air separation unit.

Alternatively, Air Liquide has offered a “mutual settlement” proposal which, according to an official of the Steel Ministry, is yet to be accepted by the RINL board.

The settlement talks of takeover terms (of the unit by RINL) so as to enable revival of the third blast furnace.

In its letter to the Embassy, Air Liquide, said, the dispute “has significantly affected Air Liquide India Holdings’ financial health”. “This dispute has also strained Air Liquide proactiveness to invest (here),” it said.

The company said it invested close to €72.4 million (close to ₹700 crore) in the last 14 years.

The French Ambassador in his letter said a joint solution is being preferred and this will allow “for revival plan of RINL to be initiated as soon as possible with the starting of their third blast furnace”.

Subsequently, earlier this month, Air Liquide reached out to the Ministry proposing a meeting with senior management of the company (and ministry officials). The participants included CEO – Africa, Middle East and India Hub, MD of the India arm and a representative of the Embassy.

“BOC is prioritising supply for critical medical, safety and water treatment customers,” the British multinational said in a statement.

“We are working collaboratively with customers, our CO2 suppliers and other industry stakeholders to manage the situation.”

The other major supplier, French company Air Liquide, said the it is facing a major disruption in Australia, particularly NSW, as a “result of a planned maintenance shutdown” at one of its source locations.

“Air Liquide planned for this anticipated disruption and to date has minimised impact to its customers. Nonetheless, the CO2 situation remains tight, and Air Liquide continues to monitor and manage its storage and supply chain,” the firm said.

Even shop hopping will not solve the issue for consumers, with several major chains feeling the crunch.

About 20 Woolworths-branded soft drinks are currently in short supply.

“Shortages of CO2 have impacted the supply of some soft drinks in our stores,” a spokesperson for the company said.

“We are working to manage these impacts and a number of alternative products are available to customers while these shortages continue.”

Coles has placed signs on shelves at impacted stores to keep customers informed about the low levels of stock.

“We are working with our suppliers to minimise the impacts for our customers and we hope to have products back on our shelves as soon as possible,” a Coles spokesperson said.

“In the meantime, we have increased our stock of alternative drinks.”

7NEWS.com.au understands German discount chain Aldi is also in talks with its partners to manage levels of their affected drinks before availability returns to normal.

It is unclear when CO2 supplies will be topped up and shelves re-stocked as they usually are.

A spokesperson for the Australian Beverages Council told 7NEWS.com.au they expected the shortage to be “felt on shelves around the country for some time” but that the industry is working hard to restore stock.

Customers have been scrambling to secure their favourite drinks amid major supply troubles. Credit: Amy Sinclair

Frustrated consumers searched for answers on internet forums when their favourite drinks were nowhere to be found, with some even wondering if home brand beverages had been discontinued.

“Why are home brand sugar-free drinks so hard to buy? Woolworths, Aldi and Coles seem to be the same story. No sugar-free home brand drinks on the shelf, one person posted on Reddit.

Another said home brand products were first to face the chop during production issues because they are the least profitable.

BOC said it is committed to increasing CO2 reliability and supply for customers.

“This includes building a new CO2 processing facility in Victoria, which is expected to be operational in the second half of 2024,” the company said.

“This facility will have the capacity to produce 60,000 tonnes of beverage-grade liquid CO2 annually.”

Beer supplies are not expected to be impacted by the current disruptions."

Three huge wind farms and a massive transmission line are set to be built in the Eastern Cape.

The Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) has been appointed as a co-mandated lead arranger alongside Absa and Nedbank to provide debt funding and BEE equity funding for three large-scale wind farms in the Eastern Cape.

The project will supply 330 MW to Sasol and Air Liquide’s operations in Secunda, Mpumalanga, under a 20-year Power Purchase Agreement.

The project’s sponsor is the Enel Green Power RSA and Perpetua Holdings consortium.

“We expect the projects to start operating in 2026 in order to contribute towards the energy supply constraints in the country,” said Lungile Tom, Acting Head of Project Finance at the DBSA.

Sasol previously said that the 330 MW of renewable energy will be produced close to Oyster Bay in the Eastern Cape and will be one of the largest wind-powered facilities in Southern Africa.

Despite the Eastern Cape’s massive wind potential, the lack of transmission infrastructure has often been highlighted as a major hindrance to the adaption of renewable energies in a country that relies on unreliable and dangerous coal-fired power stations.

The project’s expenditure thus includes the construction of a transmission line of 120 kilometres.

“This is commendable considering the need to unlock transmission and distribution infrastructure, which is severely constrained according to Eskom’s latest Generation Connection Capacity Assessment report,” said DBSA.

Advancement in Technology Foreseen to Drive the Global Gasification Market from 2023 to 2032

Gasification reduces reliance on fossil fuels, diversifying energy sources for mobility fuels, heat, and power. This enhances energy security and creates growth opportunities.” — Allied Market Research

WILMINGTON, DELAWARE, UNITED STATES, March 27, 2024 /EINPresswire.com/ -- The rising global energy demand, along with the need for cleaner and more efficient energy sources, is a significant driver of the gasification market. Gasification offers a versatile method of converting various feedstocks, such as coal, biomass, and municipal waste, into a range of useful products, including electricity, synthetic natural gas, and liquid fuels. The global gasification market size was valued at $472.20 billion in 2022 and is estimated to reach $836.6 billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 5.7% from 2023 to 2032.

𝐃𝐨𝐰𝐧𝐥𝐨𝐚𝐝 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡 𝐑𝐞𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭 𝐒𝐚𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞 & 𝐓𝐎𝐂: https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/932

Gasification is a process that converts carbonaceous materials, such as coal, biomass, or municipal solid waste, into a gaseous fuel called syngas (synthetic gas). It involves heating the feedstock at high temperatures in an oxygen-limited environment, resulting in the partial oxidation of the material. During gasification, the carbonaceous material reacts with a controlled amount of oxygen or steam, producing a mixture of gases composed mainly of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen (H2), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and other trace gases. The ratio of oxygen to carbon is carefully regulated to achieve the desired composition of the syngas.

An increase in greenhouse gas emissions, a rise in the use of environmentally friendly energy sources, and a rise in public concern for the environment are the key factors driving the market growth. Increasing environmental regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable development have led to a greater emphasis on cleaner energy technologies. Gasification helps to mitigate environmental concerns by enabling the capture and utilization of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and reducing dependence on fossil fuels. Through the process, corrosive ash components like chlorides and potassium, which can cause a number of issues in the feedstock, are refined to produce clean gas. In addition, the popularity of gasifying fossil fuels for generating electricity at the residential and industrial levels is rising. Technological advancements in syngas production and reduction of costs are playing an important role in shifting industry preferences toward a responsive and clean source of electricity. These factors are anticipated to have a positive impact on the gasification market forecast.

The gasification market requires significant upfront investment and operational costs. The capital expenditure involved in building gasification plants, implementing carbon capture and storage, and ensuring compliance with environmental regulations can be significant. The high costs associated with gasification can pose a barrier to its widespread adoption, particularly in regions where alternative energy sources are cheaper. In addition, competition for feedstock resources from other industries, such as the agricultural or bioenergy sectors, can further restrict its availability.
