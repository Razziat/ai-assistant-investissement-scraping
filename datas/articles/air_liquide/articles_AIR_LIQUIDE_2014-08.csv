Linde Completes Coldbox Installations At Major Plant Site In Texas - Chemical Online.com,"Thu, 28 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZW1pY2Fsb25saW5lLmNvbS9kb2MvbGluZGUtY29tcGxldGVzLWNvbGRib3gtaW5zdGFsbGF0aW9ucy1hdC1tYWpvci1wbGFudC1zaXRlLWluLXRleGFzLTAwMDHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Murray HILL and New Providence, NJ PRNewswire/ - Linde has completed installation of three coldboxes which are the centerpiece of its air separation unit under construction in La Porte, Texas. The ASU is part of more than $250 million Linde North Americais investing to build a state-of-the art air separation unit (ASU), a new gasification train and supporting equipment and facilities in La Porte.

""Installation of the three coldboxes at the site is a major milestone in the construction process,"" said Chuck Brooks, head of project execution, North America. ""The coldbox is the nerve center of the plant. It's where the cryogenic distillation of air takes place to separate the major components of the air – oxygen, nitrogen and argon."" The coldbox contains all the equipment needed for the separation process -- heat exchangers, distillation columns and associated valves and piping, all of which are heavily insulated.

""The coldboxes, two of which are about 20 stories high, had an interesting journey to the installation site -- a journey that required remarkable engineering design and execution,"" said Brooks. The heat exchangers and columns were fabricated at Linde shops in Schalchen, Germany, and trucked to Bremen where the coldboxes were fabricated. The boxes were then shipped to Houston where they were transferred to barges.

The coldboxes arrived by barge which required dredging of a channel and construction of a ramp for a tracked vehicle to move them from the barge to the plant site. Ramp construction began with driving pilings to underpin the ramp because it needed the ability to safely support the weight of the coldboxes. Once off the barge and onto the remote-control operated tracked vehicle, the coldboxes inched their way to the site.

""Linde engineers ensured the safety of the project every step of the way,"" Brooks said.

When fully on-stream in early 2015, the ASU will be the largest operated by Linde in the U.S. Linde is also adding a new gasification unit and supporting modifications to the world's largest gas-based partial oxidation complex for the production of syngas products for petrochemicals.

The oxygen and nitrogen produced by the new ASU will supply the gasification assets at the La Porte site. The new gasifier will convert natural gas into syngas and constituent products such as carbon monoxide, hydrogen and carbon dioxide which are used to produce methanol, downstream chemicals and cleaner transportation fuels. The syngas products will be shipped by pipeline to key customers. Linde also owns and operates three additional large, partial oxidation facilities that manufacture syngas products using Linde's world-leading syngas processing technologies and know-how.

Linde North America is a member of The Linde Group, a world leading gases and engineering company. In the 2013 financial year, The Linde Group generated revenue of $23.1 billion (EUR 16.655 bn), making it the largest gases and engineering company in the world with approximately 63,500 employees working in more than 100 countries worldwide. The strategy of The Linde Group is geared towards long-term profitable growth and focuses on the expansion of its international business with forward-looking products and services. Linde acts responsibly towards its shareholders, business partners, employees, society and the environment – in every one of its business areas, regions and locations across the globe.

Hafnium. Ruthenium. Tantalum. Zirconium. Now cobalt can be added to that list.

As the semiconductor industry tries to uphold Moore’s law—Gordon Moore’s 1965 prediction that the number of transistors in a computer chip will double every two years—silicon is no longer its only significant chip-making material. These days the industry is reaching deep into the periodic table for the ingredients needed to fabricate its most advanced chips.

Cobalt is the latest element to be tapped. Applied Materials, a major manufacturer of chip fabrication equipment, is working with its electronics industry customers to incorporate thin cobalt films into semiconductor architecture. And behind the scenes, several chemical companies are jockeying to supply the organometallic precursors needed to make cobalt happen.

Like hafnium oxide in transistors and tantalum nitride in barrier layers, cobalt is being added to the chip fabrication regimen to make the devices work at increasingly tiny dimensions.

In the semiconductor industry’s early days, circuit lines were made on a silicon wafer by etching trenches into a layer of silicon dioxide and filling them with aluminum metal. But as line widths shrank, aluminum’s shortcomings as a conductor became apparent. In 1997, IBM pioneered the switch away from aluminum to copper interconnects.

It wasn’t an easy swap. A dielectric material that insulates better than silicon dioxide was needed. Then, a thin barrier layer of tantalum nitride plus a liner of tantalum had to be applied to the trenches to keep the copper from diffusing into the dielectric.

And to apply copper to the wafer, materials scientists had to develop a new electrodeposition technique because the etching process used with aluminum didn’t work. The new method had two steps: deposition of a thin seed layer of copper to make sure the trench walls were completely covered and then a more complete copper electrodeposition.

With those modifications in place, copper faithfully did its job for many years. At the time it was introduced, circuit lines were 220 nm wide. But today, as circuitry has shrunk to widths of 22 nm and below, new problems are emerging for copper.

A big one, explains David Thompson, Applied Materials’ technology director for process chemistries, is electromigration. Running electric current—electrons—through the ultrathin wires can dislocate copper ions, creating voids in the circuit and opening the door to chip failure.

Applied Materials says it has ensured copper’s role for several more chip generations by adapting its Endura Volta deposition equipment to apply a less than 20-Å film of cobalt metal, instead of the tantalum liner, via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of an organocobalt precursor. The company calls the introduction of cobalt “the most significant materials change to the interconnect in over 15 years.”

Cobalt, the firm’s chemists found, provides better “wetting” of copper than tantalum does. As a result, copper adheres better to the sides of the trenches, minimizing later electromigration.

Thompson is particularly proud of part two of his firm’s cobalt system: a cobalt cap that is deposited selectively over the copper circuit lines, effectively encasing them in a sleeve of cobalt. That step, the company says, represents the first commercially significant use of selective metal chemistry in semiconductor manufacturing.

Why cobalt and not some other material? “The comical answer,” Thompson says, “is ‘because it works.’ ” Elements such as manganese and ruthenium were tested, but cobalt prevailed when it came to low interaction with other materials and robustness in the face of subsequent chip cleaning, polishing, and etching steps.

Although Applied Materials publicly revealed the cobalt system in May, the company says it has been working with the metal for close to a decade. To date, the firm has shipped more than 75 cobalt CVD chambers for use in high-volume manufacturing of chips with sub-22-nm circuitry.

Thompson won’t disclose much about the cobalt precursors used other than to say different chemistries are used for the liner and cap steps. Information about the firms that Applied Materials qualified to supply the chemicals is also proprietary, he says.

But cobalt is definitely a big deal for materials suppliers, confirms Mike Corbett, an analyst with the electronics materials advisory firm Linx Consulting. “This is really the first new element to be integrated into the interconnect in a long while,” he says.

Business opportunity exists both for organometallic chemical specialists, such as Sigma-Aldrich and Digital Specialty Chemicals (DSC), and for industrial gas companies such as Air Liquide and Air Products & Chemicals.

The gases firms traditionally set up facilities inside semiconductor plants that supply both their own gases and chemicals mostly made by other companies. Supply lines are starting to blur, however.

Air Products has been investing in thin-film material capabilities. And last year, Air Liquide acquired Voltaix, a New Jersey-based company that brought high-volume precursor manufacturing capacity.

Given that Applied Materials is targeting cobalt at chips with circuitry of less than 22 nm, the semiconductor giant Intel is probably the only firm currently using it in large volumes, Corbett figures. But companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which makes chips for third parties under contract, are likely close behind.

The market is already growing. In response to demand from the semiconductor industry, Toronto-based DSC has scaled up production of organocobalt precursors. DSC declines to be more specific about its cobalt line, but a company newsletter indicates that it is manufacturing at least two precursors: cyclopentadienylcobalt dicarbonyl and dicobalt hexacarbonyl tert-butylacetylene.

Manufacturing organometallic precursors isn’t for the faint of heart, cautions Ravi K. Laxman, DSC’s vice president for electronics. Cobalt-containing compounds, for example, tend to be light sensitive, so reactions at DSC’s plant in Toronto have to be carried out in complete darkness.

“If you are making 5 or 10 g at the bench scale, you can just turn off the lights and put a shield around it,” he says. “But when you start manufacturing 10, 50, or 100 kg, it becomes a little challenging to do in the dark.”

DSC also sees an opportunity to help customers deposit tantalum nitride using pentakis(dimethylamino) tantalum (PDMAT), a precursor the firm is now producing at commercial scale. Tantalum nitride is usually applied via physical vapor deposition (PVD) of tantalum metal, but at the tight geometries of sub-22-nm chips, PVD can cause bulges in the circuit trench that inhibit subsequent deposition of copper.

PDMAT, in contrast, can be applied with atomic layer deposition (ALD), a CVD method that deposits smooth films one atomic layer at a time. On its own or with cobalt, ALD-applied tantalum nitride can reduce electromigration and help preserve copper’s low resistivity, according to Laxman.

But synthesizing PDMAT, a solid at room temperature, presents its own challenges, Laxman says. Trace amounts of oxygen can cause tantalum to behave like a capacitor rather than a barrier, so DSC developed a series of purification steps to yield a PDMAT that is more than 99.99995% pure.

Laxman notes that chip fabrication plants are not necessarily making a choice between cobalt and tantalum. “As you go below 22 nm, every fab is adapting different materials,” he says. Some firms may even decide to use a cobalt precursor on some circuitry levels and PDMAT on others. “We see a tremendous amount of growth happening for all of them,” Laxman adds.

Indeed, Linx’s Corbett estimates that the cobalt precursors business is already worth tens of millions of dollars per year. As more chip makers adopt cobalt as a companion to copper, volumes will rise, although prices will also come down. On balance, Corbett expects that the market “could be a $75 million opportunity.”

At the same time, semiconductor engineers who become comfortable with cobalt will start to explore the metal for other applications in the chip-making process. “We expect to see more and more cobalt ALD and CVD going forward,” Corbett says."

HPCL eyes tie-up with Reliance to expand oil retailing biz - BusinessLine,"Sun, 24 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1YnVzaW5lc3NsaW5lLmNvbS9jb21wYW5pZXMvaHBjbC1leWVzLXRpZS11cC13aXRoLXJlbGlhbmNlLXRvLWV4cGFuZC1vaWwtcmV0YWlsaW5nLWJpei9hcnRpY2xlNjQyMTU5MzAuZWNl0gGCAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1YnVzaW5lc3NsaW5lLmNvbS9jb21wYW5pZXMvaHBjbC1leWVzLXRpZS11cC13aXRoLXJlbGlhbmNlLXRvLWV4cGFuZC1vaWwtcmV0YWlsaW5nLWJpei9hcnRpY2xlNjQyMTU5MzAuZWNlL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"State-owned oil marketing company Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd is looking at a possible tie-up with Reliance Industries Ltd to expand its oil retailing business.

With retail diesel prices inching towards market rates, and petrol already de-regulated, the oil retailers are now reviewing their business strategies.

HPCL is keen to expand its retailing operations, while Reliance Industries, having burnt its fingers earlier, wants to reduce its risks.

Reliance Industries, led by Mukesh Ambani, maintained that it is always looking for business opportunities, while HPCL termed the move “very preliminary”.

An official in the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas said: “What we understand is that HPCL is doing due diligence. A final call will be taken subsequently”.

This is not for the first time that Reliance Industries has been in talks with a PSU oil retailer. In 2009, too, it had held parleys for a joint venture. Reliance’s move was triggered by the Government’s control over auto fuel pricing, which is distorting the economics of the company’s business.

Today, only about 200-215 Reliance Industries retail outlets are operational, mainly in Gujarat. But the company had to shut down 1,400 retail outlets. Investments worth ₹5,000 crore are stuck in Reliance Industries’ existing infrastructure.

While the PSU retailers are compensated by the Government for selling fuel at a controlled price, there is no such mechanism for private players.

The Government had decided to stagger the increase in diesel prices by about 50 paise a litre every month. Currently, the under-recovery on diesel is ₹1.78 a litre.

The staggered hike has also busted the myth that the increase in cost would impact industrial and retail consumption. Diesel demand for July actually registered a 6.25 per cent increase, year on year.

According to the Ministry, diesel has a weightage of 4.67 in the wholesale price index — for every ₹1 increase in the diesel price, the WPI index is estimated to rise by 0.09 per cent.

Despite talks of possible decontrol, players such as Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, Essar Oil and Shell are still being cautious, as the issue of diesel pricing — whether de-controlled or not — has political implications.

Companies having more retail outlets will be at an advantage. HPCL is the second-largest retailer in the country and a deal with Reliance Industries will cement its position further.

Essar Oil, which has 1,400 operational outlets, with another 300 in various stages of commissioning, plans to have 3,000 outlets in place in the next 3-4 years. Shell has just 78 operational outlets.

The narrowing price difference between petrol and diesel will also widen the choice for vehicle owners as well.

“Demand for petrol cars may rise in future due to the narrowing price difference between petrol and diesel. The demand difference between petrol and diesel variants may become 50:50 in near future from around 35:65 now,” said Ranjit Yadav, President, Passenger Vehicles Business Unit, Tata Motors.

Greenpeace denounces the sale of 3000 m3 of illegal logging in Cameroon - Business in Cameroon,"Tue, 26 Aug 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luY2FtZXJvb24uY29tL2FncmljdWx0dXJlLzI2MDgtNDk5OS1ncmVlbnBlYWNlLWRlbm91bmNlcy10aGUtc2FsZS1vZi0zLTAwMC1tMy1vZi1pbGxlZ2FsLWxvZ2dpbmctaW4tY2FtZXJvb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Business in Cameroon) - The international NGO, Greenpeace, announced on August 20, 20145, that a cargo of 3,000 m3 of illegally cut timber from Cameroon left the port of Douala for the Chinese port of Zhangjiagang. The incident involved a portion of the 10,000 m3 of timber illegally cut by Uniprovince, a Herakles Farms company, which recently received a land concession in South-West region of Cameroon for oil palm farming.

While it has never stopped speaking out against this project, not only about Herakles Farms commencing logging activity without receiving a land concession to do so, but also because of the negative effect the project has on the environment and the well-being of the local population, Greenpeace revealed in a May 27, 2014 press release that “the American company Herakles Farms, through a front company, allegedly schemed with the Cameroonian Minister of Forestry to illegally acquire a woodcutting permit as a part of a land concession granted in November 2013. Herakles Farms is preparing to export wood cut in violation of Cameroonian law to China.”

According to Greenpeace, these fears have been realised based on “official documents from the port of Douala”. “It was with little surprise that we learned that this lumber is being shipped to China despite all the proofs of its illegality,” stated Irene Wabiwa, head of Greenpeace’s forest preservation campaign in Africa.

She goes on to add that “three Cameroonian State attorneys general have received information proving the unlawfulness of Uniprovince’s wood cutting activity, but nothing, to our knowledge, has been done about it. The Forestry Ministry and the EU responsible for the implementation of the FLEGT partnership agreement, were also informed several times. But unfortunately, this did not prevent the wood from being exported.”

The Greenpeace local representative also adds that “if this activity continues with complete impunity, it will demolish the credibility of the FLEGT partnership agreement ratified in December 2011, thus accelerating the destruction of the forest and depriving communities of their means of subsistence.”"
