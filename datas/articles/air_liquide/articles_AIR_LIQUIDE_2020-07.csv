"Supercritical CO₂: cleaner, safer and more competitive - Air Liquide","Thu, 09 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvaW5kdXN0cnkvc3VwZXJjcml0aWNhbC1jbzItY2xlYW5lci1zYWZlci1hbmQtbW9yZS1jb21wZXRpdGl2ZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide and the US-based company Fusion Coolant Systems have partnered to provide a breakthrough innovation for the machining industry based on supercritical CO 2 .Totally unique on the market, the “Pure Cut” solution enhances performance, productivity, worker safety and sustainability.

Always on the lookout for innovative technologies, Air Liquide sees the supercritical CO 2 “Pure Cut” solution developed by Fusion Coolant Systems as a game-changer in the machining sector. In a unique promotion partnership, each company promotes the other to potential customers.

What is supercritical CO 2 ?







A supercritical fluid is a substance held at a temperature and pressure above its critical point, in a ‘fourth’ phase: not a distinct solid, liquid or gas, but with properties between a gas and a liquid. Carbon dioxide becomes supercritical at a pressure of 74 bars and a temperature of 31°C, a phase in which it can pass through solids like a gas, but dissolve materials like a liquid. This makes supercritical CO2 an effective solvent that is currently used in a variety of applications, from the decaffeination of coffee beans through the production of essential oils and pharmaceuticals to the cleaning of microprocessors. Its properties also make it a cutting-edge new cooling and lubrication solution for machine tooling.

Going supercritical

In machining – cutting raw materials into parts of a specific shape and size – heat management is critical. High temperatures due to friction during cutting are a principal cause of tool failure, can slow cutting speeds, and can cause imperfections in the finished product. A range of coolant options exist, including traditional oil-based lubricants, oil and water emulsions and, more recently, cryogenic solutions such as liquid nitrogen and liquid carbon dioxide, all of which have trade-offs.

In 2003, Steven Skerlos, who is today Chief Technology Officer of Fusion Coolant Systems, was looking for cleaner machining solutions and had the brainstorm that supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO 2 ) would be an ideal cutting fluid. When he started testing the idea, he was surprised to find that not only was the solution cleaner, it actually improved operational performance. “The supercritical state means nano-sized droplets can get into the cutting area in a way that other solutions can’t, in a more consistent stream, and without damaging the spindle, tool or workpiece,” he explains.

After over a decade of development, he launched ""Pure Cut"", a patented sCO 2 -based cooling technology that can be used for any type of material – metals, carbon fibre, reinforced plastic, polyethylene – and can be easily integrated into existing machining systems.

A pure advantage

A world first, “Pure Cut” offers a number of benefits. The higher lubricity and cooling sCO 2 provides allows higher productivity: depending on the material and process, it can increase machining speed by two to five times. The same properties also protect expensive cutting tools, extending their life by up to three times. Additionally, the quality of the machined parts is improved, as sCO 2 enables a more precise surface finish.

Super-sustainable

The ""Pure Cut"" solution also has considerable benefits for workers and the environment. “As sCO 2 inherently provides lubricity, it allows zero or minimal amounts of regular lubricants to be used in machining – and if lubricants are used, they are dissolved in the sCO 2 ,” continues Steve Skerlos. For workers, this means no exposure to lubricants on the floor, in the air, or in contact with the skin, eliminating health concerns linked to traditional cutting fluids. It also means clean, oil-free waste chips that can be recycled more easily, and no polluted wastewater to treat. Air Liquide is also committed with its customers to working towards a clean and sustainable industry by proposing technologies which allow them to reduce or reuse their CO 2 emissions. As such, the CO 2 is recycled from other industrial processes and purified to give it a second life. The technology offers industry a sustainable, low waste alternative to traditional machining practices.

Partners in green machining

Convinced of Pure Cut’s promise, in 2020 Air Liquide signed a partnership with Fusion Coolant Systems in which each company will approach potential customers to offer this new technology in a comprehensive package. Jean-Marie Padovani, Director of Innovation Projects for the Industrial Merchant activities at Air Liquide during the signing phase, says: “This extends our portfolio with a pioneering solution that improves operating performance and reduces environmental impact for industries that represent a new market for us.”"

Several partners representing the whole supply chain, from truck manufacturers such as VDL Groep, Iveco/Nikola to transport companies Vos Logistics, Jongeneel Transport and HN Post, as well as leading fuel cell suppliers have already agreed to join. This is one of the largest projects in Europe for the development of hydrogen trucks and related infrastructure and will contribute to improve air quality by reducing by an estimated amount of more than 100,000 tonnes CO2 emissions per year, which is equivalent to 110 million kilometers driven.

In order to have 1,000 Hydrogen-powered trucks on the road, out of which 500 are expected to be based in the Port of Rotterdam area, the related infrastructure needs to be developed and deployed, which envisages 25 high capacity hydrogen stations to connect the Netherlands, Belgium, and western Germany. The project also aims to include the necessary electrolysis capacity to produce low carbon hydrogen. The companies represented in the initiative will jointly perform the feasibility study of this whole value chain.

To date, the project counts partners with complementary expertise, including hydrogen production, distribution through filling stations, truck manufacturers, transport companies, and fuel cell manufacturers for heavy-duty applications. Air Liquide and the Port of Rotterdam expect as well as invite more parties to join this initiative in the coming months. Together they will contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions of road transportation with hydrogen as a clean and sustainable alternative energy carrier. The final investment decision by the project partners is expected at the end of 2022.

Hydrogen is one of the energy sources that constitutes a solution to meet the challenge of clean transportation. It enables the reduction of greenhouse gases, pollution in cities and dependency on fossil fuels. It is particularly suited for intensively used heavy duty vehicles.

Air Liquide plans Sasol separator purchase - News for the Energy Sector - Energy Voice,"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZXJneXZvaWNlLmNvbS9vaWxhbmRnYXMvYWZyaWNhLzI1NjAxNi9zYXNvbC1haXItbGlxdWlkZS1zZWN1bmRhL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sasol has struck an exclusive negotiations agreement on the sale of its 16 air separation units to Air Liquide.

The South African company said proceeds from the sale were expected to be around 8.5 billion rand ($506 million). Sasol South Africa has signed the deal with Air Liquide Large Industries South Africa Proprietary.

The air separation units are located at Secunda. The facilities can process 42,000 tonnes per day. Air Liquide described the facility as the world’s largest oxygen production site. The company would launch a multi-year plan to modernise facilities, should the sale be completed.

Air Liquide will provide gases to Sasol’s operations under a long-term supply agreement. Sasol said Air Liquide’s expertise would drive a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. This will help bring down the overall Secunda emissions.

The purchaser said it was planning to reduce CO2 emissions at the site by 30-40%.

The buyer already owns the 17th air separation unit at the Secunda site. Air Liquide commissioned this in January 2018. It also built and sold the other 16 units to Sasol.

“Climate action is at the heart of Air Liquide’s growth strategy and our climate objectives are the most ambitious of our sector. Our capacity for intervention is wide and goes from renewable energy based hydrogen or oxygen production to energy efficiency programs on existing sites,” said Air Liquide’s chairman and CEO Benoît Potier.

“Solutions exist and we will continue to champion these worldwide. Now is the time to act.”

Sasol’s president and CEO Fleetwood Grobler said the deal was more than a business transaction. We welcome Air Liquide as one of our partners in our decarbonisation journey and we are pleased to continue and strengthen our longstanding association with them.”

Hurdles

The deal is subject to due diligence and various other agreements, including from the Competition Commission and the South African Reserve Bank. The two companies aim to reach a final agreement by mid-August and close the sale in the 2021 financial year.

Sasol plans to release a trading statement in early August.

The South African chemicals company reiterated previous warnings to shareholders. Sasol is working on various strategies to save cash and sell off assets, it said, and shareholders should “continue exercising caution”."
European hydrogen corridor for 1000 fuel cell trucks - www.electrive.com,"Sun, 12 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsZWN0cml2ZS5jb20vMjAyMC8wNy8xMi9ldXJvcGVhbi1oeWRyb2dlbi1jb3JyaWRvci1mb3ItMTAwMC1mdWVsLWNlbGwtdHJ1Y2tzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Initiated by the Port of Rotterdam Authority and AirLiquide, several European companies have joined forces to provide a hydrogen corridor for fuel cell trucks in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. They target 1,000 trucks by 2025.

AirLiquide and the port of Rotterdam consider this “one of the largest projects in Europe for the development of hydrogen trucks and related infrastructure”. In their communication, they already name “several partners from the supply chain” have joined the initiative. These include the Dutch VDL Group as well as Iveco and the US start-up Nikola for delivering the fuel cell trucks. Logistics companies such as Vos Logistics, Jongeneel Transport and HN Post are also involved. Besides, “leading fuel cell suppliers have already agreed to join,” said the initiators but fail to specify the latter individually.

To start with, the partners will do a feasibility study of the whole value chain envisioned by the project. This includes setting up an electrolysis capacity to produce low carbon hydrogen. The port authority further suggests that to have 1,000 hydrogen-powered trucks on the road, they will need 25 high capacity hydrogen stations to connect the Netherlands, Belgium, and West Germany. The port of Rotterdam expects that about 500 trucks will start from the port city and distribute the goods delivered there.

In this way, the port wants to secure its future business model by ensuring that transport meets the EU’s and companies’ sustainability criteria before others establish clean distribution routes. “With this coalition of partners that complement one another, we can give zero-emission road transport a boost,” says Allard Castelein, CEO of the Port of Rotterdam, for example.

But the expansion of the corridors has not yet been decided. According to the Port of Rotterdam and Air Liquide, they invite other companies to join the initiative in the coming months. The investment decision will be made at the end of 2022 at the earliest.

However, it is not the first project Rotterdam and AirLiquide are involved in. Together with political players, they are working the RH₂INE project that stands for ‘Rhine Hydrogen Integration Network of Excellence’. It involves seventeen partners along the so-called Rhine-Alps corridor stretching from Rotterdam to Genoa which they want to turn into a purely hydrogen-based transport route – by water, road and rail.

Besides, the European continent has seen other projects involving fuel cell trucks coming underway: Earlier this week, Hyundai delivered the first ten fuel cell trucks to Switzerland. By 2025, this figure is expected to rise to 1,600 vehicles. Various partners along the value chain are also involved in the project there.

Also this week the EU Commission had presented its first hydrogen strategy. Brussels primarily wants to electrify traffic with batteries directly. Still, in sectors “where electrification is difficult”, the strategy promotes “renewable hydrogen as well as sustainable biofuels and biogas”.

Sasol to sell world's biggest oxygen production site to Air Liquide | African Mining Market - African Mining Market,"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vYWZyaWNhbm1pbmluZ21hcmtldC5jb20vc2Fzb2wtdG8tc2VsbC13b3JsZHMtYmlnZ2VzdC1veHlnZW4tcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1zaXRlLXRvLWFpci1saXF1aWRlLzc2MDcv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly9hZnJpY2FubWluaW5nbWFya2V0LmNvbS9zYXNvbC10by1zZWxsLXdvcmxkcy1iaWdnZXN0LW94eWdlbi1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLXNpdGUtdG8tYWlyLWxpcXVpZGUvNzYwNy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sasol has agreed to sell the world’s biggest oxygen production site in Secunda, South Africa, to France’s Air Liquide for about 8.5 billion rand ($515 million), as it sheds assets to pay off debts and avoid a rights issue.

Sasol, the world’s biggest producer of motor fuel from coal, said on Wednesday it had reached an agreement to sell the 16 air separation units, which have a capacity of 42,000 tons per day and produce oxygen for its fuels and chemicals production processes as well as other gases.

The move is part of Sasol’s drive to sell off assets amid the coronavirus crisis and oil price slump, which have left the company – already struggling following problems at a massive chemicals project in the United States – potentially facing a rights issue of $2 billion.

Air Liquide, an industrial gases company that has been present at the site since 1979 and already owns and operates one other air separation unit, said it would launch a multi-year plan to modernise the facilities.

“(The transaction) will allow both Air Liquide and Sasol to focus on their core business, combining operational efficiency and reduction of CO2 emissions,” said Benoit Potier, chairman and CEO of Air Liquide, which will supply gases to Sasol if the transaction goes ahead.

Sasol added the companies were aiming to negotiate final agreements by mid-August, with the transaction expected to close within fiscal 2021.

The Port of Rotterdam Authority is the first port to join the Hydrogen Council, a global coalition of companies that seek to stimulate the use of hydrogen for energy transition.

The Hydrogen Council was founded in 2017 and currently has 92 members, mainly global companies active in the field of energy and transport, such as Air Liquide, Air Products, Aramco, BP, Shell, Vopak, BMW, CMA CGM, Daimler, GM and Toyota. Large banks and investment companies are also affiliated with the Hydrogen Council.

‘Policymakers, the business sector and investors worldwide consider hydrogen development indispensable for the recovery from the current economic downturn following the pandemic.

The recently announced European, German and Korean hydrogen plans are clear examples of this,’ said Benoît Potier, CEO of Air Liquide and co-chairman of the Hydrogen Council. ‘This point in time is decisive for energy production and consumption for at least one generation. The Hydrogen Council companies recognise that we have arrived at a critical time to accelerate clean energy development to achieve climate goals. Hydrogen is of the utmost importance in achieving this.’

Allard Castelein, CEO of the Port of Rotterdam Authority: ‘Hydrogen is the energy carrier of the 21st century. The hydrogen economy is currently rapidly emerging in Rotterdam through the development of a number of projects. As a member of the Hydrogen Council, we expect to be able to share our experiences, learn from others and help boost this climate-friendly fuel and raw material.’

Air Liquide signs a new long term contract with leading steel producer NLMK in Russia - Air Liquide,"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5haXJsaXF1aWRlLmNvbS9ncm91cC9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy1uZXdzLzIwMjAtMDctMTYvYWlyLWxpcXVpZGUtc2lnbnMtbmV3LWxvbmctdGVybS1jb250cmFjdC1sZWFkaW5nLXN0ZWVsLXByb2R1Y2VyLW5sbWstcnVzc2lh0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide and NLMK, a leading steel producer in Russia, have entered into a new long-term partnership. Under the agreement, Air Liquide will invest around 100 million euros in the flagship site of NLMK in Lipetsk, a combination of three projects which include the construction of a state-of-the-art Air Separation Unit (ASU), the acquisition of existing hydrogen unit for the steel plant and of the unit for Rare Gases production. This project also provides the base for growth of Air Liquide’s Industrial Merchant activity in one of the largest industrial Merchant markets in the Moscow region. Leveraging on new ways of working, the teams were able to finalize this new partnership digitally during the lock-down due to the Covid-19 pandemic crisis.

Air Liquide will design, build, own, and operate a new Air Separation Unit providing the highest industry standards in safety, efficiency and reliability. The unit with a production capacity of 1,000 tons of oxygen per day will be built on the Lipetsk site to increase steel production of the flagship site of NLMK. The Lipetsk site is among the top five most competitive sites in the world for slabs and hot-rolled coil production. Based on the latest energy efficiency technologies, the new Air Liquide unit will be contributing to the increased cost competitiveness of the site. The start-up of the unit is expected in 2023. Under the partnership, Air Liquide will also take over in the coming months all the assets for the production of hydrogen and rare gases at the NLMK site.

This contract, finalized digitally in the midst of Covid crisis, highlights the ability of the two companies to move forward despite the environment. This long-term partnership with NLMK strengthens Air Liquide's position in Russia and illustrates the company's strategy development in major industrial sites. In addition, this project provides momentum for growth in one of the largest Industrial Merchant markets in the Moscow region representing 30% of the country and reliable sourcing of Rare Gases for Air Liquide customers worldwide.

Air Liquide invests in the first world-scale oxygen production plant fit to accommodate renewable energy in the grid - Air Liquide,"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3d3dy5haXJsaXF1aWRlLmNvbS9ncm91cC9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy1uZXdzLzIwMjAtMDctMjMvYWlyLWxpcXVpZGUtaW52ZXN0cy1maXJzdC13b3JsZC1zY2FsZS1veHlnZW4tcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1wbGFudC1maXQtYWNjb21tb2RhdGUtcmVuZXdhYmxlLWVuZXJneS1ncmlk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide announces an investment of 125 million euros to build the first world-scale Air Separation Unit (ASU) for oxygen production with an energy storage system that helps facilitate more renewable energy on the electricity grid due to its grid stabilizing capability. This highly efficient plant, with circa 10% less electricity consumption, will have a production capacity of 2,200 tons of oxygen per day, and will be built in Port of Moerdijk in the Netherlands. This project illustrates Air Liquide’s strategy to grow in strategic industrial basins, and the Group’s ability to design and implement innovative solutions contributing to the energy transition, in line with its Climate Objectives.

The new ASU is designed to be built with the proprietary solution Alive™, an innovation that enables for more flexible units to combine customers’ needs and support transition to renewable energy. The system allows the storage of up to 40 MWh of energy, which corresponds to daily consumption of 4,000 households, enabling flexibility of the energy intake from the grid. While keeping a constant production for customers, it can accommodate the intermittency of renewable energy thus contributing to the growth of power coming from the wind and solar on the electricity grid. The ASU is planned to be operational in 2022.

The new Air Separation Unit will produce oxygen, nitrogen, and argon for industrial, food, and medical markets. It will be connected to Air Liquide’s extensive pipeline network, providing customers with a safe, flexible, and reliable supply to meet their growing demand. The strategic location of Moerdijk will enable to decrease bulk truck deliveries by an estimated 400,000km driven per year, contributing to a lower environmental footprint.

Sasol to sell its Secunda oxygen production site for R8.5 billion - Sunday World,"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vc3VuZGF5d29ybGQuY28uemEvYnVzaW5lc3Mvc2Fzb2wtdG8tc2VsbC1pdHMtc2VjdW5kYS1veHlnZW4tcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1zaXRlLWZvci1yOC01LWJpbGxpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Chemical giant Sasol said today, it had reached an agreement with Air Liquide to acquire the biggest oxygen production site in the world located in Secunda, Mpumalanga for R8.5 billion.

The deal marked another step in Sasol’s non-core asset disposal programme aimed reducing its multibillion rand debt pile.

Fleetwood Grobler, Sasol President and CEO, said the group has embarked on a journey to reposition Sasol of the future.

“In the short-term, a number of measures has been developed and one of these measures is the acceleration of our asset divestment programme to streamline our portfolio by focusing on core assets,” Globler said.

“While this transaction is in line with this review and has important commercial benefits there are very clear and compelling strategic objectives – one of the most significant being the pursuit of decarbonisation not only for the ASU operations but for the whole of Sasol’s Secunda Operations. This transaction is more than a business transaction,” he added.

Air Liquide is French multinational company which supplies industrial gases and services to various industries including medical, chemical and electronic manufacturers.

Benoît Potier, Chairman and CEO of Air Liquide, said the acquisition and operation of all the oxygen production units of the Sasol Secunda site represents a key step in the long term relationship the company has had with Sasol for 40 years.

“It will enable new teams to join those of the Group already present on site. In line with our strategy and our know-how, this operation illustrates our intent to act as of now in favor of the climate and local ecosystems. It will allow both Air Liquide and Sasol to focus on their core business, combining operational efficiency and reduction of CO2 emissions,” Potier said.

Taki Nkhumeleni, acting CEO of Air Liquide PTY, South Africa, said: “Air Liquide has been operating in South Africa for more than 70 years, and we are looking forward to contributing to the development of the country. This project illustrates our commitment to South Africa.”

Sasol has set a goal of reducing its debt to about $4-billion by the end of its 2021 financial year and envisages achieving the objective through a combination of asset disposals of between $2-billion and $4-billion.

The group last year fired its co-chief executives Bongani Nqwababa and Stephen Cornell. This followed a forensic investigation into the delays and cost overruns at Lake Charles Chemicals Project (LCCP), in the US, which showed that the project management team reporting to the duo, had “acted inappropriately, demonstrated incompetence and were not transparent."
