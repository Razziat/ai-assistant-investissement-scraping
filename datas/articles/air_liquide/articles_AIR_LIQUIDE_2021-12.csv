One is with the Spanish gas infrastructure company Redexis and the other with Italian commercial vehicle manufacturer Iveco and includes the introduction of heavy-duty hydrogen fuel cell trucks.

Redexis and Air Liquide have named their hydrogen refuelling infrastructure project DESIRE H2. The project is aimed at hydrogen infrastructure for heavy-duty vehicles in Spain. The two companies want to analyse the potential for setting up a network of up to 100 stations that should link Spain’s main industrial centres before 2030. Construction plans are being made for Madrid and Barcelona, as well as targeting those transport corridors that link Spain with the rest of Europe, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic.

Bénédicte Levinson, CEO of Air Liquide in Spain and Portugal, said (translated from Spanish): “As a hydrogen pioneer, Air Liquide is proud to work with Redexis to contribute to the development of an ecosystem for heavy hydrogen mobility in Spain. Hydrogen is a key element of the energy transition, especially for industrial and mobile applications.”

Desire H2 has already been registered for funding with the Spanish Ministry for Ecological Change as well as with the European Hydrogen IPCEI and the ECH2A (European Clean Hydrogen Alliance).

In the other major cooperation, Air Liquide will be cooperating with Iveco to develop a network of hydrogen refuelling stations along the main trans-European transport corridors. In conjunction with these stations, the French-Italian duo says it will also be jointly exploring the introduction of heavy-duty fuel cell trucks.

“Hydrogen can contribute significantly to reducing emissions in the transport sector, as it is particularly well suited to heavy long-haul vehicles,” said Air Liquide manager Matthieu Giard. “Air Liquide is pleased to be working with a leading company like Iveco to explore how to set this revolution in motion. In line with its sustainability objectives, Air Liquide is committed to developing hydrogen ecosystems and contributes to the emergence of a low-carbon society.”

The two companies are already collaborating on a number of different projects. In July last year, the Port of Rotterdam Authority and AirLiquide, as well as several European companies (including Iveco) joined forces to provide a hydrogen corridor for fuel cell trucks in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. The project targets 1,000 trucks by 2025. The two companies are also collaborating on a hydrogen project in southern France with the HyAMMED (Hydrogène à Aix-Marseille pour une Mobilité Écologique et Durable). This involves the development of a fleet of 44-ton fuel cell-powered trucks in conjunction with a high-pressure hydrogen refuelling station with a capacity of one ton per day. Iveco and Air Liquid cooperations in larger industry initiatives also includes the H2Haul project (Hydrogen fuel cell trucks for heavy-duty, zero-emission logistics) launched in 2019.

"Air Liquide, Laurentis join forces in helium-3 agreement - gasworld","Wed, 08 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdhc3dvcmxkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9haXItbGlxdWlkZS1sYXVyZW50aXMtam9pbi1mb3JjZXMtaW4taGVsaXVtLTMtYWdyZWVtZW50L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide, Laurentis join forces in helium-3 agreement

Industrial gas company Air Liquide has announced a partnership with clean energy expert Laurentis Energy Partners that will see the two agreeing to produce and distribute helium-3 (3He).

Utilised in industries as specialised as quantum computing, astrophysics, neutron detection and medical imaging, the rare 3He isotope will be extracted as a by-product of Darlington power generating station’s process in Canada.

What makes 3He different to the more common helium-4 is its unique properties such as a lower liquefaction temperature, allowing it so reach temperatures close to absolute zero which could see the molecule becoming an essential component in achieving fusion.

Commenting on the partnership, Emilie Mouren-Renouard, Executive Committee Member, Air Liquide, said, “This major agreement reinforces our core competencies when it comes to extreme cryogenics and deep tech, and illustrates our ambition to push back the frontiers of science.”"

This molecule is a rare isotope of helium used in quantum computing, quantum science, astrophysics, neutron detection, medical imaging and, in the future, fusion. Thanks to this new partnership, Air Liquide will be able to deliver large quantities of helium-3 to its customers around the world.

Laurentis Energy Partners will extract helium-3 as a by-product of the energy produced by the Darlington power generating station in Canada. As an expert in gas management and extreme cryogenics, Air Liquide will purify the molecule, then package and distribute it to its customers globally. The production will start by the end of this year.

Helium-3 is a very rare and stable isotope of helium. Compared to the most common isotope (helium-4), helium-3 has unique physical properties, such as a lower liquefaction temperature. Thanks to this, helium-3 has a wide range of applications, from neutron detection for security gates to deep science where helium-3 allows to reach temperatures close to absolute zero. In particular, helium-3 is necessary to produce the ultra cold required by quantum computers that harness quantum physics to process exponentially more data compared to classical computers. The promise of quantum computing is accelerated development in many fields including the search for new drugs, the discovery of new materials, and even cyber defense. As a medical isotope, He-3 can also be used to produce highly detailed Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of airways in the lung.

³He availability to increase with new supply deal - Chemical & Engineering News,"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vY2VuLmFjcy5vcmcvbWF0ZXJpYWxzLzMtYXZhaWxhYmlsaXR5LWluY3JlYXNlLW5ldy1zdXBwbHkvOTkvd2ViLzIwMjEvMTLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Credit: Air Liquide/Cryoconcept

The industrial gas giant Air Liquide has signed a long-term agreement to purchase helium-3 (3He) from a Canadian nuclear power firm. The arrangement creates the first significant private supply of the ultra-rare gas, a light isotope of helium used in deep cryogenics, nuclear science, and quantum computing.

Air Liquide will take 3He that Laurentis Energy Partners extracts from a nuclear power byproduct, further purify it, and package it for sale. Jennifer Chapin, director of projects at Laurentis, says the initial output will be between 5,000 and 10,000 L per year. “This really does present a shift in terms of market availability,” she says.

How low can you go? 3He dilution cooling can get a system close to absolute zero Room temperature: 20 °C (293.15 K) Water ice: 0 °C (273.15 K) Dry ice in an acetone bath: −78 °C (195 K) Circulating liquid nitrogen: −195.8 °C (77 K) Circulating liquid helium: −268.9 °C (2.4 K) Helium evaporation: as low as −272.15 °C (1 K) 3He dilution: as low as −273.145 °C (0.005 K)

Though the gas can be used for medical imaging and other nuclear science, Patrick Wikus, a cryogenics expert at the scientific instrument maker Bruker, expects the main application of the new supply to be in quantum computing, which requires operating temperatures near 0 K.

Conventional liquid 4He cooling gets down to 1–4 K. To go even colder, scientists mix super-cooled 3He and 4He; the entropy gain from the mixing cools the system down even further. Called 3He-4He dilution, the process can get as low as 5 mK.

Adding 3He to a typical chiller costs $30,000 to $40,000, Wikus says, at a cost today of around $1,000 per L. At that price, recycling is a must. “When I did my PhD, I had 20 L of 3He. If I had lost those, that would have been it for my thesis,” he says.

Wikus says the new supply could lower the barrier to entry for quantum computing. In September, Air Liquide made an initial investment in this area when it purchased an 80% stake in the 3He-4He dilution equipment maker CryoConcept.

The main way 3He forms on Earth is from the radioactive decay of tritium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen. 3He itself is not radioactive.

The US and Russian militaries use tritium to boost the destructive power of some nuclear weapons; the 3He available today typically comes from its removal from bombs to maintain high tritium concentrations. Most of it stays in government hands for use in neutron detectors by port inspectors looking for smuggled nuclear materials.

A type of nuclear power plant called a pressurized heavy-water reactor also produces tritium as a waste stream. In November, Laurentis started extracting 3He from the tritium stock at the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station near Toronto, which is owned and operated by Laurentis’s parent company, Ontario Power Generation."

New renewables 'mega-buyers' emerge in European heavy industry - S&P Global,"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zcGdsb2JhbC5jb20vbWFya2V0aW50ZWxsaWdlbmNlL2VuL25ld3MtaW5zaWdodHMvbGF0ZXN0LW5ld3MtaGVhZGxpbmVzL25ldy1yZW5ld2FibGVzLW1lZ2EtYnV5ZXJzLWVtZXJnZS1pbi1ldXJvcGVhbi1oZWF2eS1pbmR1c3RyeS02ODAyNjY3M9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Onshore wind turbines in Emden, Germany. Many of the country's industrials are not yet aligned with national climate ambitions.

Heavy industry is increasingly driving demand for renewable power as emissions-intensive companies respond to decarbonization pressures and the need for long-term electricity supplies.

Companies in the sector have agreed on more renewables power deals this year than in the last two years combined, according to the RE-Source Platform, a forum for corporate renewables sourcing. Heavy industry accounted for about 20% — or 1.1 GW — of this year's corporate market for renewables power purchase agreements, or PPAs, RE-Source said.

German chemicals producer BASF SE and French industrial gas giant Air Liquide SA are among those to sign long-term renewables PPAs in 2021. Other makers of traditionally pollution-heavy products — such as steel, cement and, increasingly, hydrogen — will likely follow suit due to environmental pressure from customers and investors as well as looming net-zero emissions policies.

Tech companies have historically dominated the corporate PPA market, but the growth in demand from heavy industry points to a ""new class of mega-buyers,"" said Luca Pedretti, COO and co-founder of PPA market and analytics platform Pexapark.

'Incredible demand'

BASF, the world's largest chemicals company, agreed in November to buy 186 MW of power from Ørsted A/S's Borkum Riffgrund 3 offshore wind project and closed a 25-year deal with Engie SA to take up to 20.7 TWh of electricity, initially from wind farms in Spain.

""The chemical sector has a challenging path toward decarbonization, but it will also make one of the biggest contributions,"" Ørsted CEO Mads Nipper said in a news release after the deal with BASF.

Meanwhile, Air Liquide signed a PPA with TotalEnergies SE to buy 50 GWh of renewable power per year for 15 years, and Spanish steel company Sidenor Aceros Especiales SL and German cement-maker HeidelbergCement AG have also struck PPAs this year.

Green hydrogen is a key driver of interest in renewables PPAs. Companies are planning to produce vast quantities of hydrogen to decarbonize chemical and industrial processes, for instance, which will require gigawatts of new renewables capacity.

""It's undeniable,"" said Ekow Yankah, CEO of digital investment platform RealPort. ""[Hydrogen] will create incredible demand."" That will also mean PPA deals of greater scale in the coming years, Yankah said.

'Long-term opportunities'

It is unclear whether enough renewables capacity can be built quickly enough to meet corporations' needs, especially given the amount of power required for hydrogen, Pexapark's Pedretti said.

Supply and demand could become even tighter as more companies seek green electricity. In Germany, for instance, one in three major corporations is yet to put targets in place to comply with the country's updated climate law that requires net-zero emissions by 2045, five years earlier than the previous timeline, according to S&P Global Ratings.

Of the 35 largest German companies covered by Ratings, 35% do not yet have a net-zero target in line with the new climate law, the agency said in a Nov. 29 report. Several companies are aligned to the old 2050 net-zero target, including BASF, airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG and car-maker Volkswagen AG — all among the top 10 corporate emitters in Germany — and may eventually update their goals.

""Many market participants are focusing on the cost and business implications of [Germany's] accelerated [net-zero] timeline, but we believe the way corporations manage their emission-abatement efforts could also create long-term opportunities,"" Ratings analysts said in the report.

On the back of its PPA activity, BASF announced in November the establishment of a dedicated renewables division to develop renewables projects in-house and continue its procurement of green power from third parties. To reach net-zero, the company anticipates needing three to four times as much renewable electricity as it consumes today, which stands at 9 TWh annually.

""The reliable and efficient supply to BASF with sufficient quantities of electricity from renewable sources at competitive prices is necessary for the implementation of our goals and the achievement of the targeted climate neutrality,"" Horatio Evers, managing director of BASF Renewable Energy GmbH, said in a statement at the time."

It is expected in 2027. The manufacturer has chosen the use of liquid hydrogen, whose energy density is much higher than that of hydrogen in gaseous form.

After intensive testing of the advanced prototype conducted by Mercedes-Benz Trucks since April, the first road tests should start before the end of the year. Customer trials are scheduled for 2023 and, from 2027, the first mass-produced GenH2 Trucks will be delivered to customers.

To further develop this technology, Daimler Truck AG created the “cellcentric” joint venture with the Volvo Group in March. Cellcentric’s ambition is to become one of the world’s leading manufacturers of fuel cell systems. The company therefore plans to establish one of the largest mass production operations of fuel cell systems in Europe. Thanks for staying up to date with Hydrogen Central.

Production is scheduled to start in 2025. For fuel cell trucks, a collaboration agreement was concluded by Daimler Truck AG with Shell New Energies NL B.V. (Shell) in May. The two partners plan to set up an infrastructure of hydrogen stations and launch fuel cell trucks across Europe.

Cameroon: Ministry of Energy reveals progress in the elaboration of national renewable energy master plan - Business in Cameroon,"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luY2FtZXJvb24uY29tL2VuZXJneS8xNjEyLTEyMTU4LWNhbWVyb29uLW1pbmlzdHJ5LW9mLWVuZXJneS1yZXZlYWxzLXByb2dyZXNzLWluLXRoZS1lbGFib3JhdGlvbi1vZi1uYXRpb25hbC1yZW5ld2FibGUtZW5lcmd5LW1hc3Rlci1wbGFu0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Business in Cameroon) - Cameroon has already made progress in the elaboration of its renewable energy master plan, according to the Ministry of Water and Energy. “In 2021, in collaboration with the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the Ministry of Water and Energy initiated the elaboration of its renewable energy master plan that will serve as a guide for its renewable energy creation plan and the achievement of its target to reach 25% contribution of renewable energies in the energy mix by 2035,” the Ministry informs.

It adds that currently, they have started the data collection phase, and are already offering training on the use of IRENA’s SPLAT model through the “Message”. Also, they have started inputting and updating data in the software as a prelude to the master plan. Once those phases are completed, the elaboration and validation of the said plan can start.

Presently in Cameroon, renewable energies still contribute just a minor portion of the energy mix. According to the World Bank, hydroelectricity officially contributes over 60% of that mix against barely 1% for solar, wind, and biomass, which are renewable energy sources with outstanding potentials. Meanwhile, for UNESCO, Cameroon has a significant renewable energy potential, solar and biomass notably.

According to internal sources, in November 2021, the water utility took delivery of similar construction work in Edea, the regional capital of the Littoral region.

The two projects were implemented by Spanish multinational Btd, whose regional director for Africa is since December 21, 2018, Cameroonian-born Philippe Wobiwouo. Overall, the projects in Bertoua and Edea required a XAF27.3 billion investment. They will boost drinking water production capacity by 56% in Bertaou and 88% in Edea. At the same time, storage capacities will rise by 444% and 500% respectively, according to project documents.

In the framework of the projects, 94 kilometers of hydraulic hoses were installed in Edea and 137 kilometers in Bertoua. Overall, the works will substantially improve water supply in the two cities concerned therefore facilitating access to the basic necessity for some 235,000 residents (about 110,000 in Edea and 125,000 in Bertoua).

The Bertoua and Edea projects are components of a larger project aimed at improving water supply in Yaoundé and three secondary towns (Bertoua, Edéa, and Ngaoundéré). Estimated at some XAF103 billion, it is funded by the French Development Agency and the European Investment Bank.

After delivering the Edea and Bertoua projects, Btd hopes it will land a deal for the Yaoundé component. For sources close to the case, it is in pole position in the related contract awarding process.
