Coca-Cola turns to hydrogen power for forklift fleet - Renewable Energy Magazine,"Tue, 15 Feb 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlbmV3YWJsZWVuZXJneW1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9taXNjZWxsYW5lb3VzL2NvY2Fjb2xhLXR1cm5zLXRvLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLXBvd2VyLWZvci1mb3JrbGlmdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tuesday, 15 February 2011

Air Liquide Industrial U.S. LP (Air Liquide) will supply hydrogen to power a fleet of 37 forklift vehicles at Coca-Cola’s bottling and distribution centre in San Leandro (California, US). Air Liquide will provide the liquid hydrogen, filling station and infrastructure to power the forklift fleet at Coca-Cola’s 250,000 square foot facility.

Hydrogen fuel cell powered forklift trucks represent an important segment of the hydrogen energy market Coca-Cola hopes to save 1.6 million kilowatt hours of electricity annually by removing the infrastructure associated with traditional lead-acid batteries and replacing it with hydrogen-powered machines. “Air Liquide continues to pave the way in providing innovative technology and demonstrated solutions for global challenges such as energy efficiency and environmental responsibility. The Coca-Cola installation is the latest to validate hydrogen as a practical and commercially viable fuel source and Air Liquide’s leading role in this growing global market,"" commented Michael J. Graff, President and CEO of American Air Liquide Holdings, Inc. and member of the Air Liquide’s Group Executive Committee.

The recent agreement with Coca Cola is Air Liquide’s second hydrogen fuelling installation of this type in North America that combines the hydrogen supply and refilling expertise of Air Liquide with Plug Power’s GenDrive fuel cell solution. The first such agreement was Air Liquide’s forklift installation at Walmart Canada’s sustainable distribution centre in Alberta (Canada).

In 2010, Air Liquide has provided more than 40,000 hydrogen fills worldwide. The company has a number of other filling installations in North America, including those for buses and other vehicles. Air Liquide provided hydrogen and filling infrastructure for transit buses at the 2010 Winter Olympics.

Other hydrogen partnerships are arising all over the world: Air Liquide will provide one hydrogen station in Oslo, Norway to supply five buses from a Norwegian transportation company. In Japan, two other hydrogen filling stations were recently delivered including one for the regional government of Saga to demonstrate the feasibility of a complete “green hydrogen” chain from wood chips to clean mobility.

“Sustainability is a core component of our business at Coca-Cola and we have a goal to be the beverage industry leader in energy conservation and climate protection,” said Brian P. Kelly, Product Supply Leader, Coca-Cola Refreshments. “Converting to hydrogen fuel cell powered forklifts in our San Leandro facility represents one more step towards our commitment to reduce carbon emissions by 15 percent by 2020.”

Tanker flips in Assumption - Houma Courier,"Wed, 16 Feb 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdW1hdG9kYXkuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvMjAxMS8wMi8xNi90YW5rZXItZmxpcHMtaW4tYXNzdW1wdGlvbi8yNjk2MjE2OTAwNy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tanker flips in Assumption

AMELIA — A truck driver was ticketed Tuesday after the 18-wheeler he was driving turned over in Assumption Parish, leaking an unknown amount of liquid oxygen, State Police said.

The driver, Johnny Carter, 42, of Baton Rouge, lost control in a curve while heading south on La. 662 near Tuboscope Pipeline Services, 1844 La. 662, Amelia, police said.

The truck and trailer, carrying 4,600 gallons of liquid oxygen, slipped off the right side of the road and rolled over.

The truck is owned by Air Liquide, which specializes in gas sales, said Master Trooper Bryan Zeringue.

Carter was transported to Teche Regional Medical Center in Morgan City and treated for minor injuries. He was released Tuesday evening and charged with careless operation of a hazardous material, police said.

Police closed a 1.5-mile stretch of La. 662 between La. 398 and U.S. 90 for most of Tuesday afternoon.

Vapors from liquid oxygen can seriously burn a person's skin. While not flammable, it can cause other chemicals to burn more robustly.

Barry Domangue, a State Police hazardous-materials technician, said the circumstances of Tuesday's wreck would not have caused the liquid oxygen to explode.

“It needs something else to help it ignite,” Domangue said. “It would make that flame burn hotter.”

Zeringue said nothing close to the truck would have caused ignition.

Domangue said even if the wreck had caused sparks and the truck leaked diesel, an explosion would have been unlikely. If other chemicals or materials such as gasoline had been present, an explosion could have been more likely.

Tuboscope employees were evacuated because of the leak. The amount that leaked is not known. Zeringue said officials let the liquid oxygen cool before Bayou L'ourse firefighters sprayed it with water.

The substance does not pose an environmental risk, officials said.

Seppic : Jérôme Villeneuve prend la direction du site de Castres - L'Usine Nouvelle,"Fri, 18 Feb 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzaW5lbm91dmVsbGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvc2VwcGljLWplcm9tZS12aWxsZW5ldXZlLXByZW5kLWxhLWRpcmVjdGlvbi1kdS1zaXRlLWRlLWNhc3RyZXMuTjE0NjkwNNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Nomination. Après quatre ans au poste de directeur de la Société d’exploitation de produits pour les industries chimiques (Seppic) à Castres, dans le Tarn, Loïc Doguet cède son siège à Jérôme Villeneuve. Celui-ci aura pour mission d’accompagner le développement de ce site industriel principalement dédié aux domaines de la santé et de la beauté.

A 41 ans, le nouveau directeur n’est pas novice dans le secteur de l’industrie. Il a déjà dix-sept ans d’expérience derrière lui en tant qu’ingénieur procédés, ingénieur de fabrication, directeur de site ou encore directeur industriel. Jérôme Villeneuve a aussi passé cinq ans aux Etats-Unis au sein de W.R. Grace, groupe mondial de spécialité chimique de 6 000 personnes.

La passation de pouvoir, intervenue lundi dernier, ne marque pas pour autant la fin de la collaboration entre la Seppic, filiale d’Air Liquide, et Loïc Doguet qui rejoint le siège parisien en tant que directeur des Opérations.

Installé sur huit hectares, le site Seppic de Castres comprend des laboratoires de recherche et une usine de production. Environ 300 personnes y travaillent et fabriquent 600 produits différents (excipients cosmétiques, excipients pharmaceutiques…).
