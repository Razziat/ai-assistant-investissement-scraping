Qlixbi: the human story behind - Air Liquide,"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvaW5kdXN0cnkvcWxpeGJpLWh1bWFuLXN0b3J5LWJlaGluZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide has received a prestigious Red Dot Design Award for its Qlixbi packaged gas offer. What was it about this system for supplying welders with gas cylinders that caught the jury’s attention? What is unique about this new solution? We went behind the scenes to meet the people involved in the design process from the start.

“During the trialling phase, there was this one session at a distribution center in United Kingdom,” recalls Sylvestre Coulon, “when we had the first iteration of the design that really looked like today’s Qlixbi – and one of the three test customers, quite a young chap, started to get really enthusiastic about the easy-to-read reserve indicator and the simple change connector. ‘If you just moved that part a bit down…’ he said, grabbing my arm and gesticulating. That was when I knew that we were really onto something.” Qlixbi is Air Liquide’s latest game-changing innovation in welding. Developed with welders for welders, Qlixbi is a gas cylinder package like no other combined with a suite of smart digital solutions that simplifies their day-to-day work. Making a product centered on customer usages Sylvestre Coulon, Offer Manager at Air Liquide, has been involved in Qlixbi right from the start. Due to his hands-on role in the project, he is just the right person to explain the details of the revolutionary approach the company took to designing this packaged gas offer. “With Qlixbi, we wanted to apply the same methodology as in consumer goods or software development to industrial design. The rationale was that this would help us reduce the length of development cycles and, most importantly, make a product centered on customer usages.”

That meant getting potential customers involved from the off, producing mock-ups and prototypes at short intervals for them to test, and then integrating their feedback into the next iteration.







In total, 700 welders were involved in the design phase, with 30 test cycles taking place.







“It was a completely new way of developing an industrial product, but it really paid off. Welders are not the type of people to say nice things about a design for the sake of being polite,” adds Coulon with a knowing chuckle, “so the feedback they gave was honest – and therefore valuable.”

Before they were presented with the first prototypes, some of the welders had already received visits from the multidisciplinary Qlixbi team: sociologists were sent to carry out interviews and observe them at work. All in all, the project drew on a broad range of Air Liquide expertise, from packaged gas specialists with core product knowledge through to experts in user research, user experience (UX) and the Internet of Things (IoT). In another first for the segment, a design agency was commissioned at an early stage to bring in approaches from other industries and product categories. It was key for Air Liquide to be able to offer a simple, aesthetic, and efficient product to its existing clients in traditional industries. Meeting both technical and emotional expectations ""From a design perspective, there are three key areas,"" explains Matthieu Delapalme, Director of Pulp Design, the agency that helped Air Liquide in the process: “technical performance, ergonomic requirements, and aesthetic considerations. Air Liquide’s technical competence is unparalleled, of course,” says Delapalme, “so our role was to help improve the ergonomics – lightweight construction, easy handling, and functionality – and to rethink the aesthetics by creating a clear visual language for Qlixbi."" ""Two things we identified during our preparatory work was welders’ deep pride in the ability to do a job well and a strong connection with objects and materials,” recounts Coulon. “Just because they work in industrial environments with all the dust, oil, and noise that entails, that doesn’t mean they don’t value aesthetics,” he adds. As such, the Qlixbi team worked on the hypothesis that, while a pleasing appearance would not be the key selling point for Qlixbi, it would strengthen customer loyalty in the long run. ""What is more,"" says Coulon, ""one way companies can attract and retain increasingly rare young welders is by providing working environments and products which respond to their expectations"". Creating a modern design is an expression of Air Liquide's commitment to welders These expectations are increasingly shaped by companies with a strong design culture who have, in recent decades, transformed more or less utilitarian products into smooth, desirable, even beautiful objects. Beauty, though, is in the eye of the beholder and dependent on context, so the challenge for the Qlixbi team was to introduce design elements into the product which gave it a distinctive appearance and emotional content, yet did not belie its industrial purpose. One element in play here was packaging. In classic industrial design, the wrapping materials in which products are shipped is rarely given much consideration. Qlixbi connectors, however, come in an attractive box containing simply illustrated instructions and information on how to access the full manual online. “This ‘welcome kit’, as we call it, both improves usability and helps reinforce the overall ‘wow factor’ – the feeling that this really is a product that was designed for them before being a technical tool.” Qlixbi connectors come in an attractive box containing simply illustrated instructions and information on how to access the full manual online.

""With Qlixbi, we had the opportunity to try out new looks, symbolic and emotional content, and ergonomic concepts""

Three questions for Antoine Frenal, Design Office Manager :

What was your role in the Qlixbi project – and what was your experience of it? What was your role in the Qlixbi project – and what was your experience of it? : open accordion I was involved at various stages of the project in different roles. At first, I helped design the technical basis of the product. Then when we got to the development and industrial stage, I managed materials and mechanical design team, and also liaised with the various suppliers and sub-contractors involved. My experience of Qlixbi was that it was a very different kind of project: we placed the user firmly at its centre, talked to potential customers about what a truly contemporary welding gas supply system would look like, and were able to repeatedly test various concepts for improved usability and aesthetics. I would also like to underline that all teams involved in this project have worked like one. This was a defining element of success. How was this different to Air Liquide’s approach to design thus far? And what were the constants? How was this different to Air Liquide’s approach to design thus far? And what were the constants? : open accordion With Qlixbi, the technical basics remained unchanged, but due to the agile, iterative way of working, we had the opportunity to try out new looks, symbolic and emotional content, and ergonomic concepts on this technical framework. So rather than making one decision about how the product should look or feel and then sticking with it, we were able to test various options and see what was or wasn’t working. Essentially, we fused safe, secure, stable modules with new design elements. Stage by stage, what does the Air Liquide design process look like for Qlixbi? Stage by stage, what does the Air Liquide design process look like for Qlixbi? : open accordion Like all designers, we always start with sketches – really quite rough early on. Once we have something we think will work, it goes into modeling: the first models are not particularly detailed, but are more about getting a feel for size, weight, and handling. We slowly work our way towards prototypes, testing functional elements and improving them. With connectors, for instance, that means making levers easier to feel and manipulate through the thick, heat-resistant gloves that welders wear. For Qlixbi, we took these prototyping and modelling methods and sped up the cycles, making them more flexible so that we could integrate feedback from beta tests into the next iteration. The project also brought us a new technical challenge: integrating electronic components into the product in order to support its digital service component. One challenge was making sure that our product was heat-resistant and that electronic sensors and communications technology would be robust enough in view of the fact that their life-spans and maintenance cycles differ from those of metal cylinders and connectors. This added an electronic dimension to our mechanical design work – which, thanks to the broad range of expertise in the project, we mastered.

Qlixbi, not just a physical product Another unique aspect of Qlixbi is that it is not just a physical product, but a system which unites a product and services. There is a Qlixbi app to help companies monitor their gas reserves, for instance; managers receive alerts when they need to reorder and can even use an auto restock function for complete peace of mind. “We worked closely with UX designers to make sure that the software interface is as intuitive and accessible as the cylinders and connectors,” says Coulon: “It’s easy to design something complicated, but far more difficult to make it simple.” A wide range of people and expertise behind a success ""Since the beginning of the project, we’ve worked with a really wide range of professions and people. It’s been very enriching – and because there are always improvements which can be made, we’re not finished yet.” Isn’t he proud that the success of the project to date has been recognized with an award, though? “Sure, but winning a prize is one thing – watching the product enthuse the people who use it is the real reward.” Viewing this video may result in cookies being placed by the vendor of the video platform to which you will be directed.

Mobilized during the health crisis - Air Liquide,"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvaGVhbHRoY2FyZS9tb2JpbGl6ZWQtZHVyaW5nLWhlYWx0aC1jcmlzaXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Protecting the health of employees, customers, patients and partners; ensuring continuity of service in essential sectors such as healthcare, energy and the food industry; responding to the health emergency by supporting unprecedented measures throughout the world to fight the COVID-19 pandemic… Spotlight on an exceptional mobilization.

From the very beginning of what has become a global health crisis, the Group has prepared and mobilized itself across the globe, putting its continuity plans into action and implementing remote working for its teams.

Healthcare teams on the front line The Healthcare teams quickly organized themselves in order to meet the increased demand for medical oxygen, to guarantee the supply of equipment such as respirators for hospitals and to secure the return of stabilized patients to their homes. Within a few weeks, this mobilization became essential to helping healthcare workers save lives.



Medical oxygen demand increased fivefold, sometimes even six-fold, in the most affected areas. In China, the Huaerwen site teams tripled their cylinder-filling capacity in order to secure supplies to 450 hospitals in the east of the country. All over the world, our teams have had to implement or adapt installations in record time—such as the San Maurizio de Bolzano hospital in Italy, where an oxygen tank was installed in a few days.



To meet the increased needs of hospitals in France and in response to the Government’s request, Air Liquide has partnered with Groupe PSA, Schneider Electric and Valeo to produce 10,000 respirators over 50 days, the equivalent of its usual production over three years.“We faced a truly industrial, but also human challenge”, explains Benoît Potier, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Group.

Supporting hospitals also means relieving them. Working alongside medical teams, Home Healthcare entities in Europe have supported the return home of COVID-19 patients requiring oxygen therapy treatment after leaving the hospital.They have also continued to support patients suffering from chronic diseases through the use of special measures: remote video follow-ups and home visits for the most critical patients, in accordance with specific safety protocols.

The significant mobilization efforts of our employees have been recognized many times by healthcare professionals and patients alike. Voir les diapositives précédentes Voir les diapositives précédentes

""In the early days of the crisis, patients were worried when we came to their homes but they were reassured by our protective equipment and our advice. It was our role to explain, with patience and education, hygiene rules that protect them.""







Jessica



Home Healthcare nurse in Italy Exceptional measures in an unprecedented situation Air Liquide teams have been involved in initiatives that have emerged in China, Europe, the United States, Brazil, etc. For example, they have been working to convert certain locations (parking lots, stadiums, etc.) into field hospitals. Over four days, the Palacio Municipal convention center in Madrid (IFEMA) was turned into Spain’s largest hospital, with 5,500 beds, over a third supplied with medical gases. In France, Air Liquide was involved in the implementation of medicalized highspeed trains in order to relieve overcrowded hospitals in the East region. The Group also contributed to the early opening of a new intensive care unit at the Henri-Mondor AP-HP hospital (Assistance publique-Hôpitaux de Paris), located in the Paris area. ""I want to thank Air Liquide for all the efforts made to continue taking care of patients, despite the risks involved.""

Unfailing solidarity





Spontaneous acts of solidarity have increased. Across the world, employees of different Group entities have come forward to help their Healthcare colleagues. Home Healthcare entities, for their part, have provided hospitals with concentrators, respirators and hospital beds—all precious resources during this time of crisis.







The Air Liquide Foundation has proactively contributed to this dynamic by supporting scientific research projects connected with the pandemic. Out in the field, it has also increased aid for local associations that are operating among the most vulnerable communities.

Ensuring the continuity of essential activities A further challenge has been maintaining and adapting the gas supply in order to guarantee the supply chain for essential sectors such as the food industry, energy or healthcare. At its sites, Air Liquide has refocused its operations on the production of molecules that are essential to health, nutrition and mobility. This continuity of service has been recognized by many of our customers. Teams have also been mobilized in Electronics in order to ensure the supply of advanced materials required for the manufacture of semiconductors, essential for the digital infrastructures that were particularly in demand during the crisis. In tackling these industrial and human challenges, Air Liquide is more than ever in line with its ambition to contribute to a sustainable society, with all its stakeholders. Healthcare, a long-standing commitment



For many years, Air Liquide has been a major player in home healthcare throughout the world, an expert in homecare for chronic diseases and a supplier of medical gases for hospitals. Today, the Group helps 1.7 million patients at home and 15,000 hospitals and clinics in over 35 countries."
Climate emergency... no time to lose! - ALTEN Group - Alten,"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsdGVuLmNvbS9jbGltYXRlLWVtZXJnZW5jeS1uby10aW1lLXRvLWxvc2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The times in which we live make us aware that it is mainly our methods of production, consumption and activities that contribute to global warming, and thus in some way to the deterioration of our own health. As a reminder, the 2018 IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report which argues in favour of limiting global warming to 1.5°C is unequivocal: each half-degree matters and we must take immediate action, all together!

12 DECEMBER 2015: 195 countries attended the COP 21 in Paris and signed an international agreement to keep global warming below 2°C and reduce greenhouse gases.

3 NOVEMBER 2019: 20 million people in New Delhi were blanketed by a choking smog so thick that planes were diverted to neighbouring airports. That day, in the Indian capital, the concentration of PM 2.5 fine particles in the atmosphere hit 810 micrograms per cubic metre of air, a rate more than thirty-two times higher than the WHO (World Health Organization) recommendations!

A question of life or death

Is India an example of what we can expect for the planet’s future? How can we change the destiny of mankind? What are our levers for action?

So many questions which become more pressing with each passing day, while the evidence piles up: a recent study published by the European Society of Cardiology (1) for 2015 revealed that in Europe, fine particles and ozone would claim many more victims than previously estimated: almost 800,000 people a year. Globally, there would be 8.8 million additional deaths.

“That means that air pollution causes more deaths per year than smoking tobacco,” says Professor Thomas Münzel , co-author of the study. “As most fine particles and other air pollutants in Europe come from burning fossil fuels, we must urgently switch to other energy sources,” his colleague, Pr. Lelieveld , argues.

Towards a new industrial revolution

Yet oil, which since the 1950s has become the world’s most important source of energy, still meets over 30% of energy requirements. It remains by far and away the main raw material used to make transportation fuel and is omnipresent in the petrochemical industry, even though its decline is inevitable due to the depletion of deposits.

According to the American essayist and economist Jeremy Rifkin (2): “The civilization of fossil fuels, which is at the base of the first two industrial revolutions, is collapsing in real time and it is the governments that must create the infrastructure for the industrial revolution of the twenty-first century.”

He calls for nations to create environmentally friendly banks and regions to set up their own banks for issuing green bonds “that will attract investment funds looking for stable longterm returns”. For decarbonisation is an absolute must if we want our planet, and mankind, to have a future.

Greater global awareness…

Times certainly have changed since 1979 when volcanologist Haroun Tazieff was simply met with disdain and amusement when he predicted the forthcoming greenhouse effect.

Since the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, nearly every country on the planet has made a commitment to take action and limit global warming. “Every one of us is certain that it is our activities (fossil fuels, deforestation, agriculture, industry and cement manufacturing) that are contributing to the increase in carbon dioxide and methane (two main greenhouse gases) and therefore to global warming,” explained Jean Jouzel, a prominent French climatologist and glaciologist and former vice-chair of the IPCC Scientific Council when he spoke on France Culture last October.

… But results are lagging behind

However, the Paris Agreement is proving difficult to implement. The nations made a commitment to immediately plan the reduction of their CO2 emissions (with China obtaining a deferral for after 2025), but today we see that many of them are lagging behind on the path to energy transition which entails an exit from carbon-based fossil fuels, coal in particular.

So as Jean Jouzel warns, “if we want to limit global warming to around 2°C, we must take urgent action in a very pro-active way and use all the tools at our disposal”.

In spite of the indisputable findings, many questions remain over the solutions to be implemented, experts have differing opinions, a large number of political leaders are still dragging their feet and citizens are often ill-informed. A BVA survey in June 2019 revealed that 69% of French people think that nuclear energy contributes to greenhouse gas production. And yet, as Yves Bréchet , the High Commissioner for Atomic Energy from 2012 to 2018, recalled in Le Point (3), “nuclear energy produces 200 times less carbon dioxide than coal, 100 times less than gas and the same amount as wind power. Even the IPCC pointed out in its 2018 report that we will not do without nuclear energy”. Halting net CO2 emissions in less than 40 years is a major global challenge , but a number of experts agree that it is technically achieveable and at an acceptable cost. Provided, as pointed out by Pierre Papon , ex-Director General of the CNRS (the French National Centre for Scientific Research) in his blog (4), it is understood that “energy transition has 3 dimensions – scientific, industrial and socio-economic. These must be simultaneously and consistently taken into account”.

“2015 was a turning point when suddenly everyone realised that we had to act fast. The actions taken by Greta Thunberg and some of the world’s youth are having a snowball effect. Suddenly, everyone, or almost everyone, feels involved. And that’s a good thing.” Dominique LECOCQ – VP Ecosystems & Communications at Air Liquide Hydrogen Energy World Business Line

Incheon Airport green lights US$40m incentive scheme for airlines - TTG Asia,"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR0Z2FzaWEuY29tLzIwMjAvMDYvMTcvaW5jaGVvbi1haXJwb3J0LWdyZWVuLWxpZ2h0cy11czQwbS1pbmNlbnRpdmUtc2NoZW1lLWZvci1haXJsaW5lcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Incheon International Airport is set to implement a new incentive system worth US$40 million to support the aviation industry, which is facing an unprecedented crisis due to Covid-19.

For the passenger sector, Incheon Airport has agreed to support landing fees for new airlines and routes for up to two years. It will also exempt landing fees for all flights arriving and departing late at night to activate late-night flights.

About US$33 million of the total budget is slated to be used in the passenger sector to subsidise roughly US$8 per boarding passenger, while the remaining US$7 million will be used to prop up the freight sector, including reducing landing fees for cargo aircrafts.

The move comes after South Korea’s airline industry recorded its worst first-quarter earnings. For one, Korean Air had a first-quarter operating loss of about US$47 million, a major dip from the operating profit of US$198 million seen in the same time last year.

Asiana Airlines also posted operating losses of US$172 million, while low-cost carriers such as Jeju Air, Jin Air and T’way Airlines all suffered losses of US$54.5 million, US$26 million and US$18.5 million, respectively.

Incheon Airport president Koo Bon-hwan said: “We will do our best to recover air demand and support the airline industry, while preventing the spread of the virus at the forefront of the nation’s defence line.”

However, the outlook for airlines in the second quarter seems even dimmer. Passengers are still reluctant to fly, with aviation information portal system Air Portal reporting that the total number of air passengers in April stood at about 1.3 million, down 86.7 per cent compared to last year.

Kim Yoo-hyuk, a researcher at Hanwha Investment & Securities, said: “As countries still continue to impose entry restrictions, demand (from) international passengers will not grow substantially… Larger airlines are planning to resume operations on certain routes from June, but we need more time to fully recover.”"
Carlton Power and Highview to build 250MWh liquid air energy storage plant | theenergyst.com - The Energyst,"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlZW5lcmd5c3QuY29tL2Nhcmx0b24tcG93ZXItYW5kLWhpZ2h2aWV3LXRvLWJ1aWxkLTI1MG13aC1saXF1aWQtYWlyLWVuZXJneS1zdG9yYWdlLXBsYW50L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Carlton Power and Highview Power are partnering to build a massive cryogenic liquid-air energy (LAES) plant in Manchester.

Carlton has been trying to build a combined cycle gas turbine power station at Trafford for years. It now hopes to finally build that CCGT alongside the 250MWh LAES storage plant, creating a new kind of hybrid.

The two firms have formed a joint venture and intend to build four ‘CryoBatteries’ totalling 1GWh.

The Trafford plant, which has £10m grant funding from Beis, is expected to be delivering power within two years.

Cool running

Highview commissioned its first large scale plant last year, a 5MW/15MWh plant in Bury, greater Manchester.

Then CEO, Gareth Brett, told The Energyst that it intended to build a 50MW plant and bid it into the Capacity Market – and that building large plants was actually much easier than the 5MW Bury development because parts are easier to come by.

“At 50MW scale, the refrigeration plant and turbo expander are at a size that suits all of the big machinery manufacturers,” said Brett.

He added that LAES technology, while not as quick as lithium-ion batteries, “can do anything pumped storage can do.”

Strong and stable

The plants will provide capacity and stabilisation services for both national and regional grids, as well as make money from arbitraging power prices.

Carlton Power CEO Keith Clarke said the firm had reviewed numerous long-duration, utility-scale storage technologies, but selected Highviews LAES system “because it is scalable, clean, can deliver the grid services we need, and can be deployed now”.

He added: “We were also keen to work with Highview Power to explore the opportunity to deploy the CryoBattery in tandem with a gas-fired power plant that we have permitted to be built on the Trafford Energy Park. This type of hybrid CCGT would be an important tool to enable the UK to reach Net Zero.”

Highview CEO and president, Javier Cavada, said Carlton’s commitment to multiple LAES projects, “speaks volumes about their confidence in our technology. We are on a fast-track to develop our cryogenic energy storage systems around the globe and this partnership will help accelerate momentum in the European markets”."

This means that Waitrose lorries will run on biomethane made from food waste and food processing waste materials

In March 2019, the employee-owned business pledged to be net-zero carbon across its entire operations by 2050 at the latest and its 600 heavy goods vehicles to be switched to low-carbon biomethane by 2028. Since last year, the Partnership has reduced its total operational carbon emissions by 6.6%2 and emissions from transport have fallen by 6.9%.

The new biomethane gas filling station will be built in conjunction with Air Liquide and will open at the Partnership’s head office in Bracknell in December 2020, making it the business’s first on-site gas filling station. It will facilitate the conversion of the Bracknell Waitrose fleet to biomethane and complement gas filling stations already in use near to John Lewis and Waitrose regional distribution centres in Leyland, Lancashire, and in Northampton.

Serving approximately 120 Waitrose heavy goods trucks, the vehicles will run on biomethane made from food waste and food processing waste materials rather than diesel. This will reduce CO2 emissions by 80%, with each truck saving over 100 tonnes of CO2 every year. These gas trucks are also quieter, decreasing noise pollution, which is especially important for urban deliveries. Over the next seven years, the Bracknell site alone will save over 70,000 tonnes of CO2, equivalent to the carbon footprint produced by over 13,000 UK households3.

Since 2015, 85 of the Partnership’s heavy diesel vehicles have already been replaced with biomethane trucks, and a further 143 will be purchased and in operation by the end of 2020, making this the largest order of biomethane trucks in the UK.

To reduce carbon emissions across its transport network further, the Partnership’s ambition is to eliminate fossil fuels from its commercial vehicle and car fleet by 2030. This radical initiative could see 1,750 electric vans and light trucks introduced and approximately 750 refrigerated trailers converted from diesel to electric drive. In addition, the Partnership’s 1,300 strong car fleet would become 100% electric and any remaining vehicles that could not be converted to biomethane or electric will use hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) biodiesel."

The parent company of Waitrose and John Lewis also said it was building a dedicated biomethane gas filling station to enable its largest heavy goods vehicles to use a low-carbon alternative to diesel.

Eighty-five of the partnership’s heavy diesel vehicles have been replaced with biomethane trucks since 2015, and a further 143 will be purchased and in operation by the end of this year.

Koutéré single checkpoint project: plans in motion for the resumption of construction works - Business in Cameroon,"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luY2FtZXJvb24uY29tL2NvbnN0cnVjdGlvbi8zMDA2LTEwNDc5LWtvdXRlcmUtc2luZ2xlLWNoZWNrcG9pbnQtcHJvamVjdC1wbGFucy1pbi1tb3Rpb24tZm9yLXRoZS1yZXN1bXB0aW9uLW9mLWNvbnN0cnVjdGlvbi13b3Jrc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Business in Cameroon) - The Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) closed, on June 29, the call for expressions of international interest aimed at selecting a bidder that will carry out studies for the completion of the Koutéré single checkpoint, a border village between Cameroon and Chad.

The Commission explains that the final bidder will build an infrastructure that will improve transit and border crossing conditions. This infrastructure is expected to reduce transport time, transport cost, customs clearance time, and physical and non-physical barriers along the Douala-Ndjamena corridor.

The construction of the single post at Koutéré was launched in 2009. The works were halted in 2011 at about 20% physical progress following the foreclosure of the European Development Fund’s financing. To finalize the construction, the CEMAC Commission then conducted two studies of the remaining works. The most recent was in May 2015.

The last study, which was set at about CFAF 1.6 billion, was carried out at the request of the African Development Bank (AfDB) which proposed to allocate the funds previously earmarked for the construction of a checkpoint at the Cameroon-Chad border in Kousseri. This last attempt was not much more successful than the previous one following the closure at the end of 2016 of the African Development Fund (ADF) grant dedicated to the programme.

For the resumption of the works, the CEMAC Commission is now proposing, to update, with funding from the French Global Budget Support, the study on the construction of the said checkpoint which should reduce the numerous rackets and other harassments users and economic operators complain about on the Douala-Ndjamena corridor.

This is one of the findings published by the National Institute for Statistics (INS) in the framework of phase I of its evaluation of the socio-economic impact of the coronavirus in the country.

According to the institute, this staff reduction affected 59% of SMEs in the modern sector. It is “more pronounced in the education (92%), accommodation (hotels) and catering (71%), mining (76%) and forestry (73%)"" sectors, the Institute says.

It adds that this situation arises because the vast majority of companies have had to resort to working hour reduction (62%), borrowing (61%), postponement of planned investments (57%), cancellation of orders with suppliers (50%), employee lay-off (44%) and salary reduction (44%).

The report shows that 53% of company leaders prefer the lifting of restrictions imposed on economic activities. Informal production units (59%) and SMEs (44%) would like to see the restrictions on bars, restaurants, and transport lifted. Large enterprises (33%) would like the restriction on border closures lifted.

Let’s note that in June when the INS was publishing this assessment, some of the restrictions were being lifted already. The restrictions concerned are notably those regarding bars and the transport sector.
