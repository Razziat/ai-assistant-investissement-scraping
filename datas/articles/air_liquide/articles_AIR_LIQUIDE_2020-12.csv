Facilitating professional trade development for young people - Air Liquide,"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvaW5kdXN0cnkvZmFjaWxpdGF0aW5nLXByb2Zlc3Npb25hbC10cmFkZS1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC15b3VuZy1wZW9wbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As several regions of the world, including the United States, are facing a shortage of welders, Air Liquide’s U.S. subsidiary Airgas has expanded its training program. The goal? To help high school technology teachers and students learn new and advanced welding skills. One of the 29 initiatives supported nationwide by Airgas has reached 70 teachers in 12 high schools in Kansas. They have benefited from the expertise of Airgas specialists and equipment donations in this initiative that builds bridges between education and industry.

Brian Blackwood, Area Vice President, Airgas Mid-South

What does the Airgas training program in your area involve? The goal is to give Kansas teachers basic welding and cutting skills, so in turn they can encourage students to consider a career in welding, a job with excellent prospects. The program connects teachers and students in technical schools with industry partners to the benefit of both sides. What is its objective? There is an ongoing shortage of welders in the U.S. To date, our Kansas program has allowed 70 teachers to introduce the welding profession to a total of 330 students. If each of the 70 teachers we’ve trained results in just one of these students enrolling in technical college, we’ll have supported 70 trainee welders in their career choice. What is your motivation? To provide a level of training to teachers that they would not otherwise receive, and to give a hand up to students by offering them a lifetime skill that they can use anywhere. It's very satisfying for all of us Airgas volunteers to feel like we’re making a difference.

Elizabeth Meyer, Agricultural Education Instructor, Sublette High School, Kansas

Why did you choose to participate in this welding training program? It came highly recommended by colleagues who had attended last summer. I wanted to further develop my skills in this area, as well as gain from the expertise of industry specialists. How has it helped you in your professional career? The one-on-one interactions, classroom instruction and hands-on lab work made me more equipped to demonstrate welding practices to my students and help them produce quality welds and products. The experience also gave me insight into the industry. What is the impact of the program? Aside from the time they invested in us, the Airgas instructors offered a variety of resources for continued support, including putting us in contact with the nearest branches so we can remain connected throughout the year. But most importantly, they provided us with the most relevant information to support and prepare our students seeking employment in the industry. Gases, essential molecules for welding and cutting activities







Welding joins workpieces, usually metals. Cutting is used to separate pieces of metal sheets, structures and pipes. These processes require specific gases which have been at the heart of Air Liquide’s offers for over 100 years. In addition to welding and cutting gases, Air Liquide also offers a wide range of handling and welding equipment.







Airgas offer







In the United States, the Group can rely on its Airgas subsidiary, acquired in 2016, to support its welding customers on the other side of the Atlantic. Airgas experts evaluate the processes used by customers to guide them to the right products and equipment, always with a view to improving their performance. Airgas also offers complete supply chain management for gases as well as safety and welding equipment."

Air Liquide Americas CEO maps build-out of US hydrogen economy infrastructure - S&P Global,"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zcGdsb2JhbC5jb20vbWFya2V0aW50ZWxsaWdlbmNlL2VuL25ld3MtaW5zaWdodHMvbGF0ZXN0LW5ld3MtaGVhZGxpbmVzL2Fpci1saXF1aWRlLWFtZXJpY2FzLWNlby1tYXBzLWJ1aWxkLW91dC1vZi11cy1oeWRyb2dlbi1lY29ub215LWluZnJhc3RydWN0dXJlLTYxNjk0MzQy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"➤ A hybrid of local and long-haul hydrogen infrastructure could emerge

➤ Liquid hydrogen deliveries by truck will be an important transportation mode as the industry scales up

➤ Building the necessary hydrogen infrastructure requires ongoing research and development, public-private partnerships, regulation and legislation

American Air Liquide Holdings Inc. Chairman and CEO Michael Graff sees his company focusing on production, transportation and storage of hydrogen.

Source: L'Air Liquide SA

Industrial gas giant L'Air Liquide SA is one of the leading proponents of the hydrogen economy, a model that envisions zero-carbon hydrogen displacing fossil fuels for transportation, heating, industrial processes and power generation. Achieving that vision will require companies like Air Liquide to scale up production of green hydrogen — produced using renewable power — and blue hydrogen, which relies on carbon capture and storage.

It will also require roughly $80 billion of infrastructure investments through 2030, according to the Hydrogen Council, an industry group that counts Air Liquide among its founding members. Air Liquide has experience in hydrogen production and transportation and has supported the development of end-use markets like fuel cell electric vehicles.

S&P Global Market Intelligence interviewed American Air Liquide Holdings Inc. Chairman and CEO Michael Graff to discuss the challenges and opportunities in building out U.S. hydrogen infrastructure. This is an edited transcript of that conversation.

S&P Global Market Intelligence: Do you envision long-haul transmission pipelines playing a role in the hydrogen economy, or do you see a world where hydrogen is produced and consumed regionally?

Michael Graff : I would say that it's a bit multifaceted in our approach today. You've got basic infrastructure in certain parts of the country ... where you do have pipeline systems. We actually have very large storage systems, caverns, to store hydrogen, and that easily could create a backbone of an ecosystem to readily move hydrogen around in a given geographic area.

Now, once you utilize that infrastructure — which today is obviously fully utilized for industrial needs, primarily for refining or chemicals — you begin to look at the distributed nature of what you can produce, and how do you serve all of the local markets? So there is no doubt that a more local production and transportation, along with this broader infrastructure, is likely going to coexist as we see how these models evolve.

For us right now, when we think about that more localized or distributed nature of how you move a lot of hydrogen, especially if you begin to think about transporting it by truck or locally ... liquid hydrogen is probably the optimal way to do that, and we're actually investing in those capabilities today.

So liquid hydrogen delivery by truck might be an ideal way to transport supply locally, particularly for fuel cell electric vehicle refilling stations, similar to how gasoline is moved around today?

That's exactly right. It somehow mimics that to an extent. It makes it much easier to get to every location without having to build pipelines. You could repurpose some pipelines in certain areas. That's always a possibility. But I think that this creates a logistical system that can build off pipelines, can build off different centers of production.

The majority of the refining infrastructure today is on the Gulf Coast or on the other two coasts, and I think that that evolves maybe in a different way in the future.

What will be the chief challenges to building a larger-scale U.S. hydrogen transmission system?

Whether you're building out capabilities locally, or you're building pipeline infrastructure to make this work, you need to make sure that you have the abilities to go ahead and make that happen fairly rapidly.

It's a matter of cost. It's a matter of regulatory approvals in certain areas. It's a matter of permitting. It's a matter of right-of-ways. And I think that as with all of this, depending on what you're trying to get to, how you think about leveraging a particular type of technology to produce the hydrogen will help enable what you need to do from the infrastructure standpoint to deliver that hydrogen.

You can't do these things overnight. You're dealing with an existing infrastructure, and now you're thinking about a new infrastructure to enable these new capabilities. And I think in order to make all that happen, to make all those things evolve, obviously R&D and a lot of the things that we look to continue to work through — public-private partnerships or working joint with others — continue to evolve and will be very important.

So then in the end, you're going to need regulations and legislation to advance that smart climate solution mindset as we think about what's going to happen. So I think all those things have to come into play to make this work.

What role does Air Liquide see itself playing in building out the infrastructure to enable the hydrogen economy?

We see Air Liquide's focus as starting with technology and all the various technologies necessary to produce and manage and utilize hydrogen. We see ourselves in the production capabilities, in the development of those state-of-the-art capabilities.

We see ourselves very directly involved in the transport of that hydrogen. We know how to do that very well, and continue to develop new technologies, whether it's pipelines … whether it's by truck — whether that's gaseous or it's liquid, which we think is the way long-term for many of these markets — and also for the storage of that hydrogen.

We don't see ourselves as the retailers of hydrogen. We've helped enable that. We've built out [fuel cell electric vehicle filling] stations. We actually own some retail stations out in the state of California to enable that and demonstrate it. We've taken an active interest in a retailer on the West Coast, as well, to help enable that. But long term, we see ourselves focused on those areas from technology to delivery of hydrogen.

Air Liquide is building the world's largest proton exchange membrane, or PEM, electrolyzer in Becancour, Quebec, to produce green hydrogen. Who will be the end-users and what infrastructure will be necessary to reach them?

At that particular site, we produce some quantities of liquid hydrogen today, and we are expanding those capabilities with our additional investments. So we will be in a place where we will be able to transport that liquid hydrogen, as we will liquefy it after it's produced.

We're building out the infrastructure for 12 hydrogen refueling stations in the northeast. We are doing that, joint with Toyota, as you begin to think about the introduction of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in the northeast. We also will have that available for industrial customers, both in Canada and in the northeast part of the U.S. as well.

It'll be similar to how we will move our hydrogen from Nevada to the state of California. So you think about liquid hydrogen moving by truck, which is done today, day in and day out for a lot of industrial needs from many facilities across the country. And we see that infrastructure growing and evolving over time."
How can Europe help build China’s Hydrogen economy? - Energy Post,"Tue, 08 Dec 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZW5lcmd5cG9zdC5ldS9ob3ctY2FuLWV1cm9wZS1oZWxwLWJ1aWxkLWNoaW5hcy1oeWRyb2dlbi1lY29ub215L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On 18th November Energy Post, in partnership with the EU-China Energy Cooperation Platform, hosted a series of online workshops under the theme “China: Carbon Neutral by 2060”. The purpose was to understand the Chinese landscape and uncover opportunities for Europe. Here, the moderator for our “Hydrogen” panel, Gökçe Mete, summarises the workshop which included an expert panel discussion and questions from the audience. Taking part were Tudor Constantinescu (Principle Advisor to the Director General, DG ENER), Joachim von Scheele (Global Director Commercialisation, Linde PLC) and Mickael Naouri (Corporate Affairs Director, Air Liquide). The workshop covered blue and green hydrogen, ambitious production targets, investment, innovation, hard-to-abate sectors, heavy transport, hydrogen fuel cells, regulations, fair competition and more. The challenges of giving birth to the hydrogen economy are tremendous, but that has not stopped it entering the decarbonisation plans of both the EU and China.

The hydrogen economy is gaining a lot of attention. It has been cited as a holy grail for 100% renewables, for the power sector and the hard-to-abate sectors. At the China: Carbon Neutral by 2060 workshop, hydrogen was also cited as part of the solution to address both the Covid19 and the climate crisis.

The Covid19 pandemic impacted global energy investments, with a 17% decline reported by the IEA in Europe in electricity grids investments (with wind and efficiency holding up better than distributed solar PV and oil and gas) and a sharp reduction in private sector investment in 2020-2021.

As a result of the pandemic Green House Gas (GHG) emissions are expected to decline by 8% in 2020 globally compared to 2019, almost to the levels of ten years ago. However, if appropriate actions are not taken to maintain these levels, emissions may rebound to exceed previous levels.

The pandemic offers a once in a generation opportunity to build back better and avoid lock in effects while doing so.

Avoiding carbon lock-in

The “carbon lock-in” problem occurs when investments and policies made in the past or present to build out high-carbon energy systems inhibits the growth of the new green economy.

The European Green Deal announced by EU president Ursula von der Leyen called for the EU to utilise its collective ability, and to transform its economy and society to put it on a more sustainable path. This ambitious and forward looking agenda aims to accelerate massive public investment and increased efforts to direct private capital towards climate and environmental action, while avoiding lock-in into unsustainable practices in the next decade.

The energy sector accounts for 75% of the GHG emissions in the EU. The EU strategies for energy system integration and hydrogen therefore aim to link various parts of the energy system to pave the way towards a more efficient and interconnected energy sector.

Hydrogen

Here, hydrogen is envisaged to play a considerable role, in particular in decarbonisation of the natural gas system and of hard to abate sectors. Fossil free hydrogen, however, requires considerable amount of renewable energy and a ramp up of electrolysers.

Also, hydrogen, produced with renewable energy will compete with direct electrification, which should provide almost 50% of the EU’s energy system by 2050, compared to 23% today. Currently, there is not enough renewable energy infrastructure, because they are not being built due to curtailing. Curtailed electricity is inefficient.

Expansion of renewables

While IEA estimates for the expansion of renewables is encouraging for 2021, due to the commissioning of delayed projects and continued growth in markets where the pre-pandemic programmes were robust enough, in certain countries the expiration of certain incentives and support schemes may see a small decline in 2021. In China, for example, certain schemes for onshore wind and solar PV subsidies expire at the end of 2021. The evolution of China’s next policy framework for the period 2021-25 therefore is extremely important.

Globally, the post-pandemic green recovery outlook is in danger of being unsatisfactory. Energy Policy Tracker, which tracks public money committed to energy in recovery packages, reports that 29 major economies pledged $251 billion to fossil fuels, 53% of all public money committed to energy-intensive sectors, compared with 35% committed to clean energy.

The EU Recovery Plan underlines the urgency to take robust action with the new announced targets at the European level of a 55% reduction of GHG by 2030, and with an ongoing pipeline of legislative revisions concerning the energy and related sectors, such as transport, buildings and industry. The EU long-term budget and recovery fund earmarked 30% for climate related expenditures (although the agreement also resulted in spending cuts to key climate and environment programs).

Hydrogen’s challenges

Dedicating sufficient resources to the energy transition and its planning (in terms of infrastructure and value chain) is crucial for the future role of hydrogen as an enabler of the transition and green recovery. Green hydrogen is a niche product that is still very expensive. There are considerable uncertainties on the supply side, demand side and across its value chain.

The demand for hydrogen has risen three-fold since 1975. But it is mainly derived from fossil fuels. About 6% of global natural gas and 2% of global coal is going into hydrogen production. This hydrogen is mainly used in refining and fertilisers. However, for hydrogen to play a meaningful role in the energy transition, carbon-neutral hydrogen will need to be produced at the right scale to support the decarbonisation of the steel industry, the power sector, refining, chemicals, petrochemicals, fertilisers, and cement by 2050. And its scarcity for the next decade is well known.

This will require investment, according to Tudor Constantinescu of DG ENER, who is also confident that hydrogen will generate growth, employment and put the EU on track for 2050. Indeed, the Hydrogen Council predicts €2.5 trillion revenues from hydrogen by 2050, and 30 million jobs created worldwide.

Hydrogen in China

For China, hydrogen can also play a crucial role in powering its economic growth and recovery. China is already the largest hydrogen producer in the world, and production, storage, distribution and end use of hydrogen is expected to grow at an exponential rate. The latest commitment from China to reach carbon neutrality by 2060 will almost certainly require a ramp up of investments in transformative technologies such as green hydrogen.

Joachim von Scheele of Linde PLC, the world’s largest industrial gases company (which has 250 hydrogen production plants, one third of them with electrolysers), believes that it’s realistic for China to create a hydrogen economy as part of its 40-year long journey towards carbon neutrality. And, there are many potential opportunities for European companies to work in China, and for new alliances to be formed with Chinese companies.

Hydrogen can play an effective role in reducing emissions from the heavy industries such as cement and steel. As with many European countries, blue hydrogen produced with steam methane reforming of natural gas, with CCS, can be a stepping stone for creating demand and lead markets for green hydrogen in China.

Similar to the approach taken in Europe, hydrogen is also considered as an alternative fuel and decarbonisation pathway in the heavy transport sector in China, in particular for buses, trucks and trains.

Additionally, China is a large ship builder. Hence, there’s a great opportunity for many companies around the globe to cooperate.

Opportunities for Europe in China

The panel agreed that global hydrogen production has to rise 20-fold and there is room for everyone.

The EU Chamber of Commerce China Energy Working Group, chaired by panellist Mickael Naouri of Air Liquide, provides a strong platform to build bridges and facilitate discussions among government agencies, SMEs and large companies.

Mickael told us that there are already about 50 OEMs working today on new models for fuel cell vehicles in China. And where China is lagging behind technologically, European can bring technology transfer and promote innovation in electrolysis and liquefaction technologies. Indeed, the European Clean Hydrogen Alliance, representing over 100 European companies, has been launched to facilitate a robust investment agenda.

The fact that 95% of hydrogen is not renewable today should not defer investment. Partnerships and cooperation across the globe, and in particular between early-movers, will be crucial for the future energy system, which will be much more complex.

Certification, definitions, regulations

The international dimension of the hydrogen economy remains largely unexplored, due to uncertainties around certification, definitions and regulations. Even at the regional and national levels in Europe there is not sufficient clarity on which regulation applies access to pipeline networks and costs, and how to integrated hydrogen production plants.

In the context of China and EU cooperation, further dialogue is necessary on issues around economic regulation but also on intellectual property protection.

Investment

When it comes to financing the hydrogen economy in China, the perception is that there are sufficient venture capital movements and interest in hydrogen, according to Joachim and Mickael, with an active start-up community financed to develop technologies. These investments are likely to be redirected more towards the energy transition and climate smart technologies following the Chinese announcement of carbon neutrality by 2060.

Let’s not forget that China has swiftly became a global leader in batteries, and fuel cell vehicles may follow the same trajectory, with a difference that this time the drive may not be subsidy driven but driven by mandates by OEM manufacturers. In China, there is already an unprecedented target of 100,000 sales of fuel cell vehicles by 2025, announced by Chinese automakers. The Chinese private sector is pivotal to its economy. And there appears to be opportunities here for European firms in the emerging Chinese hydrogen market.

The global picture

Over the last couple of years, interest in green hydrogen technology has grown exponentially. The first European Hydrogen Week 2020 which took place in November attracted over 2,500 participants across the globe. Hydrogen as part of ‘net-zero’ efforts could indeed pave the way for reoriented firms to move into offshore wind and renewable hydrogen using existing oil and gas infrastructure. This would be welcome as the 2020 Production Gap report finds that the world needs to decrease fossil fuel production by 6% per year to limit global warming to 1.5°C.

However, reliance on technological improvements to enable the transition comes with a range of risks: for example, development and commercialisation of proposed new technologies may be severely delayed and investments in fossil fuel-based hydrogen may lead to lock-in.

Furthermore, the main focus has been around the different colors of hydrogen, its versatility, and the variety of hydrogen transport and storage options. Green hydrogen is considered as a prominent solution for the decarbonisation of hard to abate sectors of the economy and a crucial contributor towards reaching the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. But many of the applications of low-carbon and carbon neutral hydrogen are not available today, and investments envisaged today must materialise in the next 5 to 25 years.

Finally, as we prepare for a greener future, facilitated by hydrogen and many other climate smart technologies, are we missing out on delivering on inclusivity? I invite you to join Women in Green Hydrogen (WiGH), a bottom up, crowdsourced initiative set up to increase the visibility of female professionals working on hydrogen, which emerged from the need to ensure that the female workforce is not excluded from the discourse about hydrogen technology’s future.
