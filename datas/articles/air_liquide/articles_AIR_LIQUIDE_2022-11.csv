Under a long-term contract, committing TotalEnergies to purchase the hydrogen produced for the needs of its platform, Air Liquide will invest over 130 million euros in the construction and operation of a new unit producing hydrogen. This unit will partly use biogas from the biorefinery built by TotalEnergies, and will be delivered with Air Liquide’s carbon capture technology, CryocapTM. These innovations will prevent emissions amounting to 150,000 tonnes of CO2 a year compared to current processes. TotalEnergies’ biorefinery will use the unit’s hydrogen to produce sustainable aviation fuel.

In line with the two companies’ shared ambition to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, this project is based on an innovative sustainable and circular approach:

Air Liquide will build and operate at the Grandpuits site a new hydrogen production unit with an annual capacity of more than 20,000 tonnes. By recycling, in part, residual biogases from Grandpuits’ biorefinery as a substitute for the natural gas traditionally used, the hydrogen produced by this unit will be partly renewable.

In addition, this unit will include, from its start-up, an Air Liquide Cryocap™ H2 carbon capture unit . This will enable to capture, for reuse in agri-food and industrial applications, over 110,000 tonnes of CO2 per year contributing to reducing the site’s carbon footprint.

Most of the renewable and low-carbon hydrogen produced will be used by the biorefinery to produce sustainable aviation fuel . This hydrogen could also be used to support sustainable mobility in the Ile-de-France region .

Pascal Vinet, Senior Vice President and a member of Air Liquide’s Executive Committee, supervising notably Europe Industries activities, said : ""This innovative project is characterized by the combination of several solutions in order to produce renewable and low-carbon hydrogen, and contribute to the decarbonization of TotalEnergies’ Grandpuits site. It also provides the opportunity to recycle CO2 as part of a circular economy approach while securing its supply for agri-food applications. This project illustrates Air Liquide’s expertise in working with its customers on customized solutions to help them reduce their carbon footprint and actively participate in the fight against global warming. It provides yet another example of the key role that hydrogen will play to succeed in the energy transition"".

""By recycling the biogas produced by the biorefinery into renewable hydrogen, this innovative project makes full use of the conversion of the Grandpuits refinery into a zero crude platform harnessing the potential of biomass, especially in the production of sustainable aviation fuel,” said Bernard Pinatel, President, Refining & Chemicals, TotalEnergies.""Combined with the production of low carbon hydrogen and the capture of CO2, this project contributes to TotalEnergies’ ambition to decarbonize all of the hydrogen used by its European refineries by 2030."""

It also includes plans to ramp up hydrogen buses to 41,000 and outlines an objective to supply 15 GW of fuel cell power generation.

Hydrogen Council founding member Air Liquide is contributing to this ambitious national hydrogen mobility plan. Together with multiple local partners, Air Liquide is developing the sector across the entire value chain: production, storage, distribution, application and several large scale projects.

Developing large scale hydrogen filling centers

Air Liquide is focusing on the heavy duty market development with high pressure filling centers and liquid hydrogen investment to sustain its growth.

In May 2022, Air Liquide and Lotte Chemical entered a joint venture to scale-up the hydrogen supply chain for mobility markets in the country. The companies will co-invest through the joint venture in a new generation of large scale hydrogen filling centers in Daesan and Ulsan, allowing them to serve three of the country’s most densely populated regions, including the Seoul metropolitan area.

Air Liquide and Lotte Chemical also expect multiple synergies and envision the development of several opportunities to foster the rise of the hydrogen economy in Korea. Air Liquide will bring its expertise in design, manufacturing and operation of key hydrogen technologies including for hydrogen conditioning and distribution, and hydrogen refueling stations. Lotte Chemical will bring its access to large quantities of hydrogen, from its own off-gas sources located in Korea’s main industrial basins of Daesan and Ulsan. These sites are strategically located to host the conditioning hubs and refueling stations, and leverage demand in hydrogen for its own fleet of trucks group wide.

Making Incheon International Airport hydrogen ready

In the same spirit, Air Liquide aims to help decarbonize the aviation sector. In February 2022, Air Liquide, Airbus, Korean Air and Incheon International Airport Corporation signed a Memorandum of Understanding to explore the use of hydrogen at Incheon International Airport. More globally, the collaboration will also study the development of a Korean airport infrastructure to support the deployment of hydrogen-powered commercial aircrafts. This partnership reflects a shared ambition to drive the emergence of an innovative aviation sector dedicated to supporting the Korean government’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2050.

In addition, the airport currently counts two high-capacity hydrogen refueling stations that were developed by Air Liquide, which will also supply the molecule under a long-term contract. The goal of Incheon International Airport Corporation is to gradually upgrade its current fleet of shuttle buses with hydrogen buses. A project that also includes Hyundai Motor Company (hydrogen buses) and HyNet (station operator).

Deploying advanced hydrogen station networks

In the downstream market, considering Korea is leading world-wide adoption of hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles, alongside Germany, Japan and California, Air Liquide is participating in the HyNet (Hydrogen Network) consortium with 13 companies, with the goal to deploy a nationwide network of hydrogen refueling stations.

In March 2021, Air Liquide entered into another consortium named KOHYGEN to build hydrogen stations for buses and trucks. KOHYGEN targets to build and operate 300 heavy duty hydrogen stations by 2040.

Air Liquide is proud to be part of those key projects that support the development of Korea’s hydrogen economy. In line with its global Sustainable Development Objectives, Air Liquide is committed to continue to invest into and develop hydrogen technologies and solutions that can contribute to a more sustainable future."

About TotalEnergies in Grandpuits

Commissioned in 1966, Total's Grandpuits-Bailly-Carrois refinery was for a long time the only refinery in the Paris region. In September 2020, TotalEnergies launched a project to convert the site, in line with its strategy to become carbon neutral by 2050. This zero-crude project, with a total investment of more than 500 million euros, is based on the development of several future-oriented activities in the field of biomass, renewable energies, and the circular economy: chemical recycling of plastic waste, production of biosourced and biodegradable bioplastics, production of biofuels for the aviation sector, construction of a solar farm and electricity storage by batteries. The start-up of these new units will begin in 2022, and they should all be operational by 2025.

TotalEnergies and renewable & low-carbon hydrogen

TotalEnergies is convinced that renewable and low-carbon hydrogen will play a major role in the energy transition. The Company is working with its suppliers and partners to decarbonize all the hydrogen used in its European refineries by 2030. This represents a reduction in CO2 emissions of 3 million tons per year. Further out, TotalEnergies aims to pioneer the mass production of renewable and low carbon hydrogen to meet demand for hydrogen fuel as soon as the market takes off, notably to help decarbonize heavy transport. The renewable hydrogen production capacity currently under development in Europe and India will contribute to TotalEnergies' ambition for new molecules - biofuels, biogas, hydrogen, and e-fuels- to reach 25% of its energy production and sales mix by 2050.



TotalEnergies and Sustainable Aviation Fuels

TotalEnergies is developing Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF). These are biofuels produced from waste and residues from the circular economy (animal fats, used cooking oils, etc.) and ""e-jets"", synthetic fuels for aviation. These sustainable aviation fuels will significantly reduce CO2 emissions from air transport

TotalEnergies lets contract for Grandpuits refinery-to-renewables project - Oil & Gas Journal,"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5vZ2ouY29tL2VuZXJneS10cmFuc2l0aW9uL2FydGljbGUvMTQyODYxNzEvdG90YWxlbmVyZ2llcy1sZXRzLWNvbnRyYWN0LWZvci1ncmFuZHB1aXRzLXJlZmluZXJ5LXRvLXJlbmV3YWJsZXMtcHJvamVjdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TotalEnergies SE has let a contract to Air Liquide SA to supply renewable, low-carbon hydrogen for production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as part of the operator’s Project Galaxie repurposing of its 101,000-b/d Grandpuits refinery at Seine-et-Marne near Melun in northern France. TotalEnergies intends to convert the site into a zero-crude industrial platform by 2025 (OGJ Online, Sept. 28, 2020).

As part of the long-term supply contract, Air Liquide will invest more than €130 million to build and operate a grassroots hydrogen production unit (HPU) based on its proprietary Cryocap carbon-capture technology, TotalEnergies and Air Liquide said Nov. 22.

Configured to partly use recycled residual biogas from the SAF biorefinery under construction at Grandpuits, the new HPU will produce more than 20,000 tonnes/year (tpy) of renewable, low-carbon hydrogen, most of which will be returned to the biorefinery to enable additional SAF production.

By replacing natural gas typically used to produce hydrogen with the biorefinery’s recycled residual biogas, the HPU will reduce carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions by about 150,000 tpy compared with existing hydrogen production process, while its use of Cryocap technology will capture more than 110,000 tpy of CO 2 for reuse in food and industrial applications, according to the companies.

Alongside supporting the operator’s conversion of Grandpuits into a zero-crude industrial platform, TotalEnergies and Air Liquide said the combined low-carbon, CO 2 -capturing HPU project at Grandpuits is part of a broader collaboration to support TotalEnergies’ plan to decarbonize all hydrogen used at its European refineries by 2030.

This latest contract for the more than €500-million Project Galaxie at Grandpuits follows TotalEnergies’ recent agreement with SARIA AS GmbH & Co. KG to partner on SAF production at the site (OGJ Online, Sept. 26, 2022).

Already under way, Project Galaxie includes construction of the new biorefinery that will use Honeywell UOP LLC’s proprietary UOP Ecofining technology to process what initially was planned to be 400,000 tpy of mostly animal fats from Europe and used cooking oil—supplemented with other vegetable oils like rapeseed but excluding palm oil—primarily from local suppliers to produce 170,000 tpy of SAF; 120,000 tpy of renewable diesel; and 50,000 tpy of renewable naphtha for production of bioplastics.

TotalEnergies—which discontinued crude oil refining at Grandpuits in first-quarter 2021 and will cease storage of petroleum products at the site by late 2023—most recently said it remains on schedule to commission new units at Grandpuits in 2022-24 to reach full operation of the zero-crude platform by 2025.

Supplying SAF to French aircraft operators since 2021, TotalEnergies also began producing SAF in early 2022 at its 253,000-b/d integrated Normandy refining and petrochemicals platform in Gonfreville l’Orcher, France (OGJ Online, Apr. 28, 2022).

The company also has confirmed it is working on pilot units near its 227,000-b/d Leuna refinery in central Germany to make molecules that can be converted into methanol and SAF using green hydrogen and captured CO 2 (OGJ Online, Sept. 19, 2022).

The downstream projects are part of TotalEnergies’ broader commitment to achieve net-zero emissions across its global operations by 2050 in accord with its commitments under the Paris Agreement."

I am very pleased that it is now also possible to refuel with hydrogen in the Düren district.

“This is another important building block in our hydrogen strategy. The filling station is enormously important to further advance the innovation topic of hydrogen.”

Nik Asbach, Managing Director of Rurtalbus, said:

Rurtalbus GmbH is pleased to be able to use the state-of-the-art hydrogen filling station in such a convenient location for the hydrogen fleet with immediate effect.

“This hydrogen filling station represents an important infrastructure facility for the steadily growing hydrogen bus fleet for the next few years and is an essential building block for the stepwise conversion of the bus fleet to hydrogen.”

Hydrogen is used to power FCEVs (fuel cell electric vehicles). Their advantages: no noise and no pollutants, but the same use, speed, and range as vehicles with petrol or diesel engines. Hydrogen cars have ranges of up to 700 kilometres and refuel in just three to five minutes; buses, like conventional buses, need about 15 minutes to refuel, for a range of up to 300 kilometres.

The Düren hydrogen station is conveniently located on the A4 motorway and closes the supply gap between Cologne and Aachen. The station complements the 19 hydrogen filling stations in NRW to date. The district of Düren already operates three H2 vehicles in its fleet, as well as five hydrogen buses. Hydrogen cars are also in use in neighbouring municipalities.

Once the Brainergy Park in Jülich is completed, the filling station can be supplied with green, regeneratively produced hydrogen. Europe’s leading operator of hydrogen filling stations, H2 MOBILITY Deutschland, is responsible for the hydrogen filling station’s construction and operation.

The filling station technology at the new H2 filling station is supplied by the industrial gases and technology company Air Liquide. More than 500 kilograms of hydrogen are stored at the station, and vehicles can be refuelled at two pressure levels, 700 and 350 bar. The Federal Ministry of Digital Affairs and Transport funded the construction of the hydrogen filling station with a total of EUR 1.37 million under its National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology Innovation Programme.

The funding directive is coordinated by NOW GmbH and implemented by the Jülich Project Management (PtJ). The hydrogen filling station network in Germany Fuel-cell vehicle drivers can currently refuel cars, smaller commercial vehicles, and utility vehicles such as waste collectors at 700 bar at nearly 100 public hydrogen filling stations in Germany.

350-bar refuelling for buses and trucks is also possible at some of these stations. H2 MOBILITY continues to expand the hydrogen filling station infrastructure in focus regions and along the TEN-T corridors in line with demand. In addition, existing 700-bar hydrogen filling stations will be expanded short-term to include 350-bar pumps.

German Engineers Are One Step Closer to a Liquid Hydrogen-Electric Passenger Aircraft - autoevolution,"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdXRvZXZvbHV0aW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2dlcm1hbi1lbmdpbmVlcnMtYXJlLW9uZS1zdGVwLWNsb3Nlci10by1hLWxpcXVpZC1oeWRyb2dlbi1lbGVjdHJpYy1wYXNzZW5nZXItYWlyY3JhZnQtMjAzNDE5Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Project Heaven brought together several important names in European aerospace, including DLR, Pipistrel Vertical Solutions, Air Liquide Advanced Technologies (a cryogenic tank developer), and H2Fly, a company looking to develop a hydrogen-electric powertrain. The project has reached a new milestone with the successful testing of a liquid hydrogen tank for the HY4 aircraft.

A handful of engineers from the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the University of Ulm launched the H2Fly company with the goal of developing a regional aircraft with hydrogen-electric propulsion for commercial passenger flights. The four-seat prototype that’s been developed over the past decade is called HY4.Earlier this year, the HY4 hit two milestones. First, it became the first airplane of its kind to fly between two commercial airports after having completed a trip from Stuttgart to Friedrichshafen. Then, it claimed to have set a world altitude record as the first hydrogen-air-breathing aircraft to fly at 7,230 feet (2,203 meters).The project has recently reached another milestone. The liquid hydrogen tank integration began after the tank passed the vibration and leakage test. Over the next months, the tank and the fuel cells will be fully integrated into the aircraft. This should be completed by the end of the year, so that ground testing can be kicked off at the beginning of 2023.An efficient storage solution for liquid hydrogen is essential for future aircraft to be able to offer higher ranges – one of the most important requirements for regional operations H2Fly believes that this would be the world’s first passenger aircraft to use liquid hydrogen. The ultimate goal is to have a 40-passenger regional aircraft powered by liquid hydrogen, with a range of 2,000 km (1,243 miles). For this goal, H2Fly is working with Deutsche Aircraft on a CS25-class aircraft equipped with H2Fly’s fuel cell system. The prototype is expected to take to the sky by 2025."
H2FLY begins liquid hydrogen tank integration - The Engineer,"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWVuZ2luZWVyLmNvLnVrL2NvbnRlbnQvbmV3cy9oMmZseS1iZWdpbnMtbGlxdWlkLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLXRhbmstaW50ZWdyYXRpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"H2FLY, a Stuttgart-based developer of hydrogen fuel cell technologies, has begun the integration of a liquid hydrogen storage system tank into its HY4 aircraft.

According to the company, the process commenced following the liquid hydrogen tank passing the vibration and LH2 leakage testing phase at Air Liquide in September.

The announcement marks a significant step forward for Project HEAVEN – an initiative which has set out to design, develop and integrate a powertrain based on high-power fuel cell and cryogenic technology, into an existing aircraft for testing in-flight operation.

H2FLY supplies the complete fuel system supporting the HY4 aircraft, along with the integration platform and overall system architecture and controls of the fuel cell and hydrogen storage system. H2FLY said it will play a critical role as development lead in the coordination of the system implementation, ensuring each part is properly adapted to guarantee safe functionality.

Partners on the HEAVEN project include cryogenic tank supplier and designer Air Liquide Advanced Technologies, Pipistrel Vertical Solutions who will support the operation and testing of the tank, and DLR who will support operation and testing of the high power fuel cell and system architecture.

Integration work is expected to be completed over the coming months. Following this, the aircraft is planned to enter a ground testing programme in early 2023.

Prof. Dr Josef Kallo, co-founder and CEO of H2FLY, said that passing the vibration and leakage tests was a big step forward for delivering true zero-emissions flight with increased range.

“For the past ten years, at H2FLY we have been focused on developing and delivering new technology and now we look forward to completing the integration process so we can begin ground testing in preparation for the world’s first commercial liquid hydrogen-electric aircraft.”

The HY4, a four-seat aircraft with hydrogen-electric propulsion, first took flight in 2016. Key milestones for the company from the past two years include a strategic partnership with Deutsche Aircraft that will see the companies work together to fly a CS25 class aircraft powered by H2FLY’s hydrogen fuel cell tech, expected to fly for the first time as a prototype in 2025 and planned to have a 2,000km range.

Earlier this year, H2FLY completed a cross-country flight covering 77 miles, marking the first time a hydrogen-powered passenger plane has flown between two commercial airports. The company also set what is believed to be a world altitude record for a hydrogen-air-breathing aircraft this year, flying at 7,230 ft.

The HEAVEN project has received funding from the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen 2 Joint Undertaking (JU) under grant agreement No 826247. The JU receives support from the EU’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme and Spain, France, Germany and Solevenia."
