The chairmen of Air Liquide and Sinopec agree to study the development of hydrogen mobility network and the enhancement of the regulatory framework intrinsic to the development of hydrogen energy in China, home to the world’s largest mobility market. Under the agreement, Air Liquide will provide Sinopec with its hydrogen supply chain expertise, from production and storage to distribution, so as to provide competitive hydrogen supply solutions to the Chinese clean mobility markets.

Sinopec is the largest refining, as well as the second largest chemical and fuel retailer company in the world with a network of more than 30,000 retail stations. Air Liquide and Sinopec already have a long term partnership with three existing joint ventures supplying air gases to Sinopec facilities. Both companies also share a common vision on the role of hydrogen as part of the future energy mix.

A member of the Hydrogen Council since September 2018, Sinopec adheres to its vision that hydrogen is key to foster the energy transition. In view of the rapid development of the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell industry in China, Air Liquide and Sinopec are aligned on the need to develop a Hydrogen Energy infrastructure network.

Benoît Potier, Air Liquide Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said:

“We are delighted to strengthen our long term partnership with Sinopec in order to accelerate the rollout of concrete solutions for the development of hydrogen energy infrastructure in China. This initiative represents an important milestone for hydrogen mobility in this major country, home to the largest automotive market in the world. This partnership also illustrates Air Liquide’s contribution to the challenge of the energy transition and clean mobility by offering alternative energy solution, in line with the Group’s Climate objectives.”

North Las Vegas lands $150 million liquid hydrogen plant - Las Vegas Sun,"Mon, 11 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vbGFzdmVnYXNzdW4uY29tL25ld3MvMjAxOS9ub3YvMTEvbm9ydGgtbGFzLXZlZ2FzLWxhbmRzLTE1MC1taWxsaW9uLWxpcXVpZC1oeWRyb2dlbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"North Las Vegas lands $150 million liquid hydrogen plant

Leaders in North Las Vegas hope a planned liquid hydrogen plant will attract more development to the city's Apex Industrial Park.

Air Liquide, a French industrial gas company, has its sights on the 18,000-acre park to build a $150 million production plant.

Construction is expected to start early next year, city officials said. The company did not say how many people would be employed to build or operate the plant.

North Las Vegas started working with Air Liquide on the deal six months ago and finalized it in October.

""This is a significant milestone for the development of Apex Industrial Park,"" North Las Vegas City Manager Ryann Juden said.

""Apex has been recognized as a valuable location for the implementation of a new advanced production facility. Innovative companies like Air Liquide continue to put Apex on the map,"" Juden said.

The plant will help the company expand its distribution network in the Southwest, Air Liquide spokeswoman Cassandra Mauel said.

While most of the liquid hydrogen — used mainly to power vehicles — will go to customers in California, Nevada was a more attractive location for the production plant, Mauel said.

""Nevada offers local incentives, a competitive permitting process and competitive utilities, and the North Las Vegas site fits all of the characteristics that we were looking for,"" Mauel said.

City spokesman Patrick Walker said bringing the company to North Las Vegas is part of a wider effort to attract development. ""We really have been working hard to recruit green companies like these,"" he said. ""We are open for business.""

The city has made strides in the last two years on infrastructure to make Apex more feasible for companies like Air Liquide. Last summer, the city held a ground-breaking ceremony for a 12-mile surface water pipeline that should be finished next year.

""More new money will be made here in the next 20 years than anywhere else in the region, and Air Liquide will be a key part of that,"" North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee said."

The two hydrogen stations are part of the first project jointly signed by Sinopec and Air Liquide, which will lead Shanghai on the path to becoming a hydrogen energy harbor and further support the development of the 'Hydrogen Corridor'.

The two stations are secondary gas and hydrogen fueling stations; each is equipped with two gasoline tanks, two diesel tanks and four hydrogen tanks, as well as two 12-pump fuel dispensers, two four-pump 35MPa hydrogen dispensers and a reserved 70MPa hydrogen dispenser. The pipelines of the two stations were constructed per the upgraded 70MPa standard to meet the needs of both 35MPa and 70MPa car owners.

Equipped with the world's most advanced technologies, the two combined gas and hydrogen fueling stations have a daily capacity of 1,000 kilograms to serve public transportation, logistics and passenger vehicles. Each station can fuel 100 cars a day. A full tank can be provided in 4-6 minutes per vehicle, providing a driving distance of 300 to 400 kilometers (186.41-248.55 miles).

Unlike previous petrol and hydrogen fueling stations that separate gas and hydrogen, the new project combines them. Sinopec achieved this by recycling the former gas station to create a secondary energy complex. The benefits of this innovative new concept of construction results it better land conservation, reduced waste and lower safety risks.

According to the midterm goal of ""Shanghai Fuel Cell Vehicle Development Plan,"" the city will complete 50 hydrogen stations by 2025. To achieve this, Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical will utilize the land from 580 existing gas stations to fast-track the introduction of a new generation national network of stations covering urban roads and highways, for a reduced carbon future.

Senegal: promoting broader access to medical oxygen with Access Oxygen - Air Liquide,"Fri, 29 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvaGVhbHRoY2FyZS9zZW5lZ2FsLXByb21vdGluZy1icm9hZGVyLWFjY2Vzcy1tZWRpY2FsLW94eWdlbi1hY2Nlc3Mtb3h5Z2Vu0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Marie-Paule Battista and Abdoulahi Sarr, Access Oxygen intrapreneurs at Air Liquide, are working hand in hand to deploy oxygen therapy treatments to small health centers in rural and periurban areas in Senegal. An interview.

Can you give us an overview of the Access Oxygen project? Abdoulahi Sarr: Access Oxygen is one of the Group's Inclusive Business projects that aims to promote and expand access to a comprehensive, sustainable medical oxygen solution for small healthcare centers in Senegal. It facilitates local treatment of health emergencies such as acute asthma, fetal distress, respiratory failure and many other pathologies. This avoids transferring patients to regional hospitals, which are often several kilometers away and accessed via dangerous transportation modes. Marie-Paule Battista: We work every day to improve our solution so that it is more affordable for the Senegalese people so we can widen our health and social impact. What does your day-to-day work consist of? M-P.B.: I train midwives and nurses to use our kit. It includes an oxygen concentrator, a pulse oximeter, an oxygen cylinder and a very helpful digital app that assists them in caring for patients. A.S.: Being an ""intrapreneur"" in this region requires that you be familiar with and have a firm grasp on the region's health ecosystem to build an offer that is suited to the small healthcare facilities. Our solution includes a comprehensive kit, as well as a preventive and corrective maintenance system for the equipment, training for medical personnel and education for local communities. My customers call me regularly with practical questions and I call on them every three months to check that everything is working. Finally, to promote an oxygen culture to the local population, we periodically hold village meetings organized by the chief nurse focusing on how useful and important oxygen is to our health.

“ We are proud to say that, just one year after launching Access Oxygen, we have enabled the treatment of over 1,000 patients, 200 of whom needed it for survival. ” Abdoulahi Sarr Access Oxygen intrapreneur at Air Liquide

What makes this initiative innovative? A.S.: We are reaching a new market that was not previously covered by the Group: the population at the bottom of the pyramid (the 4 billion people around the world who earn less than $10 per day). We are highlighting the health and social impact of our activities. This research is just as important to us as a profitability objective. For us, the customer is our top priority each day as we strive to properly care for patients. M-P.B.: For my area, I have developed a funding mode based on sponsorship: the first year is paid for by a local company. We have discovered that the most time-consuming stage is actually getting the healthcare facility to sign the first contract. However, we have seen that once they implement our solution, they renew the contract. We simply needed a way to speed up the process What is your favorite part of your work? A.S: Traveling throughout Senegal, feeling like I am helping the people and working with motivated practitioners to advance wellness for all. And hearing spontaneous first-hand accounts from customers who are happy with Access Oxygen! M-P.B.: Like Abdoulahi, what I like is exploring Senegal each day and each day providing a real service to small healthcare facilities and, therefore, to the patients who need it. Each sales call is like an adventure. And I am discovering a new culture that I did not know before.

“ Prospecting is a job that has its share of challenges since each healthcare structure has its own decision-making body, the ""healthcare committee"" that includes a doctor or a nurse along with community representatives. ” Marie-Paule Battista Access Oxygen intrapreneur at Air Liquide

How do you complement each other? A.S.: Marie-Paule and I make a good team. She is excellent with communication tools. On my end, I bring her the technical support. We talk to one another and we each share our ideas and feedback from the field. And our teamwork is paying off: we are treated as fully fledged participants in the Senegalese health system by medical professionals and patients, as well as public institutions and the international organizations on the ground. It's a fine reward!"

Air Liquide's Chief Executive Benoit Potier and Sinopec Group Chairman Dai Houliang signed the agreement at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing yesterday while discussing heightened cooperation in the hydrogen energy field, Sinopec said in a statement the same day. It did not disclose when it will found the new firm or how much Air Liquide would invest.

Sinopec is in the midst of setting up a new company dedicated to the research and development of hydrogen energy and construction of related infrastructure. It hopes to bring on board leading international companies in the sector as long-term investors to help build an industrial chain and ecosystem for the industry.

The two firms are no strangers to one another, having founded three joint ventures in the past. One of these is a 50-50 joint venture named Air Liquide-BYPC Gases.

Through the latest company, Air Liquide and Sinopec will push new applications for hydrogen energy and fuel-cell vehicles and promote these across China, the statement added.

State-owned Sinopec began moving into the hydrogen industry chain in September when it picked up a stake in Shanghai Re-Fire Technology, a domestic supplier of hydrogen fuel cell systems. Its 117-year-old partner already has a wealth of experience in the sector, having built nearly 120 hydrogen stations around the world.

Macquarie tipped to buy Korea’s top industrial gas producer for $2.2 bn - Korea Economic Daily,"Thu, 07 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtlZGdsb2JhbC5jb20vaW5mcmFzdHJ1Y3R1cmUvbmV3c1ZpZXcva2VkMjAxOTExMDcwMDAx0gExaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAua2VkZ2xvYmFsLmNvbS9uZXdzQW1wL2tlZDIwMTkxMTA3MDAwMQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Macquarie Group has approached MBK Partners to acquire Daesung Industrial Gases Co. Ltd. and offered around 2.5 trillion won ($2.2 billion) for full ownership of the South Korean company, in a deal that would generate proceeds of more than 700 billion won for MBK in almost three years.

The Australia-based investment bank is now undertaking a due diligence study on the largest industrial gas producer in South Korea, aiming to sign a share purchase agreement (SPA) in December, sources with knowledge of the matter told the Korean Investors earlier this week.

Separately, Macquarie was chosen on Nov. 6 as the preferred buyer of a 35% stake in LG CNS Co. Ltd., an IT services firm of the LG Group, in a transaction worth 1 trillion won. It is set to enter into an SPA with LG Corp. which has a majoriry stake in the IT unit, within this month, according to other sources.

It beat other private equity firms TPG Capital and PAG, formerly known as Pacific Alliance Group, in the auction.

“Industrial gas companies are favorite targets of PEFs because of their high entry barriers and stable earnings outlook,” one of the sources told the Korean Investors.

“The global gas industry has been undergoing a reorganization over the past few years, which is pushing the bidding prices higher.”

Daesung Industrial was set up as a joint venture between Air Liquide, a French company, Daesung Industrial Co. Ltd. in 1979.

It supplies gases to Korean semiconductor companies in long-term contracts.

Its operating profit rose by 27% to 93.8 billion won in 2018 from a year before, on sales of 566.6 billion won which is up 5%.

Macquarie has been ramping up private equity business in South Korea.

Last year, it acquired ADT Caps, a Korean security services firm, in a consortium with SK Telecom Co Ltd. for $2.5 billion.

Seoul-based MBK Partners has been exiting from previous investments ahead of its fifth fund launch. Earlier this year, it retrieved 1.7 trillion won from the sale of a Korean water purifier rental company.

For the non-controlling stake in LG CNS, Macquarie won higher scores than KKR in non-price factors such as global strategy and business cooperation plans with LG Group, according to the sources.

KKR had made attractive offers with a similar bid price to Macquarie’s.

Sinopec May Open a Greenfield Refinery Complex in South China - Yahoo Finance,"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9zaW5vcGVjLW1heS1vcGVuLWdyZWVuZmllbGQtcmVmaW5lcnktMTQ1ODAyNDc3Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation SNP, also known as Sinopec, is planning to open a new refinery and petrochemical complex in the June quarter of 2020, according to Reuters. The $5.7-billion complex in SouthChina will reportedly be getting crude as a feedstock from Kuwait.

Notably, the unit is the third greenfield refinery and petrochemical complex that is being constructed in China in just a two-year span. The plant is expected to have a refining capacity of 200,000 barrels per day (Bbl/D).

Investors should know that the project will have a hydrocracker, a residue fluid catalytic cracker, a diesel hydrotreater and a reformer. This will enable the refining complex to produce low sulphur fuel. A naphtha cracker, with a capacity of 800,000 ton-per-year, and some petrochemical plants will be integrated with the refining complex, per the source.

Since the refinery and petrochemical unit will be producing low sulphur fuel, the Zhanjiang complex will have an edge over other units as the global marine fuel emission rules set by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) are going to be more stringent starting next year.

With regards to feedstock, Sinopec is reportedly in a plan to secure crude supply agreement with Kuwait Petroleum Company. With this, the crude sales to China from Kuwait will jump to a record mark of roughly 600,000 Bbl/D in 2020, the source revealed.

Separately, Sinopec announced the inauguration of two hydrogen stations in Shanghai. In collaboration with French company Air Liquide, the integrated energy player opened up the stations to make Shanghai a hydrogen energy harbour.

Headquartered in Beijing, Sinopec currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). A few better-ranked players in the energy space are Murphy USA Inc MUSA, CNX Resources Corporation CNX and Contango Oil & Gas Company MCF.

Macquarie to acquire Daesung Industrial Gases from MBK: reports - The Investor,"Mon, 04 Nov 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vbS50aGVpbnZlc3Rvci5jby5rci92aWV3LnBocD91ZD0yMDE5MTEwNDAwMDc4MtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Macquarie to acquire Daesung Industrial Gases from MBK: reports

Australian private equity fund Macquarie is poised to acquire South Korea’s Daesung Industrial Gases from MBK Partners, local business newspaper Hankuk Business Daily reported on Nov. 3.



Macquarie is set to buy 100 percent in the gas company for about 2.5 trillion won ($2.15 billion), the report said.



The company provides industrial gases to local semiconductor companies with long-term contracts.









In 2017, MBK Partners, a leading Korean PEF, bought the company with management rights for 1.8 trillion won.



Daesung’s sales were up 5 percent to 566.6 billion won on-year in 2018 and its operating profit rose 27 percent to 93.8 billion won.



The deal is expected to be completed by mid-December after a due diligence process.



If it closes successfully, Macquarie will become the fourth owner of the company in five years.



Daesung was founded as a joint venture between Daesung Industries and Air Liquide, a French company, in 1979. In May 2014, Goldman Sachs Principal Investment Area bought 60 percent stake in the company including 40 percent held by Air Liquide for 420 billion won. Following financial difficulties, Daesung decided to sell the remaining 40 percent in 2017 while Goldman Sachs was seeking to cash in its investment.



Macquarie acquired ADT Caps with SK Telecom last year and seeks to buy a minor stake in LG CNS.



MBK’s most recent notable exits include Woongjin Coway worth 1.68 trillion won.

A number of prominent passengers joined him for parts of the journey, including the CEO of Air Liquide, the Grand Duke of Luxembourg, and several prominent politicians

The purpose of the journey was to promote hydrogen technology as a high-performance solution for future mobility

French aeronaut and president of the Solar Impulse Foundation Bertrand Piccard has broken the world record for the longest distance traveled in a hydrogen-powered vehicle on a single refueling. Driving in a Hyundai Nexo, Piccard left the FaHyence hydrogen station in Sarreguemines on Monday 25 November, a place chosen because of the Grand Est Region's commitment to responsible mobility, and arrived the next day at the Musée de l'Air et de l'Espace in Le Bourget – a distance of 778 km. Never before has a production car powered by a hydrogen fuel cell covered so many kilometres on a single charge.

Accustomed to extraordinary challenges, including the first round-the-world trip in a balloon with Breitling Orbiter and the first round-the-world trip in a solar plane with Solar Impulse, this time Bertrand Piccard was able to take passengers along on this adventure. This was an opportunity for the adventurer and his guests to discover a new generation of car, to share their experiences in terms of environmental protection and to compare their points of view on sustainable development and mobility.

In the passenger seat alongside Bertrand Piccard were:

Jean Rottner , President of the Grand Est Region (French)

Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg

Michel Delpon , MP for the Dordogne and President of the Hydrogen Study Group at National Assembly (French)

Benoît Potier , CEO of Air Liquide (French)

Bruno Le Maire , Minister of Economy and Finance (French)

Elisabeth Borne , Minister of Ecological and Solidarity Transition (French)

H.S.H. Prince Albert II of Monaco

Arrival of record was celebrated in the setting of ‘’Musée de l'Air et de l'Espace’’ in Le Bourget, a reference to Bertrand Piccard's aerial exploits. In his capacity as the new world distance record holder with a hydrogen vehicle, Bertrand Piccard, and Lionel French-Keogh, Managing Director of Hyundai Motor France, spoke in turn.

""With this adventure, we have proven that with clean technologies, we no longer need revolutionary experimental prototypes to break records. Everyone can now do it with standard zero-emission vehicles,” said Piccard. “A new era in performance is beginning, for the benefit of environmental protection”.

Lionel French-Keogh, Managing Director of Hyundai Motor France, continued:

""While some may doubt the relevance of hydrogen in tomorrow’s cars, we at Hyundai have believed in it since 1998, when we began our developments on this technology. Thanks to this record set by Bertrand Piccard, all doubt has been dispelled. As well as being listened to worldwide, Bertrand is a charismatic character who knows better than anyone how to raise awareness of climate issues. We share with him the conviction that it is possible to change our consumption in a sustainable way and hydrogen is an answer to this issue. We see respect for the environment as a vector for growth and not as an obstacle to innovation.”

As the first car manufacturer to mass produce hydrogen-powered vehicles, Hyundai is actively preparing for tomorrow's zero emission mobility. Avoiding any dogmatic position on alternative energies, the brand is already responding to current changes in the car market by offering the widest choice of electrified powertrains on the market.

Bertrand Piccard is committed to the planet through the challenge of 1000 Efficient and Profitable Solutions to Protect the Environment, which he initiated with the Solar Impulse Foundation. Hyundai Motor France shares the same vision of sustainable growth and has used him as its ambassador since 2017.

Hyundai Motor France and Bertrand Piccard organised a major conference in Paris in September 2018, which, for the first time brought together all the players in the hydrogen sector in France.



Record key figures: Number of kilometers traveled: 778km

Remaining range displayed on the counter: 49km

Air purification: 404.6 kL, the volume of air that 23 adults breathe every day

However, atomic hydrogen can be absorbed in metallic materials and cause material degradation in the form of hydrogen embrittlement. Therefore, HyLINE will address the pipeline material challenges related to transporting clean hydrogen gas in the existing subsea pipeline infrastructure for natural gas transport as well as new pipeline infrastructure.

To tackle this challenge SINTEF and NTNU work with industrial partners from all parts of the chain in the hydrogen economy as well as leading research environments in the world on the effects of HE on metals. Gassco, Total E & P and Equinor, two of the main industrial actors involved in the realisation and potential decision makers of Norway as a large-scale exporter of hydrogen gas, are involved in the project. TechnipFMC is an important company for design and construction of subsea technology needed for this to happen, while NEL and Air Liquide address the production, transport and storage of hydrogen gas. The steel and pipeline producer TenarisDalmine is an international industry partner.

HyLINE gain from close research collaboration with Kyushu University in Japan, Max Planck Instiute für Eisenforschung in Germany and the Univerity of Poitiers, France.

Industry partners: Equinor, Gassco, TechnipFMC, AirLiquide, NEL, TenarisDalmine, Total E&P

“Regular contacts at the highest level also indicate the high level of relations between the two states. We expect that the upcoming visit of President Emmanuel Macron to Kazakhstan will give a new impetus to bilateral cooperation,” the Head of State said.

Currently, there are more than 160 companies with French capital in Kazakhstan, including such TNCs as Orano, Alstom, Air Liquide, Airbus and others. The trade turnover between the countries in 2018 increased by 32% and amounted to US$ 4.5 billion.

“I think this is a very good indicator, however, we should all strive to constantly improve it. Positive dynamics is maintained in the current year. Over 9 months, the trade turnover has been increased by 5.5% and amounted to US$ 3.4 billion. As for now, the total volume of French investments into Kazakhstan’s economy in various spheres is about US$ 16 billion,” the President said.

Kassym-Jomart Tokayev stressed that Kazakhstan has provided conditions for successful business, implemented systemic reforms aimed at improving the business climate, reducing barriers and increasing the investment attractiveness of the country.

The President drew the attention of French businessmen to a wide range of areas for expanding cooperation and invited them to partner in the implementation of joint projects in the agricultural sector and other sectors of the economy.

“Kazakhstan has wide opportunities in the production of competitive agricultural products. Our country has 25 million hectares of arable land and more than 186 million hectares of pastures. These are huge resources and reserves. Geographically, we are close to the Chinese, European, middle Eastern and Indian markets, which have a large capacity and good solvency,” the Head of State shared the prospects of cooperation.

The importance of cooperation in innovation and digital economy was also noted in the speech. Kassym-Jomart Tokayev also called to expand cooperation in the financial sector and engagement in the activities of the Astana International Financial Centre.

“There are innovation clusters in the country, such as Nazarbayev University and the Park of innovative technologies. Astana Hub International Technopark of IT startups was opened. We are ready to create the most favorable conditions for the introduction of French innovations and technologies in Kazakhstan,” the President stressed.

Focusing on the development of Kazakhstan’s transit and transport infrastructure, the Head of State said that important international corridors connecting Asia and Europe via Kazakhstan, the “Nurly Zhol” programme is being implemented, which interfaced with the global Chinese initiative “One Belt, One Road”. In addition, in order to expand the transport and tourism potential, an Open Skies regime was introduced for the Kazakhstan's leading airports

“I have decided to open the sky over Kazakhstan. This regime has been introduced in 11 airports. This will lead to proper competition between all aviation companies, including Kazakh ones. Of course, this will have a beneficial effect on the aviation capabilities of our country in terms of not only the transportation of passengers, but also the organization of cargo flows between Kazakhstan and Europe,” Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said.

The President also confirmed the interest of our country in studying and implementing the successful French experience in tourism and emphasized his readiness to receive tourists from France in Kazakhstan.

In turn, co-Chairman of the Kazakh-French business Council Yves-Louis Darricarrère noted the desire of investors to develop joint projects with Kazakhstan.

“I would like to emphasize the aspiration and desire of French companies to develop collaboration with the Kazakh enterprises on a long-term basis. They hope to develop additional projects, indeed, they are determined to work with the Kazakh authorities,” Yves-Louis Darricarrère underscored.

The meeting was also addressed by Ahlem Friga-Noy, Head of Total Kazakhstan, Philippe Christodoulou, Vice President of Air Liquide, Didier Pfleger, Senior Vice President for the Middle East of Alstom, Nicolas Mohr, Senior Vice President of Renault, Isabelle Lauzon, Senior Vice President of IDEMIA, Nicolas Maes, CEO of Orano mining, Pietro Cala, Regional Director of Vicat and other representatives of the French business.

Following the meeting, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev expressed confidence that this event will contribute to the strengthening of the Kazakh-French relations, and be the beginning of new mutually beneficial projects."
