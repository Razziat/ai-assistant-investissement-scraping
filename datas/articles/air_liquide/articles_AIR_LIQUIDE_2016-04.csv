Sites of four Northeast hydrogen fueling stations announced by Air Liquide - Green Car Reports,"Fri, 08 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVuY2FycmVwb3J0cy5jb20vbmV3cy8xMTAzMzA3X3NpdGVzLW9mLWZvdXItbm9ydGhlYXN0LWh5ZHJvZ2VuLWZ1ZWxpbmctc3RhdGlvbnMtYW5ub3VuY2VkLWJ5LWFpci1saXF1aWRl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"California is the only U.S. state with substantial hydrogen fueling infrastructure, but now one company is giving the Northeast some attention.

Air Liquide plans to open a small network of public hydrogen fueling stations in three Northeastern states by early 2017.

The company—which has installed around 75 stations globally—will undertake this project with support from Toyota.

Four locations have already been chosen, with two stations slated for Massachusetts, and one each for New York and Connecticut.

The New York station will be located in the New York City borough of The Bronx, while the Connecticut station will be built in Hartford, the state capital.

The Massachusetts stations will be located in the Boston suburb of Braintree, and in Mansfield, closer to the Rhode Island border.

These four stations will provide at least some basic infrastructure should hydrogen fuel-cell car sales expand beyond California sometime soon.

Given its involvement in the fueling-station project, it's likely that Toyota is at least considering sales of its Mirai sedan in the Northeast.

The Mirai went on sale through eight California dealers last year, and even there lack of fueling infrastructure has posed a problem.

Earlier this year, Toyota asked some dealers to stop Mirai deliveries, because fewer stations were available than the company had anticipated.

Nonetheless, Toyota plans to increase U.S. Mirai deliveries from 1,000 for the 2016 model year to 3,000 by the end of 2017, which will necessitate wider availability of the highly-compressed gaseous fuel.

In addition to Toyota, Hyundai leases its Tucson Fuel Cell in select areas of California, and Honda plans to launch its Clarity Fuel Cell in the state later this year.

New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts all offer—or plan on offering—incentives for battery-electric cars, but Connecticut has also included fuel-cell cars in its incentive program.

The three states are part of an eight-state coalition working to put more zero-emission vehicles—both battery-electric and fuel—on the roads in their jurisdictions.

Along with California, Maryland, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Vermont, the goal is to have 3.3 million such vehicles on the road by 2025.

Teamsters End Strike at Airgas - International Brotherhood of Teamsters,"Fri, 29 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vdGVhbXN0ZXIub3JnLzIwMTYvMDQvdGVhbXN0ZXJzLWVuZC1zdHJpa2UtYWlyZ2FzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Drivers and plant operation workers at industrial gas company Airgas returned to work in March after ending a 24-hour strike.

The workers, members of Local 100 in Cincinnati, unanimously authorized a strike less than two weeks before the strike and went on strike on March 10 to protest Airgas’ violations of United States and international labor laws. The workers’ contract with the company expired on Nov. 30, 2015.

In February, Airgas shareholders approved the sale of the company to France-based Air Liquide.

“The strike by members of Local 100 was a message to Airgas and Air Liquide’s management that their American workers will not tolerate violations of labor laws or their human rights. We demand that Air Liquide direct Airgas management to stop the attacks on their dedicated and loyal American workers,” said Sam Bucalo, Secretary-Treasurer of Local 100.

“I’m proud of Local 100 Teamsters. Every one of its Airgas members stood up to Air Liquide on that picket line and declared, ‘Stop the attacks!’” said Keith Gleason, Teamsters Tankhaul Division Director. “The ball is in Airgas’ court now. We expect the company to stop violating the law, and that when negotiations resume April 5, they’ll drop what they termed their ‘throwaway proposals’ and get down to the business of negotiating in good faith.”

“Airgas violated United States labor laws that protect workers’ rights. Airgas management threatened to discipline a worker who is a union steward if he attended contract negotiations. Negotiating a contract is the basic right of workers’ unions. It’s completely unacceptable for the company to threaten workers for exercising their rights. The company also acted illegally when it unilaterally terminated workers’ 401(k) retirement funds — some workers could have huge tax bills as a result,” Bucalo said.

“Unbelievably, Air Liquide, a France-based company whose recent offer to purchase Airgas was overwhelmingly accepted by shareholders, has stood idly by and allowed these attacks on its American workers to continue,” Gleason said.

Bucalo said workers are telling Air Liquide, “Stop the attacks by your Airgas managers.” There was 100 percent participation on the strike line and no one crossed the line.

Gleason said Air Liquide’s Airgas has been abusing workers across America by locking them out during contract negotiations; threatening workers with loss of health care benefits and wages; and attempting to break its workers’ unions by illegally threatening union activists.

“This would never happen in their European operations,” Gleason said.

“We are angry about Airgas’ violations of our rights. Air Liquide needs to rein in its Airgas management and stop them from breaking United States and international laws. Now that we’re on strike, we know how important that is,” said Barry Perkins, chief steward and negotiation committee member. “Air Liquide’s Airgas management is so out-of-touch, they weren’t even at the facility this morning and didn’t know we were on strike until we were well into it.”"
Hydrogen-fueling hub proposed for Littleton - Wicked Local,"Thu, 21 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpY2tlZGxvY2FsLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9lYWdsZS1pbmRlcGVuZGVudC8yMDE2LzA0LzIxL2h5ZHJvZ2VuLWZ1ZWxpbmctaHViLXByb3Bvc2VkLWZvci82NDkwOTg0NTAwNy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hydrogen-fueling hub proposed for Littleton Ayer Road site could become a distribution center

A hydrogen-fueling hub by Houston-based gas company Air Liquide is one step closer to coming to Ayer Road in Littleton. Only a few remaining permits stand between Littleton becoming one of the first stops in a hydrogen fuel network on the East Coast.

The Planning Board unanimously voted to accept the project’s site plan review at its April 14 meeting and now Air Liquide representatives can apply for a building permit.

Air Liquide’s proposed 15,000-gallon distribution facility would be the first in a network of hydrogen infrastructure meant to prepare the Northeast for hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles, according to Planning Board Chairman Richard Crowley.

“It’s a small facility,” Crowley said. “It’ll hold a minimal amount of hydrogen because there aren’t a lot of gas stations yet.”

Hydrogen fuel cell electric cars use gaseous hydrogen and oxygen from the air to produce electricity with no emissions except water, according to Air Liquide Technical Expert Aaron Harris.

“You have zero emissions when you’re driving it on the road,” Harris said. “You’re not burning anything.”

By the end of Air Liquide’s Northeast infrastructure development, the region will have two distribution centers, including Littleton, servicing 12 fueling stations along the New York-Boston corridor, with nearby stations in Mansfield and Braintree, according to a company release dated April 7.

What is hydrogen fuel cell technology?

Hydrogen fueling is an electro-chemical process, according to Harris.

“That’s a fancy word for turning chemical energy into electrical energy,” said Harris.

The electricity produced by the electro-chemical process is stored in the fuel cell like a battery in a typical electric car, he added.

“The car itself is an electric vehicle,” Harris said. “It’s comparable to what you’re used to now.”

Because combustion vehicles use gasoline, which is measured in gallons, and hydrogen is measured in kilograms, it’s difficult to compare the costs of both fuel types, according to Harris.

But hydrogen cars can travel more efficiently using a full tank than their gasoline counterparts, added Harris.

One full tank of hydrogen in an average hydrogen fuel cell electric car has a range of 300 miles, he said.

“The comparable cost is $40-$50 per tank for that 300 miles,” Harris said. “Your hydrogen will use that energy more efficiently.”

Fueling time for hydrogen fuel cells is approximately five minutes, he added.

About the facility

The proposed Littleton facility will be located at a 62-acre site on Ayer Road. Liquid hydrogen would be delivered in large trucks and vaporized into gaseous form before being disseminated by tube trailer trucks to various smaller fueling stations in the region, according to Crowley.

“You’re not going to see any buildings,” said Crowley. “Just vertical tanks.”

The whole facility is in compliance with current safety codes, added Crowley.

“As with any other flammable material… the handling and storage of those things is regulated by the fire code and the building code,” Crowley said.

Hydrogen fuel is about as safe as the gasoline people use in vehicles today, said Harris, a comparison Littleton Fire Chief Scott Wodzinski agreed with.

“It’s an extremely light gas,” said Wodzinski. “If there was a leak… the gas is so light, that it dissipates into the atmosphere. It would be gone before we even got there.”

In addition to both active and passive fire safety systems, the site will be remotely monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week and will be staffed 10-12 hours a day, according to Harris.

Air Liquide will also provide the Littleton Fire Department with a thermal imaging device to help detect any potential leaks because hydrogen is invisible when it burns, according to Wodzinski.

Although the Planning Board approved two special permits and Air Liquide’s site plan review, the project is still before the Conservation Commission and will need a land use permit from the Board of Selectmen and a building permit from the Building Department before construction can begin, Planning Board Administrator Maren Toohill said.

The first of many

Air Liquide has partnered with Toyota to develop this hydrogen fuel infrastructure in the Northeast, but every fuel cell electric vehicle would be able to use the filling stations, according to Air Liquide Communications Manager Cassandra Franceschini.

The network would support the future introduction of fuel cell vehicles into the region such as the Toyota Mirai or the Mercedes-Benz B-Class F-Cell.

“These vehicles will be the first wave of (hydrogen) vehicles,” said Harris.

Mercedes-Benz has been developing fuel cell technology for over two decades and has produced everything from hydrogen fuel cell passenger vehicles to buses, according to Lora Renz, communication specialist for Mercedes-Benz Research and Development for U.S. Fuel Cell Operations.

However, these vehicles need the proper infrastructure to expand to the Eastern Seaboard, Renz said.

“The hydrogen fueling infrastructure… has been growing slowly, but is poised to grow substantially in the coming months and years,” Renz said in an email.

“We already have enough hydrogen… to power many more vehicles,” said Harris. “What we need is distribution.”

The Air Liquide hydrogen hub is an opportunity for the town to promote its environmental goals as well, according to Town Administrator Keith Bergman.

“I don’t think this facility will have a heavy (economic) impact on Littleton, but I do see it as a big symbol for Littleton that we support energy efficiency,” Crowley said.

Littleton was recently certified as a Massachusetts Green Community for the town’s efforts in clean energy and energy efficiency and a hydrogen fuel facility would be a chance to build on that, Bergman said.

“Littleton town officials have been very interested to learn more about Air Liquide’s plans to develop and supply a fully-integrated hydrogen fueling infrastructure in the northeast United States,” Bergman said in an email. “To have Littleton be the host community for one of the first hydrogen filling stations in the northeast for this joint venture to introduce hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles to the United States would be a unique opportunity to advance our sustainability principles as a Green Community.”

California is currently one of the only places in the country actively using hydrogen-fueled vehicles, but the technology is being developed in Germany and Japan as well, Harris said.

Although it will take time to develop hydrogen fuel cell infrastructure on the East Coast, Littleton could be at the forefront, according to Crowley.

“We’re the beginning… right here in Littleton,” said Crowley.

Air Products to Ditch Plasma Gasification Waste to Energy Plants in Teesside | WMW - Waste Management World,"Tue, 05 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd2FzdGUtbWFuYWdlbWVudC13b3JsZC5jb20vYXJ0aWtlbC9haXItcHJvZHVjdHMtdG8tZGl0Y2gtcGxhc21hLWdhc2lmaWNhdGlvbi13YXN0ZS10by1lbmVyZ3ktcGxhbnRzLWluLXRlZXNzaWRlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In an expensive about turn, Air Products is to exit the waste to energy sector and off-load its two trouble hit 50 MW plasma gasification plants on Teesside, North East England.

The company said that the decision was due to technical difficulties in making the technology work as expected.

Construction work on the second of the two facilities was suspended back in November 2015 as it became apparent that there were going to be operational challenges in making the facility function correctly.

The first of the two plants, TV1, had been undergoing testing and analysis during the Company’s fiscal second quarter. However, the results indicated that additional design and operational challenges would require significant time and cost to rectify.

Consequently, the Board of Directors have decided that it is no longer in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders to continue the Tees Valley waste to energy projects.

As a result, the company said that its Energy from Waste business segment will be accounted for as a discontinued operation effective in the its second fiscal quarter.

Also in the second quarter, Air Products said that expects to record a pre-tax charge in the range of $900 million to $1.0 billion in discontinued operations, primarily to write down assets associated with the Energy from Waste business to their current realisable value.

Air Products said that it will work to optimise the cash value of the investments, but expects a modest future cash tax benefit from the write-off.

The company added that exiting the Energy from Waste business will allow it to direct its resources to its core business of Industrial Gases.

“Air Products is focused on our core Industrial Gas business. We pushed very hard to make this new EfW technology work and I would like to thank the team who worked so diligently,” said Seifi Ghasemi, chairman, president and CEO of Air Products.

“We appreciate the hard work of our employees and contractors at the site, and certainly understand their disappointment in this decision. We are also disappointed with the outcome,” concluded Ghasemi"
2 hydrogen refueling stations to open in Massachusetts next year - Boston.com,"Fri, 08 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvc3Rvbi5jb20vY2Fycy9tYXNzYWNodXNldHRzLW5ld3MvMjAxNi8wNC8wOC8yLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLXJlZnVlbGluZy1zdGF0aW9ucy10by1vcGVuLWluLW1hc3NhY2h1c2V0dHMtbmV4dC15ZWFyL9IBgQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ib3N0b24uY29tL2NhcnMvbWFzc2FjaHVzZXR0cy1uZXdzLzIwMTYvMDQvMDgvMi1oeWRyb2dlbi1yZWZ1ZWxpbmctc3RhdGlvbnMtdG8tb3Blbi1pbi1tYXNzYWNodXNldHRzLW5leHQteWVhci8_YW1wPTE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Massachusetts News 2 hydrogen refueling stations to open in Massachusetts next year The two stations are the first step in developing a hydrogen infrastructure in the Bay State that can support hydrogen fuel cell vehicles like the Toyota Mirai. TOYOTA

Vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cell technology have been struggling to make inroads in the New England market. But a recent development by a French energy company promises to open the door to more hydrogen vehicles hitting the road.

On Thursday, Air Liquide announced it has entered long-term lease agreements for hydrogen stations in the Massachusetts communities of Braintree and Mansfield. The stations are scheduled to open to the public in early 2017.

Two more hydrogen stations are also planned for Hartford, Connecticut and the Bronx in New York City.

The stations are the first of 12 hydrogen stations Air Liquide plans to open in the northeast region of the U.S. The company has partnered with Toyota Motors in an effort to promote Toyota’s hydrogen-powered Mirai.

One hydrogen fueling station currently exists in Billericaat the headquarters of hydrogen fuel cell maker Nuvera, but it is primarily used to fuel the company’s industrial vehicles.

Hydrogen in New England

One of the key reasons hydrogen-powered cars have not taken off in the region is because there are no refueling stations operational nearby. Charles Myers, president of the Massachusetts Hydrogen Coalition, sees the announcement as key to growing the hydrogen fuel cell market.

“We’re very excited,’’ Myers told Boston.com in a phone interview. “The announcement by Air Liquide confirms the start of a Northeast hydrogen station network that will enable the launch of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in the [region].’’

A spokesperson for Air Liquide said the Braintree and Mansfield sites were chosen after the company “identified key strategic partnerships, both public and private entities, that have the necessary real estate and a large number of sites that would allow for us to expand our infrastructure rapidly.’’

Of the eight remaining stations planned for the Northeast, the Air Liquide spokesman confirmed two more sites are planned for Massachusetts.

The technology

The fuel cell technology combines hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity. Vehicles equipped with the technology only emit water vapors instead of more harmful carbon emissions.

The technology also offers consumers several potential advantages over battery-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. First, while battery-electric and plug-in hybrids can take between 30 minutes and several hours to recharge, it only takes about five minutes to refuel a hydrogen-powered car, similar to refilling a gasoline tank.

Hydrogen-powered vehicles also offer a more impressive range than their electric counterparts. While the recently unveiled Tesla Model 3 boasts a range of 215 miles, the Mirai offers a range of 312 miles. Another hydrogen-powered car, the Hyundai Tucson Fuel Cell, offers a range of 265 miles.

In addition to Toyota and Hyundai, BMW is also planning to add a hydrogen-powered vehicle to its lineup.

In a statement, Air Liquide says its hydrogen will be produced off-site and delivered to the stations. The company says the stations will be able to support other manufacturers as they produce more hydrogen vehicles.

“Air Liquide firmly believes in the potential of hydrogen as a clean and reliable source of energy for the transportation sector, both in the United States and worldwide,’’ said Air Liquide CEO Ole Hoeflemann in a statement.

Update: The headline of this story has been changed and a sentence has been added to reflect the fact that one hydrogen fueling station already exists in Billerica, though it is only accessible to the public in some circumstances."
"Warren Buffett Faces Pressure to Invest for the Climate, Not Just for Profit - InsideClimate News","Tue, 26 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL2luc2lkZWNsaW1hdGVuZXdzLm9yZy9uZXdzLzI2MDQyMDE2L3dhcnJlbi1idWZmZXR0LWJlcmtzaGlyZS1oYXRoYXdheS1jbGltYXRlLWNoYW5nZS1yZW5ld2FibGUtZW5lcmd5LXNvbGFyLWZvc3NpbC1mdWVscy1jb2FsLWJuc2Yv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thousands of bankers, investors, business journalists and just plain fans will flock to Omaha, Neb., on Saturday in a yearly pilgrimage to glean insight from the world’s most famous investor: Warren Buffett.

What they are unlikely to get is any guiding wisdom on climate change, even though the world’s most famous climate scientist, James Hansen, will be among the attendees pushing for it.

The occasion is the annual shareholder meeting of Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett’s vast holding company, where the chief executive will hold court for up to five hours in the 18,000-seat CenturyLink Center, his answers parsed for even the slightest nuance that might signal how others should invest.

Hansen, the former NASA scientist who sounded the alarm on global warming decades ago with congressional testimony, will be there to urge Berkshire Hathaway’s shareholders to support a resolution requiring the company to disclose climate risks facing its insurance business. Outside the arena, a coalition of activists will be chanting and waving signs, encouraging Buffett to take a bold stand on climate change.

The protest and the resolution, introduced by a Nebraska-based nonprofit, seek to highlight Buffett’s conflicting messages on climate change. While he accepts that global warming is real, significant and human-driven, he seems to make investments without considering it. He opposes the shareholder resolution to disclose climate risks and has opposed previous efforts to establish greenhouse gas-reduction targets. And Buffett’s investments support both renewable energy and fossil fuels.

As one of the world’s most powerful investors, whose decisions move markets—Berkshire Hathaway’s $552 billion in assets last year equals the gross domestic product of Poland—Buffett has the opportunity to change the business world’s approach to climate.

“If Mr. Buffett were to decide that fossil fuel-based investments were no longer worth his time or money and focused on renewable energy or other low-carbon investments, that would be a huge shock to the markets,” said Max Messervy, manager of the insurance program at Ceres, a nonprofit that promotes sustainable business practices. “The markets pay attention to where he puts his money.”

Climate Chameleon

Though Buffett profits handsomely from substantial fossil fuel holdings, he has escaped the vilification aimed at other economic giants, like Charles and David Koch. While the Koch Brothers have actively worked to undercut climate science, environmental regulations and clean energy development, Buffett has not pushed for any particular political agenda on energy issues. Nor has he been accused of misleading investors or the public on global warming science or risks, claims lodged against ExxonMobil, coal giant Peabody Energy and other fossil fuel corporations.

The 85-year-old Buffett is a long-time Democrat who has supported liberal causes such as higher taxes on the wealthy, and he’s drawn praise from environmental groups for investing billions of Berkshire Hathaway dollars in wind- and solar-generating plants. His company’s electric utilities own a massive 7 percent of the nation’s wind generation capacity and 6 percent of its solar. This month, Berkshire-owned MidAmerican Energy announced a plan to spend $3.6 billion through 2019 on wind energy, a big step toward the company’s goal of delivering 100 percent clean energy in Iowa.

Yet at the same time, other Berkshire utilities have led fights to block rooftop solar development in Nevada and Utah and invested hundreds of millions to extend the life of coal-fired power plants, locking in carbon emissions for another generation. Through its holdings, Berkshire Hathaway also has about $6.7 billion invested in fossil fuel companies, including the oil refiner Phillips 66 and the Canadian tar sands operator Suncor Energy, Inc. His company’s rail giant, BNSF, drew $4.6 billion in revenue from hauling coal last year.

“The Buffett utility empire is a fractured one,” said Bill Corcoran, western director for the Sierra Club. “It is really a creature running in a lot of different directions, and therefore obscures a clear narrative of what Warren Buffett thinks and wants his companies to do in addressing climate change and building out renewable energy.”

Berkshire Hathaway’s “all-of-the-above” approach to energy is hardly a mystery for analysts, who say Buffett’s business decisions are based purely on their potential to generate returns for his investors. Wind farms, for example, “don’t make sense without the tax credit,” Buffett told Fortune in 2014, referring to a federal production tax credit currently worth 2.3 cents per kilowatt hour produced. Berkshire’s annual report notes that it derives “significant” tax benefits from wind generation.

“He’s the quintessential value investor,” Messervy said. “If he thinks some asset is undervalued by the market, he’s going to invest in it.”

Berkshire Hathaway did not respond to requests for comment for this article, but in February Buffett addressed the climate risk resolution in a letter to shareholders. “It seems highly likely to me that climate change poses a major problem for the planet,” Buffett wrote, but not a problem for profits. He closed by saying: “As a citizen, you may understandably find climate change keeping you up nights. As a homeowner in a low-lying area, you may wish to consider moving. But when you are thinking only as a shareholder of a major insurer, climate change should not be on your list of worries.”

Activist shareholders have sponsored resolutions at least three times since 2011 asking Berkshire Hathaway to set emissions-reductions goals, according to Ceres. Each time Buffett has opposed them, and they have never received more than 10.1 percent of the vote.

An Energy Giant

Berkshire Hathaway’s 62 subsidiaries reach into nearly every major sector of the economy. The company also holds minority stakes in almost four dozen other companies, including giants Kraft Heinz, Coca Cola, AT&T and Walmart. In some states, your whole day could be touched by his companies: from waking up in your Clayton Homes-built bedroom, pulling on Fruit of the Loom sweatpants and sitting down to read a Berkshire-owned newspaper. MidAmerican-generated electricity could be brewing your coffee. The gas fueling your stove could have been carried through a pipeline of Kinder Morgan, in which Berkshire holds a minority position worth about $500 million. Your car or home might be insured by GEICO or another Berkshire-owned insurance business.

One-tenth of American homes could be fueled by the amount of coal hauled by BNSF, which Berkshire bought in 2010. The railroad derived 22 percent of its revenue from coal last year. And while its corporate sustainability report touts the company’s stewardship, including efforts to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, it makes no reference to the impact of burning all that coal.

Berkshire also holds several oil and gas companies, including its recent acquisition of the oil-field chemicals and drilling fluids businesses of Weatherford International. Over the last couple of years, Buffett increased its stake in Phillips 66 to about $5.3 billion, and in Suncor to about $850 million.

Berkshire Hathaway Energy includes four U.S. utilities serving 4.7 million customers and two interstate natural gas pipeline companies, as well as distribution and transmission companies in Great Britain and Canada. In July, the division’s chief joined a dozen other major corporations at the White House as part of the American Businesses Act on Climate Pledge. The company, which said it had already spent some $15 billion on renewable energy, committed to invest “up to an additional $15 billion.” It also said that by 2019, it would retire more than 75 percent its coal generation in Nevada. Berkshire Hathaway Energy currently owns or purchases more than 5,500 megawatts of wind power, the second most of any U.S. utility, according to the American Wind Energy Association.

All of this has won it praise from some environmental groups. But at the same time, two of its utilities have been the subject of activists’ ire for their continued reliance on coal and fierce opposition to rooftop solar. Small-scale solar generation presents a threat to utilities because it reduces the need for new, large power plants, the construction of which is the easiest way for the companies to boost profits.

In December, after a sustained lobbying campaign by Berkshire-owned NV Energy, the Nevada Public Utilities Commission dealt a heavy blow to rooftop solar there by approving a steep hike in fees to be phased in over 12 years that will apply not just to new installations, but also to anyone who already has solar panels. About 17,000 homes and small businesses had installed solar panels in Nevada, but the new rates halted that momentum. SolarCity, a leading installation company, quickly said it would cease its Nevada operations and eliminate 550 jobs.

“There are several key approaches we need utilities to enable and take to address climate change, and that includes a certain amount of rooftop solar,” said Corcoran, of the Sierra Club. “I think however that the far bigger problem for the climate is the continued insistence by PacifiCorp to continue running its coal plants.”

Berkshire-owned PacifiCorp operates across six states, and Corcoran said it’s the biggest coal generator in the West. The company has spent hundreds of millions to maintain its coal plants for decades to come rather than invest in renewables, he said. In December 2012, for example, Oregon’s utility commission penalized the company $17 million for choosing to retrofit old coal plants with pollution controls without studying alternative options.

In March, Buffett addressed the Nevada fight, telling CNBC that his company is not opposed to net-metering, the incentives Nevada and other states have used to encourage rooftop solar, but that the state’s previous fee structure was costing most customers money by forcing NV Energy to buy solar at higher rates than it could produce on its own.

Christine Tezak, managing director at ClearView Energy Partners, LLC, a consulting firm that advises institutional investors and corporate strategists, said she thinks environmental groups’ critiques of Berkshire are misguided. “The thing that strikes me as a bit ironic, if you will, is that the strategy that the Buffett-owned utilities are following is absolutely consistent with the strategy laid out in the Clean Power Plan of the Obama administration.” She said utilities with large coal assets are in the midst of shifting to cleaner fuels, pointing to MidAmerican’s recent announcement as an example, and that they have a responsibility and regulatory obligation to do that while holding down costs.

Without a federal tax credit, it’s unlikely Berkshire’s utilities would be investing substantial sums in renewable energy. In the 2014 Fortune interview, Buffett said the tax credits were “the only reason to build” wind farms. MidAmerican’s proposed wind investment of $3.6 billion announced this month, for example, would bring in credits of the same value over 10 years, the company said.

Corcoran and others say that while they welcome MidAmerican’s renewable energy investments, the other utilities’ actions are undermining a more rapid shift to clean energy.

“So long as Berkshire Hathaway Energy has such an inconsistent approach to clean energy,” Corcoran said, “it is impossible with integrity for Warren Buffett to project an image of clear and timely action on climate change.”

‘I Was Really Angry’

While Berkshire Hathaway’s most direct impacts on climate change may be through its utilities, activists have turned their attention to the company’s insurance business. Insurance companies have the potential to play a powerful role in shifting the economy to be more climate-friendly. Not only are they society’s risk managers, but they also can influence markets by how they invest large amounts of capital.

In acknowledgement of this role, Ajit Jain, who heads the company’s reinsurance group, in 2014 signed on to a “Climate Risk Statement” of the Geneva Association, an insurance industry think tank in Switzerland. The statement lays out a host of ways the industry can help evaluate and mitigate the risks posed by climate change. And when the Bank of England issued a report last September warning of the risks posed to the insurance sector, a small Nebraska nonprofit saw an opportunity.

The Nebraska Peace Foundation had scrounged together $180,000 to buy one Class A share of Berkshire Hathaway stock in 2014 so they could introduce a resolution. “There’s not a whole lot you can do in Nebraska, but we have the ‘Oracle of Omaha,’” said Tim Rinne, the state coordinator for Nebraskans for Peace, a social justice organization that controls the foundation. Rinne’s group modeled its shareholder resolution on the Bank of England report, asking Berkshire Hathaway’s insurance division to report on the risks posed by climate change and what the company is doing to address them.

In February, Buffett issued his response in a letter to shareholders, invoking what he called “Noah’s Law: If an ark may be essential for survival, begin building it today, no matter how cloudless the skies appear.” He claimed, however, that climate change has not yet produced the type of catastrophic weather that could pose a threat to his company’s profits.

That he addressed the issue at all was a victory for the group. But the comments were roundly criticized by climate advocates, who noted that climate change has already been linked to more extreme weather, not to mention sea level rise, drought, heat waves and other dangerous impacts.

“I was really angry,” said Jane Kleeb, who runs Bold Nebraska, a citizen advocacy group that focuses on energy and climate. “I couldn’t believe that he said if you live in a low lying area you should probably move, and we understand climate change may keep people up at night, but we’re not going to do anything.”

Kleeb’s group is planning the rally outside the shareholder conference and latched onto his reference to Noah’s ark as an organizing principle. The group has been gathering signatures on a petition urging shareholders to vote in favor of the resolution that it will present to the company on Saturday.

“He needs to be challenged to take a stronger leadership role on climate change,” she said. Bold Nebraska was among several groups, including the Sierra Club and Greenpeace, that have been pressuring Buffett’s companies in Nevada and other states, but she said the fight so far has taken place far away from his Omaha headquarters. “This is our attempt to make sure he feels that at home as well.”"

Société Générale and Express Union team up to create extended network with over 700 branches in Cameroon - Business in Cameroon,"Sat, 30 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luY2FtZXJvb24uY29tL2ZpbmFuY2UvMzAwNC02MTkwLXNvY2lldGUtZ2VuZXJhbGUtYW5kLWV4cHJlc3MtdW5pb24tdGVhbS11cC10by1jcmVhdGUtZXh0ZW5kZWQtbmV0d29yay13aXRoLW92ZXItNzAwLWJyYW5jaGVzLWluLWNhbWVyb29u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Business in Cameroon) - The Cameroonian subsidiary of the French banking group Société Générale (SG) and the money transfer company Express Union have just signed a partnership, which will enable them to set up the biggest financial services network of the country, with close to 700 branches, we officially learned.

In effect, the two partners explain, the 680 branches of the leader in domestic money transfers in the country, as well as the 32 banking agencies of the Société Générale Cameroun network will now become ""contact points"" for the clients of both operators.

In practical terms, we learn, this vast network will be used to make cash deposits on accounts held at Société Générale Cameroun; as well as withdrawals. Additionally, it will now be possible to transfer money to friends and family directly from SG bank accounts; or withdraw or transfer money by bank card, through the electronic points of sale (EPOS) which will be installed throughout the network of Express Union.

This partnership enables SG Cameroun, market leader for bank loans in the country, to get closer to its client base, but most importantly to further expand its network while avoiding the costs associated to the creation of new branches. The local subsidiary of SG will also be able to win new market shares in the rural areas of Cameroon, which are literally covered by the money transfer Express Union, but where banks are barely present.

For Express Union, who has been experimenting with the microfinance activity for some months, with far less success than in the money transfer sector; the company should be able to benefit from the expertise of Société Générale to gain more experience in this activity. Furthermore, the leader in the domestic money transfer market, who is also present in other Central and Western African countries, will indirectly strengthen its own treasury by getting access to some of SG's deposits.

This figure was revealed last week during a site visit by the Minister of Agriculture, Henri Eyebe Ayissi.

In spite of this forecast, the management of this para-public company decried the severity of the drought this year especially in the northern part of the country. However, thanks to irrigation techniques practised by cotton farmers for many years, this climatic caprice should not affect production much as is expected at Sosucam (the Cameroon Sugar Company), where they fear a decrease of 8% in initial production targets.

It is recalled, that to finance its 2016 campaign, Sodecoton raised in February 2016, an envelope of FCfa 35 billion (extendable to FCfa 40 billion according to the needs of the company) through a consortium of five local banks. As usual, the operation was piloted by the Commercial Bank of Cameroon (CBC). These funds will be used to purchase cotton from 250,000 producers that the company supports in the Extreme North of Cameroon.

Des efforts récompensés par un marché historique, celui passé par Kiloutou pour l’acquisition de 900 chariots télescopiques et industriels tout terrain mais aussi des nacelles automotrices.



Sur un terrain de 33 hectares dont 8 construits, Manitou fabrique en série sa gamme de chariots télescopiques fixes à destination de l’agricole avec les MLT, de la construction et des industries avec les MT.

L’organisation mise en place depuis l’arrivée de Michel Denis porte sur la flexibilité et la productivité des usines. L’idée est de continuer à maîtriser le savoir-faire ""maison"", avec une intégration maximale, de la conception à la fabrication, d’un maximum de composants névralgiques d’un télecopique comme les flèches qui vont de 6 à 18 m de longueur. Ceci à partir d’un chaîne automatisée de soudage mise au point avec Air Liquide, composée de 4 robots de soudure et dimensionnée pour sortir 40 tubes par robot toutes les 8 h. A savoir qu’une flèche de chariot télescopique comprend en moyenne 2,5 tubes.



Mais l’usine de Manitou à Ancenis gère également 28 autres robots de soudure et d’autres postes de soudage manuels pour l’assemblage des sous ensembles des chariots télescopiques, tels que les châssis mécano soudés. Pour la partie assemblage, Manitou utilise deux lignes distinctes, dont la principale de 26 postes, très automatisée, sort jusqu’à 16 modèles par jour. La phase de contrôle final intègre 250 points à vérifier par engins et des essais de comportement sur circuit d’essais sur une plage de 3 à 6 h."
Brevets : Valeo accède au trio de tête des grands déposants - Les Échos,"Tue, 05 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxlc2VjaG9zLmZyLzIwMTYvMDQvYnJldmV0cy12YWxlby1hY2NlZGUtYXUtdHJpby1kZS10ZXRlLWRlcy1ncmFuZHMtZGVwb3NhbnRzLTIyNDU3NdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Par Chantal Houzelle

Immuable pendant trois ans, le trio de tête du palmarès de l'Inpi publié en exclusivité par « Les Echos », et qui comptabilise les demandes de brevets publiées l'an dernier - c'est-à-dire déposées entre le 1erjuillet 2013 et le 30 juin 2014, en raison du délai légal de publication de dix-huit mois -, a enfin bougé en 2015.

Malgré un portefeuille qui décélère avec un compteur arrêté à 1.378 en 2013, 1.063 en 2014 et 1.012 en 2015, PSA Peugeot Citroën garde largement sa pole position dans la course au titre de plus grand déposant de brevets en France (en intégrant sa filiale Faurecia). « Nous avons effectivement recentré notre stratégie de propriété industrielle depuis trois ans, en mettant la priorité sur les inventions qui nourrissent la stratégie d'innovation du groupe sur trois axes », confirme Gilles Le Borgne, directeur de la R&D du groupe. « Nous avons d'abord protégé les inventions qui permettent la réduction des émissions, comme les moteurs Diesel BlueHDI et essence 3 cylindres PureTech ou la technologie hybride électrique, ainsi que les innovations qui rendent nos véhicules autonomes et connectés, telles les aides automatiques à la conduite », précise-t-il. « Sans oublier les technologies différenciantes pour l'identité de nos marques, par exemple les peintures texturées, la signature optique, l'Airbump ou les ambiances lumineuses. » La part des premiers dépôts français du constructeur automobile tourne toujours autour de 90 %, reflétant le maintien de l'essentiel de sa R&D en France. « Notre taux d'extension à l'international est de 35 %, ce qui nous procure une bonne protection mondiale », estime Gilles Le Borgne.

Poursuivant son offensive, Safran, le challenger de PSA, consolide sa 2e position au classement, avec un score de 769 brevets. Entre 2013 et 2015, l'expert tricolore des technologies innovantes pour l'aéronautique et la défense a fortement réduit son écart, de 733 à 243.

Si le trio de tête du palmarès 2015 de l'Inpi est bousculé, c'est sous la montée en puissance de l'équipementier automobile Valeo. Propulsé par un bond de 41 %, à 668 brevets l'an dernier, il remonte de deux places et accède à la 3e marche du podium. « Depuis 2013, nous avons défini une politique de dépôt de brevets qui vise à protéger à la fois les solutions que nous développons, mais également leurs alternatives », explique Béatrice Lévy-Moulin, directrice de la propriété intellectuelle de Valeo. Le taux d'extension des brevets qu'il dépose en France est de l'ordre de 65 %. « La propriété industrielle est aujourd'hui complètement intégrée au processus de développe ment de nos technologies dans les domaines stratégiques pour notre groupe : la réduction des émissions de CO2 et la conduite intuitive », ajoute-t-elle. Détrôné du podium par Valeo pour un écart de 10 brevets, le Commissariat à l'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives (CEA), qui s'était même classé deuxième du palmarès 2012 et soutient une progression continue de son portefeuille de brevets, n'en demeure pas moins un grand innovateur. Pour preuve, le CEA s'est vu classé, mi-mars, comme l'organisme de recherche le plus innovant au monde dans le « Top 25 Global Innovators-Government » établi par Reuters.

Renault rétrograde

Par ricochet, Renault, qui avait fait un retour spectaculaire dans la course en 2013, après sa chute libre du 2e au 10e rang en 2011 pour cause de coupes budgétaires, rétrograde au 5e rang, avec 539 brevets (+10). Alors que le CNRS gagne une place et se classe 6e, avec 19 brevets de moins dans son escarcelle qu'en 2014, soit 390.

En dix ans, la concentration s'est fortement accentuée en France, puisque les vingt premiers du classement représentent plus de 40 % des brevets publiés en 2015, contre 25 % en 2004. « Il est surprenant de voir que les entreprises présentes dans ce palmarès sont les mêmes depuis plusieurs années, mais certaines connaissent encore une progression importante », souligne Yves Lapierre, directeur général de l'Inpi. La plus forte (+72 %) est à mettre à l'actif d'Air Liquide, qui pointe à la 12e place en 2015. Et grâce à une accélération de 38 %, Michelin se glisse dans le Top 10."
Air Liquide To Build New Hydrogen Fuel Stations In The US - Hydrogen News - Green Hydrogen Report,"Mon, 11 Apr 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmh5ZHJvZ2VuZnVlbG5ld3MuY29tL2Fpci1saXF1aWRlLXRvLWJ1aWxkLW5ldy1oeWRyb2dlbi1mdWVsLXN0YXRpb25zLWluLXRoZS11cy84NTI4MzMzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"New hydrogen stations to be built in four new locations

Air Liquide has announced new locations for hydrogen fuel stations in the United States. The company plans to build these fueling stations in the northeastern region of the company, and they will be open to the public. These stations will serve to bolster the regions hydrogen infrastructure, which has been taking form over the past few years. This infrastructure is needed to ensure the successful adoption of fuel cell vehicles, which automakers intend to launch throughout the country in the coming years.

New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts will play host to new fueling stations being built by Air Liquide

The fueling stations will be built in three states: Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York. Air Liquide has entered into long-term lease agreements with the cities that will play host to these fueling stations. The hydrogen that these stations will provide will be supplied by Air Liquide itself, which has played a major role in the development of a hydrogen fuel infrastructure in the United States and elsewhere around the world.

Fuel cell vehicles are becoming more attractive to consumers

Fuel cell vehicles have yet to become widely available in the United States, partly due to their cost and the lack of a hydrogen infrastructure. These vehicles are somewhat popular among consumers, however, due to their efficiency. According to many automakers, their fuel cell vehicles can travel more than 300 miles on a single tank of fuel. These vehicles can be fueled in under five minutes as well, whereas conventional battery electric vehicles take several hours to charge. Cost remains an issue, but many consumers interested in clean transportation have shown they are willing to embrace fuel cell vehicles.

Developing a hydrogen infrastructure has been slow going

Building a hydrogen infrastructure has proven difficult and expensive. Air Liquide, as well as other organizations, have been investing in the development of this infrastructure in order to take advantage of the growing demand for hydrogen. The complications associated with this endeavor, however, have slowed the building on new fueling stations in many parts of the world."
