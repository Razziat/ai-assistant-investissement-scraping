Paris, September 14, 2023 – TotalEnergies and Air Liquide have signed an agreement for the long-term supply of green and low carbon hydrogen to the TotalEnergies refining and petrochemical platform in Normandy. The project will contribute to the decarbonization of the Gonfrevillle site, reducing its CO 2 emissions by up to 150,000 tons a year. This cooperation between Air Liquide and TotalEnergies is aligned with the two companies’ shared commitment to contributing to decarbonize industrial operations in the Axe Seine corridor.

The project calls for the supply of 10,000 tons of green hydrogen per year to the TotalEnergies platform in Normandy and up to 5,000 tons per year of low carbon hydrogen starting from the second half of 2026. It is comprised of two integrated parts:

The production of green and low carbon hydrogen by the Normand’hy electrolyzer, which will be built and operated by Air Liquide, with a total electrical capacity of 200 MW. TotalEnergies will have access to half of this production capacity, corresponding to the amount of hydrogen supplied to its refinery.

TotalEnergies will supply around 700 GWh/year of renewable and low carbon power to the Air Liquide electrolyzer for half of its capacity, i.e. 100 MW, corresponding to the share of hydrogen delivered to the TotalEnergies refinery in Normandy.

""This partnership with Air Liquide is a new step in TotalEnergies' ambition to decarbonize the hydrogen used by its refineries in Europe by 2030.

signature of an agreement with TotalEnergies to supply their Gonfreville refinery with renewable and low-carbon hydrogen.

On the occasion of the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding to supply the TotalEnergies refinery in Gonfreville, Normandy, France, with renewable and low-carbon hydrogen, Air Liquide announces an investment of over 400 million euros for the construction of its Normand’Hy electrolyzer, with a capacity of 200 MW. The cooperation between Air Liquide and TotalEnergies is part of the development of a renewable and low-carbon hydrogen sector on the Axe Seine, to contribute to decarbonizing industry in the Normandy region.

As part of this agreement, the Air Liquide Normand’Hy electrolyzer will deliver to TotalEnergies’ refinery in Gonfreville, over the long term, from the second half of 2026, renewable and low-carbon hydrogen equivalent to an electrolysis capacity of 100 MW. The remaining 100 MW will be dedicated to customers in the Normandy industrial basin, as well as for the development of low-carbon mobility.

To supply Air Liquide Normand’Hy, TotalEnergies will generate up to 100 MW renewable electricity to power the electrolyzer, volume corresponding to the hydrogen delivered to its refinery. For the remainder of the electrolyzer’s electricity needs, Air Liquide plans to sign long-term renewable Power Purchase Agreements (PPA), completed with low-carbon energy from the French power grid.

Air Liquide Normand'Hy is the largest PEM electrolyzer ever built. Based on Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolysis technology, it will integrate equipment produced in the framework of the joint venture between Air Liquide and Siemens Energy. Avoiding up to 250,000 tons of CO2 emissions per year, it will be located in the Port-Jérôme industrial zone in Normandy, France, and will be part of Air Liquide’s local hydrogen network[1].

Air Liquide Normand'Hy will represent an investment of over 400 million euros for the Group. Within the framework of the Important Project of Common European Interest (PIIEC) approved by the European Commission, the project has received the support of the French government for an amount of 190 million euros, as part of the ""Plan de Relance"".

The French oil giant yesterday announced that it would supply 100MW of renewable and “low-carbon” power to the Normand’Hy electrolysers, and consequently offtake 10,000 tonnes of green H 2 and 5,000 of “low-carbon” hydrogen a year from the second half of 2026.

The project will be one of the first to be supplied from Siemens Energy’s new electrolyser factory in Berlin, which will begin serial production of electrolyser stacks in November, and be expanded to at least 3GW of annual capacity by 2025.

This plant is 25.1%-owned by the French industrial gases company, as part of a joint venture with the German energy giant that was announced in June 2022.

Siemens says that Normand’Hy, in the commune of Port-Jérôme, will produce 28,000 tonnes of “sustainable hydrogen” annually for industry and the mobility sector.

Offtakers for the remainder of the hydrogen — which could be green if supplied by renewable energy — has not been revealed. However, in March 2022, Air Liquide said Normand’Hy would “also contribute to the development of heavy-duty hydrogen mobility” in Normandy.

Also in March 2022, the French government set aside €190m of financial support for the Normand’Hy project, which will be released if the European Commission deems it to be an Important Project of Common Interest and therefore eligible for state aid. But this designation does not seem to have been assigned yet.

“The sustainable decarbonisation of industry is unthinkable without green hydrogen,” said Anne-Laure de Chammard, a management board member at Siemens Energy.

“That's why projects like this are so important. However, this can only be a starting point for a sustainable transformation of the industrial landscape. Further major projects must follow quickly.

“In order for the development of a European hydrogen economy to succeed, we need reliable political support and simplified procedures for promoting and approving such projects.”"

World's first crewed liquid hydrogen plane takes off - TNW,"Fri, 08 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlbmV4dHdlYi5jb20vbmV3cy93b3JsZC1maXJzdC1waWxvdGVkLWxpcXVpZC1oeWRyb2dlbi1wbGFuZS10YWtlcy1vZmbSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"At a somewhat small and unassuming airport in Maribor, Slovenia, German hydrogen propulsion startup H2FLY has quietly been building up to a major milestone in zero-emission aviation over the summer. And all the hard work has come to fruition, with the successful completion of the world’s first crewed liquid hydrogen-powered flights.

Before any aviation history enthusiast out there goes “but what about the Tupolev Tu-155?” — yes, the Soviets did try out liquid hydrogen as fuel 35 years ago, but only for one of the three engines. In contrast, H2FLY’s HY4 has now operated using only liquid hydrogen (as opposed to the gaseous kind) as fuel, relying solely on the hydrogen fuel-cell powertrain for the entire flight.

On Thursday, this TNW reporter was present for the fourth in a series of test flights. The event marked the culmination of Project HEAVEN, an EU-funded partnership undertaking to demonstrate the feasibility of using liquid, cryogenic hydrogen in aircraft. (That is short for High powEr density FC System for Aerial Passenger VEhicle fueled by liquid HydrogeN, just FYI.)

Liquid vs. gaseous hydrogen as aircraft fuel

While yesterday’s demonstration flight lasted somewhere around the 10-minute mark, a few days prior, the HY4 and its two pilots stayed in the air for 3 hours and 1 minute — a feat that required 10kg of hydrogen. If using up the aircraft’s full storage capacity of 24kg, it could stay up for 8 hours.

“It feels really amazing, it is the perfect teamwork coming to life,” said one of the pilots, Johannes Garbino-Anton, after the flight. He added that the technology “works perfectly,” and that the biggest difference to a normal aircraft is the lack of vibrations and noise. And, the lack of carbon dioxide emissions.

The mood was distinctly jubilant following the series of four successful test flights. Credit: Linnea Ahlgren/TNW

H2FLY’s propulsion system consists of hydrogen storage, a 120kW fuel-cell energy converter, and an electrical engine. All in all, this summer was H2FLY’s eight flight test campaign. The hydrogen-electric HY4 has been flying since 2016, but this summer’s breakthrough consists of operating the plane on liquid hydrogen, as opposed to hydrogen as gas.

Liquid hydrogen is more energy dense than its gaseous counterpart. That means that it requires significantly lower tank weights and volume. In the world of air transport, especially when retrofitting planes, this equals not having to throw out as many passenger seats, or reduce cargo space, i.e. payload.

But perhaps more significantly, it unlocks a much greater range. For the HY4 test aircraft, this equals 750km on gaseous hydrogen vs. 1,500km on liquid — or double the distance. On the other hand, liquid hydrogen requires cryogenic temperatures (around -253°C), which adds to the complexity of transporting and refuelling.

Retrofitting existing airframes with hydrogen fuel-cell propulsion system

The HY4, made out of glass fibre and carbon fibre, will not go into commercial production. The next step from H2FLY will now be to scale the fuel-cell system to megawatt capacity. The H2F-175 system will unlock not only longer range, but also altitudes of up to 27,000 feet. In a partnership with Deutsche Aircraft, the two intend to retrofit a 30-seat Dornier 328 demonstrator with H2FLY hydrogen-electric fuel cells and begin test flights by 2025.

The company’s timeline is slightly more restrained than some of its competitors, but H2FLY co-founder and CEO, Dr Josef Kallo, says he foresees that an upscaled system will be capable of powering a 40-seat capacity regional plane with a range of about 2,000km by the end of the decade.

“As an engineer, I can say that a 40-seater hydrogen-powered plane is a question of money and time. After that it becomes visionary,” Kallo stated.

However, he also added that the tests thus far indicate that it would be possible to scale up to 4MW + 4MW powertrains, which could propel larger aircraft for 80 to 100 passengers. He also does not exclude entirely new aircraft designs from new manufacturers, including for instance a blended wing body.

Liquid hydrogen potential ‘gamechanger’ for commercial aviation

Something else a future of clean-burning, hydrogen-powered aviation requires is — other than the actual fuel — is refuelling infrastructure. For Project HEAVEN, H2FLY has been working with Air Liquide.

For the French industrial gas supplier, which is betting heavily on green hydrogen as part of the future energy mix, it is also about demonstrating viability and shoring up industry demand. “This is the very first time we have brought liquid hydrogen to be refuelled at a commercial airport,” said Pierre Crespi, Innovation Director at Air Liquide Advanced Technologies.

The hydrogen itself arrived in Maribor by truck, following rigorous safety requirements from the Slovenian authorities.

“I cannot stress the importance of achievement in terms of the technology itself,” said Marco Rizzatto, flight test engineer at Pipistrel Vertical Solutions, who supported the integration of the cryogenic fuel tank. “Liquid hydrogen has the potential to be a gamechanger for commercial aviation.”

H2FLY was founded in 2015 by five engineers from the German Aerospace Center in Stuttgart and the University of Ulm. The company works on the propulsion system as a whole, but also develops the individual components when it is necessary. In 2021, H2FLY was acquired by Joby Aviation, a California-based company developing an electrical vertical take-off and landing vehicle (eVTOL) to operate air taxi services."

TotalEnergies signs green hydrogen deal to supply Normandy refinery - Windpower Monthly,"Wed, 27 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpbmRwb3dlcm1vbnRobHkuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMTgzODg1MS90b3RhbGVuZXJnaWVzLXNpZ25zLWdyZWVuLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLWRlYWwtc3VwcGx5LW5vcm1hbmR5LXJlZmluZXJ50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TotalEnergies has signed an agreement with Air Liquide for the supply of green hydrogen to its Gonfreville refining and petrochemical platform in Normandy, under a shared commitment to decarbonise industrial operations in Axe Seine.

The project calls for the supply of 15,000t/y of green hydrogen to the TotalEnergies platform, starting with up to 5,000t/y from the second half of 2026.

The cooperation revolves around two linked parts. Air Liquide will build and operate the so-called Normand’hy electrolyser, with a total electrical capacity of 200 MW. TotalEnergies will supply around 700 GWh/year of wind and solar energy to power its share (100MW) of the electrolyser, corresponding to the share of hydrogen delivered to its refinery.

Meanwhile, TotalEnergies is launching a call for tenders for the supply of 500,000t/y of green hydrogen by 2030 to replace the current hydrogen supply at six refineries and two biorefineries in Europe.

“By offering to various worldwide suppliers the opportunity to secure medium- and long-term contracts with TotalEnergies, we trust we will benefit from the most competitive solutions they have developed,” said Patrick Pouyanné, chief executive of TotalEnergies.

TotalEnergies aims to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions directly linked to its oil and gas operations by 40% by 2030, compared with 2015 levels.

Hydrogen Stocks: Massive Opportunity in Europe - Value the Markets,"Tue, 19 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbHVldGhlbWFya2V0cy5jb20vYW5hbHlzaXMvZXVyb3BlYW4taHlkcm9nZW4td2hvLXdpbGwtYmUtdG9wLW9mLXRoZS1waWxl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Developing renewable hydrogen is one of the European Union’s key priorities for decarbonizing the continent. But 96% of the hydrogen used in Europe’s energy consumption was produced with natural gas, resulting in significant CO2 emissions. Government investment is likely on the way, giving the right companies a serious growth opportunity. This article analyses the subject with reference to Air Liquide SA ( OTC: AIQUY ), Linde PLC ( NYSE: LIN ), Siemens AG ( OTC: SIEGY ) and Jericho Energy Ventures ( TSX.V: JEV ) ( OTC: JROOF ).

One example that underscores the opportunity stems from the European Commission’s Green Deal Industrial Plan. This document outlined plans to launch an auction for supporting renewable hydrogen production. Winners are set to receive a fixed premium for each kg of renewable hydrogen produced over 10 years.

The different businesses discussed in this article are making a variety of moves to capitalize on the hydrogen opportunity. These range from investing in hydrogen production plants or methods of green hydrogen generation, all the way through to innovative hydrogen technologies that will allow different sectors to decarbonize their operations.

Jericho Energy Ventures ( TSX.V: JEV ) ( OTC: JROOF ) has developed a wide range of green hydrogen technologies. Primary among these is its patented zero-emission DCC™ hydrogen-fueled steam boiler, which targets the underserved industrial and commercial markets.

Through this cutting-edge innovation, the company has gained exposure to the growing hydrogen opportunity in Europe. That’s because its EU partner, Exogen, is offering a first-of-its-kind Hydrogen Steam Plant, featuring the state-of-the-art boiler technology.

In more good news for Jericho, Exogen has bagged a memorandum of understanding with leading European green hydrogen producer Lhyfe. The duo will work together on the joint operation of industrial steam plants and mobility solutions powered by green hydrogen. This move could open large new markets for industrial steam and district heating growth, potentially greatly benefitting this small-cap.

This potential might be why some analysts are already branding this stock a BUY!

Air Liquide SA ( OTC: AIQUY ) produces, markets, and sells industrial and healthcare gases, including liquid nitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide, and oxygen. The company also produces welding, diving, and technical-medical equipment.

The French industrial gases specialist has made energy transition and hydrogen infrastructure construction key targets for the future. As part of these goals, the company is embracing hydrogen energy.

One example of this was announced in June when it agreed to a wind power purchase agreement with green energy giant Statkraft. This agreement will result in renewable energy being used to power the French giant’s new electrolyser plant in Oberhausen, Germany, to produce renewable hydrogen at an industrial scale.

Some of the planned infrastructure is incredibly ambitious, including the mooted creation of a hydrogen airport. This project has seen the company team up with Groupe ADP, with the duo facilitating the introduction of hydrogen planes in approximately 30 airports around the world.

Linde PLC ( NYSE: LIN ) is an industrial gas and engineering company that offers industrial gases, technologies, and gas processing solutions.

The German company has made major commitments to exploiting the clean energy opportunity in Europe, stating in February that it will invest as much as $9bn in green technology over the next three years.

The business has been backing up this ambition too. After finishing Greece’s first-ever green hydrogen electrolysis plant, regional CEO Oana Reiber said the company wanted to “achieve decarbonisation in all sectors of industry and automotive”.

It has achieved some world firsts beyond production too, as the business looks for other areas that are ripe for hydrogen innovation. For example, this year has seen the business announce its development of the first-ever hydrogen ferry.

The MF Hydra started commercial operations in March with a fuel containment system built, developed and installed by the chemicals giant.

Siemens AG ( OTC: SIEGY ) is a German engineering and manufacturing company, focusing on areas such as electrification, automation, and digitalization. It also provides engineering solutions in automation and control, power, transportation, and medical diagnosis.

The business has notably been turning its attention towards hydrogen power.

Last year, the company announced plans for one of the largest green hydrogen generation plants in Germany. The announcement stated the plant will use wind and solar power to produce green hydrogen through an 8.75-megawatt electrolyzer. The project, which will serve the industrial, commercial and road transport markets, is expected to produce 1,350 tons of hydrogen every year.

Beyond this, the company has also joined forces with the already referenced Air Liquide to produce industrial-scale renewable hydrogen electrolyzers. A statement from the company said the hope of the project is to foster a European ecosystem for electrolysis and hydrogen technology.

The hydrogen opportunity in Europe is huge and companies are scrambling to find the best way to contribute. Some, like Siemens and Air Liquide, seem focused on the generation of hydrogen and green hydrogen. Others, such as Jericho, have developed exciting technology that provides hard-to-abate sectors with a way to use the influx of newly available green hydrogen to decarbonize their operations. Then there are the likes of Linde, which are attempting to juggle both approaches."

"Furious motorist throws eco protester to the side of the road, punches and kicks another before slapping a thi - Daily Mail","Fri, 08 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTEyNDk2MTQ3L1N0cmVldHMtcmFnZS1GdXJpb3VzLW1vdG9yaXN0LXRocm93cy1lY28tcHJvdGVzdGVyLXJvYWQtcHVuY2hlcy1raWNrcy1zbGFwcGluZy1ncm91cC1zdGFnZXMtc2l0LXByb3Rlc3QtR2VybWFuLWhpZ2h3YXkuaHRtbNIBsQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTEyNDk2MTQ3L2FtcC9TdHJlZXRzLXJhZ2UtRnVyaW91cy1tb3RvcmlzdC10aHJvd3MtZWNvLXByb3Rlc3Rlci1yb2FkLXB1bmNoZXMta2lja3Mtc2xhcHBpbmctZ3JvdXAtc3RhZ2VzLXNpdC1wcm90ZXN0LUdlcm1hbi1oaWdod2F5Lmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This is the moment a fed up motorist resorted to violence to break up a street-blocking eco-protest in Germany.

Shocking video shows the enraged man leaping into the B36 highway near the Victoria Tower in Mannheim and began punching and kicking a series of activists from Last Generation - a German climate protection movement.

Police have now arrested the 29-year-old suspect, according to German newspaper Bild.de.

The assailant, wearing a white vest and grey jogging bottoms, was one of several angered motorists who confronted the eco-zealots who had donned orange uniforms and sat on the tarmac, backing up three lanes of cars.

When the demonstrators remained seated and refused to move he snapped, lashing out with fists and feet of fury and dragging them away.

Mannheim Police found out about the attack the following day and arrested the suspect in Ludwigsburg, where he was taken for interrogation.

The infuriated motorist grabs the protester's hair before hitting him in the face

The man is seen yanking the protester out of the road as other annoyed motorists look on

He returns to kick and slap another member of the group

He is now facing charges of assault, according to Bild.de.

But Aimée van Baalen, the group's spokeswoman, remains steadfast in their commitment to continue similar protests despite the controversy.

She maintains that Last Generation will not be deterred by opposition and is resolute in its mission to bring attention to climate change.

'The federal government ignored our protest for so long that scenes like yesterday in Mannheim have now occurred - this saddens and shocks us,' she said, blaming the authorities for the continuation of the protests.

It comes just days after a disgruntled police officer poured vegetable oil over the head of one protester who blocked a bridge.

An image shared by German outlet Rheinpfalz showed the police officer holding a huge canister of oil and tipping it down the neck of the orange-clad protester on the Konrad Adenauer Bridge between Mannheim and Ludwigshafen on Saturday.

Mannheim police confirmed to German media they were investigating the matter but refused to offer a comment on the actions of the officer.

Last Generation has earned a reputation for its road-based protests which often see demonstrators glue themselves to the asphalt in actions similar to those of Extinction Rebellion and Just Stop Oil in the UK.

The group staged 276 road blockages in Germany alone throughout 2022.

The latest incidents in Mannheim come weeks after one Last Generation protester was hit by a lorry of a low-carbon energy company.

In July, three protesters were dragged out of the way by a furious lorry driver working for low-carbon energy company Air Liquide - only to rush back in front of the lorry before one of them was knocked flying.

Air Liquide is the Paris Olympics' official hydrogen supporter and works to innovate 'the development of low-carbon hydrogen and biomethane for the energy transition'.

The driver is pictured trying to drag the protestor sitting in the road out from under the lorry

The lorry ploughed through the protestors, knocking one back before the driver stopped

The footage showed the driver pushing one of the protestors after they obstructed the road

The driver of the lorry at first jumps out to push and drag the activists out of his way.

When they sit back in position, he slowly starts driving forward - and then shunts the activist closest to the pavement. The force is enough to send the young man flying back and bystanders come to his aid.

The lorry driver is seen throwing his hands up in frustration and stops the lorry before leaping out of the cab again to pull the protesters aside.

Air Liquide provided the following statement to MailOnline: 'On July 12, Air Liquide was made aware of an altercation in Stralsund, Germany, between a third-party contract driver of Air Liquide Medical Gases and local protesters.

'Images display unacceptable behaviour from the driver that is not aligned with Air Liquide's values in any way.

'The third-party contractor has been notified that Air Liquide will no longer accept the services of this individual.'"

Changing the face of O2 supply - Australian Mining,"Wed, 06 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5taW5pbmcuY29tLmF1L2NoYW5naW5nLXRoZS1mYWNlLW9mLW8yLXN1cHBseS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide has been in business since 1902 and is dedicated to providing a seamless customer experience.

Air Liquide is continuing to develop its oxygen technology to make mining easier and smoother for its customers.

Having been in the business since 1902, Air Liquide knows a thing or two about how the mining sector can benefit from oxygen.

The company is constantly redefining and developing its technologies to help ensure the Australian mining industry can continue to produce the quantity and quality of ore for which it is so widely known.

One of these technologies is Pressure Swing Absorption, or PSA, which can produce oxygen on-site.

“We have ridden the waves of PSA development for over 30 years,” national and key account manager – mining and extraction Rick Edwards told Australian Mining.

“The last decade saw a strong shift towards bulk liquid supply, but the tide is beginning to turn and PSAs are again being favoured by the industry.

“This is flagshipped by Air Liquide recently commissioning our first PSA in Western Australia in more than 10 years.”

PSA technology is a leading form of on-site oxygen production for medium to high oxygen consumers operating in the 10–30tpd (tonnes of O2 per day) range. It has always been a popular supply mode for gold mine applications due to their remote proximity and the typical oxygen consumption profiles.

Edwards called the installation a significant milestone for Air Liquide.

“We have revolutionised the PSA solution with a number of key design aspects to significantly increase the reliability and safety of the plant,” he said.

“The plant was designed by local experts and assembled in our WA facility in Henderson.

“The unique design has drawn many eyes from within Air Liquide’s global network and the success of the commissioning signals a revival of the supply mode. We now have a proven solution we can offer with confidence to existing and new customers.”

PSAs have long been the traditional go-to oxygen supply application for most mine sites.

However, the first generation of PSAs had been steadily wearing down due to the usually hot climate of the Australian mine.

“These issues were compounded by an increase in bulk liquid availability and bulk delivery efficiencies,” Edwards said.

“With the low capital cost for the customer and ample supply pressure, the bulk solution became more reliable and cost-effective.

“These changes prompted Air Liquide to revisit PSA technology, but we did so with a revitalised approach.

“The primary objective was to develop a standardised plant that is capable of delivering the typical supply pressure required by our customers while avoiding an oxygen booster, something we are proud to say we have successfully achieved.”

Air Liquide can also offer over-the-fence (OTF) or build-own-operate (BOO) packages to suit a customer’s needs.

“With these packages, Air Liquide takes everything in hand, including installation, operation and maintenance, telemonitored performance tracking and full back-up,” Edwards said.

“An OTF or BOO model is the only way to encase a full oxygen supply solution with guaranteed performance. A supply agreement between both parties ensures the plant meets the agreed flow rate, pressure, purity and ongoing availability.

“Any shortfall in purity or flow rate or any unplanned downtime is addressed by the supplier’s liquid back-up system with no impact to the customer, so the incentive is on us to ensure a reliable system.”

While the revolutionised PSA solution provides an answer to the medium oxygen consumer, Air Liquide is also revolutionising solutions for large consumers, and this is evident with the introduction of its new-generation APSA technology

“The APSA O2 is the latest in low-carbon technology, capable of delivering large volumes of oxygen with high energy efficiency,” Edwards said.

“The APSA uses cryogenic distillation to deliver a higher purity at a reduced energy consumption. It brings the benefits of cryogenic distillation to a market segment that has previously had no alternative to multiple VSAs (vacuum swing adsorption). This is very exciting, as we can now offer the most efficient solution available on the market to high gaseous oxygen consumers.”

Powered by a cellcentric fuel-cell system and equipped with a liquid hydrogen fuel tank system, the run started Monday 25 September in the afternoon at Mercedes-Benz Truck’s Customer Center in Wörth am Rhein and finished on Tuesday morning 26 September in Germany’s capital city Berlin.

With a GVM of 40 tonnes, the vehicle completed the run fully loaded under real-life conditions, without emitting any CO 2 during the complete run.

The record drive with sealed tanks and controlled mileage was independently confirmed by an inspection document from TÜV Rheinland.

After the successful run, Andreas Gorbach, Member of the Board of Management of Daimler Truck AG, Head of Truck Technology, drove the truck across the finish line in the Ministergarten in Berlin.

“To decarbonise transport, we need both battery-electric and hydrogen-powered drive technologies,” he said.

“The sweet spot for fuel cell trucks lies in flexible and demanding long haul transportation tasks. By cracking the 1,000-kilometre mark with one fill, we have now impressively demonstrated hydrogen in trucks is anything but hot air, and we are making very good progress on the road to series production,” said Gorbach.

“At the same time, our record run today is a reminder that decarbonising transportation requires two other factors in addition to the right drive technologies — a green energy infrastructure and competitive costs compared to conventional vehicles.”

Ahead of the run, the Mercedes-Benz GenH2 Truck was fuelled with liquid hydrogen at Daimler Truck’s filling station at the company’s development and testing centre in Wörth.

The hydrogen was supplied by Air Liquide and is reportedly of renewable origin.

During the refuelling process, cryogenic liquid hydrogen at minus 253 degrees Celsius was filled into two 40kg tanks mounted on either side of the truck chassis.

Because the vehicle tanks have exceptional insulation, the hydrogen can be kept at temperature for a sufficiently long time without active cooling. Both tanks were sealed before the start of the drive to TÜV Rheinland.

Daimler Truck prefers liquid hydrogen in the development of hydrogen-based drives.

In this aggregate state the energy carrier has a significantly higher energy density in relation to volume compared to gaseous hydrogen.

As a result, “more hydrogen can be carried, which significantly increases the range and enables comparable performance of the vehicle with that of a conventional diesel truck,” the company said.

Three years have passed since Daimler Truck announced in Berlin the commitment to invest in hydrogen technology.

CEO Martin Daum presented the Mercedes-Benz GenH2 Truck Concept for the first time to the public to underline the company’s technology strategy.

This was followed up by establishing cellcentric, a joint venture with Volvo Group, which will put one of Europe’s largest production facilities for fuel-cells in operation.

The first fuel-cell trucks are expected to be tested in customer hands in the coming years, while the goal remains firmly set to introduce the series version of the Mercedes-Benz GenH2 Truck in the second half of the decade.​"
Renewable Hydrogen Project In Normandy Gets 200 MW Capacity Boost From Siemens Energy - H2 News - Hydrogen News - Green Hydrogen Report,"Thu, 21 Sep 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmh5ZHJvZ2VuZnVlbG5ld3MuY29tL3JlbmV3YWJsZS1oeWRyb2dlbi1zaWVtZW5zLWFpci84NTYwODc4L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide’s Normand’Hy project will receive electrolyzers from the German company

Siemens Energy is set to supply 12 electrolyzers with a total capacity of 200 megawatts (MW) to Air Liquide, which will use them for operation in its Normand’Hy project in Normandy, France, to produce renewable hydrogen.

The project is expected to generate 28,000 tons of green H2 annually.

Beginning in 2026, Air Liquide’s plant located in the Port-Jérôme industrial zone, will produce 28,000 tons of renewable hydrogen per year for industry as well as the mobility sector. To put this into greater perspective, with this amount, a hydrogen-fueled road truck could drive around the world 10,000 times.

The low carbon hydrogen made possible by Siemens Energy’s electrolyzers will contribute to Air Liquide’s decarbonization of the Normandy industrial basin and mobility.

The low carbon hydrogen produced will result in as much as 250,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions being saved every year. Under other circumstances, it would take as many as 25 million trees to bind this amount of CO2.

The electrolyzers designed to produce renewable hydrogen are based on PEM tech.

According to Siemens Energy, PEM (proton exchange membrane) electrolysis is highly compatible to intermittent renewable energy supply. This is due to PEM technology having short ramp-up time and dynamic controllability. As such, the technology is ideally suited for the quick ramp-up of the hydrogen industry because of its high energy density, small materials requirement and minimal carbon footprint.

Without renewable hydrogen (green hydrogen), the sustainable decarbonization of industry would be unthinkable, says Anne Laure de Chammard, a Siemens Energy Executive Board member, which is why these types of projects are so vital.

“But they can only be a starting point for a sustainable transformation of the industrial landscape,” Laure de Chammard adds. “Other large-scale projects must follow quickly. For the development of a European hydrogen economy to succeed, we need reliable support from policymakers and simplified procedures for funding and approving such projects.”

Supplying hydrogen projects across the globe.

Though the Normand’Hy project will be one of the first to be supplied from Siemens Energy’s new electrolyzer production facility in Berlin, the company intends to scale up its production and supply renewable hydrogen projects around the world.

Industrial series production of its stacks is slated to begin in November and, by 2025, production is expected to ramp up to a minimum of 3 gigawatts (GW) annually.
