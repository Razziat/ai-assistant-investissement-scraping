Air Liquide sues Carlyle over theft of trade secrets - Chemical & Engineering News,"Thu, 05 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vY2VuLmFjcy5vcmcvcG9saWN5L2ludGVsbGVjdHVhbC1wcm9wZXJ0eS9BaXItTGlxdWlkZS1zdWVzLUNhcmx5bGUtb3Zlci85Ni9pMjjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Credit: Linde

Air Liquide has filed a lawsuit alleging that the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm, hired a senior Air Liquide executive as part of a scheme to get its hands on confidential business information. That information could give Carlyle the upper hand in acquiring Praxair and Linde industrial gas assets being auctioned as part of the $70 billion merger of the two gases giants, announced in December 2016.

Japanese industrial gas maker Taiyo Nippon Sanso agreed on July 5 to buy Praxair’s European gas business for nearly $6 billion. Taiyo, which is not now active in Europe, would get a business with annual sales of $1.5 billion, 2,500 employees, and operations in 12 countries. Carlyle and other suitors are still in the running for U.S. gas assets. Both sales are intended to quell antitrust concerns.

The deal with Taiyo brings Praxair and Linde a step closer to tying the knot and forming the world’s largest industrial gas maker, with over $30 billion in annual sales. Air Liquide, the current number one, has sales of about $23 billion.

Carlyle declined to comment on the Air Liquide suit. However, industry sources indicate that the private equity firm continues to pursue a deal for the remaining Praxair and Linde assets.

For its part, Air Liquide wants an injunction issued against Carlyle and the executive, Leslie Graff, formerly Air Liquide’s vice president for mergers and acquisitions in the Americas. The suit aims to prevent use of the allegedly stolen information and seeks the return of the stolen files and monetary damages against both Carlyle and Graff.

According to the suit, filed in a Pennsylvania federal court on June 12 but only recently publicized, Carlyle began talking with Graff in January about how he might help the private equity firm acquire Praxair and Linde assets. For three months prior to his resignation from Air Liquide at the end of April, the lawsuit charges, Graff absconded with a collection of documents that “would provide any company looking to compete in this market ... highly relevant and nearly invaluable information for guiding its investments and expenditures.”

Among the documents Graff allegedly downloaded to his personal email were financial valuation models and distributor prospect lists. Just before he tendered his resignation, the lawsuit charges, Graff viewed documents that detailed revenue and market share information for Air Liquide and its competitors."
Air Liquide supplying xenon and krypton to semiconductor and satellite industries - gasworld,"Tue, 10 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdhc3dvcmxkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9haXItbGlxdWlkZS1zdXBwbHlpbmcteGVub24tYW5kLWtyeXB0b24tdG8tc2VtaWNvbmR1Y3Rvci1hbmQtc2F0ZWxsaXRlLWluZHVzdHJpZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide supplying xenon and krypton to semiconductor and satellite industries

Air Liquide has signed several new multi-year contracts worth more than €50m ($59m) and has been supplying xenon and krypton to the semiconductor and the satellite industries in three regions – Europe, US and Asia – since the beginning of 2018.

The Tier One corporation’s customers benefit from Air Liquide’s global logistics organisation deployed in 30 countries, which enables the delivery of these high value-added molecules, extracted from air gases in the Group’s large production facilities.

The semiconductor industry uses xenon or krypton in its new processes to produce high-end flash memories at a lower cost, supporting the increasing need to store and move massive quantities of data.

In the space industry, the all-electric propulsion satellites also use xenon. The all-electric propulsion is based on the energy produced by the satellite’s solar panels to accelerate and eject a gas (xenon) resulting in the motion of the satellite generated by the thrust. All-electric engines reduce the satellite’s weight by about 35%, greatly reducing launching costs. In the coming years, at least half of the market is expected to adopt this technology."
Hydrogen car owners finally get an app to locate fuel pumps - Santa Monica Daily Press,"Mon, 30 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vc21kcC5jb20vMjAxOC8wNy8zMC9oeWRyb2dlbi1jYXItb3duZXJzLWZpbmFsbHktZ2V0LWFuLWFwcC10by1sb2NhdGUtZnVlbC1wdW1wcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Clean energy and sustainability rule the roost here in Santa Monica. Bikes, Birds, Teslas and hybrids all dominate the city at any given moment, but there’s one type of clean-energy transportation that’s not easily visible– hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.

According to cafcp.org (California Fuel Cell Partnership), only 4,926 hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) are on the road right now. For these drivers, only 35 hydrogen fueling stations exist in California — locally, there’s one on 1819 Cloverfield Blvd and one currently in development at 1866 Lincoln Boulevard — with no easy way to find a station aside from googling around and eventually landing at cafcp.org, the Department of Energy’s website, or other (potentially unreliable) sources.

AirLiquide, a French multinational company, is hoping to make life easier for the FCV loving crowd; the company created the just-launched H2 Station Finder app to help users locate one of 39 stations throughout the country.

In addition to the app, AirLiquide is also betting big on the niche technology, having designed and installed hundreds of hydrogen fueling stations themselves to help build hydrogen-powered infrastructure.

While automotive manufacturers seem hesitant on the tech (Toyota seems to be the only manufacturer truly dedicated to the alternative fuel, announcing mass production and lower costs for FCVs), time will tell if the bet pays off and this alternative fuel makes a splash with consumers.

In the meantime, the Daily Press talked to AirLiquide CEO Ole Hoefelmann to discuss his app and hopes for an alternative fuel filleded future.

The only hydrogen pump on Santa Monica is on 1819 Cloverfield Blvd with the other closest station being 11261 Santa Monica Blvd, Los Angeles correct? Just want to get that fact correct for Santa Monicans that may be driving a FCV. Yes, that is correct. There is another hydrogen station set to launch early next year, and it is located at 1866 Lincoln Boulevard.

What made AirLiquide decide to invest in hydrogen fueling stations?

We believe that hydrogen is one of the key solutions to a cleaner transportation future. Hydrogen-powered vehicles have many advantages: zero carbon emissions, zero particulate emissions and zero noise at their point of use. Used in the fuel cell, hydrogen combines with oxygen from the air to produce electricity (to propel the vehicle), with water as the only by­product. As a result, for equal distance traveled, hydrogen cars allow for reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 20% compared with an internal combustion vehicle.

Given hydrogen’s great potential to provide clean energy, Air Liquide has — for years — made great strides contributing to the growing use of hydrogen in the transportation sector by supporting the development of the hydrogen energy infrastructure around the world. To date, 100 hydrogen fueling stations have been designed and installed by Air Liquide worldwide.

How does AirLiquide forecast hydrogen fuel cells future compared to hybrids and all-electric vehicles?

According to the “Hydrogen, Scaling up” study conducted by the Hydrogen Council, by 2050, the market should be worth US$2.5 trillion and involve over 30 million skilled jobs around the world.

Besides the obvious of not having an app to map out hydrogen fuel locations, what other factors led to the creation of this app?

At Air Liquide, we routinely conduct focus group discussions, and ultimately, participants shared that it was challenging to find a hydrogen station near them. Prior to the launch of our app, drivers were only able to locate a hydrogen station through a website offered by the California Fuel Cell Partnership (CaFCP) — however, this had limited functionality as it only provided drivers with the station name and whether it was online or offline. We believed it to be important to provide a consumer-friendly resource to hydrogen drivers that allowed them to get to where they need to go, when they needed to go with complete ease.

What benefits (besides locating stations) will this app bring users?

The app introduces a streamlined user experience and several functionalities, including the ability to rate a station, get directions to a station, view how much CO2 drivers are reducing, connect with other hydrogen drivers, provide real-time feedback on a station, and view details of the station, such as amenities offered.

What hopes do you have for the app?

With this app, we hope that this will give hydrogen drivers convenience, connectivity, security, and ultimately, a more positive experience on the road.

How can/will AirLiquide interest consumers in hydrogen vehicles? It’s very niche compared to other alternative fuels.

Air Liquide is proud to be on the forefront of hydrogen fuel cell technology and the deployment of the necessary supporting infrastructure. In order for hydrogen energy to be fully embraced among consumers as a clean mode of transportation, there needs to be a greater number of hydrogen vehicles. For this to happen, we believe that a strong collaboration must exist with OEMs, such as Hyundai and Toyota, who have both launched Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles(FCEV): the Hyundai IX35 and the Toyota Mirai.

Assuming the app will be made available for both Android and iOS, correct? That is correct."

Enerkem to Make Methanol Through Gasification in Netherlands - waste360,"Tue, 17 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc3RlMzYwLmNvbS9nYXMtdG8tZW5lcmd5L2VuZXJrZW0tdG8tbWFrZS1tZXRoYW5vbC10aHJvdWdoLWdhc2lmaWNhdGlvbi1pbi1uZXRoZXJsYW5kc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Now that Enerkem’s Edmonton, Alberta, waste-to-cellulosic ethanol plant is running at full scale, the company has turned to the Netherlands for a larger conversion project. It plans to tap into some of the 2 million tons of municipal solid waste (MSW) shipped to Port Rotterdam yearly to produce methanol through gasification—diverting what would have headed elsewhere for incineration, while creating an alternative to fossil fuel, mainly for manufacturing and transportation fuel blends.

Two companies join the Enerkem-Port Rotterdam partnership: Amsterdam-based chemical company AkzoNobel, which wants to shift from fossil fuel to other raw materials to make its products, and Air Liquide, an industrial gas company headquartered in Paris that will supply gases to the plant for its waste-to-methanol production process.

“All four partners have complementary strategies, with the main one being to work on shifting from fossil fuels to alternative fuels,” says Anton de Vries, an Enerkem director who leads the project.

The port not only is rich in feedstock and potential end users but is uniquely positioned to support infrastructure. It has existing resources to ship methanol via truck or boat as well as to move trash from the U.K. and Northern Europe, which de Vries says has made it fairly easy to capture materials through agreements with waste management suppliers.

Air Liquide’s interest and involvement will likely eventually expand beyond Rotterdam, de Vries projects. “We plan to one day sell our plants all over the world so they could follow us to other locations,” he explains.

AkzoNobel has its own vision.

“The production and use of methanol fits into the sustainability strategy of AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals. It will enable us to provide products to our customers with the best environmental profile in the market,” says Marco Waas, director of research, development and innovation and technology with AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals.

“We expect that the Enerkem technology can in the future be used to produce other key chemical building blocks like acetic acid and various components that can be used as fuel and resins,” adds Waas.

Waas says he sees the project as an important step toward increasing the sustainability of its industry cluster in Rotterdam. But the company’s aim beyond, he points out, “Would be to ensure further implementation of the Enerkem technology in our other industry clusters in Europe as a key element of our sustainability strategy.”

The Rotterdam plant, costing nearly $232,235,000, will gasify 300,000 tons of waste a year, producing more than 200,000 tons of methanol. The gasification process will avoid about 300,000 tons of CO2 emissions that would have been generated through incineration, according to de Vries.

The patented technology can break down chemically and structurally dissimilar waste, including plastic materials, into a pure syngas. The syngas can then be converted into commercial-grade methanol.

This project helps the Port of Rotterdam support the government in working toward greenhouse gas reduction targets for 2030 and 2050: 49 percent and 95 percent, respectively (from 1990 emissions).

“There is a large industry sector (electricity production, chemicals, refineries) in the port area in Rotterdam that is dependent on fossil fuel,” says Bert Regeer, spokesperson of the Port of Rotterdam Authority. “There is a huge challenge to be successful in the energy transition and at the same time maintain a vital port of world class in the future.”

“Against this background, the Port of Rotterdam Authority installed a dedicated team that is building coalitions for energy transition projects that help the port to become carbon neutral on the road toward 2050,” he adds. “This is an important project to make tangible progress on the short term with the energy transition.”

The Rotterdam plant is in the design phase, with construction slated to begin sometime in 2019 and launch planned for 2020.

Construction is expected to create about 600 to 700 direct and indirect jobs. Once in operation, the plant will create about 150 to 200 direct and indirect jobs, says de Vries, who reports Enerkem is now contracting with waste suppliers and negotiating contracts with methanol buyers.

The company’s eventual plans are to build out, having modules constructed in different parts of the world to be assembled in Rotterdam and shipped out. The demand is there, de Vries notes.

“[Using methanol as a building block] becomes a marketing tool, and we see it having a lot of pull. Manufacturers are asking for products that will use a methanol biobase,” he says. “We anticipate this plant, which is the first of its kind in Europe, opening the door for similar future facilities in other parts of Europe.”"

"Harold 'Hap' Wagner, former Air Products CEO and community leader, dies at 82 - The Morning Call","Tue, 31 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1jYWxsLmNvbS8yMDE4LzA3LzMxL2hhcm9sZC1oYXAtd2FnbmVyLWZvcm1lci1haXItcHJvZHVjdHMtY2VvLWFuZC1jb21tdW5pdHktbGVhZGVyLWRpZXMtYXQtODIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Harold A. “Hap” Wagner, Air Products’ fourth CEO in company history, died last week in California. He was 82.

An Oakland native, Wagner joined Air Products in 1963 after serving in the U.S. Air Force’s Strategic Air Command and earning a mechanical engineering degree from Stanford and an M.B.A. from Harvard.

He became president of Air Products Europe in 1988 and executive vice president of world gases and equipment in 1990. The following year, Wagner was named president and chief operating officer, and in 1992 he was elected chairman and CEO, succeeding Dexter F. Baker.

“Our Air Products family is greatly saddened by Hap’s passing, and we extend our deepest sympathies to the Wagner family,” Seifi Ghasemi, Air Products’ chairman, president and chief executive officer, said in a statement. “Hap focused on building strong positions in key markets, expanding Air Products’ presence globally, and developing people’s leadership skills – all initiatives that continue to serve us well today.”

The company grew considerably under Wagner’s leadership, with annual sales increasing to $5 billion from $3 billion. Air Products’ net income in Wagner’s last year was $530 million, double its profit in his first year.

Air Products had 5,000 employees in the Lehigh Valley and 17,000 worldwide when he retired in December 2000.

During his tenure, the company expanded its presence in Asia and became worldwide leader in the production of a cleaning material for the burgeoning semiconductor industry.

There was also disappointment. In 1999, Air Products and Air Liquide teamed up on an $11 billion takeover of British gas company BOC Group, but to the surprise of the company and industry analysts, the Federal Trade Commission killed the deal the following year.

Hap Wagner gave the commencement address at Lehigh University’s January 2000 ceremony.

Wagner was also involved in the community, serving on Lehigh University’s board of trustees, the board of directors of KidsPeace National Council and the board of trustees of the Eisenhower Fellowships.

As board chairman of the Dorothy Rider Pool Health Care Trust from 1996 to 2005, he oversaw the distribution of more than $50 million in grant awards to support programs and services that improved the health of the citizens of the Lehigh Valley, executive director Edward F. Meehan said Tuesday.

Wagner pushed the Trust to take a broader view of individual and community health, including the roles of education and public safety. As chairman, he was “demanding in all the right ways,” Meehan said.

“When I met with him, I always had to be very prepared,” Meehan said. “He was very focused and sought to understand the big picture of what needed to be done. We are very saddened to hear of his passing.”

Those skills also came in handy in Wagner’s capacity as a corporate board member. He was chairman of Allentown-based Agere Systems Inc. when it was spun out of Lucent Technologies in 2002 and when it merged with LSI Corp. in 2007.

He also served on the board of directors of United Techologies Corp., Maersk, CIGNA, PACCAR and Arsenal Digital Solutions Worldwide. The Financial Times Outstanding Directors Exchange honored him in 2006 for his “ability to crystallize issues and get everyone on the same page.”

Wagner received honorary doctorates from Lehigh University, Moravian College and DeSales University.

His death comes less than 16 months after Ed Donley, Air Products’ second CEO and prominent community leader, died at 95."

C&EN's Global Top 50 chemical companies of 2017 - Chemical & Engineering News,"Mon, 30 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vY2VuLmFjcy5vcmcvYnVzaW5lc3MvZmluYW5jZS9DRU5zLUdsb2JhbC1Ub3AtNTAtY2hlbWljYWwvOTYvaTMx0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Chemical executives should remember 2017 fondly. According to C&EN's annual survey of the Global Top 50 chemical companies, sales rose strongly for the group, and profits did even better.

The 50 companies combined for $851.0 billion in chemical sales for 2017, the fiscal year on which the survey is based, a 12.2% increase from the year before. Only nine of the firms saw sales decline. This is a turnaround from recent surveys, as the Global Top 50 had seen sales decline in 2015 and 2016. A strong economy and rising oil prices led to the revenue increase.

Profitability swelled for the 48 of the 50 large chemical firms that publicly report profit figures. The companies combined for $108.6 billion in chemical earnings last year, a 14.4% increase from the year-ago period. No company lost money, and merely 13 reported a decline in profits.

The world economy continues to perform well this year, and the chemical industry should benefit from that once again. However, one storm cloud on the horizon is trade. Should the U.S. and China go through with a trade war and mark $200 billion in products for tariffs, the chemical industry—particularly U.S. petrochemical makers—could see an adverse impact.

This is the era of the chemical merger, and that trend has led to the debut of DowDuPont on the list at number 2. Linde's merger with Praxair and a potential LyondellBasell Industries acquisition of Braskem could affect future rankings.

But on the whole, C&EN's Global Top 50 looks much as it did a year ago. Only two companies that appeared in the last survey—British catalyst firm Johnson Matthey and U.S. specialty chemical maker Lubrizol—didn't have the sales to make the cut this year. They were replaced by Chinese polyurethane juggernaut Wanhua Chemical and U.S. petrochemical maker Westlake Chemical.

BASF

2017 chemical sales: $69.2 billion

Despite the merger between Dow Chemical and DuPont, BASF maintains the top spot in C&EN's Global Top 50. DowDuPont launched in August and didn't have the full-year results to overtake the German chemical giant. BASF is hardly sitting still itself. The company is mulling its largest-ever investment: a $10 billion integrated chemical complex in Guangdong, China, that would start coming on-line in 2026. BASF also has been making acquisitions. It is spending $9 billion on seed and agricultural chemical businesses from Bayer, which needed to dispose of them to get its acquisition of Monsanto past regulators. The purchase will give BASF about $10 billion in total ag sales and mark its entry into the seed business. BASF is also buying Solvay's nylon business for $1.9 billion. Marking an exit from the energy sector, BASF plans to merge its Wintershall oil and gas businesses with German rival DEA. BASF also made a change at the top. In May, Kurt Bock, BASF's leader throughout most of the 2010s, passed the baton to Martin Brudermüller, a Ph.D. chemist who continues to serve as BASF's chief technology officer.

DowDuPont

2017 chemical sales: $62.5 billion

DowDuPont was born last August, a full 20 months after Dow Chemical and DuPont signed their merger agreement. Because the company's sales figure reflects results from Dow for a full year but from DuPont only since September, it hasn't knocked BASF out of the top spot. A full year of results for 2018 might change that when C&EN's next Global Top 50 survey drops a year from now. If all goes according to management's plan, 2018 should be the only year we know DowDuPont as a company. It is scheduled to break into three companies, all of which should comfortably make the ranking, in 2019. One will be a materials science company with about $44 billion in annual sales. It will bear the Dow name and be led by longtime Dow executive Jim Fitterling. Except for some packaging plastics businesses from the old DuPont, this company will be made up mostly of former Dow businesses. A new DuPont, constructed with former DuPont businesses plus electronic and other assorted specialty materials operations from Dow, will have $21 billion in sales. Agricultural chemicals and seeds from both companies will be the nucleus of a new firm with $14 billion in revenues, Corteva Agriscience.

Sinopec

2017 chemical sales: $55.3 billion

The past few months have been tough for China's largest chemical producer. In May, an explosion in a benzene tank at the Secco Petrochemical facility in Shanghai killed six contract workers who were performing repairs. Sinopec had taken over the facility from partner BP for $1.7 billion just last year. Meanwhile, the Chinese push to improve air quality by switching from coal to natural gas heating led to a temporary natural gas shortage last winter, snarling chemical production in the country. However, 2017 was a good year for the company. It saw a 32% increase in sales. In a positive development for the firm, its Nanjing-based joint venture with BASF plans to double capacity for neopentyl glycol.

4

SABIC

2017 chemical sales: $37.6 billion

SABIC aspires to go deeper into specialty chemicals as a way to move beyond making bulk petrochemicals in its oil- and gas-rich home base of Saudi Arabia. This was the justification for its purchase of engineering polymer maker GE Plastics a decade ago. It was also the impetus behind SABIC's purchase of a 25% stakein the Swiss specialty chemical maker Clariant, 50th on this list, earlier this year for $2.4 billion. The two firms were already partners in the chemical process firm Scientific Design. SABIC's petrochemical business is diversifying geographically. It signed an agreement with ExxonMobil to build a massive petrochemical complex near Corpus Christi, Texas. And with Saudi national oil company Saudi Aramco, SABIC plans a crude-oil-to-chemicals plant that would have 9 million metric tons per year of output. Ties between the two Saudi firms may deepen: Saudi Aramco recently said it wants to buy a stake in SABIC.

5

Ineos

2017 chemical sales: $34.6 billion

Ineos and its founder, the energetic billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, are helping resuscitate the European petrochemical industry, which was rendered nearly irrelevant by the cheap shale-derived feedstocks available to U.S. petrochemical makers. Ineos's solution was to haul U.S. ethane to Europe on purpose-built ships. Those raw materials have been feeding Ineos's ethylene crackers in Scotland and Norway. Now Ineos plans to expand those plants and spend an additional $3 billion on a new European propane dehydrogenation plant and the first ethylene cracker the continent has seen in a generation. The British company is also building a vinyl acetate plant in Europe. Ineos is investing in the U.S. too. It plans an ethylene oxide and derivatives complex and an α-olefins plant, both on the Gulf Coast.

6

Formosa Plastics

2017 chemical sales: $32.1 billion

Formosa Plastics, an affiliate of Formosa Petrochemical, appears to be moving forward on a $9.4 billion ethylene cracker complex, dubbed the Sunshine Project, in Louisiana. The Taiwanese company has purchased a 1,000-hectare tract along the Mississippi River in St. James Parish, La. Construction may begin next year and peak at 8,000 construction workers engaged at site. At its Taiwan home base, Formosa continues to battle environmental activists and farmers who live near its facilities. The company is mulling building a water desalination plant at its giant Mailiao complex to assuage concerns that it is using too much freshwater from the area.

7

ExxonMobil

2017 chemical sales: $28.7 billion

Advertisement

ExxonMobil is always working on at least one major petrochemical project. Soon the company could be juggling two. ExxonMobil has just put the final touches on a new ethylene cracker in Baytown, Texas. Now it is advancing a $10 billion complex a bit farther down the coast in San Patricio County, Texas, near Corpus Christi. It has signed a joint-venture agreement with SABIC for the project, and construction will commence once the environmental permits are in. It is also evaluating a project in Guangdong, China, that would feature an ethylene cracker and downstream derivatives.

LyondellBasell Industries

2017 chemical sales: $28.3 billion

Basell's expensive purchase of Lyondell Chemical on the eve of the financial crisis in 2007 forced the newly minted LyondellBasell Industries into bankruptcy a year later. The company has been fiscally conservative ever since it emerged from Chapter 11 in 2010. Instead of building multi-billion-dollar U.S. crackers as its rivals did, it has opted for cheaper, incremental expansions. This frugality has garnered it much admiration in the financial community. But under Bob Patel, who took over as CEO in 2015, the company has been investing more assertively. It is spending $2.4 billion to build the world's largest propylene oxide and tert-butyl alcohol facility, in Channelview, Texas. And LyondellBasell is back on the acquisition path with the purchase of plastics compounder A. Schulman for $2.25 billion. That deal may prove to be small potatoes compared to what the company is considering next. In an acquisition that would be its largest since bankruptcy, LyondellBasell is negotiating to buy a majority stake in the Brazilian petrochemical maker Braskem, number 19 in this ranking. The purchase price could exceed $10 billion.

Mitsubishi Chemical

2017 chemical sales: $26.4 billion

Mitsubishi Chemical's industrial gas arm, Taiyo Nippon Sanso, has been the firm's most active division. The gas company is poised to enter the European market through the purchase of Praxair's European gas business for $6 billion. The Praxair business, with annual sales of $1.5 billion, is part of a package of several divestitures being made so Linde can win European Commission approval for its merger with Praxair. This isn't the first time Taiyo Nippon Sanso made such a purchase. In 2016, its U.S. affiliate Matheson Tri-Gas bought air-separation and other plants in the U.S. that regulators forced Air Liquide to divest during its takeover of Airgas.

10

LG Chem

2017 chemical sales: $23.2 billion

As its electronic and battery materials business segment grows, LG Chem is planning a massive R&D expansion. By the turn of the next decade, it wants to boost its R&D headcount by 800, to 6,300 people. It is also launching an innovation contest promising grants of up to $150,000 to scientists working in materials, biotechnology, and other fields. On the capital spending front, LG and China's Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt are investing $450 million to set up a pair of Chinese joint ventures making cathode materials for electric vehicle batteries.

11

Air Liquide

2017 chemical sales: $22.6 billion

Air Liquide is about to be knocked off its perch as the world's largest industrial gas maker. Rival Linde is merging with U.S. leader Praxair, and combined they should edge out the French firm. Air Liquide continues to grow even without major acquisitions. Earlier this year, the company started up biomethane plants in the U.S., France, and the U.K., doubling capacity for the fuel, which it extracts from landfills and other sources of waste. It has also invested more than $10 million in the Chinese start-up STNE, which operates a fleet of 500 hydrogen-powered delivery trucks.

12

Reliance Industries

2017 chemical sales: $17.6 billion

The Indian conglomerate is probably best known for operating the world's largest refinery in Jamnagar, India; being India's largest petrochemical maker; and even for running telecommunications operations and supermarkets. In a first for the region, the company has begun importing ethane from the U.S. in six new ships and is using this ethane to feed three Indian ethylene crackers. And through its recent purchase of Kemrock Industries, the company is now eyeing another world to conquer: carbon fiber composites.

13

DuPont

2017 chemical sales: $17.3 billion

DuPont merged with Dow Chemical to become DowDuPont last August, but it had enough sales all by itself for eight months to make C&EN's ranking one last time. Eventually, the name DuPont will emblazon a new Wilmington, Del.-based chemical company made up mostly of old DuPont businesses, such as food ingredients and construction materials. It will also have a few gems from Dow, such as electronic materials and construction products. In May, DowDuPont CEO Ed Breen, speaking in front of an audience in New York City, gave some clues about how this new company will be run. It will shun ""moon shot"" R&D projects, deeply encoded in the DNA of the old DuPont, in favor of smaller-scale programs. It will trim 5–10% of its portfolio. Foreshadowing a potential future breakup, he reminded the audience that the new DuPont will consist of four businesses that could stand alone as separate companies.

Linde

2017 chemical sales: $16.9 billion

Germany's Linde is close to becoming the largest industrial gas maker in the world with its merger with Praxair. Combined, the firms generated about $28.4 billion in sales for 2017, nearly $6 billion more than the current leader, Air Liquide. But the German and French gas giants may end up a bit closer in size than that. Regulators want Linde to slough off some assets for competition reasons. Praxair has inked an agreement to sell its European business, which had $1.5 billion in annual sales, to Taiyo Nippon Sanso. Linde also signed a deal under which the private equity firm CVC Capital Partners and the German industrial gas maker Messer will buy Linde's U.S. gas business and some of its South American assets for $3.3 billion.

15

Toray Industries

2017 chemical sales: $16.9 billion

Toray Industries continues to invest big in its core carbon fiber composites business. It is paying $1.15 billion for TenCate Advanced Composites, which specializes in carbon fiber prepreg—carbon fiber impregnated with resin—for the production of small and medium aircraft. However, the Japanese firm has recently been hit by scandal. Late last year, the company fessed up to faking quality-control measurements on out-of-spec industrial fiber. Toray claims that it missed quality specifications by an insignificant amount.

16

AkzoNobel

2017 chemical sales: $16.5 billion

After rejecting a $28 billion takeover offer from paint rival PPG Industries, AkzoNobel management promised to spin off its specialty chemical unit, which analysts said would raise between $8 billion and $12 billion. Akzo exceeded these expectations, inking an agreement in March to sell the business to the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm, for $12.5 billion. The specialty chemical business generated $5.6 billion in sales in 2017, which wouldn't have been enough to make C&EN's ranking on its own. Akzo also did what many observers expected it to: It attempted to negotiate the purchase of Axalta Coating Systems, DuPont's former paint business. Axalta abandoned those talks to focus on overtures from Nippon Paint, which likewise yielded no deal.

17

Evonik Industries

2017 chemical sales: $16.3 billion

As part of a restructuring, Evonik Industries is cutting 1,000 jobs—mostly in administration and sales and much of them in its home country of Germany. The company aims to save $230 million annually. Evonik is also exploring the sale of its methacrylates unit, which isn't growing at the pace of other businesses, such as animal nutrition and specialty additives. The company has been spending generously on expansion. It will spend nearly $500 million on a plant in Marl, Germany, for nylon 12 and precursors by 2021. It is also laying out $120 million to build a precipitated silica plant in Charleston, S.C., and $50 million to expand fumed silica capacity in Antwerp, Belgium. The company completed the $3.8 billion purchase of Air Products' specialty chemical business, its largest deal ever, in 2017.

18

Covestro

2017 chemical sales: $16.0 billion

Covestro's last tie to its former parent, Bayer, is nearly severed: Bayer's ownership stake in Covestro is down to 6.8%. Covestro also has a new CEO. Former chief commercial officer Markus Steilemann took the helm last month from Patrick Thomas, who is soon to be nonexecutive chair of Johnson Matthey. Otherwise, Covestro has been rolling out modest investments. The company is spending about $235 million to expand methylene diphenyl diisocyanate capacity and build a new chlorine plant in Tarragona, Spain. For that new plant, the German company is installing an oxygen-depolarized cathode that will allow it to make chlorine and caustic soda without coproduct hydrogen, saving energy.

19

Braskem

2017 chemical sales: $15.4 billion

Brazil's petrochemical giant may soon cease to exist as an independent company. LyondellBasell Industries is negotiating a purchase of a majority stake in the firm from Brazilian conglomerate Odebrecht. A report in Brazil suggests that the parties may come to terms on a deal in October and that the transaction may include Braskem's minority shareholder, state oil company Petrobras. Braskem was founded in 2002 following a government auction of a plant in Camaçari, Brazil. It went on to consolidate almost the entire Brazilian petrochemical industry over the following decade. It also expanded overseas, building a cracker complex in Mexico and buying out polypropylene businesses from Dow Chemical and Sunoco. However, a massive corruption scandal ensnared the company and its owners, who are now seeking a sale to raise money.

20

PPG Industries

2017 chemical sales: $14.8 billion

PPG Industries' $28 billion offer last year to acquire AkzoNobel was rejected, and a hostile takeover was impossible given the peculiarities of Akzo's corporate structure. To date, PPG hasn't mounted another offensive against its Dutch rival, falling back instead to the peacetime duties of running its businesses and distributing cash to shareholders. In a high-tech development, it is partnering with the start-up SiNode Systems to manufacture high-energy anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. The silicon-graphene materials make for higher-capacity, faster-charging batteries, the partners say.

21

Sumitomo Chemical

2017 chemical sales: $14.6 billion

The past year has seen Sumitomo Chemical rack up many small acquisitions. It purchased a 20% stake in the Japanese biotech firm Bonac, which is developing nucleic acid drug candidates. In agriculture, it bought Kyowa Hakko Bio's plant growth regulator business. Sumitomo also acquired control of Botanical Resources Australia, a Tasmanian firm that extracts pyrethrins, used as organic insecticides, from Dalmatian chrysanthemum. In an organic growth initiative of its own, Sumitomo is spending $150 million to establish a semiconductor materials facility in Changzhou, China.

22

Lotte Chemical

2017 chemical sales: $14.1 billion

The chemical arm of the South Korean conglomerate Lotte has nearly completed the most ambitious U.S. project ever undertaken by a Korean chemical firm. The company's $3 billion ethylene joint venture with Westlake Chemical in Lake Charles, La., is scheduled to start up during the first half of next year. The timing of the facility is just as the companies predicted when they broke ground in June 2016. Lotte is also constructing its own ethylene glycol plant in Lake Charles.

23

Shin-Etsu Chemical

2017 chemical sales: $12.9 billion

Shin-Etsu Chemical, like many Japanese chemical firms, had an exceptional year in 2017. Its profits shot up by more than 40%, and sales rose 17%. Shin-Etsu credited strong performance in polyvinyl chloride and electronic materials. Looking for more growth, Shin-Etsu is investing $175 million to expand cellulose derivatives in Japan and Germany. It will also lay out $1.5 billion to boost vinyls in Plaquemine, La. (see story page 15).

24

Solvay

2017 chemical sales: $12.3 billion

In recent years, Solvay has divested some of its traditional chemical businesses, like vinyls and cellulose acetate, in favor of specialty chemicals. In the latest such move, the Belgian company inked an agreement to sell its nylon 6,6 business to BASF for $1.9 billion. The European Commission is investigating that deal because of fears over BASF's resulting large market share in engineering polymers. The transition to specialties also spurred a reorganization of R&D. The company is cutting about 600 jobs, though it won't say how many are scientists. It is also transferring some 500 employees from Paris and Aubervilliers, France, to Lyon, France, and Brussels.

25

Mitsui Chemicals

2017 chemical sales: $11.9 billion

Mitsui Chemicals' dental materials business bit back earlier this year. Because of disappointing sales, Mitsui wrote off $130 million from the value of the unit, which it bought from the German firm Heraeus in 2013 for $576 million. Undeterred, Mitsui bought a 30% stake in B9Creations, which makes three-dimensional printers used in the jewelry industry. Mitsui wants to repurpose the ­machines for dental materials. Separately, the Japanese company is building a new line in Ohio for an olefinic thermoplastic elastomer. It also licensed the rights to quinofumelin—a fungicide used on fruit, vegetables, oilseeds, and rice—to Bayer.

26

Praxair

2017 chemical sales: $11.4 billion

With Linde's merger with Praxair nearing approval, this is likely to be Praxair's final appearance in the C&EN ranking. The industrial gas company was a part of a bigger firm once before. It was a division of Union Carbide, then a chemical conglomerate, before being spun off in 1992. Shareholders will remember the independent Praxair for delivering strong returns year in and year out. And its 2017 operating profit margin, among the largest in the Global Top 50, shows that Praxair is going out at the peak of its game.

27

Yara

2017 chemical sales: $11.3 billion

The Norwegian fertilizer giant has been growing like gangbusters in recent years and is still in expansion mode. It opened a joint-venture ammonia plant with BASF in Freeport, Texas, in April. A month later, it completed the purchase, for $255 million, of a nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers complex in Cubatão, Brazil. It isn't all about big fertilizer plants for Yara. Last year, it purchased Agronomic Technology, which sells digital farming software developed at Cornell University.

28

Lanxess

2017 chemical sales: $10.9 billion

Lanxess's board must like the job its CEO Matthias Zachert has been doing for the past four years because it re-upped his contract until April 1, 2024. The company is absorbing brominated flame retardants maker Chemtura, which it purchased last year for $2.5 billion. Lanxess now aims to save $120 million annually at Chemtura by reducing costs. In a small acquisition meant to augment what it acquired with Chemtura, Lanxess bought Solvay's U.S. business in phosphorus chemicals for agrochemicals and flame retardants. The company is also nibbling at the booming market for lithium, used in batteries. Standard Lithium is paying $3 million for access to lithium in the Arkansas brine from which Lanxess extracts bromine.

29

Bayer

2017 chemical sales: $10.8 billion

Bayer closed its $66 billion purchase of Monsanto last month, nearly two years after it was originally unveiled. After a long review, antitrust regulators finally approved the acquisition—provided that Bayer sell $9 billion in seed and crop protection chemical operations to BASF. Bayer's first major decision after the acquisition was getting rid of the Monsanto name, much demonized among activists who are down on genetically modified organisms. To help pay for Monsanto, Bayer continues to reduce its stake in Covestro, its former materials science business. Bayer has raised more than $10.6 billion in sales of Covestro stock so far.

30

DSM

2017 chemical sales: $9.8 billion

It seems that every year brings heavy investment from DSM in nutrition. Late last year, the Dutch company agreed to buy an Amyris plant in Brazil that makes the biobased chemical building block farnesene for $96 million. The two firms had collaborated since earlier in 2017 with the goal of developing a fermentation route to vitamin A. DSM also invested $50 million in Amyris. More recently, DSM acquired a 50% stake in Mixfit, a start-up that analyzes a person's diet and lifestyle to create personalized beverages containing vitamins and minerals.

31

Asahi Kasei

2017 chemical sales: $9.7 billion

Asahi Kasei has been investing heavily in lithium-ion batteries and high-end materials. Earlier this year, the Japanese firm decided to spend about $70 million to expand its battery separator plants in Shiga, Japan, and North Carolina. Separately, Asahi Kasei is doubling production of synthetic suede in Japan, and it just announced a $1 billion deal to acquire Sage Automotive Interiors, a large suede customer. And with ChemChina subsidiary China National Bluestar, it is building a 30,000-metric-ton-per-year plant for the engineering polymer polyphenylene ether in Nantong, China.

32

Eastman Chemical

2017 chemical sales: $9.5 billion

Eastman Chemical has long had a core made of polyester. And while the company no longer makes polyethylene terephthalate, the company still invests in specialty polyesters. In May, Eastman wrapped up an expansion at its flagship complex in Kingsport, Tenn., for its Tritan copolyester. The product has been taking off in recent years as a bisphenol A-free substitute for polycarbonate. Eastman is also expanding capacity for its Eastar, Spectar, and Aspira copolyesters at the site by 25% and boosting output for its copolyester raw material cyclohexanedimethanol.

33

Arkema

2017 chemical sales: $9.4 billion

All eyes were on an Arkema plant in Crosby, Texas, in August after Tropical Storm Harvey stalled over the Houston area, dumping more than 50 cm of rain. A warehouse loaded with Arkema organic peroxides lost power and backup power. The reactive organic peroxides must be kept refrigerated. The canisters started to burst into flames, fortunately resulting in only minor injuries. It hasn't all been bad news for Arkema. The company is spending $30 million to build a nylon 12 plant in Changshu, China. It's also expanding a polyvinylidene fluoride plant in Calvert City, Ky.

34

Syngenta

2017 chemical sales: $9.2 billion

ChemChina completed its purchase of Syngenta in mid-2017 with a promise to let it operate independently. One subsequent loose end was the sale, for $490 million, to Australia's Nufarm of a portfolio of 50 off-patent pesticides and other products from Syngenta and Adama, ChemChina's existing crop protection business. The European Commission required the divestitures before it allowed the deal to go through. Keeping with the trend of agrochemical companies plunging into digital farming, Syngenta acquired FarmShots, a start-up that allows farmers to use satellite images to assess plant health.

35

Chevron Phillips Chemical

2017 chemical sales: $9.1 billion

Back in 2011, Chevron Phillips Chemical was the first company in more than a decade to announce a new ethylene cracker complex on the U.S. Gulf Coast, part of a $6 billion investment that also included two polyethylene plants. More than a dozen companies eventually followed with U.S. ethylene projects of their own. Chevron Phillips's polyethylene plants came onstream last year, and the company fired up its cracker in March. While the firm was an early shale-gas bull, its new CEO, Mark Lashier, is cautious. He is considering another project but is worried about rising construction costs in the U.S. due to all the activity.

36

Borealis

2017 chemical sales: $8.5 billion

Borealis, a Vienna, Austria-based petrochemical maker controlled by the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment, is experiencing a growth spurt. With Abu Dhabi National Oil, it is planning a new ethylene cracker and derivatives units at the two firms' existing Borouge joint venture in Ruwais, Abu Dhabi. The site's petrochemical output will triple to 14.4 million metric tons by 2025. Borouge already has annual sales of nearly $4 billion. Borealis is also mulling an ethylene cracker and polyethylene complex in Kazakhstan with local partners and is moving forward with a Texas ethylene project with sister company Nova Chemicals and French oil company Total.

37

Indorama

2017 chemical sales: $8.4 billion

Over the past decade, Indorama has grown from an obscure Thai polyester producer to one of the Global Top 50 through acquisition, expansion, and creative combinations of those two. Its most recent deal illustrates this. The company bought a 50% interest in an idle polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plant in Egypt. It is restarting the plant, using raw material purified terephthalic acid from a plant that it bought last year in Portugal. Earlier this year, Indorama and competitors Far Eastern New Century and Alpek teamed up to buy a PET plant under construction in Corpus Christi, Texas, from the bankrupt M&G Chemicals for $1.1 billion. And last fall it inked a deal to purchase DuPont Teijin Films, which makes specialty PET and polyethylene naphthalate films.

38

SK Innovation

2017 chemical sales: $8.3 billion

SK Innovation has a knack for buying businesses from Dow Chemical. Late last year, the Korean petrochemical maker, through its SK Global Chemical subsidiary, agreed to buy the Saran polyvinylidene chloride business, a longtime Dow brand. SK had previously inked an agreement to purchase Dow's ethylene acrylic acid polymer unit to ease regulatory approval of Dow's merger with DuPont.

39

Huntsman Corp.

2017 chemical sales: $8.2 billion

Huntsman Corp. lost its founder earlier this year with the death of Jon M. Huntsman Sr. at age 80. He established Huntsman Corp. in 1982 and made its first major purchase, a Shell polystyrene plant in Belpre, Ohio, in 1983. He would go on to build one of the world's largest chemical companies through similar purchases of businesses from large firms looking to trim their portfolios. Huntsman's most important buys were Texaco Chemical and ICI's polyurethane, titanium dioxide, and petrochemical businesses. A mutiny of large Clariant shareholders prevented another milestone Huntsman deal. Last fall, Huntsman and Clariant had to cancel their merger of equals, which would have created a $14.7 billion specialty chemical powerhouse.

Air Products & Chemicals

2017 chemical sales: $8.2 billion

While industrial gas competitors such as Linde and Air Liquide have been inking big-ticket mergers, Air Products' strategy has been to crack the Chinese market. It attempted a $1.5 billion takeover of Yingde Gases, one of China's leading players, in December 2016 but lost out to the Hong Kong-based private equity firm PAG. After that, Air Products invested $500 million in a coal-to-chemicals joint venture with Lu'An Mining in Shanxi, the heart of China's coal country. It has a 60% stake in the partnership and will be responsible for the production of synthesis gas for making chemicals and fuels. Air Products made an even bigger Chinese commitment last November, signing with Yankuang Group to build a $3.5 billion coal gasification plant in Yulin, China.

Ecolab

2017 chemical sales: $8.1 billion

The strong hurricane season last year, which included Houston-pummeling Harvey, hampered Ecolab's energy, paper, and water treatment chemical business. Despite this, the company was able to score a 6% improvement in sales in 2017. Ecolab is looking to grow in chemicals. Last October, it agreed to acquire Georgia-Pacific's paper chemicals unit, which has annual sales of more than $40 million.

Westlake Chemical

2017 chemical sales: $8.0 billion

Houston-based Westlake Chemical rocketed into the Global Top 50 with its $3.8 billion purchase of rival Axiall in 2016. The deal created the second-largest polyvinyl chloride maker and the third-largest chlor-alkali player in North America. Investing in the shale gas boom, Westlake and South Korea's Lotte are building an ethylene cracker in Lake Charles, La. Westlake has also been expanding vinyl capacity in the U.S. and Europe.

Wanhua Chemical

2017 chemical sales: $7.9 billion

Anyone looking for an example of the vibrancy of the Chinese economy can cite Wanhua Chemical. The company's small methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) plant in Yantai, China, wasn't producing at full capacity until 1995. Now Wanhua is the largest producer of the polyurethane raw material in the world, ahead of Western competitors such as BASF, Covestro, Dow Chemical, and Huntsman. The company has branched into other isocyanates as well as polyols, another polyurethane raw material. With a plan to spend $1.1 billion to establish an MDI plant in Louisiana, Wanhua may bring its vibrancy to the U.S.

44

Sasol

2017 chemical sales: $7.7 billion

Early on, Sasol had headaches and delays at its massive Lake Charles, La., petrochemical project. But for the past year or more, construction has been going smoothly. As of the end of 2017, it was 81% complete, and the company had spent $8.8 billion of the $11.1 billion project budget. Sasol hopes to have the first feedstock trickling through the facility later this year. By 2022, it should be earning the company $1.3 billion a year in pre-tax profits. Separately, Gemini, a high-density polyethylene joint venture in La Porte, Texas, between Sasol and Ineos, made its first sales late last year.

Mosaic

2017 chemical sales: $7.4 billion

Mosaic is seeing its fortunes start to turn around in the slumping fertilizer industry. After a 20% drop in sales in 2016, Mosaic's turnover increased 3% last year, and profits jumped 7%. Earlier this year, the company completed the purchase of the fertilizer business of the Brazilian mining firm Vale for $2.5 billion. To get easier access to the Brazilian operations as well as its extensive Florida phosphate mine, the company is now moving its corporate headquarters from Plymouth, Minn., to Hillsborough County, Fla.

PTT Global Chemical

2017 chemical sales: $7.4 billion

PTT's project to build an ethylene cracker complex in Belmont, Ohio, gained some momentum in January when South Korea's Daelim signed on as the Thai petrochemical maker's partner. The companies are already acquiring land. They envision a 1.5 million-metric-ton-per-year cracker, which is 500,000 metric tons more than PTT originally planned when it unveiled the project in 2015. Separately, with Japan's Kuraray and Sumitomo Corp., PTT is building plants to make styrenic block copolymers and nylon 9T in Thailand.

47

Tosoh

2017 chemical sales: $7.3 billion

Tosoh shattered company records last year with a 11% increase in sales and a 17% improvement in profits. In a letter to shareholders, President Toshinori Yamamoto credited reduced debt levels, improvement in its commodity chemicals business, and strong performance in Asian markets. Tosoh, Asia's largest integrated chlor-alkali maker, is also investing heavily in specialties. In connection with this, it is renovating three of its eight laboratories to better foster innovation.

48

DIC

2017 chemical sales: $7.0 billion

DIC is keeping up with the trend of food companies shunning artificial ingredients, including color. Looking to further develop a business in natural food coloring, it invested close to $6 million in Fermentalg, a French specialist in algae for nutrition and health markets. In another biobased chemical development, DIC is partnering with the natural building block start-up Checkerspot on new polyols for coatings, inks, and other markets.

Clariant

2017 chemical sales: $6.5 billion

This may be the era of the megamerger, but one proposed deal, Clariant's combination with Huntsman, was canceled last November. Clariant and Huntsman would have combined for $14.7 billion in sales. However, Clariant investor White Tale Holdings objected to the transaction. It argued that Clariant should become more of a specialty chemical maker rather than link up with Huntsman, which has a lot of commodity chemicals in its portfolio. Earlier this year, White Tale and another major shareholder, 40 North, sold out to Saudi Arabia's SABIC, which paid $2.4 billion for a 25% stake in Clariant."

Speciality gas manufacturer Air Liquide (UK) Limited has been hit with a £182,000 court bill after workers were exposed to dangerous vapours.

The company devised an in-house system to dispose of bottles at its Tunstall depot after failing to arranging for a specialist contractor to handle the disposal.

It involved a man in a bomb disposal suit placing the bottles on to a box and two workers wearing breathing apparatus sawing through the bottles.

But on February 7, 2015 the two men using the saw were not wearing breathing apparatus when a small amount of liquid spilled out. They were left struggling to breathe and were taken to hospital but did not require treatment.

Now the company has been fined £160,000 and ordered to pay £22,611.60 prosecution costs at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court.

Prosecutor Craig Morris said the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) launched an investigation after an incident at Air Liquide’s depot at Newfields Industrial Estate, High Street, Tunstall, on February 7, 2015.

Mr Morris said: “The company developed a system for the disposal of bottles that had built up over the years. Many were heavily corroded and unmarked. Rather than arranging for a specialist contractor to handle the disposal, the defendant decided to deal with the issue in-house.

“About 50 different substances were potentially contained within the bottles.

“An employee wearing a bomb disposal suit took hold of the bottle and placed in into a box. Two other employees would operate a saw and cut through the bottle. They would move away from the area and the employee in the bomb disposal suit would take the bottle off the box and away for disposal.”

But the court heard the system worked until the two men operating the saw stopped wearing breathing apparatus.

On February 7, 2015 a small amount of liquid came out of a bottle which had just been sawn.

Mr Morris said: “One of the workers’ eyes started to sting and tingle. He could not breathe properly. His throat became tight and he was gasping. He remembered someone grabbing him. His colleague felt his eyes start to sting and he felt breathless.

“They were checked out by fire officers and went to hospital for further checks but were both released.”

The court heard the company, which made a £10.5 million pre-tax profit in 2016, has a strong health and safety record.

Mr Morris added: “People had no idea what was in the bottles. It is puzzling to the prosecution how they have stepped so far away from the basic industry guide. The removal of the breathing apparatus increased the risk.

“There were 79 bottles that had been dealt with by the time of this incident, 79 lucky dip exercises where people were exposed to risks.”

Air Liquide (UK) Limited, of Station Road, Birmingham, pleaded guilty to failing to discharge general health, safety and welfare to employees.

Bernard Thorogood, mitigating, said: “The company is here to be counted and accepts that things went wrong. The workers did not require treatment and returned to work.”

He said the business inherited about 3,500 bottles that it needed to dispose of and many were disposed of in a variety of safe ways.

“The company does not skimp in any way when it comes to safety. Very experienced men devised the process. This was a system which could have operated safely. Before the breathing apparatus were abandoned things ran safely.

“The company has safety at the heart and front of its operations and a very good record.”

Judge Paul Glenn said cutting through the bottles was like ‘Russian roulette’ because it was not known what the bottles contained.

He said: “What happened would not have happened had they all been wearing breathing apparatus. It is conceded by the company the risk assessment was not reviewed. That led to a method of working not as safe as it should have been.

“I accept the company sincerely regrets what occurred and I acknowledge the company’s excellent health and safety record. No members of the public were put at risk.”

After the hearing, a spokesman for Air Liquide UK Limited said: “The health and safety of our colleagues, customers and members of the public has always been, and remains, our foremost concern. The incident at our Tunstall site in 2015, resulted from our standards not being met and we have taken steps to prevent any recurrence. We are committed to continuously improving the procedures at our sites in order to achieve the highest safety standards in the workplace.”"

This was revealed by Georges Christol Manon (on the left), director of Mission d’aménagement et de gestion des zones industrielles (Magzi), in charge of the management of those industrial zones, in a formal notice sent to those companies.

In that notice, the director requires them to pay the loans according to the terms of their lease contract by July 31, 2018.

“We can still wait for those who own six months of loans but, starting from next year, we will have to take measures because things are very difficult for us. Truly, this is not the first time we are sending such notices. This time, because of the harms those debts constitute for us, we will cancel the contracts we have signed with those companies and they will be expelled, he said in an interview with the government daily.

According to the daily, Magzi has already canceled the contract of 24 companies while more than 60 were sent eviction notices. “Once their contracts have been canceled, they are allowed up to 6 months to destroy their building or we lease them to another client”, M. Manon explained.

Indeed, the project is divided into three lots. The first lot is the 63.5 kilometers Yaoundé-Ebebda-Kalong including the construction of a traffic intersection at carrefour-Obala. The second lot includes the renovation of the 67 kilometers Kalong-Tonga (67 km) and the third lot is for the Tonga-Bafoussam-Babadjou section (110.242 kilometers).

The ministry explains that China Railway Engineering Group CO.LTD, which was awarded the contract for the third lot “is worryingly late at less than one year of the AFCON2019”.

Due to this, the ministry chose another company for the works. In that wake, the maintenance works or the urban structure of Bafoussam-Foumbot-Foumban will be handled by ESCB Sarl which is already getting ready for the works.

Let’s note that the Yaoundé-Bafoussam-Babadjou project is part of a large programme which will extend to Bamenda, the regional capital of the Northwest. According to the government, the works should cost about CFA145 billion.

Entretien des textiles : DFD propose aux pressings et blanchisseries son CO2 supercritique - Entretien Textile,"Tue, 24 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lbnRyZXRpZW4tdGV4dGlsZS5mci9hY3R1YWxpdGUvZW50cmV0aWVuLWRlcy10ZXh0aWxlcy1kZmQtcHJvcG9zZS1hdXgtcHJlc3NpbmdzLWV0LWJsYW5jaGlzc2VyaWVzLXNvbi1jbzItc3VwZXJjcml0aXF1ZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Les contraintes réglementaires sont décidément un levier d’innovation, et c’est avec son CO2 supercritique que DFD entend proposer une nouvelle alternative à la Profession. Créé en juillet 2012, cet équipementier innovant de l’industrie 4.0 « conçoit, assemble et commercialise en France et à l’international des machines de nettoyage, dégraissage-départiculage de pièces et textiles, utilisant un procédé écologique performant à base de CO2 supercritique. »



Après avoir vendu ses cinq premières machines, DFD vient de lever un million d’euros auprès de JEREMIE Innovation 2 (conseillé par Sofimac Régions), CACF Capital Innovation, CEA Investissement et des investisseurs privés. Objectif : optimiser son process industriel et organiser son développement commercial, en France comme à l’étranger. Au-delà du marché de la mécanique de pointe, DFD vise celui de l’entretien des textiles et dispositifs médicaux implantables. « Les vertus relatives au procédé écologique maîtrisé par DFD ainsi que le bon « time to market » lié à l’abolition progressive des solvants chlorés confèrent à la société un avantage puissant sur son marché. DFD dispose ainsi d’une technologie must-have sur le marché des Cleantech et constitue l’une des rares sociétés au monde à maitriser ce procédé au niveau industriel. Quant à l’équipe, elle dispose d’un véritable savoir-faire et a su s’entourer d’experts reconnus mondialement dans le domaine du CO2 supercritique », souligne Quentin Mulaton, chargé d’affaires de Sofimac Régions.



Pour convaincre, DFD revendique un « coût d’investissement dans une machine fonctionnant au CO2 supercritique certes légèrement supérieur à celui des machines fonctionnant aux solvants classiques, mais très rapidement amorti si l’on prend en compte l'ensemble des coûts d’exploitation liés à l'utilisation de solvants chimiques, leur impossibilité à être recyclés ainsi que les améliorations de qualité de nettoyage et de process occasionnées. On constate également une baisse de consommation d’énergie pour la machine DFD de l’ordre de 50 %. »

Le nettoyage au CO2 supercritique convient pour les textiles aux salissures grasses, en remplacement des autres solvants dont le perchloroéthylène. Des essais sont en cours avec des usines industrielles du secteur.





Des arguments à faire valoir

D’après DFD, « l'utilisation du CO2 supercritique permet de traiter le textile de manière plus hygiénique et saine et de neutraliser certaines odeurs imprégnées. Sa neutralité par rapport aux tissus permet de ne pas les oxyder ni les agresser pour des actions de nettoyage. » A noter, le procédé peut aussi être utilisé pour le tannage des cuirs. « Le CO2 permet un traitement sans eau et en utilisant la quasi-totalité des agents de tannage comme le chrome ou des tannins végétaux. Ce procédé envisage de révolutionner le tannage en éliminant la totalité des rejets très polluant habituellement associés à l'industrie du tannage tout en conférant au cuir une qualité parfaite. Le tannage au CO2 SC permet également d'intégrer d'autres étapes comme la teinture et le nourrissage dans un seul et même procédé. »



La technologie en bref

DFD exploite la technologie du CO2 supercritique appliquée au dégraissage sous licence du CEA et a mis au point son procédé de nettoyage en éco-conception, en collaboration avec le CETIM et AIR LIQUIDE. Ce procédé a fait l’objet du dépôt de trois brevets. Lauréat des Trophées de l’innovation Eco-Efficacité du salon Industrie Lyon 2017, il offre aux industriels une alternative propre, sûre et efficace, sans eau ni solvant, aux traditionnels procédés lessiviels, chlorés ou pétroliers, polluants voire dangereux.



Après chauffage et mise en pression du dioxyde de carbone (au-delà 31°C et de 73 bars), le CO2atteint le domaine supercritique : un état intermédiaire, presqu’aussi dense qu’un liquide et dont les propriétés de transport (viscosité, diffusion) sont proches de celles d’un gaz. Il peut ainsi être utilisé comme un solvant apolaire permettant de remplacer ou de compléter des produits chimiques. C’est à ce solvant que seront exposées les pièces pour permettre leur nettoyage."
"Toyota Mirai : L'hydrogène, technologie du futur - Autonews","Fri, 13 Jul 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9uZXdzLmZyL2dyZWVuL2FjdHVhbGl0ZS90b3lvdGEtbWlyYWktaHlkcm9nZW5lLWh5cGUtdGF4aXMtODE3NjPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Zapping Autonews Green Fiat Topolino (2023) : autonomie, motorisation et équipement du quadricycle électrique italien

Ne jamais mettre tous ses œufs dans le même panier, tel pourrait être l'adage de Toyota. Avec la Mirai (avenir, en japonais), le constructeur automobile nippon, spécialiste de l'hybridation thermique-électrique, est en effet le premier dans le monde, à avoir produit et commercialisé en (petite) série, un véhicule pour particulier utilisant une pile à combustible à hydrogène.





De l'eau, et rien d'autre

Cette grande berline de 4,89 m, que Toyota vend depuis fin 2014 au Japon et depuis 2016 en France et qui est aujourd'hui distribuée dans 11 pays, est ainsi sans doute le véhicule à moteur le plus « propre » disponible actuellement sur le marché mondial. Rappelons à ce propos que la Toyota Mirai « zéro émission », fonctionne grâce à l’électricité produite dans la pile embarquée par réaction entre l’oxygène de l’air et l’hydrogène, et que son système ne rejette que de l'eau dans l'atmosphère.

Et si pour l'heure fort logiquement les ventes de la Mirai sont encore anonymes (Toyota a vendu 3 000 Mirai au total en 2017), le géant nippon n'a aucun doute sur sa montée en puissance graduelle. Une assertion défendue par Didier Leroy, le Vice Président de Toyota Monde : « L'hydrogène est une vraie source d'énergie pour le futur. Vous savez, chez Toyota nous travaillons sur la technologie à hydrogène depuis aussi longtemps que pour l'hybridation thermique-électrique de nos véhicules. Autrement dit, la pile à combustible à hydrogène est une technologie que nous maîtrisons. Il nous reste à convaincre une partie de la planète mais de plus en plus de pays comprennent que cette solution permet de produire de l'énergie verte, de stocker l'énergie et de développer un véhicule comme la Mirai, qui dispose de toutes les caractéristiques d'utilisation facile d'un véhicule classique. »

Une technologie qui permet à la Mirai, et ce n'est pas le moindre de ses atouts, de disposer d'une autonomie d'au moins 500 km, une valeur comparable à bon nombre de véhicules thermiques, et nettement supérieure à l'immense majorité des véhicules électriques. En outre, un véhicule hydrogène se recharge en quelques secondes, à l'instar d'un plein de carburant réalisé sur un véhicule thermique.

La dernière livraison de berlines Mirai en France a été effectuée à la compagnie de taxis Hype ce jeudi 12 juillet à La Défense, près de Paris. Elle constitue un véritable tournant pour Hype, qui s’appuie désormais sur une flotte de 100 voitures à pile à combustible hydrogène, la plus grande de France à « Zéro Émission ».

Abdou, chauffeur expérimenté d'une Mirai au sein de l'entreprise Hype, nous parle justement de son quotidien au volant de sa berline : « Chez Hype, nous croyons dans la voiture électrique à hydrogène. Pour nous les chauffeurs, il s'agit de la réponse appropriée à la problématique de la pollution en ville. De surcroît, la Toyota Mirai nous donne l'autonomie dont nous avons besoin et nous permet de faire le plein en quelques minutes. En outre, et c'est loin d'être négligeable, cette berline offre un confort de conduite tout en souplesse et un agrément à nul autre pareil. »

Toyota va continuer de développer la visibilité et la production de la Mirai, ambitionnant de passer à 30 000 exemplaires par an dans le monde, tout en multipliant par dix ses capacités de production. Notamment à l'approche des Jeux Olympiques d'été de 2020, qui se dérouleront à Tokyo, une vitrine idéale. Didier Leroy confirme : « Bien sûr, les JO de Tokyo seront une excellente opportunité. Par ailleurs, nous sommes aussi convaincus qu'à horizon 2023-2025, il y aura naturellement une énorme progression de cette technologie sur l'ensemble de la planète. Il est inconcevable que cette technologie ne devienne pas l'élément majeur de la mobilité de demain. »

Mais avant de devenir un enjeu incontournable aux quatre coins du Globe, Toyota inscrit sa stratégie de l'hydrogène aux plans nationaux. Dont la France, avec la livraison de sa Mirai à des flottes d'entreprises. Parmi lesquelles figure, on l'a dit, la compagnie de taxis à hydrogène Hype.

Mathieu Gardies, le fondateur de Hype, n'est pas peu fier de rappeler quelques éléments-clefs de sa compagnie : « Hype est la première compagnie de taxis française dans le monde, dont la flotte est exclusivement composée de véhicules à hydrogène, donc non polluants. Notre flotte comprend aujourd'hui 38 Toyota Mirai et l'objectif de la société est de disposer au total de 200 voitures de ce type fin 2018, et de 600 fin 2020. Enfin, dès 2021, le but est de proposer notre offre à tous les opérateurs de la mobilité à Paris et dans d'autres villes de l'Hexagone. »

Alliance fondamentale

La clef de voûte du développement de cette technologie, réside forcément dans la filière d'installation et de distribution de l'hydrogène. En France, elle est assurée par le Groupe Air Liquide. Pierre-Etienne Franc, en charge de l'activité Hydrogène-Energie chez Air Liquide, en a profité ce jeudi, pour rappeler les raisons pour lesquelles son entreprise est un maillon fondamental du développement des véhicules à hydrogène dans notre pays: « L'hydrogène est notre métier depuis 40 ans. Nous sommes là pour accompagner ce gaz, le conditionner et le distribuer dans des stations que nous fabriquons également. Ainsi, nous assurons la croissance de ce réseau en France, et ailleurs dans le monde. Et, concernant l'Hexagone, en particulier à Paris pour participer à la montée en puissance de ces taxis de la capitale et faire grandir le réseau. »

Lors de ce « green day » à la Défense, Didier Gambart, le PDG de Toyota France, insistait pour sa part sur l'inscription de Toyota France et de ses partenaires sur le long terme en matière d'hydrogène embarqué en automobile : « Cette nouvelle livraison de Mirai s’inscrit dans le cadre du Toyota Challenge Environnemental 2050, et marque la poursuite d’une relation de partenariat dans la durée avec Hype et Air Liquide. Cette journée illustre aussi notre engagement commun autour de la promotion de la société hydrogène. Nous sommes ainsi dans la droite ligne des objectifs du Plan National Hydrogène annoncé par Nicolas Hulot le 1er juin dernier. »

Vous l'aurez compris, le développement rapide de la voiture à hydrogène est également la résultante d'une volonté politique des dirigeants de chaque pays. Une volonté que Toyota porte déjà en bandoulière...
