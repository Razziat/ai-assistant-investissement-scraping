Air Liquide and TotalEnergies partner to develop low-carbon hydrogen production in the Normandy industrial basin - Air Liquide,"Tue, 14 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5haXJsaXF1aWRlLmNvbS9ncm91cC9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy1uZXdzLzIwMjEtMDktMTQvYWlyLWxpcXVpZGUtYW5kLXRvdGFsZW5lcmdpZXMtcGFydG5lci1kZXZlbG9wLWxvdy1jYXJib24taHlkcm9nZW4tcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1ub3JtYW5keS1pbmR1c3RyaWFs0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide and TotalEnergies are joining forces to decarbonize hydrogen production at TotalEnergies’ Normandy platform in France. This project will enable in time the supply to TotalEnergies by Air Liquide of low-carbon hydrogen by relying on Air Liquide's hydrogen network in Normandy and the implementation of a large-scale CO2 capture and storage solution (CCS). In line with the objective of both companies’ to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, this ambitious project is part of a sustainable development approach which will help develop a low-carbon hydrogen ecosystem in the “Axe Seine/Normandy”, progressively supported by technologies such as CCS and electrolysis.

Reducing Carbon Emissions

Under a long term contract agreement, Air Liquide will take over and operate the 255 tons-per-day hydrogen production unit at the TotalEnergies platform in Normandy. Connecting the unit to Air Liquide’s hydrogen network will enable to optimize its performance and, ultimately, develop the world’s first low-carbon hydrogen network. The network already includes a hydrogen production facility in Port-Jérôme equipped with Air Liquide’s CryocapTM carbon capture solution since 2015. Air Liquide is considering adding a large-scale unit to produce renewable hydrogen via electrolysis.

In addition, the companies will launch development studies to deploy a carbon capture and storage (CCS) project to decarbonize the hydrogen produced in this unit at the Normandy platform. Air Liquide would install its Cryocap™ process to capture CO2, while TotalEnergies would handle transportation and storage of the captured CO2, notably through the Northern Lights (Norway) and Aramis (Netherlands) CCS projects being developed in the North Sea.

In the long term, the implementation of these projects would reduce the carbon emissions from the unit’s hydrogen production by approximately 650,000 tons of CO2 per year by 2030.

Decarbonizing the Normandy Industrial Basin

This cooperation between Air Liquide and TotalEnergies is aligned with their shared ambition to help decarbonize industrial operations in the “Axe Seine/Normandy”. Along with other industrial companies, the partners signed a Memorandum of Understanding announced in July 2021, to develop carbon capture and storage infrastructure in Normandy with the goal of reducing CO2 emissions by up to 3 million tons per year by 2030.

François Jackow, Executive Vice President and a Member of the Air Liquide Group’s Executive Committee supervising Europe Industries activities, said:

“Decarbonizing industry is a major challenge. The large range of solutions we have developed enable us to support our customers in their path towards energy transition. We have worked with TotalEnergies for many years, and are pleased to strengthen our partnership today with the deployment of solutions that will provide the Normandy industrial basin with a low-carbon hydrogen network in the years ahead. In line with our objective to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, Air Liquide is acting now to develop low-carbon and renewable hydrogen production and build a more sustainable future.”

Bernard Pinatel, President, Refining & Chemicals and Member of the Executive Committee of TotalEnergies, said:

“This planned investment at our Normandy platform will enhance its industrial competitiveness and secure its long-term future. We are delighted to partner with Air Liquide on low-carbon hydrogen projects so we can work together on reducing the carbon emissions from our industrial operations. These projects contribute to the collective effort launched in the Le Havre industrial zone and the Seine corridor. This is fully aligned with TotalEnergies’ ambition to get to net zero emissions by 2050.”

Under French law, the proposed transfer of the hydrogen production unit to Air Liquide is subject to the process for notifying and consulting employee representatives of the TotalEnergies Normandy platform, and to the approval from the competent authorities."

Posted: 22 September 2021 | International Airport Review |

Airbus, Air Liquide and VINCI Airports, who are all important players in the aviation, hydrogen, and airport industries, have signed a partnership to promote a hydrogen future for aircraft.

Airbus, Air Liquide and VINCI Airports, three major players in the aviation, hydrogen and airport industries, are working together to promote the use of hydrogen at airports and build the EU airport network to accommodate future hydrogen aircrafts. The airport of Lyon-Saint Exupéry (LYS) will host the first installations as early as 2023. This partnership reflects the three groups’ shared ambition to combine their respective expertise to support the decarbonisation of air travel.

Lyon-Saint Exupéry Airport, VINCI Airports’ centre of excellence for innovation, has been chosen as the pilot airport by the partners. The implementation of this project includes several phases:

From 2023: deployment of a hydrogen gas distribution station at Lyon-Saint Exupéry Airport. This station will supply both the airport’s ground vehicles (airside buses, trucks, handling equipment, etc.) and those of its partners, as well as the heavy goods vehicles that drive around the airport. This first phase is essential to test the airport’s facilities and dynamics as a ‘hydrogen hub’ in its area of reach.

Between 2023 and 2030: deployment of liquid hydrogen infrastructures that will allow hydrogen to be provisioned into the tanks of future aircraft.

Beyond 2030: deployment of the hydrogen infrastructure from production to mass distribution of liquid hydrogen at the airport.

By 2030, the three partners will study the possibility of equipping VINCI Airports’ EU airport network with the hydrogen production, storage and supply facilities needed for use on the ground and on board aircraft.

This partnership illustrates the partners’ shared commitment to decarbonising air travel and is a major step forward for the development of hydrogen across the airport ecosystem. It relies on the know-how of Airbus in commercial aircraft, on Air Liquide‘s expertise in mastering the entire hydrogen value chain (production, liquefaction, storage and distribution) and on the global reach of VINCI Airports, the leading private airport operator with 45 airports in 12 countries, which will help create the desired network."

Airbus forges ahead with zero-emission aviation | electrive.com - www.electrive.com,"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsZWN0cml2ZS5jb20vMjAyMS8wOS8yMi9haXJidXMtZm9yZ2VzLWFoZWFkLXdpdGgtemVyby1lbWlzc2lvbi1hdmlhdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has just unveiled concrete plans for zero-emission aviation with a new generation of the battery-electric CityAirbus. Meanwhile, the aircraft manufacturer has signed an MoU with Air New Zealand to research hydrogen-fuelled aircraft, while in Europe Airbus will focus on hydrogen aviation infrastructure with Air Liquide and airport operator Vinci by 2030.

Firstly to the battery-electric aircraft that Airbus first announced in March 2019 when Audi and Airbus presented the aircraft developed as part of the Urban Air Mobility project in the Audi town of Ingolstadt in Germany. Equipped with eight electrically powered propellers, the CityAirbus NextGen aircraft will be able to carry four passengers around 80 kilometres and at speeds of up to 120 km/h. The first flight of the prototype is planned for 2023, with certification around 2025.

Airbus calls the battery-electric aircraft a “flying taxi” capable of silently flying over urban spaces. The body of the eVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing) aircraft features a V-shaped tail and fixed wings, its propulsion system is made up of eight electrically powered propellers. A key feature of the plane is noise reduction functions which the company says features sound levels less than 65 dBa during fly-overs and below 70 dBa during landing.

With this aircraft, Airbus Helicopters CEO Bruno Eve explains: “We are on a quest to co-create an entirely new market that sustainably integrates urban air mobility into the cities while addressing environmental and social concerns. Airbus is convinced that the real challenges are as much about urban integration, public acceptance, and automated air traffic management, as about vehicle technology and business models.”

However, before aviation for more than a few passengers becomes emission-free there are a few physical hurdles to overcome. Aviation has been identified as a key focal point for the hydrogen strategies of the USA and Germany, among other “hard-to-decarbonise” sectors such as long-haul shipping. Because of the weight of batteries, purely battery-electric aircraft are generally limited to small passenger planes. Hydrogen-powered aircraft have the benefit of the greater energy density capacity of hydrogen fuel. Here, along with its concrete plans for hydrogen aircraft, Airbus is already planning hydrogen infrastructure at airports making its first investigations into the hydrogen aircraft outlook with airlines.

In New Zealand this week, Airbus and Air New Zealand announced a joint initiative to research the ways in which hydrogen-powered aircraft could assist the airline with reaching its goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. Needless to say, many of New Zealand’s industries are dependent on long-distance travel to and from the geographically isolated island-state near the southern-most end of the Pacific ocean.

The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) lays the groundwork for Air New Zealand to analyse the impact that hydrogen aircraft may have on its network, operations and infrastructure. For its part, Airbus will provide the hydrogen aircraft “performance requirements and ground operations characteristics” in order to support the New Zealand airline in developing its decarbonisation roadmap.

Meanwhile, over in Europe, Airbus has just now joined forces with the gas manufacturer Air Liquide and the airport operator Vinci to create the necessary infrastructure for the refuelling of future hydrogen aircraft by 2030.

The first step will be taken at Lyon-Saint Exupéry Airport, where a hydrogen station for trucks and buses is to be built from 2023. In the years thereafter, the partners want to develop the infrastructure for refuelling aircraft with liquid hydrogen.

The project includes three main phases. From 2023 the three companies envisage the deployment of a hydrogen gas distribution station at Lyon-Saint Exupéry airport. This station is supposed to supply both the airport’s ground vehicles (buses, trucks, handling equipment, etc.) and those of its partners, as well as the heavy goods vehicles that drive around the airport. The partners say that this first phase is essential to test the airport’s facilities and dynamics as a “hydrogen hub” in its area of reach.

To underline the forethought and strategy in these plans, it should perhaps be noted that in June this year, Airbus was granted support from the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Technology (BMWI) and the German Federal Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure (BMVI). In June this year, the German government ministries selected 62 major projects to receive government funding as part of a joint European hydrogen project (Hydrogen IPCEI), funding twelve projects in the mobility sector. Airbus was named in connection with hydrogen-powered intralogistics vehicles.

In the second main phase, between 2023 and 2030, Airbus, Air Liquide and the airport operator Vinci will be working on the deployment of liquid hydrogen infrastructures. Airbus says that this will allow hydrogen to be provisioned into the tanks of future aircraft.

In the last phase, beyond 2030 the partners will focus on the deployment of hydrogen infrastructure from production to mass distribution of liquid hydrogen at the airport. Beyond these concrete phases, the partners will be looking at the possibility of equipping Vinci Airports’ European airport network with hydrogen production, storage and supply facilities. This should be utilised for both ground vehicles as well as aircraft. Vinci Airports manages 45 airports in 12 countries in Europe, Asia and the Americas.

Airbus is now building on considerable investment in hydrogen-powered aeroplanes. In January this year, Airbus unveiled a new configuration as part of its ZEROe programme that could enable passenger aircraft to fly further than ever before with zero emissions. The so-called ‘pod configuration’ consists of six detachable fuel cell propeller propulsion systems mounted under the wings. In September last year, Airbus had given details of new hydrogen-powered aircraft studies. The aircraft manufacturer unveiled three concepts for the world’s first zero-emission commercial aircraft that could enter service by 2035. All of these concepts, code-named ZEROe, rely on hydrogen as the main energy source, but each takes a different approach. In October 2020, Airbus also launched a fuel cell aircraft partnership with ElringKlinger.

Most recently, in June this year, Airbus announced that it was gathering its efforts for metallic hydrogen tanks and establish so-called Zero-Emission Development Centres (ZEDC) at sites in Bremen, Germany and Nantes in France. The goal of the ZEDCs is to enable the cost-effective production of cryogenic tanks to support the future market launch of the ZEROe concept as well as to accelerate the development of hydrogen propulsion technologies.

This 27-week program will help 26 students gain a much-needed vocational qualification and enter the workforce with confidence. Sci-Bono’s Anele Davids, Director, and Zelda Fynn, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Manager, tell us more about this program and partnership.

What does the Sci-Bono Discovery Centre do?

Anele: Sci-Bono’s purpose is to become a vehicle for all manner of disadvantaged people to receive education in math, science and technology. Sci-Bono offers innovative, dynamic learning experiences that help build South Africa’s science, engineering and technology capacities.







Zelda: The Sci-Bono Discovery Centre is always buzzing with fun learning activities enjoyed by a wide scope of visitors, including families, companies, school learners, teachers and the general public. Sci-Bono aims to promote awareness, understanding and interest in the sciences, engineering and technology through exposure to more than 300 interactive exhibits, shows, programs, events and activities.

Why have you launched this IT training program?

Anele: Our project, supported by the Air Liquide Foundation, aims to provide bright, hard-working young people from disadvantaged backgrounds with an opportunity to participate in the IT industry as employees or entrepreneurs, or a platform to launch their further education. We’ve started the program with 26 young people (14 boys and 12 girls), who went through a rigorous selection process to ensure motivated, driven candidates with an interest in an IT career. Simplon.co representatives led this process, which required candidates to complete an online systems development challenge, submit a letter describing why they wanted to be part of the program, and participate in an online interview conducted by Sci-Bono and Simplon.co (A network of socially-conscious digital factories / network of social digital factories that offer free, intensive courses in digital professions in France and abroad) representatives.







Zelda: The ICT Learnership aims to address the problem of unemployment and poor schooling in South Africa by providing practical skills, qualifications and experience. Students are prepared for employment through exposure to a high-pressure, fast-paced learning environment, a strong mentorship program and a month-long internship to ensure they can apply their new skills.

How’s it going?

Anele: The training program is focused on problem-solving projects using information and communication technology (ICT) as a platform. So far, we’ve had 100% commitment from all 26 learners, who are enjoying working independently while collaborating with their peers as and when they deem necessary. This is teaching our youths hard work while preparing them for the workplace. Currently, a few girls are working on a project to develop a website for a small hotel owner. We’re looking forward to the outcomes and I hope their first real client is happy with their endeavors.







Zelda: The program follows the Simplon.co methodology of active pedagogy that puts learners at the center of their learning, requiring their active participation as they research, explore, experiment and collaborate in their search for solutions. Learners develop skills applicable to real-life situations because they’re actively engaged in learning. At Sci-Bono, our learners found this methodology overwhelming at first because it was new to them, but they’ve risen to the challenge and can now see the benefits."

Airbus three-way partnership to test hydrogen distribution at Lyon airport - Flightglobal,"Tue, 21 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mbGlnaHRnbG9iYWwuY29tL2Fpci10cmFuc3BvcnQvYWlyYnVzLXRocmVlLXdheS1wYXJ0bmVyc2hpcC10by10ZXN0LWh5ZHJvZ2VuLWRpc3RyaWJ1dGlvbi1hdC1seW9uLWFpcnBvcnQvMTQ1NTU5LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus and airports operator Vinci are participating in a partnership to promote the introduction and use of hydrogen in the aviation sector, including possible initial installation of systems at Lyon airport in the next two years.

The two companies will join with industrial gas technology specialist Air Liquide in the decarbonisation partnership to promote development of European airport networks to support future hydrogen-powered aircraft.

Lyon-Saint Exupery airport has been selected as an initial pilot airport for a hydrogen gas distribution station, which will fuel ground vehicles – including buses and ground-handling equipment – from around 2023.

“This first phase is essential to test the airport’s facilities and dynamics as a ‘hydrogen hub’ in its area of reach,” the partners state.

Over the subsequent few years, liquid hydrogen infrastructure enabling hydrogen to be supplied to aircraft tanks will be deployed, with a view to shifting to production and mass distribution from 2030 onwards.

The partnership will examine, by the end of the current decade, the potential for installing hydrogen production, storage and supply infrastructure – for vehicles and aircraft – across the Vinci Airports network in Europe.

Airbus has been working on various conceptual designs for hydrogen-fuelled aircraft and believes such aircraft could enter service around 2035.

“This partnership illustrates the partners’ shared commitment to decarbonising air travel and is a major step forward for the development of hydrogen across the airport eco-system,” the companies add."
Saras and Air Liquide agreement for the zero-emission refinery - breakinglatest.news,"Fri, 17 Sep 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyZWFraW5nbGF0ZXN0Lm5ld3MvYnVzaW5lc3Mvc2FyYXMtYW5kLWFpci1saXF1aWRlLWFncmVlbWVudC1mb3ItdGhlLXplcm8tZW1pc3Npb24tcmVmaW5lcnkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The goal is the zero-emission refinery. The starting point is a project that provides for the capture and storage of CO2 underground and an agreement between two large groups: Saras and Air Liquide. At the Saras refinery in Sarroch, about twenty kilometers from Cagliari, we are looking at decarbonisation and new solutions to proceed with the abatement of emissions.

The agreement

Precisely with this in mind, the oil company (founded by Angelo Moratti in 1962 and considered one of the main European operators in the energy and oil refining sector) has signed with Air Liquid (present in 78 countries with approximately 64,500 employees, 3.8 million customers and patients and operating in the field of gases, technologies and services for Industry and Health,) a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) aimed at “exploring opportunities to reduce the footprint of carbon from the Sarroch refinery ». Starting from the agreement, the two companies will assess the economic and technical feasibility for the capture and storage of CO2 emissions related to the Sarroch refinery processes. “Supporting the decarbonisation of the industry is one of the strategic pillars of the Air Liquide Group, which is committed to addressing the urgency of climate change and the challenge of the energy transition, aiming to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050”.

The two phases of the memorandum

The Memorandum provides, in a first phase, “a study aimed at considering various carbon capture solutions, including the solution conceived and patented by Air Liquide CryocapTM, and their applicability”. In a second phase, the two partners plan “to carry out a more in-depth feasibility study that will also include CO2 transport and storage solutions”. Solutions that, according to experts, would allow a “reduction of the carbon footprint of the refinery and of the supply of electricity to the surrounding community”. The program also benefits from the presence, at the Sardinian industrial site of an Igcc (Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle) plant, an integrated combined cycle plant that uses heavy products from the refinery to produce electricity destined to supply industries and homes in Sardinia.

The horizon of the transition

For Dario Scaffardi, CEO of Saras (the company has 1,690 employees and has revenues of approximately € 5.3 billion at 31 December 2020), this is an “important step in Saras’ commitment to face the challenge of transition energy guaranteeing the sustainability of our production site in the medium to long term “.

An avant-garde technology

«The capture and storage of CO2 is a cutting-edge technology with significant potential and is recognized as a fundamental technology for achieving the goal of climate neutrality – adds the CEO -. Air Liquide has been one of Saras’ main suppliers for decades. We are pleased and proud to develop this study with a partner of excellence, with extensive and recognized experience, and who has already developed important similar projects, in the certainty that this collaboration will help define solutions to effectively address the challenges for the sustainable development of our Group”."
