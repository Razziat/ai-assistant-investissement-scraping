Renewable hydrogen is still far less competitive than fossil fuels

“To make green hydrogen competitive, we need serially produced, low-cost, scalable electrolyzers,” said Christian Bruch, CEO and President of Siemens Energy. According to a study published last year, clean hydrogen is still far less cost-effective than fossil fuels.

European electrolyzer makers have pledged to boost capacity tenfold by 2025

European electrolyzer manufacturers recently signed a joint declaration committing to a tenfold increase in capacity by 2025 to meet the European Union’s (EU) clean hydrogen goals, while the European Commission vowed to facilitate financing and accelerate the permitting process. This is expected to enable the EU to produce 10 million tons of renewable hydrogen a year by 2030.

Romania’s Hydroelectrica recently invited bids for producing a feasibility study for a 100 MW green hydrogen plant which would use water from the Olt river.

Siemens Energy-Air Liquide electrolysis modules will be suited to harvest volatile renewable energy

The Siemens Energy-Air Liquide factory for electrolysis modules (“stacks”), located in Berlin, will supply both companies for their customers and the rapidly growing market. Based on proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis technology, these stacks will feature a high degree of efficiency and are ideally suited to harvest volatile renewable energy, according to the press release.

One of the first electrolyzer projects is Air Liquide’s Normand’Hy, in the French region of Normandy, with a capacity of 200 MW expected in the first phase. The assembly of the electrolyzer systems for this project is planned to be done in France, according to the press release."
Diabetes: helping reinvent the care pathway to make patients’ lives easier - Air Liquide,"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvaGVhbHRoY2FyZS9kaWFiZXRlcy1oZWxwaW5nLXJlaW52ZW50LWNhcmUtcGF0aHdheS1tYWtlLXBhdGllbnRzLWxpdmVzLWVhc2llctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide Healthcare is the leading European player in care for patients with diabetes, aiming to improve their quality of life and manage their condition through new tools, innovative technologies and a continuous reflection process for personalized continuum of care. This unique approach, focused on individual patients and their needs, helps lessen the daily burden of their condition.

Diabetes is characterized by excess sugar in the blood (hyperglycemia) and can be divided into two main types: type 1, in which the pancreas produces no insulin, and the more common type 2, which can develop gradually due to a sedentary lifestyle and an excessively rich diet. However, worldwide, there are 537 million adults living with diabetes 1 , each with a different daily way of life characterized by treatment, monitoring blood glucose, following specially adapted diets, physical exercise, etc. Diabetes is a chronic disease that requires controlling blood sugar levels to prevent complications in small blood vessels. It affects the nerves, retina and kidneys. Large blood vessels can also be affected by diabetes, potentially leading to myocardial infarction (heart attack), strokes or lower-limb disorders.

These are preventable complications but ones which unfortunately remain frequent, representing 75% of diabetes-related healthcare expenditure in Europe! 1 This figure underlines the continued need for greater coordination and discussion among all stakeholders: diabetologists in the community and in hospitals and other specialists, general practitioners, nurses and paramedics, device manufacturers, healthcare providers, patients and their families, charities, and the list goes on. For example, continuous glucose monitors, insulin pumps and all the research relating to data and artificial intelligence can enable a large portion of continuous insulin therapy to be automated, thus making the daily lives of patients easier.

However, as Samuel Chevalier, Head of Air Liquide Healthcare’s Diabetes Program, explains, ""these innovations can only yield the expected results when accompanied by personalized support whenever necessary. Medical devices must adapt to the daily lives of patients, not the other way around. They must also facilitate the work of caregivers, who require training to familiarize themselves with these new tools. And of course, let us not forget the need for the healthcare system to evolve and encourage the introduction of new continua of care based around these devices.""

In addition to its support for the most promising projects and its key role in access to innovation, Air Liquide Healthcare’s commitment to patients puts it in a strong position to help improve their adherence and motivation. ""In order to have an effective impact"" underlines Samuel Chevalier, ""it is important to understand patients in all their diversity. Certain have a disease that is under control, others do not. Their relationship with caregivers is not the same, neither is their appetite for digital tools. Without forgetting, of course, their social background."" Air Liquide offers a variety of tools to help people manage diabetes on a daily basis, ranging from patient workshops to dedicated IT platforms, access to experts and training for medical devices, encouraging patient empowerment at all times. Its French subsidiary Dinno Santé, for example, in partnership with the charity Aide aux Jeunes Diabétiques, has launched an application that uses gamification to help children between the ages of 8 and 12 better understand diabetes.

A new approach to care

By providing each patient with a tailored response, Air Liquide Healthcare has based its approach on the value of healthcare. ""Currently, all diabetics in Europe have appointments with their caregivers at similar intervals. However, identifying the individual needs of each patient and offering made-to-measure care would allow us as well as doctors to spend more time on high-risk cases and prevent more complications,"" highlights Samuel Chevalier. ""By making use of the data that we have access to, we can build a personalized care plan with each patient."" This approach to care improves their adherence to treatment, reduces the risk of complications and hospitalization and, most importantly, helps diabetics live with their condition better. This integrated approach also drives the potential for major savings in terms of time and efficiency for healthcare professionals as well as financial savings for the healthcare system."

Lime is among the hard-to-abate industries as the decomposition of limestone generates CO 2 . Thanks to the project, the site in Réty – which is the largest in France – would be able to reduce emissions by over 600,000 tons per year starting in 2028, or the equivalent of 55,000 French households.

“Decarbonizing the Industry is at the heart of Air Liquide’s strategy and we are committed to accompanying our customers with a wide range of solutions, in line with our Sustainability Development objectives,” said Pascal Vinet, Senior Vice President, a member of the Air Liquide Executive Committee, supervising Europe Industries.

Using its innovative CryocapTM FG (Flue Gas) technology, Air Liquide will build and employ a unit that can capture and purify 95% of Réty’s CO 2 emissions. This will be the first time using CryocapTM for lime production decarbonization in the country.

Once the carbon dioxide is captured, it will be transported to a multimodal CO 2 export hub in Dunkirk that is currently in the making, and then sent to the North Sea as part of the D’Artagnan project, which the European Commission has labeled PCI (Project of Common Interest).

“As a leader in the lime industry, we are very proud that for the first time, a lime plant will capture its CO 2 emissions and store them in safe conditions,” said Cedric De Vicq, Lhoist CEO Europe.

If the electricity used in this process comes from a renewable source then some call it ""green"" hydrogen.

Siemens Energy and Air Liquide have announced plans to set up a joint venture focused on the production of ""industrial scale renewable hydrogen electrolyzers in Europe.""

The move, announced on Thursday, represents the latest attempt to find a way to drive ""renewable"" or ""green"" hydrogen production costs down and make the sector competitive.

The establishment of the joint venture — Siemens Energy will have a 74.9% stake, while Air Liquide will hold 25.1% — is subject to approval from authorities.

If all goes to plan, its headquarters will be in Berlin, with a facility producing electrolysis modules, or stacks, also based there.

Plans for electrolyzer production in the German capital had been previously announced. Manufacturing is set to begin in 2023, with a yearly production capacity of 3 gigawatts reached in 2025.

The European Union's executive arm, the European Commission, has previously said it wants 40 GW of renewable hydrogen electrolyzers to be installed in the EU in 2030.

Air Liquide and Lhoist join forces to launch a new decarbonisation project for French lime production - World Cement,"Thu, 30 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFodHRwczovL3d3dy53b3JsZGNlbWVudC5jb20vZXVyb3BlLWNpcy8zMDA2MjAyMi9haXItbGlxdWlkZS1hbmQtbGhvaXN0LWpvaW4tZm9yY2VzLXRvLWxhdW5jaC1hLWZpcnN0LW9mLWl0cy1raW5kLWRlY2FyYm9uaXNhdGlvbi1wcm9qZWN0LW9mLWxpbWUtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1pbi1mcmFuY2Uv0gGqAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndvcmxkY2VtZW50LmNvbS9ldXJvcGUtY2lzLzMwMDYyMDIyL2Fpci1saXF1aWRlLWFuZC1saG9pc3Qtam9pbi1mb3JjZXMtdG8tbGF1bmNoLWEtZmlyc3Qtb2YtaXRzLWtpbmQtZGVjYXJib25pc2F0aW9uLXByb2plY3Qtb2YtbGltZS1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLWluLWZyYW5jZS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide and Lhoist have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the aim to decarbonise Lhoist’s lime production plant located in Réty, in the Hauts-de-France region, using Air Liquide’s innovative and proprietary CryocapTM carbon capture technology. In this context, Air Liquide and Lhoist have jointly applied for the European Innovation Fund large scale support scheme. This partnership is a new step in the creation of a low-carbon industrial ecosystem in the broader Dunkirk area.

Lime is one of the “hard-to-abate” industries as its production primarily generates CO 2 from decomposition of limestone. The “Chaux et Dolomies du Boulonnais” Lhoist’s site in Réty is France’s largest lime production plant. Thanks to this project, Lhoist would be able to reduce the CO 2 emissions of the plant in Réty by more than 600 000 tpy starting in 2028. This is equivalent to the annual emissions of about 55 000 households in France.

Leveraging its know-how and unique expertise in CO 2 capture technologies, Air Liquide would build and operate a unit of its innovative and proprietary CryocapTM FG (Flue Gas) technology to capture and purify 95% of the CO 2 arising from Lhoist’s existing lime production unit in Réty. Air Liquide’s CryocapTM technology would thus be used for the first time to decarbonise lime production in France.

The captured CO 2 would then be transported to a multimodal CO 2 export hub[1] in Dunkirk, currently under development, and sent to be sequestered in the North Sea as part of the D’Artagnan project, which has received the PCI (Project of Common Interest) label from the European Commission.

The implementation of the project will be possible as public funding from European and/or French schemes supporting decarbonisation become available. In this perspective, Air Liquide and Lhoist have jointly applied for the European Innovation Fund large scale call.

Pascal Vinet, Senior Vice President, a member of the Air Liquide Executive Committee, supervising Europe Industries, said :

“Decarbonising the Industry is at the heart of Air Liquide’s strategy and we are committed to accompanying our customers with a wide range of solutions, in line with our Sustainability Development objectives. Using CryocapTM to decarbonise lime production demonstrates the versatility of our innovative and proprietary carbon capture technology. Our partnership with Lhoist will contribute to the decarbonisation of the broader Dunkirk industrial basin, one of Air Liquide's historical industrial basins in France.""

Cedric De Vicq, Lhoist CEO Europe, said:

“As a leader in the lime industry, we are very proud that for the first time, a lime plant will capture its CO 2 emissions and store them in safe conditions. Carbon Capture & Storage is an indispensable part of how the lime industry addresses the reduction of its CO 2 footprint for the benefit of the environment and its customers.”"

SK Gas Co., a South Korean major liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) provider, and Korean chemicals firm Lotte Chemical Corp. are slated to set up a joint venture for by-product hydrogen power and hydrogen for transport. On Thursday, the two firms and global industrial gas supplier Air Liquide Korea signed an agreement for the JV establishment in Seoul.SK Gas and Lotte Chemical have accelerated the launch of the JV since the two firms signed a memorandum of understanding for a hydrogen business partnership in May 2021.Air Liquide Korea, the Korean unit of French company Air Liquide SA, also signed an MOU with Lotte Chemical to enter the hydrogen mobility market last month. At the time, Lotte Chemical said it will spend 210 billion won ($167.8 million) to build facilities for ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC), two organic compounds used in electrolytes, which is a key material for EV batteries.SK Gas, Lotte Chemical and Air Liquide Korea will respectively hold 45%, 45% and 10% stakes in the JV, and SK Gas and Lotte Chemical will jointly manage the venture. SK Gas said the JV will be founded in the third quarter of this year, after receiving approval from Korea’s antitrust watchdog the Fair Trade Commission.The JV’s first project will be the construction of a hydrogen fuel cell power plant to begin operations in the second half of 2024 in Ulsan, a port city in southern South Korea, to secure by-product hydrogen. By-product hydrogen is generated by refining the mixture gas with a high concentration of hydrogen coming from some electrochemical processes. The product is increasingly used for fuel cell power.The plant’s power production capacity will reach 500,000 megawatt-hours (MWh) per year, an amount that covers 120,000 four-person households a year. The venture will also build hydrogen fueling stations across Korea and seek collaboration in the production of blue and green hydrogen, both regarded as clean energy sources.For the projects, SK Gas will supply by-product hydrogen generated from its Ulsan-based affiliates. The LPG provider will also lead the JV’s long-term growth given its experience in power generation and LPG charger network operation.Lotte Chemical, the largest producer of the by-product hydrogen in Korea, will provide sites in its Ulsan-based plant as well as raw materials. The chemicals firm is making efforts to secure clients via its Lotte Group affiliates.Air Liquide Korea will offer in-depth knowledge and technologies for hydrogen supply and distribution chains and fueling stations.“We hope that the JV will serve as a stepping stone for vitalizing the hydrogen economy in Korea and contribute to the country’s transition to the hydrogen economy,” said Yoon Byung-suk, CEO of SK Gas.“It is meaningful to converge the three companies’ core capabilities to form the foundation of the early stage hydrogen ecosystem,” said Hwang Jin-goo, resident of Lotte Chemical’s basic materials business division.Air Liquide Korea President Nicolas Foirien said, “The partnership will contribute to the sustainable development of Korea’s hydrogen economy, as well as align with the Air Liquide Group’s climate strategy.”Kyung-Min Kang at kkm1026@hankyung.com Jihyun Kim edited this article."

This PPA comes in addition to a previous agreement announced with Vattenfall in March 2021, expanding the long-term partnership between the two groups. It reaffirms Air Liquide's commitment to lead the way in decarbonizing the European industry while lowering its own carbon footprint, in line with its Sustainable Development objectives.

Air Liquide has signed a 15 year contract starting in 2025 with Vattenfall, one of Europe’s leading producers and retailers of electricity. The renewable energy will be generated by the Hollandse Kust Zuid (HKZ) subsidy-free, worldscale offshore wind farm under construction by Vattenfall off the Dutch coast.

It will also feed some of its large-scale decarbonization projects in the region and accompany the acceleration of its customers’ demand growth for low-carbon gases. This agreement will allow Air Liquide to cover more than 30% of the Group's current electricity consumption in the Benelux.





Over the contract duration, this will avoid the emission of up to 3.5 million tonnes of CO2, which is comparable to the emissions generated by over 150,000 Dutch households. This contract will significantly expand Air Liquide's offer of low-carbon solutions at competitive prices and give customers the ability to add more renewable content in their end products.

Liquide Opens Las Vegas Facility To Meet Rising Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles Demand - H2 News - Hydrogen News - Green Hydrogen Report,"Thu, 09 Jun 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmh5ZHJvZ2VuZnVlbG5ld3MuY29tL2h5ZHJvZ2VuLWZ1ZWwtY2VsbC12ZWhpY2xlcy1sdi84NTUzMDA0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The liquid H2 production plant will also include a logistics center serving the mobility sector.

Air Liquide has announced the opining of a new facility in Las Vegas, setting liquid H2 production in place to meet the growing demand from hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.

The North Las Vegas production facility and logistics center is the next step in the company’s H2 vision.

The plant is a 30-ton liquid hydrogen production facility. Air Liquide intends to use it to move ahead with its intentions to capitalize on rising demands from hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. As the transitions to H2 economies continues, the company intends to ensure that it has secured a top spot in meeting those needs.

Officially, the new plant opened on May 24, but its grand opening was this week. It is capable of producing adequate H2 to fuel 40,000 vehicles. The H2 is produced using steam reforming, which uses natural gas.

It is important to note that while the H2 itself is emission-free as a fuel, this method of its production does produce greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, it is not blue hydrogen, as the facility does not employ carbon capture and storage technologies. Air Liquide intends to try to offset some of those emissions by sourcing its natural gas from renewable sources such as landfills, according to the company’s director and advocate for hydrogen energy David Edwards.

This helps to ensure adequate refueling for the rising needs of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.

Edwards explained that because the methane from the landfill sources of natural gas would usually be emitted into the atmosphere, by capturing it and using it to create liquid H2, the outcome is a reduction of carbon intensity when compared to producing it with conventional fossil fuels such as diesel. Though far from a carbon emission-free method of production, it is intended to reduce carbon emissions in comparison to other conventional production methods.

Furthermore, Edwards also pointed out that the Las Vegas plant will be powered by clean energy and has been designed for reduced water reduction – a feature that is of particular importance in that geographical area. The water usage will be lower than what would have been required for an electrolyzer, which splits water in order to produce the H2 used by hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.

The facility to meet the demand for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles was first planned in 2017.

Air Liquide had already been planning to build the Las Vegas facility 5 years ago, well before there was a substantial national conversation underway, as is the case today, said Edwards. As far back as 2015, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles were already becoming a subject of growing interest in California and in the warehousing sector across the country.

Air Liquide recognized the size of demand back at that time and opted for a site in Las Vegas to meet that need. The site was selected for its proximity to the market in California, where the company has since been building out its refueling station network. The location was also made highly appealing to the company as city officials stepped in to expedite the project for rapid construction.

“The other thing that goes into picking a location is making sure you have available power, feedstock, access to transportation and favorable potential for the future,” said Edwards as reported in a recent Utility Dive report. “The Las Vegas area represents potential for growth with all of the potential entertainment venues, and growth happening on the northwest side is a good opportunity from the warehousing and trucking markets.”

Though the primary intention of the facility will be to meet the fueling needs of the growing number of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles – including the 13,000 already on Californian roads – it is also expected that specialty applications at that state’s ports and warehouses will also be catered to. The liquid hydrogen will also likely be sold to a range of different industry customers such as specialty chemicals and metals."
