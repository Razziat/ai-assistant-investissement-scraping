Air Liquide has been supplying industrial gases to this major Chinese industrial basin for more than 25 years, and already operates 7 production facilities there.

With an oxygen production capacity of more than 2,000 tons per day, this ASU will notably allow Air Liquide to support the growth of the chemical and steel industries in the Tianjin basin, secured by a new long term supply agreement with a major customer.

Air Liquide will build, own and operate this new ASU, which has been designed leveraging the Group’s latest state-of-the-art technology, for a low carbon and energy efficient production of oxygen, nitrogen and argon. This facility will also incorporate a dedicated capacity to support small-and-medium sized customers of liquid and packaged gases, including local hospitals requiring high-purity medical gases. It is planned to be operational in 2022.

Air Liquide China operates seven ASUs in Tianjin, as well as a network of multi-sourced pipelines that deliver oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen to adjacent customers.

François Abrial, member of the Air Liquide Group’s Executive Committee supervising Asia Pacific, said:"

Air Liquide will invest more than 160 million U.S. dollars to modernize existing assets and build a new Air Separation Unit (ASU) and Partial Oxidation Unit (POX).

With this agreement and additional production capacity of the new ASU and POX, Air Liquide will supply Eastman gaseous oxygen and nitrogen, as well as syngas. The new ASU and POX will begin production in late 2021 and will be integrated into the existing facilities.

The new POX will use the company’s patented Lurgi technology and will capture and recycle CO 2 , reducing the carbon intensity of operations, in line with the Group’s 2025 Climate Objectives.

“This project and supply agreement reflect Eastman’s focus to invest in growth opportunities through strategic partnerships to create positive economic and environmental benefits,” said Mark Costa, Eastman’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Eastman has deep roots in the greater Longview area and remains one of the area’s largest employers after 70 years of operation in Harrison County. We are committed to our community and appreciate the continued support of community leaders, our dedicated employees, and our operating partners.”

Michael J. Graff, Executive Vice President and Executive Committee Member, Air Liquide Group, said: “Air Liquide is pleased to further its longstanding relationship with Eastman with another significant investment at its Longview site in east Texas, the world’s single largest production facility of its type, and to further demonstrate Air Liquide’s ongoing commitment to deliver innovative technologies and safe, reliable and sustainable solutions for industry.”

Volvo gas tractors for Kuehne+Nagel trunking operation - Transport Engineer,"Thu, 17 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYW5zcG9ydGVuZ2luZWVyLm9yZy51ay90cmFuc3BvcnQtZW5naW5lZXItbmV3cy92b2x2by1nYXMtdHJhY3RvcnMtZm9yLWt1ZWhuZW5hZ2VsLXRydW5raW5nLW9wZXJhdGlvbi8yMzA1MTHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Volvo gas tractors for Kuehne+Nagel trunking operation

Logistics provider Kuehne+Nagel has put eight new Volvo FH Globetrotter LNG (liquified natural gas) tractor units into 24/7 operation on two major contracts with Whitbread and Costa, as part of a drive to reduce emissions and improve the sustainability of its transport operations.

Their arrival marks the first Volvos to enter service in Kuehne+Nagel’s UK fleet, following the firm’s participation in the Innovate UK-funded ‘Dedicated to Gas’ project. This evaluated the viability of Euro VI gas heavy goods vehicles as an alternative to diesel and demonstrated their potential to unlock significant CO2 savings and reduce running costs. Supplied by Volvo Truck and Bus Centre East Anglia, the 6x2 pusher-axle tractors feature 155 kg LNG tanks and feature Volvo’s 12-speed I-Shift automated transmission. The specification also includes the latest generation I-See predictive cruise control system, which analyses the topography to optimise speed and gear changes. The new trucks will pull temperature-controlled double-deck trailers on national trunking routes from the customer’s Wellingborough regional distribution centre (RDC) to sites in Avonmouth, London and Manchester. Each vehicle is expected to cover 125,000 miles per year, with refuelling taking place using an on-site facility operated by Air Liquide. Andrew Blake, national distribution manager at Kuehne+Nagel, says: “We’d previously run dual fuel trucks for seven years, but it was our involvement in the Dedicated to Gas trials which confirmed that LNG was the right approach to take. We’re projecting an initial 20% reduction in CO2 emissions on these routes using standard LNG, with the intention of moving quickly to bio-LNG to increase this reduction to at least 80% in the near future.” Volvo’s approach to natural gas stands out for using compression-ignition technology which relies upon small amounts of diesel to initiate ignition of the air-fuel mixture. This enables the Volvo G13C engine to deliver the same 454bhp and 2,300Nm of torque as its diesel-only counterpart, with matching service intervals and reliability. These engines also provide secondary vehicle retardation thanks to the patented Volvo Engine Brake. Blake explains: “From an engineering perspective we have absolute confidence in Volvo’s natural gas powertrain to deliver the performance we need in an intensive around-the-clock, 44-tonne application. We looked at the spark ignition options available in other vehicles, but we didn’t want any trade-off in terms of performance or fuel efficiency. The new vehicles have been supplied on a five-year Volvo Financial Services contract hire deal which incorporates a Volvo Gold Contract repair and maintenance package, supported by a 100% uptime promise. All scheduled servicing and maintenance will be carried out at Volvo Truck and Bus Centre East Anglia’s Wellingborough dealership, located less than five miles from the customer’s RDC.

Dry ice is the solid form of carbon dioxide. It is colorless, odorless, non-flammable, and slightly acidic. Dry ice is made by liquid CO2 to which is expanded to produce CO2 snow and then compressing it into conveniently sized dry ice blocks and pellets. Dry ice is mainly used for food preservation, machine blast cleaning and other fields.

The purified dry ice can be used for food & beverage preservation or eaten directly with food. The unpurified dry ice namely industry grade dry ice has broad applications for machine cleaning fields. Poland is a developed country where people with high standard life, lots of the food grade dry ice have be consumed every year.

Carbon dioxide is the byproducts for many of companies especially oil chemical company, but carbon dioxide is the raw materials for dry ice. So some companies sell their carbon dioxide to dry ice manufacturers. Both of them can benefit from this transaction.
