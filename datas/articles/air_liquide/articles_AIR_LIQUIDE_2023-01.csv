Autothermal Reforming (ATR) is one of the latest technologies utilized enabling the efficient production of large scale, low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia, when combined with carbon capture technology. One of the leading companies for ATR, Air Liquide's technology has been selected for Japan's first demonstration project owned and operated by INPEX CORPORATION to produce low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia.

While other reliable solutions are available on the market today, such as Steam Methane Reforming with carbon capture, ATR is one of the most suitable options for specific larger scale low-carbon hydrogen production facilities. When ATR is combined with carbon capture technology, customers can achieve higher energy efficiency, lower investments and a simplified single train production process to facilitate carbon capture of up to 99% in highly integrated industrial facilities.

Air Liquide is one of the leading companies for Autothermal Reforming with proprietary technologies in the ATR process for large scale syngas production applications. Air Liquide Engineering & Construction will now provide the technology for low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia production to a pilot project owned and operated by INPEX CORPORATION, a Japanese oil & gas exploration and production company. ATR will be part of the development of the Kashiwazaki Clean Hydrogen and Ammonia Project in the Hirai area of Kashiwazaki City, Niigata Prefecture, Japan. The overall project will be Japan’s first demonstration project integrating low-carbon Hydrogen and Ammonia production with carbon capture.

"Chevron, Air Liquide execs discuss development of hydrogen economy - BIC Magazine","Wed, 04 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaWNtYWdhemluZS5jb20vcHJvamVjdHMtZXhwYW5zaW9ucy9yZW5ld2FibGUtc3VzdGFpbmFiaWxpdHktaDItZXNnL2NoZXZyb24tYWlyLWxpcXVpZGUtZXhlY3MtZGlzY3Vzcy1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC1vZi1oeWRyb2dlbi1lYy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Remember that old saying, “Don’t put the cart before the horse?”

According to Katie Ellet, president of hydrogen energy and mobility for Air Liquide, this old sentiment is especially true regarding the concept of hydrogen-powered cars joining the fleets of alternate fuel vehicles.

Appropriate infrastructure really needs to be in place, Ellet said, before consumers will widely adopt their own hydrogen-powered modes of transportation. Heavier duty uses, such as semi-trailers, will give it the use case that drives that infrastructure development on a large scale (volume, magnitude and reliability) followed by the wider scale, passenger vehicle acceptance. “But I absolutely believe that it will happen,” Ellet said.

Despite her confidence in the inevitability of hydrogen-powered vehicles, Ellet added, “It would be my preference to drive a fuel cell electric vehicle.”

She further stated it’s important that the industry talk about different types of hydrogen, “whether it’s green hydrogen or blue hydrogen, and how we all work together to get where we need to be as an industry.”

“We absolutely believe that electrolysis and the creation of green hydrogen is part of it, but we must also have existing infrastructure that we can put carbon-capture technology on,” she said. “I think about it like this:, if a building is not energy efficient, we have a couple of options. We can tear it down and build an energy efficient building on top of it, or we can take the steps to make the existing building more energy efficient, and greener.”

There’s a need for both, Ellet said. “If we’re really going to achieve our carbon intensity goals, we need to push all available options. We have to make sure we have a very safe infrastructure, going forward.

Further, Ellet stated strongly that she believes experienced, long-term industry leaders must recognize that they “have a responsibility to follow these protocols and work hand in hand to make sure that we lay out the standards that make this environment work for all of us.”

Joining Ellet as a speaker at the Hydrogen North America 2022 conference held recently in Houston, Austin Knight, hydrogen vice president at Chevron New Energies, emphasized that it takes mindful collaboration among all its partners, from the top down, for the industry to achieve business goals.

Instead of concentrating on, and possibly being distracted by, “the age of hope and hype,” Knight said he believes industry leaders would be wise to be more focused on what’s here and happening now.

“It takes that full value chain,” Knight said. “We’re really good at working with a lot of people to make that whole value chain happen. We want the right partners in the right places to deliver the right proof points in this market.” Knight said he accentuates this point every day with his team.

“We will not try to do everything, nor should we,” he said. “It’s about getting leaders together to line up the value chain in such a way that we’re each really bringing our strengths and making this market real.

“It’s an exciting time to be in energy,” Knight concluded. “We know we have energy security needs, but we also have energy transition needs, and it’s really exciting to be able to do that collaboratively with a strong group of partners at the table.”

Ellet concurred with Knight’s enthusiasm. “We have a lot of interesting technologies in place, and now it’s a matter of scaling them for these new applications. We’re going to try to do that in the next 10 years, as opposed to what’s taken 100 years before. But we have the capability to do that, and if we work collaboratively I have no doubt that it can be done.”"

Airgas refuses to supply nitrogen for Alabama executions - AL.com,"Sun, 15 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDEvYWlyZ2FzLXJlZnVzZXMtdG8tc3VwcGx5LW5pdHJvZ2VuLWZvci1hbGFiYW1hLWV4ZWN1dGlvbnMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"One of Alabama’s largest suppliers of gas won’t supply nitrogen to the state’s prison system for nitrogen hypoxia executions.

Airgas, which was acquired by French-owned Air Liquide in 2016, is the largest U.S. distribution network in the packaged gas industry. The company has 24 branches in Alabama.

In a statement, an Airgas spokesperson said supplying gas for executions doesn’t fit in with the company’s mission. “Notwithstanding the philosophical and intellectual debate of the death penalty itself, supplying nitrogen for the purpose of human execution is not consistent with our company values.”

Airgas contacted Alabama in December to “reinforce the point and ensure that there was no confusion regarding Airgas’ position,” said the spokesperson.

“Therefore, Airgas has not and will not supply Alabama nitrogen or other inert gases to induce hypoxia for the purpose of human execution. Airgas’ contact with the State of Alabama has acknowledged receipt of our recent communication and confirmed their understanding.”

No state has yet to conduct an execution by nitrogen hypoxia, which would in theory kill a person by forcing them to breathe in nitrogen without any source of oxygen, leading to asphyxiation.

Alabama approved this method of killing death row inmates in 2018, and gave people sitting on Alabama Death Row a month-long window that summer to decide if they wanted to change their execution method from lethal injection to the untested-method of nitrogen hypoxia.

That process has come under scrutiny in lawsuits, from federal judges and the U.S. Supreme Court.

Executive Director Bianca Tylek of Worth Rises, a nonprofit that works to dismantle the prison industry and those who profit off of incarceration, applauded Airgas’ commitment to not aiding in executions.

“There is no ethical way to kill people,” she said.

“But to the extent that it has been causing extensive harm and trauma, and the governor has finally imposed a moratorium, we hope that disrupting the technological progress of nitrogen hypoxia causes Alabama and its leaders to reflect on their moral progress and terminate the death penalty altogether.”

Airgas’ chief executive officer told Worth Rises in a letter—which was confirmed by Airgas to be legitimate— that “any suggestion that Airgas is working with the state of Alabama, or anyone else, to develop nitrogen hypoxia as an execution method is categorically false.”

That letter also stated that the Alabama Department of Corrections “does not currently have nitrogen cylinders owned by Airgas, according to our records.”

Alabama spends hundreds of thousands of dollars with Airgas each year.

Airgas, which supplies gases other than nitrogen along with gas equipment, welding products, and safety products, was paid $287,247.92 by the state during fiscal year 2022, according to state records.

Multiple state industries were involved in the purchases, including the departments of forensic sciences, conservation and natural resources, transportation, public health and others.

Records show the ADOC purchased approximately $1,634, but there are no details as to what was purchased from the company.

Airgas’ stance on Alabama’s desire to implement nitrogen executions comes on the heels of Gov. Kay Ivey’s announcement in November that no executions would happen while an internal review was conducted on the ADOC’s lethal injection protocol.

Tylek said she hopes this marks the beginning of the end for Alabama executions. “Nobody has the right to kill somebody else. Period,” she said. “It doesn’t make you a greater human being because you’ve killed someone who has killed someone.”

In Alabama, four death row inmates were set to die by lethal injection in 2022; two of them survived after workers at the ADOC couldn’t start an intravenous line for the injections before the death warrants expired at midnight on their respective execution dates.

“If officers have not been able to locate a vein for lethal injection, then I have zero confidence that an officer will be able to properly seal a mask to ensure others don’t get hurt,” said Tylek.

“These are simple tasks, and to not get them right illustrates a much boarder issue that the death penalty cannot morally be carried out.”"

Chemicals and energy group Sasol has signed three power purchase agreements (PPAs) for almost 300MW of wind energy, which will help kick off its decarbonisation plans for its Southern African value chain.

News of the green power agreements did little to boost the Sasol share price, which was flat at R303 a share in Tuesday morning trade. The group also reported a 2% and 5% decline in sales revenues and volumes respectively for its six months to end December, due to continued operational challenges at its coal mines.

Sasol and Msenge Emoyeni Wind Farm have signed a long-term PPA for the supply of 69MW of wind powered renewable power to the Sasolburg operations and expected to be online within the first quarter of 2024. This, Sasol said, is key in achieving the first production of green hydrogen generated from renewable energy sources at Sasolburg and progressing the group's ambition to lead the development of a green hydrogen economy in Southern Africa.

Sasol and Air Liquide have also jointly signed two long-term PPAs with Enel Green Power for the supply of a total capacity of 220MW of wind powered renewable power to the Secunda operations.

Newsletter Daily SA Money Daily The biggest business, economic and market news of the day.

The three agreements are subject to meeting certain conditions.

The PPAs signal progress in Sasol's plans to reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from South African operations by at least 30% by 2030, off a 2017 baseline.

Sasol is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in SA after Eskom, and it has committed to a joint procurement initiative to procure a whopping 1 200MW of renewable energy capacity by 2030.

""Renewable power is a key lever towards Sasol’s greenhouse gas emission reduction, as part of our transition towards a more sustainable product portfolio,"" the group said in a statement.

Air Liquide and Sasol sign first long-term contract for the supply of renewable energy to the Secunda site - Air Liquide,"Tue, 24 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5haXJsaXF1aWRlLmNvbS9ncm91cC9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy1uZXdzLzIwMjMtMDEtMjQvYWlyLWxpcXVpZGUtYW5kLXNhc29sLXNpZ24tZmlyc3QtbG9uZy10ZXJtLWNvbnRyYWN0LXN1cHBseS1yZW5ld2FibGUtZW5lcmd5LXNlY3VuZGEtc2l0ZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide and Sasol have signed two Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) with Enel Green Power for the long-term supply of a total capacity of 220 MW of renewable power to Sasol’s Secunda site, in South Africa, where Air Liquide operates the biggest oxygen production site in the world. These PPAs are the first results of the Request for Proposal (RFP) process launched jointly by Air Liquide and Sasol in April, 2021, for the procurement of a total capacity of 900 MW of renewable energy. They will significantly contribute to the decarbonization of the Secunda site, and in particular to the targeted reduction by 30 % to 40 % of the CO2 emissions associated with the oxygen production by 2031.

Within the framework of these agreements with Air Liquide and Sasol, two local majority owned wind projects will be created by Enel Green Power, the Enel Group subsidiary dedicated to the development and management of power generated from renewable resources worldwide. The 220 MW wind powered renewable electricity production capacity is scheduled to be operational in 2025. This agreement is subject to regulatory and financial approvals.

Ronnie Chalmers, Vice President and Executive Committee Member of the Air Liquide Group, in charge of Africa Middle East & India, said:

By signing these long-term PPAs with Enel Green Power, Air Liquide and Sasol actively support the development of renewable energies in South Africa, for the benefit of the South African electrical power system and the fight against global warming. This will also contribute to the South African social transformation and a “Just Transition”, and more generally to South Africa’s economy and environment. In line with Air Liquide’s Sustainable Development objectives, and its ADVANCE strategic plan, which include reducing its absolute CO2 emissions starting around 2025 and reaching carbon neutrality by 2050, these PPAs also demonstrate the Group’s capacity to collaborate with its customers to provide solutions which contribute to the decarbonization of its assets as well as of its clients.

Priscillah Mabelane, Executive Vice President of Sasol’s Energy Business, said:

Sasol and Air Liquide’s efforts to procure a total of 900 MW of renewable energy to decarbonise our respective operations at Secunda is another step towards Sasol’s aim to procure 1.200 MW of renewable energy capacity from IPPs by 2030, representing one of the largest renewable energy procurement programmes from the private sector in South Africa. Sasol’s Renewable Energy Programme is aligned to the government’s REIPPP programme and plays a key role in creating alternative sources of energy for grid expansion to address South Africa’s current energy capacity constraints. Our work in the renewable energy space to secure PPA partners demonstrates the real progress Sasol is making towards its decarbonisation and ultimately, the development of a green economy.

In April 2021, Air Liquide and Sasol launched the largest corporate effort in South Africa to procure a total of 900 MW of renewable energy for their operations in Secunda, with an allocation of 500 MW to Sasol and 400 MW to Air Liquide. The two companies are negotiating with the remaining preferred bidders to this RFP to complete the balance of the renewable energy requested within the coming months.

Air Liquide acquired Sasol’s 16 oxygen production units in Secunda and has been operating them since June 2021, in the framework of a long-term supply contract with its long-term partner. Including another Air Separation Unit (ASU) it already operated for Sasol, Air Liquide thus now operates a total of 17 ASUs in Secunda, with a total capacity of 47,000 tonnes/day of oxygen. Air Liquide plans to reduce by 30 % to 40 % the CO2 emissions (Scope 2) arising from its operations on the Secunda site through a multi-year investment and modernization plan and a steep increase of the site’s procurement in renewable energies."

The renewable electricity from the projects is scheduled to be operational in 2025, with wind generators to be installed in the Kouga municipality and the Oyster Bay Local municipality, about 15 km from Humansdorp, in the Eastern Cape, and wheeled over the national grid.

The 20-year power purchase agreements (PPAs), which are still subject to regulatory and financial approvals, are the first to be signed following a tender process launched jointly by the two companies in April 2021.

The joint request for proposals (RFP) for 900 MW is the largest corporate renewables procurement in South Africa to date and forms part of Sasol’s plan to procure 1 200 MW of renewable electricity from independent power producers by 2030.

Sasol has a 500 MW allocation within the 900 MW and Air Liquide 400 MW.

The two companies report that they are negotiating with the remaining preferred bidders identified through the RFP to procure the balance of the renewable energy within the coming months.

In a joint statement, the companies said the renewable energy arising from the procurement process will contribute significantly to the 2031 target of reducing the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions associated with the oxygen production by between 30% to 40%.

Sasol is under growing pressure to reduce its carbon emissions, particularly at Secunda, which is among the largest single-site emitters of the greenhouse gas globally.

In 2021, the JSE-listed group revised its initial target of reducing emissions by only 10% by 2030 to 30%. The new target has been set against a 2017 baseline of 63.9-million carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) tons and implies a reduction to 44.7-million CO2e tons by 2030.

Sasol’s Energy Business executive VP Priscillah Mabelane said the procurement “demonstrates the real progress Sasol is making towards its decarbonisation” and will also play a key role in creating alternative sources of energy to address South Africa’s current energy capacity constraints.

South Africans are enduring an intense period of electricity loadshedding, with more than 200 days of disruption in 2022 and with rotational power cuts having been implemented on every day since the start of 2023.

Plans developed by Eskom and the National Energy Crisis Committee indicate that loadshedding will need to be implemented for at least another two years as the utility struggles to stabilise its coal fleet and while new supply and demand mechanisms are introduced.

Air Liquide Group VP and executive committee member Ronnie Chalmers said that by signing the long-term PPAs with Enel Green, Air Liquide and Sasol were actively supporting the development of renewables in South Africa, which would support both the electrical power system and the fight against global warming.

Air Liquide, which acquired Sasol’s 16 oxygen production units in Secunda in 2021, operates 17 air separation units for Sasol, with a total oxygen capacity of 47 000 t/d."

According to the group, it is committed to reducing its absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from its South African operations by at least 30% by 2030, off a 2017 baseline.

Sasol is South Africa’s biggest fuel producer with major influence over the supply of petroleum products in the country.

The widespread influence of the company was seen in August last year when a disruption caused Sasol to declare a force majeure on petroleum products at its Natref station.

The shutdown meant that the whole of South Africa’s oil-refinery fleet was out of service as other facilities have had production suspended for years prior.

The group is now adding to its focus, noting that renewable power is a key lever towards its GHG emissions reduction and as part of its transition towards a more sustainable product portfolio.

Sasol and Msenge Emoyeni Wind Farm (Pty) Ltd (Msenge) have now signed a long-term power purchase agreement for the supply of 69MW of wind-powered renewable power to the group’s Sasolburg operations.

This is key in achieving the first production of green hydrogen generated from renewable energy sources at Sasolburg and progressing its ambition to lead the development of a green hydrogen economy in Southern Africa, said the company.

The renewable capacity is anticipated to be operational within the first quarter of 2024.

The group has further engaged with Air Liquide, a French multinational company that produces and supplies industrial gases and services to various industries, by signing two long-term power purchase agreements with Enel Green Power for the supply of a total capacity of 220MW of wind-powered renewable power to its Secunda operations.

“The projects are expected to be operational in 2025. The concluded agreements are the first as part of a joint procurement initiative with Air Liquide and demonstrate Sasol’s commitment to procuring 1 200MW of renewable energy capacity by 2030.”

Financials

Sasol’s recent productions and sales metrics for the six months ended 31 December 2022, paint a positive picture for the company, with it remaining well positioned despite the negative impact of weaker global economic growth.

According to the company, its chemicals business continued to face challenging market conditions, including the macro-economic environment downturn, inflationary pressures, Covid-19 impacts in China and sustained higher energy prices in Europe.

“In addition, production and supply chain challenges in South Africa impacted our ability to produce and move product to customers,” Sasol reported.

“Despite these challenges, external sales revenue for H1 FY23 was only 2% lower compared to H1 FY22, driven by lower sales volumes. H1 FY23 sales volumes were 5% lower than H1 FY22, largely due to lower Eurasia volumes, offset by higher sales volumes in America.”

“The average basket price increased by 3% from H1 FY22 but decreased by 14 compared to Q1 FY23 due to the challenging economic environment.”

First Demonstration Of A Hydrogen Fuel Cell Truck Takes Place At Port Of Houston - H2 News - Hydrogen News - Green Hydrogen Report,"Wed, 18 Jan 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmh5ZHJvZ2VuZnVlbG5ld3MuY29tL2Z1ZWwtY2VsbC10cnVjay1haXItbGlxdWlkZS84NTU2ODg4L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The demonstration was kicked off by Air Liquide, Hyzon Motors and TALKE.

The companies launched the first demonstration of a hydrogen fuel cell truck at the Port of Houston, which was the site of a 10-day trial of Hyzon’s H2 trucks that TALKE Group deployed in daily drayage operations hauling cargo loads within the Texas-based port.

The demonstration of hydrogen mobility is essential for speeding up the clean fuel energy transition.

The hydrogen fuel cell truck demonstration is important for accelerating the energy transition toward clean fuel, particularly for supporting heavy duty vehicles like trucks and hydrogen infrastructure. Air Liquide signed a separate agreement with Hyzon Motors early in 2022 to commercially pilot and test two heavy duty hydrogen fuel cell electric trucks.

A pioneer in hydrogen production, hydrogen distribution and fueling logistics, Air Liquide provided a reliable and safe supply of hydrogen fuel to the H2 truck throughout the 10-day trial. Additionally, Air Liquide is the operator of one of the only facilities in the United States that is able to supply liquid hydrogen for H2 refuelling operations.

The hydrogen fuel cell truck demonstration is part of Air Liquide’s action to advance the energy transition.

Decarbonizing the transportation sector, including heavy-duty applications like drayage operations and freight at US ports, is essential for the country to reach its climate change goals. Moving goods from ports is a critical first step to transport goods throughout the US. As such, decarbonizing ports and port operations is vital to the economy.

“Air Liquide is taking actions to advance the energy transition by decarbonizing the transportation sector and transforming heavy duty transportation through the use of hydrogen,” said Laura Parkan, vide president, Hydrogen Energy Americas, in a recent Air Liquid news release.

“Through collaboration with industry peers and committed partners in government and our communities, we can reach our decarbonization objectives and invent a more sustainable future for all,” added Parkan.

The hydrogen fuel cell truck demonstration took place on December 13 at the Port of Houston. In attendance at the demonstration was Offices of Senator Cornyn, Congressman Crenshaw, and Harris County Commissioner-Elect Lesley Briones.

What do you think is the BIGGEST problem stopping the world from using more green hydrogen? No industry compliance and certification standards in place Not enough financial interest from investors or companies Lack of demand Lack of public education Too expensive to make but this will change in the next few years Transportation and storage technology"
