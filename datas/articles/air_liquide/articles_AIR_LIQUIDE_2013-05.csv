Air Liquide faces P6 million lawsuit - Mmegi Online,"Wed, 22 May 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1tZWdpLmJ3L25ld3MvYWlyLWxpcXVpZGUtZmFjZXMtcDYtbWlsbGlvbi1sYXdzdWl0L25ld3PSASVodHRwczovL3d3dy5tbWVnaS5idy9hbXBBcnRpY2xlLzYwNTc5?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Through his attorneys, Otto Itumeleng Law Chambers, Ntwaagae says that he was sacked though he did not breach his contract of employment and since his dismissal, he has not been paid his dues. He says the company has failed to reinstate him or pay the remaining balance of the contract price up to the time he would have retired. Ntwaagae entered into employment with Air Liquide on August 1, 2008 for an unspecific period. His attorneys says that the contract entitled him to a salary of P12,700 per month and that the increment was to be performance based. ""As at the time of the termination of the plaintiff's employment, the plaintiff was drawing a salary in the sum of P28,200,"" states the court papers.

Ntwaagae was also entitled to a fixed yearly bonus equal to one month's basic salary payable in November on pro rata temporis (in proportion to the time he worked during the year). He was entitled to a 7.5 percent performance bonus calculated on the basis of his annual salary. His attorneys say the person who purported to terminate his contract had no authority to do so and the action contravened the company's own rules and conditions of service. ""The defendant did not have a valid reason to dismiss the plaintiff and it failed to follow the correct procedure in conducting the disciplinary hearing against plaintiff. Plaintiff avers that defendant failed to pay him his annual performance bonus as provided for in the performance contract. Defendant was obliged to pay the performance bonus in November 2011,"" the attorneys say. It is alleged that the termination of employment was unlawful and wrongful and notwithstanding written and verbal demands, the company has not purged any of the incidences of breach. As a consequence of the unlawful and wrongful termination of the plaintiff's contract of employment, the company is liable to reinstate Ntwaagae and pay him the sum equivalent to his monthly salary from the date of dismissal (December 19, 2011) until reinstatement."
