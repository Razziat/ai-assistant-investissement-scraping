Striking Airgas Teamsters Extend Picket Lines Throughout New England - International Brotherhood of Teamsters,"Fri, 02 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdGVhbXN0ZXIub3JnLzIwMTcvMDYvc3RyaWtpbmctYWlyZ2FzLXRlYW1zdGVycy1leHRlbmQtcGlja2V0LWxpbmVzLXRocm91Z2hvdXQtbmV3LWVuZ2xhbmQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(EAST GREENWICH, R.I.) – Airgas USA employees who went on strike Tuesday extended picket lines to four additional Airgas locations yesterday and today: Hingham and Billerica, Mass.; Salem, N.H.; and Bangor, Maine. No Airgas Teamsters in those locations have crossed the extended picket lines.

The striking Teamsters are members of Local 251 in Rhode Island. They work as truck drivers and gas cylinder fillers, supplying gases to many Rhode Island hospitals as well as Veterans Administration facilities in Providence and Bristol, the Air National Guard, Naval Base Newport, Raytheon, Fuji Film and Electric Boat.

Airgas is America’s largest distributor of industrial, medical and specialty gases. Airgas’ parent corporation is France-based Air Liquide [EPA: AI], which is the world’s largest distributor of these gases and is a Forbes Global 2000 company.

As he walked the line early this morning, Airgas shop steward Carlos Salgado said, “Our work earns huge profits for Airgas and Air Liquide. Air Liquide earned $20 billion last year, of which $2 billion was pure profit.”

Salgado continued, “Like all workers, we deserve a secure retirement and high-quality, affordable healthcare. We asked for a defined benefit pension plan as well as the affordable health plan that union workers at Airgas’ competitors have. Airgas refused to consider our proposals, so we are on strike – and now we have exercised our legal right to extend picket lines.”

“Teamsters in New England understand solidarity and working together to ensure all workers are treated fairly and with respect,” said Sean O’Brien, Teamsters International Vice President and Secretary-Treasurer of Teamsters Joint Council 10 in New England. “I’m happy to see that our other Airgas members have chosen to honor their Rhode Island brothers’ picket lines.”

In 2015, Airgas locked out its employees in Hingham, Mass. during contract negotiations. The workers there, members of Teamsters Local 25, extended picket lines to Airgas’ other New England facilities.

“Our brothers in Rhode Island supported us in 2015 by honoring our picket line,” said chief shop steward Bob Farquharson at Airgas in Hingham. “Of course we are going to support them during their strike for fair treatment. We aren’t going to cross their picket line.”

Jeffery Padellaro, Secretary-Treasurer of Teamsters Local 633 in New Hampshire, said, “Airgas has a pattern in New England of being abusive to workers. We will continue to stick together to stand up for each other.”

Brett Miller, Principal Officer of Teamsters Local 340 in Maine, said, “I’m proud that our members are also honoring their Rhode Island brothers’ picket lines. That’s what solidarity is all about.”

On May 9, Airgas sent a letter to employees that violates federal labor law, which bans companies from negotiating directly with workers about their union contract. Local 251 filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board.

“It is outrageous that Airgas decided to violate federal labor law that’s meant to protect workers’ rights,” said Matthew Taibi, Secretary-Treasurer of Local 251.

Taibi continued, “It’s disheartening to have to go out on strike to send the company a wake-up call. But the silver lining is the strong support that Teamster locals and members are giving us across the entire region.”"
Everybody Wins in Divestitures - Bain & Company,"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhaW4uY29tL2luc2lnaHRzL2V2ZXJ5Ym9keS13aW5zLWluLWRpdmVzdGl0dXJlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Executives hesitate to sell noncore businesses for many reasons. Many are reluctant to shed revenue, concerned about the market’s reaction to a smaller company and the challenge of stranded costs. Some worry about selling low, reasoning that with an additional year or two, the business could improve its trajectory. Others have trouble accepting the fact that it could perform better in another’s hands. Still others view divestitures as a hassle: a lot of work with which their teams are less familiar. While most companies have at least some track record at buying and integrating businesses, divestitures often require flexing muscles that are underdeveloped.

The good news is that divestitures, particularly ones that strategically clean up a company’s portfolio and that are positioned to command an optimal price, can generate shareholder value. They can also create a catalyzing event for improving the remaining business. When done well, they reduce complexity and provide fuel for the company to pump back into its core.

Dispelling divestiture myths

Our recent research and experience working on deals across industries has helped us dispel the myths that have made divestitures an underutilized tool for shareholder value creation. The fact is that companies achieve better results when they take a four-step approach. They need to proactively and selectively prune their portfolios to select the right assets to divest. And when they decide to divest, sellers yield higher multiples by investing the time, talent and money required to make a business attractive for sale, instead of waiting until it’s too late and selling quickly. They need to run a smooth selling process that clearly communicates value to buyers and ultimately implement a low-risk carve-out program aimed at minimizing execution costs and future stranded costs.

As part of our ongoing work with divestitures, Bain & Company studied 2,100 public companies and found those engaging in focused divestment outperform inactive companies by about 15% over a 10-year period, as measured by total shareholder return (TSR).1 The results are even better for companies that combine focused divestments with a repeatable M&A model. They outperform inactive companies by nearly 40% over a 10-year period and generate more than twice the sales and profit growth. Based on our analysis, $100 invested in inactive companies in 2005 would have grown to $181 in 2015. By comparison, the same $100 invested in a focused divestor that also engaged in frequent and material M&A would have grown to $252 (see Figure 1).

Typically, inactive companies underperform because they don’t shed the noncore parts of their portfolio. As a result, they continue to tie up management time and capital in businesses in which they are not playing to win. On the other hand, active sellers free up the time and capital to invest in areas where they are best positioned to grow and lead.

Companies such as Air Liquide and Henkel enjoy the benefits of divestments and repeatable M&A. Industrial gases company Air Liquide made more than 130 acquisitions and roughly 25 divestments over the past decade, contributing to an annual TSR of 11%. For its part, chemicals and consumer goods company Henkel made roughly an equal number of acquisitions and divestments during the same period. Regularly thinning its portfolio has contributed to Henkel’s annual TSR of 17.3% over the past 10 years. This compares with an average TSR for a comparative set of companies of 6.2% over the same time period.2

We explored 137 of the largest divestitures conducted by the 2,160 companies in our study to better understand the factors contributing to success in divestitures. Several of the findings were counterintuitive.

For example, companies that divest with the primary stated aim of raising cash to pay back debt don’t do particularly well. These companies saw their market caps increase only 1.4% in the three months after the announcement (compared with the three months prior to the announcement). Instead, markets reward strategic sellers. Those that were recognized by equity analysts and other market observers as divesting to focus on their core saw their market cap rise by 7.9% three months following the announcement.

Jim Wininger, a partner with Bain's Mergers & Acquisitions practice, shares how a systematic and proactive approach to divesting helps companies outperform the market.

Everybody wins

Our research also helped expose a major myth. One of the fundamental barriers that hold many companies back is a widely held fear that they’re selling low. They worry that buyers will win at their expense because multiple studies have shown that companies acquiring carve-outs do better than those that acquire whole companies. Among the reasons: Carved-out businesses often are underinvested in by the parent and can be more relevant to an acquirer’s core. However, it is also true that sellers of carve-outs do better than inactive companies because they generate capital to reallocate to their core and can focus management and scarce resources on the best parts of the business.

There’s a straightforward value equation in divestitures.

On the cost side of the equation, sellers bear execution costs, which can get inflated when a company doesn’t run an organized process and distracts employees for too long. That’s why the best companies identify and allocate the right people, tools and processes to the asset to be divested, defining an approach to timely separation that will not distract the base business (and a distracted base business is typically much more expensive than any transaction fees).

Longer term, companies can get stuck with stranded costs after the business is sold. These are costs related to everything from IT systems to back-office functions to the physical infrastructure built up to support scale. To minimize these longer-term costs, the most successful divesting companies proactively account for the ways that a sale may create stranded costs in the remaining portfolio and lay a plan to optimize their supply chain, route to market and general and administrative expenses for a more focused company. This can even create a forcing function for a broader companywide transformation if the seller chooses.

On the reward side of the equation, sellers can command the highest price by targeting buyers that have the most to gain and fully preparing the asset for sale. They take the time required to sharply define the business to be divested, determine what it would take to bring that business to full potential and even implement initiatives that begin to demonstrate the performance gains that could be achieved by the buyer. There are longer-term rewards, too. Sellers win by implementing a divestiture roadmap and repeatable M&A process that reinforces their core—they know what fits and what doesn’t, as well as where to double down for the outsized gains that our research has uncovered.

Four steps for successful divesting

Four distinct processes form the basis of value creation through successful divesting. We’ll look at them one by one.

Proactively manage your portfolio. Start with the basics of understanding how all of your portfolio businesses contribute to your core and regularly assess them for fit. What is each business’s competitive position and ability to win? Do you have the right resources and capabilities to take it to full potential? If not, are there other companies where it would be a better fit? To be attuned to divestiture candidates, evaluate your portfolio from the outside in, anticipating disruption and redefinition opportunities. Only by systematically assessing your portfolio can you identify the business units that would deliver more value in another owner’s hands. In the pharmaceutical industry, for example, Bain recently found that companies that combine category leadership with portfolio focus deliver annual total shareholder returns that are more than twice those of companies with diversified portfolios that maintain a tail of smaller positions. (See the Bain Brief “Focus Matters: How Biopharma Can Reward Shareholders.”)

Thoroughly plan and prepare to optimize value. Don’t race to sell the asset. Create a blueprint for making it attractive prior to selling—even better, begin implementing some of those initiatives prior to sale. We have found that 6 to 12 months is the right length of time to establish the blueprint and demonstrate progress. This allows you to improve the value of the business while you still own it and also demonstrates to a potential buyer what is possible. Both of these can help you achieve a higher price. Proven success typically raises the profits of the divested business. At the same time, these early successes also point to a better future, which can help to improve valuation multiples that sellers will pay. An important consideration: Include strong talent in the business in the predivestiture period. Good executives can help spur the growth and margin improvement that adds a lot of value.

A major US aerospace and defense company believed that it would not find a buyer for one of its noncore business units—it was pursuing a sale process, although leadership internally believed that its only option was to spin off the business. In the process of preparing an equity story and separation program for the business unit, it identified ways in which the business could thrive outside of the parent. The aerospace company saw far more potential than it had anticipated, in both revenue growth and cost opportunities, and it embarked on a broad-ranging cost initiative. This process helped give confidence to a buyer, leading to a transaction in which the buyer later announced a synergy program based heavily on that cost initiative.

While determining how to increase the value of the divested business, it is also important to do the same for the remaining company. Again, the divestiture process creates a catalyzing event for determining how to right-size the remaining company, beginning by estimating the level of anticipated dis-synergies and developing a plan to offset them. The best companies plan to minimize stranded costs by adapting the infrastructure and the back office, as well as adjusting the IT architecture to match the smaller scale and shape of the post-divestiture business.

Focus your selling process on buyer value creation. Many sellers leave money on the table by shortcutting the divestiture process. Once they decide to divest they may call an investment banker, put an offering memorandum together and move as fast as they can. Based on our experience, divesting companies with the strongest track records take a more thoughtful approach. They devote the required resources to perform reverse due diligence to help decide who could create more value and how it could be created—critical knowledge that helps a seller negotiate the best deal.

Develop a short list of potential buyers that would have the most to gain by leveraging their existing capabilities to do better with your business. As part of the selling process, communicate clearly how a buyer could execute on the prescribed initiatives in those first 100 days and beyond. Also important: anticipating a buyer’s demands and establishing the principles for any temporary service agreements (TSAs) that you’ll need to provide to the buyer as part of the deal; having a clearly thought-out approach makes you a stronger negotiator.

Use the carve-out moment to make the remaining company future-ready. The deal’s been made. It’s now critical to carve out the old business, adhering to your priorities with a low-risk process that neither imposes risk on the business nor distracts the team. It is also an opportunity to wipe the slate clean and prepare for the future with a more focused business.

We find that the best companies establish a separation management office to plan and execute the carve-out while controlling one-off costs and managing TSA commitments. They develop a well-thought-out internal and external communications plan, optimizing the remaining company’s operating model and infrastructure for the future portfolio. They ensure robust TSA governance and then remove the associated costs.

A global beverage company faced a challenge that seemed impossible: selling three large businesses that were ingrained in the parent’s global footprint while concurrently integrating a larger acquisition that also has worldwide operations.

The seller set up a world-class carve-out program, taking advantage of well-proven playbooks, and staffing a strong separation management office with top-performing global managers. It organized the program around key decisions that governed the process and ensured adherence to the timetable, an approach that proved to be the most effective way to manage the carve-out and collaborate with buyers for a seamless transition. Overall, the company successfully coordinated the efforts of hundreds of employees across buyers and sellers in dozens of countries, splitting hundreds of supply contracts, designing and implementing separate IT architectures for each business, planning and staffing independent organizations, and negotiating the details for hundreds of TSAs.

The result? The beverage company protected its intellectual property, ensured the right people were in the right jobs and optimized the remaining organization to avoid stranded costs, ultimately allowing the company to generate record-setting synergies and overdeliver on shareholder value creation.

Indeed, as more companies are discovering, divestitures are an important tool in a senior leadership team’s arsenal. They can deliver mutual benefits to both sellers and buyers. They are complex, however, and many companies’ muscles are not as well-developed with divestitures as they are with acquisitions. As a result, divestitures need careful attention both before and after the sale to deliver outsized value. Companies that regularly prune their portfolio, take an active hand in preparing assets for sale, manage the separation and use the sale funds to acquire core assets in a repeatable M&A program outperform inactives by 40%. That’s how divesting can be a win-win for buyers and sellers.

1 Inactive companies are those that did not engage in divestment activity over 2005–2015; total shareholder return is defined as stock price changes assuming reinvestment of cash dividends.

2 Number of acquisitions and divestments include transactions made by subsidiaries, including by companies acquired over the years. Acquisitions include outright purchase, majority interest and acquisition of asset transactions as reported by Dealogic, thereby excluding partial or remaining interest acquisition or increase in controlling stake. Consortium, intracompany and real estate deals are excluded from consideration.

Report to Congress: Out of Breath - Military Aircraft Oxygen Issues - USNI News - USNI News,"Wed, 28 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy51c25pLm9yZy8yMDE3LzA2LzI4L3JlcG9ydC1jb25ncmVzcy1icmVhdGgtbWlsaXRhcnktYWlyY3JhZnQtb3h5Z2VuLWlzc3Vlc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The following is the June 21, 2017 CRS Insight brief to Congress, Out of Breath: Military Aircraft Oxygen Issues.

The Air Force recently grounded some of its newest aircraft, F-35A strike fighters, due to incidents in which pilots became physiologically impaired with symptoms of oxygen deficiency while flying. Although the root cause of the F-35 incidents has not yet been established, the grounding has renewed attention on hypoxia, a physical condition caused by oxygen deficiency that may result in temporary cognitive and physiological impairment and possible loss of consciousness. Hypoxia has affected pilots of F-22, F/A-18, and T-45 aircraft in recent years.

Military aircraft (and jet aircraft generally) operate at altitudes where there is not enough oxygen for humans to retain consciousness without supplemental oxygen supplies. For several decades, combat aircraft relied on canisters of compressed liquid or gaseous oxygen to provide pilots sufficient oxygen. However, the finite oxygen supply limited mission duration, and its handling complicated aircraft maintenance. This led to the development of On-Board Oxygen Generation Systems, or OBOGS. Developed in the early 1980s, OBOGS was conceived as a source of limitless oxygen.

The system works by purifying air drawn from the plane’s engine compressor (called “bleed air”) before it reaches combustion. That air is run through a series of scrubbers, or “sieve beds,” that remove nitrogen. The resulting gas going to the pilot is approximately 95% oxygen and 5% argon.

OBOGS systems are made by a number of contractors, including Honeywell, Cobham, Air Liquide, and others. How is this different from commercial aircraft?

Most commercial aircraft also use engine bleed air to provide air for cabin climate control and pressurization. That air is not filtered to remove nitrogen, because commercial aircraft cabins are pressurized to a constant altitude, usually at or around 8,000 feet. At this pressure altitude, the cabin air climate retains sufficient oxygen for human needs.

In contrast, combat aircraft pressurization varies as a function of altitude, with a fixed difference between cabin and outside pressure. Military aircraft can change altitude (and thus cabin pressure) quite rapidly, which could cause physical complications (such as “bends,” or the formation of nitrogen bubbles in the blood) were a higher ratio of nitrogen present.

F-22 incidents

Although hypoxia cases occur at a steady but low rate in normal operations (due to system failure, maintenance, or other issues), the condition came to prominence in 2010, after the loss of an F-22 Raptor and its pilot following a suspected oxygen loss. This highlighted physiological issues with the F-22, including 12 hypoxia-like incidents between 2008 and 2011, and led to a grounding of the F-22 force pending investigation and resolution. The matter was given additional prominence when two F-22 pilots appeared on the newsmagazine 60 Minutes to discuss their refusal to fly the F-22.

In 2012, the House Armed Services Committee held a hearing to evaluate the results of the Air Force’s investigation. Ultimately, the Air Force found that the F-22 issues were not due to the supply of oxygen. Instead, a combination of factors was cited—most notably, that a valve controlling the pilot’s pressure vest could allow the vest to inflate unnecessarily, which physically restricted the pilot’s ability to breathe.

F/A-18 incidents

Navy testimony prepared for a March, 2017, House Armed Services Committee hearing indicates that the rate of physiological incidents possibly attributed to oxygen issues in F/A-18E/F Super Hornets has been rising steadily since 2010. There were a reported 297 such incidents in F/A-18s between May 2010 and October 2015. Oxygen system issues may have contributed to the deaths of four F/A-18 pilots in the Navy.

A Navy report on the F/A-18 and T-45 incidents, redacted for public release, stated, “the Navy has not yet been able to pinpoint a specific root cause of the (physiological incidents) in the T-45 and the FA-18 aircraft.” It also stated:

The integration of the on-board oxygen generation system (OBOGS) in the T-45 and FA-18 is inadequate to consistently provide high quality breathing air. To varying degrees, neither aircraft is equipped to continuously provide clean, dry air to OBOGS—a design specification for the device. The net result is contaminants can enter aircrew breathing air provided by OBOGS and potentially induce hypoxia.

A Navy Physiological Episode Team continues to investigate the F/A-18 incidents to establish a root cause. In the meantime, the Navy has implemented a number of procedures and restrictions to minimize possible effects on the force.

F/A-18E/Fs were originally expected to be in service for 6,000 flight hours. The Navy now expects them to fly for 9,000 hours. The Navy is in the process of upgrading the original OBOGS sieve beds for all F/A-18s (including “legacy” F/A- 18A/D models.)

T-45 incidents

In May 2017, the Navy grounded its 197 T-45 trainer jets to address concerns from instructor pilots who were refusing to fly due to an increase in oxygen-related physiological incidents. Originally scheduled to last two days, the grounding continues, which is building a backlog in flight training at the rate of 25 prospective pilots per month.

The Navy report on the F/A-18 and T-45 incidents indicated that the OBOGS sieves used in some T-45 aircraft had been recycled after use in F/A-18s, indicating a possible connection among the Navy incidents.

F-35 incidents

In June 2017, the Air Force grounded 55 F-35A Lightning II strike fighters for 11 days after five incidents resembling

hypoxia. The grounding affected only aircraft of the 56th Fighter Wing at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, used for training; the five incidents all came from that base. Subsequently, the Air Force revealed 10 other F-35A physiological events dating to 2011. The OBOGS system on Luke F-35As is the same as that in other Air Force aircraft, and those flown by the Navy and Marine Corps. No similar issues have been reported with other services’ F-35s.

An Air Force team is investigating the incidents. Flight restrictions and other procedures have been implemented to reduce risk as the unit resumes operation.

CRS will follow this issue and update its publications as events warrant.

“Plant 4.0” Start-Up Incubator: a 2nd Edition on IoT With Five New Partners - Total,"Tue, 27 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vdG90YWxlbmVyZ2llcy5jb20vbWVkaWEvbmV3cy9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy9wbGFudC00MC1zdGFydC1pbmN1YmF0b3ItMm5kLWVkaXRpb24taW90LWZpdmUtbmV3LXBhcnRuZXJz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris, June 27, 2017 - Total is today launching its second Plant 4.0 start-up incubator, joined this year by Air Liquide, AREVA, Eiffage, Solvay and VINCI Energies. This is the very first multicorporate Plant 4.0 start-up incubator in the world. The partners’ common goal is to accelerate the deployment of digital technology in industry.

Buoyed by the success of the Plant 4.0 start-up incubator launched by Total in 2016, the Group decided to repeat the experience, this time opening up the project to include other industry partners, on the narrower theme of innovative solutions offered by the industrial Internet of Things (IoT).

This open innovation approach aims to identify the start-ups that offer practical, relatively mature industrial solutions to meet specialized operational requirements. The fledgling companies can test their technology, product or service directly with their potential customers and are put in contact with the incubator’s manufacturing partners and their start-up ecosystems. Total and the other partners will also share their expertise with the successful candidates.

With the spread of sensors and new developments in data collection and management, innovative solutions can improve the efficiency and boost the performance of plants and different industries. This international call for projects focuses on connected objects in industry in four areas:

Acoustic detection of leaks or anomalies.

Corrosion monitoring.

Non-invasive flow measurement.

Manual valve position displays.

“Total works in an open innovation process with start-ups and manufacturing partners because we all face the same challenges. Building digital solutions together speeds up their deployment in our plants and industrial facilities,” says Gilles Cochevelou, Chief Digital Officer at Total. “Digital tech improves safety and efficiency, while reducing costs. It offers a world of opportunities and could increase competitiveness in industry and for start-ups.”

To participate:

Register at: www.plant4-0-startup-incubator.com.

The closing date for submissions is September 2, 2017.

Shortlisted projects will be presented to the panel of judges.

The selection committee will reveal the names of the first start-ups selected in the fourth quarter of 2017.

The successful start-ups may be incubated for several months. The judges will include managers and experts from Total, Air Liquide, AREVA, Eiffage, Solvay, VINCI Energies and their partner Impulse Labs, which specializes in accelerating energy- and industry-related start-ups.

For the first incubator, all industrial digital tech fields were covered by Total, from robotics, transportation, IoT, cybersecurity and remote diagnostics to augmented reality, drones and artificial intelligence. Out of 150 submissions, 24 start-ups were shortlisted and 9 selected for incubation periods of about 6 months. Total introduced streamlined processes for collaboration with the start-ups, for example by having a single contact person. Proofs of concept (pilots) were conducted at production facilities and some of the start-ups continue to work with Total today.

Why participate in a multicorporate incubator?

""Our involvement in the"" Plant 4.0"" incubator reflects our Digital Transformation strategy, whose management of ecosystems is a major axis,"" underlines Olivier Delabroy, VP Digital Transformation, Air Liquide. ""The relationships we have built and continue to enhance with start-ups are a critical part of our open innovation approach. It is a long-term, partnership-based approach aiming at accelerating innovation and our Digital Transformation, focused on usages and design, serving the customer experience. This proximity with start-ups helps us to increase our agility and to reinforce the expertise required to carry out projects in various fields, including IoT. In this respect, we look forward to joining this incubator that Total is opening for the first time to external partners.""

“Industry 4.0 concepts, ‎including IoT, are the first pillar of our digital transformation program. We have over three years of experience with Open Innovation and are very pleased with the results. For New AREVA, joining the Plant 4.0 incubator is in line with this and reflects our willingness to enhance our involvement in industrial collaboration programs,” commented Jean-Luc Delcuvellerie, Digital Transformation Program Manager, New AREVA.

“The participation in Total's ""Plant 4.0"" incubator with key industrial players is a way for Eiffage to work within a strong dynamic of open innovation, on the issues already identified. The pool of qualified start-ups and the identified uses will allow us to support the deployment of digital technologies in our industrial activities to improve our performance, also accompanying the Group itself in the digital transformation” stated Valérie David, Sustainable development and transversal innovation Director, Eiffage.

""The teaming up of this group of industrial companies with specialized start-ups will help to efficiently identify and address the digital needs of the industry. The cutting-edge solutions these start-up companies can bring will accelerate the digital revolution that will transform our industrial sites,"" said Alain Faessler, Solvay Group General Manager Industrial.

For Olivier Albessard, Brand director of Actemium, the VINCI Energies brand dedicated to the industrial process: ""Partnering with startups and niche experts allows agility, creativity and a degree of solutions customization that accelerate our capacity to design innovative offers for the industry of the future.

"""Operation Opera"": The Israeli Air Strike on an Iraqi Nuclear Reactor. - The Aviationist","Wed, 07 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYXZpYXRpb25pc3QuY29tLzIwMTcvMDYvMDcvb3BlcmF0aW9uLW9wZXJhLXRoZS1pc3JhZWxpLWFpci1zdHJpa2Utb24tYW4taXJhcWktbnVjbGVhci1yZWFjdG9yL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Israelis Shock The World With Audacious First Ever F-16 Strike.

1735 HRs Local, Sunday, June 7, 1981. Al-Tuwaythah Nuclear Research Facility, outside Baghdad, Iraq.

Iraqi Colonel Fakhri Hussein Jaber is in shock. His jaw drops, mouth gaping open as a strained moan leaves his throat. Despite the hot desert temperature his limbs feel cold. He cannot believe what he is seeing.

Eight F-16s painted sand-colored desert camouflage flying in a single-file attack formation at rooftop level hurtles over the outskirts of Baghdad from the southwest. They bank hard left, slicing white tendrils of vapor from their missile-clad wingtips in the evening air. One at a time they light their afterburners over the southern edge of the city. The crack of jet thunder makes people all over Baghdad glance upward to the sky. As the attacking pilots pull their side-sticks back the jets instantly vault upward into the clear evening blue on tails of orange fire.

Their wings wear the white roundel and blue Star of David. The Israelis are here.

The single file procession of ear-splitting jets reaches 5,000 feet, their tails to the sun and invisible from the ground in the blinding light for the moment. They roll heavily onto their backs, wings bloated with huge one-ton bombs. They pitch downward into a shallow dive and lazily tumble back to wings level. Then they each drop two Mark-84 delayed fuse 2,000-pound general purpose bombs on Iraq’s new industrial pride, the French-designed nuclear reactor at Osirak. The large round reactor dome is completely destroyed in only two minutes. Nothing else is touched.

And then they are gone.

Iraq’s own air defense gunners do the only collateral damage. They accidentally shoot one of their own anti-aircraft gun positions on the ground when they try to hit the last Israeli jet fleeing at low level as erupting explosions from the delayed fuses on the bombs shatter the nuclear dome. One French contractor from Air Liquide dies tragically in the air raid. Ten Iraqi soldiers are killed as well, although it is not known if their death was a result of the Israeli bombs.

Having recovered from his shocked surprise and weighed down by dread, the next day Colonel Fakhri Hussein Jaber is hanged in a public execution along with his fellow officers. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has them executed for incompetence while failing to defend the most important strategic target in the country. It was the big Iraqi hope for building a nuclear weapons program.

In a script that has played out before, and would repeat itself again and again, a foreign nation has attacked Iraq to destroy its Weapon of Mass Destruction (WMD) program. This time it is Israel, and this is Operation Opera, one of the most audacious airstrikes in the history of airpower on June 7, 1981. It compares in significance to the air attack on Pearl Harbor, the Doolittle Raid, the RAF’s dam buster attack and in an unusual way the nuclear strikes on Nagasaki and Hiroshima.

It is not the first time an audacious airstrike has been launched to destroy Iraq’s nuclear development program. The Iranians launched a similar strike only a few months earlier in September of 1980 but failed to achieve a tangible result, using two older McDonnell-Douglas F-4 Phantoms. The Iranian Phantoms missed the reactor dome with their bombs. Work on the Iraqi reactor supported by the French continued, this time with enhanced air defenses ringing the facility. It would not stop Israel from trying.

Operation Opera, sometimes also called Operation Babylon, holds a significant place in aerial combat history for many reasons. A few regard it as perhaps the most daring and significant air attack in history.

This was a spectacular combat debut for one of the most successful tactical aircraft ever built and still serving in front line service with many nations today. The early General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcons used in the raid were called the “F-16A Netz” or “Hawk” in Israeli service. These very same F-16As went on to build an illustrious legacy for Israel, downing an amazing 40 enemy aircraft in the first war with Lebanon the year after Operation Opera in 1982. The original F-16A Netz aircraft were only recently retired from Israeli service on Dec. 26, 2016. They are being sold to a private contract “red air” company to provide simulation of enemy forces for training of new combat aircrews, probably over the U.S. southwest. During the following decades U.S. Air Force F-16s would go on to drop thousands of tons of munitions in the region.

In the latest chapter the free Iraqi Air Force acquired the first of thirty-six F-16s in June of 2014. That same year a U.S. F-16 instructor pilot told us on condition of anonymity that the program to train Iraqi pilots to fly the F-16 at Tucson International Airport in Arizona was, “Going dismally, most of them [the Iraqi F-16 students] can barely fly.” But the free Iraqis went on to develop enough proficiency to use their F-16’s successfully in combat over Iraq beginning in September of 2015. Just recently the Iraqi Air Force received its fifth batch of four F-16IQ’s on March 24th of 2017 completing the full Iraqi 9th Fighter Squadron with all of its F-16s.







Operation Opera has its roots in traditional aerial bombing before the introduction of stealth and precision guided weapons. It also reached into the future because of its mission of ending the proliferation of WMDs in Iraq under Saddam Hussein. That same agenda would haunt every U.S. President since then and eventually compel George W. Bush to invade Iraq in March 2003. Operation Opera foreshadows U.S. doctrine with North Korea today, supporting a rising argument that the U.S. should follow Israel’s example with Iraq and destroy North Korea’s looming nuclear threat before it becomes too dangerous to challenge.

While Operation Opera earns its place in the lore of combat aviation it was, for the most part, a relatively conventional low-level interdiction air strike. One of several things that made Opera sensational was the audacity of Israel for launching the strike, an aggressive act that Israel would defend with vigor, the United Nations would condemn and then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan would shrug off in surprised but quiet admiration of Israel’s aggressiveness, daring and initiative.

Another thing that surprised observers including U.S. intelligence analysts was how the Israelis managed to complete the raid without aerial refueling and how they were able to infiltrate one of Iraq’s most heavily defended airspaces completely undetected in broad daylight. The answers to these questions are exceptional planning, vigorous espionage, incredible work on the part of the maintenance crews, support personnel and incredible airmanship for the strike pilots along with no small measure of good fortune for the Israelis.

It is interesting that the Israelis chose to use eight lightweight, single-engine F-16As as the bomb-carrying strike aircraft and assigned six of the heavier, twin engine F-15 “Baz” aircraft to fly combat air patrol over the mission. The F-15 would later be adapted into a dedicated strike fighter configuration that would have been better suited to a raid like Operation Opera.

Remarkably, 26 years later Israel would use this mission template again.

On Sept. 6, 2007 Israel would reverse the role of the same aircraft during Operation Orchard, an airstrike on a secret Syrian nuclear installation in the Deir ez-Zor area. In this later strike on a similar target, Israel would employ new F-15I Ra’am strike aircraft as bombers and use the latest precision guided air-to-ground weapons including Maverick missiles and laser-guided bombs. An Israeli special operations team infiltrated the area to provide initial reconnaissance, including radiological survey, and later provide target designation for the precision-guided weapons during the strike. The Syrian nuclear site was built with significant support and cooperation from the North Koreans, and ten North Korean workers were killed at Deir ez-Zor, Syria during the 2007 strike.

Aviation artist and historian Rick Herter of the U.S. traveled to Israel some time ago with a U.S. Air Force Major General. Herter was given unique access to the secretive Israeli Air Force, interfacing with the Israeli Air Force Chief of Staff to gain a detailed historical understanding of Israeli operations including Operation Opera. Following Herter’s trip to Israel he began to work closely with retired Israeli Air Force Colonel Ze’ev Raz who planned and commanded Operation Opera himself, flying one of the strike aircraft. Herter’s unique relationship with the man who planned and flew the mission gave him insights that lead to his painting of the mission, the only in flight image with historical and technical accuracy. Rick Herter’s painting, “Dropping The Hammer, Operation Opera” is used at the top of this article.

Jam Petrochem Complex Expanding Value Chain - Financial Tribune,"Tue, 13 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jaWFsdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvZW5lcmd5LzY2Mzg0L2phbS1wZXRyb2NoZW0tY29tcGxleC1leHBhbmRpbmctdmFsdWUtY2hhaW7SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In line with plans to complete the value chain in Jam Petrochemical Complex in the port city of Asalouyeh, Bushehr Province, the first development phase of an ABS/rubber production plant will go on stream by the end of the current fiscal year that ends next March, the JPC managing director said.

“Upon completion, the unit will produce 200,000 tons of Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer (ABS) as well as 60,000 tons of rubber,” Hossein Mirafzali was quoted as saying by ILNA on Tuesday.

ABS is a hard, heat-resistant engineering plastic that is widely used in housing appliances, pipe fittings and automotive interior parts.

Stressing the priority of the plan, Mirafzali noted that the contractor, Pad Jam Polymer Development Co. (PJPC), is expected to fully launch the plant by next March. Pointing to JPC’s other initiatives, he noted, “Constructing new ethylene production units, increasing exports as well as producing petrochemicals with higher value-added top the JPC agenda.”

According to the official, with stable supply of gas feedstock to the complex, 2.5 million tons of petrochemicals will be sold to domestic and international markets by the yearend. Commenting on the number of active cracking furnaces for ethylene production, Mirafzali said, “Presently four furnaces are up and running. Nonetheless, if we get more feedstock, two more furnaces will become operational which means a notable increase in ethylene output.” Concerted efforts are being made to boost JPC’s high-density polyethylene (HDPE) output capacity. The polymer is used in the production of plastic bottles, corrosion-resistant piping, geomembranes and plastic lumber.

Talks With Internationals

According to Ebrahim Yousefzadegan, production manager of Parsian Oil and Gas Development Co., negotiations are underway with an unnamed Japanese firm to transfer technology to produce ethylene glycol using advanced methods.

“Traditionally the commodity is produced from ethylene, but new technology will help us produce ethylene glycol from natural gas, which will be much more cost-effective. This will allow us to use ethylene to produce petrochemicals with higher value-added,” he said.

Ali Mohammad Bosaqzadeh, a deputy director at the state-owned National Petrochemical Company, said that talks are being held with France’s Air Liquide global E&C Solutions (formerly Lurgy GmbH) on construction of a polypropylene production plant.

“To complete the value chain of the petrochemical industry, NPC has set a tight schedule, that entails cooperation between Air Liquide and Iran’s Petrochemical Research and Technology Company in building a polypropylene unit in Iran,” Bosaqzadeh noted.

Air Liquide is an engineering, construction and chemical process licensing company. Since 2007, it has been part of Air Liquide S. A., a multinational company which supplies industrial gases and services to industries. The company’s operations range from providing technology and services in petrochemical and refining sectors to renewable energies.

According to Bosaqzadeh, this would be the first time that the French multinational would embark on a joint venture with Iran for polypropylene production."
Sisecam's Tunc Goruney wins Furnace Solutions award - Glass International,"Tue, 13 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdsYXNzLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwuY29tL25ld3Mvc2lzZWNhbXMtdHVuYy1nb3J1bmV5LXdpbnMtZnVybmFjZS1zb2x1dGlvbnMtYXdhcmTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sisecam’s Tunc Goruney won the Michael Garvey award for best paper at last week’s Furnace Solutions conference.

Mr Goruney’s paper, titled Pushing the Envelope of Waste Heat Recovery in Oxy-fuel Tableware Furnaces, outlined a project at Sisecam Pasabahce's 200 tonne per day furnace in Targovishte, Bulgaria.

Mr Goruney, a Corporate Energy and Environmental Manager at Turkey's Sisecam group, discussed waste heat recovery from an oxy-fuel furnace via the implementation of reactant preheating technology.

The technology has already been validated by several applications to extend the benefits of oxy-fuel combustion in tableware and float furnaces.

Mr Goruney reported up to 8% natural gas savings compared to an oxy-fuel furnace and in excess of a 90% NOx reduction compared to an end-fired regenerative air-fuel furnace.

The project was co-funded by a €1.7 million grant from the European Commission LIFE programme and also included a technology partner, Air Liquide.

Michael Garvey was a former Guardian Glass engineer who tragically died in a climbing accident just days after the 2008 Furnace Solutions event.

The conference had started with a joint-presentation from Dr Richard Hulme of Guardian Glass and Dr Nick Kirk of Glass Technology Services (GTS). They spoke about the Glass Futures project in the UK, which is a not for profit organisation created and owned by the glass community.

The £20 million project will be based at the Magna site in Rotherham, UK, due to open late next year.

“It is a global platform for growth, innovation and training for the whole glass community,” said Dr Kirk. “It is an ambitious project that is making progress,” he added.

Dr Hulme said the project was for the industry by the industry. It would provide the glass industry with an opportunity to try out new ideas without risk to production.

He said: “In many ways Glass Futures is an extension of the Society of Glass Technology itself. We want people to talk together and discuss common problems and find common solutions. They can compete in the marketplace on service and price, but can sort out the technology and the science together.”

There were 11 papers throughout the day-long conference, each of 30 minutes duration.

Speakers included Yakup Bayram of PaneraTech, Christoph Jatzwauk of Horn and Electroglass Managing Director, Richard Stormont.

More than 100 people attended the event held in Lucideon, Stoke-on-Trent, UK, and which included a training day before the conference.

Delegates were from a variety of furnace suppliers and glass manufacturers and included companies such as Parkinson Spencer Refractories, Teco, Zippe, Fives Stein, Drujba Glassworks, Beatson Clark, Allied Glass, Bormioli Luigi, Guardian Glass, Nippon Electric Glass and Ardagh Glass.

A full review of the event will be published in the next issue of Glass International.

"Linde, Praxair agree on merger to create global gases leader - 台北時報","Sat, 03 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhaXBlaXRpbWVzLmNvbS9OZXdzL2Jpei9hcmNoaXZlcy8yMDE3LzA2LzAzLzIwMDM2NzE3OTfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Linde, Praxair agree on merger to create global gases leader

Reuters, FRANKFURT and MUNICH, Germany





The boards of Linde AG and Praxair Inc on Thursday voted to merge, creating a US$73 billion global industrial gases leader in what is likely to be the last in a wave of combinations that has resulted in a highly consolidated market.

The deal combines US firm Praxair’s operational efficiency and strength in the Americas with the leading technology of Germany’s Linde and its strong presence in Europe and Asia, overtaking main competitor France’s Air Liquide SA.

News of the merger, which would reunite a global Linde group that was split a century ago by World War I, sent Praxair shares in the US to a record high. The stock closed up 1.4 percent at US$134.09.

The all-share merger of equals, which still has to be approved by a majority of Praxair’s shareholders, represents a triumph for Linde’s Wolfgang Reitzle, a former CEO who returned as chairman to seal the deal.

Linde’s shareholders will not vote on the deal, but 75 percent must tender their shares to the new company for the deal to go through.

Reitzle, who effectively discarded Linde’s former CEO and finance chief to push through the merger after a failed attempt last year, was spared from having to use his casting vote as chairman when labor opposition crumbled at the last minute — as reported by Reuters on Wednesday.

Labor delegates, who enjoy equal representation with shareholder delegates under German law on Linde’s supervisory board, had threatened to scupper the deal, but in the end were divided by German job guarantees conditional on the merger.

Linde’s supervisory board voted six to five in favor of the merger, with one labor representative abstaining, four sources familiar with the matter said.

The new holding company will be incorporated in Ireland — where workers do not have the codetermination rights that they do in Germany over company strategy.

Most governance activities, including board meetings, will take place in Britain.

The companies raised their cost-savings target from the merger to US$1.2 billion from US$1 billion within three years — including efficiency programs already initiated.

The deal is expected to close in the second half of next year, the two companies said.

Reitzle is to become chairman of the merged company, while Praxair CEO Steve Angel will be chief executive.

Linde shareholders are to be offered 1.54 shares in the new company for every Linde share they hold, while Praxair shareholders are to be offered 1 for 1 — leading to a roughly 50:50 ownership split."

Linde-Praxair deal to stir industrial gases space in India - DNA India,"Mon, 05 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRuYWluZGlhLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9yZXBvcnQtbGluZGUtcHJheGFpci1kZWFsLXRvLXN0aXItaW5kdXN0cmlhbC1nYXNlcy1zcGFjZS1pbi1pbmRpYS0yNDYxNTg30gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZG5haW5kaWEuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL3JlcG9ydC1saW5kZS1wcmF4YWlyLWRlYWwtdG8tc3Rpci1pbmR1c3RyaWFsLWdhc2VzLXNwYWNlLWluLWluZGlhLTI0NjE1ODcvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Linde-Praxair deal to stir industrial gases space in India

So far, the rivals were competing to get business from firms like Tata Steel and SAIL; post merger, the new entity would have greater bargaining power

As Germany's Linde and US-based Praxair, two of the largest global players in industrial gases space, firm up their $35 billion merger proposal, there could be implications on the Indian market, the biggest chunk of which is with these companies. Linde even has a listed entity in the country.

Industrial gas producers play a key role in diverse and important sectors from steel to healthcare, with portable oxygen cylinders being one of the retail consumer-facing products.

Globally, as well as in India, the merger of Praxair and Linde would significantly influence their combined customer base and the merged entity might have to sell some assets.

""The executive Board of Linde AG signed a legally binding business combination agreement with Praxair Inc governing the terms and conditions of a merger of equals between the two companies. The agreement provides for a combination of the businesses under a publicly traded new holding company, which will bear the Linde name,"" Linde India has said in a statement.

Global industrial and medical gases market is controlled by the trio of Linde, Praxair and France's Air Liquide and the deal would effectively create a competition between two unequals and lead to anti-trust issues in several markets including Asia where Linde has a strong presence.

""The deal would present some significant anti-trust issues in some regions and countries around the world. Linde would have gas sales of around $16 billion worldwide compared to Praxair's $10 billion. Combined, this would give them 33% market share,"" James Barr, business analyst with Gasworld said in a report, adding that there would be divestments in North America, parts of South America, in Europe and also in Asia to fulfill anti-trust concerns.

In India, Linde and Praxair have been competing with each other to get businesses from customers like Tata Steel and SAIL, among others. Post merger, the combined entity would have greater bargaining power and would help Linde maintain topline as well as profitability at a time of slowdown in the core sector.

The combined entity would also be able to take on rival Air Liquide, which had earlier grown bigger by taking over Airgas Inc last year.

Apart from these three major global entities, there are several smaller domestic players in the Indian market like Inox Air Products, Bhuruka Gases, Bombay Oxygen Corp, Southern Gas, Sicgil India and Ellenbarrie Industrial Gases.

In the quarter ended March 2017, Linde's profits fell sharply to Rs 1.36 crore from Rs 8.50 crore in the year-ago period even as its turnover rose to Rs 55.80 crore from Rs 45.30 crore.

""With capital investment cycle taking a pause, we are eyeing opportunities in areas like food preservation and bringing in newer technologies for medical gases. But I expect investments to pick up again,"" managing director Moloy Banerjee had earlier told DNA Money.

According to a recent report by Research and Markets, industrial gases market in India is expected to witness double-digit growth on the back of growing demand from metal industries. ""Regular capacity expansion by automobile, refinery and chemical industries is augmenting demand for industrial gases in the country.

Monika Kruse's Anthems From Munich's '90s Techno Temple | Telekom Electronic Beats - Electronic Beats,"Thu, 15 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsZWN0cm9uaWNiZWF0cy5uZXQvYW50aGVtcy1mcm9tLXVsdHJhc2NoYWxsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Munich’s Ultraschall was one of the most important techno clubs in Germany during the years it was active. Its first incarnation—which was located in the kitchen of a cafeteria at the disused Munich-Riem airport—was founded in 1994 by Dorothea Zenker, Peter Wacha (aka DJ Upstart) and David Süss. Despite this peculiar and remote location, the club became a great success. Nevertheless, it had to close in 1996 because the airport had to be demolished to make room for the city’s Messestadt Riem project. So the team installed a second Ultraschall later that year in a similarly exotic but bigger location: a former factory area of a potato product manufacturer. Although that version was also successful, it too had to close—this time due to unresolved negotiations over a renewed lease in 2003. The team behind Ultraschall then split up to run their own clubs, which dominated the next phase of Munich club culture: Harry Klein and Rote Sonne.

For nine turbulent years, the club served as the nucleus and playground for what was dubbed “the new sound of Munich,” and it was instrumental in catapulting resident DJs like Richard Bartz, DJ Hell and Monika Kruse to international underground stardom. We asked one of those regulars, Monika Kruse, to tell the story of the clubbing institution in ten tracks.

Air Liquide, “Liquid Air” (Blue 1992)

“Air Liquide were booked often in the first Ultraschall to play live. They were almost part of the family. The track ‘Liquid Air’ was not a big hit by all means—not that tracks needed to be hits in order to get played at Ultraschall. It very adequately reflects both their sound, which combined techno and acid psychedelia with ambient, and the sound and feel of the club in the early years. It was all pretty trippy, to say the least.”

Robert Armani, “Circus Bells (Hardfloor Remix)” (Djax-Up-Beats 1993)

“Acid played an important role at Ultraschall, but even more important was the sound of Chicago and Detroit. Enter Djax-Up-Beats, which was one of the key labels back then. Miss Djax’s label successfully managed to bridge European techno with the tracky roughness from the original sources in Chicago and Detroit. I absolutely loved the Hardfloor remix of ‘Circus Bells’. It represented both the American and European sound perfectly.”

Sluts’n’Strings & 909, “Summerbreeze” (Loriz Sounds 1993)

“There was a vital exchange between Viennese artists—mostly from the Cheap label posse—and the Munich label Disko B, which was operated by one of the Ultraschall owners, DJ Upstart. He booked artists from Cheap like Patrick Pulsinger, and we headed over for Disko B label nights in Austria. When the Austrians played at Ultraschall, there were always elements of surprise between morbid music, serious techno or the occasional house track. This ‘anything goes’ attitude within the Austrian sound was very close to the spirit of Ultraschall.”

K-Hand, “Global Warning” (Warp 1994)

“This one is intense. I always got goosebumps when I played it. Many artists from Detroit were booked then. Jeff Mills played the opening night, for example. Among regular guests were also Underground Resistance, Juan Atkins, Blake Baxter and K-Hand. For me, ‘Global Warning’ is a very emotional track. It has this dark intensity mixed with the funkiness of most techno tracks that came out of Detroit back then.”

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7eRAuD7qZs

DBX, “Losing Control” (Accelerate 1994)

“This track illustrates the overall feeling we had at Ultraschall: ‘I am losing control.’ DJs played in the toilet facilities; Robert Görl of DAF once performed a ten-hour live set at the entrance door; Matthew Hebert sampled crisp packets for his live set; there was huge bed in the middle of the dance floor on an ambient-themed weekend. There was something happening every weekend, and DJs and guests shared the feeling of being completely detached from reality, losing control of everyday life. And thus the track fit extremely well, of course!”

Dopplereffekt, “Pornoactress” (Dataphysix Engineering 1996)

“‘Pornoactress’ was just a really great track that a lot of us played often. Electro always had its place at both Ultraschall incarnations—but at Ultraschall 2 it became in some sense poppier. You could also say that of the development of the club’s sound in general. Dopplereffekt was a perfect example of that, as was DJ Hell’s International Deejay Gigolo label, which he started around the same time Ultraschall 2 opened. Back then there was a lot of electro or electro boogie on the playlist, as well as the occasional drum & bass track.”

I-F, “Space Invaders Are Smoking Grass” (Viewlexx 1997)

“Ultraschall was always very open for all kinds of musical styles. We resident DJs like Captain Reality, Lester Jones, DJ Hell, Barbara Preisinger and I all had our own individual sounds. The guest DJs defined the sound of the club even more. Viewlexx and I-F in particular became a strong presence at Ultraschall 2. The club’s co-owner, Upstart, even released the first two I-F albums on Disko B, which label was basically an extension of the club. In that sense Ultraschall opened a lot of doors for a lot of DJs, producers and labels, who in turn were pretty instrumental in creating the overall experience.”

Grungerman, “Fackeln Im Sturm” (Profan 1997)

“Ultraschall loved Cologne humor and its DJ and producer scene, but I would not claim that of the Munich techno scene in general. The first Ultraschall always was an island. The club was like its location in the airport outside of Munich: off the beaten track. The club, its sound and its regulars were somehow not like Munich; a bit more to the left politically; alternative; punkish; crazy. Cologne artists like Mike Ink, Michael Mayer, Burger and Reinhardt Voigt were very welcomed guests, and their tracks were often played.”

Richard Bartz, “Ghettoblaster” (Kurbel 1997)

“I think Richard Bartz had already snuck into the club when he was 17, and he was definitely inspired by the Ultraschall experience and the ferocity and leeway it offered. As he later released on Disko B and became producer for DJ Hell, he also surely became a very influential figure in shaping the Ultraschall sound. It was not easy to choose only one of his tracks. I went with ‘Ghettoblaster’ since it has a catchy undercurrent rooted in house that you don’t really find in many of his tracks—especially not in his early stuff as Acid Scout. ‘Ghettoblaster’ was a big favorite with us residents, and it was pretty much on heavy rotation.”

Johannes Heil, “Paranoid Dancer (DJ Hell Remix)” (Kanzleramt 2002)

“I chose this track because it perfectly summarized the former sound of DJ Hell and Johannes Heil and because it illustrates the techno feeling of the last Ultraschall years very well. It was a bit sinister, as we were all a bit paranoid in Munich then because the second Ultraschall had opened right in the center of the city. Whereas before Ultraschall 1 was a bit outside on the periphery of the city, where we pretty much ran wild, unattended. It was different after the club moved. There were lots of other (non-techno) clubs on the same premise, which was called Kunstpark Ost, and it was monitored more heavily by the police, who didn’t handle us ravers with kid gloves. And you also suddenly had to deal with all these ‘normal’ people on the way to the club, which I found stressful at times and which was another reason why ‘Paranoid Dancer’ fitted so well.”

"Le Qatar ferme ses usines d'hélium, Air Liquide premier impacté - le1.ma","Tue, 13 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlMS5tYS9sZS1xYXRhci1mZXJtZS1zZXMtdXNpbmVzLWRoZWxpdW0tYWlyLWxpcXVpZGUtcHJlbWllci1pbXBhY3RlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Le Qatar, deuxième producteur d’hélium au monde, a décidé, ce mardi, de fermer ses deux usines de ce gaz rare et noble en raison du blocus économique qui lui a été imposé par l’Arabie saoudite, les Émirats arabes unis, le Bahreïn et l’Egypte.

Les usines d’hélium exploitées par RasGas, une filiale du Qatar Petroleum, appartenant à l’État, ont été fermées en raison de la fermeture des frontières par l’Arabie Saoudite, bloquant ainsi les exportations terrestres du gaz, a déclaré un responsable de Qatar Petroleum à Reuters.

En 2013, le Qatar avait mis en service, en partenariat avec le français Air Liquide, la plus grande unité de purification et de liquéfaction d’hélium du monde, basée dans la zone industrielle de Ras Laffan. Cette deuxième unité a porté la capacité de production annuelle du pays à d’environ 2 milliards de mètre cubes d’hélium liquide et peuvent répondre à environ 32% de la demande mondiale totale de gaz, selon le site web de RasGas.

Avec le projet «Helium 2» lancé en mai 2010, second projet d’hélium mené au pays, le Qatar avait pour objectif de garantir une plus grande stabilité du marché de l’hélium qui fait face à une demande mondiale accrue.

L’hélium joue un rôle essentiel dans un grand nombre d’applications : l’imagerie par résonance magnétique (IRM), les semi-conducteurs, les câbles en fibre optique, l’exploration spatiale, la recherche scientifique, la production d’airbags et la plongée sous-marine professionnelle.

Air Liquide et le japonais Iwatani les plus impactés

Cette décision d’arrêt des deux usines du pays, les spécialistes du secteur prévoient une forte instabilité des marchés mondiaux de l’hélium qui connaîtront inévitablement une pénurie temporaire d’approvisionnement si le blocus n’est pas levé très rapidement. Parmi les premiers touchés par cette crise figurent le français Air Liquide et le japonais Iwatani.

En effet, en investissant massivement dans le projet He2 qatari, avec des unités de productions livrées clés-en main et en signant une contrat à long terme d’acquisition de 50% de la production de l’hélium du Qatar, le français Air Liquide semble être le plus impacté par cette crise majeure.

Par ailleurs, la compagnie Iwatani, cotée au Nikkei, qui détient 50% de part de marché de l’hélium au Japon, a vu ses approvisionnements du Qatar stoppés net. Le fournisseur de gaz industriel japonais affirme qu’il dispose d’un mois de stock de sécurité. L’hélium extrait au Qatar est transporté sous forme liquide par l’Arabie saoudite pour atteindre un port dans les Émirats arabes unis, où le gaz est expédié au Japon. Mais le blocus imposé au Qatar par ces deux pays empêche Iwatani d’utiliser cette voie d’approvisionnement.

Le Japon avait l’habitude de se procurer plus de 90% de son hélium des États-Unis jusqu’à ce que les stocks commencent à diminuer vers 2010. Année à partir de laquelle Iwatani a commencé à importer davantage du Qatar avant d’investir dans des concessions en 2013 pour arriver à produire plus de 8 millions de m3 d’hélium dans le pays.

Un projet d'usine d'hydrogène vert à Port-Jérôme - L'Usine Nouvelle,"Tue, 06 Jun 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzaW5lbm91dmVsbGUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvdW4tcHJvamV0LWQtdXNpbmUtZC1oeWRyb2dlbmUtdmVydC1hLXBvcnQtamVyb21lLk41NDkzNTjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"La société H2V Product, filiale de la société d’investissement Samfi Invest installée à Caen (Calvados), a annoncé mardi 6 juin à Lillebonne (Seine-Maritime) son intention d’acquérir 27 hectares sur la zone pétrochimique de Port-Jérôme-sur-Seine (Seine-Maritime) pour construire et exploiter une usine de production d’hydrogène ""vert"".

L’usine qui sera voisine des installations d’Air Liquide, représente un investissement prévisionnel de 450 millions d’euros, a indiqué Lucien Mallet, le président de H2V Product et fondateur d’Eole-RES. Elle devrait employer à terme 180 salariés et pourrait être opérationnelle en 2022 si l’Etat accorde les décrets d’application requis pour la fabrication de méthane en France. Lucien Mallet a évoqué l’hypothèse d’un doublement de l’usine d’ici 2030 avec 500 emplois.

L’usine produira de l’hydrogène ""vert"" par électrolyse de l’eau moyennant une grosse consommation d’électricité (puissance nécessaire 500 MW) mais sans CO2, par opposition à l’hydrogène ""gris"" obtenu par reformage du méthane à la vapeur avec un coût énergétique plus faible et une production importante de CO2.

Combiné à du CO2 – acheté à Air Liquide – l’hydrogène ""vert"" produit par H2V Product donnera du méthane (CH4) qu’H2V Product vendra à des clients industriels. L’usine devrait utiliser et transformer environ 100 000 tonnes de CO2 par an et commercialiser environ 435 000 MWh de méthane.

Electrolyseurs achetés en Norvège

""L’hydrogène ""gris"" est arrivé sur le marché il y a 40 ans ; il n’est pas cher actuellement mais la taxation du CO2 va lui faire perdre son avantage en termes de prix, explique Lucien Mallet. La taxe sur le carbone va amener les pétroliers et les raffineurs à acheter des produits moins polluants.""

La nouvelle usine sera financée par Samfi Invest qui dispose de 120 millions d’euros d’actifs industriels et a développé à ce jour 1000 MW dans l’éolien. ""Le projet d’usine d’hydrogène vert sera financé sur fonds propres et endettement. Il devrait s’amortir sur vingt ans"", a expliqué Alain Samson, le président-fondateur de Samfi Invest et, par ailleurs, Pdg du groupe de transport Malherbe de Caen. La moitié de l’investissement va concerner l’outil de production et en particulier le parc de d’électrolyseurs qui sera acheté à un fabricant norvégien, l’autre moitié de l’investissement portera sur le poste électrique et les infrastructures d’injection de gaz.

Pour ce projet d’usine d’hydrogène Vert, H2V Product a reçu le soutien de la communauté d’agglomération Caux Seine Agglo et de l’Agence de développement de la région Normandie.

Au-delà de l’usine de Port-Jérôme-sur-Seine, l’objectif de H2V Product est ""d’équiper l’ensemble du territoire national en usines d’hydrogène vert"", soit six autres projets d’usine, dont une à Dunkerque (Nord). ""Notre ambition est d’avoir sept usines sur le territoire français, pas dans la pampa, mais dans des zones où l’on produit de l’essence"", ont expliqué Lucien Mallet et Alain Samson.

Les dirigeants des Transports Barré ont tenu à marquer l’événement sur le site lorrain (à Ludres, 54) de Via Location, auprès de qui ils louent leurs véhicules. C’était le 19 mai dernier. Ils se sont ainsi vu remettre les clés de 10 Stralis Iveco 400 ch au GNL. Ces tracteurs disposent d’une autonomie pouvant courir jusqu’à 1 200 km.

Moins de recours à la sous-traitance

L’acquisition s’inscrit dans le cadre d’une extension de parc pour cause

""de volumes en hausse et de diminution du recours à la sous-

traitance"", selon Ludovic Patout, directeur de l’agence Transfret à Velaine-en-Haye (54), l’une des entités de ce groupe dirigé par Bernard Chauve, le principal actionnaire.

L’inauguration a été l’occasion pour Via Location d’inviter des transporteurs clients afin de les sensibiliser aux vertus du gaz et de leur présenter la démarche des Transports Barré ainsi que la technologie GNL (gaz naturel liquéfié). Pour l’heure, l’avitaillement des véhicules s’effectue auprès de la station Air liquide, qui a été inaugurée l’an dernier à Fléville-les-Nancy.

Des stations d’avitaillement sur ses propres sites

La direction des Transports Barré a entamé des discussions avec un fournisseur de gaz dans la perspective d’installer des stations d’avitaillement sur ses propres sites. Il est question de Chalon-sur-Saône, où le groupe exploite en propriété les Transports Fartrans, de Valette (près de Nantes), siège des Transports Barré, et de Sablé-sur-Sarthe où est implanté un entrepôt logistique sous température dirigée et d’où sont opérées des lignes vers la région parisienne.

70 véhicules au GNL à l’horizon 2018

""L’idée est d’en avoir une utilisation privée au départ puis de les ouvrir aux transporteurs dans un second temps"", déclare Ludovic Patout. Lequel annonce que ""le groupe ambitionne de disposer de 70 véhicules au GNL à l’horizon 2018"".

Transfret est présent dans le bâché, le fourgon et le frigo ; Barré et Fartrans sont principalement acteurs dans le frigo. L’ensemble du groupe représente un chiffre d'affaires de 40 M€. Il emploie un effectif de 250 salariés et possède 500 cartes grises en portefeuille."

Jusqu’ici exclusivement constitué de Hyundai iX35 Fuel-Cell, Hype diversifie son offre et vient d’accueillir ses trois premières Toyota Mirai. Pour le service parisien, lancé en décembre 2015 par la Société du Taxi Electrique Parisien (STEP) en partenariat avec Air Liquide qui met une station à disposition au niveau du Pont de l’Alma, il s’agit de faire monter en puissance sa flotte. D’ici à la fin de l’année, la STEP espère pouvoir compter une centaine de taxis à hydrogène contre un peu moins d’une vingtaine actuellement.

Au niveau européen, l’acquisition de ces trois nouveaux véhicules a été financée par le programme Horizon 2020 dans le cadre du projet Hydrogen Mobility Europe 2 dont la STEP fait partie intégrante.

Pour Toyota, cette livraison à la STEP porte à six le nombre de Mirai livrées en France depuis le début de l’année, une autre ayant été livrée à Plastic Omnium et deux autres aux groupe ENGIE.

Vendue près de 70.000 euros, la Mirai peut embarquer jusqu’à 5 kilos d’hydrogène à 700 bars et dispose de 500 kilomètres d’autonomie. En Europe, son déploiement dépend de la « maturité » des marchés et notamment de la présence des indispensables stations de ravitaillement à hydrogène. A compter de 2020, l’ambition du constructeur est de parvenir à écouler annuellement quelque 30.000 unités à travers le monde."
