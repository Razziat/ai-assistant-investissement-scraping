Michael J. Graff of Air Liquide to Become New ACC Officer - American Chemistry Council,"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWVyaWNhbmNoZW1pc3RyeS5jb20vY2hlbWlzdHJ5LWluLWFtZXJpY2EvbmV3cy10cmVuZHMvcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZS8yMDIyL21pY2hhZWwtai1ncmFmZi1vZi1haXItbGlxdWlkZS10by1iZWNvbWUtbmV3LWFjYy1vZmZpY2Vy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PALM SPRINGS, Florida (October 28, 2022) – The American Chemistry Council (ACC) announced today at its board of directors meeting that Michael J. Graff, Chairman & CEO, American Air Liquide Holdings, Inc. and Executive Vice President of Air Liquide Group, will become the Council’s newest board officer, January 1, 2023.

“Mike brings more than 35 years of experience, but it’s his passion for sustainability and advancing the energy transition through innovative technologies like hydrogen that makes him an especially well-qualified candidate to help lead our Board,” said Chris Jahn, president and CEO of ACC. “Hydrogen holds great promise for solving the clean energy equation by helping to power the transportation sector and decarbonize hard-to- abate industrial sectors through the use of low-carbon and renewable hydrogen. As policymakers continue to eye more ways to accelerate the deployment of hydrogen-powered manufacturing processes in the U.S., Mike’s tenure as an ACC Board Officer will be critical to ushering in a lower-emissions future for our sector,” Jahn added.

“I’ve been honored to serve for several years as an executive committee member of ACC, and I’m looking forward to further supporting our Board as one of its officers,” said Mike Graff. “It’s clear that sustainability is foundational to the future of the ACC. I’m proud to bring Air Liquide’s commitment to hydrogen—and its ability to help us reach our environmental goals while supporting economic growth and the creation of hundreds of thousands of new jobs—to the broader ACC audience. While hydrogen alone will not drive a clean energy transition, a clean energy transition that ensures all Americans feel the impact of its benefits will not happen without hydrogen. At Air Liquide, for example, we are proud to employ over 20,000 U.S. employees and operate in all 50 states. Recently, we celebrated the grand opening of our largest liquid hydrogen production facility in the U.S., capable of producing 30 tons of liquid hydrogen per day and supplying renewable hydrogen to more than 40,000 fuel cell vehicles in California. Leveraging my experience in hydrogen project deployment and investment, I look forward to working with ACC and policymakers to bring a lower-emissions economy to life.”

“Mike’s commitment to performance improvement under Responsible Care®, his passion for sustainability, and his strategic focus are an asset to ACC’s Board,” said Karen McKee, President of ExxonMobil Product Solutions Company, and incoming Chairman of the ACC Board. “I look forward to having Mike serve our industry through this new leadership role.”

Following formal approval by the board of directors, Graff will first assume the role of Vice Chairman of the Board and chair of the Council’s Board Finance, Audit and Membership Committee. He’ll serve in this capacity for one year, followed by a one-year term each as Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chairman of the Board."
Aquaculture: learning to cultivate sustainability in water - Air Liquide,"Wed, 26 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvaW5kdXN0cnkvYXF1YWN1bHR1cmUtbGVhcm5pbmctY3VsdGl2YXRlLXN1c3RhaW5hYmlsaXR5LXdhdGVy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In a world where population and individual consumption continue to grow, aquaculture has sparked interest for the promise it holds for the world food transition. In fact, it’s the third year in a row that aquacultures’ global fish production overtakes that of fishing. So, what is aquaculture? How can it help the food industry become more sustainable? And how can Air Liquide be an active part of this effort?

Aquaculture at a glance

Aquaculture is the farming of aquatic plants and animals in natural or controlled conditions. It can refer alternatively to the farming of fish, seaweed, oysters, clams in brackish water, fresh water, or salt water in manufactured settings (ponds, pools) as well as natural ones (mariculture at sea).

This form of farming presents many advantages. A notable benefit is the feed conversion rate of fish: the weight of feed intake divided by weight gained by the animal. For example, 2.63 kg of feed is used to produce 1 kg of pork, while only 1.3 kg for the same weight of Atlantic salmon. In addition to this, aquatic cultures offer a better allocation of space thanks to three-dimensional stocking offered by water.

Environmentally, modern fish farms don’t impact ecosystems like intensive fishing. By being enclosed systems, they offer a lower risk of contamination with pharmaceuticals or pathogens to waterways. Water demand is also an environmental advantage with super intensive recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) where only 0.4% of the water is make-up water. Thus, as much as 99.6% of the water needed can be reused on site.

Room for improvement?

However, drawbacks are also significant, aquacultures have longer production cycles (1 to 3 years) and are prone to the fast spread of diseases and anoxia (the lack of oxygen) inside the farm and transferred with water into the environment. This is because aquatic environments have many parameters such as light, pH, flow, and temperature that can make their management very difficult. Based on RAS, Aqua4C is a brilliant example of how the traditional drawbacks of aquaculture can be subverted. This fish farm located in Kruisem, Belgium has rapidly evolved from a research project to a commercial one. Its particularity? It is the world’s most sustainable fish farm. Why? Because it farms one of the world’s most sustainable fish in the most sustainable way.

Air Liquide upgrades with cookie-cutter compressor monitoring - Control Global,"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb250cm9sZ2xvYmFsLmNvbS9ldmVudHMvZW1lcnNvbi11c2Vycy1leGNoYW5nZS0yMDIyL2FydGljbGUvMjE0MzcyMTMvZW1lcnNvbi1hdXRvbWF0aW9uLXNvbHV0aW9ucy1haXItbGlxdWlkZS11cGdyYWRlcy13aXRoLWNvb2tpZS1jdXR0ZXItY29tcHJlc3Nvci1tb25pdG9yaW5n0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It’s hard to overstate just how crucial vibration data is to maintaining Air Liquide’s compressors and ASUs, but it’s also costly to acquire this information.

“It may seem like air is the raw material in air separation, but it’s really the energy needed to compress air to the pressure needed for our processes,” explained Dupre. “We use centrifugal, multi-stage compressors with high-speed pinions, and we need to be aware of and measure vibrations of the bearings, seals and other areas to monitor, maintain and optimize performance. If an ASU trips, then our whole process goes down, and it’s costly to start up again. There are many advantages to good vibration monitoring.”

Dupre stated that extending its partnership with Emerson from process control into vibration monitoring provided several key benefits. These included:

unified product support from one supplier

commissioning synergies

cost savings by combining vibration racks with DeltaV in the same cabinets

one source for standardizing on vibration packages for all O 2 , H 2 , and N 2 compressors

, H , and N compressors improved availability and reliability of the compressors.

“The biggest gain to this approach was the visibility of these production machines at a corporate enterprise monitoring center and deployment of prescriptive analytics on all machines,” said Dupre. “The aim is to take this to a global level from our Houston and local, U.S.-based plants. We’re expecting to use Plantweb Optics software provide more machine visibility at the enterprise level.”

Standardize and save

As it sought a common upgrade strategy for the ASUs’ compressors, Dupre reported that AirLiquide, Puffer and Emerson developed a standardized solution. “It became like a cookie-cutter, which is what Air Liquide wanted to achieve,” said Dupre.

The company’s standard package for compressor vibration monitoring on its ASUs included AMS 6500 ATG racks; cabinets from Puffer; eddy current probes with EZ-1000 accelerometers from Emerson; and a network license for AMS Machine Works software, with a provision for increased capacity as more plants join the network.

So far, this vibration monitoring package with some variations has been installed on compressors at four Air Liquide facilities.

Three O 2 vertical reciprocating compressors are installed at its plant in Channelview, Texas. They have a two-throw configuration, use AMS 6500 ATGs and include three racks with seven channels per rack.

Two horizontal reciprocating compressors are in a hydrogen-carbon monoxide (HyCo) process at its plant in Freeport, Texas. One compressor has a six-throw configuration and the other has a four-throw configuration. They’re using two ATG racks.

Centrifugal N 2 compressors are at its plant in Longview, Texas. This application uses one ATG rack and employs 10 channels per compressor.

Seven N400A O 2 compressors are at its plant in Nederland, Texas. This is the largest upgrade project, which has 68 probes and six ATG racks, and it uses AMS Machine Works software, as well as Machine Studio software to configure the racks. It also employs Red Lion’s HMI displays, as well as Aveva’s PI Historian and Prism software.

“These are big projects, but our goal with all of them is to give our subject matter experts (SMEs) rotating equipment data from many facilities, so they can optimize them,” said Dupre. “Communications consist of OPC UA from fiber-optic to Ethernet switches that are linked to DeltaV and our plant networks, though this is all still at Level 1 of the Purdue OSI model. They bring in vibration and other data, such as showing latches. We can also see alarm limits and put in bypasses now without having to go out to the racks. We’re also getting better data to DeltaV from our devices, which we can see on our remote faceplates without physical visits. Eventually, we’ll be able to move this data up from Level 1 to other applications by using Plantweb Optics software.”

Just on the Nederland upgrade project, Dupre reported that Air Liquide estimates it saved $150,000 to $200,000 by unifying its vibration modernization and extending from DeltaV to other Emerson solutions. These savings included engineering expenses, design and documentation costs, training for global personnel, more efficient maintenance by more easily swapping uniform parts and reduced costs for spare components by using Universal Measurement cards that incorporate all major vibration measurements, instead of using one card for each function.

“We also achieved about 8.9% total and value-added savings by integrating our individual AMS 6500 ATG and DeltaV panels into one cabinet with help from Puffer,” concludes Dupre. “In fact, we’re already planning to upgrade another seven racks at our plant in Baytown, Texas, in the second quarter of next year.”"
Air Liquide to design cryogenic tanks for Vega-E space launcher - gasworld,"Fri, 07 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdhc3dvcmxkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9haXItbGlxdWlkZS10by1kZXNpZ24tY3J5b2dlbmljLXRhbmtzLWZvci12ZWdhLWUtc3BhY2UtbGF1bmNoZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide to design cryogenic tanks for Vega-E space launcher

Air Liquide is advancing space exploration having signed a contract with space propulsion expert Avio to design the new generation of cryogenic tanks for the upper stage of the future Vega-E launcher, a project coordinated by the European Space Agency (ESA).

The launcher will use cryogenic tanks filled with a mixture of oxygen stored at -182C and methane stored at -161C to act as propellant for the oxygen-methane engine.

Earlier this year, Avio successfully carried out the first test of its new M10 liquid oxygen-liquid/methane engine, which will be used to power the launcher.

A key part of the new launcher’s development, the engine will provide ten tonnes of thrust and is manufactured with extensive use of additive layer manufacturing technologies."

The facility could support industrial decarbonization and mobility applications in the region and expand clean ammonia exports, helping to increase the supply of lower carbon power internationally.

The potential project to be studied is intended to cover the end-to-end, energy value chain, utilizing each participant’s technical expertise in production, operational experience, storage, distribution, and export logistics. Collectively, the consortium will bring capabilities and expertise in air separation technology, hydrogen technologies, lower carbon intensity and renewable natural gas, carbon capture and storage (CCS), electrolysis-based technologies, and petrochemicals.

Specifically, the consortium will assess the potential for producing hydrogen using natural gas with CCS and renewable hydrogen via electrolysis to supply end-use markets, including the ammonia, petrochemicals, power, and mobility markets.

If development proceeds, the project could leverage existing advantages along the Gulf Coast, including pipeline infrastructure, to supply lower carbon and renewable hydrogen to local industrial clusters. Likewise, ammonia infrastructure could support exports to both Europe and the Asia Pacific region.

Adam Peters, CEO of Air Liquide North America, said: “Air Liquide is proud to evaluate, with its customers and industry partners, opportunities to further develop and deploy low-carbon and renewable hydrogen, and carbon capture technologies in the region. The Gulf Coast is the ideal location to model hydrogen and carbon capture technologies as immediate pathways to decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors. This project exemplifies Air Liquide’s commitment to decarbonizing industrial basins around the world. Prioritizing sustainable technologies, like hydrogen and carbon capture, means we can provide energy transition careers for many thousands of American workers while building a more sustainable energy future for all.”

Austin Knight, Vice President of Hydrogen, Chevron New Energies, said: “Across the value chain, collaborations are critical to developing a hydrogen ecosystem, and this is an example of bringing together leaders in the space to explore lower carbon hydrogen opportunities and to contribute complementary expertise. We are seeking to accelerate the deployment of lower carbon solutions and believe companies like Chevron can help bring the capabilities needed to make this a reality. We are excited to be a part of this effort.”

Aaron Ledet, Senior Vice President, Olefins and Polyolefins Americas of LyondellBasell, said: “While our products play an important role in helping to enable greenhouse gas emissions reductions through their use in renewable energy technologies, such as wind turbines, solar panels and electric batteries, we are also taking concrete steps to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from our operations. We look forward to collaborating with the members of this consortium to continue evaluating and advancing clean hydrogen as a potential solution for reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of our U.S. Gulf Coast manufacturing assets.”

Marc Merrill, President and CEO of Uniper in North America, said: “Uniper is very excited to collaborate with this unique group of companies to explore a truly transformative U.S. Gulf Coast hydrogen infrastructure project. We look forward to bringing the best of our U.S. business and global technical and commercial platforms to support this effort. Uniper is committed to the green expansion of our Wilhelmshaven LNG receiving terminal in Germany and expects to receive and store over 2 MTPA of clean ammonia at the port by the end of the decade. U.S. Gulf Coast supply from this initiative can be critical to meeting that goal.”

Third quarter 2022: Strong sales growth and solid investment momentum illustrating the resilience of the business model - Air Liquide,"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5haXJsaXF1aWRlLmNvbS9ncm91cC9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy1uZXdzLzIwMjItMTAtMjUvdGhpcmQtcXVhcnRlci0yMDIyLXN0cm9uZy1zYWxlcy1ncm93dGgtYW5kLXNvbGlkLWludmVzdG1lbnQtbW9tZW50dW0taWxsdXN0cmF0aW5nLXJlc2lsaWVuY2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Commenting on 3rd quarter sales for 2022, François Jackow, Chief Executive Officer of Air Liquide, stated:

“The Group maintained a strong growth momentum during the third quarter despite a complex macroeconomic environment. Revenue, at close to 8.3 billion euros, was up +8.3% on a comparable basis and up +41.3% on a published basis, demonstrating the robustness of Air Liquide’s business model in the context of a surge in energy prices. All activities improved: Gas & Services, Engineering & Construction and Global Markets & Technologies. Within Gas & Services, which accounts for 96% of sales, the business was driven in particular by the momentum of Electronics, the solid performance of Industrial Merchant and growth in Healthcare. In terms of geographies, activity was particularly strong in the Americas and Asia, and was more contrasted in Europe. The Group resolutely pursues its continuous performance improvement measures. Against a backdrop of high inflation, value creation and dynamic pricing management in Industrial Merchant allow the Group to recover the increase in costs while, in Large Industries, energy price increases are contractually passed on to customers. Operational efficiencies, in an inflationary context, stood at the very good level of 262 million euros over nine months. The business portfolio is actively managed. Cash flow remained high at 24%[1] of sales. 12-month investment opportunities remain high, at more than 3 billion euros. More than 40% are related to the energy transition. In this context, the Group has decided to invest 1.1 billion euros this quarter, notably in Electronics and in projects that contribute to the fight against climate change. The robust and diversified investment backlog[2], currently running at 3.4 billion euros, is particularly promising for future growth. With our clear strategic plan, ADVANCE, which further reinforces the resilience of its business model, for full year 2022, assuming no significant economic disruption, Air Liquide is confident in its ability to further increase its operating margin and to deliver recurring net profit growth, at constant exchange rates[3].”

awarded to Air Liquide by , the world’s largest provider of business sustainability ratings, . As of September 15, the Air Liquide Foundation has supported more than 35 associative projects, supervised by 15 Group subsidiaries, for the benefit of 60,000 refugees from Ukraine in 7 countries thanks to a financial donation of 700,000 euros.

Group revenue for the 3rd quarter of 2022 totaled 8,247 million euros, a strong growth of +8.3% on a comparable basis with the 3rd quarter of 2021. The Group’s revenue as published posted a significant increase of +41.3% in the 3rd quarter, with a record high energy impact of +24.4% as well as a favorable currency impact of +8.8%, while the significant scope impact was limited at -0.2%.

This performance was delivered in a challenging context of exceptionally high energy prices, strong inflation, strain on supply chains and the war in Ukraine. The Group benefited from a solid business model and diversity of business reach in terms of geographies, businesses, end-markets and customers which ensured a resilient performance and allowed the Group to take advantage of all growth opportunities. Its core positioning in growth markets of the future (in particular the energy transition, Semiconductors and Healthcare) reinforces these attributes.

Gas & Services revenue amounted to 7,897 million euros in the 3rd quarter of 2022, up by +7.2% on a comparable basis. As published revenue for Gas & Services increased by a significant +41.4% in the 3rd quarter, benefiting from a historically high energy impact (+25.6%) and a positive currency impact (+8.9%). The significant scope impact was limited (-0.3%).

Gas & Services revenue in the Americas totaled 2,936 million euros in the 3 rd quarter, representing a strong comparable growth of +12.8% . The Large Industries business (+5.7%) benefited from the ramp-up of new units and solid demand. In the Industrial Merchant business, sales increased by +16.5%, driven by the marked rise in prices and a raise in volumes, excluding helium. Healthcare revenue was up +4.5% due to dynamic activity in the Proximity Care business in the United States and the Home Healthcare business in Latin America, despite a strong decrease in volumes of medical oxygen for the treatment of covid-19 compared to 2021. A strong increase in Electronics sales (+10.3%) also contributed to the dynamic growth in the Americas.

Revenue in Europe was stable ( -0.2% ) at 3,266 million euros in the 3 rd quarter. Activity was contrasted from one business line to another. Large Industries was impacted by a slowing demand from Steel and Chemical customers but volumes showed a limited decrease in a context of soaring energy prices. The difference between comparable sales growth (-27.5%) and volume evolution (-6%) is due to a calculation effect of the energy impact. Indeed, for Large Industries, the method values the energy impact of the year on the basis of the volumes of the preceding year times the difference of energy prices. Consequently, in the 3 rd quarter, the rise in energy prices being exceptionally strong and volumes slightly down, the energy impact is amplified, as well as a combined effect, which reduced comparable sales of Large Industries. In Industrial Merchant, sales rose by more than +30%, with the pricing impact reaching a new record high of +29.9% and volumes remaining resilient. The Healthcare business saw strong growth of +5.8%, driven by dynamic Home Healthcare and despite a high basis of comparison due to the covid-19 pandemic in 2021.

Revenue in Asia Pacific rose by +10.9% on a comparable basis in the 3 rd quarter to 1,474 million euros . It benefited from particularly dynamic activity in the Electronics business (+21.8%). Large Industries sales grew by +3.1%, driven by China. Industrial Merchant revenue rose by +8.9%, benefiting from the acceleration of price increases.

Revenue in the Middle East and Africa slightly decreased by -1.2% to 221 million euros in the 3rd quarter. The Large Industries sales grew and those of the Industrial Merchant were impacted by small divestitures in the Middle East. In Healthcare, medical oxygen sales for the treatment of the covid-19 were lower than in 2021.

As in the 1st half-year, the two drivers for the 3rd quarter were the Industrial Merchant business, which grew very sharply by +18.0% on a comparable basis due to a record pricing impact and resilient volumes, and the Electronics business, which saw revenues climb by +20.9%. Large Industries sales were down by -10.4% with volumes decreasing by -2%, the gap being explained by an effect related to the calculation of the energy impact in a context of exceptionally strong increase of energy prices in Europe (see explanations above). A strong growth in the Americas, benefiting from unit ramp-ups, and a solid activity in Asia partially offset the slowing demand in Europe. Healthcare recorded robust growth (+4.5%), driven in particular by a dynamic Home Healthcare business and despite lower volumes of medical oxygen for the treatment of covid-19.

Consolidated revenue from Engineering & Construction totaled 115 million euros in the 3rd quarter, posting a comparable growth of +37.3% and reflecting the increase in order intake from third-party customers in recent quarters.

Global Markets & Technologies posted a sharp +32.7% increase in revenue to 235 million euros in the 3rd quarter. Biogas retained strong momentum and benefited from sales prices increase linked to the spike in energy price.

Prices in the Industrial Merchant activity rose sharply by +18.0% in the 3rd quarter, demonstrating the Group's ability to transfer the sharp rise in costs. Efficiencies amounted to 262 million euros over the first nine months of the year. In a context of high inflation, unfavorable to procurement efficiencies, limiting the cost increase remained a priority and increased focus was put on operational efficiencies. The portfolio management was particularly active with the integration of 12 acquisitions and the completion of 4 divestitures since the beginning of the year.

Cash flow from operating activities before changes in net working capital amounted to 4,569 million euros at the end of September 2022, a strong growth of + 23.5% in a context of high inflation, demonstrating the business model resilience. This corresponds to a high level of 23.8% of sales excluding energy impact.

Industrial and financial investment decisions reached a high level of 1,114 million euros in the 3rd quarter of 2022. They account for 2,910 million euros year to date compared with 2,302 million euros over the same period in 2021, excluding the acquisition of 16 Air Separation Units from Sasol in South Africa for approximately 480 million euros. The investment backlog was high at 3.4 billion euros.

The additional contribution to sales[4] of unit start-ups and ramp-ups totaled 288 million euros at the end of September. The contribution expected for 2022 is between 400 and 425 million euros, a slight decline of 10 million euros compared with previous estimates due to the deconsolidation of the Group’s subsidiary in Russia as of September 1st.

The 12-month portfolio of investment opportunities stood at more than 3.0 billion euros at the end of September 2022, driven by projects linked to the energy transition, which accounted for more than 40% of the portfolio.

Founding Story - Hydrogen Council,"Sun, 16 Oct 2022 05:54:07 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vaHlkcm9nZW5jb3VuY2lsLmNvbS9lbi9mb3VuZGluZy1zdG9yeS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“In the beginning there were 13 of us: 13 international business leaders who rallied at the World Economic Forum in January 2017,” Benoît Potier, founding co-chair of the Hydrogen Council (2017-2022) and Chairman of the Board of Directors, Air Liquide, said.

“We shared a common vision of the major role that hydrogen could play in bringing about a successful transition to a low-carbon society. This vision was not universally shared at the time. But we were determined to pursue it because we knew it was right.”

Although the Council was officially launched in January 2017, Air Liquide had in fact been working on the global initiative for longer than that. With the active support of Toyota, Air Liquide launched the Hydrogen Council in mid-2016. The initial goal was to unite the major stakeholders who think hydrogen is a global and trans-industrial solution to the energy challenge at the highest level.”

Other stakeholders, including Shell and Anglo American, were convinced to join the effort, and a ‘snowball’ effect quickly took hold. That is how the Hydrogen Council were able to make news by bringing together 13 business executives at Davos in January 2017.

Of course, hydrogen was not a new molecule for Air Liquide, which had been producing, transporting and delivering hydrogen to several industrial customers for 60 years.

Potier continued: “In light of this pioneering expertise, we were convinced that hydrogen had a key role to play in the transition to a low-carbon society. At the crossroads of several forms of energy, hydrogen was the missing piece in the energy transition puzzle. Over and above technological innovations and solutions, a new ecosystem, a hydrogen society, needed to be built.

“We knew that we could not do it alone. So, together, we created the Hydrogen Council.”

Through the Hydrogen Council, a unifying momentum to mobilize industry, investors and public decision-makers around a common goal was created.

Today, the results are there: the Hydrogen Council has become a force to be reckoned with. Its studies and reports are used as a reference by international institutions in the area of new energies. But, most importantly, its impact can be measured by the importance of hydrogen in post-Covid stimulus plans and government decarbonization strategies. Globally, 40 national hydrogen strategies have been announced, as countries set pathways to tap into hydrogen’s potential to decarbonize, ensure energy security, and spur sustainable economic growth from stranded energy resources. Hydrogen has really taken off. By 2050, it could account for up to 22% of total global energy demand.

“I believe this venture is a perfect illustration of the need for cooperation between stakeholders to meet a global challenge such as climate change. Through the Hydrogen Council, companies from a wide range of sectors – energy companies, hydrogen producers, equipment manufacturers, car manufacturers and many others – have demonstrated that they can work together towards a common goal.”"
CMA CGM comes onboard €2bn clean hydrogen infrastructure fund - Splash247 - Splash 247,"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vc3BsYXNoMjQ3LmNvbS9jbWEtY2dtLWNvbWVzLW9uYm9hcmQtZTJibi1jbGVhbi1oeWRyb2dlbi1pbmZyYXN0cnVjdHVyZS1mdW5kL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French carrier CMA CGM has joined what is said to be the world’s first and largest infrastructure fund to invest exclusively in the entire clean hydrogen value chain.

Fund manager Hy24 Partners, a joint venture between clean hydrogen investment firm FiveT Hydrogen and European private equity firm Ardian, has closed €2bn ($1.94bn) of allocations with CMA CGM as a new key industrial investor.

The fund, launched a year ago with a number of high-profile founding anchor investors such as Air Liquide, VINCI Concessions, TotalEnergies, Plug Power, Chart Industries and Baker Hughes, is focused on scaling up hydrogen technologies. It has also attracted more than 50 prominent investors from 13 countries, including Lotte Chemical, Airbus, Snam, AXA, Crédit Agricole Assurances and others.

The aim is to commit the €2bn fund capital within the next six years through a portfolio of projects across Europe, the Americas and Asia, with a focus on upstream projects such as renewable and low-carbon hydrogen production and downstream projects such as refuelling stations.

In addition, the fund closed with new key financial investors, Border to Coast Pensions Partnership, Nuveen, ERAFP, Groupama, Société Générale Assurances, BBVA and Norinchukin.

In 2020, CMA CGM joined forces with Energy Observer to make hydrogen one of the potential fuels. Earlier this year, the partners, including LMG Marin, Ayro, Air Liquide, and Bureau Veritas, took a new step forward by working together on a prototype intra-regional container ship fueled by liquid hydrogen.

The Marseille-based company in September announced a $1.5bn special fund for energies to support the industrial production of new fuels as well as low-emission mobility solutions across the group’s business base, including maritime, overland and air freight shipping; port and logistics services; and at its offices.

Cash-rich CMA CGM has also decided to spend some of its mega profits to equip over 270 ships with the container fire-fighting tool HydroPen, produced by Denmark-based Viking Life-Saving Equipment. Viking will also be supplying the same system to Maersk’s entire fleet."

Mars evangelist and SpaceX founder Elon Musk may soon have an easier time going green.

Green Hydrogen International (GHI), a Texas-based energy startup, announced plans last week to develop a brand-new green hydrogen project—the world’s largest—in South Texas. GHI says some of the hydrogen from this project will be used to develop clean rocket fuel for Elon Musk’s aerospace company SpaceX.

You love energy. So do we. Let’s nerd out over it together.

When completed, the staggering 60-gigawatt project—located near a hydrogen storage facility in Duval County, Texas—will produce over 2.5 billion kilograms of green hydrogen per year. (The largest green hydrogen plant in the world, Air Liquide’s 20-megawatt Bécancour facility in Quebec, Canada, produces just 300,000 kilograms of hydrogen per year.)

A mix of solar and wind energy will keep the facility’s lights on, and during low-price periods, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the state’s electrical grid, will also supply power.

As the saying goes, location is key. GHI is developing the site, dubbed “Hydrogen City,” due to its close proximity to the Piedras Pintas Salt Dome, which will be used to store the massive amounts of hydrogen produced there.

GHI will then pipe that hydrogen 90 miles east to Corpus Christi and to Brownsville, where SpaceX is headquartered, about 100 miles south of the hub. Additional pipelines are slated to carry hydrogen to other parts of

Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe—it makes up roughly 75 percent of all observable matter—and powers stars like our sun. Here on Earth, it is often heralded as a potential silver bullet in the fight against climate change.

But there have been recent doubts as to how “clean” this clean tech may be.

The current method used to produce the colorless gas, called the steam reforming process, harnesses high heat and pressure to pluck hydrogen from methane, leaving carbon dioxide as a byproduct, the New York Times explains.

The process, referred to as producing “gray” hydrogen, is incredibly energy intensive and releases large quantities of greenhouse gases into the air. Roughly ten kilograms of carbon dioxide are emitted per kilogram of gray hydrogen produced, J.D. Power reports.

The method used to produce what’s called “blue” hydrogen aims to clean up the steam reforming process by recapturing the emitted carbon dioxide and storing it in pockets of rock deep underground.

But in an August 2021 study published in the journal Energy Science & Engineering, researchers from Cornell and Stanford Universities suggested that the entire process used to develop blue hydrogen still generates roughly 20 percent more greenhouse gases than the simple act of burning natural gas.

But the industry is heading in the right direction. The production of so-called “green” hydrogen goes a step further, using renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, to power machines called electrolyzers, which separate hydrogen and oxygen atoms within water.

This process releases virtually no greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. And one estimate by the International Energy Agency suggests that the production of green hydrogen versus gray hydrogen could prevent as much as 830 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from escaping into the atmosphere annually.

Still, there are a few kinks to iron out first in order to get the green hydrogen industry off the ground. (The New York Times estimates that less than 5 percent of hydrogen produced today is considered “green” hydrogen.)

For example, the massive and costly electrolyzers needed to produce green hydrogen are few and far between due to the nature of their complex machinery, and storing and transporting the highly flammable and bulky gas is not an easy task. And in some places, there aren’t enough renewable energy sources to cover the cost of producing hydrogen.

Musk’s SpaceX is slated to become one of the first beneficiaries of GHI’s green hydrogen.

SpaceX currently uses a kerosene-based rocket fuel to power its Falcon 9 rockets. But the company’s Raptor engine—which is designed to someday send Starship to the moon and Mars—runs on a mixture of cryogenic liquid methane and liquid oxygen, or “methalox.”

In a March 3 statement, GHI said it is “looking at combining hydrogen with CO2 at the Port of Brownsville to create a green methane rocket fuel for launch operations in South Texas.”

In addition to fueling Musk’s rockets, GHI is looking into several other uses for its green hydrogen, like making a cleaner type of jet fuel, creating a “green” ammonia for use in fertilizers, and substituting for natural gas at some power plants.

The first phase of the project is expected to break ground in 2026, with the goal of generating two gigawatts of power and constructing two storage facilities within the salt dome. Ultimately, the company hopes to build 50 storage caverns within the salt dome.

Other green hydrogen projects on the docket include Western Australia’s Green Energy Hub, a 50-gigawatt wind and solar-powered green hydrogen plant, and SVEVIND Energy and Kazakh Invest National Company’s 45-gigawatt facility along the steppes of Kazakhstan.

Highlights:

Energy startup Green Hydrogen International (GHI) is planning to develop a new project based in South Texas.

The hub plans to supply billionaire Elon Musk’s SpaceX with green hydrogen for the rocket company’s methane-powered rocket engines.

Other uses for the abundant, colorless gas include adding it to ammonia for fertilizers and generating environmentally friendly jet fuels.
