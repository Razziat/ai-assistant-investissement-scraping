Gas manufacturer buys Kulp Foundry - Pocono Record,"Tue, 08 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvY29ub3JlY29yZC5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDE0LzA3LzA4L2dhcy1tYW51ZmFjdHVyZXItYnV5cy1rdWxwLWZvdW5kcnkvMzYzNTE1MDcwMDcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Gas manufacturer buys Kulp Foundry Lehigh Valley company pays $725,000, will make industrial specialty gases

The former Kulp Foundry on Mill Creek Road in Stroud Township was purchased last week and will be converted to an industrial gas manufacturing facility.

According to public records, the property was purchased by TCC Leasing LLC of Macungie on June 30 for $725,000.

Plans filed at Stroud Township say the property will be used by Complexx Gases.

The company will make and distribute industrial specialty gases used during the manufacture of electronic components, nanotechnology devices, photovoltaic devices and specialty polymers.

Efforts to contact Paul Murphy, owner of Complexx Gases, were unsuccessful.

Records show Murphy's name also listed at an address for TCC Leasing.

The Kulp Foundry has sat empty since 2006, when the business merged with Fairmount Foundry Inc. of Hamburg.

The Kulp Foundry had operated as a business for more than 60 years.

""The re-use of this property, for this particular use, there could not be a better fit,"" said Stroud Township Supervisor, Daryl Eppley.

Stroud Township supervisors granted conditional use for Complexx Gases earlier this year.

Complexx Gases would use the existing buildings on the Kulp Foundry's 21 acres.

According to the company's conditional use application: ""The facility will have a wide range of gases, from hydrocarbons to fluorinated carbon materials. The gases will fall into three classifications, non-flammable gas, flammable gas and inhalation hazard.""

As part of the conditional use approval, Complexx Gases will install a 6-foot-high chain-link security fence with barbed wire on top, as well as secured entrance gates around the perimeter of the property.

To further ensure the safety of the plant, Complexx Gases will be required to submit an annual compliance certification letter to the township by March 1 of every year.

The letter will show that the company is up to date on all necessary permits that may be required by agencies such as the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration.

The facility will be designed in compliance with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, DEP and Department of Homeland Security standards, says the application.

""Those gases classified as inhalation hazards will be stored in controlled areas, some of which will be closely monitored and vented to scrubbing systems to prevent discharge in the unlikely event of a cylinder leak,"" it says.

The company is expected to start with three employees, then eight by the end of the first year of operation, Eppley said.

Murphy has been part of the gas manufacturing industry for 32 years, starting a career at AirCo, now known as Linde Corp.

He then worked for American Air Liquide before starting his own business in the village of Palm in Montgomery County for about 15 years, Eppley said.

That business was later sold to Matheson Tri-Gas, a major industrial gas company.

In addition to Complexx Gases, Murphy is also listed as the CTO of Takachiho Chemical Industrial Co. Ltd. in Tokyo, Japan.

Murphy has said he would like to use his former company as a model. Within the first 14 years, they employed 35, Eppley said."
California Plans 28 Hydrogen Fueling Stations - Natural Gas Intelligence,"Wed, 23 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyYWxnYXNpbnRlbC5jb20vY2FsaWZvcm5pYS1wbGFucy0yOC1oeWRyb2dlbi1mdWVsaW5nLXN0YXRpb25zL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Natural gas and other competing alternative transportation fuels were left in the dust on Tuesday after the California Energy Commission (CEC) approved nearly $50 million in zero-emission construction projects, $46.6 million of which is supporting the building of a network of 28 hydrogen fueling stations throughout the state.

The awards were made by the five-member CEC under the state’s Alternative and Renewable Fuel and Vehicle Technology Program that has awarded $400 million to bolster the state alternative fuel infrastructure, including natural gas vehicles (NGV) and propane. The latest awards would fund hydrogen fueling and electric vehicle charging stations.

A somewhat obscure bill (AB 8) passed by the state legislature last year extended clean vehicle fees that all registered motor vehicle owners in the state pay for “pollution abatement” that goes to funding alternative fuel transportation stations, including NGVs. The bill also mandated that the CEC distribute at least $20 million annually for the building of hydrogen stations specifically. All of this funding is in place for the next 10 years.

The goal now is to build up to 100 hydrogen fueling stations by 2024 in a move to rekindle a California “Hydrogen Highway” program promoted by former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger that failed to get off the ground. Since then, current Gov. Jerry Brown has taken another approach getting the California Air Resources Board (CARB), as part of its broad powers to implement the state’s far-reaching 2006 climate change law (AB 32), to try to force oil companies to fund the stations, but eventually it has been shifted to the well-funded CEC alternative/renewable fuel program.

“These projects will accelerate a statewide hydrogen refueling station network that will support the commercial launch of hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles in 2015,” said a CEC spokesperson, who noted that the state has a zero-emission vehicle goal of getting 1.5 million hydrogen, battery electric, and plug-in EVs on the state roadways by 2025.

Eight organizations are among the recipients for the development of 28 hydrogen fueling stations and one mobile refueler, and they include an existing Southern California suburban compressed natural gas (CNG) station that will be adding the hydrogen option and the Gas Technology Institute (GTI), which is suppose to fabricate a first-of-its-kind mobile hydrogen fueler.

“The infrastructure network is designed to support consumer choices by locating refueling stations and electric chargers in strategic locations throughout California,” the CEC spokesperson said.

The $46.6 in grants and the number of stations were awarded to FirstElement Fuel Inc., $27.5 million, 19 stations; HyGen Industries LLC, $5.3 million, five; Linde LLC, $4.2 million, two; and one station each by ITM Power Inc., $2.125 million; Air Liquide Industrial US LP, $2.125 million; HTEC Hydrogen Technology & Energy Corp., $2.125 million; and Ontario CNG Station, $2.125 million. GTI received $999,677 to design, fabricate, test and deploy a commercial mobile hydrogen refueler with the capability to fill either 350-bar or 700-bar vehicle tanks through onboard metered dispensing hoses."

Gaston Savoi's Namibia and Uganda links – The Mail & Guardian - Mail and Guardian,"Thu, 10 Jul 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vbWcuY28uemEvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDE0LTA3LTEwLXNhdm9pcy1uYW1pYmlhLWFuZC11Z2FuZGEtbGlua3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Uruguayan businessman Gaston Savoi.

Uruguayan businessperson Gaston Savoi, ­who is facing corruption charges in South Africa, owns a company that supplies government hospitals in Namibia. The company is run by a politically connected entrepreneur who is close to the Namibian prime minister.

And Savoi’s Ugandan operation is headed by Eureka Karuhanga, also a member of a well-known, politically connected family.

Savoi allegedly worked with ANC heavyweight John Block in the Northern Cape, where the two men are facing corruption charges, and with former provincial ministers Peggy Nkonyeni and Mike Mabuyakhulu in KwaZulu-Natal.

Corruption, money-laundering and racketeering charges against Nkonyeni and Mabuyakhulu were controversially dropped in August 2012, but remain in force against Savoi and others.

Savoi says he is innocent of all the charges, which his South African lawyer, Michael Gradidge, described this week as “sensationalist”.

Savoi’s South African operation, Intaka Tech, has a 74% stake in Intaka Technology Namibia. In 2011 the latter won a R55-million contract to supply 32 Namibian government hospitals with life-saving oxygen and other medical gases.

His representative in Namibia is the flamboyant businessperson and philanthropist Knowledge Katti, a friend of Hage Geingob, the current prime ­minister and the probable next president of Namibia.



Knowledge Katti (The Namibian)

Katti is also the business partner of the Namibian home affairs minister, Pendukeni Iivula-Ithana, in an oil and gas company, Kunene Energy.

His corporate functions are attended by Namibia’s top politicians, including Geingob and former president Sam Nujoma.

Katti meets Savoi

A media conference last year – to announce the discovery of oil that had no commercial value – was held at State House in Windhoek and fronted by Katti accompanied by the majority of Cabinet ministers, including Geingob.

Asked whether it was Savoi’s modus operandi to make use of politically plugged-in individuals, Gradidge said: “We don’t hand-pick politically connected people. We choose our business partners with regard to a number of important ­factors, including financial factors, ability, skills, drive and business fit.”

Gradidge said that Savoi had met Katti “through common friends and business associates. He was impressed by his drive, ambition and business acumen and identified him as a business partner in Namibia”.

Katti could not be reached on the phone this week. AmaBhungane emailed questions to him on Tuesday, but had not received a reply by the time of printing.

Intaka Technology Namibia won a five-year contract renewal in 2011 after supplying medical gases to the Namibian health department since 2007.

The renewal was challenged in court by rival bidders Air Liquide South Africa and Oshimoko Medical Air and Oxygen Supplies, which argued that Intaka had been allowed to present its case to the health ministry whereas they had been denied such an opportunity, despite official promises.

The court application was rejected with costs.

Like Savoi’s support for the ANC in South Africa, Katti is a keen benefactor of Namibia’s ruling party, Swapo. Two years ago he donated R500 000 to Swapo at a gala dinner to raise funds for the party’s 2012 congress. Last month, he pledged the same amount to a presidential charity.

Katti’s riches

He is one of the elite Namibians who have profited handsomely from government oil prospecting licences.

In 2010, Namibia’s Insight magazine, an investigative journal, alleged that he had paid R2-million into the accounts of senior officials at Namibian oil parastatal Namcor and the energy ministry in exchange for oil exploration licences. He rejected the allegations.

In South Africa, he owns Three Diamonds Trading 123 and is the director of Giyani Gold, a company he and his business partner Duane Parnham bought into after selling their Toronto-listed company, UNX Energy, to a Brazilian state-owned firm for 730-million Canadian dollars (about R7.3-billion).

A 2010 presentation by UNX Energy showed that it had exploration licences covering 51 000km2 off the Namibian coastline.

The deal was done despite government complaints about Namibians who sell on their oil exploration licences for millions.

Responding to criticism of his ­association with well-connected individuals, including Katti, Geingob has been quoted by the Namibian media as saying that they do not control him.

Savoi’s Ugandan operation, Intaka Tech Uganda, is headed by Eureka Karuhanga, the millionaire daughter of Elly Karuhanga, a former Ugandan MP and confidant of President Yoweri Museveni.

Elly Karuhanga formerly represented the Nyabushozi constituency, which includes Museveni’s rural home town of Rwakitura. Museveni attended Eureka’s wedding in 2008.

Elly Karuhanga served as chairperson of Tullow Oil until December last year. The Irish oil firm has been at the centre of Uganda’s oil exploration since 2004.

The controversy-plagued Intaka business

Meanwhile, Intaka Technology Namibia has been mentioned in two major investigations into Namibia’s public health system.

A World Health Organisation (WHO) investigation in 2010 found that suppliers – which included Intaka – “failed to consistently deliver these medical gas products [to state hospitals] at the specified and agreed upon quality and standard, and the ministry of health and social services has also failed to demand that quality”.

A presidential commission of inquiry last year into Namibia’s public health system reported that health workers at the Swakopmund Hospital “expressed concern about the oxygen supply, which they said was not reliable”, and said that Intaka lacked the technical staff or an office in the region to safeguard the supply.

This had led to the cancellation and transfer of theatre cases.

Responding this week, Gradidge said very few of the shortcomings identified by the WHO related to Intaka.

He said the United Nations organisation had also found that there had been no adverse health outcomes resulting from the clinical use of the oxygen-enriched air in state hospitals.

Articles in the Namibian press about the oxygen supply in hospitals were “sensationalist and defamatory”, Gradidge said, as the journalists had failed to take account of the poor condition of the gas piping infrastructure and rolling power blackouts that were plaguing the country at the time.

AmaBhungane learned this week that Savoi’s Ugandan operation is headed by Eureka Karuhanga, a member of a well-known family close to Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni.

Revelations of Savoi’s ties with prominent individuals like Katti and Karuhanga come about four years after the Uruguayan businessman was charged for giving kickbacks and using strategically placed officials in South Africa to win tenders, charges he rejects.

He and several South African businesspeople, including three former provincial ministers, are entangled in corruption trials spanning two provinces, allegedly involving more than R144 million.

The State’s case against Savoi and others paints a picture of an organised crime ring where tenders were used as a mechanism with which to pry funds from the State for the personal benefit of the accused.

Money allegedly changed hands through a number of front companies, and Savoi admitted giving the ANC a donation of R1 million, although he said there was nothing wrong in doing so.

Savoi allegedly worked with ANC heavyweight and provincial minister John Block in South Africa’s Northern Cape province, where the two men are facing corruption charges, and with former provincial ministers Peggy Nkonyeni and Mike Mabuyakhulu in KwaZulu-Natal.

Corruption, money-laundering and racketeering charges against Nkonyeni and Mabuyakhulu were controversially dropped, but remain in force against Savoi and others. Savoy has denied all the charges through his South African lawyer.

We choose our business partners with regard to a number of important factors, including financial factors, ability, skills, drive and business fit.”

“We do not become business partners with those people in every instance. There are a number of variables involved, some of which are beyond our control,” he said.

Gradidge said Savoi had met Katti “through common friends and business associates. He was impressed by his drive, ambition and business acumen and identified him as a business partner in Namibia”.

Accompagné d’Olivier Leteurtre, qui pilote également le plan côté Dassault Systèmes, il a présenté les grandes lignes du projet à l’occasion des journées Advanced Manufacturing Meetings, qui se sont tenues à Clermont-Ferrand les 24 et 25 juin dernier.

Pour chacun des grands thèmes du plan (place de l’homme dans l’usine, matériaux de demain, outils numériques et nouveaux procédés de fabrication), Fives et Dassault Systèmes ont identifié les technologies qui existent et celles qui restent à développer.

""Chaque technologie à développer donnera lieu à des projets de R&D, et celles qui existent déjà seront mises en œuvre dans des usines pilotes, destinées à devenir des vitrines du savoir-faire français en matière d’usine du futur"", expose Stanislas Le Chevalier, avant de dévoiler la feuille de route de ce 34e plan.

Sept vitrines en 2015 et 11 en 2016

Une première vague de financements sera lancée courant 2014, pour sept projets qui démarreront avant 2015. Ainsi, Safran travaillera sur la technologie MIM (moulage par injection de métal) et Areva Wind développera son projet de fabrication d’éoliennes off-shore. Sur la question de la place de l’homme dans les usines, Air Liquide inaugurera une nouvelle unité de conditionnement de bouteilles de gaz liquide et DCNS se verra subventionné pour un projet dans ses chantiers navals de Bretagne.

Côté matériaux composites, Daher déploiera une ligne flexible et automatisée pour pièces aéronautiques de petites dimensions, et PSA mettra en œuvre une nouvelle ligne de production dans le cadre de son projet de carrosseries Excelcar. Enfin, le groupe agroalimentaire Triballat Noyal mettra en place un programme 5E (Efficacité énergétique et empreinte environnementale des entreprises).

La seconde vague portera sur 11 autres projets. Si le calendrier n’est pas encore définitif, on sait d’ores et déjà que ces projets recevront leurs financements en 2015 pour des lancements en 2016. Parmi ceux-ci, une ligne de production centrée sur l’homme dans l’usine Renault de Flins, et d’autres pilotes chez Lafarge, Solvay, Michelin, Seb, Valeo, Technip, Emin Leydier ou encore Enersens. Et une troisième vague est également prévue, pour des projets qui seront identifiés en 2015, financés en 2016 et lancés en 2017.

Un volet PME et ETI

En parallèle de ces vitrines technologiques, des projets de R&D seront lancés dans six domaines : l’impression 3D, le contrôle non-destructif, la robotique industrielle, la virtualisation, les matériaux composites et la place de l’homme dans les usines. Ces derniers seront pilotés par le CEA et des industriels comme Stäubli, le groupe Gorgé, ainsi que Fives et Dassault Systèmes.

Rappelons enfin qu’au-delà de ces projets, le plan 34 comporte un volet important sur l’accompagnement des PME et ETI. ""Le gouvernement a débloqué 1 milliard d’euros pour des programmes de diagnostic et de formation à l’excellence industrielle portant sur 2000 PME"", rappelle Olivier Deteurtre de Dassault Systèmes. Une somme qui servira également au financement d’équipements favorisant la compétitivité et l’efficacité énergétique des entreprises.

Philippe Teisceira-Lessard LA PRESSE

Deux autres personnes ont été blessées légèrement. Le secteur a été fermé à la circulation pendant quelques heures, ce qui a provoqué des bouchons de plusieurs kilomètres.

Au moment d'écrire ces lignes, les causes de l'accident demeuraient nébuleuses.

À l'arrivée des secours, le véhicule était renversé sur son flanc. Selon les autorités, le camion était rempli d'essence.

Lorsque le liquide s'est enflammé, une immense volute de fumée noire s'en est échappée, ont raconté des témoins. La bretelle de l'autoroute a été complètement noircie par l'incendie et des panneaux de signalisation ont été calcinés.

«Au départ, on avait vraiment l'impression qu'un quartier au complet brûlait», a relaté à La Presse Isabelle Daignault-Boulianne, une jeune femme qui roulait sur l'autoroute 40 lorsque l'accident s'est produit. «Ensuite, on a bien vu que c'était une explosion. La fumée était vraiment épaisse», a-t-elle ajouté.

Steve Camiré, lui, a vu «une boule de feu». «Après ça, on a vu la grosse boucane noire», a-t-il relaté.

Une autre voiture impliquée

En début de soirée, la Sûreté du Québec a confirmé qu'un seul autre véhicule avait été impliqué dans l'accident.

Il s'agissait d'«une fourgonnette avec deux personnes à bord, qui ont été blessées de façon mineure», a indiqué Christine Coulombe, porte-parole de la Sûreté du Québec (SQ). Les images montrent d'ailleurs un véhicule de ce type complètement ravagé par les flammes.

Des témoignages selon lesquels quatre autres véhicules - dont un poids lourd - avaient été impliqués dans l'accident se sont révélés infondés, selon la porte-parole de la SQ.

Quant aux circonstances exactes qui ont mené à la catastrophe, elles restent à éclaircir. C'est ce que tenteront de faire les enquêteurs et les experts en reconstitution d'accidents qui ont été dépêchés sur place.

Sur le site web de Transports Québec, les caméras qui transmettent habituellement des images de la circulation dans ce secteur ne relayaient plus rien dimanche soir.

Bouchons et déversement

L'autoroute 40 a été fermée au complet, dans les deux directions. Lundi matin, peu avant 6 h, Transports Québec a annoncé la réouverture de toutes les artères, sauf de la bretelle de l'autoroute 640 Est qui mère à l'autoroute 40 Est.

Au plus fort de la congestion, Transports Québec rapportait que les bouchons de circulation attribuables à l'accident s'étendaient sur 12 km.

L'accident a été signalé à Urgence-Environnement, qui l'a classé «2» à son échelle de gravité, qui va de 1 à 3.

«En gros, ça veut dire qu'il y a un impact sur l'environnement», a résumé André Ménard, porte-parole du service d'intervention rapide du ministère de l'Environnement. «Le panache n'a pas duré très longtemps. Après, c'était de la vapeur d'eau émise par l'extinction de l'incendie.»

M. Ménard a confirmé à La Presse que le camion-citerne accidenté transportait de l'essence. «Pour que ça s'enflamme et que ça explose si facilement, ça ne pouvait être que de l'essence, a-t-il dit. Selon les informations obtenues par les services incendie, l'essence aurait brûlé entièrement. L'impact environnemental est beaucoup plus dans l'air que dans le sol.»"

Une qualité esthétique très prisée par les esthètes de la mode, qui ne jurent actuellement que par les notions de fluidité, de tombé, de pudeur cool et de séduction discrète.Alliant ces différents points forts, le trench souple imaginé par le bureau de style de Zara se révèle aussi facile à vivre que faussement classique. Sans parler de son noir réglisse infiniment conciliant, qui lui permet de s'adapter à toutes les situations.On pourra ainsi le porter de jour avec :Un slim olive 7/8 + cette paire de Birkenstock Arizona noires + ce caraco noir glissé sur le devant du slimCe short mom + cette paire de baskets carbone + cette chemise à pois nouée sur le devantCette robe bleu ciel + ces sandales à talons carrésCette jupe mi-longue bleu marine + ce top cropped noir + ces sandales noires hautes perchéesCe slim bleu à peine délavé roulotté sur la cheville + ce pull fin noir + ces mocassins léopard + une fine ceinture vernie noireLe soir, on n'hésitera pas à le porter à même la peau, ceinturé haut, associé à une paire de sandales noires vertigineuses et à un chignon de danseuse."
