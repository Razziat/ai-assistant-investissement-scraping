The Northern Lights project is aimed to mature the development of offshore carbon storage on the Norwegian Continental Shelf and has the potential to be the first storage project site in the world receiving CO2 from industrial sources in several European countries.

Under the frame of this Memorandum of Understanding the parties will explore the possibility of cooperating in Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) development, which includes CO2 capture, liquefaction, and transportation to an offshore natural reservoir.

This initiative illustrates Air Liquide’s commitment to mitigate climate change. As part of its global approach, Air Liquide not only takes actions to reduce the carbon intensity of its activities, but also works with its customers towards a sustainable industry and contributes to the development of a low carbon society. Air Liquide offers and develops an array of technical solutions for industry and transport, such as oxy-combustion, electrolysis-based carbon free hydrogen, or biomethane.

In the frame of Energy Transition, CCS is one of the pathways to contribute to decarbonising industries, and can be implemented with readily available technologies for an affordable abatement of large quantities of CO2 emissions.

Cummins closes $290 million acquisition of fuel cell maker Hydrogenics [Update] - FreightWaves,"Mon, 09 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWlnaHR3YXZlcy5jb20vbmV3cy9jdW1taW5zLWNsb3Nlcy0yOTAtbWlsbGlvbi1hY3F1aXNpdGlvbi1vZi1mdWVsLWNlbGwtbWFrZXItaHlkcm9nZW5pY3PSAWtodHRwczovL3d3dy5mcmVpZ2h0d2F2ZXMuY29tL25ld3MvY3VtbWlucy1jbG9zZXMtMjkwLW1pbGxpb24tYWNxdWlzaXRpb24tb2YtZnVlbC1jZWxsLW1ha2VyLWh5ZHJvZ2VuaWNzL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Cummins Inc. (NYSE: CMI) closed its $290 million acquisition of Canadian fuel cell and hydrogen production technologies provider Hydrogenics Corp.(NASDAQ: HYGS) on Monday, Sept. 9.

It is the second major investment in fuel cell technology for commercial vehicles in a week.

On Sept. 4, United Kingdom-based CNH Industrial announced it was investing $250 million in startup fuel cell truck maker Nikola Corp., which plans to commercially produce Class 8 heavy-duty trucks by the end of 2022. Nikola also disclosed Sept. 5 that Robert Bosch LLC and solar panel maker Hanwha Group had invested a combined $230 million.

“There’s a growing realization that there is a lot of value in fuel cells for heavy-duty trucks in certain types of applications,” Navigant Research principal analyst Sam Abuelsamid told FreightWaves. “The infrastructure challenge is a lot less of an issue with commercial vehicles because a lot of the applications are return to base or fixed routes.”

"Extreme dub delay, in the new Ninja Tune-Erica Zen Delay - CDM Create Digital Music - Create Digital Music","Wed, 18 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vY2RtLmxpbmsvMjAxOS8wOS9uaW5qYS10dW5lLWVyaWNhLXplbi1kZWxheS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"We can talk a lot about engineering. But at some point, you pack vacuum tubes and DSP and chips together, and you get a delay that’s extreme enough to have Ninja Tune and Coldcut printed on it.

Yes, meet the Zen Delay, a new unique stereo delay from Erica Synths, but carrying the Ninja Tune label on it. So, yeah, the record industry is now so bad, we’re making analog delays. Wait – that’s kind of awesome. Stereo delays are more fun to some of us than records, anyway.

Now, I’ve known about this thing for quite a while, so if it seems like I’m raving, I’m not getting that from the press release. Dr. Walker, the underground acid master from Germany, first clued me in to this project with Matt Black, Ninja and Coldcut co-founder. Ninja’s logo is on it, but it’s really both the baby of Ingmar and Matt – part Air Liquide, part Coldcut – with all the sound elements from Riga’s Erica.

The idea is pretty simple: make a stereo delay that you can dial from gentle stereo warmth and space all the way up to extreme dub and screaming overdrive.

Erica sent me a late-stage prototype to test, and I spent a lot of time with it. The trick here is really the combination of analog and digital ingredients:

Stereo delay. You get a precise, full-ranging stereo dub delay, with as little as 1ms all the way up to 5 seconds, and it’s syncable.

And thanks to being digital, you can choose what that delay is – tape, tape pingpong, “digital” (sounding more or less like your basic digital delay), or a special fifth mode. (On mine, that fifth mode was something called “crossover,” which wasn’t terribly useful. Now, it’s a vintage delay with some nice lo-fi touches, I’m told, but I haven’t yet gotten to test it, as it’s actively in development.

Multi-mode filter. There’s a 24dB filter with resonance, which you can use in lowpass, highpass, or bandpass modes.

Valves! Valve saturation and overdrive are what really complete the package – you’ll spot that lovely tube popping out of the top.

Tempo controls. There’s CV in, plus MIDI in, plus tap tempo, so you can use external time, free time in milliseonds, or tap in a tempo.

There’s also clock division, in “beat” mode (which wasn’t available yet on the firmware I first tested). Push and hold the TAP button, and the delay time knob becomes clock divider/multiplier – down to an eighth of the beat, and up to 8 times the beat. (This will actually increase the potential length of the delay up to 50 seconds, so I guess fast bathroom breaks are now possible onstage!)

High-quality digital engine. High-spec ADC and DAC combine with a 24-bit, 48k digital engine.

Stereo (1/4″) jack ins, stereo jack outs, MIDI in, CV in (on full-sized jack, not minijack), plus 12V power.

So in other words, you get the precision and precise timing of the digital delay, plus the ability to choose different delay models in a single unit. But the overall impact is very, very dirty, when you want it to be – thanks to that analog overdrive. So when you want warmth or grime or total insanity, you can dial that in.

“Complete package” and “dialing” are also essential, because Erica have really leaned in to the heavy, vintage, metal feeling of the box. It’s 870 grams of metal here (almost two pounds), with one-knob-per control, and each knob is a big, smooth-feeling dial.

This is a box for your hands, not your feet – something that you do want to reach out and grab and adjust. That makes it ideal for studio and live production. I can absolutely see wanting this live.

Erica have been in this territory before, with their screaming Acidbox (based on the Polivoks filter, and sounding just as angry and Soviet), and the Fusionbox. The Acidbox is terrific, but it’s like having a giant bottle of hot sauce at the ready – it’s just this mental USSR-style filter. The Fusionbox is the nearer comparison, and it might still be the one you want, since it has flanger and ensemble stereo in addition to delay.

But make no mistake – as a dubby delay, the Zen Delay is just about perfect. Easy access to the Drive setting, the useful dubby delay modes, and that magical distortion make it something truly special. And it’s only something Erica could do – it combines their custom DSP, their lovely Latvian-made chips, and this analog into one box.

To anyone who says no one is “innovating,” maybe it’s just a misunderstanding of what musical innovation is. Erica’s creation here is a kind of new vintage. The starting point is some traditions, but constructed into something that you haven’t had before – which is basically what instrument design has always been about.

Pricing: pre-order at €499 + VAT, with the first 300 units with a limited edition Zen Delay t-shirt at a discounted €454 + VAT, from the Ninja Tune and Erica Synth websites.

Ships in December.

https://www.ericasynths.lv/shop/standalone-instruments-1/zen-delay/

Now, you may or may not have half a grand to spend on a delay that you won’t get until Christmas. But, if you do, this is clearly a nice way to go about it.

I’m editing some sounds and will post at the end of the day. But this short video with The Bug sums it up beautifully:

The press release claims this is the first effects unit to be produced by an electronic label, though I’m not entirely certain that’s correct. (Some CDM reader probably has a tiny label that ran off a few pedals, I’m guessing, before I jump out on a limb and go along with the claim!)"

The global market for industrial gases is estimated to cross $115 billion in terms of revenue by the end of 2025.



The global market for industrial gases has been growing at a good pace in recent years, with the market expected to pick up growth in the coming years to 2022.



Let us take a look at the primary driving factors behind the industry:

The demand for industrial gases has been the boom in metal manufacturing.

This led to an increase in the demand for industrial gases such as hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and argon.

As manufacturers move rapidly to adopt new technologies for steel production, this is also driving the demand for oxygen, which has seen a sharp increase in the last two to three years.

An increase in investment in the aerospace and automobile sectors are also driving demand for industrial gases as these sectors require metal fabrication services.

Need for oxygen has been rapidly growing in the field of gas cutting as it ensures a clean cut through and through.

Argon is also seeing an increase in demand in the manufacturing and fabrication sectors for use in the welding processes as a shielding gas.

The demand for industrial gases also continued to remain strongly driven by an increase in investments in infrastructure development and petroleum reserves in emerging markets. In fact, metal fabrication and production sector are expected to remain the second major sector for industrial gases, next to petroleum refining.



Traditionally, the sector is known to be surging ahead regardless of economic factors, owing to the evolving multiplicity of new applications both in conventional and novel domains, with Asia-Pacific accounting for almost 35% of the global industrial gases market value.



The industry gained momentum after 2012, following the anticipated turnaround in the economic situation, increased production and inventory levels and greater demand as consumer confidence stabilizes. Over the longer term to 2022, the annual growth rate in the industrial gas market is expected to significantly exceed the rate of industrial production driven by multitude of factors including opening of new startups, rapid industrialization of emerging economies, increasing demand for energy, environment regulations, improving healthcare sector, and advancements in industrial technology.



In recent years there has been a significant development in the high technology markets including semiconductor, flat panel display, solar panels and photovoltaic cells which continues to drive the demand for high purity industrial gases. Further demand is expected to emanate from the development of other alternate energy sources such as hydrogen fuel cell technology which is being pursued to replace fossil fuels for automobiles and electricity generation.

China's Sinopec Said to Support Trans-Caspian Plan - Radio Free Asia,"Mon, 09 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJmYS5vcmcvZW5nbGlzaC9jb21tZW50YXJpZXMvZW5lcmd5X3dhdGNoL2NoaW5hcy1zaW5vcGVjLXNhaWQtdG8tc3VwcG9ydC10cmFucy1jYXNwaWFuLXBsYW4tMDkwOTIwMTkxMTMyMTQuaHRtbNIBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZmEub3JnL2VuZ2xpc2gvY29tbWVudGFyaWVzL2VuZXJneV93YXRjaC9jaGluYXMtc2lub3BlYy1zYWlkLXRvLXN1cHBvcnQtdHJhbnMtY2FzcGlhbi1wbGFuLTA5MDkyMDE5MTEzMjE0Lmh0bWwvYW1wUkZB?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A plan to build a gas pipeline across the Caspian Sea would hardly be unusual. Western countries have been promoting a Trans-Caspian route for energy supplies from Central Asia for the past 25 years.

But the latest push for a Trans-Caspian Gas Pipeline (TCGP) may be unprecedented because one of the members of a consortium behind the new proposal is reported to be a subsidiary of a Chinese national oil company.

Until now, China's only interest in Central Asian gas was in east-bound deliveries through pipelines to the Chinese market. But now, one of China's major state-owned enterprises is said to be backing plans to pump gas west from Turkmenistan across the Caspian through Azerbaijan and on to Europe.

Reports of China's support for a TCGP project surfaced last month at an economic forum in Turkmenistan's Awaza tourist center, marking the first anniversary of the convention on the legal status of the Caspian. The agreement was reached after decades of negotiation by the shoreline states of Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkmenistan.

According to an Aug. 13 report by Turkmenistan's Orient News Agency, representatives of a European-Chinese consortium expressed ""readiness to implement the Trans-Caspian Gas Pipeline project"" at a meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Myratgeldi Meredov and energy adviser Yagshigeldy Kakaev.

Members of the consortium were identified as Edison Technologies GmbH of Germany, MMEC Mannesmann GmbH, Air Liquide Global E&C Solutions of France, and Sinopec Engineering Group (SEG), the construction arm of China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (Sinopec).

Speaking for the consortium, Edison Technologies CEO Edison Kasapoglu cited the group's capabilities to build a 300-kilometer (186-mile) pipeline on the Caspian seabed, along with required gas wells, purification plants and compressor stations.

""The European market is interested in it, and we consider it a great step to return to the promising Caspian region,"" Edison said.

Despite the attractions, reports by Azerbaijan's Turan Information Agency and other news sources saw little chance that a TCGP project would overcome objections from Russia and Iran.

Although Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan have theoretical rights to build a pipeline across their contiguous subsea sectors, Moscow and Tehran have the power to stop them under the convention's terms.

The key Article 14 allows parties to ""lay trunk submarine pipelines on the bed of the Caspian Sea, on the condition that their projects comply with environmental standards and requirements embodied in the international agreements to which they are parties,"" including a framework convention that gives Russia and Iran effective vetoes.

For western nations that have been calling for a TCGP project since the 1990s, the provision blocks a breakthrough that the Caspian convention was supposed to achieve.

In comments on last month's Caspian forum, Russian and Iranian officials were quick to douse any sign of progress on a TCGP plan, raising environmental concerns to protect their own competitive gas routes.

""The interests of preserving the unique ecosystem of the Caspian have an absolute priority over any hypothetical economic projects,"" said Sergei Prikhodko, the Russian government's first deputy chief of staff, according to Turan.

""Iran is against any trans-Caspian pipelines,"" said Behrouz Namdari of Iran's National Gas Company, as quoted by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

But the intransigence on the trans-Caspian issue makes it all the more remarkable that a Chinese national oil company would lend its name to a project that Moscow firmly opposes.

On its face, the entire notion that a little-known consortium could accomplish a goal that has eluded Western governments seems far-fetched.

""Our competences are in the project management and the technical guidance for industrial and institutional customers,"" Edison Technologies says on its website.

The company lists SEG as a partner on the site but shows no information on the Caspian proposal. SEG made no mention of the Caspian announcement on its website at www.segroup.cn.

Air Liquide has denied the report of its involvement in a consortium planning for a TCGP project, naturalgasworld.com said on Aug. 21.

Edward Chow, a senior associate for energy and national security at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said that a TCGP project would also face economic obstacles.

""Getting across the Caspian is only half the problem. How does one economically justify the new infrastructure needed to get gas the rest of the way to Europe, since existing infrastructure is either full and/or controlled by others?"" Chow said.

The doubts are compounded by the current glut of gas on global markets, he said.

How then to explain China's reported involvement in a TCGP proposal that would challenge Russia's Caspian interests?

The potential clash could raise doubts about whether relations between China and Russia are as close as both countries claim.

In 2014, President Vladimir Putin famously said that Russia had ""no disagreements"" with China.

In the past year, Russia and China have said that their strategic partnership and mutual trust have risen to new heights.

""Our relations with China have a depth and breadth like with no other country of the world today,"" Putin said during President Xi Jinping's visit to St. Petersburg in June, Interfax reported. ""We really are strategic partners in the full sense of this word.""

On the eve of the visit, Xi referred to Putin as ""my best and bosom friend,"" said The Washington Post.

But Sinopec's reported support for a trans-Caspian project may raise questions, particularly with regard to energy interests in former Soviet states.

The implied competition has been especially active in Turkmenistan for well over a decade.

In the 1990s, Russia used its control over the Soviet-era Central Asia-Center (CAC) pipeline network to monopolize Turkmenistan's gas exports and limit access to cash-paying customers in the West.

In 2006, China stepped in with an agreement to build the Central Asia Gas Pipeline (CAGP) system from Turkmenistan through Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan to the Chinese border, giving Ashgabat an eastern alternative.

Thanks to state-owned China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC) and billions of dollars of loans for gas field development, Turkmenistan has become China's biggest single source of imported gas with estimated supplies of 34 billion cubic meters (1.2 trillion cubic feet) last year.

Competition for Turkmenistan's resources became evident this year, when Russia's Gazprom struck an agreement to restart imports from Turkmenistan for the first time since a complete cutoff at the start of 2016.

The resumption in April came months before the expected startup of Russian gas flows to China through Gazprom's massive Power of Siberia pipeline, expected in December.

Gazprom's imports of Turkmen gas are seen as reducing the volumes that would otherwise be available to China. A shortfall would make China more reliant on Russian gas from the new Power of Siberia line.

In July, Gazprom signed a five-year contract to buy up to 5.5 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas annually from Turkmenistan, Interfax reported, although Russia has little need for more gas.

Gazprom recently lowered its export target for the year as the result of weaker European demand.

Although the volumes of Russian purchases are relatively small, they may already be having an effect.

Turkmenistan's supplies of gas to China fell 8.6 percent year-on-year in July. In the first seven months, deliveries to China dropped 2.6 percent, Platts Commodity News said.

Two explanations

Chow suggested two possible explanations for a Sinopec role in the TCGP proposal.

One is that a local Central Asian branch of SEG is only seeking an opportunity to do some work on a feasibility study for the project.

The other is that Beijing may be testing the waters to find out whether Turkmen gas has any future in Europe or not.

""If it does, then China wants a piece of the action as a way to obtain a larger upstream stake in Turkmenistan,"" Chow said.

""If it does not, then China can toughen its negotiating position on Turkmen gas to China,"" he said.

Sinopec's reported support for a TCGP project could also be sending a competitive message to Russia at a sensitive time when Gazprom is rushing to complete two pipeline projects for gas supplies to Europe. Western nations are concerned that the projects could isolate Ukraine by bypassing the major trunk lines through the country.

In the north, Gazprom's Nord Stream 2 twin-pipeline project to carry 55 bcm per year across the Baltic Sea to Germany is 75-percent complete but still faces misgivings from the European Union over the Ukraine issue and the threat of U.S. sanctions.

In the south, two pipelines of Russia's TurkStream project would each carry 15.75 bcm across the Black Sea to Turkey with extensions to Bulgaria and other European markets.

But profitability and EU policy remain uncertain with potential competition with gas from Azerbaijan along the Western-backed Southern Gas Corridor. Russia expects to complete both of its projects by the end of the year.

The announcement of Sinopec's support for a TCGP project may suggest a nearly-symmetrical strategy, countering Russia's attempt to undercut Turkmenistan's gas supplies to China.

Beijing may be telling Moscow, ""Two can play at this game."""
Paris-based startup Trustpair raises €4 million to fight IBAN fraud - EU-Startups,"Tue, 17 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1LXN0YXJ0dXBzLmNvbS8yMDE5LzA5L3BhcmlzLWJhc2VkLXN0YXJ0dXAtdHJ1c3RwYWlyLXJhaXNlcy1lNC1taWxsaW9uLXRvLWZpZ2h0LWliYW4tZnJhdWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris-based Trustpair is on a mission to prevent business transfer fraud. The startup has now raised a €4 million funding round led by Breega and existing investor Axeleo Capital, which it will use to pursue its ambition of becoming the go-to solution for finance departments fighting IBAN fraud.

Founded in 2017 by Baptiste Collot, Alexandre Gillier & Simon Elcham, Trustpair uses AI technology to conduct automated IBAN checks, extensive audits of a company’s vendor database, as well as verification of vendors’ payment files.

After only a year of sales efforts, finance departments in more than 30 large French groups have adopted Trustpair’s solution, including names such as Air Liquide, Bolloré, Decathlon, and Bpifrance. In order to speed up finance departments’ digital transformation, Trustpair’s team is expected to double in size over the next 12 months with plans to recruit in R&D, sales, marketing, and account management functions.

“In 2018, one company in four was a subject of attempted fraud, with some losses exceeding €500k,” said Baptiste Collot, CEO and co-founder of Trustpair. “At a time when fraud risk continues to increase, Trustpair responds to finance departments’ challenges in terms of real-time security, productivity and quality vendor data management. Our goal today is to accompany finance departments’ in their digital transformation with the simplest and most reliable technology possible.”

“Trustpair’s revolutionary platform continuously checks and validates suppliers’ data, tackling a real pain point for companies by reducing wire transfer fraud risk,” said Maximilien Bacot, founding partner at chez Breega. “This Series A funding round will enable Trustpair to broaden its product offering and target international markets given its already remarkable growth. Breega is convinced that Trustpair’s platform will become the benchmark solution for all finance departments.”

“Axeleo Capital has been fortunate to work with Trustpair since its seed investment in 2017,” said Mathieu Viallard, general director of Axeleo Capital. “In just one year, Trustpair has shown its full ability to become a high quality solution for finance departments as they fight against IBAN fraud. ‘Vendor’ data management and the risk associated with that is becoming a crucial subject for CFOs who need to put an end to archaic manual processes and protect themselves against an ever increasing number of cyber-frauds.”"
"Designed with welders, for welders : the revolutionary Qlixbi solution - Air Liquide","Thu, 19 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvaW5kdXN0cnkvZGVzaWduZWQtd2VsZGVycy13ZWxkZXJzLXJldm9sdXRpb25hcnktcWxpeGJpLXNvbHV0aW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Drawing on its international expertise in welding and cutting gases, Air Liquide has pioneered an innovative offer that eases the difficult work of welders: Qlixbi, a breakthrough packaged gas offer including a new generation gas cylinder and a suite of digital solutions designed with welders, for welders. We spoke to Craig Hall, managing director at IM Fabrications Ltd., about the benefits that Qlixbi have brought to his workshop.

Experts welding custom catering solutions When Craig Hall took over as managing director at IM Fabrications Ltd., a small-scale commercial kitchen workshop in Lytham St. Annes on Lancashire’s Fylde coast in the UK, he knew it would mean a lot of work. Located on an industrial estate next to Blackpool Airport, IM Fabrications has a staff of less than 10 and a part-time secretary, meaning that Craig’s day starts at 7am, when he checks emails and takes care of day-to-day accounting matters; he also writes estimates for prospective clients, plans jobs and shifts, and ensures health and safety compliance before, at about 8am, his favourite part of the day begins: welding. “Whatever paperwork doesn’t get done in the morning, I do later in the afternoon, after I’ve finished on the shop floor,” says Craig. IM Fabrications specialises in catering work, manufacturing stainless steel components for restaurants and bars, school kitchens, and even laboratories. “When you watch a TV cookery show and see all the metal counters, tables, sinks, and vents,” explains Craig, “that’s exactly the kind of thing we are expert at making.” Although IM Fabrications produces standard sizes of the kind found in most purpose-built kitchen spaces, an increasingly important area of the company’s work is producing custom solutions.

Trustworthy equipment for peace of mind

It is this ability to offer bespoke items that marks Craig’s company out and sees him asked to price jobs as far away as Peterborough, Sheffield, or the Scottish Borders: “Although there are six of us welders here, often there are only two of us on the shop floor because the others are out fitting,” says Craig, gesturing about him. “That means that we need to trust each other: sometimes, one person will finish on a Friday and be on site the next week, while the other comes back on Monday after a few days out fitting. The workshop and the equipment need to be ready to use.”







“The Qlixbi gas cylinder package is very helpful in this regard,” explains Craig, since the convenient changeover mechanism “quick, easy, and everyone knows how to use it.""







""Back when I was at college,” he reminisces, chuckling, “regulators were difficult to attach and sometimes, if they hadn’t been put on properly, you’d come back in to an empty bottle the next morning. So essentially, with Qlixbi, it’s about peace of mind when I leave the shop floor.”

“It’s not just the speed and ease of changeover, though,” he adds. Craig also likes the reserve indicator on the side that turns red when gas is starting to run low, which allows him to efficiently identify empty cylinders “at a glance, whereas before, you’d have to go around tapping them to see if there was anything left.” He is also thankful for Qlixbi’s ergonomic wheel and connector that rotates 360 degrees, making it both easier and safer for his employees to move cylinders. “It’s all very well thought through,” he concludes.

I accept - Launch the video A digital tool to optimize gas stocks Thanks to the Qlixbi manage digital platform’s auto restock and stock alert features, “Qlixbi can even automatically reorder cylinders for me when I need them!” he adds, visibly impressed. At IM Fabrication’s current size, he explains, gas stocks are not yet an issue, “but this may well be something we use in the future as we grow.” The Qlixbi fab assist app also strikes him as “something we might need as our clients increasingly move their designs into the digital space”. In the two decades since Craig left school and began his apprenticeship as a welder, he has seen the market change, but not the technology: “Qlixbi really changes the physical side of how we work though, and I expect the digital transformation will start to make itself felt in the coming years. It’s something we should get into,” he adds, “but at the moment, it’s a question of time,” looking at his watch in way which indicates that he really will need to get started with today’s job soon. When asked what it is specifically that he loves about welding, Craig thinks hard for a moment: “I can’t really explain it, but there’s a pleasure in knowing how to do something well – and when you’re behind the mask, you’re in your own world,” he says, pulling down his safety visor.

Qlixbi in action

Qlixbi's ergonomic wheel allows easier cylinder handling across the workshop.

Qlixbi has an instant click-in connector. This way switching cylinders is super quick.

Craig can focus on his work and monitor the remaining level of gas in the blink of an eye.

Thanks to a mix of mechanical and digital innovations, Qlixbi makes the act of welding easier, faster and safer. Voir les diapositives précédentes Voir les diapositives précédentes

Behind the scenes of Qlixbi: a design thinking approach. We talked to Jean Bécourt Foch, Qlixbi Program Director at Air Liquide, about what Qlixbi offers, how it was designed, and where it is headed.

Why did Air Liquide want to provide welders with a completely new gas cylinder solution?



Welders are talented craftsmen who love their work, but they are in a highly competitive marketplace, often in small companies in which they have to take on a lot of supplementary functions, and their job is both physically and mentally demanding: it’s loud, they have to move large, heavy components, and they also have to understand and adjust a wide range of parameters such as material thickness, amperage, and gas supply. We wanted to offer them support in their busy, complex working lives and thus contribute to their competitiveness. How was Qlixbi developed to suit welders’ needs?



We started with design thinking workshops and in-depth interviews with over 700 welders, some of whom we shadowed on their shop floors in order to better understand their needs. We also engaged with suppliers of cylinders and valves as well as the service companies who supply them to welders. Then we started the first cycle of development, which was creating a ‘minimum viable product’ – i.e. a working pilot which could be tested with welders early on before it became a prototype – before moving into the second cycle, which was making it mass producible. This new way of working not only kept us close to welders’ needs, but also cut our development time to four years whereas, on other projects, we needed seven. Over 700 welders, actual Air Liquide customers, were involved in the Qlixbi Innovation process/ Design thinking What can we expect from Qlixbi in the near future?



The physical components of Qlixbi are now on the marketplace and will stay as they are: cylinders and accessories that are used every day need to have a long and stable life. We will continue to develop the digital component of Qlixbi, however, as it is an agile element which responds to changes in the market and to our clients’ needs."

MATHESON’s Westlake, Louisiana Complex stands to exemplify MATHESON’s position in the Petrochemical Community.

MATHESON built its first Air Separation Unit (ASU) in the Westlake Complex in the 1990s. In February 2019, MATHESON commissioned its fourth ASU in the Complex and dramatically changed the gas supply landscape in the gulf coast area.

Atmospheric Gases

Anchored by world class ethane cracker and derivatives plants, the Westlake Complex includes a 35-mile pipeline network supplying oxygen and nitrogen to customers in the gulf coast area.

The Complex is also positioned to provide bulk supply of oxygen, nitrogen, and argon (by truck and rail) as well as to support the supply of packaged gases and liquefied gases in cylinders and Dewars.

The scale of the Westlake Complex – not just in terms of gas supply, but also in terms of engineering and construction – is validation of MATHESON’s position as a world class source for the supply of tonnage atmospheric gases, as well as the technology to produce these gas products. MATHESON designed and constructed the Westlake Complex and operates the ASUs and pipeline.

Beyond Westlake, MATHESON is expanding its onsite and pipeline ASU footprint in other parts of the US. In 2016 MATHESON acquired ASU operations (18 ASUs in the US) divested by Air Liquide. In addition, MATHESON has built 13 new ASUs and an ASU Remote Operations Centre in Irving, Texas.

Hydrogen, CO, and Syngas

Furthering its interests in the Petrochemical Community, MATHESON recently acquired a significant portion of Linde’s HyCO (hydrogen, CO, and syngas) business and operations in the US.

MATHESON’s HyCO business includes a fleet of operational assets in several US states, and supply management for pipeline customers in the Houston Texas Ship Channel area. A scalable HyCO Remote Operations Centre in La Porte, Texas supports operations and plant monitoring with global reach. Plant operations in Europe, Singapore, and Japan are also part of the global portfolio.

The HyCO acquisition brought with it additional resources and expertise including process operations, business development, technology, engineering and project management, and has greatly expanded MATHESON’s capabilities to serve future petrochemical, oil refining industry, and syngas needs, worldwide.

Looking to the Future

MATHESON continues to distinguish itself on the world stage as a world-class, world-scale supplier of tonnage gases and technology to the customers in the petrochemical and refining markets.

Among domestic US providers of oxygen, nitrogen, argon, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas, MATHESON stands as North America’s fastest growing industrial gas company with world-leading capability."

The Brussels taxis sector unveiled two brand new taxi models on Thursday: an electric car designed to accommodate people with reduced mobility and a hydrogen taxi.

The former was developed with an access ramp for wheelchairs by Mostefa Beggar, managing director of MBT Adaptation, the official transformer of Tripod Mobility.

“You can easily put a wheelchair in by lowering the front seats and the customer will feel safe with the straps and a guardrail that he can stand on,” Baggar told La Dernière Heure.

The second car is a hydrogen-run Toyota Mirai from the French taxi company, Hype. In Paris, Hype runs a regular taxi service in partnership with hydrogen provider, Air Liquide.

“When we fill the vehicle, we fill up with hydrogen as we would refuel and then the vehicle has a range equivalent to a normal vehicle of the order of 600 kilometres,” Mathieu Gardies, founder of Hype, told La Dernière Heure. “We are in discussion with the regional authorities so that this model can be put into service in the Brussels Region and the feedback we have received so far is positive.”

Beggar hopes that these models can be generalised in the Brussels Region. “We hope that similar vehicles will see the light of day, but for that to happen, public authorities need to install charging stations,” he added.

There are currently only two hydrogen filling stations open in Belgium, as previously reported. Air Liquide in Zaventem and Colruyt in Halle.

Air Mauritius’ Airbus A330-900neo - TTG Asia,"Tue, 03 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR0Z2FzaWEuY29tLzIwMTkvMDkvMDMvYWlyLW1hdXJpdGl1cy1haXJidXMtYTMzMC05MDBuZW8v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Xinyi Liang-Pholsena takes a seat on board Air Mauritius’ brand-new aircraft and discovers an exciting addition to the Airbus family.

Why

Air Mauritius took delivery of its two Airbus A330-900neo order on April 18, becoming the first operator of the new aircraft type in the Southern Hemisphere and the world’s first airline to operate a combination of both the A330neo and A350XWB.

The A330neo is powered by Rolls-Royce’s latest Trent 7000 engines and features a new wing with increased span, and new A350XWB-inspired sharklets. Air Mauritius’ A330neo is currently deployed on routes connecting Port Louis to London Heathrow, Paris, Mumbai and Singapore, among others.

Air Mauritius’ Airbus A330-900neo 1 of 2

What

Air Mauritius flies to Singapore thrice weekly on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, with a fourth weekly flight to be added during peak season between November 10, 2019 and January 12, 2020.

After stopping in Singapore, the service continues to Kuala Lumpur before turning back to Singapore for the onward journey to Mauritius. The overall journey between Singapore and Port Louis span a distance of 3,261km and nearly seven hours.

How

I was excited to experience the A330neo, as Air Mauritius is one of the earliest adopters of this new aircraft type at time of flying – with other operators being TAP Air Portugal and Air Senegal with no passenger services in South-east Asia.

As I prepared to board the new plane, named Aapravasi Ghat after the UNESCO World Heritage Site near Port Louis in Mauritius, I noted the ‘sunglasses’ effect around the cockpit windows, not unlike its A350 cousin.

The A330neo plane has 260 seats in economy class with a 2-4-2 configuration and 28 seats in business class in a 1-2-1 configuration. My economy-class seat offers pretty generous legroom at 18 inches with a six-inch recline, and despite occupying a central seat I did not feel cramped during the entire journey. On my return trip to Singapore, I had an aisle seat and was even able to catch a couple of hours’ of sleep during the seven-hour flight.

The take-off and landing on the new aircraft was visibly smooth, and I could track the progress as the plane flew over the Indian Ocean on the full HD screen. The inflight entertainment also featured an interesting selection of songs and movies, with Wi-Fi on board.

The inflight meal was my first introduction to Mauritian cuisine, with options such as black lentils and fish curry. The overall flight was quiet and the LED mood lighting changed as the flight progressed, and the flight crew was friendly and professional.

Verdict

The A330neo definitely offers similar levels of comfort as the A350XWB. Safe, comfortable and professional, I definitely look forward to flying with Air Mauritius again."

The groundbreaking ceremony for the hydrogen production plant was held on August 29, Pilipinas Shell said in a disclosure on Thursday.

The facility will be the first of its kind in the country and is targeted to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of the refinery, the company said.

“We’ve embarked on a partnership that will capitalize on the strength and expertise of both parties—Pilipinas Shell in the oil industry and Air Liquide’s 117 years of experience in the industrial gas space,” Pilipinas Shell Business Opportunity and Business Development manager Paolo Barredo said.

“This partnership will develop the capability to produce hydrogen which enables the refinery to process more crude oil varieties into more quality fuels. We expect to complete the project by end-2020 and reap the benefits from this venture starting 2021,” Barredo said.

The hydrogen unit will be built in Batangas, enabling the refinery to extract more diesel fuel compared with its current product slate.

A dedicated facility will capture and liquify carbon dioxide for other uses, according to Boon Hai Ng, Air Liquide Southeast Asia Region vice president.

“This undertaking is proof of our commitment to invest in projects that will enhance the competitiveness of our refinery to support the country’s energy needs while reducing our carbon footprint,” Cesar Romero, Pilipinas Shell country chairman, said. —Ted Cordero/VDS, GMA News"
PH's first hydrogen optimization plant to rise in Batangas - pna.gov.ph,"Sun, 01 Sep 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiJ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBuYS5nb3YucGgvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMTA3OTIyMdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"BATANGAS CITY -- The country's first of its kind Hydrogen Optimization HyStar Manufacturing Project will soon rise in this city’s Tabangao Shell Refinery following its groundbreaking on Thursday (Aug. 29) by the Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation (PSPC) in partnership with investor Air Liquide.

The petroleum firm officials described this project as “another milestone in industrial development” and “an innovative venture into an environment-friendly industry intended to boost the fuel production in the country.”

Shell Refinery Business Opportunity and Business Development Manager Paolo Barredo said HyStar is a partnership project of Shell and Air Liquide designed to put up hydrogen manufacturing unit facility that will supply hydrogen to the refinery to allow it to process more advantaged feedstocks.

“This is the first of its kind in the Philippines and is targeted to be operational next year. This means more options for crude to allow us to produce more quality fuels for consumers,” Barredo described.

He also said Shell buys crude which is a raw material for processing products like diesel and gasoline that are sold in retail stations.

Upon completion of the project, Barredo said there will be a production of extra hydrogen which is a component required by the plant -- an advantage for the production process.

“This project allows us to have more options when problem in the supply of crude happens in case trouble erupts in the Middle East,” he said.

He assured that as the normal process, the hydrogen manufacturing unit emits carbon dioxide (CO²) in the atmosphere, but with this facility project partnership, the CO² as a pollutant into atmosphere would instead be captured by Air Liquide to be tapped for a more beneficial manner like its utilization in the production of carbonated drinks.

Shell Tabangao Refinery General Manager Jan-Peter Groot Wassink said the company and government officials graced the groundbreaking rites of “this new chapter in the history of Tabangao Shell Refinery where Shell has been a responsible partner in the community and contributes to nation-building”.

“Normally, Shell invests in their own facility but this time we recognize the expertise of Air Liquide as they have the expertise in industrial gas while we have the expertise in petroleum products, so with the partnership of the two companies, this will create leverage and will bring more benefits to the country,” Wassink remarked.

Air Liquide Southeast Asia Region Vice President Boon Hai Ng also graced the groundbreaking event.

For his part, Shell Companies in the Philippines Country Chairman Cesar Romero stressed the project is proof of the continued commitment of Shell to the country and Batangas City and its ability to partner with a formidable industry like Air Liquide that boasts of 117 years of experience in the industrial gas industry.

City Mayor Beverly Rose Dimacuha welcomed the new development that is taking place in the city and assured the city government’s continuing and strong partnership with the petroleum firm and investors.

“Let us continue to have a strong partnership, together we continue to carve a bright future for Batangas City and the entire country,” the city chief executive said.

Meanwhile, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), represented by the Board of Investments (BOI) Governor Angelica Mapua-Cayas, hailed the partnership of the two multinational companies.

“This is a testament to the country’s conduciveness to investments with its minimal environmental impact and state-of-the-art technology,” Cayas said.

Also, Batangas 5th District Rep. Marvey Mariño expressed pride that Batangas City is first to host this kind of project as this translates to more jobs for Batangueños.

“Indeed, the city is the best place for this project because investors are given importance here. Shell can count on our support for this undertaking and their succeeding projects,” Mariño assured. (Maroe T. Genosa/PNA)"
