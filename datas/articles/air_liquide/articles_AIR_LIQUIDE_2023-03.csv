"Air Liquide to modernize and lower the carbon footprint of two oxygen production units in Tianjin, China - Air Liquide","Tue, 21 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5haXJsaXF1aWRlLmNvbS9ncm91cC9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy1uZXdzLzIwMjMtMDMtMjEvYWlyLWxpcXVpZGUtbW9kZXJuaXplLWFuZC1sb3dlci1jYXJib24tZm9vdHByaW50LXR3by1veHlnZW4tcHJvZHVjdGlvbi11bml0cy10aWFuamluLWNoaW5h0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide will invest around 60 million euros to revamp two Air Separation Units (ASUs) the Group operates in the Tianjin industrial basin, in China. This announcement comes within the context of the renewal of a long-term industrial gases supply contract with Tianjin Bohua Yongli Chemical Industry Co., Ltd (“YLC”), a subsidiary of the Bohua Group. As part of this modernization plan, Air Liquide will significantly reduce the CO2 emissions linked to the production of oxygen and other gases with the adaptation of these ASUs so they can run on electrical power instead of steam. In addition, the Group has signed a three-party Memorandum of Understanding with YLC and the Tianjin Binhai District, notably to explore the implementation of Carbon Capture, Use and Storage (CCUS) solutions.

Replacing the current steam supply of the ASUs by electricity will avoid the emission of 370,000 tonnes of CO2 per year. This is comparable to the equivalent electricity-related emissions of more than one million Chinese households. The two electrified Air Separation Units will produce oxygen and other air gases to supply YLC as well as other industrial customers in the Tianjin basin. They will have a total oxygen production capacity of ~4,000 tons/day. Planned to be operational mid 2024, the two ASUs will be modernized by Air Liquide Engineering & Construction without any disruption of supply to YLC and other local customers.

This project also includes the possible supply of low carbon energy to the units through Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) currently under discussion. This would allow further emission reductions in the future.

This contract extends Air Liquide’s involvement in the development of the Tianjin basin, which has spanned more than 20 years, and hosts many major international and local chemical companies. Air Liquide owns and operates a total of 4 production sites and a large pipeline system connecting 3 industrial parks (Lingang, Dagang, Nangang) in the region, supplying industrial gases to Large Industries, Industrial Merchant and Healthcare customers.

François Abrial, Member of the Air Liquide Group’s Executive Committee supervising Asia Pacific, said:

This contract renewal and new investment further enhance Air Liquide’s long-term collaboration with Tianjin Bohua Yongli Chemical Industry. Leveraging our expertise in air gases production, the project demonstrates our capacity to bring reliable and competitive solutions for our customers while reducing carbon emissions. In line with its sustainable development commitment as part of its strategic plan ADVANCE, Air Liquide is proud to support Tianjin’s ambitious climate plan.

Ammonia is widely expected to be the preferred molecule for importing large amounts of green hydrogen into Europe, as it easier to store and transport than compressed or liquefied H 2 and also contains more energy by volume.

“A global supply chain infrastructure is already in place for [ammonia’s] production, transportation and utilization at large scale to serve various industries,” the company says in a press release.

“This allows regions with abundant renewable energy to export ammonia to end users across the globe, where it can be converted back to hydrogen to contribute to the decarbonization of industry and mobility.

The notion of converting imported ammonia back to hydrogen is controversial. Multiple studies have shown that the increased cost and efficiency losses from the energy-intensive process to “crack” NH 3 into its constituent parts — which requires a catalyst and high-temperature heat — would inevitably result in very expensive hydrogen. In fact, 15% of the energy contained in ammonia would be required for the cracking process.

This has led to arguments that it would better to use imported ammonia as ammonia, ideally replacing grey NH 3 made from unabated natural gas.

“It is economically more efficient to ship hydrogen as ammonia. There is however a cost penalty at the destination in converting ammonia back to hydrogen,” said an international shipping study published by the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the UK’s University of Manchester.

“Therefore, the best export markets for green hydrogen producers are likely to be those with direct uses of ammonia, such as in fertiliser manufacture — avoiding the need for reconversion.”

The Antwerp pilot project — which is planned to be operational in 2024, and has been promised financial backing from the Flemish government — will use a new “highly efficient” process invented by Air Liquide — “next-generation reactor tubes heat-integration technology”.

“This technology allows for the highest possible ammonia to hydrogen conversion yield and zero direct CO 2 emissions,” the company says.

“With this cracking technology, Air Liquide will further contribute to the development of hydrogen as a key enabler of the energy transition.”

Several other companies have already announced plans to build ammonia crackers at European ports, alongside new NH 3 import terminals.

Air Products announced a plan in November to build a large-scale green ammonia import terminal at the German port of Hamburg by 2026, and crack the NH 3 back into hydrogen and nitrogen.

And both German utility Uniper and UK oil giant BP separately plan to build green ammonia import terminals at the port of Wilhelmshaven, 125km west of Hamburg."

Volodymyr Dorogobid, 38, and Tigran Avetisyan, 39, were both charged with three counts of unlawful use of an unmanned aircraft and a felony charge of evidence tampering.

Investigators say they received a call about a drone flying over Dow Chemical in Hahnville February 21. When they went to investigate, they found a black Kia Sportage on the shoulder of LA 3142.

Inside the vehicle, detectives found Dorogobid in the rear driver’s side seat with a controller and Avetisyan in the front passenger seat wearing virtual reality goggles, the arrest record says.

The men were told to land the drone, and the records show they did comply by landing it on the top of the levee. Both men went to “get the drone with a bag,” the investigators said.

“They were on the (top of levee) for approximately five minutes and returned with the bag,” the arrest records said.

The detectives said that the men then refused to show them the drone and refused to answer any more questions. They later learned that the men allegedly tried to hide the drone in a field.

St. Charles Parish Sheriff Greg Champagne said, “We are working with the FBI on this case. We confiscated their drones, cell phones and goggles.”

Investigators say they observed the drone from the St. Charles Parish Emergency Operation Center. The drone reportedly flew over Dow Chemical, Linde and America Air Liquide.

Building the future of renewable hydrogen in Normand’Hy - Air Liquide,"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvaHlkcm9nZW4vYnVpbGRpbmctZnV0dXJlLXJlbmV3YWJsZS1oeWRyb2dlbi1ub3JtYW5kaHnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“This is where Air Liquide’s electrolyzer will be built,” indicates Rahim Salemkour, Project Director. “It is scheduled to be commissioned in 2025 and will be the largest in the world.” We are in Port-Jérôme, a small town in a region of Normandy, France, that is known for its industrial prowess.

In front of us, construction is underway at the site that will soon be home to the Group’s new renewable hydrogen production unit. “Air Liquide Normand’Hy is a large-scale electrolyzer with an initial capacity of 200 megawatts,” Rahim explains. This is equivalent to the average annual electricity consumption of more than 235,000 French households. “We will be able to produce up to 28,000 tons of hydrogen per year here through water electrolysis, which is a production process that uses electricity to ‘break’ purified water molecules in order to separate the hydrogen from the oxygen.” Air Liquide Normand’Hy is the corner-stone of a project aimed at decarbonizing this industrial basin, which Air Liquide is implementing alongside other major industrial players in the region. The strong level of interest in the project means it has also garnered the backing of the French government as part of an Important Project of Common European Interest.1

“ Normand’Hy’s major asset is its ability to produce competitive and carbon-free hydrogen on a large scale from renewable energy. ” Rahim Salemkour Project Director, Air Liquide

“To enable this kind of large-scale production of renewable hydrogen,” states Rahim, “the Group has entered a joint venture with Siemens Energy to develop large-capacity electrolyzers. This will allow us to pool our technology and expertise in proton-exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis.” This Franco-German partnership is crucial for the development of a European hydrogen sector, which Air Liquide is spearheading. Air Liquide has chosen to install this new electrolyzer in Port-Jérôme because it is a strategic location for the Group. “We have had a presence here since the 1970s and have rolled out many technologies in the region,” explains Mathieu Cavélius, Development Engineer. Over time, the Group has cemented its presence by developing a pipeline network and forging long-standing partnerships with major refiners in the region who use hydrogen to remove sulfur from fuel. “It was clear that we would continue to roll out new technologies here,” explains Mathieu. Indeed, Port-Jérôme is already home to the largest steam methane reforming hydrogen production unit2 operated by Air Liquide in France, just a few kilometers from the Normand’Hy site. Here, in 2015, the Group installed its Cryocap™ technology, which uses cryogenics to capture up to 98% of the CO₂ emitted during hydrogen production – a world first. Thanks to Cryocap™, Air Liquide has created new opportunities for capturing and reducing the carbon emissions of its own sites, as well as those of its customers. “Today, we are seeing great progress being made with the construction of this vast electrolyzer,” Rahim says. The main challenge lies in sourcing the electricity that powers it. “The electricity used will come from wind turbines and photovoltaic solar farms located near the site. This is what we mean when we talk about renewable hydrogen. There will be no CO₂ emissions produced during the production process,” said Rahim. As a result, up to 250,000 tons of CO₂ emissions per year will be prevented, the equivalent of the emissions of a French city with 25,000 inhabitants.3

“ This pioneering project is a unique opportunity for industrial players in this area of Normandy, as well as for mobility – it will be a milestone. ” Mathieu Cavélius Business Developer, Air Liquide

Downstream, Air Liquide Normand’Hy will be connected to the regional industrial ecosystem. This will allow the hydrogen to be distributed directly to industries in the area. “We will continue to collaborate with refining, petrochemical and chemical companies that require hydrogen for their production. Today, with the climate challenges we are facing, it is a matter of gradually replacing the hydrogen we already supply with renewable hydrogen. This way, the carbon footprint of industrial players can be reduced,” said Mathieu. This hydrogen will also be used to decarbonize heavy transport, starting with heavy goods and industrial vehicles, followed by buses and commercial vehicles in the region. Not only will the Air Liquide Normand’Hy site produce renewable hydrogen, the project as a whole has an environmental approach. Liliane Herculano, a Project Manager who deals with regulatory aspects, explained: “Due to its size, the project has been subjected to an environmental assessment. With the help of an environmental engineer, we carried out a year-long fauna and flora impact study, which represents a complete life cycle.” This allowed Air Liquide to adapt the project in terms of its design, construction and operation. “As a simple example, we decided to excavate the site between September and October 2022, as this is a time of year when animals are neither hibernating nor in their breeding period,” explained Liliane.

“ With the help of an environmental engineer, we carried out a year-long fauna and flora impact study, which represents a complete life cycle. ” Liliane Herculano Project Manager, Air Liquide

Air Liquide has worked to preserve the environment and support the entire area surrounding the Normand’Hy site. This project will contribute to the economic development of the region and build up a unique expertise in hydrogen production. The Group is already committed to developing this expertise through the H2 Academy, a higher education training initiative that teaches younger generations in the area about new career paths within the hydrogen industry. Air Liquide’s objective is to accelerate the development of renewable and low-carbon hydrogen on a global scale. To achieve this, it has decided to invest at least 8 billion euros in this area by 2035. The Normand’Hy project is this ambition brought to life!

Developing a new generation of electrolyzers with Siemens Energy Air Liquide and Siemens Energy have embarked on a joint venture in the large-scale production of renewable hydrogen electrolyzers. The combined expertise of the two leading companies in their field will enable a sustainable hydrogen ecosystem to emerge in Europe."
Equinor and Air Liquide permanently scrap landmark liquified hydrogen shipping project after failing to attract ... - Hydrogen Insight,"Fri, 10 Mar 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oeWRyb2dlbmluc2lnaHQuY29tL3RyYW5zcG9ydC9lcXVpbm9yLWFuZC1haXItbGlxdWlkZS1wZXJtYW5lbnRseS1zY3JhcC1sYW5kbWFyay1saXF1aWZpZWQtaHlkcm9nZW4tc2hpcHBpbmctcHJvamVjdC1hZnRlci1mYWlsaW5nLXRvLWF0dHJhY3QtY3VzdG9tZXJzLWluLXR3by15ZWFycy8yLTEtMTQxNTk3N9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Update: The decision to halt the project was made in 2022. The project has now been permanently terminated ""for all practical purposes"", an Equinor spokesperson confirmed to Hydrogen Insight. Article was updated on 10 March 2023.

When the Aurora liquid hydrogen project in Norway was unveiled in early 2021, it was declared to be “an important step on the journey towards decarbonising the maritime shipping sector” and was immediately shortlisted for state aid as an Important Project of Common European Interest.

“Aurora is the first initiative in Europe that aims to build a complete value chain producing and using green liquid hydrogen [LH 2 ] for maritime shipping applications,” said Air Liquide vice-president Lars Strandberg at the time.

But in 2022 the three project partners — Norwegian oil giant Equinor, French industrial gases firm Air Liquide and Norwegian power company Eviny (formerly known as BKK) — agreed to “stop the Aurora project in its original form”.

Now, the project has been permanently scrapped.

""The Aurora project is for all practical purposes terminated"", an Equinor spokesperson confirms to Hydrogen Insight.

This is because it failed to attract sufficient purchases of green liquid hydrogen, which was due to its high price, according to an Eviny press release.

“In order to be able to make an investment decision, the parties are dependent on a minimum volume for the production facility,” it said.

“With today's framework conditions, the additional cost of choosing hydrogen compared to marine diesel is too high for many shipping companies.

“The parties in the Aurora project believe there is a need for further support schemes for hydrogen production in the form of contracts for difference to make hydrogen available at a price the end user can pay.”

Air Liquide stated in April 2021 that the project in Mongstad, near Bergen, would be distributed across western Norway on local shipping company Wilhelmsen’s planned “Topeka” LH 2 -powered roll-on, roll-off vessels.

The six tonnes of liquefied hydrogen due to be produced each day via electrolysis were “estimated to cover the LH 2 needs across western Norway in 2024-2026, while paving the way to scaling up production for additional demand”, the French company stated at the time.

“Liquid hydrogen is expected to be a key contributor on the shipping industry’s path towards decarbonization,” it added. “Projects for hydrogen operation are currently underway within cruise ships, cargo ships, offshore vessels and ferries.”

And Steinar Eikaas, cive-president for low-carbon solutions at Equinor stated at the time: “Aurora is an important step on the journey towards decarbonising the maritime shipping sector and Equinor is playing an important role both in the production of renewable liquid hydrogen as well as in stimulating the market for zero-emission shipping fuels by shifting cargoes from road-based transport to the Topeka base-to-base vessels.”

But the expected demand for LH 2 in the maritime sector has so far largely failed to materialise, with shipping companies now stating a preference for using green ammonia or methanol — both of which are easier to handle than liquid hydrogen (which must be stored at minus 253°C) and contain more energy per cubic metre.

Nevertheless, the three Aurora partners remain bullish on LH 2 ’s future as a shipping fuel.

“The industry players still aim to make liquid hydrogen available for commercial shipping,” the Eviny press release states.

Indeed, several ferries could soon be powered by H 2 along Norway’s extensive coastline — albeit compressed hydrogen, rather than liquefied.

The Norwegian government has required that two hydrogen-powered ferries service the country’s longest ferry connection, a four-hour journey in choppy waters between Lofoten and Bodø. Last week, Swedish company PowerCell announced they would deliver hydrogen solutions to the two ferries, an agreement valued at €19.2m, in a project they named “the world’s largest hydrogen project to date in the marine industry”."
TotalEnergies pens green power deals with Sasol and Air Liquide | Business - News24,"Tue, 07 Mar 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MyNC5jb20vZmluMjQvY29tcGFuaWVzL3RvdGFsZW5lcmdpZXMtcGVucy1ncmVlbi1wb3dlci1kZWFscy13aXRoLXNhc29sLWFuZC1haXItbGlxdWlkZS0yMDIzMDMwN9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For more financial news, go to the News24 Business front page.

Multinational energy giant, TotalEnergies, has signed corporate power purchase agreements (PPAs) for two projects to provide Sasol and Air Liquide with 260MW of renewable energy over the next 20 years.

TotalEnergies announced it would develop a 120 MW solar plant and a 140 MW wind farm in the Western Cape to supply around 850 GWh of green electricity per year to the Sasol's Secunda site in Mpumalanga where Air Liquide operates the biggest oxygen production site in the world.

The PPAs with Sasol and Air Liquide have been signed with a consortium comprised of TotalEnergies Marketing South Africa (70%), renewable energy developer Mulilo (17%) and a to-be-announced B-BBEE partner (13%).

The two projects are subject to regulatory approvals and are expected to be operational in 2025.

Newsletter Daily SA Money Daily The biggest business, economic and market news of the day.

The PPAs signal progress in Sasol's plans to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from its South African operations by at least 30% by 2030, off a 2017 baseline.

Sasol is the largest emitter of GHG in South Africa after Eskom, and its Secunda plant is currently the largest single-site emitter of GHG globally.

Sasol and Air Liquide have committed to a joint initiative to procure a whopping 1 200MW of renewable energy capacity by 2030. In January, the two announced their joint signing of two long-term PPAs with Enel Green Power for a 220MW wind project to supply Secunda.

Sasol has also signed a PPA with Msenge Emoyeni Wind Farm for a 69MW project to supply Sasolburg, which is expected to be online within the first quarter of 2024. This power supply will be key for the synthetic fuels and chemicals group to achieve first production of green hydrogen as part of its ambition to lead the development of a green hydrogen economy in Southern Africa.

TotalEnergies said the agreements demonstrate its positioning to contribute to the evolution of the energy mix in South Africa and noted the projects would directly impact the local community through job creation.

""Power generation in South Africa is still 80% based on coal, and power cuts occur daily. With these developments, we are proud to support Air Liquide and Sasol for their supply of green electricity,"" said Vincent Stoquart, Senior Vice president, Renewables at TotalEnergies.

Decarbonization and reduction of energy consumption: Air Liquide to implement an innovative solution for Verallia - Air Liquide,"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3d3dy5haXJsaXF1aWRlLmNvbS9ncm91cC9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy1uZXdzLzIwMjMtMDMtMTYvZGVjYXJib25pemF0aW9uLWFuZC1yZWR1Y3Rpb24tZW5lcmd5LWNvbnN1bXB0aW9uLWFpci1saXF1aWRlLWltcGxlbWVudC1pbm5vdmF0aXZlLXNvbHV0aW9uLXZlcmFsbGlh0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide will implement for Verallia, the European leader and the world’s third largest producer of glass packaging for beverages and food products, a customized solution allowing to reduce CO2 emissions and energy consumption. The Group is thus mobilizing its innovation capabilities and its know-how to accompany the conversion of Verallia’s plant in Pescia, Italy, from a traditional combustion process to an optimized oxycombustion on the occasion of the construction of a new furnace on the site.

The solution provided by Air Liquide combines the supply of oxygen and the reuse of the heat available from the glass production process. In the framework of a long-term contract, the Group will build and operate for Verallia a new generation onsite oxygen production unit in Pescia, Italy. The oxygen produced by this unit will replace the air usually injected into the furnace, thereby allowing to melt the glass by oxycombustion and to improve the efficiency of the process. In addition, Air Liquide will supply its HeatOxTM proprietary technology to recover the heat emitted by the glass furnace in order to further reduce the amount of energy needed to produce glass.

The global solution provided by Air Liquide will very significantly contribute to the reduction by 18% of the CO2 emissions (scope 1 and 2) that Verallia targets for its glass furnace in Pescia.

In addition, the new generation onsite oxygen production unit to be built and operated by Air Liquide will be equipped with a unique cryogenic process and will be 10% more energy efficient than the previous generation. Producing oxygen onsite also avoids its transport in liquid form by trucks.
