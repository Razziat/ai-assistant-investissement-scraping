Toyota's hydrogen car gets a name and more US filling stations (update: and price) - Engadget,"Mon, 17 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZ2FkZ2V0LmNvbS8yMDE0LTExLTE3LXRveW90YS1taXJhaS1oeWRyb2dlbi1uZXR3b3JrLXVzLW5vcnRoZWFzdC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toyota has announced that its upcoming fuel cell vehicle (FCV) will be called the Mirai and that it's building a network of hydrogen stations in the US Northeast to support it. The $69,000 (update: maybe as cheap as $45,000 -- check after the break)vehicle is due to arrive in the US in 2016. The Japanese automaker proclaimed that ""the future has arrived,"" (Mirai means ""future"" in Japanese) which may make the thousands of people who've owned a Honda FCX Clarity FCV since 2005 gag. But despite being late to the game, Toyota is now making a huge bet on FCVs. It has teamed with Air Liquide to build 12 hydrogen stations in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. The stations will be ""strategically placed"" so that drivers of the 300-mile-range Mirai can tool around the region without (much) anxiety. Previously, Toyota said that 19 hydrogen stations would be installed in California.

Ironically, Toyota's announcement comes at the same time Honda said that its own hydrogen car would be postponed until 2016, though it added that it'd announce its own infrastructure plans soon. Hydrogen-powered cars are about half as energy efficient as battery-powered vehicles, because not only is energy lost in making hydrogen, but fuel-cells (like Toyota's) are only 60 percent or so efficient. In addition, both Honda and Toyota now have to play catch-up with Tesla and others on re-fueling infrastructure. Despite those issues, FCV's do have one big advantage for drivers -- it only takes 5 minutes to fill one up.

Update: In a subsequent press release, Toyota pinned the Mirai's MSRP at $57,500, and said that with federal incentives (assuming they're extended into next year), it could be purchased for below $45,000. A 36-month lease option will also be available, with $3,649 due at signing and $499 per month. That's not cheap either, but the ""360-degree Ownership Experience"" could make the packages worthwhile. That includes complementary hydrogen fuel for up to three years, an eight year 100,000 mile warranty on fuel cell components, a 24/7 concierge and roadside assistance package, Entune with a map app that points to hydrogen filling stations and finally, three years of Toyota Care that covers recommended factory maintenance."
Toyota hopes Mirai becomes the next Prius - Fortune,"Mon, 17 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAxNC8xMS8xNy90b3lvdGEtbWlyYWktaHlkcm9nZW4tZnVlbC1jZWxsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"One of the most advanced and sophisticated alternative-fuel vehicles soon will be available in the U.S. with the debut of Toyota’s Mirai, a vehicle powered by a hydrogen fuel cell.

Mirai’s fuel cell converts hydrogen to electricity and emits water vapor, emitting no pollutants. A major hurdle to the technology is the lack of an infrastructure to distribute hydrogen, which Toyota (TM) is addressing by promoting and facilitating the construction of fueling stations in California and five northeastern states.

Unlike a typical battery-powered electric vehicle, which has a range of less than one hundred miles, Mirai (“future,” in Japanese) claims a range of 300 miles on a tank of hydrogen, which can be refilled in five minutes.

Honda introduced a fuel-cell vehicle called FCX Clarity on a limited basis in the U.S. in 2002. Honda has leased only a handful of the model in the past two years.

Many auto executives, including Elon Musk, the chief executive officer of Tesla, regard hydrogen fuel cells as an impractical way to fuel cars. Others see hydrogen as a fuel of the future, one that will gain in popularity in the next decade or two for its portability, cleanliness and ease of use.

Toyota, a proponent of hydrogen, has turned skeptics into believers before, notably with the introduction in 1997 of its gas-electric hybrid Prius. Prius, now sold in several variants, has evolved into one of Toyota’s most popular and profitable vehicles.

“Toyota’s vision of a hydrogen society is not just about building a great car, but ensuring accessible, reliable and convenient refueling for our customers,” said Jim Lentz, chief executive officer of Toyota’s North American operations on Sunday at a briefing in Los Angeles.

In a video address, Akio Toyoda, the automaker’s chief executive officer, said “our fuel cell vehicle runs on hydrogen that can be made from virtually anything, even garbage. It has a fuel cell that creates enough electricity to power a house for about a week.”

Hydrogen, which typically isn’t found in nature in its pure form, can be manufactured by a number of processes, often as a byproduct of hydrocarbon refining.

In May, Toyota announced a $7.3 million loan to First Element Fuels to support the construction of 19 hydrogen filling stations in California. The automaker is collaborating with Air Liquide to build 12 filling stations in Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Rhode Island.

Toyota hasn’t set a retail price for Mirai, though it could be in the neighborhood of $60,000. The automaker initially will absorb large losses on the vehicle – as it did in the early days of Prius – until such time as it proves popular in the mass market.

Rival automakers know a great deal about fuel-cell technology as well, and no doubt will be eager to get their hands on a Mirai to see what’s under the hood. They’ll be even more eager to gauge how consumers, regulators and pundits respond to the car."

to support the introduction of the toyota ‘mirai’ in 2016, the company alongside air liquide, will develop and supply a network of 12 state-of-the-art hydrogen stations in new york, new jersey, massachusetts, connecticut and rhode island. the expansion of the fuel cell infrastructure investment to the northeastern states adds to the continued development of 19 stations in california and toyota’s aim of diminishing the dependence on environmentally-harming oil. even though being green and safe are key aims of the car, the company’s extensive test tracks show that it still offers a fun drive thanks to its low center of gravity and dynamic handling.

‘toyota’s vision of a hydrogen society is not just about building a great car, but ensuring accessible, reliable and convenient refueling for our customers,’ said jim lentz, toyota north america CEO, when outlining the reasons for expanding the infrastructure. ‘I am happy to announce that this vision will expand beyond the borders of california and give customers the opportunity to join the fuel cell movement.’

That's the reality of Toyota's upcoming fuel cell vehicle, which today has been confirmed as the Mirai.

Mirai, which means “future” in Japanese, is being hailed as a turning point for the automotive industry as it’s destined to be the first mass produced vehicle powered by a fuel cell stack, which takes in hydrogen and oxygen and generates electricity to drive its motor(s). The only by-product is water.

The Mirai, first shown in concept form at the 2013 Tokyo Motor Show, is expected to be sold to customers instead of being leased, as has been the case for previous fuel cell vehicles like Honda's FCX Clarity. In Japan, the vehicle will be priced close to seven million yen (approximately $60,294). Pricing in other markets will be announced closer to launch.

Of course, whether hydrogen is a realistic widespread fuel source (right now it's most certainly not) and whether it's sourced from non-fossil-fuel sources (right now most of it comes from natural gas), the idea of a fuel cell vehicle is intriguing to many. To help answer these unknowns, Toyota has also announced a new commitment to drive the development of a hydrogen refueling infrastructure, with a new initiative in five northeastern U.S. states set to join the existing initiatives on the west coast.

The automaker is collaborating with a company called Air Liquide to develop and supply a phased network of 12 hydrogen stations targeted for New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island, a move similar to Tesla Motors’ [NSDQ:TSLA] rollout of Supercharger stations to help spur the adoption of its battery-powered electric cars. The states and locations Toyota picked were selected in the greater New York and Boston areas so that a backbone of a hydrogen highway for the Northeast corridor could be developed. Specific details of the collaboration will be revealed in the coming months.

The new initiative builds on Toyota’s previous support for hydrogen infrastructure development in California.

At least, that’s what Toyota is hoping for.

Among all the obstacles ‘green energy’ vehicles must overcome, the fossil fuel-centric infrastructure that makes the world go round is clearly the biggest.

Recommended Videos

Toyota’s all-new Mirai, which uses hydrogen fuel cells for propulsion, is a forward-thinking catalyst to change the way we move about, a dramatically-envisioned leap toward a zero-emissions, carbon neutral planet.

The car’s name means ‘future’ in Japanese, and although it’s not perfect, this vehicle is one of the biggest steps toward changing that future we’ve seen in years.

Laying the groundwork

The first thing you should know is that the Mirai is much more than a car; it’s one of the highest-profile ambassadors for what Toyota calls a ‘hydrogen society.’

The bold four-door sedan does this by simply raising awareness, but Toyota is also directly involved in the proliferation of fueling stations.

At the Mirai’s first drive press event in Newport Beach, California, the automaker announced a partnership with industrial gas supplier Air Liquide to build 12 hydrogen stations across the Northeastern United States, specifically in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island.

In May, the brand committed financial support to FirstElement Fuel, who plans to build 19 stations in California, and the Golden State itself will fund 100 stations by 2024. To put that in perspective, the University of California Irvine’s Advanced Power and Energy Program has stated that 68 stations are needed to realistically serve 10,000 FCVs.

So why hydrogen? In simple terms, it’s a clean, sustainable, and efficient technology. In the Mirai, you pull up to the pump and refuel with a nozzle just like you’re used to in a conventional vehicle.

I have just driven the future. At least, that’s what Toyota is hoping for.

The compressed, gaseous hydrogen fills two carbon fiber-wrapped resin composite tanks under the rear seats in about five minutes, mingles with oxygen (sucked in by the car’s air intake), and through the miracle of chemistry, you have energy.

That energy powers the electric motor under the hood, and the waste product, H2O, dribbles out underneath the car. For those who are worried (or excited) about spraying the motorists around you, fret not: the Mirai produces only about half a bottle of water over its 300-mile range.

The system can be purged via the ‘H2O’ button located to the left of the steering wheel. I dare you not to press it.

On the road

Some expect the Mirai, given its 4078-pound curb weight, to drive like a bloated Prius. Personally, I found it felt like a distant relative of the game-changing hybrid, one that’s been working out, eating cleaner, gotten a high-paying job, and recently shopped for some new clothes.

The Toyota’s electric motor produces 153 horsepower, which propels the car to 60 mph in around 9.0 seconds. The powertrain’s instant torque makes it feel a fair bit quicker than that though, and the placement of the hydrogen equipment gives the car a low center of gravity and sporty feel.

On the road, the dramatically styled Mirai is quiet (outside of a slight whine from the electronics and regenerative brakes), and is quite comfortable. There are heated seats front and rear, a JBL sound system, and all the safety bells and whistles you’d expect from a modern Toyota. However, like the Chevy Volt, the Mirai only seats four.

There’s even an optional Power Take-Off device, a trunk-mounted plug that allows owners to funnel electricity into their homes like a mobile generator. According to Toyota, the Mirai can power the average home’s essentials for up to a week.

All this does come at a price, though. The Mirai starts off at $57,500, with federal incentives potentially dropping the price down to $45,000.

As far as filling up, Ali Hoffman, CEO of Air Liquide says that hydrogen will cost about $10 per kilo to start, which equates to about $4 or $5 a gallon. However, Mirai drivers will fill up for free for the foreseeable future, and we garnered about a 50-mpg equivalent during our short drive in California.

Up in the air

Out of all the people I talked to at the first drive event, nearly all of them found the Mirai a pleasure to drive. That said, there are still a lot of criticisms and uncertainties pertaining to hydrogen fuel cells cars, some of which I’d like to (briefly) address here.

The Mirai drives like a distant relative of the game-changing Prius hybrid.

Every time FCVs come up in conversation, somebody inevitably brings up the Hindenburg, and I struggle to suppress a sarcastic groan.

The tragic explosion happened 77 years ago, and the technology has improved tenfold since then. While the hydrogen in the Hindenburg was carried in cotton bags coated in flammable cellulose acetate and aluminum powder, the fuel in the Mirai is stored in nigh bulletproof tanks that are likely stronger than the structures surrounding them.

I’d also like to kindly remind you that gasoline, something most people have no issues driving around on, is also a dangerous, flammable liquid, and one that has the tendency to catch fire. Let’s not act like we’re going from the padded room to the front lines here.

There are valid criticisms of the technology out there, one of which being the ‘moving the tailpipe upstream’ question. Steve Chalk, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Renewable Energy at the Department of Energy, admitted that Toyota’s endeavor does just that, but explained that synthesizing hydrogen from a source like natural gas creates half the carbon emissions than gasoline overall.

Moreover, it’s a domestic source of power, and ‘green’ hydrogen can be siphoned from water through electrolysis and even bio-waste. California law says that 33 percent of the fuel from state-supported fueling stations must come from renewable sources like these.

Conclusion

The Mirai, and hydrogen vehicles in general, are on the proverbial razor’s edge. If they’re a huge success, the world as we know it will undoubtedly change. If they turn out to be a dud, it was a lot of money, research, and hubbub about nothing. Realistically, I find that to be unlikely.

The ‘future’ goes on sale in California in fall 2015.

Along with Toyoda's announcement of the Mirai model name, Toyota's North American CEO Jim Lentz announced a company commitment to assisting with the installation of fueling stations in five Northeastern states.

As it has done in Southern California, where it is helping to fund the creation of the earliest hydrogen stations, Toyota will collaborate with a national operator to develop a network of refueling sites.

The partner for the Northeast will be Air Liquide, whereas the California operator was First Element Fuel, a startup formed specifically to provide hydrogen for the upcoming crop of fuel-cell vehicles.

In May, Toyota loaned First Element $7.3 million toward the costs of building 19 hydrogen fueling stations in southern California.

The planned fueling network in the Northeast comprises 12 ""strategically selected"" locations in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island.

Behold the First Mainstream Hydrogen Car - Outside,"Wed, 19 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm91dHNpZGVvbmxpbmUuY29tL291dGRvb3ItZ2Vhci90b29scy9iZWhvbGQtZmlyc3QtbWFpbnN0cmVhbS1oeWRyb2dlbi1jYXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Heading out the door?

Late next year, the Toyota Mirai will go on sale for $57,000. It will run on hydrogen—the only commercial car of its kind on the road—and emit water vapor from the tailpipe.

Hydrogen has the potential to be the world’s cleanest energy source. Even taking the process used to produce the element into account, emissions from a hydrogen-powered car are half what they would be from a gas-powered one.

At the moment, hydrogen is rarely produced and very expensive. But with the U.S. in a fracking boom, hydrogen-powered cars have a dependable fuel source—one that may make the industry a lot cleaner. Fracking gas byproducts can be used as a fuel for a car like the Mirai. When you convert the byproducts into hydrogen, you get power that offers a far greater automotive range. And by not burning the gas, you’re not sending the carbon into the atmosphere.

Still, why not just drive your Prius? The answer: a hydrogen-powered car is cleaner than the hybrid—assuming you spend a good bit of your time also running your Prius’ gas engine.

Okay, you might wonder, so why not buy an electric vehicle? Well, EVs suffer from limited charging infrastructure and range. A Nissan Leaf can only go about 80 miles per charge—and then it takes hours to recharge. The Mirai, on the other hand, can travel 300 miles on a tank of hydrogen and refuels in just a few minutes, just like your gas-powered car. To make an EV with similar range would require both a bigger car (lots of batteries), but you’d still face the long recharge wait—and a steep price tag. The Tesla Model S can travel up to 300 miles per charge, but it also costs upwards of $70,000.

Gas Up, But Where?

Okay, so a 300-mile range is great, but you probably noticed the lack of hydrogen fuel pumps. Toyota’s working with the state of California—where the Mirai rolls out late next year—to build hydrogen-fuel hubs in and around Los Angeles and Silicon Valley. (Toyota’s putting up some of the dough, and the state has pledged $200 million through 2020.) Toyota’s also promising to fund more pumps along the I-95 corridor in the northeast U.S.

Currently, most EV drivers use any number of apps (these come from carmakers and are readily available online) to find fast charging stations and diesel pumps. For early Mirai adopters, the experience will be the same—you’ll have a regular circuit of pumps to use. As a bonus, all that fuel will be free at the start. During the first three years of ownership (Toyota thinks most customers will opt for the three-year, $499/month lease rather than buy the cars), all hydrogen will be free.

There’s a push-pull with any new technology. Toyota acknowdledges that they’re stepping out on a limb with the Mirai, but say that when they introduced the Prius in 1997, it wasn’t an instant hit. The first one million Priuses took a decade to sell, but since 2007, seven million have sold. Granted, the Prius never had the same infrastructure impediments as the Mirai—you can gas up your Prius anywhere.

But the hydrogen pumps will come. And the end goal isn’t just to keep refining natural gas, says Ole Hofelmann, CEO of hydrogen supplier Air Liquide. In five years, Hofelmann says his company will have rolled out hydrogen production from renewable energy like solar, wind—and even garbage. In Orange County, where the Mirai launched Tuesday, a wastewater treatment plant converts the methane captured from sewage directly into hydrogen. Methane is a very volatile greenhouse gas— capturing it and converting it to fuel that emits nothing in your Mirai is the sort of energy-from-nothing miracle Toyota’s trying to sell with this car.

More likely is California’s plan to convert wind power into hydrogen. This is key to making wind (and solar) cheaper, since at present there’s no way to store the energy when demand is low. Convert it to hydrogen, however, and you create a battery model, either to run a power plant—or to sell to consumers who drive hydrogen-powered cars.

So How Does the Mirai Drive?

We had a limited test at the wheel of the Mirai, but we’ll say this—it’s a more natural driving, natural-feeling car than the Prius. Acceleration is smooth and the car’s very quick. Note that the powertrain is very similar to an electric car’s. The hydrogen passes through an exchange process where energy is extracted to run an electric motor. All of this happens seamlessly, and although there’s also a battery pack that’s charged (a la Prius), actually motoring away from a stoplight or merging onto the interstate is liquid-glass smooth. Likewise, the steering-feel is a bit less robotic than in the Prius, and because the hydrogen tanks, motor, and compressor (needed to stuff more hydrogen into each carbon-fiber tank) are all low in the car, it handles adroitly.

Short answer: It’s no sports car, but it’s surprisingly fun and agile. Like finding vegan meals that taste great, the Mirai belies its eco credentials with a lot more spunk than you’d expect.

Toyota also says you can use your car as a portable power station. While they didn’t elaborate, the idea is that you can draw DC power back out of the Mirai to either power your home during a storm-induced outage—or to run juice from it to, say, an air mattress inflator at the beach or your boom box when you’re car camping with the groms.

Yeah, But Who’s Buying?

The sticker price is steep, and the impediments to ownership of any hydrogen car are still substantial. Silicon Valley types and L.A. creative folks are almost surely going to be the first hand raisers. You’d need a steady job and a steady commute cycle to want this car, but as with any “out-there” tech, scarcity alone will make this a wannabe’s hot rod.

Then what? Mirai means “future,” in Japanese. The question remains whether after the buzz cools, Toyota can manage to mainstream the Mirai so that it’s no longer a novelty, but the kind of car we all want to own."
"Toyota's New Fuel Cell Car Is Called Mirai, Produces Water Vapor When Driven - Softpedia News","Mon, 17 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5zb2Z0cGVkaWEuY29tL25ld3MvVG95b3RhLXMtTmV3LUZ1ZWwtQ2VsbC1DYXItSXMtQ2FsbGVkLU1pcmFpLVByb2R1Y2VzLVdhdGVyLVZhcG9yLVdoZW4tRHJpdmVuLTQ2NTEwNi5zaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This past Sunday, Akio Toyoda, president and member of the board of Toyota Motor, announced to the world that the company's new fuel cell car would from then on be known as Mirai. The announcement was made in a video, available below.

In a statement issued this November 17, the automotive manufacturer details that this name was chosen because, in Japanese, it translates as “future.” Thus, the moniker is Toyota's way of saying that this sedan is one-of-a-kind ride and a turning point for the car-making industry.

“Akio Toyoda has seen the future, and it’s called 'Mirai,'” the Toyota Motor Corporation writes. “Mirai, which means 'future' in Japanese, represents a turning point for the automotive industry,” it further stresses.

What's so special about this car?

The Japanese automotive manufacturer explains that, seeing how it is a fuel cell sedan, its Mirai produces no greenhouse gas emissions whatsoever. On the contrary, the only thing that it coughs out when up and running is water vapor.

True, the world is no stranger to fuel cell vehicles. Still, Toyota argues that its Mirai is by far one of the coolest fuel cell cars ever to come out of a factory line. Thus, it says that the sedan can cover 300 miles (483 kilometers) on a single tank and refuel in under 5 minutes.

As detailed by President Akio Toyoda, the fuel cell that the Mirai is fitted with produces enough electricity to power an entire house for about a week. What's more, the President maintains that, high-tech equipment aside, the sedan is very easy to maneuver and even fun to drive.

“This is a car that lets you have it all with no compromises. For us, this isn’t just another car. This is an opportunity – an opportunity to really make a difference. And making a difference is what Toyota is all about,” Akio Toyoda said in a statement.

When will the Mirai hit roads?

It is understood that the Mirai will be introduced in five northeastern US states sometime in 2016. To make sure that the project will be a successful one, the Toyota Motor Corporation will see to it that several hydrogen stations are installed in targeted regions in the months to come.

Thus, the automotive manufacturer and Air Liquide expect that, by the time the fuel cell sedan hits roads in this part of the country, as many as 12 hydrogen stations will be up and running in New York, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Connecticut.

It is to be expected that, should folks in the region take a liking to the Mirai, several other hydrogen stations will be installed in this corner in the US in the years to come. The move will surely help reduce dangerous emissions resulting from traffic.

Commenting on this collaboration with Air Liquide, Jim Lentz with the Toyota Motor Corporation wished to stress that, “Toyota’s vision of a hydrogen society is not just about building a great car, but ensuring accessible, reliable and convenient refueling for our customers.”"
Niger allegedly second-guessing Chad-Cameroon pipeline - Business in Cameroon,"Wed, 26 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5jYW1lcm9vbi5jb20vZW5lcmd5LzI2MTEtNTE0NC1uaWdlci1hbGxlZ2VkbHktc2Vjb25kLWd1ZXNzaW5nLWNoYWQtY2FtZXJvb24tcGlwZWxpbmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Business in Cameroon) - Niger may abandon its plan to build a pipeline that would connect to the Chad-Cameroon pipeline to pipe crude oil to the Kribi deep water port. This was revealed in the “La Lettre du continent” publication. Behind Niger’s doubts are “the growing insecurity at its borders and the permanent threat of the fundamentalist sect, Boko Haram, in the Lake Chad region.”

Niger authorities are allegedly considering a new option – building the pipeline to Benin instead – “a less exposed country”. This new option has the advantage of “fitting into the vast West-African rail project” but would be more costly. If the Chad-Cameroon prospect is abandoned, the new budget would double as, in addition to the pipeline in Niger, the Beninese pipeline would also have to be built.

However, for the time being, the Niger government has not yet decided, but the case is being examined by the “oil sector officials in Niger, starting with Minister Energy and Oil, Foumagoye Gado”. It was he who signed the bilateral agreement on October 30, 2013 which fixes the conditions surrounding the Chad-Cameroon pipeline transit on Cameroonian soil.

“Niger’s production is not significant. It is currently 60,000 barrels per day and so, to make it worthwhile, we needed to choose the shortest route possible to make it less costly. With the Chad-Cameroon pipeline, we only need to build 600 km pipeline to do the connection,” explained the Niger Minister of Energy and Oil. If Niger abandons the first option, it will be a sizeable financial loss for Cameroon as the transit of Niger oil is brings in revenue to Cameroon’s Treasury in the form of transit royalties.

The transit royalty was set at October 29, 2013, moving from 195 FCFA (0.41 USD) per barrel to 618 FCFA (1.30 USD) per barrel. This enabled Cameroon’s Treasury to rake in 6.5 billion FCFA for the first four months of 2014, which is the equivalent generated by the same transit fee over a period of 11 months in 2013."
"Toyota dévoile ""Mirai"", voiture du futur roulant à l'hydrogène - L'Express","Tue, 18 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxleHByZXNzLmZyL2Vjb25vbWllL3RveW90YS1sYW5jZS1taXJhaS12ZWhpY3VsZS1kdS1mdXR1ci1yb3VsYW50LWEtbC1oeWRyb2dlbmVfMTYyMzA0MC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Avant cette voiture dont le nom signifie ""futur"" en japonais, des modèles basés sur une technologie similaire ont été mis sur le marché, mais jamais à une telle échelle.

Publicité

Le groupe espère en vendre 400 d'ici à fin 2015 au Japon, de 50 à 100 annuellement en Europe (Royaume-Uni, Allemagne et Danemark dans un premier temps) et plus de 3.000 aux Etats-Unis avant fin 2017.

""Nous ne sommes qu'au début"" de l'aventure, a déclaré le vice-président Mitsuhisa Kato lors de la conférence de lancement, organisée en grande pompe au Musée national des sciences et de la technologie de Tokyo (Miraikan).

Toyota espère ensuite accélérer le rythme et ambitionne d'en écouler ""des dizaines de milliers dans les années 2020"".

Mirai, berline qui peut parcourir 650 km avec un seul plein effectué en trois minutes est alimentée par une pile à combustible à base d'hydrogène, sur le principe de l'électrolyse inversée: de l'électricité est générée en faisant passer dans un circuit des électrons extirpés d'atomes d'hydrogène.

Ces derniers se combinent ensuite avec l'oxygène de l'air pour former de l'eau, seule émission produite par le véhicule, a détaillé Toyota, qui décrit Mirai comme ""le modèle par excellence de la voiture propre"".

Le numéro un mondial de l'automobile a déjà fait figure de pionnier dans l'hybride. Il a vendu plus de 7 millions d'unités fonctionnant avec la double motorisation essence et électricité, dont la Prius, depuis leurs débuts en 1997.

- Manque d'infrastructures -

Outre la carte écolo, la dernière née de Toyota ""offre le même service en terme d'autonomie qu'un véhicule classique"", alors qu'""avec un pur véhicule électrique, on est limité de façon forte"", explique Jean-François Gruson, expert à l'institut IFP Energies nouvelles, interrogé à Paris. Le temps de charge est lui aussi comparable aux voitures à essence.

Le prix risque cependant d'être un frein: 6,7 millions de yens dans l'archipel nippon, 57.500 dollars aux Etats-Unis et 66.000 euros en Europe (hors taxe), prévient Hans Greimel, correspondant en Asie du magazine américain Automotive News.

Autre facteur dissuasif, le manque de stations de recharge. ""C'est la problématique classique de l'oeuf et de la poule: personne ne veut acheter les voitures parce qu'il n'y a pas d'infrastructures"", et vice versa, relève-t-il.

Les ventes se concentreront donc dans les régions les mieux dotées. Au Japon, elles sont actuellement 40, dans les environs des grandes agglomérations de Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka et Fukuoka.

En Californie, elles devraient être 48 fin 2016 et dans le nord-est des Etats-Unis 12 à la même période, construites par le spécialiste des gaz industriels, Air Liquide, en partenariat avec Toyota.

En Europe, le groupe français a installé plusieurs bornes au Danemark et en Allemagne notamment, tandis qu'en France, le marché est ""balbutiant"", selon M. Gruson.

Toyota développe des véhicules à pile à combustible depuis plus de 20 ans, utilisés en interne. En 2002, il est allé plus loin en proposant en leasing un SUV de ce type sur une base limitée au Japon et aux Etats-Unis.

Son concurrent et compatriote Honda Motor, qui a vendu par le passé un modèle similaire, mais en très peu d'exemplaires, prévoit de lancer à son tour une voiture utilisant cette technologie d'ici à mars 2016.

Nissan planche aussi sur le sujet, de même que des constructeurs étrangers, comme le sud-coréen Hyundai.

""L'hydrogène est une ressource inépuisable qui peut être stockée et transportée facilement"", souligne Toyota, qui espère plus largement ""contribuer à l'instauration d'une société"" basée sur cette énergie prometteuse.

Petit bémol cependant, si l'hydrogène n'émet pas de CO2 depuis la voiture, sa production, elle, en génère dans la plupart des cas. Elément le plus abondant sur Terre, il ne se trouve pas séparément à l'état naturel."
Peugeot Speedfight 4 : le sportif évolue pour 2015 - Scooter System,"Tue, 04 Nov 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjb290ZXItc3lzdGVtLmZyL25ld3MvMjMzNi1wZXVnZW90LXNwZWVkZmlnaHQ0Lmh0bWzSATBodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY29vdGVyLXN5c3RlbS5mci9uZXdzL2FtcC0yMzM2Lmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Peugeot a profité du salon EICMA qui se tient à Milan pour présenter en première mondiale son nouveau scooter 50cm3 sportif. Après 500 000 unités vendues depuis 1996, cette 4ème génération de Speedfight marque de profonds changements. Côté esthétique bien sûr, mais aussi performances et agrément.

Nous couvrons actuellement le salon EICMA de Milan à travers un Live Tweet riche en infos et photos. Malgré un planning chargé, nous avons souhaité partager avec vous la première mondiale présentée cet après-midi sur le stand du français Peugeot Scooters : le Speedfight 4. Près de 6 ans après le lancement de son aînée, cette nouvelle version s'inscrit dans la continuité tout en étant davantage accessible.



Le Speedfight 4 est le nouveau scooter 50cm3 sportif de Peugeot

Si l'air de famille est indéniable sous certaines coutures, la face avant marque une rupture avec les générations précédentes. Elle dit adieu à son nez pointu surmonté d'énormes feux en amandes, qui cèdent leur place à une plastique assagie et, du coup, un peu moins sportive. Les fameuses prises d'air sur les flancs, l'aileron aérodynamique ou le bas de caisse avec sabot intégré sont en revanche toujours là.

Côté châssis, le scooter 50cc reste proche de la version 3. Il conserve notamment son réservoir de carburant (de 8L) en position centrale, qui rabaisse le centre de gravité pour offrir une meilleure tenue de route. Sa fourche hydraulique de Ø 32 mm améliore le confort alors que pour freiner son scooter de 100 kilos, Peugeot a opté pour et un disque de frein Shuricane de Ø 215 mm et un étrier radial à 4 pistons.



À l'avant, la roue de 13'' est assortie d'un beau disque en pétale de 215 mm

Pour séduire un large panel de scootéristes, Peugeot a équipé son Speedfight 4 de trois motorisations : du 2 temps à refroidissement par air forcé et liquide et du 4 temps. Grâce à l'adoption d'un nouveau carburateur Dell'Orto, les 2 premiers gagnent nettement en performances, et plus particulièrement en couple. On parle de 10% pour le AC et 15% pour le LC, soit un joli 5.5 Nm contre 4.8 auparavant.

Le dernier point d'amélioration concerne le niveau d'équipement, qui monte en gamme. Nous avons particulièrement apprécié le compteur multifonctions digital, qui distille les informations habituelles dans un format compact et lisible. Ou encore la prise électrique en 12V, qui permet de recharger un smartphone ou baladeur multimédia en roulant. Sans oublier l'optique haute-visibilité de 2 x 35 Watts.



Le Speedfight 4 affiche un nouveau regard qui n'est pas pour nous déplaire

Si le confort de conduite a évolué, le passager sera lui aussi à son aise grâce à des cales-pieds amovibles en alu et une large sellerie étagée. Cette dernière renferme toujours un coffre au volume généreux (il avale un casque intégral) et est fournie avec un dosseret amovible. Nous reviendrons vers vous dès que les prix du Speedfight 4 seront connus. Soit d'ici début 2015, date de sortie annoncée !
