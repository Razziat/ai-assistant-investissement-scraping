The PEM electrolyzer: a giant leap for low-carbon hydrogen - Air Liquide,"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvaW5kdXN0cnkvcGVtLWVsZWN0cm9seXplci1naWFudC1sZWFwLWxvdy1jYXJib24taHlkcm9nZW7SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide has recently finalized the construction of the world’s largest PEM (Proton Exchange Membrane) electrolyzer, equipped with CUMMINS technology, which marks a major step in the Group’s commitment to producing low-carbon hydrogen on an industrial scale. Why is this a key step? Below are all the answers to your questions (and much more).

The hydrogen energy economy took a decisive step forward in 2020. This year marked an unprecedented acknowledgment of the interest that hydrogen represents in the quest to achieve a successful transition to a low-carbon society.

More than 15 European, Asian and North America countries have included hydrogen in their national strategies with major stimulus plans. In order to produce this hydrogen with a minimal carbon footprint, one solution consists of separating the water molecule (H 2 O) by using renewable electricity: and that is where the water electrolysis process comes into play.

This technology is simple and has been around for a long time. However, its costs have remained high for a long period of time, slowing its adoption and thus its development. The upturn in renewable energies and the decrease in the accompanying cost price is a game changer: it paves the way for the deployment of electrolysis for the production of low-carbon hydrogen on an industrial scale. With a daily production capacity of 8.2 tons, Air Liquide’s new site in Bécancour (Canada) is proof of this.

Let’s take a look at four points that make its commissioning a major step:

1. It demonstrates the viability of stepping up this PEM technology to an industrial scale

PEM (Proton Exchange Membrane) technology is particularly interesting for the production of low-carbon hydrogen as its functioning is able to better adapt to the fluctuations in available energy - and therefore to the intermittent nature of renewable energies - than other technologies.

One of the regular barriers to the deployment of new technologies is the ability to replicate an experimental model within large-scale production. This was one of the challenges facing this PEM technology. Thanks to the site inaugurated in Quebec, Air Liquide demonstrates that it can be rolled out on a large scale, and that the power of each site can easily be adapted to local resources. The 20 MW power of the Bécancour facility is based on the addition of four distinct units of 5 MW each. That is why it is technically possible to increase the generation capacity of a site by adding additional electrolyzers."
Itochu and France's Air Liquide to build giant hydrogen plant - Nikkei Asia,"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vYXNpYS5uaWtrZWkuY29tL1Nwb3RsaWdodC9FbnZpcm9ubWVudC9DbGltYXRlLUNoYW5nZS9JdG9jaHUtYW5kLUZyYW5jZS1zLUFpci1MaXF1aWRlLXRvLWJ1aWxkLWdpYW50LWh5ZHJvZ2VuLXBsYW500gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TOKYO -- Japanese trading house Itochu has partnered with Air Liquide, a French industrial gas supplier, to develop a liquid hydrogen plant in central Japan which, when complete, will be one of the world's largest, the Nikkei has learned.

The plant, which is scheduled for completion in the mid-2020s, is aimed at accelerating the adoption of hydrogen as a clean form of energy in Japan. The plant will produce liquid hydrogen out of liquefied natural gas, offering it as fuel for power generation and fuel-cell vehicles, sources said.

The move is in step with the energy strategy set out by Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's government, which is promoting hydrogen as an important substitute for conventional fuels.

The strategy calls for as much as 3 million tons of hydrogen to be produced annually by 2030 and underlines the need to develop production capacity.

Output of liquid hydrogen in Japan totals about 44 tons a day, of which Iwatani, a gas wholesaler, produces 70%. The new plant will bring the Itochu-Air Liquide partnership on par with Iwatani in terms of capacity.

Itochu and Air Liquide recently signed a strategic partnership agreement aimed at developing a new gas supply network in Japan. The plant built by the partners will be able to make around 30 tons of liquid hydrogen a day, enough to power 42,000 fuel cell vehicles. The size of the investment will be finalized next year.

The plant is expected to be about the same size as the one Air Liquide is building in the U.S. state of Nevada at a cost of around $187 million. The Nevada plant, when completed, will be the world's largest such plant.

At present, hydrogen costs around 100 yen per cubic meter to produce. The government aims to bring that down to 30 yen by 2030. Hydrogen has not been widely used as a fuel up to now, due mainly to its high cost. The giant plant is designed to help resolve this cost issue. Currently, liquid hydrogen trades for 1,100 yen per kilogram in the wholesale market.

Electricity produced with hydrogen costs 52 yen per kilowatt-hour, double the prevailing rates in Japan. The Itochu-Air Liquide partnership aims to bring down the cost of liquid hydrogen to 1,000 yen or less per kilogram.

The plant will produce hydrogen by separating LNG into hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The CO2 generated during production will be collected and sold to industrial customers. Hydrogen stations for cars are envisaged as the main customers for the fuel. As of December, there were 137 hydrogen stations in Japan, which the Suga government hopes to raise to 900 by 2030.

The two companies also envisage using liquid hydrogen for other purposes, including thermal power generation, steelmaking and petrochemical production. The ""Hydrogen Strategy"" released by the European Commission in July calls for producing hydrogen through electrolysis of water, so as not to produce carbon emissions. The EU aims to bring down the cost of hydrogen to 300 to 700 yen per kilogram by increasing hydrogen consumption to 10 million tons by 2030.

Japan already has one of the world's largest hydrogen plants. The plant, located in Fukushima, produces the fuel with renewable energy, but the main drawback is its high production cost. Bringing the cost of hydrogen down to a level the EU aims for is expected to take time in Japan, and Itochu has decided to prioritize fossil fuel-based production for now.

Air Liquide is one of the largest hydrogen producers in the world, along with Germany's Linde. In the year ended in December, the French company posted a net profit of 2.4 billion euros ($2.9 billion) on revenue of 20.4 billion euros. The company operates some 120 hydrogen stations out of the world's total of 500. In Japan, the company operates 13 stations and plans to add four more in 2022."

Outstanding performance from the Group in 2020 that demonstrates the strength of its business model - Air Liquide,"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5haXJsaXF1aWRlLmNvbS9ncm91cC9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy1uZXdzLzIwMjEtMDItMTAvb3V0c3RhbmRpbmctcGVyZm9ybWFuY2UtZ3JvdXAtMjAyMC1kZW1vbnN0cmF0ZXMtc3RyZW5ndGgtaXRzLWJ1c2luZXNzLW1vZGVs0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Significant contribution to the fight against covid-19

Sales resilience, significant margin improvement and net profit growth

Well positioned for future growth

Commenting on the results for 2020, Benoît Potier, Air Liquide Chairman and CEO, stated:

“The Group was fully mobilized to serve its customers and patients in 2020, which was an out of the ordinary year, whilst being resolutely committed to the fight against covid-19.

I want to recognize the exceptional work accomplished by all the Air Liquide’s teams.

The Group‘s performance was outstanding in this environment: sales resilience, significant margin improvement, net profit growth and investment decisions continued at a very high level. This performance illustrates the solidity of our business model. It also perfectly positions the Group for future growth and enables it to already benefit from the acceleration seen in healthcare, energy transition, and the increasing presence of technologies, in particular digital, in all sectors.

Over the full year, 2020 sales were practically stable on a comparable basis, with business back to growth in the fourth quarter. The Gas & Services sales, which account for 96% of Group revenue, held up well, as did Global Markets & Technologies which retained their momentum. On a comparable basis, business was supported by strong sales growth in Healthcare and Electronics. Geographically, the situation was extremely varied with Europe faring well, driven by demand in Healthcare, and a solid performance from the developing economies, particularly China, and Eastern European and Latin American countries.

The Group’s operating margin improvement plan, combined with exceptional cost containment measures relating to the situation in 2020, resulted in a marked improvement in the margin of +80 bps excluding energy impact. The structural efficiencies stood at 441 million euros. Operating cash flows were high and the debt-to-equity ratio was reduced significantly. The Group’s balance sheet confirms its strength.

The Group has achieved, as of 2019, the sales and efficiencies objectives of its NEOS 2020 company program. As for the ROCE of 10%+, it is maintained, with target achievement by 2023-2024 to take into account the impact of the covid-19 crisis as well as the pro-active investment policy in the current favorable context. In 2020, investment decisions thus stood at the extremely high level of 3.2 billion euros, indicative of future growth.

In an environment marked by global recovery plans and commitment to energy transition, the Group still has numerous investment opportunities of which 44% are projects related to the fight against climate change, including the development of Hydrogen Energy.

In 2021, in a context of limited local lockdowns in the first half of the year and recovery in the second half, Air Liquide is confident in its ability to further increase its operating margin and to deliver recurring net profit[1] growth, at constant exchange rates. ”

2020 Highlights Crisis management: Rapid adaptation to the crisis for the entire organization: implementation of strict health standards allowing business continuity, development of homeworking.

Group revenue for 2020 totaled 20,485 million euros, almost flat on a comparable basis compared with 2019, at -1.3%, in a context of global health and economic crisis. The business model thus demonstrated its robustness, supported by the Group’s global presence and the diversity and balance of its portfolio between growth businesses and resilient sectors. Engineering & Construction consolidated revenue, which was down -23% over the year, enjoyed a strong +24.1% increase in the 4th quarter. Global Markets & Technologies was up +6.0%, with a dynamic momentum in biogas with the start-up of new units. Group revenue as published was down -6.5% due to negative currency (-2.0%), energy (-1.8%), and significant scope (-1.4%) impacts.

Gas & Services revenue totaled 19,656 million euros, very close to 2019 on a comparable basis, at -1.2%. Sales as published were down -6.6% in 2020, affected by unfavorable currency (-2.1%), energy (-1.9%) and significant scope (-1.4%) impacts. The significant scope impact mainly reflects the disposal of Schülke in Healthcare.

Gas & Services revenue in the Americas totaled 7,799 million euros in 2020, a decline of -3.7% on a comparable basis. In North America, sales started improving sequentially in the 3 rd quarter but remained down compared with 2019. Sales were up markedly in Latin America in 2020, mainly driven by a start-up in Large Industries in Argentina and strong demand for medical oxygen. Large Industries revenue in the region was up +1.4%. Industrial Merchant saw a strong sequential recovery over the 2 nd half of the year, but annual revenue remained down by -7.1%. Healthcare is still fully committed to the fight against the pandemic notably with the supply of medical oxygen, and posted annual sales growth of +7.7%. Electronics posted solid growth of +5.2%.

With comparable growth up +1.3% in 2020, sales in Europe reached 6,826 million euros . Industrial activities, which were particularly affected by the public health crisis from mid-March, started to recover from the beginning of May and markedly accelerated its recovery during the second half of the year. Large Industries sales were down by -1.0% over the year. Industrial Merchant recovered during the 2 nd half of the year, but its annual revenue, which was down -5.6%, remains impacted by the crisis. Healthcare activities were strongly mobilized in the fight against Covid-19, and posted revenue growth of +9.7% over the year.

Revenue in Asia-Pacific remained stable ( -0.1% ) in 2020 on a comparable basis, and stood at 4,467 million euros , with all industrial activities posting growth during the 4 th quarter. China (+3.4%) brought a strong contribution thanks to a quick recovery across all activities. The recovery was slower in the rest of the region. Large Industries (+0.2%) was driven by the ramp-up of a unit in South Korea. Industrial Merchant (-3.6%) remained sluggish, despite the strong recovery in sales in China during the 2 nd half of the year. Electronics (+3.6%) momentum was very dynamic with growth exceeding +10% over the year excluding Equipment & Installation sales.

Comparable growth was down -2.6% in 2020 in the Middle East and Africa , and revenues reached 564 million euros . Following a customer turnaround at the beginning of the year, Large Industries sales were up during the 2nd half of the year. Industrial Merchant revenue, which was strongly hit by the Covid-19 crisis during the 2nd quarter, saw a return to growth during the 4th quarter. Healthcare is committed to the fight against Covid-19 and posted strong growth across the region.

Healthcare was fully committed to ensuring the supply of oxygen to hospitals to treat Covid-19 patients and posted significant comparable growth of +8.5% for 2020. Electronics also recorded a very solid growth of +3.9% and +7.9% excluding Equipment & Installations sales. Large Industries sales remained stable in 2020 at -0.1% despite the public health context. Industrial Merchant sales were down -6.3% on a comparable basis, negatively impacted by the crisis but supported by solid pricing impacts of +2.6% and growth in several developing economies.

Consolidated Engineering & Construction revenue stood at 250 million euros for 2020, with a sharp increase of +24% in the 4th quarter. Third-party customer sales were down -23% over the year, reflecting the slowdown due to the public health crisis whereas total sales saw a more moderate decline of -9% for the year. Order intake for 2020 reached

820 million euros.

Global Markets & Technologies revenue for 2020 reached 579 million euros, representing growth of +6.0% during a period marked by the public health crisis, driven by the biogas activity. Order intake for Group projects and third-party customers totaled 598 million euros, representing a dynamic increase of +14.3%.

Structural Efficiencies reached 441 million euros for 2020 and largely exceeded the annual objective which had been set at more than 400 million euros. Moreover, exceptional cost reductions under the public health crisis response plan were due to the low level of activity and are not, due to their nature, sustainable in the long-term.

The Group’s operating income recurring (OIR) amounted to 3,790 million euros in 2020, stable as published (-0.1%) but up +3.6% on a comparable basis versus 2019. The operating margin (OIR to revenue) stood at 18.5%, marking a strong improvement of +120 basis points compared with 2019 and of +80 basis points excluding the energy impact. Gas & Services operating margin as published stood at 20.4%, an improvement of +130 basis points compared with 2019, and of +90 basis points excluding the energy impact.

Despite the pandemic, net profit (Group share) amounted to 2,435 million euros in 2020, a significant increase of +8.6% as published and of +11.2% excluding the currency impact. Net earnings per share at 5.16 euros, were up significantly (+8.5%) compared with 2019, in line with the increase in net profit (Group share).

Cash flow from operating activities before changes in net working capital totaled 4,932 million euros, representing an increase of +1.5% despite a slowdown in activity due to the public health crisis, and once again underlining the resilience of the business model. This corresponds to a record high of 24.1% of sales, a marked improvement of +190 basis points compared with 2019. Working capital requirement (WCR) decreased significantly, by 364 million euros compared with December 31, 2019.

Gross industrial capital expenditure reached 2,630 million euros and was stable overall compared with 2019. This represented 12.8% of sales, reflecting strong project developments despite the public health crisis. Proceeds from sale of assets were exceptionally high in 2020 at 800 million euros and notably included the disposal of the Schülke. The net debt-to-equity ratio stood at 55.8%, a marked decrease compared with the end of 2019.

Industrial investment decisions were higher than 3.0 billion euros for the second year in a row despite the challenging public health context. The 12-month portfolio of investment opportunities stood at 3.1 billion euros at the end of December, with several new entries during the 4th quarter. The type of opportunities has changed significantly and the energy transition represents 44% of the portfolio.

The additional contribution to sales of unit start-ups and ramp-ups totaled 191 million euros in 2020 despite the public health crisis. The additional contribution to 2021 sales of unit start-ups and ramp-ups should reach around 250 million euros. The 16 units that are currently being acquired in South Africa should bring an additional contribution estimated at around 100 million euros for 2021 in a first phase, sales should then exceed 400 million euros per year during a second phase, when energy management will be fully integrated, without any significant impact on operating income.

The return on capital employed after tax (ROCE) was 9.0% in 2020. Recurring ROCE[2] stood at 8.6%, stable compared with 2019 despite the decline in business due to the public health crisis.

Air Liquide’s Board of Directors, which met on February 9, 2021, approved the audited financial statements for the 2020 fiscal year. The Statutory Auditors are in the process of issuing a report with an unqualified opinion.

At the next Annual General Meeting, the Board of Directors will propose the payment of a dividend of 2.75 euros per share, up +1.9% compared to prior year and in line with the recurring net profit growth. The ex-dividend date has been set for May 17, 2021 and the payment is scheduled for May 19, 2021. In addition, the Board of Directors has decided to allot again one free share for every 10 shares. This allotment is considered for June 2022.

Project description: YCI Methanol One LLC (YCI), a subsidiary of a venture company between Yuhuang Chemical Industries Inc. (YCII) and Koch Methanol Investments LLC, is constructing a world-scale Mega Methanol methane-to methanol production facility on 1,300 acres along the west side of the Mississippi River near River Road in St. James Parish.

Project cost: $1.85 billion

Start date: Spring 2017

Expected completion date: May 2021

Owner/Developer: YCI Methanol One, LLC (YCI)

Construction Teams: Air Liquide Global E&C Solutions; Wood Group, with a number of other local and area contractors

Methanol is used in the manufacturing of countless everyday products, from plywood to carpet and fuels to plastics.

In St. James Parish, a $1.85 Air Liquide Mega Methanol methane-to-methanol production facility on 1,300 acres is being built along the west side of the Mississippi River near River Road.

It will have a productive capacity of approximately 1.7 million metric tons of methanol per year and convert, daily 146,000 MMBtu of natural gas into 4,950 metric tons of methanol.

YCI Methanol One is a venture company between Yuhuang Chemical Industries Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shandong Yuhuang Chemical Co. Ltd. and Koch Methanol Investments LLC. The project is the largest green field investment in methanol by a Chinese company in Louisiana.

The original expected date for the plant to get its first shipment out was late 2020. However, the company has pushed back that date to begin operations in the second quarter of 2021.

“The company has represented to Louisiana Economic Development that it plans to begin operations in St. James Parish by May 2021,” states Gary Perilloux, communications director for LED.

The company declined to provide information about its updated plans.

“At this point in time, we don’t have more to share beyond our interview last year,” said Christin Fernandez, director of communications for Koch Industries. Charlie Yao, CEO of YCI, also declined to comment.

The company received pushback from residents at a public meeting in September 2020 after the plant owner sought state permission to dump treated wastewater into the Mississippi River and to release rainfall runoff and sewer effluent into the St. James Canal, as reported by The Advocate.

The newspaper reported that officials with YCI Methanol said that the complex would have the latest controls and regular monitoring to ensure discharges into the Mississippi and the canal wouldn’t exceed state and federal health and safety standards.

The St. James Parish Council’s overview of its 2019 budget notes the facility and its economic contributions to the parish.

“The capital-intensive portion of Yuhuang Chemical’s $1.85 billion methanol facility is well underway, with the expectation of substantial construction-related sales tax collections during 2019 and 2020,” the report states.

At a Feb. 24, 2020 planning committee meeting, Plains Marketing in St. James Parish submitted plans to install industrial railroad track and turnouts in support of the facility, an expansion of Plains’ existing St. James Terminal, which is directly served by the Union Pacific Railroad.

The YCI plant website states that both state-of-the-art truck and rail terminals are being built adjacent to the methanol plant. A marine dock has been built on the Mississippi River giving YCI Methanol One the ability to load 10,000-barrel and 30,000-barrel barges, as well as typical ocean-going vessels.

A world premiere

The new electrolyzer, located at Air Liquide's site in Bécancour, features four distinct units that use PEM (ProtonExchange Membrane) technology to generate 20 megawatts of power in total. This is the largest unit of its kind currently operating in the world. In concrete terms, the PEM electrolyzer makes it possible to produce hydrogen from water electrolysis using electricity generated by renewable technologies. This impressive breakthrough demonstrates Air Liquide's ability to roll out promising technological solutions designed to produce low-carbon hydrogen on an industrial scale. The site also includes a test bed for the next generation of electrolyzers under development and is now a satellite of Air Liquide's Campus Innovation'link) site in Delaware.

Unprecedented production capacity...

Powered by 99% renewable energy from Hydro-Québec, this unit can produce over 8.2 metric tons of low-carbon hydrogen per day. That is enough to fuel over 2,000 cars, 16,000 forklifts, 275 buses, or 230 large trucks. This production capacity makes it possible to supply the Group's North American customers with decarbonized, high-purity hydrogen and help reduce their carbon footprint.

...To meet the growing demand for low-carbon hydrogen

Opened in 1987, the Canada Air Liquide factory in Bécancour produces hydrogen gas and liquid hydrogen for industrial customers in Canada and the United States. With the construction of the new electrolyzer, the company's facilities in Quebec have increased their hydrogen production capacity by 50%, allowing them to respond to the growing demand for low-carbon hydrogen in the North American market, whether for industrial uses or mobility purposes.

Reducing carbon intensity

Compared to a traditional hydrogen production process, this new production unit will prevent the release of nearly 27,000 metric tons of CO2 per year, or the equivalent of the annual emissions of around 10,000 cars. With this large-scale project, Air Liquide is reaffirming its goal to produce 100% low-carbon or renewable hydrogen for mobility needs by 2030. It also confirms its long-term commitment to generalize the use of hydrogen as a clean energy vector and reaches yet another milestone along the path towards a low-carbon society.

A super-sized project completed in record time

The PEM electrolyzer in Bécancour would not have been possible without an exceptional mobilization of human resources. Through 40,000 hours of work on the build site and 20,000 hours of engineering, project management, safety inspection, and supervision, the project was made operational in under two years.

IndianOil selects American firm Dastur for India's largest industrial carbon capture and utilization project - pv magazine India,"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wdi1tYWdhemluZS1pbmRpYS5jb20vMjAyMS8wMi8xNy9pbmRpYW5vaWwtc2VsZWN0cy1hbWVyaWNhbi1maXJtLWRhc3R1ci1mb3ItaW5kaWFzLWxhcmdlc3QtaW5kdXN0cmlhbC1jYXJib24tY2FwdHVyZS1hbmQtdXRpbGl6YXRpb24tcHJvamVjdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL) has chosen US-based Dastur International as the leading partner to carry out the design and feasibility for industrial carbon capture and utilization project at its Koyali refinery with a capacity of 13.7 million tons per annum (mtpa).

The project is said to be India’s largest CCUS project. Other partners in the project are US firm Air Liquide Global E&C Solutions (Air Liquide) and the Bureau of Economic Geology (BEG) at the University of Texas at Austin.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), industrial greenhouse gases (GHG) from steel, cement, fertilizer plants and refineries make up more than a quarter of all GHGs and are practical targets for implementing CCUS. Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is a major use of CO₂ to increase an oil field’s recovery from about 40% to 70% of original oil in place, while also storing the CO₂ permanently underground.

IOCL is India’s leading refiner, operating 11 of the country’s 23 refineries. The refinery at Koyali, near Vadodara, is its flagship refinery and can capture over 5000 tonnes per day (tpd) or more than 1.5 mtpa of CO₂ for large-scale EOR operations.

The CO₂ captured from its hydrogen generation units will be primarily used for EOR at the Oil and Natural Gas Commission’s (ONGC) oilfield at Gandhar, Gujarat, near Koyali.

The project will examine the technical viability, economic cost and feasibility of capturing CO₂; develop technical specifications, designs and plans; review and identify necessary approvals and permits required; and analyze the environmental benefits of the CCUS project. In addition to EOR and food and beverage applications, it will consider various alternative applications for the captured CO₂ to make the project technically and economically feasible.

Plans

According to S.S.V. Ramakumar, Director (R&D) and Board member of IOCL, this sustainability initiative from IOCL is probably the first-of-its-kind industrial-scale carbon capture project in a large refinery in India. IOCL hopes to capture over 250-500 thousand tons of CO₂ in a year initially and to use the CO₂ for cost-effectively enhancing oil production from ONGC’s oil fields.

“In this ambitious and path-breaking project, we were pleased to receive global interest from many global firms. We are happy that Dastur Energy along with Air Liquide and the UT Austin, Bureau of Economic Geology will help us analyse and design not only a state-of-the-art commercial-scale capture system but also an economically viable model of carbon capture that can be a fore runner for CCUS in India,” he said.

The project is funded by the United States Trade and Development Agency (USTDA), as part of its mission to promote the development of sustainable infrastructure projects and fostering economic growth in partner countries like India.

“This project is an ideal example of the groundbreaking work USTDA supports and makes possible,” said Todd Abrajano, Chief Operating Officer and Head of the Agency. “This innovative solution – the first of its kind in India – is showing how American technology can help reduce GHG emissions in refinery operations while enhancing the energy security of India through EOR.”

Atanu Mukherjee, President and Chief Executive Officer of Dastur, said, “Close on the heels of our recent US Department of Energy win to implement industrial carbon capture at Arcelor Mittal Burns Harbor USA and a landmark project at a Middle East national oil major to implement carbon capture for the lowest cost EOR, I am delighted that Dastur will be able to apply its expertise along with Air Liquide and UT-BEG, to chart the path for the first CCUS project in India of this magnitude. Industrial-scale carbon capture and utilization through EOR can be an economically attractive model for India in reducing carbon emissions, enhancing energy security and contributing to the vision of an Atma Nirbhar Bharat.”

Dastur will draw upon its Austin-based affiliate Dastur Energy’s intellectual property and capabilities in the areas of energy engineering, carbon capture, EOR, energy supply chains, energy economics, and low-carbon fuels for conceiving and designing this project."
Injection Of Hydrogen Into Blast Furnace: Thyssenkrupp Steel Concludes First Test Phase Successfully - Hydrogen Central,"Thu, 04 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vaHlkcm9nZW4tY2VudHJhbC5jb20vaW5qZWN0aW9uLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLWZ1cm5hY2UtdGh5c3NlbmtydXBwLXN0ZWVsLXRlc3QtcGhhc2Utc3VjY2Vzc2Z1bGx5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"thyssenkrupp Steel has successfully completed the first phase of hydrogen tests on “Blast Furnace 9“ in Duisburg. In recent months, several tests on one of the 28 tuyères of this blast furnace could be conducted, while complying with corona requirements, among them some long-term tests.

The company has gained important findings in these tests, enabling it to extend the tests to all tuyères in the next step and to transfer this technology to large-scale industrial use. The injection tests are part of the company’s climate strategy with which it intends to reduce its CO2 emissions by 30 percent by 2030.

Successful development: Tests confirm suitability for industrial use

On November 11, 2019, thyssenkrupp Steel was the first company globally to inject hydrogen into a blast furnace during operation. Hydrogen replaces coal dust as additional reducing agent. The goal is to reduce CO2 emissions – for unlike carbon, hydrogen does not react in the blast furnace to form CO2, but water.

The project is funded under the IN4climate.NRW initiative launched by the state government, is scientifically supported by the BFI research institute and supplied with hydrogen by Air Liquide.

A particular focus of the first test phase was on findings on plant technology with the use of hydrogen. To this end, injection of hydrogen was tested on one of the 28 tuyères of “Blast furnace 9” at the Duisburg site.

Based on continual data collection and analyses during the 24-hour tests, the team was able to gather extensive information, for instance, on the positioning of the hydrogen lance in the furnace, on flow and pressure conditions and on the interaction between elevated temperatures and plant technology.

The collected data were used to optimize the hydrogen technology with each trial. It was also possible to reach the envisaged injection volume of about 1,000 m³ of hydrogen per hour in the tests.

Dr. Arnd Köfler, Chief Technology Officer of thyssenkrupp Steel:

The development of the hydrogen technology at blast furnace 9 is an important step in our transformation towards climate-neutral steel production.

“That way, we are able to reduce the CO2 emissions of the conventional coal-based blast furnace process significantly”

“We are very grateful to the state of North Rhine-Westphalia for funding this first trial phase, which has laid the foundations for the second phase now to come. This will then be followed by the next decisive step towards climate neutrality: The construction of direct reduction plants, which are purely hydrogen-based and can be operated completely without coal“.

Technical basis for extension to all tuyères completed

In the second test phase, the tests will be extended to all 28 tuyères of the blast furnace, thus paving the way for large-scale industrial use. The focus of research will then be on the impact of hydrogen technology on the metallurgical processes in the blast furnace.

The second phase is scheduled to start in 2022, somewhat later than originally planned due to the corona pandemic. While the hydrogen for the first test phase was delivered by truck, a pipeline is required for the quantities of hydrogen needed for the second phase.

The Federal Government has held out the prospect of funding for the second phase as part of the real-world laboratory program.

A preparatory agreement on the supply of hydrogen to the blast furnace via Air Liquide’s long-distance pipelines has been concluded recently. Air Liquide was already a partner in the first project phase and intends – subject to funding approval – to invest in a new pipeline connection between the blast furnace and the existing hydrogen long-distance pipeline.

Gilles Le Van, Chairman of the Management Board of Air Liquide Germany: “thyssenkrupp, and Air Liquide are working together on a lighthouse project for the hydrogen society. Together we are pushing forward the decarbonization of steelmaking – with the aim of equally addressing climate protection and international competitiveness.”

“This is important for North Rhine-Westphalia, for Germany and Europe, and we are proud to make our contribution. Air Liquide brings more than 50 years of experience in the field of hydrogen to our joint project work with thyssenkrupp. We’ll build on that”.

Medical oxygen: The fascinating journey of a life-saving gas | City Press - News24,"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MyNC5jb20vY2l0eXByZXNzL25ld3MvbWVkaWNhbC1veHlnZW4tdGhlLWZhc2NpbmF0aW5nLWpvdXJuZXktb2YtYS1saWZlLXNhdmluZy1nYXMtMjAyMTAyMTXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NEWS

Even in normal times a reliable supply of medical oxygen is an essential part of healthcare services, but during Covid-19 surges the need for this life-sustaining gas has spiked to unprecedented levels.



In hospitals across the country, being hooked up to an oxygen supply has for many literally made the difference between life and death.

Oxygen is abundantly available in the air around us, but for medical purposes (for example with high-flow nasal oxygen or mechanical ventilation) medical grade oxygen is needed.

This means oxygen that is at least 95% pure and meets the SANS532 technical standard.

How is medical oxygen isolated?

To make medical oxygen, oxygen producers take atmospheric air, filter out any dust and make sure that it is completely desiccated (dried), says Ross Hofmeyr, associate professor at the department of Anaesthesia and Peri-operative Medicine at the University of Cape Town.

“The most common source of medical oxygen is through fractional distillation (a process where air is separated) of the atmospheric air. We are all aware that our atmosphere contains just shy of 21% or about one-fifth oxygen,” he says.

“The temperature of that air is decreased close to minus 200 degrees at a pressure of five to 10 atmospheres. That causes the air, mostly containing oxygen and about four-fifths nitrogen – to liquify. And under very controlled conditions the temperature of that liquid oxygen and nitrogen mixture is raised sufficiently that the nitrogen bubbles off, leaving just the oxygen and one or two of the trace elements.”

Hofmeyr says that liquid oxygen is the most efficient way to store large volumes of oxygen – with one litre of liquid oxygen equalling around 840 litres of gaseous oxygen.

Eventually, after being stored and transported, the liquid has to be turned back into a gas that people can breathe.

This is done with vaporisers, explains Mark van der Heever, deputy director of communication at the department of health in the Western Cape.

“In order to change phase between liquid and gas, the liquid needs to boil off into a gas and this process requires additional energy which is provided by the vaporiser’s fins which absorb heat energy from the surrounding air,” he says.

“The extreme cold of the oxygen liquid causes water condensate in the outside air to freeze when it comes in contact with the vaporiser’s fins or any exposed piping and over time, the ice can build up significantly if not maintained properly. The ice then acts as an insulating layer between the liquid oxygen and the outside air, reducing the capacity of the vaporiser to change liquid oxygen into oxygen gas.”

Van der Heever says in the Western Cape, average oxygen consumption is around 15 litre per minute per patient (with Covid-19) – although this can vary wildly depending on treatment type and how the treatment is applied.

The setup at hospitals

Transported in bulk tankers, most hospitals use bulk oxygen storage in the form of liquid oxygen and with bulk tank systems, liquid oxygen is delivered and stored in a cryogenic vacuum insulated vessel which helps maintain the very low temperatures.

Hospitals can have piped or non-piped oxygen. Non-piped oxygen is normally in the form of an oxygen trolley which is fitted with a regulator and flow-metres to adjust the flow to the patient.

“In this case no existing infrastructure is required and this is generally preferred at temporary facilities and at facilities which have a very low normal demand for oxygen,” explains Van der Heever.

The piping for bulk and cylinder systems are the same and comprises a larger diameter copper pipe which gets incrementally smaller as the distance from the plant room increases.

“The reticulation is often piped in the form of a ‘loop’ where possible with multiple shut-off valves located throughout the facility in order to isolate sections for maintenance or repairs. The pipes are fed to individual service outlets which are used by clinical staff to plug devices into the system as needed,” explains Van der Heever.

Keeping up the pressure

According to Van der Heever, pressure drops can occur when the flow of oxygen exceeds the capacity of the pipes feeding the system or pressure regulating devices or when there is a shortage of oxygen to feed into the system to maintain pressure.

He says a large pressure drop can occur in one of two ways. The first scenario is when both cylinder banks have almost emptied their respective cylinders and there is very little oxygen remaining.

Our current consumption is getting lower daily and is currently already less than the first wave. In relation to our peak consumption, we therefore currently have more than 50% spare capacity. Mark van der Heever

The other scenario is that the total demand for oxygen exceeds the capacity of the pressure regulator or the reticulation system.

“Oxygen is generally supplied at high pressure at the cylinder or bulk tank and then reduced to low pressure for distribution into the reticulation system. The low pressure side is generally operated at 420 - 550 kPa depending on the reticulation system. When the pressure drops, the amount of oxygen that is delivered to patients can fall below that which is required for the ongoing medical treatment,” explains Van der Heever.

He adds that the department experienced minor pressure drops in one of their systems during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic due to the increased demand on the vaporiser and had to revert to back-up cylinders. “The problem was resolved shortly after the incident and patients were not affected,” he says.

“Possible problems were identified using our data systems and mitigated by de-icing the vaporisers more frequently, referring high-flow patients to facilities with spare bulk oxygen capacity, and increasing the vaporiser size at facilities which were consistently experiencing very high consumption in comparison to their system maximum design capacity.”

Safe handling of oxygen

Van der Heever says the major safety concern with oxygen is that it is highly pressurised like most compressed gasses and the cylinders therefore need to be securely stored and transported so it does not fall over and damage the valve on the top of the cylinder.

“Oxygen infrastructure is installed in a secured area away from the public, with only Afrox and trained maintenance personnel having access. [There are] minimum safety distances as stipulated in SANS10260-1. The other safety concern is that oxygen does support combustion, especially in higher concentrations. Leaks directly from cylinders or bulk vessels are exceptionally rare due to the stringent regulatory inspection and testing they undergo,” he explains, adding that leaks from oxygen pipes are not common but can happen if the pipes are disturbed, such as during construction or maintenance.

“When a new oxygen system is installed, it is pressure tested for 24 hours to ensure there are no leaks before the system is commissioned and this is repeated whenever a new section is added to the system. Wards and areas undergoing major maintenance are normally isolated from the oxygen reticulation system for the duration of construction. When a leak occurs, it is normally picked up while the area is still empty during the pressure testing and corrected quickly in-order to complete a successful test,” says Van der Heever explaining that oxygen points can also leak due to wear and tear and this is normally reported to the Engineering workshops who has qualified staff and parts to service and repair any problems which do come up.

Who are the suppliers

The Western Cape government gets its medical oxygen from Africa Oxygen Ltd (Afrox) in terms of a contract administered by National Treasury.

The relevant tender makes provision for different suppliers to supply medical oxygen in different parts of the country. Afrox’s main competitor in the local medical oxygen market is the company Air Liquide.

Afrox is a subsidiary of the Linde Group.

An article recently published in the Guardian contained allegations that there is a lack of competition in the market for medical oxygen in some African countries and that the Linde Group and Air Liquide are overcharging clients on the continent.

When asked if there is enough competition in the market, Van der Heever says there is a fair amount of competition between the two largest suppliers but even so, due to the vast distances covered and the impracticality of transporting oxygen over very long distances, the suppliers’ price fluctuates and longer distances mean higher prices.

“The rates depend on the delivery method but in-bulk the cost is currently R10.04/kg of condensed oxygen in the Western Cape. Deliveries and logistics are managed by the Afrox delivery team for both bulk and cylinder supply. Cylinders as well as bulk tanks are rented from the supplier,” he says, explaining that this is in-part due to regulatory requirements for testing and certification of these pressurised vessels.

Cylinders are delivered to site by Afrox and they also remove the empty cylinders for refilling and redistribution. Once empty cylinders are removed, they are pressure tested if necessary, refilled and redistributed to a new facility.

Air Liquide says they produce medical oxygen at five plants in South Africa and that the frequency of deliveries depends on demand from hospitals. “Some hospitals we used to supply once a week are now supplied daily,” says the company.

Meeting the surge in demand

As Covid-19 infections and hospitalisations surged in South Africa, first in mid-2020 and then again at the end of the year, so did the need for medical oxygen.

The Western Cape department of health’s average oxygen consumption per day pre-Covid-19 was approximately 12.2 ton per day.

The first challenge was the sheer volume of oxygen being consumed. The total volume we required in the Western Cape exceeded the total volume that the Afrox Epping plant could produce. Mark van der Heever

During the peak of the first wave consumption was approximately 35 ton per day and during the peak of the second wave consumption was at 62.2 ton per day.

Van der Heever says this excludes the use in private sector hospitals and other industries that also use oxygen such as pharmaceuticals, clinics and emergency medical services.

“Our current consumption is getting lower daily and is currently already less than the first wave. In relation to our peak consumption, we therefore currently have more than 50% spare capacity. Current Covid-19-related oxygen consumption is estimated at around 17.8 ton per day,” says Van der Heever.

Read: The evolving science behind ‘long-Covid’

As demand for medical oxygen spiked in the country, Air Liquide and Afrox both took steps to prioritise the supply of medical oxygen.

Air Liquide explains that with the necessary re-allocation of their supply chain resources to prioritise hospitals, they sent their industrial clients a “Notice of Force Majeure” to inform them of a possible interruption of oxygen deliveries.

Van der Heever says the province experienced two major challenges as demand spiked.

“The first challenge was the sheer volume of oxygen being consumed. The total volume we required in the Western Cape exceeded the total volume that the Afrox Epping plant could produce. Afrox initially started trucking in oxygen for the Garden Route facilities from the Port Elizabeth plant to avoid having to supply these facilities from the Epping plant and this was sufficient for a few weeks. Later, during the highest demand period, there were also supplemental deliveries from other plants and three additional bulk tanker trucks which help fill the facility bulk tanks.

“But the largest challenge, Van der Heever says, was the high turnover of cylinders, especially at rural facilities. This was because the overall throughput was so high and the supply of empty cylinders became an issue since the Epping plant would have to stop filling cylinders and wait for new empty ones to come in even though they had sufficient oxygen ready to go.

“This was mitigated by firstly monitoring the number of empty cylinders daily via the dashboard (an internal departmental dashboard) and directing in-house transport to collect the cylinders where there was a significant amount. Afrox has also ordered a large number of additional cylinders and converted cylinders for industrial customers for oxygen,” he says.

Spotlight sent questions to Afrox, but did not receive responses by the time of publication.
