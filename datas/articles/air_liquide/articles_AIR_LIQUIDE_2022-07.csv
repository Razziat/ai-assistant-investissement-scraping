HandivAirsity: fostering workplace inclusion to the benefit of all - Air Liquide,"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvdGFsZW50cy9oYW5kaXZhaXJzaXR5LWZvc3RlcmluZy13b3JrcGxhY2UtaW5jbHVzaW9uLWJlbmVmaXQtYWxs0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By bringing together the words ‘handicap’, ‘diversity’, and ‘Air Liquide’ to create something new, the name of the HandivAirsity initiative embodies its aim. An essential part of inclusion and diversity (I&D) at Air Liquide is integrating people with disabilities into work at all levels and to the benefit of all parties. Yes, all parties, because inclusive workplaces are not just good for those living with disabilities, but for all members of staff – and for the Group as a whole.

Aiming for win-wins, not just compliance

Launched in France and then expanded to cover all Air Liquide entities across Europe in 2017, HandivAirsity is an ambitious initiative centered around two key objectives: hiring more candidates with disabilities and helping those with disabilities in the workplace. ""Originally,"" explains Sylvie Lazure, Mission Handicap Manager at Air Liquide, ""HandivAirsity was set up in France in our effort to increase inclusion as a responsible corporate actor ."" Additionally, the French state sets a target of 6% disabled members of staff and Air Liquide has joined many major French companies, in November 2021, in signing the country’s Manifeste Inclusion, a charter of ten axes. As all European countries have regulations concerning workplace inclusion, and some such as Germany or Italy also set quotas, Air Liquide identified the need for a Europe-wide network to share ideas, new approaches and best practices.

""Yet beyond legal obligations,"" adds Sylvie Lazure, ""HandivAirsity also promotes our ethos: ‘Our differences make our performance’. Integrating disabled people into the workplace can benefit everyone – not those directly concerned."" Teams which have to rethink their organization as well as parts of their processes, for instance, benefit from innovation and increased efficiency, as well as a more inclusive, understanding environment for everyone. ""When inclusion happens, it often challenges preconceptions and leads to pragmatic solutions - some of which also prove to be more efficient."""
Air Liquide Recognition Statement From Climate Action 100+ Lead Investors - Climate Action 100+,"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsaW1hdGVhY3Rpb24xMDAub3JnL25ld3MvYWlyLWxpcXVpZGUtcmVjb2duaXRpb24tc3RhdGVtZW50LWZyb20tY2xpbWF0ZS1hY3Rpb24tMTAwLWxlYWQtaW52ZXN0b3JzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"We, as institutional investors (Nordea Asset Management, OFI Asset Management and Trusteam Finance) leading the engagement with Air Liquide as part of the Climate Action 100+ (CA100+) initiative, are pleased to see the significant steps taken by the company in the last months.

In its answers to our questions in the latest AGM[1], Air Liquide has:

Announced that its Net Zero ambition covers Scope 1, 2 and 3[2] carbon emissions and further explained where the main category of Scope 3 carbon emissions stem from. The company has also elaborated on the strategy it should undertake to embark on a carbon neutral pathway, under the IIPCC scenario (cf.

[2] “ambition to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 […] This carbon neutrality ambition must be understood as applying throughout the whole of Air Liquide’s value chain, and therefore cover not only direct Group emissions (“Scope 1”), but also indirect emissions relating to energy supplies (“Scope 2”) and the main items of indirect emissions covered by “Scope 3.” (Page 3)

“2021 emissions reported in Scope 3 category 11 “use of sold products” correspond to 9.2 MtCO2e, i.e. ~40% of Scope 3 emissions and ~15% of cumulative Scope 1+2+3 emissions comes from less then 5% of the group revenues,” (Page 3 / 2)

“Over 80% of the CO2 sold by the Group comes from sources where the CO2 is a by-product of an existing process and would therefore have been released to the atmosphere.” (Page 4)

[3] “Achieving our carbon neutrality objective in 2050 will require the use of carbon-free raw materials.” which are Carbone Free electricity and H2 by electrolysis (Page 4)

[4] “Air Liquide has nevertheless developed its climate objectives based on various studies, including those of the IPCC (specifically including the special report on 1.5°) and those of the International Energy Agency, whose Net Zero report published in May 2021 highlights similar drivers, and a similar trajectory for heavy industry, to those in our plan” (Page 1)

“Air Liquide announced its ambition to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, in order to help reach carbon neutrality on a global scale, which is the objective stated by the IPCC in order to make it possible to keep the rise in temperatures under 1.5°C at the end of the 21 st century.” (Page 3)

“According to Air Liquide’s business model, business growth requires investment in new production units. Consequently, the achievement of our decarbonization objectives will necessarily involve aligning our investment plans with this trajectory.” (Page 5)

“This management thus ensures that all new investments are in line with the Group’s carbon neutrality trajectory and in line with the shorter-term objectives, and it excludes any projects that are not in line with the trajectory.” (Page 5)

“Moreover, the Group’s investment projects are evaluated and selected considering their contribution to the Group CO2 emissions trajectory, the objective being carbon neutrality in 2050 in line with the Paris Agreements.” (Page 7)

[5] “all lobbying activities are in line with the Group’s strategy which is committing to carbon neutrality.” [….] “we are carrying out for the main trade association where we are active.” (Page 5 / 6)

[6] “An increase in the price of CO2 above €100 per tonne is consistent with an acceleration of the decarbonization of assets invested in by Air Liquide for its customers. Since the cost of CO2 is contractually passed through to the customer, the customer must choose between paying the carbon tax or being supplied with decarbonized gas. Consequently, the higher the price of CO2 , the more attractive it is for the customer to accept a higher gas price, thus enabling Air Liquide to invest in a CO2 capture unit (on an existing production unit) or to invest in a new low-carbon technology gas production unit. We consider that, in the industrial phase, the price of CO2 capture on existing assets will be less than €100 per tonne. Accordingly, a very high CO2 price, in line with the Paris Agreements, does not in fact increase the risk for Group assets but, on the contrary, reduces it.” (Page 7)"

"EU grants for clean hydrogen | Shell, RWE and Air Liquide among winners from €1.8bn handout - Recharge","Wed, 13 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZWNoYXJnZW5ld3MuY29tL2VuZXJneS10cmFuc2l0aW9uL2V1LWdyYW50cy1mb3ItY2xlYW4taHlkcm9nZW4tc2hlbGwtcndlLWFuZC1haXItbGlxdWlkZS1hbW9uZy13aW5uZXJzLWZyb20tMS04Ym4taGFuZG91dC8yLTEtMTI1NzExMdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Three utility-scale clean hydrogen projects have been awarded a slice of over €1.8bn ($1.81bn) in grants as part of the second large-project funding call for the EU Innovation Fund, the European Commission said yesterday, drastically increasing their likelihood of reaching commercial operation.

Among the 17 winners are two green hydrogen projects and one waste-to-hydrogen scheme, all based in the Netherlands. No information on the size of the individual grants was available at the time of writing.

“The Innovation Fund is an important tool to scale up innovations in renewable hydrogen and other solutions for European industry,” said Frans Timmermans, executive vice president of the European Commission. “Compared to the first disbursement round, the funds available have increased by 60%, enabling us to double the number of projects supported.”

One of the two renewable H 2 projects, oil giant Shell’s 400MW Holland Hydrogen 1 plant, reached FID on the first 200MW phase last week. Powered by the 750MW Hollandse Kust Noord offshore wind farm under development in the Dutch North Sea, the company aims to bring the facility on-line by 2025, before doubling capacity by 2027. The renewable hydrogen it produces will be exported by open-access pipeline to shore, replacing some of the grey hydrogen Shell uses in its Rotterdam refinery.

The other is Air Liquide’s 200MW ELYgator project in Terneuzen, engineered to produce 15,500 tonnes of green hydrogen a year via its “flexible electrolyser dispatch” model, which will produce in line with available wind and solar electricity and prevent grid congestion. The H 2 production will be marketed to users in industry and the mobility sectors.

The third project, a waste-to-H2 scheme known as FUREC, is being developed by RWE to produce 54,000 tonnes of hydrogen a year from non-recyclable solid waste at an industrial cluster in Limburg. Green H2 will replace grey used in the chemical industry, RWE says, and will set up a hydrogen link between Dutch ports and Germany’s industrialised Ruhr area.

Also in receipt of funding is the 433MW Nordsee Two offshore wind farm project in the German North Sea, in which RWE has a 51% stake. The company and its partner in the project, Canada's Northland Power, plan to integrate 4MW of electolyser capacity into the project, for use in vessel refuelling and emergency power.

Earlier this month wind turbine giant Vestas began a trial of the ""world's first"" hydrogen-powered crew transfer vessel at the Norther Wind Farm in Belgium.

The funding comes on top of EU Innovation Fund-backed subsidies already announced by the Commission, which will support green hydrogen projects via a carbon contracts for difference (CCfD) scheme.

Hydrogen transport by pipeline is well established in the Netherlands. Last month the Dutch government announced a plan to build the world’s first national H 2 transmission network, an ambitious plan based on repurposed natural gas pipelines that may be difficult to replicate in other countries."
Air Liquide To Invest In Two Hydrogen Plants In Shanghai - Carbon Herald,"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYm9uaGVyYWxkLmNvbS9haXItbGlxdWlkZS10by1pbnZlc3QtaW4tdHdvLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLXBsYW50cy1pbi1zaGFuZ2hhaS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide’s subsidiary Shanghai Chemical Industry Park Industrial Gases (SCIPIG). will invest over €200 million in building two hydrogen production facilities and related infrastructure in Shanghai Chemical Industry Park (SCIP).

The two plants have the potential to bring great benefit to the environment as they are planned to replace current supply from a third party gasification unit based on coal. The new facilities will feature carbon capture and recycle technology and will be connected to the Park’s existing local network. SCIPIG already operates two other hydrogen plants and four air separation units at the Park.

The new plants will produce hydrogen and carbon monoxide for the supply to Covestro China and Shanghai Lianheng Isocyanate Company in the Park through more than 15-year-long contracts. The total hydrogen production capacity of the two units is approximately 70,000 Nm3/h. The plants will also feature units for carbon capture and recycling and the production of carbon monoxide at a 28,000 Nm3/h capacity.

The SCIPIG plants will go operational in several phases, which will begin by the end of 2023, and will be built by Air Liquide Engineering & Construction. Equipped with carbon recycle units, the facilities will avoid 350,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually, or as much as the electricity emissions of 1 million households in China.

Air Liquide has played an important role in the development of SCIP since 1996. The 29,4 km2 park near the Shanghai Yangshan port hosts both local and international chemical companies.

Air Liquide announced recently it will create a joint venture between Shenergy and SCIP to use the SCIPIG-produced hydrogen to supply hydrogen refueling stations on the Yangtze River Delta and support the region’s rapidly evolving hydrogen vehicles market.

“These new investments further enhance Air Liquide’s long-term collaboration with Covestro, SLIC and Shanghai Chemical Industry Park,” said François Abrial, Member of the Air Liquide Group’s Executive Committee supervising Asia Pacific. “Leveraging our expertise in hydrogen production as well as carbon capture and utilization, the project demonstrates our capacity to bring solutions for our customers which are reliable, competitive, and beneficial to the environment. A specialist in the decarbonization of the industry, Air Liquide is proud, with this project, to support Shanghai’s ambitious climate plan.”

Air Liquide sales beat forecasts on higher prices - Nasdaq,"Thu, 28 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiJ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hc2RhcS5jb20vZnIvbm9kZS8xNTIwMTA0NtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Adds more details

July 28 (Reuters) - French industrial gases group Air Liquide AIRP.PA on Thursday beat expectations for half-year sales, helped by its core Gas & Services division as well as through higher pricing.

The company also confirmed its 2022 outlook.

The supplier of gases such as oxygen and hydrogen to factories and hospitals reported half-year sales of 14.2 billion euros ($14.49 billion), slightly ahead of the 14.09 billion euro average analyst forecast in a company-provided consensus.

Natural gas prices have soared as a consequence of lower supplies from Russia to Europe. Air Liquide, which uses natural gas at its production units, said it has been able to tackle inflation through higher pricing, particularly in its Industrial Merchant and Electronics divisions.

""In Industrial Merchant ... dynamic price management allowed the group to transfer the increase in costs, while in Large Industries, the increase in energy prices is contractually passed on to customers,"" Chief Executive François Jackow said in a statement.

Gas & Services, responsible for 96% of Air Liquide's sales, had sales growth in all its geographies, enjoying strong growth particularly in Asia, the company said.

Air Liquide confirmed its outlook for the year, namely an increase in operating margin as well as recurring net profit growth at constant exchange rates.

ISTC leads extensive portfolio of carbon capture projects - University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Fri, 08 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vYmxvZ3MuaWxsaW5vaXMuZWR1L3ZpZXcvNzQ0Ny82MDM5Mjg5ODDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ISTC engineer Stephanie Brownstein gestures toward equipment for the biphasic solvent carbon capture project at Abbott Power Plant while speaking to visitors from the Department of Energy and Doosan Corporation. Photo by Travis Tate, U of I Facilities & Services.

Visitors from the U.S. Department of Energy National Energy Technology Laboratory (DOE-NETL) recently toured multiple carbon capture projects led by the Illinois Sustainable Technology Center (ISTC).

Because the unique geology of Illinois provides extensive potential to store carbon dioxide deep underground, the state is also an ideal location to develop, demonstrate, and deploy technologies to capture CO 2 from point sources, remove CO 2 from the ambient air, and beneficially use CO 2 . ISTC scientists and engineers lead a number of carbon capture, removal, and use projects backed by funding from the Department of Energy.

Abbott Power Plant

The University’s Abbott Power Plant , a cogeneration facility that simultaneously produces both steam and electricity to meet 70-75% of the Urbana campus’s energy needs, is a partner on two ISTC-led carbon capture projects.

ISTC led a project, supported by $3.4 million from DOE-NETL, to evaluate an innovative biphasic solvent system for its efficiency and effectiveness in absorbing CO₂ from flue gas at Abbott. The system was designed based on the testing results at the laboratory scale under a previous DOE cooperative agreement. Read more about the biphasic solvent system.

A second project is based on a mixed-salt carbon capture technology developed by SRI International. This technology is being tested at engineering scale at Abbott in a 0.5 megawatt electric (MWe) equivalent pilot campaign. This project is supported by a grant of more than $18 million from DOE-NETL. Read more about the mixed-salt capture technology.

City Water, Light & Power

ISTC leads the large-scale pilot testing of a Linde-BASF CO 2 solvent-based carbon capture technology at City Water, Light & Power (CWLP) in Springfield, Illinois. When the 10-megawatt capture system is built and begins to process 5 percent of the Dallman Unit 4 flue gas, it will capture more than 90 percent of those CO 2 emissions. DOE has provided $47 million for this build-operate project, and the State of Illinois has pledged an additional $20 million. Read more about the large pilot project at CWLP.

A second project led by ISTC and backed by $25 million from DOE aims to design a next-generation power plant at CWLP that both reduces emissions and captures and uses carbon dioxide. The design combines a 270-megawatt ultra-supercritical coal boiler, an 87-megawatt natural gas combustion turbine generator, a 50-megawatt energy storage subsystem, and a post-combustion carbon capture subsystem. Read more about the next-generation power plant project.

ISTC is investigating the use of CO 2 captured from CWLP, as well as nutrients from wastewater treatment plants to grow algae. The cultivated high-protein Spirulina can be used in animal feeds. This engineering-scale algae project is supported by $2.5 million from DOE. Read more about the algae project.

Prairie State Generating Company

The tour included ISTC carbon capture projects at Abbott Power Plant at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; City Water, LIght & Power in Springfield, Prairie State Generating Company in Marissa, Illinois; and the Ste. Genevieve Cement Plant in Missouri. Delete Edit embedded media in the Files Tab and re-insert as needed. align image left align image center align image right

ISTC leads a front-end engineering design (FEED) study to retrofit the Prairie State Generating Company (PSGC) in Marissa, Illinois, with a solvent-based post-combustion carbon capture technology from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. At 816 megawatts, this is the largest carbon capture FEED study in the world, with a system projected to be capable of capturing 8.5 million tonnes of CO 2 each year. Read more about the FEED study at Prairie State Generating Company.

Ste. Genevieve Cement Plant

Cement is a ubiquitous construction material, and its production produces tonnes of carbon dioxide each year. While scientists are working on alternative cements and lower-carbon production processes, it is likely that capturing and either using or storing emissions from cement production will be necessary to meet carbon reduction targets.

ISTC leads a front-end engineering and design (FEED) study for a commercial-scale carbon capture retrofit of Holcim’s Ste. Genevieve Cement Plant in Bloomsdale, Missouri. The project focuses on Air Liquide’s CrycocapTM FG system for carbon capture and is backed by $4 million from DOE-NETL. Read more about the Ste. Genevieve carbon capture project.

Carbon removal through direct air capture

Projects to remove carbon dioxide from ambient air, called direct air capture (DAC), were not included in the recent tour but are a growing part of ISTC's carbon management portfolio.

ISTC leads a project, backed by a grant of nearly $2.5 million from DOE-NETL, to develop preliminary designs and determine feasibility for the first commercial-scale direct air capture and storage system (DAC+S) for CO 2 removal in the United States. This 18-month project will explore the possibility of pulling 100,000 tonnes of CO 2 from the air annually, using technology from the Swiss company Climeworks, which has built and operated several DAC plants in various climates across Europe. The ISTC-led team will test the large-scale DAC systems at three sites across the U.S. in order to assess how different climate conditions impact the process. Read more about the DAC+S project.

ISTC and Climeworks also are collaborating on a $2.5 million FEED study of a DAC system to capture CO 2 for underground storage. The California host site, a geothermal plant, will provide thermal energy to drive the DAC process; the site also is close to a proposed geological storage facility in the Joaquin Basin.

ISTC also leads a FEED study of direct air capture technology developed by CarbonCapture Inc. at U. S. Steel’s Gary Works Plant in Gary, Indiana. This project incorporates use of the captured carbon dioxide at a nearby Ozinga ready mix concrete plant. Injecting the CO 2 into the concrete as it is being mixed causes the CO 2 to mineralize, locking it in the concrete and preventing it from returning to the atmosphere. By using the U. S. Steel plant’s waste heat, energy needs can be reduced. Read more about the carbon capture and use FEED study at U. S. Steel's Gary Works Plant.

Finally, ISTC is a partner on a project that is exploring the benefits of constructing DAC technology at Constellation Energy’s Byron nuclear energy plant in Northern Illinois. Although nuclear plants do not produce carbon emissions, the plant can provide energy to power the DAC system, which could capture 250,000 tons of CO 2 each year.

North Las Vegas’ Apex lands big industrial project - Las Vegas Review-Journal,"Fri, 29 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL25vcnRoLWxhcy12ZWdhcy1hcGV4LWxhbmRzLWJpZy1pbmR1c3RyaWFsLXByb2plY3QtMjYxNDkyOC_SAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9ub3J0aC1sYXMtdmVnYXMtYXBleC1sYW5kcy1iaWctaW5kdXN0cmlhbC1wcm9qZWN0LTI2MTQ5MjgvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NorthPoint Development broke ground last week on an industrial complex that is expected to span more than 2 million square feet.

Apex Industrial Park, after seeing little development for years, has landed another big project.

NorthPoint Development broke ground last week on a two-building industrial complex in Apex. The project, North Vegas Logistics Center, is expected to span more than 2 million square feet on almost 130 acres.

The developer aims to substantially complete both buildings by late second quarter or early third quarter next year, said Joel Schrenk, regional vice president for NorthPoint’s Western U.S. operations.

Schrenk said that Southern Nevada has emerged as a regional distribution hub for a number of companies and that the shift to online shopping has fueled big demand for warehouse space.

People now expect rapid delivery when buying products online, and the amount of distribution space needed for that is “astounding,” he said.

He also noted that available land has been depleted in the Las Vegas Motor Speedway area, an especially popular spot for warehouse construction lately, and that Apex, which has plenty of open desert, is the next logical stop.

“It’s where the market’s going,” Schrenk said.

Apex, off Interstate 15 at U.S. Highway 93 in North Las Vegas, has been around for decades and offers thousands of acres for potential projects. It plodded along for years with little development amid a dearth of infrastructure.

However, utility service has been expanding to Apex, and as developers keep packing Southern Nevada with more warehouses, investors have been buying land and pushing ahead with construction plans in the remote business park some 20 miles northeast of the Strip.

French energy giant Air Liquide held a ribbon-cutting ceremony in May for a $250 million liquid hydrogen plant in Apex, and Reno developer Dermody Properties broke ground late last year on a 664,300-square-foot distribution facility nearby.

Aluminum beverage can maker Ball Corp. also unveiled plans last year to build a plant in Apex; developer VanTrust Real Estate bought roughly 350 acres last year with plans for a 4.5 million-square-foot industrial park; and grocery chain Smith’s purchased nearly 100 acres last year.

Those sites are all near each other at the southern edge of Apex.

The surge of activity follows the launch of a water-pipeline project from the city of North Las Vegas and Western States Contracting CEO Weston Adams, who has extensive land holdings in Apex.

When the city announced the 12-mile surface pipeline’s groundbreaking ceremony in summer 2018, its news release highlighted the need for basic utilities, saying: “Decades-old problem solved: Water coming to North Las Vegas’ Apex Industrial Park.”

The pipeline was designed to serve the southern area of Apex.

ExxonMobil Baytown leaders reinforce plans for first blue hydrogen plant - BIC Magazine,"Thu, 14 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaWNtYWdhemluZS5jb20vcHJvamVjdHMtZXhwYW5zaW9ucy9kb3duc3RyZWFtL2V4eG9ubW9iaWwtYmF5dG93bi1sZWFkZXJzLXJlaW5mb3JjZS1wbGFucy1mb3ItZmlyc3QtYmx1ZS1oeWRyb2dlbi1wbGFudC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"During an onsite tour, ExxonMobil leaders emphasized plans to build a hydrogen production plant and carbon capture and storage (CCS) project at its integrated refining and petrochemicals site in Baytown, Texas.

The CCS project associated with the hydrogen production would be one of the world’s largest, with capacity to store up to 10 million metric tons of CO 2 per year, according to the ExxonMobil team.

Expand Jana Stafford with BIC Magazine meets ExxonMobil's new Low Carbon Solutions President Dan Ammann during a tour of the future site of Exxon's hydrogen production plant and CCS project at the company's Baytown facility.

“The CCS project would mark our initial contribution to the broader, cross-industry effort in the Houston region to capture 50 million metric tons of CO 2 per year by 2030 and 100 million metric tons of CO 2 per year by 2040,” said Dan Ammann, president, ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions.

The plant would be ExxonMobil’s first blue hydrogen plant in the world, and would produce up to 1 billion cubic feet of hydrogen daily.

“It’s an incredibly exciting project,” Ammann said. “It’s an early and really important step for carbon capture.”

The Baytown location is close to CO 2 storage sites along the Gulf Coast, providing ExxonMobil with a network of potential customers along the Houston Ship Channel.

“What we’re able to do here, with a site like this, is because we have a built-in use case and built-in customer,” Ammann explained. “It gives us that starting point to make the major investment that we can take externally, both on the hydrogen side and on the carbon capture and storage side. As we build the infrastructure necessary to get this going, it allows us to create that foundation.”

According to Ammann, half of the hydrogen produced by the site will go to customers around the area to support local decarbonization efforts.

ExxonMobil is a member of the Houston Energy Transition Initiative (HETI), a group of companies committed to advancing CCS efforts in the Houston area.

“We are part of 14 different companies that have come together to advocate specifically for carbon capture and storage,” said Ed Graham, vice president, Ventures, ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions.

Companies in the initiative include ExxonMobil, Air Liquide, BASF, Shell, Calpine, Chevron, Dow, INEOS, Linde, LyondellBasell, Marathon Petroleum, NRG Energy, Phillips 66 and Valero. Together, these companies and others in the region could capture and safely store up to 50 million metric tons of CO2 per year by 2030 and about 100 million metric tons per year by 2040, helping to significantly reduce emissions in the Houston region, according to an ExxonMobil press release.

Industry support for large-scale carbon capture and storage continues to gain momentum in Houston, as well as support from Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, the Harris County Commissioners’ Court, the Greater Houston Partnership and the Center for Houston’s Future.

“Collective efforts could capture and store approximately 50 million metric tons of CO2 per year by 2030 and 100 million by 2040, significantly reducing CO 2 emissions from one of the United States’ largest industrial areas,” stated the release.

ExxonMobil has progressed to site selection for the planned hydrogen plant at Baytown, but it’s too early to discuss permitting, project cost or job creation, according to ExxonMobil spokesman Todd Spitler. A final investment decision is expected in the next two to three years, subject to supportive government policy, necessary regulatory permits and market conditions."
Quebec invests $55M in Flying Whales’ cargo airship project - Skies Magazine,"Wed, 06 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZXNtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvcXVlYmVjLWludmVzdHMtNTUtbWlsbGlvbi1mbHlpbmctd2hhbGVzLWNhcmdvLWFpcnNoaXAtcHJvamVjdC_SAVxodHRwczovL3NraWVzbWFnLmNvbS9uZXdzL3F1ZWJlYy1pbnZlc3RzLTU1LW1pbGxpb24tZmx5aW5nLXdoYWxlcy1jYXJnby1haXJzaGlwLXByb2plY3QvP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Brian Dunn | July 6, 2022 Brian Dunn |

Quebec’s ambitious plan to build cargo airships is moving ahead with an investment of C$55 million from the province’s Investissement Québec.

As previously reported, the project by French company Flying Whales was first announced in November 2019, when the Quebec government said it was investing $30 million and possibly more in the venture. But the project was blocked by Ottawa due to Chinese involvement, which is no longer the case as the Chinese 24.9 percent stake has been purchased by the company’s French shareholders.

The $55 million is split between the share capital of Flying Whales and its subsidiary, Les Dirigeables Flying Whales Québec.

“These contributions are aimed at the development and certification of airships intended for the transport of heavy and oversized loads in territories that are difficult to access by land,” according to the Quebec government.

The Flying Whales group has just concluded a third round of financing worth 122 million euros. Besides Quebec, the French State — through the French Tech Souveraineté — and the Principality of Monaco are joining the project. Two current shareholders, ALIAD (Air Liquide Venture Capital) and Groupe ADP, are also putting money into the venture.

“Flying Whales is taking another step in its growth, where Quebec expertise will allow the development of a new generation of aircraft,” said Quebec Economic Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon in a statement.

Quebec wants to see Flying Whales carry out a research and development component this year. Eventually, an aircraft production plant would follow. The first certification and commercial flights are planned for 2025-2026. “Major components will be developed in Quebec, such as the hybrid-electric propulsion system, avionics, and the crew cabin,” said the government, which expects roughly 100 jobs would be created within three years.

“It is here (in Quebec) that we will produce and operate the LCA60T [cargo airship] solution for the American continent,” said Sébastien Bougon, founder and CEO of Flying Whales.

Founded in 2012, Flying Whales plans to create cargo airships (LCA60T) for transporting oversized loads up to 60 tons. The aircraft will first be equipped with hybrid propulsion, then fully electric. The lift will be generated by helium."
C&EN's Global Top 50 chemical firms for 2022 - Chemical & Engineering News,"Sun, 24 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vY2VuLmFjcy5vcmcvYnVzaW5lc3MvZmluYW5jZS9DRU5zLUdsb2JhbC1Ub3AtNTAtMjAyMi8xMDAvaTI20gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The world’s chemical industry didn’t just grow in 2021, it positively swelled.

According to C&EN’s latest Global Top 50 survey, the world’s 50 largest chemical companies, in aggregate, posted sales of $1.1 trillion in 2021, the fiscal year that forms the basis of the ranking. That’s a 38% increase over the combined total for the same 50 firms in 2020.

Profits more than kept up. Chemical operating income for the 41 firms that break out such numbers jumped 148% in 2021, hitting $127 billion.

There are two big reasons for the spike in chemical sales and earnings in 2021. First, the world’s economy sagged in 2020 on account of the COVID-19 pandemic. This downturn hit the chemical industry, albeit not as severely as it did industries like aerospace and automotive. The 50 firms that appeared a year ago in C&EN’s survey posted a 7% decline in sales. And they posted earnings declines for the second year in a row. With the world economy recovering in 2021, it stands to reason that chemical sales recovered as well.

Also related to the spike is inflation, the likes of which some countries around the world haven’t seen in decades. According to the Energy Information Administration, the US benchmark oil price rose from $47.07 per barrel in December 2020 to $71.69 a year later.

The chemical industry, most of which relies on oil as a raw material, responded by raising prices in kind. According to LyondellBasell Industries, US and European ethylene prices increased by 35% and 60%, respectively, in 2021, while polyethylene prices rose about 45%. Prices for ammonia more than doubled.

Thus, the healthiest sales increases seen in the Global Top 50 came from petrochemical companies. Sabic, Formosa Plastics, PetroChina, LyondellBasell Industries, and ExxonMobil Chemical all clocked in with sales increases of 40% or more. Also riding the crest of the commodity price wave are fertilizer makers such as Yara, Nutrien, and Mosaic, which posted astounding increases in sales.

A few companies in the 2021 ranking fell off in 2022 because they didn’t have enough sales to make the cut. These are the US petrochemical maker Westlake, the US agricultural chemical producer Corteva Agriscience, and the Japanese chemical makers Tosoh and DIC.

Joining the ranking for the first time is EuroChem Group, one of the fertilizer makers that got a lift from higher commodity prices. It debuts at number 44. Thailand’s PTT Global Chemical returns at 46 after a 1-year hiatus.

Two Chinese newcomers make the ranking: TongKun Group at 48 and Hengyi Petrochemical at 50. Both are polyester producers that make their own raw materials. Hengyi also has a large, integrated nylon 6 business. Both companies join similar Chinese firms, like Hengli Petrochemical and Rongsheng Petrochemical. All these companies have been building massive complexes for aromatics and derivatives, in many cases swamping entire segments of the chemical industry—such as purified terephthalic acid—with new capacity that is well beyond the scale of players outside China.

BASF

2021 chemical sales: $93.0 billion

For the third consecutive year, BASF heads the Global Top 50. Because it has a home base in Germany, the company was strongly impacted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. BASF pledged in April to wind down operations in Russia and Belarus, which represent about 1% of its sales. The company says it will continue supplying agrochemicals to these countries to avoid disrupting the world’s delicate food supply chain. BASF has also been affected by the severe increase in European natural gas prices that the war has exacerbated. In March, BASF chairman Martin Brudermüller told a Houston audience at the IHS Markit World Petrochemical Conference that “European industry really has to rethink” its strategy, given its dependence on natural gas from Russia. The war has also affected the company’s Wintershall Dea energy joint venture, which has extensive operations in Russia. During the first quarter, BASF took a $1.2 billion write-off related to the cancellation of Nord Stream 2, a natural gas pipeline between Germany and Russia that Wintershall helped finance. BASF is also anticipating the coming energy transition. The company is carving out its emission catalyst business, which it acquired with its 2006 purchase of Engelhard. The move is a response to the dim outlook for internal combustion engine vehicles and could be a prelude to a sale. BASF has simultaneously been trying to grow as a producer of materials for electric vehicle batteries and aims to spend $5 billion on production capacity outside Europe.

Sinopec

2021 chemical sales: $65.8 billion

Once again, the blue-chip Chinese firm Sinopec is the second-largest chemical company in the world. Sinopec is working on an enormous lineup of capital expansions in China. Last year in Zhenhai, it started up an ethylene cracker project and began work on a propane dehydrogenation plant that it hopes to finish in 2024. The firm is building a cracker and derivatives project in Tianjin that it expects to complete next year and is bringing another one to completion in Hainan this year. Sinopec is also constructing a massive purified terephthalic acid complex in Yizheng. Like many energy and chemical firms, Sinopec has gotten into the act of carbon abatement. In Zibo earlier this year, it started up a carbon-capture-and-storage project that will handle 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually.

Dow

2021 chemical sales: $55.0 billion

In 2020, Dow revealed its aspiration to reach carbon emission neutrality by 2050, and at an investor event in October, it detailed its plans to get there. The company aims to spend $1 billion per year, about a third of its capital budget, to decarbonize its petrochemical sites around the world one by one. Topping that list is Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, where in an industry first, the company will build a carbon-neutral ethylene cracker. An autothermal reformer will process the cracker’s off-gases to generate hydrogen that will be burned in the cracker’s furnaces instead of natural gas. Dow will capture the resulting carbon dioxide and inject it into Alberta’s CO 2 pipeline for sequestration. Dow’s sustainability push extends beyond greenhouse gases and into plastic waste. At the October event, for example, the company said it would collaborate with Fuenix Ecogy to build a waste plastics pyrolysis plant in the Netherlands.

Sabic

2021 chemical sales: $43.2 billion

The Saudi giant Sabic has a large presence in Europe owing to its acquisition of petrochemical businesses from DSM and Huntsman more than a decade ago. And while the company gained a North American engineering polymer business in 2007 with the purchase of GE Plastics, a US toehold in petrochemicals has been more elusive. Sabic finally accomplished this long-term objective in January when its $10 billion joint venture with ExxonMobil Chemical, Gulf Coast Growth Ventures, started up near Corpus Christi, Texas. The venture produces ethylene and the derivatives polyethylene and ethylene glycol. The project is noteworthy because of how quickly it was erected: in just over 2 years. Some recent US petrochemical projects have experienced delays longer than that.

Formosa Plastics

2021 chemical sales: $43.2 billion

Formosa Plastics’ proposed $9.4 billion petrochemical complex in St. James Parish, Louisiana, suffered a major setback last year when the US Army Corps of Engineers ordered a full environmental review. That process could take longer than 2 years, according to local activists. The massive project, which would include an ethylene cracker, polyethylene plants, and other facilities, was originally unveiled in 2015. While the complex would be an important diversification move for the Taiwan-based company, S&P Global Ratings noted in a report in October that Formosa’s management could be reaching the end of its patience for delays and local opposition. “We see diminishing probability that the planned mega project in Louisiana will go ahead, given the changing political atmosphere in the U.S.,” the credit rating agency wrote.

Ineos

2021 chemical sales: $39.9 billion

Since its inception in the 1990s, Ineos has expanded by acquiring established divisions of large chemical companies. Most recently, in early 2021, it bought BP’s aromatics business, a major producer of purified terephthalic acid, for $5 billion. Since then, Ineos has been focusing on sustainability. In September, it announced a $1.3 billion plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 60% at its Grangemouth, Scotland, petrochemical complex by 2030. It will do so by capturing the greenhouse gas and sending it to the proposed Acorn CO 2 system, which aims to inject it under the North Sea. In October, Ineos said it plans to spend $2.3 billion on green hydrogen projects. It will construct a 20 MW electrolyzer, powered by alternative energy, in Rafnes, Norway. And in Cologne, Germany, Ineos wants to build a 100 MW electrolyzer that will make hydrogen for green ammonia. Separately, Ineos is installing a unit in Cologne to extract acetonitrile made during acrylonitrile production. Acetonitrile is a solvent used in butadiene extraction and in high-performance liquid chromatography. Its use is acutely growing as a solvent in the production of oligonucleotides for RNA vaccines.

PetroChina

2021 chemical sales: $39.7 billion

PetroChina heaped on the growth in 2021, expanding by 42% from 2020 as China’s economy recovered from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. New projects in China will only further the company’s expansion. This year, it is due to complete the $10 billion Guangdong Petrochemical project. The massive effort includes a refinery, an aromatics unit, and an ethylene cracker. PetroChina has also finished work on an ethylene project in Tarim that will use domestically produced ethane as its feedstock. In Jieyang, an enormous $1 billion acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene plant with 600,000 metric tons per year of capacity is in the works.

LyondellBasell Industries

2021 chemical sales: $39.0 billion

Some chemical companies have been ditching commodities to focus on specialties. LyondellBasell Industries is exiting refining so it can better home in on commodities. In April, the company said it would shutter its 100-year-old Houston refinery by the end of 2023. The refinery, part of LyondellBasell Industries since it spun off from Atlantic Richfield in 1989, has long been an issue for the company. It was a joint venture with the Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA for more than a decade before Lyondell bought out its partner for $2.1 billion in 2006. Company officials say they may repurpose the property for sustainability projects such as a plastics pyrolysis plant. Meanwhile, LyondellBasell has been steadily growing its commodity chemical business. It bought 50% stakes in ethylene complexes in the US and China. And according to newly surfaced government documents, it is considering building a high-density polyethylene plant in Corpus Christi, Texas.

9

LG Chem

2021 chemical sales: $37.3 billion

LG Chem has been laying down big money on sustainable polymer and battery material projects. Last August, the company announced plans to invest $2.3 billion through 2028 on sustainable material facilities in Seosan, South Korea. One of these units will make the compostable polymer poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate). With the agricultural giant ADM, LG aims to establish lactic acid and polylactic acid capacity in the US. And with the South Korean oil company GS Caltex, LG is planning large-scale fermentation of the acrylic acid raw material 3-hydroxypropionic acid. In battery materials, LG broke ground in January on a $420 million plant in Gumi, South Korea, that will make cathode materials for electric vehicle batteries. It is also spending $375 million to form a battery separator joint venture in Hungary with Japan’s Toray Industries.

10

ExxonMobil

2021 chemical sales: $36.9 billion

Over the past year, ExxonMobil has been advancing sustainability initiatives. In March, it unveiled plans to build a blue hydrogen facility at its refining and petrochemical complex in Baytown, Texas. The project would capture 10 million metric tons (t) per year of carbon dioxide generated in the hydrogen production process, reducing the site’s carbon footprint by 30%. The project would connect to a massive carbon-capture-and-storage hub in the region that ExxonMobil is spearheading. Also in Baytown, the company is building a facility that will use new chemical technology to recycle waste plastics. It hopes to process 500,000 t of plastics annually around the world by 2026 and is also considering projects in Canada, the Netherlands, and Singapore.

11

Mitsubishi Chemical Group

2021 chemical sales: $30.7 billion

Within a year of taking over the helm of Japan’s largest chemical maker, CEO Jean-Marc Gilson, a veteran of Dow Corning and Roquette, launched a major restructuring initiative. Mitsubishi Chemical Group plans to carve out its petrochemical and coal-based chemical businesses as a separate company and then exit them by the end of its 2023 fiscal year. The units, which make olefins, polyolefins, and other bulk petrochemicals, generate about 20% of the company’s sales. Mitsubishi Chemical Group wants to focus on more specialized areas, such as electronic materials and the life sciences.

12

Hengli Petrochemical

2021 chemical sales: $28.0 billion

The expansion program at this Chinese firm is a good illustration of just how massively and systematically the Chinese petrochemical industry has been growing in recent years. For example, Hengli Petrochemical plans to bring on line 5 million metric tons (t) per year of capacity for the polyester raw material purified terephthalic acid (PTA) later this year in Huizhou, China. The company is building a 450,000 t plant to make poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT), which will consume some of the PTA as a raw material. Hengli is building a 300,000 t adipic acid unit, also to help feed PBAT production. And it is working on a big polyester fiber expansion and recently opened a large ethylene cracker.

13

Linde

2021 chemical sales: $27.9 billion

Like its industrial gas rivals Air Liquide and Air Products, Linde is focused on carbon reduction. In May, the German firm and BP announced that they would collaborate on a large carbon-capture-and-storage project on the Texas Gulf Coast. The firms aim to make blue hydrogen, produced by reforming natural gas and storing the by-product carbon dioxide. Linde will distribute this hydrogen to customers via its regional pipeline network. The firms aim to store some 15 million metric tons of CO 2 annually in underground formations. In Austria, Linde is building a plant to make green hydrogen—derived from water electrolysis powered by renewable energy—for sale to the semiconductor maker Infineon Technologies. To help shore up helium supply, Linde is adding an extraction unit at a natural gas liquefaction plant in Texas. The project will increase the world’s supply of helium by more than 3%.

Air Liquide

2021 chemical sales: $27.1 billion

Late last year, the French industrial gas giant Air Liquide got into a business that is as high tech as a chemical business can get. It signed an agreement with the Canadian nuclear power operator Laurentis Energy Partners to buy helium-3, a light isotope of helium formed via the β decay of the heavy hydrogen isotope tritium. Air Liquide will market 5,000–10,000 L of the 3He annually. The isotope is needed for quantum computing, which must operate at temperatures as close to absolute zero as possible. Conventional liquid 4He cooling can get down to 1–4 K, and getting below that requires mixing in some 3He. Separately, Air Liquide is building what it calls the world’s largest biomethane plant, at a Chicago-area landfill. The industrial gas maker estimates that the collected methane could generate 380 GW h of energy annually. It is also building a methane recovery plant in Wisconsin.

15

Syngenta Group

2021 chemical sales: $24.9 billion

The Chinese conglomerate ChemChina bought the Swiss agrochemical maker Syngenta in 2017 and later pursued a merger with another big Chinese industrial giant, Sinochem. Now Syngenta Group operates under the Sinochem umbrella. As it did when it was independent, Syngenta emphasizes technology. It is collaborating with Enko Chem, a start-up that applies drug discovery methods to agricultural applications. For instance, the partners will screen molecular libraries for compounds that act against specific enzymes in pests. They hope to halve the time to bring new molecules to market—which can now take a decade. Syngenta also recently bought two biopesticides from the Welsh firm Bionema. In the deal, it acquired nematodes that kill leatherjackets and a pathogenic fungus that kills vine weevils.

16

Reliance Industries

2021 chemical sales: $22.6 billion

The Indian conglomerate has abandoned plans to put its refining and chemical operations—which it calls Oil to Chemicals—into a stand-alone business. It also walked away from negotiations with Saudi Aramco to sell a 20% stake in the business for $15 billion. Instead, Reliance Industries is undertaking what may turn out to be an even bigger change in direction. Last year, it announced an ambitious goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2035. Reliance is setting aside 2,000 hectares of land at its massive Jamnagar refinery and petrochemical complex for factories that would make photovoltaic modules, batteries, electrolyzers, and fuel cells. Along these lines, Reliance bought Faradion, a British sodium-ion battery start-up, for $135 million. It will spend another $35 million to bring the new battery chemistry to market. It also purchased the Norwegian solar cell maker REC Group for $771 million.

17

Wanhua Chemical

2021 chemical sales: $22.6 billion

The Chinese polyurethane and petrochemical maker has been rocketing up the Global Top 50 because of its prodigious growth in recent years. And 2021 was another enormous year for Wanhua Chemical—its revenues nearly doubled from 2020. Ambitious capital expansion projects have helped fuel the growth. In Yantai, China, it opened an ethylene cracker and derivatives plants and revamped methylene diphenyl diisocyanate production. In April, the company announced it would spend $3.6 billion to build a chemical complex in Penglai, China. The project, to be completed in 2024, will feature a propane dehydrogenation unit as well as downstream plants for polypropylene, propylene oxide, and other chemicals. The company also started producing cathode materials and the biodegradable polymer poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate).

18

Braskem

2021 chemical sales: $19.6 billion

It is possible that Braskem could change hands in the near future. Novonor, the Brazilian conglomerate formerly known as Odebrecht, is facing hefty fines because of a Brazilian corruption scandal. The US Department of Justice alone is demanding $2.6 billion from the company. As a consequence, Novonor has been looking to sell its 38% interest in Braskem, which includes control of more than 50% of Braskem’s common stock. Sale talks are nothing new for Braskem. The company discussed a sale to LyondellBasell Industries in 2018 and 2019, but nothing came of the negotiations. In 2020, Novonor and Braskem’s other major shareholder, the Brazilian state oil company Petrobras, planned to float Braskem shares on public markets. That plan was shelved earlier this year because of financial market volatility. And in April, the private equity firm Apollo Capital was rumored to be bidding for Novonor’s stake.

19

Sumitomo Chemical

2021 chemical sales: $19.2 billion

The Japanese chemical maker Sumitomo Chemical is undertaking a round of downsizing. It will close its caprolactam plant in Ehime, Japan, by October, ending production of the nylon 6 raw material after more than 50 years because of difficulties staying competitive against new production in China. Indeed, Chinese chemical makers have been growing prodigiously in a number of aromatic chemicals, an alarming trend for incumbents in these businesses. Sumitomo is also closing its dyestuff plant in Osaka, Japan, after more than 70 years in business. Sumitomo is finding areas with brighter futures to invest in. It is building semiconductor chemical and liquid-crystal polymer plants in Ehime and adding photoresist capacity in Japan and South Korea.

20

Shin-Etsu Chemical

2021 chemical sales: $18.9 billion

Advertisement

Shin-Etsu Chemical is coming off of a prosperous year. The company saw its revenues jump by 39% and its profits swell by 72%. A bright spot was its polyvinyl chloride business, which saw profits triple. Also, Shin-Etsu’s semiconductor material business has been trying to ship as much product as it can to help address a worldwide chip shortage. In an expansion move, Shin-Etsu will spend close to $700 million to raise output of silicone fluids, resins, and rubber at three plants in Japan.

21

Covestro

2021 chemical sales: $18.8 billion

The polyurethane specialist Covestro unveiled a plan late last year to cut up to 1,700 jobs—about 10% of its workforce—by the end of 2023. Most of the cuts will be in Germany. At the same time, the company is resuscitating a plan to build a world-scale methylene diphenyl diisocyanate plant by 2026. While the previous plan pinpointed Texas as the site of the complex, Covestro now says it may build it in either the US or China. The company is also increasing capacity for another polyurethane raw material, toluene diisocyanate, in Dormagen, Germany. And with the biotechnology firm Genomatica, Covestro plans to make biobased hexamethylenediamine, used in the manufacture of polyurethanes and nylon 6,6.

Toray Industries

2021 chemical sales: $17.9 billion

The past year has seen a number of sustainable business initiatives at Toray Industries. The company has launched nylon 5,10 fibers, made from castor oil–derived sebacic acid and corn-based pentamethylenediamine. It hopes to start selling the biobased fibers into textile markets next year. In a recycling push, Toray and the engineering firm Axens are studying a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) depolymerization plant for France. The plant would break down 80,000 metric tons per year of PET into the precursor bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate. Toray also established a joint venture for lithium-ion battery separator films in Hungary with LG Chem.

23

Evonik Industries

2021 chemical sales: $17.7 billion

Evonik Industries is yet another major chemical maker planning a portfolio transformation. The German company intends to divest its performance material businesses by the end of 2023. These commodities, such as C 4 chemicals, isononyl alcohol, and superabsorbent polymers, generate about 20% of the firm’s sales. Evonik had been considering a sale of superabsorbents—used in diapers and similar applications—since late 2020. At the same time, the firm plans to invest $3.2 billion in sustainable businesses. Separately, in June, Evonik announced it would build a $220 million plant in Lafayette, Indiana, for lipids used in messenger RNA applications like COVID-19 vaccines. The company has been supplying this burgeoning market from facilities in Germany. Evonik is also building a plant to make rhamnolipids, a class of biobased surfactants, in Slovakia.

24

Shell

2021 chemical sales: $17.0 billion

Later this year, Shell will open an ethylene and polyethylene complex in Monaca, Pennsylvania. The facility was the only one among a wave of new US ethylene crackers to be situated far from the Gulf Coast. The project took a long time. It was announced a decade ago, and construction began in 2017. It may be Shell’s last conventional ethylene project for a while. The company is collaborating with Dow to electrify the steam cracking process. The partners recently started an experimental unit in Amsterdam to test designs that could replace current natural gas–fired cracker furnaces. They want to build a large pilot plant by 2025. And at a recent conference, Shell officials said the company is running feedstocks based on biomass and plastic pyrolysis oil through its ethylene complex in Norco, Louisiana. The company intends to process 180,000 metric tons (t) of the alternative feedstocks by 2023 and to ramp up use to 600,000 t in 3–5 years.

25

DuPont

2021 chemical sales: $16.7 billion

Edward D. Breen took over as DuPont’s CEO in October 2015, and since then the company has seen relentless portfolio restructuring. After only a few months on the job, Breen announced a merger with Dow. The resulting company split into the three firms—DuPont, Dow, and Corteva Agriscience—in 2019. Breen wasn’t finished, though. Last year, DuPont merged its nutrition and biosciences business with International Flavors & Fragrances. In another big transaction, it agreed in February to sell its engineering polymer business to Celanese for $11 billion. Meanwhile, DuPont has been bulking up in electronic materials, a business that Breen had previously been on the fence about. Late last year, DuPont agreed to purchase Rogers, a firm that makes laminates for circuit boards, for $5.2 billion. In July 2021, DuPont bought Laird Performance Materials, which makes heat and electric shielding.

Yara

2021 chemical sales: $16.6 billion

Yara is planning an initial public offering for its clean ammonia business on the Oslo Stock Exchange. The unit, which had sales of $1.2 billion in 2021, operates Yara’s trade and shipping arm. It will also oversee the company’s low-carbon ammonia projects. Yara hopes the offering will raise capital that the unit needs to grow. The firm’s most ambitious clean ammonia project so far is a plan to install water electrolyzers at its plant in Porsgrunn, Norway. These units, powered by renewable electricity, will generate the hydrogen needed to make about 450,000 metric tons of green ammonia per year, to be sold as fuel for shipping and power plants. In another technological development for the company, Yara Birkeland, billed as the world’s first electric and self-propelled container ship, made its first voyage, to Oslo, Norway, in November.

Rongsheng Petrochemical

2021 chemical sales: $16.0 billion

A Rongsheng Petrochemical subsidiary, Zhejiang Petroleum & Chemical, started up the second phase of its massive refining and petrochemical complex in Zhejiang, China, in 2021. With capacity now doubled, the facility can process 40 million metric tons (t) of oil per year. The facility has a large petrochemical output: up to 6.6 million t of aromatics and 1.4 million t of ethylene per year. The expansion allowed the company to start making specialized polymers, such as acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene and polycarbonate.

28

Lotte Chemical

2021 chemical sales: $15.8 billion

The South Korean chemical maker Lotte Chemical has been beefing up its battery material business. In June, Lotte and Sasol began studying the construction of a plant for battery electrolyte solvents in the US or Germany. Lotte already makes ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate electrolyte solvents in Daesan, South Korea, and in February, it launched a $500 million program to expand output. As part of this project, Lotte is building a carbon-capture-and-liquefaction facility at the site that will provide captured carbon dioxide for electrolyte production. Separately, Lotte and the battery technology start-up Soelect are planning a joint venture for anode materials and solid electrolytes for electric vehicle batteries. The project would include a $200 million lithium-metal anode plant.

29

Mitsui Chemicals

2021 chemical sales: $14.7 billion

Mitsui Chemicals has a pair of collaborations with the Japanese technology firm Microwave Chemical. The companies developed a process to make carbon fiber by using microwaves to heat fibers during oxidation and carbonization. The partners claim the method is 50% more energy efficient than conventional ones. They are also working on a depolymerization technology for plastics. The firms are targeting automotive shredder residue, a mixture that is rich in polyethylene and polypropylene. Microwave says the process can break down these polymers into ethylene, propylene, and other chemicals. Separately, Mitsui plans to stop making the polyester raw material purified terephthalic acid at its Iwakuni-Ohtake Works in Japan in August 2023 because of competition from China.

30

Indorama Ventures

2021 chemical sales: $14.6 billion

The Thai polyester maker Indorama Ventures made another big acquisition to diversify its business earlier this year when it bought the ethoxylated surfactant maker Oxiteno from the Brazilian conglomerate Ultrapar Participações for $1.3 billion. Oxiteno has about $1 billion in annual sales. In 2020, Indorama bought Huntsman’s US-based surfactant unit, its first big move into surfactants. Indorama, already a big mechanical recycler of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), is plunging into the chemical recycling of plastics. It plans to build a plant in Longlaville, France, that will depolymerize PET using an enzymatic process from the start-up Carbios. The facility will be close to an Indorama PET plant.

31

Chevron Phillips Chemical

2021 chemical sales: $14.1 billion

Chevron Phillips Chemical is making a big push into sustainable plastics. The company recently recorded its first commercial sales of Marlex Anew circular polyethylene, made from pyrolysis oil derived from waste plastics. It aims to sell about 450,000 metric tons per year of the material by 2030. It has also invested in two firms that chemically recycle plastics, Nexus Circular and Mura Technology. Atlanta-based Nexus already supplies pyrolysis oil to Chevron Phillips. Mura is a British firm developing a supercritical steam based process to treat postconsumer plastics. Separately, Chevron Phillips recently announced it would double capacity for poly(α-olefins), which are used in lubricants, at its plant in Belgium.

32

Umicore

2021 chemical sales: $13.6 billion

The Belgian catalyst maker Umicore has ambitious goals to help the mass adoption of electric vehicles by solving that sector’s knotty problem of conserving precious raw materials. Earlier this year, Umicore announced that it would build what it calls the world’s largest battery recycling facility. It plans to build it, at a European location, by 2026. The facility will process 150,000 metric tons per year of battery materials, 15 times the amount at its current recycling facilities. Long term, Umicore aims to build a similar unit in North America. Separately, the company is providing lithium-battery recycling technology to the French battery maker Automotive Cells.

33

Solvay

2021 chemical sales: $13.5 billion

Solvay, one of Europe’s oldest chemical companies, plans to split in two. The larger of the two resulting firms would house its specialty polymers, aerospace composites, consumer ingredients, and aroma chemical businesses and have $6.6 billion in annual sales. The other would have $4.5 billion in sales and make commodity chemicals such as soda ash and peroxides. The move builds on a company plan announced in 2021 to carve out and possibly sell its soda ash business. The bigger split-up scheme got pushback from financial analysts, who questioned the advantages of combining businesses as varied as aerospace materials and consumer product ingredients. Solvay executives responded that specialty chemical businesses bear similarities, such as their appetite for capital allocation.

34

Bayer

2021 chemical sales: $12.7 billion

To limit liability from litigation, Bayer said last year that it would stop using glyphosate in its residential Roundup herbicide products in 2023. The company has reached a $10 billion settlement with thousands of plaintiffs who claim glyphosate contributed to their non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. But more suits, not subject to the settlement, remain, and more could be filed. In May, Bayer caught a break when the a European Union panel ruled that glyphosate does not pose a cancer risk. However, in the US, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to reevaluate glyphosate. It found that a previous EPA review exonerating the chemical didn’t follow the agency’s own guidelines for evaluating cancer risk.

35

Mosaic

2021 chemical sales: $12.4 billion

Potash and phosphate prices have been high, and so have profits at the leading US fertilizer producer: Mosaic enjoyed a 22% operating profit margin in 2021. The company aims to increase potash production by 2 million metric tons per year this year versus 2020 levels. It has reopened its Colonsay, Saskatchewan, plant, which had been idle for 2 years because of poor market conditions. Additionally, Mosaic has started up a new potash mine shaft in Esterhazy, Saskatchewan, while closing two older shafts at that location.

36

Nutrien

2021 chemical sales: $11.6 billion

Nutrien is giving serious backing to low-carbon ammonia. The fertilizer company is contemplating spending $2 billion to build what it says would be the world’s largest clean ammonia plant. The unit, in Geismar, Louisiana, would make up to 1.2 million metric tons per year of ammonia from natural gas and capture 90% of the production’s carbon dioxide emissions, which it would sequester underground. Nutrien already captures CO 2 at plants in Louisiana and Alberta for use in enhanced oil recovery. Separately, in the face of tight potash supplies, due in part to the war in Ukraine, Nutrien aims to increase potash production 40% by 2025.

37

Arkema

2021 chemical sales: $11.3 billion

Over the past year, Arkema has placed a lot of emphasis on one of its core businesses, adhesives, as well as on an emerging business, battery materials. The French specialty chemical maker bought Ashland’s adhesives business in February for $1.65 billion. The business has $360 million in annual sales of water-based polyurethane wood glues and acrylic, pressure-sensitive adhesives for packaging labels and other applications. In 2015, Arkema bought the adhesives maker Bostik from Total for $2.2 billion. With Nippon Shokubai, Arkema is studying the feasibility of producing lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide electrolyte salts, used in next-generation batteries, in France. Arkema’s goal is to have sales to the battery market of at least $1 billion per year by 2030. To that end, it is also expanding capacity for poly(vinylidene fluoride) in Pierre-Bénite, France. The polymer is used as a binder and separator material in lithium-ion batteries.

38

Asahi Kasei

2021 chemical sales: $10.9 billion

Asahi Kasei has been making a push into biobased chemicals. It plans to make the building-block chemical acrylonitrile from biomass-derived propylene at its Tongsuh Petrochemical subsidiary in South Korea. It will use a mass-balance approach, in which biomass fed into a conventional petrochemical plant is credited to a share of products that are made. And at a conference in Washington, DC, in March, company officials said Asahi would commercialize nylon 6,6 made with biobased hexamethylenediamine from Genomatica. Meanwhile, the Japanese company is exiting one of its old-line operations. In August, the company said it was leaving the clear styrene block copolymer business by 2023 because of deteriorating profitability.

39

DSM

2021 chemical sales: $10.9 billion

All the elements are moving into place to complete DSM’s transformation from a diversified chemical maker into a firm that focuses on nutrition and health ingredients. In May, DSM announced it would merge with the Swiss flavor and fragrance company Firmenich to create a company with $43 billion in market value. At the same time, DSM is jettisoning its remaining conventional chemical businesses. The day it unveiled the Firmenich merger, DSM disclosed plans to sell its engineering polymer business to a joint venture between the German chemical maker Lanxess and the private equity firm Advent International for $4.1 billion. The business makes workhorse engineering polymers like nylon 6 and 6,6. It also has a franchise in higher-end nylons like 4,6 and 4,10. In April, DSM agreed to sell its Dyneema ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene business to Avient.

39

Hanwha Solutions

2021 chemical sales: $10.9 billion

In June, Hanwha Solutions detailed plans to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Some 70% of the carbon reduction at the South Korean chemical and solar material maker will come from using renewable energy. Replacing fossil fuels in its manufacturing processes with hydrogen will yield another 15%. The balance of cuts will come from better efficiency and carbon capture. The company is also making investments in sustainability. It helped lead a $21 million venture capital investment in Novoloop, a California-based start-up that is developing a technology to convert postconsumer polyethylene into thermoplastic polyurethanes and other chemicals.

41

Eastman Chemical

2021 chemical sales: $10.5 billion

Eastman Chemical is taking another swing at making acetylated wood. It attempted to build a business in the moisture-resistant lumber, made by treating wood with acetic anhydride, about a decade ago but ran into trouble ramping it up. Now Eastman and the acetylated wood producer Accsys Technologies plan to build an acetylated wood plant at Eastman’s Kingsport, Tennessee, complex. The plant will cost $136 million and be completed in 2024. Eastman is also accelerating the rollout of its polyethylene terephthalate depolymerization process. Earlier this year, the company unveiled plans to build a plant using the methanolysis technology in France. It will be 45% bigger than one it aims to complete in Kingsport, Tennessee, by the end of this year. Eastman plans to use dimethyl terephthalate from the plant to make its own specialty polyesters.

42

Johnson Matthey

2021 chemical sales: $10.4 billion

Johnson Matthey (JM) is trying to find its footing. The British firm makes precious-metal catalysts for catalytic converters and is thus heavily reliant on internal combustion automotive engines, which face a bleak long-term outlook. The company has also been exiting noncore businesses. In June, it closed a deal to sell its pharmaceutical chemical business to the private equity firm Altaris Capital Partners for $430 million. The firm is retaining a 30% stake in the business, which generates more than $300 million in sales annually. Additionally, JM is selling its European battery material operations to Australia’s EV Metals Group and a battery material plant in Canada to Nano One Materials. But a possibility remains that JM itself will change hands. In April, US industrial firm Standard Industries revealed purchased a 5% stake in the company. Machinations like this often foretell a takeover. Standard bought another catalyst firm, W. R. Grace, in 2021.

43

Air Products

2021 chemical sales: $10.3 billion

Air Products’ aspirations in sustainable hydrogen get more ambitious each year. In October, the company announced plans for what it says will be the world’s largest blue hydrogen complex—a $4.5 billion plant slated to open in Ascension Parish, Louisiana, in 2026. Some of the hydrogen will be sold to regional industrial customers, while some will be used to make ammonia for the fuel market. The company is building its own carbon-capture-and-storage infrastructure that will take in the carbon dioxide from the natural gas–based hydrogen production. It has secured sites from the state of Louisiana where it would be able to store 5 million metric tons per year of CO 2 1.6 km underground. In the Middle East, Air Products, the Saudi firm ACWA Power, and the Omani state energy firm OQ have agreed to build a green ammonia plant in Oman, and Air Products and ACWA plan a similar project in Saudi Arabia.

44

EuroChem Group

2021 chemical sales: $10.2 billion

The fertilizer maker EuroChem Group makes C&EN’s global ranking for the first time this year. The company is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, but originated in Russia, where it has most of its operations. EuroChem has been caught up in the war in Ukraine more than any other chemical producer in the Global Top 50. The European Union slapped sanctions on Andrey Melnichenko, EuroChem’s founder and then owner of 90% of its stock. He tried to transfer the shares to his wife, but the EU hit her with sanctions, too. EuroChem also had a deal on the table to buy Borealis’s fertilizer business for $520 million, but the Russian invasion scuttled it.

45

Borealis

2021 chemical sales: $10.2 billion

In a transaction that will allow it to focus strictly on petrochemicals and polymers, Borealis received an $870 million offer in June for its nitrogen fertilizer business from the Czech agricultural conglomerate Agrofert. The business had sales of about $1.5 billion in 2021. The deal works out nicely for Borealis, which had an earlier overture of $520 million from EuroChem Group. Borealis walked away from that deal because of the war in Ukraine and EuroChem’s Russian connections. Borealis might have missed an opportunity to be affiliated with a high-end polymer business. OMV, the Austrian refiner that owns 75% of Borealis, put in a bid to purchase DSM’s engineering polymer business. But OMV lost out to a partnership between Advent International and Lanxess.

46

PTT Global Chemical

2021 chemical sales: $9.1 billion

PTT Global Chemical rejoins the Global Top 50 after a 1-year absence. The Thai petrochemical maker made a major diversification play late last year when it purchased the German coatings resins maker Allnex for $4.8 billion from the private equity firm Advent International. Allnex has annual sales of about $2.4 billion. PTT’s backing, Allnex management hopes, will help it expand into Asia. In the US, PTT has had a large petrochemical complex on the drawing board since 2015. But its air permits from the state of Ohio expired in February. The company said at the time that it was seeking new permits that aligned with its goals of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. It subsequently unveiled a plastics recycling project for the state.

47

Sasol

2021 chemical sales: $9.0 billion

The main issue at Sasol for several years was a petrochemical complex in Lake Charles, Louisiana, that went $4 billion over budget and led to a major management shake-up. Another recent setback for the firm came in November, when South African regulators blocked the sale of its business in sodium cyanide to Draslovka, already a strong player in that field. Now there are signs of green shoots at the South African firm. Sasol and South Korea’s Lotte Chemical are studying the construction of a plant to make battery electrolyte solvents in Lake Charles or at Sasol’s complex in Marl, Germany. Sasol would provide the raw materials.

48

TongKun Group

2021 chemical sales: $9.0 billion

TongKun Group is one of a handful of integrated Chinese polyester producers that have grown so big in recent years that they are now finding their way into the Global Top 50. The company is based in Tongxiang, in the coastal Chinese province of Zhejiang. It was founded in 1981 with the name Tongxiang County Chemical Fiber Factory. TongKun now has more than 30,000 employees as well as 8.6 million metric tons (t) per year of polyester filament production capacity and 4.2 million t of capacity for the polyester raw material purified terephthalic acid.

49

Lanxess

2021 chemical sales: $8.9 billion

Lanxess is planning a likely exit from the polymer business. The German company and the private equity firm Advent International formed a joint venture to buy DSM’s engineering polymer business—a producer of high-end nylon resins—for $4.1 billion. Lanxess is contributing its own business, which makes polybutylene terephthalate and nylon 6, to the partnership. It will own an up to 40% stake in the joint venture for 3 years, after which it will have an option to sell. At the same time, Lanxess is growing in specialty chemicals. Earlier this month, it completed the purchase of International Flavors & Fragrances’ microbial control business for about $1.3 billion. The business, which once belonged to Dow, makes glutaraldehyde biocides and isothiazolinone-based antimicrobials and has $450 million in annual sales.

Despite that, the competition for this award was fierce. It came down to a straight fight between Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, with the former walking away with the prize in yet another impressive year.

Goldman completed six deals in Africa ex-Egypt worth a total of $42 billion, for a 74.8% share of the market, according to Dealogic. Each of the transactions on the list involved a South African buyer or a South Africa-based seller, or both.

The biggest transaction of the year by far was the $39.8 billion share swap finalized by Cape Town-based Naspers and Dutch conglomerate Prosus in August 2021. Goldman advised Prosus, a technology investor that was spun out of Naspers in 2019 to hold the South African group’s international holdings, which includes a 29% stake in Chinese technology firm Tencent.

Air Liquide to build two new hydrogen production units with carbon capture technology in Shanghai Chemical Industry ... - Air Liquide,"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5haXJsaXF1aWRlLmNvbS9ncm91cC9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy1uZXdzLzIwMjItMDctMTkvYWlyLWxpcXVpZGUtYnVpbGQtdHdvLW5ldy1oeWRyb2dlbi1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLXVuaXRzLWNhcmJvbi1jYXB0dXJlLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktc2hhbmdoYWktY2hlbWljYWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Shanghai Chemical Industry Park Industrial Gases Co., Ltd (SCIPIG), a subsidiary of Air Liquide, will invest more than 200 million euros to build two hydrogen production units and related infrastructure in Shanghai Chemical Industry Park (SCIP). These units will bring significant environmental benefits, as they are designed to replace current supply from a third party coal-based gasification unit, will be equipped with CO2 capture and recycle technology and will be connected to SCIPIG existing local network. These two units will come in addition to two other hydrogen units and four air separation units that SCIPIG already operates in the Park.

Through more than 15 year-long contracts, these units will produce hydrogen and carbon monoxide for the supply to Covestro China and Shanghai Lianheng Isocyanate Company (SLIC, a joint-venture led by BASF and Huntsman) in the Park, as well as mobility, other industrial and electronics customers in the Yangtze River Delta megalopolis. The two units will have a total hydrogen (H2) production capacity of around 70,000 Nm3/h. They will be equipped with units to capture and recycle carbon dioxide (CO2) to contribute to the production of carbon monoxide (CO) for a total capacity of 28,000 Nm3/h.

Planned to be operational in phases, starting from the year end 2023, the two Steam Methane Reformers (SMR), will be designed and built by Air Liquide Engineering & Construction. They would not only replace a third party coal-based gasification unit, but will also be equipped with CO2 recycle units and connected to the existing SCIPIG local network. This will avoid the emission of 350,000 tonnes of CO2 per year, which is comparable to the equivalent electricity-related emissions of 1 million Chinese households. Connecting the production units to SCIPIG’s local pipeline network will further enhance the reliability and flexibility of gas supply.

Air Liquide has been actively involved in the development of the Shanghai Chemical Industry Park since 1996. Host to major international and local chemical companies, the park covers 29,4 km2 and is located near the Shanghai Yangshan port, one of the busiest container ports in the world. Among other initiatives, Air Liquide recently announced the creation of a joint venture with Shenergy and SCIP to use the hydrogen produced by SCIPIG to supply hydrogen refueling stations across the Yangtze River Delta and support the fast growing hydrogen vehicles market in the region.

François Abrial, Member of the Air Liquide Group’s Executive Committee supervising Asia Pacific, said:

“These new investments further enhance Air Liquide’s long-term collaboration with Covestro, SLIC and Shanghai Chemical Industry Park. Leveraging our expertise in hydrogen production as well as carbon capture and utilization, the project demonstrates our capacity to bring solutions for our customers which are reliable, competitive, and beneficial to the environment. A specialist in the decarbonization of the industry, Air Liquide is proud, with this project, to support Shanghai’s ambitious climate plan. ”

Holly Lei, President of Covestro China, stated:

“We are pleased to further strengthen our partnership with SCIPIG in the Shanghai Chemical Industry Park. The new investment will provide a reliable supply of important raw materials to Covestro Integrated Site Shanghai. In addition, we will realize the synergy to reduce the carbon footprint of hydrogen, which as a fuel can contribute to a low-carbon mobility in the Yangtze River Delta Region. In this regard, our ambition to become climate neutral goes hand in hand along the value chain and beyond the company boundary.”

The Hydrogen Stream: Steam-based tech to produce 100 g of hydrogen from 1 kg of biomass - pv magazine International,"Fri, 15 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB2LW1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA3LzE1L3RoZS1oeWRyb2dlbi1zdHJlYW0tc3RlYW0tYmFzZWQtdGVjaC10by1wcm9kdWNlLTEwMC1nLW9mLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLWZyb20tMS1rZy1vZi1iaW9tYXNzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A team of researchers from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) has developed a technology to produce 100 g of hydrogen from 1 kg of biomass. “The process consists of two steps. In the first step, biomass is converted into syngas in a novel reactor using oxygen and steam. In the second step, pure hydrogen is generated from syngas using an indigenously developed low-pressure gas separation unit,” they said, noting that 60 g of hydrogen are present in 1 kg of biomass. According to their findings, the high yield has to do with the fact that steam participates in both homogenous and heterogeneous reactions. In homogeneous reactions, reactants are in a single phase, whereas in heterogeneous reactions, the reactants are in two or more phases. Solid carbon, which serves as a carbon sink, and carbon dioxide, which can be used in other processes, are the two carbon-based by-products, making the process carbon negative, said the researchers.

India’s ACME, Norway's Scatec, and Oslo-based Yara have signed a term sheet for offtake from the first phase of their green ammonia production plans in Oman. ACME and Scatec will begin developing the first phase of the project over 12 km2 of land to produce 100,000 metric tonnes of green ammonia per annum in the Special Economic Zone at Duqm. Once fully developed, a second phase will scale up production, which should reach 1.1 million tonnes annually. “The parties have agreed the principal terms for offtake of 100,000 tonnes annually of green ammonia in a first phase, and potential further offtake from the projects second phase as this develops. This agreement is groundbreaking for enabling the partners’ first green ammonia project in Oman,” said Scatec.

A Japanese consortium including Toshiba Energy and Osaka-based municipal utility Kansai Electric Power Corporation, will conduct a study on hydrogen production utilizing unused geothermal energy in Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan. The project period is from this July to March 2023. “Currently, a portion of geothermal steam is not fully utilized. Through this project, Toshiba ESS will investigate the effective use of unused steam to produce stable and low-cost green hydrogen,” said Toshiba. The hydrogen should be used for industries’ heat demand in the surrounding region. After the study, Toshiba ESS aims to deploy the resulting business model and use geothermal power plants in Japan and overseas to increase its hydrogen production.

Thyssengas is planning an 800-km hydrogen pipeline network in Germany by 2030. Thyssengas, which owns around 4,400 km of natural gas pipelines, is planning to retrofit around 18% of its network.

The extra cash will enable the company to finalise its aeronautics programme.

The round was backed by the French government via French Tech Souverainete, which is part of the France 2030 programme led by the General Secretariat for Investment (attached to the PM’s Office) and operated by Bpifrance, and the Principauté de Monaco via the Societe Nationale de Financement. FLYING WHALES’ current strategic shareholders ALIAD (Air Liquide’s venture capital fund) and ADP Group also participated in this round. Societe Generale Assurances and new private investors also participated.

Founded in 2012 by Sebastien Bougon, FLYING WHALES is developing a programme, LCA60T, a rigid airship for heavy load transport with a carrying capacity of 60 tons. The company is also creating FLYING WHALES SERVICES, the business that will run the LCA60T.

So, what’s next on the horizon for the platform? FLYING WHALES and its industrial coalition will speed up the work required to launch FLYING WHALES SERVICES and complete the development of the LCA60T aeronautical programme in France and Quebec, Canada.

Sebastien Bougon, chairman and CEO of FLYING WHALES said: “The aeronautical programme and its industrial implementation are well underway, and the development activities for the future airline and airport company, FLYING WHALES SERVICES, will be mature enough in 2023 to be spun off into a subsidiary, and thus accelerate both our already promising commercial activities and the implementation of the resources necessary for future LCA60T operations.”

Emmanuel Audouard, director of Bpifrance’s cross-functional VC investment division, said: “FLYING WHALES is one of the major bold industrial projects that have the ambition to profoundly revolutionise transportation as we know it – while contributing to its decarbonisation. Bpifrance is delighted to support the FLYING WHALES teams in this new phase of its development, towards the marketing of the LCA60T.”"

Biogas Market Growth & Trends



The global biogas market size is expected to reach USD 87.85 billion by 2030, according to a new report. The market is expected to expand at a CAGR of 4.3% from 2022 to 2030. Electricity was the dominant application segment in 2021 with a revenue share of 29.85%.

Shifting focus toward the use of renewable sources of energy, mainly in the electricity sector, has considerably boosted the demand for biogas in electricity applications. In addition, the growing need to reduce dependency on fossil fuels is forming lucrative prospects for biogas in applications such as vehicle fuel.



The growing trend of the circular economy, particularly in European countries, is shifting the focus of food and beverage industries towards proper management of food waste to attain a zero-waste economy. Therefore, companies such as Nestle S.A., PepsiCo, Inc., and Unilever plc have started directing some food waste to biogas production to generate power for manufacturing units.



The increasing adoption of biogas in Canada is a major growth driver for the growth of the market in North America. Biogas production is expected to increase to increasing demand for fuel with low emission of harmful gases and the need for a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.

Manufacturers of biogas are adopting strategies, such as mergers and acquisitions, to increase their market share and production capacity in the region. South Africa is expected to provide ample opportunities for the market on account of ongoing concerns regarding GHG emission levels in the country. The country is focusing on developing biogas production to limit carbon emissions in the country.

Air Liquide launches its biomethane activity in China - Air Liquide,"Tue, 12 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL2dyb3VwL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzLW5ld3MvMjAyMi0wNy0xMi9haXItbGlxdWlkZS1sYXVuY2hlcy1pdHMtYmlvbWV0aGFuZS1hY3Rpdml0eS1jaGluYdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide invested and will operate its first biomethane production unit in China by the end of 2022. Located in Huai’an City, in the Jiangsu Province, the unit will have a production capacity of 75 GWh per year. This project demonstrates a circular economy and low-carbon approach, in line with the Group’s Sustainable Objectives and strategic plan ADVANCE.

This new unit will produce biogas from agricultural and livestock waste coming from local farms and purify it into biomethane. With a total production capacity of 75 GWh/y, the unit will inject the biomethane into the city gas grid to be used for household consumption and also generate electricity for its own consumption and injection into the electrical grid.

The biomethane unit will follow a circular economy approach. The digestate, a byproduct material resulting from the biogas production, will be processed to produce bio-fertilizers. These bio-fertilizers will be used in the local agriculture, which, besides food products, will also generate some waste that will be processed in this unit to produce biomethane.

Biomethane has a high potential in China in particular as the Chinese government supports projects promoting the valorization of waste as part of its financial plans for the development of rural regions.

Air Liquide has developed competencies throughout the whole biomethane value chain, starting with biogas production from waste, to its purification into biomethane, liquefaction, storage, and transportation to distribution. Air Liquide now has 21 biomethane operational production units in the world for a yearly production capacity of about 1.4 TWh.

H1 2022 Results: Strong performance in a complex environment and confirmed resilience of the business model - Air Liquide,"Thu, 28 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5haXJsaXF1aWRlLmNvbS9ncm91cC9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy1uZXdzLzIwMjItMDctMjgvaDEtMjAyMi1yZXN1bHRzLXN0cm9uZy1wZXJmb3JtYW5jZS1jb21wbGV4LWVudmlyb25tZW50LWFuZC1jb25maXJtZWQtcmVzaWxpZW5jZS1idXNpbmVzcy1tb2RlbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Commenting on the 1st half of 2022, François Jackow, Chief Executive Officer of the Air Liquide Group, said:

“The Group delivered a very strong performance during the 1st half of 2022. This is even more remarkable considering the particularly complex macroeconomic and geopolitical context. Revenue reached 14.2 billion euros, an increase of +7.7% on a comparable basis. As published, revenue was up +31%, reflecting the sharp increase in energy prices in particular. Growth was achieved across all activities: Gas & Services, which represents 96 % of revenue, Engineering & Construction and Global Markets & Technologies. In Gas & Services, all geographies improved, driven mainly by Industrial Merchant and Electronics, which enjoyed strong growth particularly in Asia. In Industrial Merchant, value creation and dynamic price management allowed the Group to transfer the increase in costs, while in Large Industries, the increase in energy prices is contractually passed on to customers. In this context, the Group’s operating margin improved again significantly by +50 basis points, excluding the energy impact. The Group also continues taking efficiency measures, notably through targeted industrial investments. Recurring net profit[1] reached 1.6 billion euros, an increase of +20.4% excluding the currency impact. Net profit (Group share) was 1.3 billion euros, an increase as published of +5.3% despite a non-recurring provision on our assets in Russia. Cash flow remained high at 23.5%[2] of sales. The balance sheet is solid, with a net debt-to-equity ratio[3] down again to 46%. Recurring ROCE[4] continued to improve and reached 9.7% at the end of June, in line with the target of 10% by 2023. The Group maintained a strong investment momentum, which is a guarantee of future growth and the expression of its commitment to fight climate change. With more than 40% of projects linked to the energy transition, 12-month investment opportunities are numerous and total 3.3 billion euros. Investment decisions were high and reached 1.8 billion euros this half-year. The project backlog, at 3 billion euros, remains high. Given the strong performance in the 1st half of 2022, combined with a more resilient business model and a clear strategic plan, as well as committed teams, whose dedication I commend, we are entering the second half of the year. In 2022, assuming no significant economic disruption, Air Liquide is confident in its ability to further increase its operating margin and to deliver recurring net profit growth at constant exchange rates[5].”

Group revenue totaled 14,207 million euros in the 1st half of 2022, a strong comparable growth of +7.7%. Sales were up +7.5% on a comparable basis during the 2nd quarter of 2022 compared with the 2nd quarter of 2021. Group revenue as published increased significantly by +31.0% during the 1st half, with a very high energy impact of +16.8% as well as favorable currency (+5.8%) and significant scope (+0.7%) impacts.

This performance was delivered in a challenging context of exceptionally high energy prices, strong inflation, strain on supply chains and the war in Ukraine. The Group benefited from a solid business model and diversity of business reach in terms of geographies, businesses, end-markets and customers which ensured a resilient performance and allowed the Group to take advantage of all growth opportunities. Its core positioning in growth markets of the future (in particular the energy transition, Semiconductors and Healthcare) reinforces these attributes.

Gas & Services revenue amounted to 13,600 million euros during the 1st half, representing an increase of +7.2% on a comparable basis. Sales as published for the 1st half of 2022 showed extremely strong growth of +31.4%, with a very high energy impact at +17.6% as well as positive currency (+5.9%) and significant scope (+0.7%) impacts.

Gas & Services revenue in the Americas reached 5,017 million euros in the 1 st half of 2022, representing a very strong increase of +9.2% on a comparable basis. Large Industries was up +5.3%, driven by solid demand and the start-up of new units. The marked increase in prices contributed significantly to the high sales growth in Industrial Merchant (+11.6%). Healthcare revenue was up +2.2%, led by proximity care in the United States and Home Healthcare in Latin America, despite a decline in medical oxygen sales for the treatment of covid-19. Finally, all business segments within Electronics contributed to the particularly dynamic growth (+8.2%).

Revenue in Europe was up +6.4% on a comparable basis during the 1 st half of 2022 and reached 5,424 million euros . This strong growth was contrasted across the business lines in a context of exceptionally high energy prices and the war in Ukraine. Growth accelerated in Industrial Merchant, driven by record price increases, and reached a particularly high of +22.9% in the 1 st half, offsetting the -7.4% decline in Large Industries sales. Despite a high basis of comparison due to the covid-19 pandemic in 2021, Healthcare sales were up +3.3%, driven by the momentum in Home Healthcare.

Sales in Asia-Pacific were up + 5.5% on a comparable basis in the 1 st half of 2022 and totaled 2,746 million euros , driven by particularly dynamic growth in the Electronics business (+15.8%). Covid-19 related lockdowns in China during the 2 nd quarter had an impact on demand in other business lines: Large Industries sales were stable (-0.2%) in the 1 st half, whereas Industrial Merchant sales were up +2.5%, driven by the acceleration in price increases during the half-year.

Revenue in the Middle East and Africa totaled 413 million euros , representing a slight increase ( +0.9% ) on a comparable basis with the 1st half of 2021. Volumes increased sharply in South Africa with the integration of the 16 Sasol air separation units whose sales were recognized as part of the significant scope impact , and hence excluded from comparable growth. Sales were stable over the half-year in Industrial Merchant, with business line growth offset by two small divestitures in the Middle East.

Large Industries sales were contrasted by region and overall were down slightly (-1.4%) on a comparable basis with the 1st half of 2021: sales enjoyed sustained growth in the Americas, were stable in Asia, and were down in Europe. The Industrial Merchant business posted strong revenue growth of +12.7% in the 1st half, driven by the acceleration of pricing over the half-year and by solid volumes. Electronics sales growth momentum was particularly dynamic, at +15.5%, with a strong contribution from all business segments. In Healthcare, despite a decline in medical oxygen volumes for the treatment of covid-19, revenue was up +2.3% driven by the strong development in Home Healthcare, notably in Europe, and in proximity care in the United States.

Consolidated revenue from Engineering & Construction totaled 221 million euros in the 1st half of 2022, representing strong comparable growth of +29.0%. Order intake totaled 526 million euros, in line with the high level recorded in the 1st half of 2021.

Global Markets & Technologies sales totaled 386 million euros in the 1st half, representing marked comparable growth of +13.8%. The biogas business enjoyed strong momentum, benefiting from the ramp-up of new production units in Europe and the United States, the increase in sales prices relating to the spike in energy price, and equipment sales in the United States.

Efficiencies[6] amounted to 167 million euros and represented a saving of 2.1% of the cost base. In a context of high inflation unfavorable to procurement efficiencies, the priority for the teams is to limit cost increases and transfer them to sales prices.

Group Operating Income Recurring (OIR) reached 2,286 million euros in the 1st half of 2022, an increase of +17.4% and of +9.2% on a comparable basis, which is significantly higher than the comparable sales growth of +7.7%.

The operating margin (OIR to revenue ratio) stood at 16.1% as published, representing a -190 basis point decline compared with the 1st half of 2021 due mainly to the sharp increase in energy costs which are contractually passed through to Large Industries customers. This therefore has a dilutive impact on the published margin (without impacting operating income in absolute value). Excluding the energy impact, the operating margin improved very significantly by +50 basis points compared with the 1st half of 2021. This performance integrates the dilutive impact of strong inflation on costs other than energy costs and which is transferred to sales prices.

The net profit (Group share) amounted to 1,305 million euros in the 1st half of 2022, an increase of +5.3% as published. Excluding the exceptional provision on the Group’s industrial assets in Russia, which has no impact on cash, a provision for risks in the Engineering & Construction business, and an exceptional income from Air Liquide taking control of a joint venture in Asia-Pacific, recurring net profit (Group share)[7] reached 1,551 million euros. It increased by +25.1% and +20.4% excluding the currency impact, which is significantly higher than the comparable sales growth of +7.7% over the half-year. Net earnings per share rose by +5.0% compared with the 1st half of 2021, in line with the increase in net profit (Group share). These stood at 2.50 euros per share compared with 2.38 euros[8] per share in the 1st half of 2021.

Cash flow from operating activities before changes in net working capital amounted to 2,907 million euros during the 1st half of 2022, representing a sharp increase of +17.1% and +11.5% excluding the currency impact. This corresponds to a high level of 20.5% of sales and 23.5% excluding the energy impact, and represents a +60 basis point improvement excluding the energy impact compared with the 1st half of 2021.

Gross industrial capital expenditure amounted to 1,574 million euros, an increase of +9.4% compared with the 1st half of 2021 and of +4.7% excluding the currency impact. This represented 12.7% of sales excluding the energy impact, reflecting dynamic project development activity. Financial investments stood at 54 million euros compared with 569 million euros for the 1st half of 2021, including approximately 480 million euros for the acquisition of 16 Sasol air separation units in South Africa.

The net debt-to-equity ratio, adjusted for the seasonal effect of the dividend payment, stood at 46.0%, down sharply compared with 56.1% at the end of June 2021.

The return on capital employed after tax (ROCE) was 9.0% for the 1st half of 2022. Recurring ROCE[9] stood at 9.7%, an increase of +70 basis points compared with the 1st half of 2021.

In the 1st half of 2022, industrial and financial investment decisions totaled 1,796 million euros. This compares to 1,429 million euros during the 1st half of 2021, excluding the acquisition of Sasol’s Air Separation Units (ASUs) in South Africa for approximately 480 million euros.

The investment backlog remained high at 3.0 billion euros.

The additional contribution to revenue of unit start-ups and ramp-ups totaled 213 million euros over the 1st half of 2022. In 2022, the additional contribution to revenue of unit start-ups and ramp-ups is expected to be between 410 and 435 million euros.

The 12-month portfolio of investment opportunities stood at 3.3 billion euros at the end of June 2022. Projects related to the energy transition accounted for more than 40% of the portfolio. These notably included projects for renewable hydrogen production by water electrolysis, facilities for the capture of CO2 emitted by the Group’s or its customers’ units, as well as hydrogen mobility projects in Europe and Asia. The share of the Electronics business in the portfolio of opportunities increased and represented around 30%.

Viva, which supplies approximately 25% of Australia’s liquid fuel requirements, said the electrolyser will be the “largest in Australia by a considerable margin”, capable of producing more than 1,000 kilograms of green hydrogen per day.

“This equipment will be the first of its kind in the Australian market,” Viva said in a statement. “Once installed, it will be at least twice the size of any other electrolyser producing green hydrogen in the country.”

The MC500 containerised proton-exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyser will have a production capacity of up to 1,063kg per day, and will supply fuel cell grade hydrogen produced on site to the dedicated fuelling station. The electrolyser, which is expected to be delivered in the third quarter of 2023, will be powered by renewable electricity with Viva planning to deploy an up to 20 MW solar array as part of its Geelong Energy Hub.

Viva has also placed an order with French gas company Air Liquide for the provision of a ‘fast fill’ hydrogen refuelling package designed to refuel at least 10 trucks or buses consecutively.

The system will be capable of dispensing 300kg of hydrogen in under two hours. Viva said this will provide hydrogen customers with a similar refuelling experience to today’s traditional service station.

Viva said the purchase orders are critical first steps in the company’s vision to establish “Australia’s most ambitious hydrogen mobility project”, which is expected to be the catalyst for a network of hydrogen refuelling stations located on key transport routes up Australia’s east coast, connecting Geelong and Melbourne to Sydney and Brisbane.

Viva, which supplies a service station network of about 1,350 Shell and Liberty service stations across Australia, said the New Energies Service Station is expected to commence operations in late 2023. The company said as well as offering commercial hydrogen refuelling facilities, it will also offer electric vehicle (EV) recharging.

The confirmation of the electrolyser purchase comes with the New South Wales (NSW) and Victorian governments announcing plans to work together to deliver Australia’s first renewable hydrogen highway.

The NSW and Victorian governments said on Monday they have each invested $10 million in grant funding for the Hume Hydrogen Highway, a joint grant initiative to support the development of at least four refuelling stations along the highway and approximately 25 hydrogen-powered trucks.

NSW Treasurer Matt Kean said applications are now open for $20 million in grant funding to support the design and delivery of renewable hydrogen trucking along Australia’s busiest freight corridor.

“This initiative aims to show the potential of renewable hydrogen for heavy vehicles with the goal of transitioning the freight sector to zero emissions energy sources,” he said, adding the project is “expected to drive uptake of renewable hydrogen in the heavy transport sector”.

Victoria’s Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio said transport accounts for 25% of Victoria’s total carbon footprint and the green hydrogen highway would help drive down emissions.

“Australia’s busiest corridor is the perfect place to kickstart the transition to a zero-emission freight sector,” she said. “The renewable hydrogen highway will create new jobs, drive investment across the east coast and is a landmark step towards meeting Victoria’s target to halve emissions by 2030 as we work towards net-zero by 2050.”

Kean said the Hume Hydrogen Highway is the first initiative of a statewide hydrogen refuelling network.

“What we’re looking for is strong industry collaboration between refuelling station operators, fleet operators, truck manufacturers, major freight customers, and other entities which will be vital to the success of the initiative,” he said.

The Victorian, NSW and Queensland governments will collaborate on the development of the renewable hydrogen highway by 2026, focusing on the Hume Highway, the Pacific Highway and the Newell Highway.

Grant applications close 21 October 2022. The successful applicant must enter into a joint funding agreement with both governments.

Queensland is also looking to establish a hydrogen refuelling network with bp Australia recently announcing it has teamed with gas and engineering company BOC to build a green hydrogen refuelling facility at its Port of Brisbane service station in Queensland.

The refuelling facility will dispense green hydrogen produced by BOC at its nearby Bulwer Island production site. The green hydrogen will be produced by a 220 kW electrolyser powered by a 100 kW solar installation."
Houlder wins reliquefaction plant gig for Avenir LNG's bunkering newbuild - LNG Prime,"Tue, 26 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vbG5ncHJpbWUuY29tL2NvbnRyYWN0cy1hbmQtdGVuZGVycy9ob3VsZGVyLXdpbnMtcmVsaXF1ZWZhY3Rpb24tcGxhbnQtZ2lnLWZvci1hdmVuaXItbG5ncy1idW5rZXJpbmctbmV3YnVpbGQvNTc4MTQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Small-scale player Avenir LNG has awarded a reliquefaction plant contract to UK-based engineer Houlder for its 20,000-cbm LNG bunkering and supply vessel, Avenir Achievement.

Houlder said in a social media post on Monday it won the detailed design and engineering for the retrofit of an Air Liquide boil-off Gas (BOG) reliquefaction plant.

This work follows the successful completion of basic design and engineering by Houlder in the first quarter of this year, it said.

Avenir took delivery of this vessel from China’s Nantong CIMC SOE in May. Avenir Achievement and its sister vessel, Hai Gang Wei Lai, which Avenir sold to a Chinese JV, are the world’s largest LNG bunkering ships.

Starting in the first quarter of 2023, the vessel will serve LNG giant Shell for a period of three years with an option to extend up to five years.

Prior to that, US LNG player New Fortress Energy will use the ship for a period of six months.

Vessel to get the plant prior to Shell charter

According to Houlder, the installation of the new subcooler plant would take place at the end of 2022, ahead of the vessel’s charter with Shell.

The new TBF700 plant has capacity to reliquefy up to 1Te of BOG per hour.

Also, the system would allow Avenir Achievement to maintain its LNG cargo at a low temperature, avoiding “LNG ageing” and maintaining cargo characteristics when bunkering, Houlder said.

The system prevents losses during idle periods, permitting reliquefication of received cargo vapor after bunkering operations, further reducing wasted cargo and greenhouse gas emissions, it said.

Houlder did not reveal the financial details of the contract."
Daimler tests fuel-cell truck with liquid hydrogen - Autocar Professional,"Mon, 04 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9jYXJwcm8uaW4vbmV3cy1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL2RhaW1sZXItdGVzdHMtZnVlbGNlbGwtdHJ1Y2std2l0aC1saXF1aWQtaHlkcm9nZW4tODIxMjDSAWpodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdXRvY2FycHJvLmluL25ld3MtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9kYWltbGVyLXRlc3RzLWZ1ZWxjZWxsLXRydWNrLXdpdGgtbGlxdWlkLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLTgyMTIwP2FtcD0x?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Since last year, a Mercedes-Benz GenH2 Truck fuel-cell prototype has been undergoing intensive testing. Now another prototype is being tested for the use of liquid hydrogen.

Daimler Truck is working together with Linde on the development of a new process for handling liquid hydrogen which enables even higher storage density and easier refuelling compared to LH2.

During the refuelling process, cryogenic liquid hydrogen at minus 253deg Celsius is filled into two 40kg tanks mounted on either side of the chassis.

The development objective of the series-ready GenH2 Truck is a range of up to 1,000 kilometres and more.

Daimler Truck is onto its next milestone on the road to sustainable transportation also with hydrogen-based drives. Since last year, a Mercedes-Benz GenH2 Truck fuel-cell prototype has been undergoing intensive testing – both on the in-house test track and on public roads. Daimler Truck is now putting another prototype into operation to test the use of liquid hydrogen. A test drive was conducted a few days ago in Worth am Rhein, Germany.

A newly installed prototype filling station at the development and testing centre in Worth enables the refuelling with liquid hydrogen. Recently, Daimler Truck undertook the first successful liquid hydrogen (LH2) refuelling of the truck together with Air Liquide.

During the refuelling process, cryogenic liquid hydrogen at minus 253deg Celsius is filled into two 40kg tanks mounted on either side of the chassis. Thanks to the particularly good insulation of the vehicle tanks, the hydrogen can be kept at temperature for a sufficiently long time without active cooling.

Daimler Truck prefers liquid hydrogen in the development of hydrogen-based drives. In this aggregate state the energy carrier has a significantly higher energy density in relation to volume compared to gaseous hydrogen. As a result, more hydrogen can be carried, which significantly increases the range and enables comparable performance of the vehicle with that of a conventional diesel truck.



The development objective of the series-ready GenH2 Truck is a range of up to 1,000 kilometres and more. This makes the truck suitable for flexible and demanding applications, especially in the important segment of heavy-duty long-haul transport. The start of series production for hydrogen-based trucks is planned for the second half of the decade.

Committed to hydrogen

Daimler Truck is working together with Linde on the development of a new process for handling liquid hydrogen (‘subcooled” liquid hydrogen, sLH2 technology’). Among other things, this innovative approach enables even higher storage density and easier refuelling compared to LH2.

The companies plan for the first refuelling of a prototype vehicle at a pilot station in Germany in 2023. Daimler Truck and its partners are planning for a high level of transparency and openness around the relevant interfaces of the jointly developed sLH2 technology. The goal is to collaborate with other companies and associations as possible to develop their own refuelling and vehicle technologies that apply the new liquid-hydrogen standard and thereby establish a global mass market for the new process.

When it comes to infrastructure for hydrogen filling stations along important transport routes in Europe, Daimler Truck is planning to work together with the companies Shell, BP and TotalEnergies. Daimler Truck is also a shareholder in hydrogen filling station operator H2 MOBILITY Deutschland. In addition, Daimler Truck, IVECO, Linde, OMV, Shell, TotalEnergies and the Volvo Group have committed to work together to help create the conditions for the mass-market roll-out of hydrogen trucks in Europe as part of the H2Accelerate (H2A) interest group.

On its path towards a CO2-neutral future Daimler Truck has clearly set its strategic course and is consistently pursuing a dual-track strategy in the electrification of its portfolio with both battery-electric and hydrogen-based drives. The ambition is to offer only new vehicles that are carbon-neutral in driving operation in its global core markets by 2039."
"This entrepreneur quit her job in gas and oil to make a ginger beer, now it is in big stores - News24","Sun, 31 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzMjQuY29tL25ld3MyNC9iaS1hcmNoaXZlL3RoaXMtZW50cmVwcmVuZXVyLXF1aXQtaGVyLWpvYi10by1tYWtlLWEtZ2luZ2VyLWJlZXItZHJpbmstdGhhdC1pcy1zdG9ja2VkLWJ5LXRoZS1tYWpvci1yZXRhaWxlcnMtMjAyMi030gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This article forms part of the archives of Business Insider South Africa, which was published as a partnership between News24 and Insider Inc between 2018 and 2023.

After struggling to balance work and taking care of a young family, Mpho Mohaswa quit her job to start her beverage company, Precious and Pearl Brands.

The company manufactures ready-to-drink ginger beer and concentrates.

It comes convenient for those ginger beer lovers hosting weddings, big events, and funerals who would otherwise have to brew their own for days.

Mohaswa’s beverages, after five years of operating, is now stocked in Food Lover’s Market, Pick n Pay, Spar, Takealot, and Makro.

A decision to ditch her corporate job in the oil and gas industry after struggling to balance her work and home life led to Mpho Mohaswa’s venture, a ready-to-drink ginger beer juice that caught the eye of major retailers in the country.

The Limpopo-bred entrepreneur, who grew up in the small town of Burgersfort in the Spekboom River Valley, has a chemical engineering qualification and had a job as a business developer at Air Liquide.

Her job involved a lot of work-related travel - her husband travelled frequently for work as well. After the birth of their first child Mohaswa left her job in 2017 to focus on the couple's growing family.

“So, we had to compromise, and it had to be me at the time,” Mohaswa said.

While she had the ginger beer idea, it was nothing close to solid, and she had to go through a trial-and-error phase that took six months, mixing and developing a formula in her garage.

Soon after, she founded her beverage company, Precious and Pearl Brands, which makes ready-to-drink and concentrate ginger beer under the brand, Ghemere. Ginger beer in South Africa is a quintessential drink enjoyed at ceremonies such as weddings, funerals, and other gatherings. It uses yeast as a key ingredient and is typically fermented over a couple of days.

The Ghemere ready-to-drink and concentrate products are a convenient fix for event organisers who would otherwise have to spend days making traditional ginger beer.

Developing a ginger beer product with a long shelf life was essential for Mohaswa, whose chemical engineering degree came in handy in developing it, she says.

“I had different raw materials that I would test on the product itself. Our ginger beer doesn’t ferment, we don’t use raw materials that make it ferment, we have preservatives in the product,” she said.

Her product landed its first spot on a retail shelf at Food Lover’s Market, where she doorstopped a store manager with product samples. After gaining traction from the Food Lover’s Market deal, she managed to acquire retail shelf space at the likes of Shoprite, Spar, Takealot, and Makro.

It also bagged whiskey brand, Firstwatch’s inaugural entrepreneur’s challenge.

Mohaswa said the company is working on reintroducing a line of flavours for the beverage, which she said had previously been launched prematurely. With its original ginger beer now enjoying steady growth, the time will be ripe to bring in the flavours next year.

The drink will soon come in four more flavours: mango and orange, apple, pineapple, and strawberry."
