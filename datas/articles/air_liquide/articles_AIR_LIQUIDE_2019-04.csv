Yokogawa Helping Air Liquide Achieve Digital Transformation of Process Control - ARC Advisory Group,"Wed, 03 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyY3dlYi5jb20vYmxvZy95b2tvZ2F3YS1oZWxwaW5nLWFpci1saXF1aWRlLWFjaGlldmUtZGlnaXRhbC10cmFuc2Zvcm1hdGlvbi1wcm9jZXNzLWNvbnRyb2zSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Arnold “Marty” Martin is Director, Process Control Technology at Air Liquide USA. As we learned during his presentation at ARC’s February 2019 Forum in Orlando, Florida, his company has been hard at work moving with its customer-centric, “NEOS 2016–2020” initiative. The company is looking for greater than 10 percent return after five to six years. Internally, it has coined the term “SIO,” which stands for Smarter, more Innovative Operations. Fundamentally, it is a digital transformation of process control (Industry 4.0) initiative.

Working with Yokogawa’s PACE product

Mr. Martin mentioned several suppliers that have been helpful. He cited Yokogawa’s PACE Advanced Process Control product in particular. Part of Air Liquide’s program included an essential sub-program called “SURE,” which stands for Software Utility for Real-time Efficiency. Prior to standardizing on this product, the company was using what he called a “garage shop” multivariable process control (MVPC) technology and found this product far superior.

According to Mr. Martin, control modernization is “the hardest thing in the universe to cost justify,” but is essential to enable the company’s plants to meet the needs of its customers. To succeed in control modernization, the company not only needs solid support from its suppliers, but also reusable standards to help create a platform from which to leverage modern technology for its Center of Excellence (COE).

Mr. Martin also emphasized the importance of enabling and empowering personnel. Using machine learning and other artificial intelligence and analytics technologies, the company’s goal is to lessen the burden on its internal experts while providing operating personnel with the information they need to make good decisions. “If you know something is happening, you can do something about it before a failure occurs,” according to Mr. Martin.

Air Liquide has had excellent results so far and is averaging about one-year ROI on over $8 million in investments to date. This would not be possible without the transformational change in attitude that is permeating the company. People are critical, and they need modern tools to do their work. With the reality of workers changing more rapidly than in the past, it is essential to have a training and transition plan in place, and to “stick to it,” according to Mr. Martin.

Let ARC Help with Digital Transformation of Process Control

ARC has been working with manufacturers to help them find the right solutions in their Digital Transformation journey. Based on what we heard and saw at the recent ARC Industry Forum, several companies, like Air Liquide, have made considerable progress in not only transforming their technologies, but also identifying the benefits of proceeding with digital transformation projects.

ARC recommends the following actions for owner-operators and their teams responsible for operational technology, which include their preferred suppliers/partners:

Understand your corporate business objectives and align digital transformation strategies with these.

Assess the performance of your plant (or plants) to find the gaps and missing potential value. Express these opportunities and gaps in terms of business value, rather than technical terms, such as failure rates, transition times, or other non-financial metrics. This is a team effort.

Develop a strategic plan to improve performance – beginning with the highest value/lowest risk opportunities identified by the assessment.

Perhaps most important, is to make sure that the corporate executives agree with what you and your team are doing. Ultimately, your team’s findings should be considered along with other CapEx opportunities to maximize asset capabilities throughout the enterprise.

Air Liquide fined for ammonia leak - Cooling Post,"Tue, 23 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvb2xpbmdwb3N0LmNvbS93b3JsZC1uZXdzL2Fpci1saXF1aWRlLWZpbmVkLWZvci1hbW1vbmlhLWxlYWsv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CANADA: Industrial and medical gases manufacturer Air Liquide Canada has been fined CAD$100,000 (€66,000) for the release of around 815kg of ammonia.

The court in Sarnia heard that the leak occurred in 2017 from an ammonia refrigeration system at the company’s facility in the County of Lambton, southwest Ontario. The plant produces food grade carbon dioxide and is supplied with raw carbon dioxide from a neighbouring supplier.

The carbon dioxide flows from the supplier through a dedicated pipeline, which is then liquefied and purified with the assistance of an ammonia-based refrigeration system.

The Air Liquide facility is staffed during daytime hours seven days a week but does not have staff on-site during the night.

In the early morning hours of April 16, 2017, when no staff were at the facilty, the flow of raw CO2 unexpectedly increased. As a result, raw carbon dioxide exceeded the refrigeration capacity at the facility and caused approximately 815kg of ammonia to vent through cooling system pressure release valves.

Two employees at a distribution plant, approximately 1km downwind from the facility, were forced to seek shelter from the ammonia release, leaving the distribution plant unattended and creating a potentially dangerous situation.

The company was convicted of one violation under Canada’s Environmental Protection Act and was fined CAD$100,000 plus a victim fine surcharge of CAD$25,000, with eight months to pay the fine."

Inside NET Power: Gas Power Goes Supercritical - POWER magazine,"Mon, 01 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvd2VybWFnLmNvbS9pbnNpZGUtbmV0LXBvd2VyLWdhcy1wb3dlci1nb2VzLXN1cGVyY3JpdGljYWwv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A project to demonstrate a novel power cycle that promises to produce low-cost, reliable, and flexible power from natural gas—while generating no atmospheric emissions, and fully capturing carbon dioxide—is inching closer to commissioning. Its developers are now actively assessing siting for the first commercial-scale 300-MW NET Power facility.





NET Power’s 50 MWth Demonstration Plant in La Porte, Texas (PRNewsfoto/NET Power, LLC)

A mere 10 years ago, 8 Rivers Capital, a startup founded in 2007 by Bill Brown, a former Wall Street investor and Duke University law school professor, and Dr. Miles Palmer, an engineer and entrepreneur, gave up on trying to “fix” avatars of the same costly fossil-fired power solutions to make them integral in a clean energy future. They decided, instead, to design a fossil-based system from the ground up.

“What they do in a lean innovation model is they take a bunch of people who’ve been successful before, throw them into a shoe box, throw some cash into the shoe box, punch some holes in the bottom. And those people take the cash and iterate by throwing an unformed idea out into the market,” Brown, who is now the CEO of Durham, North Carolina–based NET Power, told POWER in March. “We turned the shoe box upside down. Instead of finding a pre-existing team from another startup, we decided to do it differently.”

To flesh out the firm’s ideas, he said, the company would ask a firm with necessary expertise for feedback. In that way, “Before we got any money, we had gone through many major corporations,” looking for that ideal opportunity. “We threw an idea to them, and they’d throw it back, saying, ‘Don’t do that—don’t do coal—do gas,’ ” he said. Then, in 2009, at the urging of an old college friend from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Brown got on the phone with Rodney Allam. “After an hour or two, I thought, no one knows this much,” he said.

Allam, who was a former head of technology development at Air Products, described a new thermodynamic cycle, which he claimed, controlled all emissions from the outset (see sidebar, “How the Allam Cycle Works.”). After meeting Allam, and doing his own due diligence, Brown separately approached both Babcock and Wilcox and the Shaw Group for a quote on a pre-FEED (front-end engineering and design) for a test facility. “But when Shaw came back, they said, ‘Well, actually, we’d like to invest,’ ” as Brown recalls.

By June 2012, 8 Rivers had gained several interested backers. Along with Shaw—which in 2013 became part of CB&I, a company that last year merged with McDermott International—Exelon Generation signed on. Shaw would acquire a “substantial ownership position” in NET Power, and engineer, procure, and build the demonstration plant. Exelon, meanwhile, would spearhead permitting for a small-scale testing site, as well as test and commission the facility, supply its fuel, and market its output. As well as providing operations and maintenance support, Exelon held options for the first full-scale commercial plants. That month, NET Power also secured a key partnership with Toshiba Corp., which announced it would develop NET Power’s novel gas-fired generation technology.

As Mike Pacilio, executive vice president and chief operating officer with Exelon Generation, described it, the opportunity was too good to skip for the company that operates the largest fleet of low-carbon generators in the U.S., and has a long history as an innovation backer. “When we first assessed NET Power in 2012, we saw an opportunity to leverage Exelon Generation’s expertise in clean energy innovation and operational excellence to help develop and commercialize this novel, zero-emission, natural gas-fueled electric generation technology,” he told POWER in March. Exelon, specifically, was looking at the future. “Exelon Generation operates America’s lowest carbon fleet, by far. NET Power would make it possible to develop natural gas-fueled electric generation facilities with zero-carbon emissions, which could make our fleet even cleaner over time,” he said.

McDermott, which is a licensor of proprietary petrochemicals, refining, gasification and gas processing technologies, agreed, saying it also recognizes the potential and value of what it said was a “next-generation technology. As it told POWER in April, “In addition, as the EPC contractor for NET Power, this gives us tremendous potential to provide sustainable energy infrastructure solutions and be at the forefront of a new era of energy.”

How the Allam Cycle Works While research and development is underway on several supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO 2 ) cycles, the Allam Cycle, which was designed within the last decade, has emerged as a key forerunner. NET Power’s first plant in La Porte, Texas, is a 50-MWth (25-MWe) plant that will demonstrate the cycle with natural gas. The $150 million project, which was scaled down from a 500-MWth pre-FEED design (to ensure scalability) includes all Allam Cycle components, and it will demonstrate full operation tests, including startup, shutdown, ramping, and hot, warm, and cold starts. It will also demonstrate first-of-a-kind engineering, and first-of-a-kind construction, as well as ensure the CO 2 quality can be confirmed for offtake viability. According to the company, the full-scale unit will run at a potential net efficiency of 55.1%. “By slightly increasing the capital spent on heat exchangers and other plant components, we can boost the efficiency of the plant to 58.9% efficiency, which allows for the same amount of power to be made with less fuel. This will be attractive in countries with higher gas prices,” an 8 Rivers spokesperson told POWER. If the demonstration phase is successful, NET Power says it could begin global deployment of 300-MWe commercial plants as early as 2021. The Allam Cycle is a specialized sCO 2 system that is directly fired with oxy-fuel, and which recycles its exhaust heat. Another way to think about it is that it is essentially “any supercritical CO 2 Brayton cycle that is oxy-fueled and direct-fired; it recuperates turbine exhaust heat via a recycle stream; it is able to use a heat source in addition to the turbine exhaust; and it uses a turbine inlet temperature above 800C (1,000C to 1,200C optimal) and inlet pressure above 80 bar (200 bar to 400 bar optimal),” a spokesman said. (For more about the varied array of sCO 2 cycles under development, see “What Are SCO 2 Cycles?“.) At the La Porte demonstration, the natural gas is combusted with a mixture of hot, recuperated CO 2 and oxygen (which is piped in from an adjacent Air Liquide facility). “Burning oxygen instead—known as oxy-combustion—is usually challenging economically because oxygen is expensive to produce,” the company says. “NET Power overcomes this problem by recuperating the majority of the produced CO 2 into the combustor, dramatically lowering oxygen requirements.” The resulting working fluid—which is now a mix of high-pressure CO 2 and water—is then expanded through a turbine and then cooled in a heat exchanger (a recuperator). This process condenses the water and allows it to be separated out, leaving a nearly pure vapor-phase CO 2 stream. That CO 2 stream is compressed and pumped back up to high pressure, and the excess CO 2 is sent to a pipeline, ready for export. The remaining stream is reheated in a recuperator and makes its way back to the combustor, where the hot, high-pressure CO 2 helps the combustor achieve a final inlet temperature of about 1,150C as it combusts with a fresh stream of natural gas and oxygen.

A Long List of Benefits

According to NET Power, the two most significant ways the Allam cycle makes oxy-combustion economic are by “relying on a more efficient core power cycle,” and by recycling heat within the system to reduce the oxygen and natural gas consumption, and associated costs of the air separation unit. The process is also environmentally friendly, it notes, because it produces no emissions—a major consideration as the decarbonization movement increasingly grips the power sector. Water, which is used at the demonstration, is also negotiable. “By switching to air cooling, NET Power plants actually become net producers of water while only seeing a minor efficiency reduction,” the company says.

Beyond that, the company also touts the technology’s operational flexibility, claiming turndown capabilities are beyond combined cycle and comparable ramping ability. “The ramp-rate could be 2% to 5% per minute from warm to hot start,” a spokesperson said. And, because the technology’s performance is resistant to ambient condition changes—such as altitude—a plant can be designed to use no water, and the technology could create new siting opportunities, for example, in non-attainment zones.

A Pioneering Business Model

But another aspect about the novel project that is frequently cited by interested parties is its potential to draw revenue streams from byproducts along with sales of the electricity it produces.

As NET Power notes, the plant is inherently designed to capture CO 2 and generate it as a “low-cost, pipeline-ready byproduct.” And, as a spokesperson told POWER, “a single plant is capable of producing enough CO 2 to justify a 57-mile pipeline.” For now, the company anticipates that recent passage of 45Q carbon capture tax credits and growing needs for low-cost CO 2 for industrial processes—such as for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), where injected CO 2 can increase oil recovery by 10% to 25%—are poised to boost global demand of its technology.

The company says it is already “working with” an array of potential customers, including with oil and gas industries, on development opportunities. Last November, for example, it struck an investment deal (that is still awaiting regulatory approval) with Oxy Low Carbon Ventures, a subsidiary of international oil and gas exploration and production company Occidental Petroleum Corp, which uses CO 2 for EOR. Though details are sparse, Occidental Petroleum’s Senior Vice President of Operations Support Richard Jackson noted in a press release, the “innovative low-carbon technology solutions will grow Occidental’s business while reducing emissions.”

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), too, seemingly recognizes this game-changing quality. In its December 2018–released proposed revisions of the greenhouse gas emissions rule for new or modified units, the agency declined to determine that carbon capture and storage (CCS) or partial CCS was a best system of emission reduction (BSER) for new natural gas–feed stationary combustion turbines because it “is exorbitantly expensive, has not been adequately demonstrated, and would not be available for a large number of existing sources.” It noted, however, “similar technologies—such as use of the novel Allam Cycle—are, while seemingly promising, still in the early demonstration phase.” The note suggests that if the Allam Cycle is commercialized, it is likely the agency could reconsider part of its finding—which would amount to a boon for NET Power’s proprietary technology.

As significantly, project partners are now also exploring ways to allow NET Power plants to also “co-generate nitrogen, argon, and process heat,” which would “drive lower-cost, lower-carbon industrial processes, such as cheap, zero-carbon hydrogen production,” Brown said.

At the same time, the company is looking at the technology’s potential to use flare and waste gases (including associated, acid, and sour gases) in the combustion process. That aspect “integrates directly with operations of oil producers,” Brown noted. Yet another avenue for growth involves integration with liquefied natural gas regasification terminals, where it could provide high-efficiency power generation and eliminate the need for gas-fired regasification.

Demonstration of a Coal-Fired Allam Cycle Project

Meanwhile, 8 Rivers Energy is also separately pushing development of a 5-MW project to demonstrate a coal-fired Allam Cycle. The DOE has furnished the Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC) at the University of North Dakota and 8 Rivers Capital with $700,000 (of a total project cost of $875,000) for the first phase of the project, which will end on July 31, 2019, and entail evaluation of the appropriate scale and candidate host sites for a large coal-based Allam Cycle pilot plant. “There is potential for greater funding in the future, but that has not yet been granted,” an 8 Rivers spokesman said. Sites under consideration include the La Porte site, EERC’s facility, and Basin Electric’s Great Plains Synfuels Plant. The Lignite Energy Council also says the Allam cycle is part of its quest to find carbon dioxide solutions.

The EERC in November 2018 suggested it could receive DOE funding for two other phases. In Phase II, expected to run a year, developers would conduct the FEED, and in Phase III, which would span five years, developers would build and operate the pilot. DOE funding for all three phases could amount to $44 million. The development team has submitted an application for Phase II, which was due on March 31.

Yet, the Allam cycle’s coal potential may not be so straightforward, Leslie Sloss, a technical expert with the IEA Clean Coal Centre, noted in a recent paper. “For this technology to run with coal, all the clean-up steps that would generally be involved with a coal gasification project are required, and therefore it would be more complex. However, this is currently available and proven technology on existing gasification and [integrated gasification combined cycle] plants,” she said.

Among technical changes she noted are the combustor “may need to be redesigned to handle gasified coal.” Removal of impurities such as NO x and SO 2 could be achieved as nitric and sulphuric acid, using well-demonstrated methods used in oxy-fuel combustion systems, she said, however.

The Road to Technical Achievement

To reap its vast potential, NET Power must first successfully complete the demonstration. That road has been ridden with technical challenges, and despite ambitions to begin operating commercial plants within the next five years, project development, which has been ongoing since 2010, has been delayed by a series of technical hurdles.

On May 30, 2018—after two years of quiet development—NET Power marked perhaps its most important milestone: It achieved first-fire of a commercial-scale 50-MWth combustor that was engineered and manufactured by Toshiba Energy Systems & Solutions in cooperation with Parametric Solutions, a U.S.-based gas turbine components engineering firm.

The achievement is especially remarkable considering that due to its nearly closed-loop process, the Allam cycle relies on a delicate balance of heating, cooling, compression, and venting. “Every aspect of the compressor-turbine train—from aerodynamics and process control to lube oil and seal support systems—have to be carefully considered to prevent damaging or hazardous conditions,” a spokesperson told POWER. Efficiency is also key. The main strengths of the direct sCO 2 cycle are rooted in its inherent ability to capture carbon dioxide at high pressures—between 30 bar and 300 bar—which are not typical of a CO 2 storage system. This requires compact turbomachinery and micro-channel heat exchanger designs that can perform the large thermal recuperation it needs.

Exelon Generation’s Pacilio acknowledged that the biggest technical hurdle the project has faced was the design and testing of the first-of-its-kind sCO2 combustor. The combustor, now fully demonstrated, “is the same size as the ones that will be used in commercial units,” he said.

According to Toshiba’s engineers, the solution combined the company’s gas turbine and steam turbine technology. “Regarding gas turbines, Toshiba has technologies for air-cooled nozzles and blades and, also, combustion in the air with a pressure of around 2 MPa [megapascal] and a temperature up to 1,500C. Regarding steam turbines, Toshiba has developed and commercialized USC [ultrasupercritical] steam turbines in [the 1990s], and are now developing advanced USC (A-USC ) steam turbines. Their conditions are around 24 MPa and 600C for USC and around 31 MPa and 700C for A-USC,” it said.

The engineering challenges were hefty. The system’s “inlet pressure is 30 MPa, which is much higher than those of current commercialized gas turbines. And the inlet temperature is 1,150C, which is much higher than those of commercialized [USC] steam turbines and is the same level as those of so-called E-class gas turbines,” the company said.

First, the engineers applied a double-shelled structure for the turbine and combustor—such as is common for USC steam turbines. It also leveraged its A-USC expertise to develop high-temperature materials for the casings and rotors in the sCO 2 turbine. Engineering a durable thermal barrier coating (TBC), which they noted plays a crucial role in the sCO 2 turbine and combustor’s cooling design (because temperature differences through the TBC in an sCO 2 turbine is almost double that of conventional air-cooled gas turbines), posed as significant an engineering challenge. The company also engineered highly efficient cooling technologies, including cooling nozzles and blades, to manage the cycle’s extreme heat flux.

But finessing the technology has proven slower than expected. When Toshiba first announced it would develop the next thermal generation power system in June 2012, the company and partners Shaw Group, Exelon, and NET Power aimed to demonstrate the 25-MWe Allam cycle natural gas plant by mid-2014, planning a full-scale 250-MW commercial plant by 2017. However, while Toshiba wrapped up a six-month test to validate the combustor in August 2013 at a California facility (using a model that was a fifth of the one installed at NET Power), Toshiba first announced that it would supply the first-of-its-kind turbine in October 2014. The partners didn’t fully assemble and complete high-speed balancing tests for the rotor until August 2016. By October 2016, however, the turbine had been fully assembled and shipped to La Porte.

New Means and Future Potential

Yet, despite work to refine the project’s nits, Brown told POWER, “it is almost a mistake to call this a demo facility as it’s really a sophisticated test facility for the cycle and various components.” The company is so confident that while the full performance evaluation is underway at the 50-MWth natural gas demonstration, it has completed a pre-FEED study for a full 300-MWe commercial plant, and steps were underway to begin FEED and early development work.

Pacilio, who noted Exelon Generation has a contract with NET Power through which it provides oversight of engineering, construction, commissioning, and operations of the demonstration facility, said the company is “actively assessing siting” for the first commercial-scale 300-MW NET Power facility. “There are many factors that will go into identifying the best sites for the first commercial NET Power units. The market for NET Power projects will also include sites where geologic storage is suitable,” he said.

For Brown, NET Power’s most winning aspect is its ability to call on partners for sound advice. NET Power executives, Charlie Bowser, president, and Paul McDonough, vice president of Operations and Construction, for example, are “on loan” from Exelon to enable NET Power to leverage Exelon’s expertise in gas power operations, engineering, and maintenance. “Exelon also provides technical and commercial oversight to the NET Power leadership team through two board members, Ron DeGregorio, past president of Exelon Power, and me,” Pacilio said.

For now, NET Power is gearing up for a surge in interest in the technology and its potential. So far, NET Power has staffed a commercial team to provide front-end engineering design support and feasibility study support to potential customers. The company also has a financial plan in place to support adequate staffing as the technology further commercializes, Pacilio noted.

Two more air separation plans in works - Finance and Commerce,"Thu, 25 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS1jb21tZXJjZS5jb20vMjAxOS8wNC90d28tbW9yZS1haXItc2VwYXJhdGlvbi1wbGFucy1pbi13b3Jrcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Listen to this article Listen to this article

There must be something in the Minnesota air.

Over an eight-day span in December 2018, three different companies announced plans to build new air separation plants to sell liquid oxygen, nitrogen and argon to industrial, medical and other users in the upper Midwest. One, a $54 million project by Philadelphia-based Airgas, has already received approvals to begin construction in Cottage Grove.

On Tuesday, a second project moved forward after the Faribault City Council voted to approve several variances needed by Absolute Air LLC for a $32 million plant in the southern Minnesota city. Absolute, a joint venture by five smaller gas and welding supply distributors working with the Independent Welding Distributors Cooperative, hopes to break ground in the next month, President Ned Pontious said in an interview.

The project comes in response to a growing trend of consolidation in the liquid gas market, Pontious said.

“We want to provide gases for our five members, for their current usage and future usage, and we want to remain independent,” Pontious said. “There’s been a lot of rollups and acquisitions in this business in the past 20 years, and these five companies have all been in business for roughly 70 years. They’re family-owned businesses, and they want to remain family-owned businesses.”

Absolute first publicized the project on Dec. 14, ahead of Airgas’ Dec. 20 announcement. Beating both to the punch was Allentown, Pennsylvania-based Air Products, which said Dec. 12 it would build a “large-scale facility” in the Twin Cities. All three plants are expected to begin operations in 2020.

“Air Products has supplied customers in Minnesota and the surrounding region with both onsite gases and merchant liquid for decades,” said Francesco Maione, Air Products regional vice president, in a statement. “This investment shows further commitment to our customers in the Midwest region, will expand our ability to serve the greater area, and will provide reliable product to supply new customers as well.”

Air Products did not disclose the location or cost of its planned facility. The company could not be reached for comment.

According to Faribault city documents, the Absolute Air project is in a business park just off Interstate 35 on the north side of town, and will hire about five employees starting out. The site will be dominated by a 170-foot cooling tower, just five feet shorter than the tallest stack at the Minnesota Municipal Power Agency power plant across the road.

The member businesses – Mississippi Welders Supply, Toll Company, Minneapolis Oxygen, A-OX Welding Supply and Huber Supply – will transport the processed gas to a combined 30 business locations across seven states, Pontius said.

That’s still a tiny footprint compared to Air Products, with more than 750 production facilities across 50 companies, or Airgas, the U.S. subsidiary of French multinational Air Liquide. But Pontious said growing demand for liquid gas products, and growing frustration among some customers with the major players in the industry, leaves space for Absolute Air and its member companies.

“We’re not building as big a plant as Air Liquide, and we don’t expect we’ll be competing with them day-in and day-out on some of these large accounts, but we’ll now have production to compete in a mid-market area,” Pontius said.

The move will quadruple the company’s retail hydrogen sale capacities for individual FCEV customers.

The additional capital came from Mitsui Group’s U.S. based subsidiary Hy Solution and Air Liquide, each adding $12 million to the pot. FirstElement will now use the money to grow their capacity from the current 7,000 fuel cell electric vehicle capacity to be able to serve more than 28,000 vehicles.

California Energy Commission vice chair Janea Scott has big hopes for the growth of electric and hydrogen infrastructure in the state of California: “Private investments such as those announced today, represent a tremendous opportunity to accelerate California’s transition to a zero-emission transportation market, which in turn helps the state meet its air quality standards and achieve its climate change goals.”

FirstElement’s CEO Jiel Ewanick went a step further, citing the international partners involved in the project, which could potentially serve as a pilot project in future: “American, Japanese, and French companies are coming together to invest in a retail hydrogen network that is the first of its kind anywhere in the world. This shows the critical role that California is playing in a global energy transformation, and it’s based on a business case that allows us to expand and drive down the price of hydrogen fuel, all with a road to profitability and sustainability.”

Japan: Taking a Lead in Hydrogen - Features - The Chemical Engineer,"Mon, 01 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNoZW1pY2FsZW5naW5lZXIuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVzL2phcGFuLXRha2luZy1hLWxlYWQtaW4taHlkcm9nZW4v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Japan has identified hydrogen as the answer to the energy problem, both for transportation and in power generation.

IF YOU think the energy situation in the UK looks challenging, just consider that of Japan. With double the population (126m vs 65m) crammed into brightly-lit, air-conditioned mega-cities, plus a vast manufacturing base to feed, total energy consumption is the world’s fifth largest. But Japan’s domestic natural resources (coal, oil, gas) are practically non-existent.

From the 1960s onwards, Japan bet large on nuclear, constructing over 50 reactors. Its first plant at Tokai was, in fact, supplied by Britain’s GEC. Then, in 2011, disaster struck as a massive tsunami overwhelmed the Fukushima Daiichi facility. With public confidence shattered, the entire atomic fleet was shut down. Whilst some plants are slowly returning to service following work to bolster their safety cases, energy-hungry Japan remains the world’s largest LNG importer and the third largest coal importer.

With a change of direction essential, Japan has identified hydrogen as the answer, both for transportation and in power generation. Via the 3E+S (Energy Security, Economic Efficiency, Environment + Safety) principles enshrined in its 2014 Strategic Energy Plan, Japan intends to showcase hydrogen at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Some 40,000 hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) and 160 filling stations are to be ready for the Games, leading to 800,000 by 2030. As we’re about to see, Japan’s plans are certainly ambitious – and not without challenges.

Japan’s massive car industry is getting on-board with its ‘big three’ (Toyota, Nissan, Honda) teaming up with Air Liquide to boost the national re-fuelling network. And, having pioneered the Prius petrol-hybrid in the 90s, Toyota recently launched the Mirai (see Figures 1 and 2), the world’s first purpose-built hydrogen fuel cell vehicle. Its hydrogen-fed fuel cell can even power homes, potentially a life-saver in an earthquake-prone nation.

Fuel cell vs electric

But whilst economies-of-scale might address the Mirai’s £60,000 price-tag, some warn of Japan creating unique ‘Galapagos’ solutions which cannot readily be marketed globally. By constrast, North America is pursuing more of an ‘electrify everything’ philosophy as exemplified by Elon Musk. Tesla’s billionaire founder has slammed fuel cell vehicles as “really dumb”, betting instead on an electric vehicle (EV) and domestic battery storage combination. And with limited take-up of ‘hydrogen highways’ to date, Europe also broadly favours the electrical route for transportation.

The fuel cell vs electric argument is not clear-cut, however. Electric vehicle proponents note that using renewables-sourced electricity to directly charge up a battery-electric vehicle is much more efficient (73%) than using the same power to generate hydrogen to feed a fuel cell vehicle (22%). Others counter that this may not provide the full picture: hydrogen could be produced from surplus ‘green’ power generated at effectively zero marginal cost. And that electricity distribution infrastructure (designed around relatively low mean demand) may struggle as electric vehicle charging demand ramps up. According to a German study, the overall cost of switching 20m vehicles to fuel cells would be cheaper than for electric vehicles. The study goes on to show, as we’ll see below, that these two so-called rivals might instead complement each other with fuel cell vehicles used by larger, centralised users, and electric vehicles preferred by private motorists.

Sourcing hydrogen

Returning to Japan, the issue of where to source hydrogen is also proving contentious. Last year, The Chemical Engineer reported that Kawasaki Heavy Industries and the Australian Government entered into a pilot-plant partnership to begin converting Australia's Latrobe Valley’s vast lignite reserves. Whilst a scaled-up development would include carbon capture and storage (CCS), environmentalists have lambasted it as yet another coal-based development. Furthermore, they note that upon arrival in Japan, the hydrogen could be bled into the supply to existing thermal power stations, thus prolonging the nation’s dependence on imported fossil fuels.

That said, with storage and distribution infrastructure established, alternative hydrogen sources, including local renewables, could follow. Plans are already underway in the Fukushima prefecture to construct an 11.3 MWe solar-powered plant to generate hydrogen via electrolysis. But just to prove there are no perfect solutions, elsewhere in densely-packed Japan, concerns have been raised about the destruction of forests to make room for solar farms. Meanwhile, developments in floating offshore wind and tidal energy could prove key in the deep and stormy waters surrounding Japan.

What lessons can be learned?

So, what might the UK learn from Japan’s early lead in hydrogen? Whilst technology learnings are always there to be shared, the deployment may be very different. In the UK, the renewables sector is well-established and growing further; some of this green electricity could be converted into green hydrogen. This could then be used in power generation to smooth out the intermittent output from offshore wind.

Or it might be used a substitute for (or a diluent to) natural gas for our heating needs as per the H21 concept. By contrast, the typical Japanese home lacks central heating (at least as we understand it). And with parts of the UK North Sea oil & gas sector approaching decommissioning, redundant offshore infrastructure could be re-purposed for hydrogen production and storage.

And in transportation, we might see hydrogen best deployed as a substitute for large-scale diesel users: imagine the improvement in urban air quality of switching commuter trains, buses, delivery vans and taxis over to hydrogen. And as those major users can be re-fuelled from centralised hubs, the need for widespread new infrastructure can be much reduced, especially if the UK public plumps for EVs for its personal transport.

There’s no doubting the scale of Japan’s hydrogen vision and its determination to deliver on it. And whilst much of this makes sense in the context of the nation’s unique energy challenges, the hydrogen roll-out won’t be quick or cheap. Few other places may choose to embrace hydrogen as widely but there are sure to be valuable lessons to be learned from the Japanese.

More hydrogen filling stations to be installed in Flanders - The Brussels Times,"Fri, 19 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJydXNzZWxzdGltZXMuY29tLzU1Njc5L3RocmVlLW1vcmUtaHlkcm9nZW4tZmlsbGluZy1zdGF0aW9ucy1pbi1mbGFuZGVycy1wdWJsaWMtZmlsbGluZy16b25lcy1ldXJvcGUtYmVuZWx1eNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By 2020, Flanders will have at least three more public hydrogen filling stations. The roll-out of hydrogen filling stations must go hand in hand with the roll-out of hydrogen vehicles. These vehicles can also benefit from tax exemption and a purchase premium in Flanders.

“The new hydrogen stations are being prepared within the European projects H2 Benelux and Hydrogen Region 2.0,"" said Lydia Peeters, Flemish Minister for Energy (Open Vld).

At present, there are only two hydrogen filling stations. One in Zaventem (Air Liquide) and one in Halle (Colruyt). Flemish public transport company De Lijn also has one in Antwerp for its five hydrogen buses.

23 hydrogen vehicles

In 2018 there were only 23 hydrogen vehicles in Belgium. In 2018, about 43,000 'green vehicles' were registered in Flanders, of which 25,376 hybrids, 9,644 CNG cars and 7,911 were battery-powered electric cars.

Flanders supports the roll-out of hydrogen filling stations. ""Companies can get support, a so-called Ecology Premium+."" In addition, co-financing of 20% of the investment costs is possible within the European project BENEFIC.

However, no Flemish hydrogen projects were submitted in the two calls for projects.

New super radars on French roads.

Currently, there are already several devices in operation (in Marseille, Strasbourg and Yvelines department, among others).

The new devices will replace the speed cameras demolished during the protests of “yellow vests”. They have many features and incredible range. Super radars called Mesta Fusion 2 are placed on poles about 4 meters high, so that they can “observe” traffic better. They cover as many as 8 road lanes within a radius of up to 200 m, so they monitor dozens of vehicles at the same time (32 – according to rtl.fr portal). They are equipped with high-resolution cameras (36 megapixels).

In addition to detecting vehicles driving too fast, the devices have many other functions. They register vehicles passing through a red traffic light, drivers using a phone behind the wheel, or unfastened seatbelts. For the time being, however, the equipment will catch only road hogs. Importantly, radars equally monitor all vehicles, from motorcycles to cars and trucks.

Emmanuel Barbe, inter-ministerial delegate for road safety, in a statement for largus.fr pointed out, however, that all these radars will not be active at the same time. Most of them are supposed to give drivers a fright – at their sight, the drivers will slow down.

Cryogenics offer alternative freezing solutions - FOOD Magazine - Australia,"Wed, 17 Apr 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiI2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2RtYWcuY29tLmF1LzcyNTk5LTIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When thinking of cryogenics, most people think of the science fiction fantasy whereby billionaires freeze their decaying bodies in liquid nitrogen in the hope that technology will catch up and allow them to live forever.

In real life, cryogenics has many, less dramatic purposes, albeit important ones – including the freezing of foodstuffs.

There are two standard methods of freezing foods at an industrial scale. One is mechanical, and the other is the aforementioned cryogenics.

The mechanical method involves using a chemical refrigerant such as CFCs or ammonia, which is used in a closed cycle. The system moves large volumes of air to freeze the product. It cools the air like a refrigerator, but, is of an industrial size with a bit more grunt in its engine.

A cryogenic system is different. It uses liquid nitrogen or liquid carbon dioxide to freeze the product. It has direct contact with the product either as droplets of liquid nitrogen, or solid particles of carbon dioxide (dry ice)because carbon dioxide cannot exist as a liquid at atmospheric pressure.

Air Liquide is one company that specialises in cryogenic freezing and is at the forefront of a technology that has been around for more than 50 years.

The company’s senior international expert in food processing, Aron Segal, knows that cryogenics is a niche market, but an important one. There are benefits and issues with both mechanical and cryogenic freezing. However, cryogenics is not utilised as much as it should be, especially for those people that don’t have a massive amount of money to invest in capital.

“When it comes to mechanical freezing, the operating costs are strictly dependant on the price of electricity,” said Segal. “But, you have a high capital investment for the equipment. There is little operation flexibility with the mechanical freezing system because you basically set your set points in the freezer and so you have very little movement of that temperature.”

It also takes a longer time to install a mechanical freezer system than a cryogenic one. There is a lot of maintenance required to keep the mechanical system in good working order.

“Against that, you have cryogenic freezing, which requires a lower initial investment because the equipment is smaller, it operates colder and can be rented,” said Segal. “There’s very low maintenance and no compressors. There is just injecting a fluid into a freezer and then exhausting the gas.”

Cryogenics is also very fast freezing because products are frozen at a set point, such as -60, -80, -100 or -120˚C. It is rare for a mechanical freezer to operate below -40. And because cryogenic freezing is faster, it requires far less floor space because you are moving product through quicker. Then there is the science behind this type of freezing system.

“You get quality product because the faster you freeze something the smaller the ice crystal size,” said Segal. “The larger the crystal size, the more likely the product is going to thaw out not looking exactly like it did when you froze it, which when it comes to vegetables and fruits, can be a problem.”

Then there is moisture loss, which can be a big issue when manufacturers are selling product by weight and they lose four or five percent of that product’s weight in the freezing process. It’s a big cost to the bottom line. Because cryogenics is faster, there is less loss.

Segal said that cryogenics are also ideal for those that are just starting out a business mainly because of the aforementioned lower capital outlay as well as a lack of space. Not only that, but if the business is volatile, a company could be left to the whims of its clients’ fickleness.

“If you have invested in a mechanical system and you lose an important customer in two or three years, you’re stuck with that plant,” he said. “If you opt for cryogenics, with the correctly sized cryogenics freezer, it takes up far less floor space and you can install it overnight. You can press the button the next day. And if you lose the market, you’re not stuck with high-end capital equipment.”

Segal also said that cryogenics is capable of targeting specific aspects of a product, which again, is another feature it has over its main rival in the space.

“We’ve developed a range of equipment to do other things, not just simply freezing produce. We can crust freeze and crust harden,” he said. “Let’s say your end product is sliced ham. You have these large portions you want hardened a bit to make it easier to slice. With cryogenics you can get a firm outer surface that you don’t get with mechanical freezing because it will take a long time. Therefore, you’ll get more efficient slicing and far

less wastage. The slices can fall nicely on the conveyor where they can go into a qualified atmosphere packaging system.

“Another example is if you’ve got small particulate products like pizza toppings. To freeze them mechanically would be difficult. You’d probably have to do it in bags because you probably wouldn’t like it on a conveyor belt. Cryogenics has systems that can handle particulates so they don’t come out in a frozen clump. They come out free flowing.”

Segal gives another example of where cryogenic freezing would be ideal – desserts. A manufacturer can harden the main part of the product in the cryogenic tunnel – not fully freeze it, but partially freeze it. Then they can put a topping on it and put it through again and freeze the topping without intermingling with the lower component. This is especially important when different components of a product have different freezing points, or react in different ways to certain temperatures. Segal said that it is part of Air Liquide’s brief to work with clients on how cryogenic freezing can help them make sure their business reaches its potential while guaranteeing safe operations.

“Niche products are where we find our current market,” he said. “When people are trying to create these products, it is cryogenics that helps them. It’s not just about putting products in and freezing them, there is the value-added aspect. When we identify enquiries, we have to understand exactly what our client is expecting from the freezing process. We know very quickly whether cryogenics is going to be a process that supports their cost structure, and how suitable it is for their business or not.”"
