These electrolyzer projects, which will each have a capacity of 200 MW, will significantly contribute to the decarbonization of the Dutch and neighboring countries‚Äô industry and support the growth of clean mobility markets.

Both electrolyzers will run on renewable electricity. The two projects will produce a total of around 30,000 tonnes of renewable hydrogen per year without generating any CO2 emissions. Compared to a traditional process, this will avoid the emission of more than 5 million tonnes of CO2 over the period of operation. The ELYgator project will be located in Terneuzen, the Netherlands. The CurtHyl project will be located at the Maasvlakte 2 conversion park in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Those two world scale electrolyzers will be integrated into the existing Air Liquide portfolio of assets and enable the supply of low-carbon hydrogen to multiple customers of the industry and the mobility markets.

Pioneering projects such as ELYgator and CurtHyl contribute to the national and European climate ambitions as hydrogen will play a key role in decarbonization, particularly for hard-to-abate industry and mobility sectors. The grant award is a major step towards the final investment decision, with both projects subject to regulatory approvals.

Pascal Vinet, Senior Vice President and a member of Air Liquide‚Äôs Executive Committee, supervising notably Europe Industries activities, said:

Air Liquide is very pleased with the Dutch authorities‚Äô recognition of the uniqueness of its two renewable hydrogen flagship projects in the Netherlands. The Group remains more than ever committed to making low-carbon hydrogen a driving force of the energy transition, as part of our strategic plan, ADVANCE.

The industrial gas company Air Liquide has completed the construction of a hydrogen pipeline to the ThyssenKrupp plant in Duisburg. CHEManager reports about it.

The approximately 4 km long pipeline connects the steel plant in Duisburg with Air Liquide‚Äôs hydrogen network in the Ruhr region. The line is part of the H2Stahl laboratory sponsored by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection.

‚ÄúBy connecting our facility to Air Liquide‚Äôs hydrogen pipeline, we are creating the conditions for environmentally safe steel production,‚Äù commented Bernhard Osburg, CEO of ThyssenKrupp Steel.

Air Liquide‚Äôs 200-kilometer hydrogen pipeline network in the Rhine and Ruhr region connects hydrogen production facilities with major customers in Marl, Oberhausen, Duisburg, D√ºsseldorf and other cities.

In autumn 2023, the Trailblazer in Oberhausen is to become the first industrial water electrolysis plant with a capacity of 20 MW to be connected to Air Liquide‚Äôs H2 network. At the first stage, it will make it possible to supply customers with up to 2,900 tons of hydrogen per year through the pipeline.

The steel mill in Duisburg plays a leading role in the decarbonization of steel production. Back in 2019, ThyssenKrupp and Air Liquide first tested blast furnace hydrogen technology to reduce CO 2 emissions, then the project was supported by the government of North Rhine-Westphalia. Further test expansion was put on hold due to high natural gas and electricity prices, but plans remain to build a direct iron recovery test facility.

As GMK Center reported earlier, the Australian mining company Fortescue Metals signed the agreement with the Japanese Mitsubishi Corp. and European steel producer Voestalpine for the creation of an industrial prototype plant for the production of direct reduction iron (DRI). The DRI production process using hydrogen and electric steel melting furnaces at the Voestalpine site in Austria will be based on Primetals Technologies solutions."

Materials supplier Airgas held a grand opening Monday for its new Henderson distribution facility, after relocating from its previous facility in Southern California.

The company, owned by Air Liquide, supplies speciality gasses such as liquid hydrogen and protective equipment to businesses in fields such as medical, food processing, metalworking and manufacturing. It also operates retail locations across the country, including four in Southern Nevada, selling gas, welding and industrial equipment as well as PPE and safety supplies.

‚ÄúHenderson offered the ideal combination of reach, real estate, and workforce,‚Äù Jay Worley, chief operating officer at Airgas, said. ‚ÄúWe can reach our customers and our branches in the western United States here very effectively. The available property is very attractive, and the workforce that we‚Äôre already finding out is encouraging. It‚Äôs an engaged group of people.‚Äù

Construction on the 224,000-square-foot distribution center was completed in August, with products arriving at the facility in September and shipping out in October, according to a news release. Airgas CEO Marcelo Fioranelli said during Monday‚Äôs grand opening that the distribution center can accommodate over 19,000 items related to medical, industrial and welding safety products as well as specialty gasses.

The company moved its location from Whittier, California to Henderson this past year.

Worley said it‚Äôs the sixth regional distribution center for Airgas, and it will serve as the main facility for the company‚Äôs operations in western states. It also helps the firm achieve its goal of being able to ship products to 95 percent of the U.S. population within two days, according to Worley.

Henderson Mayor Debra March said she thinks the city was chosen by Airgas because of its ‚Äúcentral location,‚Äù since the city is about five hours away from the Port of Long Beach in Long Beach, California and road access to other states is easily accessible.

But it wasn‚Äôt just those factors that enticed Airgas to Henderson. The company received $362,882 in tax incentives from the Governor‚Äôs Office of Economic Development in March. Worley said the tax abatement ‚Äúdid play a factor‚Äù in the company relocating its distribution center to Henderson.

In return for the abatements, Airgas was required to hire 55 workers in two years. So far, Airgas is keeping those promises. Worley said the company has invested $7 million into its Henderson facility. It currently employs 55 people but expects to grow its staff count to 66 by next year.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre already approaching that (threshold) now,‚Äù Worley said. ‚ÄúBusiness is good and I think the opportunities that are going to exist here are likely to surpass our initial projections.‚Äù

March, who also serves as the chair of the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada, thinks having a facility like the one from Airgas benefits Southern Nevada.

‚ÄúA distribution facility like this allows for us to reach the western states with the important resources like hydrogen for transportation or the liquid gasses that hospitals require,‚Äù she said.

The Henderson distribution facility is the newest one for Airgas, and the design is focused on filling online orders because of e-commerce‚Äôs rise during the pandemic, according to Worley. He also noted there is still ‚Äúspace to grow‚Äù at its Henderson location.

In total, Airgas has 1,400 locations with nearly 18,000 employees, and in Nevada it has 11 locations with 143 employees across the state, according to the company.

The funding is earmarked for the construction of shared CO2 transport and export facilities on the Antwerp port platform. The grant award is a major step towards the final investment decision, expected in 2023.

The project, named ‚ÄúAntwerp@C CO2 Export Hub‚Äù, is set up as an open-access infrastructure to transport, liquefy and load CO2 onto ships for onward permanent offshore storage. CO2 captured on industrial players sites on the Antwerp port platform will be collected and transported via an intra-port open-access pipeline network. A shared liquefaction and export terminal will be built, including a CO2 liquefaction unit, buffer storages and marine loading facilities for cross-border shipping. This innovative project will be among the first and largest multimodal open access CO2 export facilities in the world.

Export terminal

As part of the project, Air Liquide and Fluxys intend to form a joint venture for the construction and operation of the CO2 liquefaction and export terminal. The joint venture will benefit from Air Liquide‚Äôs expertise in CO2 liquefaction and handling and from Fluxys‚Äô experience in terminalling activities. Air Liquide will provide its proprietary technology for the CO2 liquefaction plant, which will be a first of a kind in its scale and design. The Port of Antwerp-Bruges reserved a plot of land for the terminal on a strategic location inside the port, and will build new quay infrastructures for the mooring of CO2 ships.

First phase of Antwerp@C

The project is the first phase of Antwerp@C, an initiative gathering Air Liquide, BASF, Borealis, ExxonMobil, INEOS, TotalEnergies, Fluxys and Port of Antwerp-Bruges with the ambition to halve the CO2 emissions in the Antwerp port area by 2030. In this first phase, Air Liquide and BASF will be the launching customers of the export hub through their joint CO2 capture and storage (CCS) project ‚ÄúKairos@C‚Äù[1]. The Antwerp@C CO2 Export Hub will have an initial export capacity of 2.5 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa), with the ambition to reach up to 10 Mtpa by 2030. It will pave the way for future CCS initiatives in the region by providing scalable and modular infrastructures accessible to all industrial players.

Pascal Vinet, Senior Vice President and a member of Air Liquide‚Äôs Executive Committee, supervising notably Europe Industries activities, said:

We are very pleased that the Antwerp@C CO2 Export Hub project, supported by innovative Air Liquide technologies, has been selected by the Connecting Europe Facility for Energy program. Alongside the use of renewable energy, carbon capture technology is essential to achieve in a short time frame massive CO2 reductions and carbon neutrality objectives namely for hard-to-abate sectors. This initiative illustrates Air Liquide‚Äôs expertise and ambition to actively contribute to the emergence of a low-carbon society and to support its industrial customers in their decarbonization strategies.

Pascal De Buck, CEO Fluxys, said:

We are delighted to launch this CO2 infrastructure project with Air Liquide and Port of Antwerp-Bruges. Together with our partners, we offer strong and complementary know-how and expertise for providing reliable and efficient decarbonisation solutions, essential for achieving climate change objectives and ensuring the long-term viability of the economy. Antwerp@C CO2 Export Hub is an integral part of the full-scale Fluxys CO2 approach, offering emitters in the Port of Antwerp-Bruges, in Belgium and beyond, the opportunity to convey their captured CO2 through a backbone.

Jacques Vandermeiren, CEO Port of Antwerp-Bruges, said:

Port of Antwerp-Bruges has been committed from the very start in the Antwerp@C project in order to reduce the CO2 emissions on the Antwerp port platform by 50% in 2030. The fact that we have been awarded this CEF-E subsidy today, which means we can now start building a joint CO2 infrastructure, makes us particularly proud. It strengthens us in our conviction that as a port authority we must continue to fully assume our role as community builder in order to achieve a climate impact that reaches far beyond the boundaries of the port platform.

TOTALENERGIES and Air Liquide have partnered to produce and valorise renewable, low-carbon hydrogen, to contribute to greener aviation.

The partnership is part of the energy company‚Äôs commitment to transform its Grandpuits-Bailly-Carrois refinery in France‚Äôs Ile-de-France region, into a zero-crude platform by 2024.

As part of the agreement, Air Liquide will invest more than ‚Ç¨130m (US$136.4m) to construct and operate a 20,000 t/y hydrogen unit, that will produce partly renewable hydrogen, generated using residual biogas from a planned TotalEnergies‚Äô biorefinery in place of natural gas.

Under the partners‚Äô long-term agreement, TotalEnergies commits to purchasing the hydrogen to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). It intends to build a 400,000 t/y biorefinery at its Grandpuits platform which will primarily serve aviation, producing 170,000 t/y of SAF. The hydrogen could also be used to support sustainable mobility in the Ile-de-France region.

The hydrogen unit will be delivered alongside Air Liquide‚Äôs Cryocap carbon capture technology, which will reduce the Grandpuit platform‚Äôs carbon footprint by 110,000 t/y. The captured CO2 can then be used for food and industrial applications. Cryocap enables cold capture of CO2 released during hydrogen production via a cryogenic process, which after purification can be used to meet a variety of industrial needs for carbonic gas supply.

The partners expect that their sustainable circular approaches, which are in line with their shared 2050 net zero ambitions, will prevent 150,000 t/y of emissions compared to current processes."

"Quality, reliability and innovation ‚Äî the winning formula - Manufactures Monthly","Tue, 13 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbm1vbnRobHkuY29tLmF1L3F1YWxpdHktcmVsaWFiaWxpdHktaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi13aW5uaW5nLWZvcm11bGEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide delivers innovative gas solutions and technologies to manufacturers around the Globe. Manufacturers‚Äô Monthly explores how the industrial gas experts are helping a highly regarded Australian fabricator continue to grow.

Celebrating its 50th year, Rockpress ‚Äì Rocklea Pressed Metal ‚Äì has a reputation for custom-made fabricating work, either for one-off projects or higher volume demand. After years of development, the company owns six buildings at its facility in Queensland, with more than 13,000 sqm of factory floor space and over 100 staff.

Allan Mortensen, assistant manager, explained Rockpress‚Äô journey over the years, including a vision to continue to expand its manufacturing capability. Having been with the company for 33 years, Mortensen said the expertise in-house is a key reason for the company‚Äôs success.

‚ÄúOur key staff ‚Äì from our General Manager, Estimators, Designers, through to our workshop team ‚Äì are all trade qualified. That means every person involved in your project will understand its unique requirements in detail,‚Äù he said.

Rockpress is not an OEM, rather focusing on making to-order, custom builds. Having the quality assured stamp of approval across manufacturing (ISO 9001), workplace health and safety (ISO 45001), and environmental (ISO 14001) work practices, the company is able to serve the semi-trailer industry efficiently.

Its workshop capacity and engineering scope means the company enters a range of other industries, including heavy transport, mining, food and beverage, medical and pharmaceutical, electrical engineering, Defence and architectural.

Among its capabilities, Rockpress provides an end-to-end service with design aid, metal fabrication, welding, CNC Machining and Milling and surface finishing.

‚ÄúWe start in shed 37 with laser cutting and bending,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt then moves into whatever fabrication section is required ‚Äì sheet metal, heavy fabrication and machining are all in separate sheds. Once it‚Äôs been manufactured and processed through those sections, it‚Äôll then move down to our coating section in most cases. In our coating segments, we have garnet blasting, powder coating and wet spraying.

‚ÄúOnce the design has been finalised, Rockpress will review the criteria and specifications to get the best results for the project, including the most cost- effective approach. It is an extremely organised company.‚Äù

This organisation leads to excellence and needs to be reflected in the critical supply of gas for different manufacturing operations. Air Liquide has recently partnered with Rockpress, installing a number of vessels at its expansive site.

Reliable supply leading to further efficiencies

Air Liquide supplies industrial products in both gaseous and liquefied volumes for medium to large customers. Air Liquide manufactures Oxygen, Nitrogen, Argon, Carbon Dioxide and many other products in large-scale production facilities throughout Australia and delivers them to customers.

Their expertise extends to the installation, maintenance and monitoring of liquefied gas storage systems. Offering safe and reliable supply systems in a range of sizes and flow capacities to meet the needs of many industries.

With quality and reliability being key considerations, Rockpress wanted to improve their gas supply to keep up with continued growth, and Mortensen said Air Liquide is well and truly meeting this challenge.

‚ÄúEverything they say they will do, they do. It‚Äôs been a very positive start with Air Liquide,‚Äù he noted. ‚ÄúOne of our main problems in the past has been running out of gas, specifically nitrogen, for our lasers. Onsite, we mix our own gas for welding, which is part of what Air Liquide provides us.‚Äù

Reliability of supply is critical in a manufacturing environment, considering the disastrous impacts downtime can have on capital. Behind the innovation in which Air Liquide prides itself on, is a strong backbone of technical support and innovation. To sit customer-side,

the company has an experienced team of operators and can leverage off its global network to solve any more advanced problems.

‚ÄúWhat we were looking for above all is service,‚Äù Mortensen explained.

‚ÄúIf anything breaks down, we need reactions. We‚Äôve got four lasers, which cost us around $8 every minute they aren‚Äôt operating.‚Äù

Earlier this year, at Rockpress‚Äô facility, Air Liquide installed:

Two vertical (15,000L and 10,000L) high pressure Nitrogen vessels that supplies LASAL Nitrogen to Multiple Lasers.

One vertical (2,500L) Oxygen vessel that supplies FLAMAL Oxygen for plasma cutting.

One vertical (5,000L) Argon vessel & three (176L) Carbon Dioxide vessels with three gas mixers for welding. The gas mixes supplied are ARCAL 8, ARCAL SPEED, ARCAL PRIME & ARCAL FORCE.

LASAL for laser cutting

The LASALTM range is full range of lasing gases with the industry‚Äôs highest purity standards for every laser resonator. The choice of lasing gas directly determines the reliability of the laser, lifespan of the optics and output power.

Thanks to its research and development prowessin Japan, France and around the world, Air Liquide has pioneered the laser industry standard for effective and consistent control of impurities.

FLAMAL for plasma cutting

FLAMALTM is Air Liquide‚Äôs brand of specialised gases used for oxy-fuel applications including cutting and heating. The stable, propylene high energy fuel gas, is a cutting-edge alternative to acetylene, propane, blended fuels and natural gas.

When used for cutting, brazing, metalising and heating applications, FLAMAL combines the best performance characteristics of acetylene with the safety of propane to produce better results.

ARCAL for welding

Air Liquide‚Äôs, ARCALTM brand is its dedicated welding gas range. With five ready-to-weld argon mixture solutions that cover virtually all welding application needs. Each mixture was designed to be reliable and simple, yet high-performing. Air Liquide also have a range of Technical mixtures for those unique applications.

Air Liquide‚Äôs telemetry system

All bulk vessels installed at the Rockpress facility are linked to Air Liquide‚Äôs telemetry system, which provides visibility and forecasting of their usage. The telemetric control system monitors the level of residual product in the storage vessel, in a round-the-clock regime, and automatically transfers data to Air Liquide servers.

The information collected from the telemetry systems provides real-time analytics on current product levels and consumption rates which assist in scheduling and ensuring a sustained supply at all times.

For Rockpress, this kind of reliability is integral to its plans of further expansion.

‚ÄúWe want to expand and with that expansion we embrace the new technology with the supply of gas,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking for someone we can partner with that can supply us with the most up to date technology. This is why we made the move to Air Liquide.‚Äù

Working towards a sustainable future

‚ÄúADVANCE‚Äù, Air Liquide‚Äôs new strategic plan for 2025, is a milestone in the company‚Äôs history. It places sustainable development at the heart of the Group‚Äôs strategy and is built around four pillars;

1. Delivering strong financial performance

Uniper and Shell's Humber hydrogen plan moves forward with contract awards - Business Live,"Tue, 13 Dec 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzLWxpdmUuY28udWsvZWNvbm9taWMtZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQvdW5pcGVyLXNoZWxscy1odW1iZXItaHlkcm9nZW4tcGxhbi0yNTczODQ4OdIBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzLWxpdmUuY28udWsvZWNvbm9taWMtZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQvdW5pcGVyLXNoZWxscy1odW1iZXItaHlkcm9nZW4tcGxhbi0yNTczODQ4OS5hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sign up to FREE email alerts from BusinessLive - National - our round-up of the headlines that matter every morning

Three companies have been awarded contracts to design a hydrogen production and carbon capture plant for Uniper and Shell on the South Humber Bank.

Air Liquide Engineering & Construction, Shell Catalysts & Technologies and Technip Energies will compete to deliver the Humber H2ub proposal, and take it to the front-end engineering and design phase and potentially through to operation.

The step will be welcomed by industry, coming almost three months after Uniper was nationalised by the German government as a stabilisation measure over the energy crisis caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. At the time, while it said there were no plans to sell, no update was given on the investment proposals at Killingholme Power Station, first revealed in April.

Humber H2ub forms part of Uniper‚Äôs Energy Transformation Hub Killingholme, with plans for a separate green hydrogen project - using renewable energy as a feedstock - also progressing.

This phase would see low carbon fuel produced using gas reformation, with 720 megawatts eyed - enough to heat half a million homes. Use will be industry-focused though, with the Humber‚Äôs process and power plants switching while transport is another route. Around 1.6 million tonnes of carbon would also be captured annually, with Uniper part of the Zero Carbon Humber proposal.

Guy Phillips, Uniper‚Äôs senior business development manager for hydrogen, said: ‚ÄúThe award of process design package contracts represents a significant step towards our plans for low-carbon hydrogen production at Killingholme. This will help to decarbonise the UK‚Äôs largest CO2 emitting industrial region. Hydrogen will be one of the solutions to achieve the UK‚Äôs target of becoming carbon neutral by 2050, and the Humber region and this project will contribute to achieving it.‚Äù

A final investment decision is anticipated in the mid-2020s. It is one of several hydrogen production projects being brought forward as part of a ¬£15 billion decarbonisation drive on the Energy Estuary - currently one of the worst polluting regions in Europe.

Paul Black, Shell‚Äôs business development manager for upstream, integrated gas and new energies, said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never been more important to explore new ways to use the UK‚Äôs natural gas together with carbon capture technology. And we are making strong progress with Uniper to do this. We aim to build hydrogen production to boost the country‚Äôs long-term energy security and decarbonise heavy industry, transport and power in the Humber region. This forms part of Shell‚Äôs broader intent to build a global leading hydrogen business, which has included work starting in 2022 to build Europe‚Äôs largest renewable hydrogen plant in the Netherlands.‚Äù

The three companies were chosen through a formal selection process which began last year. Seven contractors were asked to propose solutions for a final bid, with costs, preliminary designs and bid concepts submitted. On the Humber Air Liquide and Technip are both involved with Velocys‚Äô sustainable aviation fuel projects - given a major funding boost this week - with Shell Catalysts working on both Phillips 66 and VPI Immingham ‚Äôs Humber Zero carbon capture plans, the latter also with Technip. Technip is also part of the design competition for H2H Saltend - one of the first to emerge.
