Air Liquide to reach 70% renewable energy sourcing in Benelux with new large PPA - Air Liquide,"Tue, 24 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5haXJsaXF1aWRlLmNvbS9ncm91cC9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy1uZXdzLzIwMjMtMTAtMjQvYWlyLWxpcXVpZGUtcmVhY2gtNzAtcmVuZXdhYmxlLWVuZXJneS1zb3VyY2luZy1iZW5lbHV4LW5ldy1sYXJnZS1wcGHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide and Vattenfall, one of Europe’s leading producers and retailers of electricity, signed a new Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for 115 MW of renewable installed power capacity. This second PPA of such scale in Benelux, significantly expands Air Liquide’s overall renewable power supply in the region. It reaffirms Air Liquide's commitment to lead the way in decarbonizing the European industry while lowering its own carbon footprint, in line with its Sustainable Development objectives.

Contracted over a 15-year period beginning in 2026, the PPA will bring overall renewable power capacity available to Air Liquide to around 270 MW in Benelux. This capacity will provide energy representing more than 70% of the Group's existing electricity consumption in Benelux. The new renewable energy will be generated by the Hollandse Kust Zuid (HKZ) subsidy-free, worldscale offshore wind farm by Vattenfall off the Dutch coast.

This PPA will support Air Liquide’s decarbonization of its industrial and medical activities in the region, and enable the Group’s customers to reduce the carbon content of their end products to foster a low-carbon economy in Europe. In all, the PPAs signed in the region will enable Air Liquide to reduce emissions related to power production of up to 8.5 million tonnes of CO2 over the duration of the contracts, which is comparable to the emissions generated by over 350,000 Dutch households.

Delaware hydrogen hub wins $750M fed grant - Delaware Business Times,"Fri, 13 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vZGVsYXdhcmVidXNpbmVzc3RpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2RlbGF3YXJlLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLWh1Yi13aW4v0gFFaHR0cHM6Ly9kZWxhd2FyZWJ1c2luZXNzdGltZXMuY29tL25ld3MvZGVsYXdhcmUtaHlkcm9nZW4taHViLXdpbi9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NEWARK – A coalition of states including Delaware has won $750 million in the federal H2Hubs grant program to support research, production and distribution of clean hydrogen gas, potentially supporting tens of thousands of jobs.

The selection, set to be highlighted by President Joe Biden at a press conference in Philadelphia on Friday, marks a significant boost to the mid-Atlantic region’s work on clean hydrogen, including a number of Delaware companies and sites.

Researchers have increasingly come to believe that hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe, could be a carbon-free fuel source of the future, powering commercial vehicles, ships and planes without harming the environment. For that to happen, however, the production of hydrogen through the splitting of water molecules in a process known as electrolysis would need to become more efficient, and a nationwide distribution network would need to be established.

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has set a “hydrogen shot” goal of lowering clean hydrogen cost by 80% to $1 per 1 kilogram in one decade. To advance toward that goal, the Biden administration dedicated up to $7 billion toward the H2Hubs program for the development of regional clean hydrogen hubs, where industry and research universities would expand work on clean hydrogen fuel.

Among the authors of the H2Hubs program was U.S. Sen. Tom Carper, who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. He told Delaware Business Times that he was extremely bullish on the value of hydrogen as a renewable energy source.

“These hydrogen hubs are our future – not just for our economy, but for our planet,” he said, noting that greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change is worsening the heat waves, wildfires, floods and more that have plagued the country this year. “Is this crisis real? Yes, it is. And I think that even among my Republican friends in the Senate, I think they’ve come to believe that it’s real.”

Nationwide, many regions and states banded together to increase their odds of being chosen as one of up to 10 hub sites. Delaware joined with southeastern Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey to form the Mid-Atlantic Clean Hydrogen Hub (MACH2), a nonprofit entity that will receive and distribute funding.

The DOE reportedly received about 80 concept papers for hubs around the country. After a review, MACH2 was one of just 33 chosen to submit a full application and one of seven selected for funding.

“This is a big deal. Hydrogen is a clean fuel of the future, one of the ways we can pollute less. Our region has been chosen for a federal infusion of hundreds of millions of dollars that will create thousands of jobs and show how hydrogen can be made, transported and used in a real-world way,” Gov. John Carney said in a statement announcing the selection. “Delaware companies and institutions have already led on hydrogen and now will play a big role in the Mid-Atlantic Clean Hydrogen Hub. When we have talked about the opportunities for Delaware from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law championed by President Biden and our congressional delegation, this has been one of the big ones and we got it. I’m looking forward to getting to work with our partners in the region.”

The $750 million grant is about 17% smaller than the $900 million for which the coalition applied, but represents an enormous investment into advancing the work in the region. The hub includes 24 partners to date, including private companies, public entities including transit departments and airports, and labor unions, that would invest upward of $2 billion in the project too.

The funding could potentially support 20,000 jobs in the region, according to congressional officials, and all MACH2 projects will be constructed with project labor agreements – MACH2 was scored as the most union-supportive hub applications. All clean hydrogen production will come from renewable energy, nuclear energy, and capturing wastewater emissions, with no fossil fuel extraction, according to the coalition.

“Today is a monumental day for Delaware and its role in the future of our nation’s clean energy economy. Delaware possesses the resources, infrastructure, and workforce that make it an ideal location for one of the country’s first hydrogen hubs, and I’m glad the Department of Energy has recognized these strengths by selecting the Mid-Atlantic Clean Hydrogen Hub,” said Sen. Chris Coons, who has lobbied the U.S. Department of Energy about Delaware’s strengths in the hydrogen industry. “MACH2 will create a new generation of good-paying jobs for Delawareans, support new industries that can work hand-in-hand with our universities and leading businesses, and ensure that the First State plays a leading role in reducing our nation’s carbon footprint. I am proud to have advocated tirelessly for this proposal and can’t wait to see these projects come to fruition.”

Delaware has been helping build the region’s case for landing the funding for more than a year, hosting Labor and Energy Cabinet secretaries at a summit here last summer and launching the Center for Clean Hydrogen, backed by the University of Delaware and Chemours, among others.

Companies like Air Liquide, PBF Energy and Bloom Energy have been working on hydrogen production and storage while W. L. Gore & Associates, Chemours, DuPont, and Versogen have been working on membranes that are integral to electrolysis. Others like Compact Membrane Systems have been working on carbon capture that could help transition from natural gas-powered electrolysis to renewable energy sources.

Dora Cheatham, executive director of the Delaware Sustainable Chemistry Alliance, helped to write the MACH2 proposal and said she was “absolutely thrilled” to find out that it had been selected for funding, noting it was much smaller than other competing proposals.

One of the biggest advantages that MACH2 had in the federal competition is one of its oldest: a decades-old pipeline infrastructure built for now defunct petroleum plants that could be converted into a “hydrogen highway.”

The Delaware City Refinery owned and operated by New Jersey-based PBF Energy will figure prominently into the MACH2 plans. The company aims to create a plant in Delaware City capable of producing upward of 137 megatons of clean hydrogen a day, according to the MACH2 concept proposal.

Initial projections are that 85 tons of clean hydrogen could be produced and used by companies and entities in the mid-Atlantic region in the early stage of development, which can replace an equivalent amount of daily natural gas combustion. It could reach over 600 tons per day once fully scaled up.

Some of that production would likely go to help support the adoption of hydrogen fuel by long-haul truckers, an industry that could benefit from the fast-fueling, long-lasting energy. Air Liquide, a French chemical company that has its U.S. Innovation Center in Glasgow, is exploring the buildout of eight fueling stations along the Interstate 95 corridor that could help create an environment here that currently only exists in California.

Cheatham said that PBF and Chesapeake Utilities would be involved with the production of hydrogen in Delaware and that public transit entity DART Transit, chemical manufacturer Croda and the DuPont Experimental Station had all expressed an interest in using the gas for energy.

The federal funding is not guaranteed, as MACH2 organizers must now develop a 10-year plan for how they aim to disseminate the funding for the federal government. It will reportedly be doled out over four phases, with ground being broken for new production plants in the second phase."
These 4 Measures Indicate That L'Air Liquide (EPA:AI) Is Using Debt Reasonably Well - Simply Wall St,"Thu, 19 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3NpbXBseXdhbGwuc3Qvc3RvY2tzL2ZyL21hdGVyaWFscy9lcGEtYWkvbGFpci1saXF1aWRlLXNoYXJlcy9uZXdzL3RoZXNlLTQtbWVhc3VyZXMtaW5kaWNhdGUtdGhhdC1sYWlyLWxpcXVpZGUtZXBhYWktaXMtdXNpbmctZC0y0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. As with many other companies L'Air Liquide S.A. ( ) makes use of debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?

What Risk Does Debt Bring?

Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together.

What Is L'Air Liquide's Net Debt?

You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that L'Air Liquide had €12.3b of debt in June 2023, down from €13.5b, one year before. On the flip side, it has €1.71b in cash leading to net debt of about €10.6b.

How Healthy Is L'Air Liquide's Balance Sheet?

According to the last reported balance sheet, L'Air Liquide had liabilities of €9.84b due within 12 months, and liabilities of €14.7b due beyond 12 months. On the other hand, it had cash of €1.71b and €3.04b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities total €19.8b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.

While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since L'Air Liquide has a huge market capitalization of €82.2b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. But it's clear that we should definitely closely examine whether it can manage its debt without dilution.

In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.

L'Air Liquide's net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 1.5 suggests only moderate use of debt. And its commanding EBIT of 16.1 times its interest expense, implies the debt load is as light as a peacock feather. And we also note warmly that L'Air Liquide grew its EBIT by 14% last year, making its debt load easier to handle. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine L'Air Liquide's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free .

But our final consideration is also important, because a company cannot pay debt with paper profits; it needs cold hard cash. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, L'Air Liquide recorded free cash flow worth 64% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.

Our View

L'Air Liquide's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And the good news does not stop there, as its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow also supports that impression! When we consider the range of factors above, it looks like L'Air Liquide is pretty sensible with its use of debt. That means they are taking on a bit more risk, in the hope of boosting shareholder returns. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted you should know about.

If, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out without delay.

"Billion-dollar Backlogs Get Bigger for Linde, Air Liquide - Yahoo Finance","Fri, 27 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9iaWxsaW9uLWRvbGxhci1iYWNrbG9ncy1iaWdnZXItbGluZGUtMTIzMDAwODcwLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Despite rising interest rates, higher power costs in the U.S. and global economic uncertainty, two of the world’s top industrial gases companies, which include hydrogen production among their specialties, reported a growing backlog of projects as the clean energy movement continues.

U.K.-based Linde said Oct. 26 its backlog increased by $300 million to $8.1 billion during third quarter 2023. The backlog includes $4.5 billion in sale of gas projects, or investments supported by long-term supply agreements.

“We do not put MOUs and LOIs into the backlog. A backlog is only recognized when we have a signed contract in place with guaranteed cash flows for the future contracted in,” Linde CEO Sanjiv Lamba said. Linde expects to see 1%-3% of earnings per share (EPS) growth coming from its backlog.

A day earlier, Paris-headquartered Air Liquide said its investment backlog—defined as the cumulated industrial investment value of projects decided but not yet started— hit a record high of $4.2 billion euros (U.S.$4.4 billion), up from $3.4 billion euros in third-quarter 2022. It is considering spending about 3.4 billion euros in the next 12 months with more than 40% of the projects linked to the energy transition.

“For every project that we are building, we have a strong signed contact with a known customer. We are not building and [waiting] for the market to come,” Air Liquide CEO Francois Jackow said on a call with analysts. “We are in an inflationary environment, so we have strengthened both our terms and conditions with the customer and especially to make sure that systematically we include an index on the capex during the construction phase,” something that wasn’t necessary for the industry in the past.

The healthy backlogs are expected to help maintain growth for both companies as each look to take on more hydrogen projects in the U.S. where efforts are underway to develop regional hydrogen hubs. Hydrogen, which has near-zero greenhouse-gas emissions, is seen as a solution to climate woes, serving as a route to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors and reduce reliance on fossil fuels used in transportation.

Story continues

Getting bigger, risks remain

Air Liquide is a partner in six of the seven projects recently selected for negotiations by the U.S. Department of Energy to receive a share of $7 billion to establish hydrogen hubs.

“Clearly the main driver here is to really accelerate commercial deployment of hydrogen in use for mobility and use for decarbonizing industry and even for power generation,” said Mike Graff, executive vice president for Air Liquide.

He added that the company has the technologies necessary to deliver in various markets—be it renewable power for mobility or utilization of autothermal reforming technology with its Cryocap for carbon capture technology.

“In addition to that, we’ve got infrastructure associated with a lot of these key hubs that allow us to play within all of the aspects of those markets and … for every type of technology that I mentioned, we can already point to something that’s in operation at a commercial scale,” he added.

Industrial gas giant Linde is also in on the U.S. hydrogen hub action, including as a partner for the California’s Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems (ARCHES) hub. Liquide and Air Products are also among the hub’s partners.

“How we think about our business and also the development of the business going forward is all built around network density, and that’s the acid test that we apply to the development around the hydrogen hubs as well,” Lamba said on the Oct. 26Linde’s earnings call.

Growing backlogs, however, don’t come without risks.

A Barclays analyst on the call, inquiring about Linde’s risk appetite, pointed out some pullback in the clean energy space, caused perhaps by “a bit more economic rationality in some green ambitions.”

Lamba acknowledged risk in the market and reiterated the company’s view.

“We’ve always maintained that technology and scale up, resulting in projects that have a competitive position, are the ones that are going to move forward,” Lamba said. “And I want to reiterate today that we are seeing many of those projects that we’re currently developing on track for exactly those reasons.”

Linde remains confident about the $50 billion-plus worth of global investment opportunities in hydrogen over the next decade. However, Lamba also remains skeptic regarding the availability of renewable energy needed for electrolysis to produce green hydrogen.

“Obviously, technology and scale up on green is also lacking today,” he said, adding green energy projects will likely be available at scale at cost-competitive levels about a decade from now.

Earnings results

Linde again raised its annual earnings guidance this week, bolstered by the global clean energy push that includes investments in hydrogen.

“Clean energy projects continue to progress well as our customers remain committed to decarbonizing their assets,” Lamba said.

The company said it expects EPS to increase 14% to 15%, compared to last year, to between $14 and $14.10. Linde, which unveiled a $15 billion share buyback plan earlier this week, plans to spend about $3.5 billion to $4 billion this year.

The company reported adjusted EPS increased 17% to $3.63 for the third quarter, though total sales dropped 7% to $8.2 billion.

“Capex of $950 million increased 24% from last year, primarily due to project capex spending in support of the $4.5 billion sale of gas backlog,” Linde CFO Matt White said. “As a reminder, the Linde definition of project backlog is unique and the most stringent in the industry. Inclusion requires assured growth, a customer contract with fixed fees and explicit termination provisions to ensure investment returns. Furthermore, this $600 million of base capex includes $320 million of additional growth investments to increase network density.”

Network density, as Lamba later explained, involves leveraging all product economics in a small targeted area where it has customers. It’s something the company intends to build on with its acquisition in January 2023 of nexAir LLC, a U.S.-based independent packaged gas distributor that wants to expand further in southeast U.S.

About 40% of Linde’s project backlog is clean energy and nearly 70% of the projects are located in the Americas. The company committed to grow EPS by at least 10% this year. It expects the growing project backlog to contribute between 1% to 3% of EPS growth, while pricing and productivity is expected to account for between 4% and 6%."

Air Liquide establishes new low-carbon gas production platform in Québec's new energy transition valley - Air Liquide,"Tue, 24 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3d3dy5haXJsaXF1aWRlLmNvbS9ncm91cC9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy1uZXdzLzIwMjMtMTAtMjQvYWlyLWxpcXVpZGUtZXN0YWJsaXNoZXMtbmV3LWxvdy1jYXJib24tZ2FzLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tcGxhdGZvcm0tcXVlYmVjcy1uZXctZW5lcmd5LXRyYW5zaXRpb24tdmFsbGV50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Through an investment of more than 140 million euros (more than 200 million Canadian dollars), Air Liquide announces that it will establish in Bécancour, Québec (Canada), a breakthrough platform supplying low-carbon industrial gases including hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and argon. In addition to the Group’s 20 MW PEM electrolyzer, currently the world’s largest in operation, the infrastructure created by Air Liquide will include a new air separation unit producing renewable oxygen and nitrogen, as well as liquid storage capacity, connected by a local pipeline network to best serve its customers. This Air Liquide low-carbon production platform, in line with the industrial and port zone's drive to decarbonize, makes Bécancour a unique place for the Group to produce renewable industrial gases and develop offers for customers engaged in the energy transition.

Air Liquide will build, own and operate a production and distribution infrastructure, including a new air separation unit (ASU) producing oxygen, nitrogen and argon; as well as a liquid storage capacity. The new ASU will be powered by renewable energy from hydropower sources, in line with Air Liquide's ADVANCE plan to reduce its CO2 emissions by 33% by 2035. Adding a total oxygen production capacity of 850 tonnes per day, the new infrastructure will primarily supply customers manufacturing battery components for electric vehicles via long term contracts and should be operational in 2025.

The project will also connect its Bécancour PEM electrolyzer, enabling the recovery and valorization of renewable oxygen from the hydrogen production. Leveraging its production platform in the Bécancour port and industrial park, the Group will be able to offer a sustainable, reliable and competitive solution to its customers today and to meet additional market demand tomorrow.

As part of Québec's development as an energy transition hub, this new investment will support growth in the electric vehicle battery sector, contributing to the decarbonization of mobility. It will initially supply battery component manufacturers, including Ecopro CAM Canada (EcoProBM + Ford + SKO), and will have the capacity to supply others in the Bécancour area as well as bulk clients in Eastern Canada.

11 winners from the US' $7B investment in 'clean hydrogen' - Canary Media,"Wed, 18 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbmFyeW1lZGlhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9oeWRyb2dlbi8xMS13aW5uZXJzLWZyb20tdGhlLXVzLTdiLWludmVzdG1lbnQtaW4tY2xlYW4taHlkcm9nZW7SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Department of Energy laid down its bets Friday in the first phase of its effort to instigate an American clean-hydrogen economy. The agency selected seven regional winners of a collective $7 billion in funding allocated by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to get a series of ​“hydrogen hubs” up and running. Now negotiations will begin to finalize the proposals.

The DOE, following the requirements in the law, spread out the hubs geographically and technologically, investing in different sources and uses for clean hydrogen. To qualify, each hub had to convincingly demonstrate that it could ​“produce at least 50–100 metric tons of clean hydrogen per day and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.” The diversified approach broadens the toolkit and gives more communities a reason to get excited about a potential hydrogen economy, though it has also elicited criticism from climate advocates for its support of hydrogen derived from methane with carbon capture.

As demonstrated by the fanfare surrounding the program’s presidential rollout, the big bucks at play and the potential to help decarbonize everything from steelmaking to aviation, the hydrogen hubs are set to become one of the biggest storylines in the U.S. clean energy transition. So it’s a fitting time to get familiar with the entities best positioned to shape — and benefit from — the emerging low-carbon hydrogen economy.

The total tally of organizations is far too extensive to relay here — just the California hub’s list of 400 participants stretches about as long as that state’s scenic coastline. But a handful of companies appear in two or more regional hydrogen hubs; this list includes oil and gas majors, clean electricity producers, cleantech startups and at least one major corporate customer. One player in particular gets around: Legacy industrial hydrogen supplier Air Liquide showed up on the dance cards at six of the seven winning hubs, which seems to be the record.

Here’s a handy alphabetical guide to the most active participants named in the DOE’s chosen hydrogen hubs (with hubs listed in parentheses).

AES Corporation (California, Gulf Coast)

This independent power producer took a decisive strategic turn toward clean energy in recent years, shutting down coal plants and building renewables and batteries. Now it stands to supply the renewable power needed to run electrolysis for green-hydrogen production. AES previously stated it would build a $4 billion renewables-powered hydrogen facility northwest of Dallas along with legacy producer Air Products. They’re aiming to bring it online by 2027, turning 1.4 gigawatts of renewable generation into 200 metric tons per day of green hydrogen, far bigger than anything like it in the U.S. today, and a step toward the DOE’s goal of producing 10 million metric tons of clean hydrogen annually by 2030.

Air Liquide (Appalachia, California, Gulf Coast, mid-Atlantic, PNW )

It might not be a household name, but 120-year-old French company Air Liquide is a central figure in the legacy hydrogen industry, which has focused almost entirely on the carbon-emitting steam methane reformation process. But Air Liquide has taken steps to keep up with the green-hydrogen revolution; in 2021, it opened a facility housing 20 megawatts of electrolyzers in Quebec powered by local hydropower, which ranked as the largest green-hydrogen production in the world way back then. The company operates extensively in the Gulf Coast petrochemical corridor, and it already stores hydrogen in an underground cavern in Beaumont, Texas that holds a month’s worth of backup for its pipeline. But the geographical spread of the hub appearances shows that Air Liquide won’t be pigeonholed in any one region.

Amazon (California, PNW )

The online retailer and web services giant invested early in hydrogen to power forklifts at its warehouses; it found the liquid fuel performed better than batteries for running emissions-free indoor vehicles. As of 2022, Amazon was running 15,000 forklifts at 70 fulfillment centers on green hydrogen with help from partner Plug Power, while scoping out the fuel for decarbonizing its delivery fleet. Both the California and the Pacific Northwest hubs aim to remake the West Coast heavy-duty trucking network in a cleaner, hydrogen-powered image. Amazon has explicitly said it is testing hydrogen trucks for shipping and fuel cells for powering its buildings, and it wants to use its bulk purchasing power to expand the market for cleanly produced hydrogen. Now it will have a chance to make good on those aspirations."

Outlook supported by record investment decisions

Commenting on sales in the third quarter of 2023, François Jackow, Chief Executive Oﬃcer of the Air Liquide Group, stated:

“Air Liquide achieved a solid performance in the third quarter, highlighting the resilience of its diversified business model and its ability to prepare for future growth in a challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. The Group’s performance this quarter was characterized by growth of its activity on a comparable basis and a record level of investment decisions. In line with its ADVANCE strategic plan, the Group continued its actions to steadily improve operating performance, in particular to generate efficiencies. Revenue reached 6.81 billion euros, an increase of +1.5% on a comparable basis in the third quarter. On a published basis, it stood at -17.4%, mainly due to the drop in energy prices (whose variations are contractually passed through to Large Industries customers) as well as negative currency impacts. The Gas & Services activity, which represented 95% of the Group’s revenue, was up +1.7% on a comparable basis. Industrial Merchant and Healthcare were the growth drivers of this activity. Constantly improving its operating performance, the Group has notably generated significant efficiencies of 320 million euros over nine months, which represents an increase of +22%, despite an inflationary environment unfavorable to cost savings on purchases. It also continued the dynamic management of its business portfolio, while its ability to create value enabled it to adjust its prices in Industrial Merchant. Cash ﬂow[1] grew by +8.6% excluding the currency impact. The Group’s investment momentum was particularly strong, reflecting its commitment to climate and paving the way for future growth. The project backlog, at 4.2 billion euros, and investment decisions, at 1.3 billion euros this quarter, reached record levels. With more than 40% of projects linked to the energy transition, 12-month investment opportunities are also numerous and total 3.4 billion euros. In 2023, Air Liquide is confident in its ability to further increase its operating margin and to deliver recurring net profit growth, at constant exchange rates[2].”

As far as biofuels are concerned, there will be limited availability of biomass to meet the growing needs of the different sectors, including mobility. As for e-fuels, their composition requires large quantities of hydrogen and involves interaction with carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), the origin of which will also be scrutinized. Ultimately, the scarcity of one and the cost of the other means that these alternatives are best suited to long-haul flights, while renewable hydrogen is best suited to short and medium-haul flights.

These solutions are complementary, and whatever happens, the energy transition will involve massive investment for the sector."
We need green hydrogen to clean up heavy industry. Who's making it? - Canary Media,"Thu, 26 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbmFyeW1lZGlhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9oeWRyb2dlbi93ZS1uZWVkLWdyZWVuLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLXRvLWNsZWFuLXVwLWhlYXZ5LWluZHVzdHJ5LXdob3MtbWFraW5nLWl00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"You can’t build something out of nothing, and this immutable fact poses a challenge for the essential heavy industries whose decarbonization plans depend on cleanly produced hydrogen.

The steel industry is betting on clean hydrogen to replace coal in the making of its key input, iron. Fertilizer suppliers want to replace fossil gas with hydrogen as the feedstock for synthesizing ammonia. Cement manufacturers hope to rely on hydrogen as a clean heat source. Chemical refineries already use fossil-derived hydrogen and need to clean it up to make their operations compatible with a livable planet.

As detailed in Canary Media’s The Tough Stuff series, the current best bets to decarbonize the building blocks of modern society depend on a steady supply of clean hydrogen readily accessible to industrial centers around the country. This simply does not exist today in the U.S.; in other countries, it’s only happening on a small scale.

“The projects in service now [globally] — we’re talking 10 megawatts, 20 megawatts,” said Claire Behar, chief commercial officer at an integrated green-hydrogen venture called Hy Stor. ​“We need to be breaking ground today with these gigawatt-scale projects in order to even come close to meeting our climate goals.”

The success of the industrial decarbonization project, then, requires not just reorienting massive incumbent industries around novel low-carbon processes, but simultaneously inventing a whole new clean-hydrogen supply chain capable of feeding these enormous beasts.

Hydrogen itself is not difficult to make. It’s already produced at scale using steam methane reforming, a highly carbon-emitting process. People have synthesized it without fossil fuels for over a century as a byproduct of the chlor-alkali process, used to make chlorine gas. Hydrogen can also be produced more directly through electrolysis, which involves running an electric current through water.

For hydrogen to be green, though, the electricity tapped for either of those last two processes needs to be verifiably carbon-free. Gold-standard green hydrogen would plug off-grid renewables straight into electrolyzers. If a producer runs electrolyzers from the grid and buys credits for renewable power equal to consumption, that process can actually emit more carbon than dirty methane-based production; this counterintuitive fact animates the debate on whether federal tax credits should require ​“time-matching” renewable generation with hydrogen production.

Other techniques can be clean without being ​“green.” Nuclear-powered electrolysis is not renewable but is carbon-free. Methane reforming that effectively catches its emissions forever technically could be carbon-free, though this remains to be proven both practically and financially.

Even if the industry were to embrace the highest standard of green hydrogen, there are plenty of hurdles to overcome. The vital hydrogen electrolyzer equipment itself is still maturing; it needs to improve in efficiency, production scale and cost, just like solar panels and batteries needed to a decade ago. And nobody has much experience hooking electrolyzers up into large-scale hydrogen production sites — the equivalent of turning a pile of solar panels into a functioning power plant.

To make green steel, cement and chemicals, then, the U.S. needs to figure out how to super-size carbon-free hydrogen production, posthaste. Several groups are already vying for position in this emerging, not-yet-extant market. Their plans will take U.S. green hydrogen production from zero to something in the coming year.

Legacy industrial gas providers — Air Liquide, Air Products, Linde, Messer — are scoping out green-hydrogen facilities to complement their existing carbon-based operations. Separately, cleantech innovators are applying lessons from the solar boom to green-hydrogen project development, in some cases bundling electrolyzers and clean electricity generation at the same site. Legacy oil and gas majors are talking about leveraging their immense engineering capabilities to produce hydrogen while capturing emissions from dirty methane-based processes.

Congress greased the wheels by passing the most enticing green-hydrogen production tax credits ever in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. If the unexpectedly public jockeying over the fine print on those tax credits is any indication, a lot of well-resourced corporations are itching to jump into the fray and collect those benefits. And earlier this month, President Biden announced the much-anticipated winners of $7 billion for seven regional hydrogen hubs, intended to jump-start the U.S. hydrogen economy by creating supply and demand in close proximity.

In other words, a hazy American green-hydrogen economy is starting to come into view. Here’s the uncertain path from the state of play today to a future with enough green hydrogen to clean up steel, cement and more.

Tending the green shoots of green hydrogen

I spent weeks asking leading figures in the emerging green hydrogen industry where commercial-scale production is currently taking place in the U.S. The consensus was that it doesn’t exist — yet.

Some green-hydrogen production can be found nearby, though, at a hydro-powered facility in Bécancour, Quebec, owned by legacy industrial gas supplier Air Liquide. The plant debuted in 2021 as the largest green-hydrogen producer in the world: It contains all of 20 megawatts of proton exchange membrane electrolyzers supplied by Cummins. There are several different ways to produce clean hydrogen, but that type — PEM for short — has the most commercial momentum right now.

Hydrogen operatives quantify production capacity by how much electricity the electrolyzers consume. The 20-megawatt Bécancour plant takes in that much hydropower from Quebec’s utility and pumps out 8 metric tons of hydrogen a day, which the company liquefies and ships to customers in the Eastern U.S. and Canada.

“It may be the largest [plant] operating today, but lots of bigger ones are coming,” said Dave Edwards, Air Liquide’s officially designated ​“advocate for hydrogen energy.”

A 20-megawatt solar plant, or a 20-megawatt grid battery, seemed large once. This facility will soon be outclassed by a wave of increasingly potent hydrogen factories, some of which are already under construction. But it offers a few insights about how hydrogen producers can grow their capacity.

According to Edwards, the key questions to ask when planning a hydrogen production site are, ​“What energy is available to produce the hydrogen, who are the offtakers, and what do they need?”

To ensure greenness, Air Liquide opted to locate the facility in Quebec’s famous hub of renewable hydropower. The gold standard for green hydrogen will always be producing the invisible gas straight from a dedicated carbon-free power source, one that ideally delivers 24/7, allowing maximum runtime for the facility. Hydropower can check all of these boxes, as can geothermal and nuclear. Producers banking on cheap wind and solar will need to figure out how to get the most out of that inexpensive but intermittent supply.

As for the offtakers, producing in Quebec allowed Air Liquide to market green hydrogen to customers on the East Coast. The company previously produced out west for the early hydrogen market in California, which threw generous subsidies at the fuel. But demand has finally emerged in the East, and it’s best to localize hydrogen distribution within 500 to 1,000 miles of customers, according to Edwards.

To be clear, nobody in North America is buying green hydrogen today for steel or cement manufacturing. Startups and incumbents in those industries still have to figure out how to make green steel at scale, secure buyers, and then prepare those techniques for mass investment. For now, the minimal demand for clean hydrogen comes from customers who can actually use it."

(NYSE: LXU) (“LSB”), and Houston-based Vopak Moda Houston LLC (“Vopak Moda”) have agreed to collaborate on the pre-FEED for the development of a large-scale, low-carbon ammonia production and export project on the Houston Ship Channel. If the development proceeds, the project’s first phase is targeted to produce more than 1.1 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of low-carbon ammonia by the end of 2027, with options for future expansions.

The parties completed a feasibility study on the project earlier this year and the preferred facility’s location on the Houston Ship Channel, the second largest petrochemical corridor in the world, leverages existing infrastructure assets. Vopak Moda has invested in storage and handling infrastructure for bulk liquid products and currently operates an ammonia terminal that includes storage tanks and a newbuild dock with multiple deep-water berths. The project also has access to utilities and would be near multiple pipelines that could supply raw materials like natural gas and water.

The project partners will bring complementary expertise to the production, operation, storage and export for the advancement of low-carbon ammonia production in the US:

Air Liquide and INPEX would collaborate on low-carbon hydrogen production. Air Liquide would supply its AutoThermal Reforming (ATR) technology, an ideal solution for large-scale hydrogen production projects, combined with its proprietary carbon capture technology. The combination of ATR technology with carbon capture aims to capture at least 95% of direct CO 2 emissions from hydrogen production with at least 1.6 MTPA CO2 captured and permanently sequestered from this project. Air Liquide would be responsible for onsite nitrogen and oxygen production, using its proprietary Air Separation Unit (ASU) technology.

LSB and INPEX would collaborate on low-carbon ammonia production. LSB would lead the selection of the ammonia loop technology provider, the pre-FEED, and the engineering, procurement and construction of the facility. LSB would also be responsible for the day-to-day operation of the ammonia loop.

INPEX and LSB would sell the low-carbon ammonia and finalize off-take agreements with the numerous parties that have expressed interest and could also further partner in the project. The majority of the product would be used for power generation in Asia with some volumes going to Europe and the US. INPEX, with stakes in both hydrogen and ammonia production, will likely be the largest investor in the overall project across the entire value chain, from production to export.

Vopak Moda currently operates ammonia storage and handling infrastructure from its Very Large Gas Carriers (VLGC)-capable deepwater berth which is located in the deepest part of the Houston Ship Channel. Vopak Moda will maintain its ownership of the existing infrastructure and plans to build additional storage capacity as required to handle the low-carbon ammonia production of the proposed new facility.

INPEX Representative Director, President & CEO Takayuki Ueda said, “As we approach the achievement of our net zero target by 2050, the unveiling of our low carbon ammonia project in Texas, USA, stands as a momentous testament to INPEX's strong commitment to environmental leadership.

Air Liquide is investing more than €140 million (more than 200 million Canadian dollars) to create an innovative platform for the production of low-carbon gases, including hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and argon, in Bécancour, Quebec (Canada). It will complement the world’s largest PEM electrolyser, on the same site.

This 20 MW PEM electrolyser is already up and running, producing massive quantities of green hydrogen. The infrastructure that Air Liquide is going to set up in Quebec will include a new air separation unit (ASU) producing renewable oxygen and nitrogen, as well as liquid storage capacity, connected by a local pipeline network. Paradoxically, the platform will primarily supply, under long-term contracts, customers* manufacturing battery components for electric vehicles. It should be operational in 2025.

It should be noted that Air Liquide also plans to connect its PEM electrolyser in Bécancour, enabling the recovery and valorisation of renewable oxygen from hydrogen production.

The platform will have the capacity to supply other customers near Bécancour as well as bulk clients in Eastern Canada. “Operating in Bécancour for more than 35 years, we are delighted to be able to support the development of a growing industry with a reliable and competitive low-carbon offer,” comments Matthieu Giard, CEO of the Americas Hub.

(Bloomberg) – Hydrogen projects involving Amazon.com Inc., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Air Products and Chemicals Inc. are among those receiving portions of $7 billion in U.S. funding meant to make the country a leader in the fuel.

President Joe Biden and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm are set to announce the seven projects — stretching from Pennsylvania to California — that have been selected as recipients of the government backing. The official announcement will be made at the Port of Philadelphia, which the administration said would use hydrogen from a hub proposed for portions of Pennsylvania, Delaware and New Jersey to fuel trucks and other heavy-duty equipment.

The Biden administration is throwing its weight behind hydrogen and the hubs — broad networks of hydrogen producers and consumers spanning multiple states — as part of its goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. While almost no hydrogen is currently produced in the U.S, that figure could increase to 10 million metric tons by 2030, according to an Energy Department report. The administration has started an effort to reduce costs — one of the biggest barriers to hydrogen’s widespread use — by 80% to $1 a kilogram by 2030.

The Pennsylvania hub where the announcement is being made will receive up to $750 million in funding and will use existing oil infrastructure to produce hydrogen from both renewable and nuclear energy, according to the White House. Project partners include refiner PBF Energy Inc. and Air Liquide SA.

Other winners include as much as $1.2 billion for a California-based project that will produce hydrogen exclusively from renewable energy and biomass and is aimed at decarbonizing public transportation, heavy-duty trucking and port operations. Project partners include Amazon and Air Products.

A hydrogen hub backed by Senator Joe Manchin spanning parts of West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania that is partnering with natural gas producer EQT Corp., is receiving up to $925 million and will produce hydrogen using natural gas with carbon capture, according to the White House.

A Gulf Coast hydrogen hub centered in Houston and backed by companies including Exxon and Chevron Corp. was awarded as much as $1.2 billion. A hub proposed by a coalition of Midwest states that would be partially powered by nuclear energy to provide hydrogen for uses including steel and glass production was awarded up to $1 billion. Project partners include utility Exelon Corp. and reactor operator Constellation Energy Corp.

The hydrogen hub awards, which were funded in 2021’s bipartisan infrastructure law, mark the culmination of a furious race between states. The Energy Department in January urged 33 projects to submit full applications, after receiving 79 proposals.

In addition, the Biden administration has announced plans to award $1 billion to stimulate demand for hydrogen to provide “market certainty” and ensure demand."

But hydrogen isn't the climate savior it's made out to be. Hydrogen is a dangerous distraction, and we should not fall for it.



Technological fixes to climate change are tempting, and the Biden administration has not resisted the lure of hydrogen: The Department of Energy recently announced a massive $7 billion buildout of seven hydrogen hubs nationwide, the first of several such investments.



Hydrogen is dangerous, partly because it distracts from the real climate solutions we so desperately need. The world's best climate scientists have been clear that to maintain a livable planet, we must phase out fossil fuels and transition to truly renewable energy now. Hydrogen hubs take us in the opposite direction by further embedding us in the fossil fuel economy.

Communities like mine understand all too well that these projects take a toll on our drinkable water, breathable air, bodies, and livelihoods.

A staggering 99% of hydrogen production relies on fossil fuels, primarily methane, or ""natural,"" gas. Notably, oil, gas, and petrochemical companies produce the lion's share of the U.S. hydrogen supply: approximately 10 million metric tons. Once produced, more than two-thirds of hydrogen is used for petroleum refining.

A cursory examination of the partners across all seven proposed hydrogen hubs reveals who actually stands to benefit from them. Key recipients of this first $7 billion of public money are oil, gas, and chemical corporations, including Exxon, Chevron, Dupont, and Air Products. Air Liquide, a French gas company, is a named partner in at least six of the seven hubs chosen for the next phase of public funding. Fossil fuel and petrochemical companies are pushing for this hydrogen buildout because it is their ticket to greenwash their products as 'climate solutions' on the public's dime.

Making hydrogen is highly energy intensive, whether using large quantities of renewable power to make 'green hydrogen' through electrolysis or pulling in large quantities of methane gas coupled with energy-intensive and unreliable carbon capture systems to produce ""blue hydrogen."" At least two of the seven hydrogen hubs are associated with blue hydrogen production, which scientists say ""may be worse than gas or coal.""

Hydrogen production is not only very energy intensive, it also requires considerable amounts of water, a resource that is becoming increasingly more precarious due to the climate crisis. Louisiana this year faced never-before-seen wildfire threats, predicted to continue, largely due to drought. California has had some of the worst wildfire seasons on record. Both states are targeted for the proposed hydrogen buildout.

Calls for ""hydrogen-ready"" infrastructure are code for doubling down on building new gas production and pipelines, with the vague hope that this infrastructure might one day carry hydrogen. This is the opposite of what we should do, which is to take urgent action to phase out fossil fuels and transition to renewable energy to avoid climate catastrophe.

Hydrogen projects, especially blue hydrogen, put communities in harm's way. To produce blue hydrogen, CO2 must be scrubbed and captured, a process whose effectiveness is questionable at best. This process requires the buildout of additional infrastructure, thousands of miles of new pipelines, and injection wells to store the CO2 underground. This means more hazardous air and water pollution in our communities. People living near this new infrastructure for hydrogen and CO2 stand to face additional risks like pipeline leaks and injection well failures, which can be catastrophic.

Confusingly, funding for these hydrogen hubs is partially allocated under the ""Justice40"" initiative, which aims to address decades of underinvestment in disadvantaged communities. Yet many communities targeted for the hydrogen buildout—the same low-income and/or Black, Brown, and Indigenous communities supposed to benefit from the administration's environmental justice promises—are organizing against proposed hydrogen projects, because of the dangers they present.

I have had to become an expert on climate solutions out of sheer necessity. I am the fifth generation of my family to call South Louisiana home, and the climate crisis is coming for us in Louisiana faster than anywhere else in the country. At the same time, we're a target for the nationwide buildout of hydrogen, carbon capture, and other technological false solutions to the climate crisis.

Communities like mine understand all too well that these projects take a toll on our drinkable water, breathable air, bodies, and livelihoods. The projects come with often elusive promises of jobs, but those poised to truly benefit from these projects are fossil fuel and chemical companies.

Impacted communities deserve better. They deserve to be at the table when it comes to finding solutions that work for people and the climate. Just as importantly, they deserve justice for the harms wrought upon them by the fossil fuel industry. We all deserve a livable, breathable, drinkable future. And that future is not found in a hydrogen hub.

Beyond the fossil fuel industry's expensive hydrogen distraction, there are community-centered solutions that provide jobs and improve lives without jeopardizing communities. There are safe, scalable, proven, and affordable solutions like solar and wind energy, energy efficiency, local and regenerative agriculture, and zero waste programs that empower communities and make the most of limited and dwindling resources.



We need to stop subsidizing the fossil fuel industry, stop harming communities with false hype for hydrogen, and direct funding to real solutions to the climate crisis.

We have no time to waste."

This project — if it moves forward to final investment decision and construction, with operations starting in 2027 — would be nearly as large as the 1.2 million tonnes-a-year Geismar complex planned by fertiliser giant Nutrien.

The $2bn Geismar project was shelved this summer due to rising costs and uncertainty around when demand would materialise, despite preliminary agreements to supply Asian fuel markets.

The Texas project’s consortium — Japanese oil and gas company Inpex (expected to be the largest investor), Houston-based terminal operator Vopak Moda, French industrial gases firm Air Liquide, and US agrichemicals producer LSB Industries — has placed similar bets on exporting the majority of ammonia volumes to Asia for use in power generation, albeit with some volumes going to Europe or used domestically.

“As we approach the achievement of our net zero target by 2050, the unveiling of our low carbon ammonia project in Texas, USA, stands as a momentous testament to Iinpex's strong commitment to environmental leadership,” the company’s CEO and president Takayuki Ueda claimed.

However, the use of ammonia in power generation, ie, co-firing with coal, is controversial, with some think-tanks arguing that this extends the lifetime of these dirty facilities with very little emissions reduction and high cost compared to rolling out wind and solar.

Article continues below the advert

Nonetheless, the consortium expects that the Texas project’s preferred location on the Houston Ship Channel, the second-largest petrochemical corridor in the world, would allow it to use existing infrastructure for these exports.

This would include assets owned by Vopak Moda — a joint venture between Dutch infrastructure multinational Vopak and Enbridge-owned Moda Midstream — such as ammonia terminal, bulk liquid products storage and handling facilities, and new-build dock with multiple deep-water berths.

Air Liquide is already tapped to supply autothermal reforming (ATR) units for the plant to produce hydrogen from fossil gas, albeit with 95% of direct CO2 emissions captured.

The consortium calculates that this would result in at least 1.6 million tonnes a year of CO 2 captured and permanently stored, although the exact method of sequestration has not been disclosed — potentially opening the door to carbon storage routes associated with increasing fossil fuel extraction.

Inpex and Air Liquide had previously worked together on a 700 tonnes-a-year pilot blue hydrogen and ammonia project in Niigata, Japan, which started construction this year. However, this plant’s CO 2 is set to be injected into a nearby depleted gas reservoir to test whether further fossil gas can be recovered.

CO 2 is also commonly injected into oilfields to increase production and extract oil that would have otherwise remained in the ground, in a process known as enhanced oil recovery.

Hydrogen Insight has reached out to confirm whether a method of carbon storage has been decided — and if not, whether the consortium would agree to enhanced oil recovery as an end-use of the CO 2 .

LSB, meanwhile, is set to collaborate with Inpex on design, procurement and operation of the Texas project’s ammonia synthesis loop, as well as setting up and finalising offtake agreements with parties that have already expressed interest."
Heavy industry turns to carbon capture to clean up its act - EURACTIV,"Sun, 29 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFjdGl2LmNvbS9zZWN0aW9uL2VuZXJneS1lbnZpcm9ubWVudC9uZXdzL2hlYXZ5LWluZHVzdHJ5LXR1cm5zLXRvLWNhcmJvbi1jYXB0dXJlLXRvLWNsZWFuLXVwLWl0cy1hY3Qv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For decades heavy industry around Dunkirk in northern France has belched out millions of tonnes of climate-heating gases. Now the area close to the Belgium border – one of Europe’s industrial powerhouses – wants to catch its pollution before it escapes.

With factories turning out steel, cement and fertilisers, the Dunkirk area produces more carbon dioxide (CO2) than any other industrial region in France.

In Rety, about an hour’s drive from the port city, a never-ending stream of lorries brings limestone to a plant run by Belgian giant Lhoist, the world leader in quicklime production.

The limestone is heated to more than 1,000 degrees Celsius for 24 hours in kilns 50 metres tall to produce the calcium oxide needed by the steel and paper pulp industries.

“We have the capacity to produce 700,000 tonnes of quicklime a year, so we emit about an equivalent amount of CO2,” said Yves Boraccino, the manager of the plant in Rety, where nearly every surface is coated in white dust from a nearby quarry.

Freezing the CO2

Two-thirds of that CO2 is belched out of the plant’s chimneys during the limestone calcination process.

The remainder comes from the fossil fuels used to fire up the kilns.

In 2025, the site hopes to start equipping itself with a new mini-factory to capture the CO2.

Carbon capture and storage will be pushed hard by industry at the UN COP28 climate talks in November as a way to slow the rise in the planet’s average temperature to around 1.5 degrees Celsius.

But there are still big questions over technologies that are in their infancy, and the world does not have much time.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) says that even if it works, carbon capture would have to be scaled up 100,000-fold by 2050 to hit net-zero targets.

Lhoist has turned to industrial gas giant Air Liquide for help to capture carbon emissions from its Rety plant.

They have developed a technology called CryoCap which will capture the gases and cool them down to -50C when CO2 turns to liquid, said Nicolas Droin of Air Liquide.

The CO2 will then be separated off and piped to a terminal in Dunkirk that will hold 1.5 million tonnes of the gas when it opens in 2028.

EU sets world’s first target for underground CO2 storage capacity The European Commission set out a target on Thursday (16 March) to enable 50 million tonnes of annual carbon dioxide injection capacity by 2030, a move that puts the oil and gas industry under pressure to deliver on a technology they have been peddling for years.

‘Industrial revolution’

The Lhoist site in Rety is not the only one in the area aiming to clean up its act.

A few kilometres away, a cement plant owned by Eqiom is also planning to sequester its carbon pollution and send it to Dunkirk.

“From there, it could be taken by ship to deep geological storage sites in the North Sea,” Boraccino said.

The whole project – estimated to cost €530 million, much of it with European Union funds – could, in the medium term, store up to four million tonnes of CO2 per year, according to Air Liquide and its partner, Dunkerque LNG.

That would enable steel giant ArcelorMittal, which is testing a different carbon capture procedure, to connect up to the terminal at some point in the future.

Patrice Vergriete, head of the urban Dunkirk authority, said the region is transforming itself through this low-carbon “industrial revolution”.

Carbon capture projects almost tripled globally in 2021 and have almost doubled again since then, according to the IEA.

But in a report in July it also warned against relying on technologies that are “expensive and unproven at scale”. So far, it said, only 5% of capture projects have got the green light from investors.

Instead the IEA insisted that the best solution is to reduce the amount of CO2 being generated in the first place.

Is 2023 the year when carbon capture and storage finally takes off? The European Commission has finally acknowledged the absence of carbon capture and storage (CCS) from its emissions-reduction strategy but much remains to be done, writes Chris Davies.

A Liquid Future Emerges For Green Hydrogen In Texas (Where Else?) - CleanTechnica,"Tue, 10 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vY2xlYW50ZWNobmljYS5jb20vMjAyMy8xMC8xMC9hLWxpcXVpZC1mdXR1cmUtZW1lcmdlcy1mb3ItZ3JlZW4taHlkcm9nZW4taW4tdGV4YXMtd2hlcmUtZWxzZS_SAWhodHRwczovL2NsZWFudGVjaG5pY2EuY29tLzIwMjMvMTAvMTAvYS1saXF1aWQtZnV0dXJlLWVtZXJnZXMtZm9yLWdyZWVuLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLWluLXRleGFzLXdoZXJlLWVsc2UvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sign up for daily news updates from CleanTechnica on email.

Hydrogen fuel cell stakeholders have been slow to crack the US market for passenger cars, to say the least. However, the heavy duty truck market is a different story altogether. In the latest development, the fuel cell truck maker Hyzon has successfully completed a test of supercooled, liquid H2 for long haul trucks in the punishing environment of a Texas summer. Green hydrogen could eventually be in the mix, too. After all, it’s Texas.

Liquid (Green) Hydrogen For Fuel Cell Trucks

Green hydrogen or not, fuel cell vehicles run on electric drive, just like their battery-powered cousins. Like battery vehicles, fuel cell vehicles also produce no airborne emissions at the tailpipe.

Unlike batteries, fuel cells do not load up on kilowatts before hitting the road. They generate electricity on-the-go, through a reaction between hydrogen gas and ambient oxygen. The only byproduct is water.

“Gas” is the key word. Storing hydrogen gas under high pressure on a moving vehicle is among the challenges confronting fuel cell fans. The cost of carbon fiber and other materials for the specialized high-pressure storage tanks is one factor keeping fuel cell vehicle costs high.

Various workarounds are emerging, including sponge-like materials for hydrogen storage. Liquefied hydrogen is another route, and that’s where Hyzon is focusing its attention.

Liquid Hydrogen Put To The Test In Texas

CleanTechnica is reaching out to Hyzon to see if they used fossil-sourced hydrogen for their Texas road test, or green hydrogen sourced from water with renewable energy. Either way, it looks like liquid hydrogen is in the company’s future for heavy duty long haul fuel cell trucks.

On August 30, Hyzon reported the results of the liquid hydrogen test run, and the company was very pleased with itself.

Hyzon partnered with the legacy US food distribution company Performance Food Group for the test, which consisted of a 16-hour continuous run covering more than 540 miles with outside temperatures soaring over the 100-degree Fahrenheit mark at times.

At first glance it may seem that a load of liquid hydrogen fuel would weigh more than hydrogen gas, but that is not so according to Hyzon Chief Executive Officer Parker Meeks.

“With increased range and no added weight in comparison to our gaseous hydrogen trucks, we believe this liquid hydrogen demo run has demonstrated potential viability for the future of liquid hydrogen in commercial trucking,” Meeks said in a press statement.

What About The Cost?

The 540-mile trip is just for starters. Meeks anticipates that a commercial version of the company’s 200-kilowatt fuel cell with liquid hydrogen could hit the road for a range of 650-800 miles between fill-ups, helping to meet the all important bar of parity with conventional diesel trucks.

Hyzon also anticipates that liquid hydrogen could beat hydrogen gas on cost at the filling station, with a savings of up to $5 per kilogram.

That probably depends on the filling station. California is currently the only US state with public hydrogen filling stations. Reports of price spikes at some public locations surfaced in September, with the retail cost surging to $36 per kilogram from a recent high of $30, far above the reported price of $13 in 2021.

Presumably, trucking companies with their own private fuel depots or other truck-centrick fueling platforms would have more control over hydrogen fuel costs. That remains to be seen. In the meantime, some fuel cell truck makers are providing free fuel credits to their customers, with the aim of supporting the market for rolling stock until new hydrogen technologies and economies of scale bring fuel costs down.

How Does It Work?

The idea of subbing in liquid hydrogen for the gaseous form seems to be catching on, and it’s a safe bet that other stakeholders have been eyeballing the Texas demonstration. As Hyzon explains, a deep freeze of -400 degrees Fahrenheit provides for a significant increase in energy density, which helps accounts for why the overall weight of the vehicle is not impacted.

Hyzon picked the company Chart Industries to help engineer the cold storage system, including delivery to the fuel cell at the necessary pressure.

“This is a meaningful accomplishment for the hydrogen ecosystem,” observes Chart CEO and President Jill Evanko. “Our investment in our unique cryogenic liquid hydrogen onboard tank and our liquid hydrogen test facility support progress in the hydrogen industry.”

Where Is All The Green Hydrogen?

That’s a good question. Green hydrogen currently accounts for a minuscule fraction — around 1% — of the global hydrogen market. However, it’s a new industry with plenty of room to grow, and Texas has emerged as one of those green hydrogen growth spots (see more Texas green H2 coverage here).

For their liquid hydrogen test, Hyzon partnered with the legacy US gas transportation and storage firm Certarus, which was acquired last spring by the diversified Canadian energy company Superior Plus. Certarus features renewable natural gas in its product line, and its website indicates that green hydrogen is among the rising alternatives.

The liquid hydrogen itself was provided by Air Liquide, a leading global hydrogen stakeholder that has begun transitioning into a more sustainable profile. As part of that effort, Air Liquide is co-leading the Texas-Louisiana HyVelocity Hub, one of several regional teams competing for a share of an $8 billion pot to establish a network of “clean” hydrogen hubs around the US. The initiative is spearheaded by the US Department of Energy with funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

That BIL funding is significant because the law stipulates that fossil-sourced hydrogen must feature in part of the overall program. HyVelocity is focusing its efforts in that direction, which is no surprise considering that Chevron is also helping to lead the venture. However, the diversified energy firm GTI Energy is also on board along with the leading wind developer Ørsted, indicating a strong stakeholder interest in green hydrogen as well.

At present, Air Liquide is hedging its green hydrogen ventures with natural gas. However, the local impacts of oils and gas drilling are piling up one after another along with the global impacts of the looming climate crisis. It’s difficult to see how fossil-sourced hydrogen can compete with green hydrogen over the long run, carbon capture or not.

In the meantime, last month Air Liquide announced that it has hooked up with Trillium Energy Solutions (an offshoot of the Love’s travel station conglomerate) on a hydrogen fueling station venture aimed specifically at the heavy duty truck market.

The initial goal of the partnership is a 150-ton per day supply of hydrogen and the capability of refueling more than 2,000 heavy-duty fuel cell trucks. Trillium may have a head start on the green hydrogen angle through its renewable natural gas portfolio, so stay tuned for more on that.

Where’s Congress?

Of course, no news about the energy transition would be complete without a mention of Republican leadership in Congress, or not as the case may be.

At a time when the global economic and military might of the US should be focused squarely on helping its allies — namely, Ukraine and Israel — the Republican-led House of Representatives has been focused squarely on undercutting the very American exceptionalism they purport to champion.

The spectacle of the Republican majority floundering about leaderless like so many flopping fish in suits is beyond belief. Really, who fires the Speaker of the House in the middle of their term? Nobody, ever, that’s who.

The Senate is no better. For example, now would be a good time for Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama to drop his hold on hundreds of military promotions. That’s just one example. If you can think of others, drop us a note in the comment thread.

Note: On September 26, Hyzon announced an agreement to a $25 million settlement in resolution of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

While Europe currently has around 1,600km of H 2 pipelines across the continent, with 570km operated by industrial gases firm Air Liquide in Belgium alone, the Dutch development is the first to be set out as a national hydrogen network, which will be operated by state-owned gas transmission system operator Gasunie.

The pipelines, on which Gasunie took a final investment decision (FID) to spend more than €100m on construction in June, will run from between the Port of Rotterdam’s Maasvlakte 2 development to the Pernis area of Rotterdam.

Pernis sites a number of petrochemical refineries including the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park, which is set to receive volumes of renewable hydrogen from the oil major’s 200MW Holland Hydrogen I project located in Maasvlakte 2 once it starts operations in 2025.

However, beyond transporting H 2 from port-side to industrial plants in the city, Gasunie plans to ultimately extend the hydrogen network to not only other clusters within the Netherlands, but into Germany and Belgium from 2030 onwards — although a timeline on when FID will be taken on the rest of this network has not been disclosed.

Germany and Belgium have both started to progress plans for their own national hydrogen networks, with the two countries pledging an H 2 pipeline connection between each other by 2028.

But while Belgium has approved €250m in public funding towards constructing these pipelines, Germany is still mulling exactly how the proposed 11,200km network will be financed.

While the Netherlands’ first stretch in Rotterdam will consist of new pipelines, the company has previously told Hydrogen Insight that 85% of the full hydrogen network will consist of repurposed gas pipelines, such as infrastructure from the Groningen gas field, which stopped extracting fossil gas at the beginning of this month.

Gasunie is also one of the co-developers of the open-access ACE Terminal at Maasvlakte 2, which aims to facilitate imports of green ammonia from early 2026."

Muscat – Oman’s global integrated energy group, OQ, along with its partners, is planning to conduct a joint study to pave the way for green hydrogen fueling stations in Duqm.

OQ has signed an agreement with the Ministry of Transport, Communications and Information Technology, Asyad Group, Oman Oil Marketing Company (OOMCO), and Air Liquide Group. The purpose of this agreement is to conduct a joint pilot project study on green hydrogen fueling stations in the Special Economic Zone at Duqm (SEZAD).

The agreement was signed by H E Khamis Mohammed al Shammakhi, Undersecretary of the Ministry of Transport, Communications and Information Technology for Transport, Najla Zuhair al Jamali, chief executive of alternative energy at OQ, Ahmed al Balushi, chief executive of asset management at Asyad Group, Tarik Mohammed al Junaidi, CEO of OOMCO, and Monica Varagnat, vice president – Africa, Middle East and India Hub of Air Liquide Group.

The concept study encompasses the generation of renewable energy from solar and wind sources, green hydrogen production, the establishment of hydrogen fueling stations, and the operation of green hydrogen-fueled vehicles, including trucks and buses, all within the confines of the Duqm Special Economic Zone. The study aligns with Oman’s aspirations to exploit green hydrogen fuel within the transportation sector, a pivotal step towards achieving net zero emissions target.

OQ’s Najla said, “This agreement is an important step to continue exploring the sultanate’s promising potential in the field of green fuel, with a particular focus on the potential use of green hydrogen for land transportation in Oman. This initiative aligns with our commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and is consistent with the company’s plans to be a leader in energy transition, which plays a crucial role in positioning Oman as a global center for green industries. We look forward to the study’s successful outcomes and the upcoming pilot project in cooperation with government agencies and our partners.”

Asyad Group’s Balushi said, “The study comes within the organisations that Asyad Group is undertaking in the field of technological leadership to reduce emissions in various operational processes, which aligns with Oman’s plan to achieve leadership by the year 2050. In addition to focusing on developing land transportation assets by providing buses and trucks that operate on biofuel cells, which is very important in exploring all ways for the group to create a clean environment using pure and sustainable fuel.”

Balushi emphasised that the joint study reaffirms Asyad Group’s commitment to sustainability plans and supports green hydrogen projects within SEZAD.

OOMCO’s Junaidi said, “A green hydrogen infrastructure will allow us to adapt further to the shift in the energy landscape and contribute to national efforts to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Hydrogen is a game-changer for decarbonising Oman’s transport sector, and this will enable our company to further diversify its basket of clean products for our customers.”"
