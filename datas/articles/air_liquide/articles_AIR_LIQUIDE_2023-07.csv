Air Liquide signs new green financing for low-carbon hydrogen production in China aligned with EU Taxonomy - Business Wire,"Tue, 18 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIzMDcxODgyNTYzOS9lbi9BaXItTGlxdWlkZS1zaWducy1uZXctZ3JlZW4tZmluYW5jaW5nLWZvci1sb3ctY2FyYm9uLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24taW4tQ2hpbmEtYWxpZ25lZC13aXRoLUVVLVRheG9ub2150gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:

Within the context of its project to build two low-carbon hydrogen production units and related infrastructure in the Shanghai Chemical Industry Park (SCIP), Shanghai Chemical Industry Park Industrial Gases Co., Ltd (SCIPIG), a subsidiary of Air Liquide (Paris:AI), signed a bilateral green loan for 500 million RMB (around 67 million euros) with BNP Paribas as the sole lending bank. This green loan follows the China-EU Common Ground Taxonomy, with stringent criteria on hydrogen production and an emission threshold for the definition of low-carbon hydrogen. It is as well aligned with the international Green Loan Principles 2021 and the Equator Principles (2020). It has received a Second Party Opinion from the independent expert DNV.

It is the first green loan worldwide to support low-carbon hydrogen production in alignment with the new China-EU Common Ground Taxonomy. SCIPIG will monitor the environmental benefits of this project on a regular basis and will report annually to the lender on selected indicators, including the annual avoided greenhouse gases emissions and the hydrogen annual production volume. As they will replace a third party coal-based gasification unit, the new units will avoid the emission of 350,000 tonnes of CO 2 per year, which is equivalent to the electricity related emissions of 1 million Chinese households.

Air Liquide is a front runner in green financing. The Group issued a first SRI-labeled bond as early as 2012 to finance the expansion of its Home Healthcare business. In 2019, it signed a sustainability linked syndicated credit line and, in 2021, it issued a green bond, raising 500 million euros dedicated to financing and refinancing the development of several sustainable projects, in particular in hydrogen, biomethane and oxygen.

Jérôme Pelletan, Chief Financial Officer of Air Liquide Group, said, “This green loan is a recognition of Air Liquide’s ability to uphold projects abiding by the highest environmental standards. It also illustrates our historical pioneering spirit in sustainable financing as this is the first green loan to support low-carbon hydrogen production in alignment with the new China-EU Common Ground Taxonomy. In line with its ADVANCE strategic plan, the Group keeps developing reliable and competitive solutions which help its customers reduce their carbon footprints.”

Air Liquide's decision to sell its stake in Hydrogenics is driven by its strategic plan for 2025, known as ADVANCE. This plan aims to achieve global performance by combining financial and extra-financial dimensions. Air Liquide is streamlining its portfolio to prioritize key strategic initiatives to focus on new markets and capitalize on its major assets, including a resilient business model, innovative capabilities and technological expertise.

A new project has been presented by Air Liquide that aims to address the needs and expectations of patients and healthcare professionals in France, in addition to adapting the company’s business model to meet the challenges of the healthcare system.

Showcasing to employee representatives on July 5th, Air Liquide cited an ageing population, an increased prevalence of chronic illnesses and a stronger desire by most French people to be able to stay at home during treatment as a reason for prioritising home healthcare (HHC).

Despite the growing interest in HHC from French citizens, Air Liquide claim that the homecare model in France continues to be threatened by several factors.

This includes the erosion of reimbursement levels, rising costs linked to a regulatory framework which requires an obligation of means not adapted to individual patient needs, the adoption of new – more expensive – technologies and increasing inflation."

The company reported nearly $5.7 billion in revenue attributed to its gas and services business in the Americas during the first six months of the year, an increase of 6.7% from the first half of 2022.

The company said its operations in the Americas and in Europe paced its growth during that window, although all regions saw increases over that span. Air Liquide reported $15.4 billion in total revenue, up about 5% year-over-year; global gas and services accounted for the vast majority of that amount at nearly $14.8 billion.

Company officials said its net profit jumped by nearly one-third, and that its strategic plan contributed to efficiencies of some $227 million despite continued price inflation.

“In a complex and changing macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, Air Liquide delivered, in the first half of the year, a very solid performance characterized by sales growth on a comparable basis and a new increase in its operating margin excluding the energy impact,” Air Liquide Group CEO François Jackow said in a statement. “This performance highlights the resilience and quality of our business model and is in line with the trajectory of our ADVANCE strategic plan.”

But in its financial results for the first half of 2023, released today (Thursday), the French industrial gases company reveals that it received €156.5m ($142.3m) in the deal.

This effectively gives Hydrogenics — now 100% owned by Cummins — a market value of €823.7m.

The stake purchase may prove to be something of a bargain for the Indiana-based company. By way of comparison, US electrolyser and fuel-cell maker Plug Power — which has similar plans in terms of scaling up manufacturing — currently has a market capitalisation of $7.26bn.

Indiana-based Cummins and Air Liquide acquired the Canadian company in September 2019, which continued operations from its headquarters in Mississauga under the Cummins brand name, with the parent company consolidating its new subsidiary in its financial statements.

Using Hydrogenics’ PEM technology, Cummins has become one of the largest electrolyser makers in the world, with around 3.5GW of annual production capacity in the works.

It is scaling up electrolyser production at Hydrogenics’ factory in Oevel, Belgium, to 1GW; has begun production at a 500MW plant in Foshan, China, as part of a joint venture called Cummins Enze with Chinese oil giant Sinopec, and also at its 500MW production line in Fridley, Minnesota; and is also constructing a 500MW factory in Guadalajara, Spain, in a joint venture with Iberdrola. All three of the new facilities are due to be eventually scaled up to 1GW.

Plug Power is aiming to sell 5GW of electrolysers per year by 2025.

Air Liquide made a net profit of €1.72bn in the first half of this year, according to its results — a 32% year-on-year increase.

Indiana-based Cummins and the French industrial gases company acquired Canadian electrolyser and fuel-cell maker Hydrogenics in September 2019, which continued operations from its headquarters in Mississauga under the Cummins brand name, with the parent company consolidating its new subsidiary in its financial statements.

Using Hydrogenics’ PEM technology, Cummins has become one of the largest electrolyser makers in the world, with around 3.5GW of annual production capacity in the works.

It is scaling up electrolyser production at Hydrogenics’ factory in Oevel, Belgium, to 1GW; has begun production at a 500MW plant in Foshan, China, as part of a joint venture called Cummins Enze with Chinese oil giant Sinopec, and also at its 500MW production line in Fridley, Minnesota; and is also constructing a 500MW factory in Guadalajara, Spain, in a joint venture with Iberdrola. All three of the new facilities are due to be eventually scaled up to 1GW.

“Cummins’ buyout [of Air Liquide’s stake] reinforces its commitment to these technologies [electrolysers and fuel cells] and the increasing importance they will play in creating value for all stakeholders and decarbonizing our world. This move enables continued investment and growth in hydrogen technologies to meet rapidly growing demand,” the US company said in a statement.

Air Liquide said in a statement that its divestment “reflects [its] strategy of regularly reviewing its business portfolio.

“Under Cummins’ full ownership, Hydrogenics will remain one of Air Liquide’s suppliers for electrolyzer projects,” it said, adding: “With a large portfolio of technologies, Air Liquide is more than ever committed to the development of hydrogen and the Group is a leader in developing and operating large scale electrolyzers.”

Cummins is now marketing its electrolysers and fuel cells — and all its zero-emission technologies — through a new brand name, Accelera."
H1 2023: Solid performance and sustained investment momentum paving the way for the future - Air Liquide,"Thu, 27 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5haXJsaXF1aWRlLmNvbS9ncm91cC9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy1uZXdzLzIwMjMtMDctMjcvaDEtMjAyMy1zb2xpZC1wZXJmb3JtYW5jZS1hbmQtc3VzdGFpbmVkLWludmVzdG1lbnQtbW9tZW50dW0tcGF2aW5nLXdheS1mdXR1cmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Commenting on the results in the first half of 2023, François Jackow, Chief Executive Oﬃcer of the Air Liquide Group, stated:

“In a complex and changing macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, Air Liquide delivered, in the first half of the year, a very solid performance characterized by sales growth on a comparable basis and a new increase in its operating margin excluding the energy impact. This performance highlights the resilience and quality of our business model and is in line with the trajectory of our ADVANCE strategic plan.

Revenue reached 13.98 billion euros, an increase of +4.9% on a comparable basis in the first semester. On an as published basis, the year-over-year comparison was -1.6%, due to the drop in energy prices - whose variations are passed on to Large Industries customers - as well as negative currency impacts. The Gas & Services activity, which represented 96% of the Group’s revenue, was up +5.3% on a comparable basis. Within this activity, all regions saw growth, in particular the Americas and Europe, driven notably by Industrial Merchant and Healthcare.

In line with its ADVANCE strategic plan, Air Liquide continued the steady improvement of its operational performance. The Group generated significant efficiencies of 206 million euros, up +24% despite an inflationary context unfavorable to savings on purchases, and continued the dynamic management of its business portfolio. Its ability to create value allowed it to adjust its prices in Industrial Merchant while preserving sales volumes. As a result, the operating margin increased further, by +80 basis points excluding the energy impact.

Net profit (Group share) amounted to 1.72 billion euros, up +32% as published. Recurring net proﬁt[1] increased by +11.3% excluding currency impacts. Cash flow[2] grew by +13% excluding currency impacts. The balance sheet is strong with a net debt to equity ratio of 39.2%[3]. Recurring ROCE[4], which amounted to 10.2% at end-June, remains above 10%, in line with ADVANCE’s objectives.

In terms of outlook, the Group's investment momentum remained strong, reflecting our commitment to climate and paving the way for future growth. The project backlog, at 3.5 billion euros, remained high. Investment decisions reached 1.8 billion euros this semester. With more than 40% of projects linked to the energy transition, 12-month investment opportunities are numerous and total 3.4 billion euros.

In 2023, Air Liquide is conﬁdent in its ability to further increase its operating margin and to deliver recurring net proﬁt growth, at constant exchange rates[5].”

Published sales in the 1st half of 2023 were down slightly by -1.4%, impacted by negative energy and currency impacts of -4.9% and -2.1% respectively, the significant scope impact being limited (+0.3%).

Gas & Services revenue in the Americas reached 5,159 million euros in the 1 st half of 2023, representing a comparable increase of +6.7% . Sales in the Industrial Merchant business were up sharply, by +10.0%, driven by a high price effect (+7.5%). Customer shutdowns penalized Large Industries sales (-3.9%) while volumes remained solid overall in the US Gulf Coast. In Healthcare, price increases in Proximity Care in the United States and the dynamism of Home Healthcare in Canada and South America were the main contributors to the very strong increase in sales (+13.5%). Lastly, after very solid growth in 2022, revenue from the Electronics business was down by -5.8% in the 1 st half due to the sharp decline in sales of materials in the 2 nd quarter, in a context of slowdown in demand from memory manufacturers.

Revenue in Europe was up +4.8% on a comparable basis during the 1 st half of 2023 and reached 4,975 million euros . In Industrial Merchant, the very strong increase in sales of +18.1% bene ﬁ ted from a price effect that remained very high at +19.0%. Healthcare sales were up +5.8%, driven notably by the strong development of diabetes treatment in Home Healthcare and higher medical gas prices in response to infl ation. Large Industries revenue was down -3.6% in the 1 st half-year, however this was a significant improvement compared to the 2 nd half of 2022 heavily impacted by the sharp increase in energy prices.

Sales in Asia Paci ﬁ c were up +3.8% on a comparable basis in the 1 st half of 2023 and amounted to 2,763 million euros . Large Industries revenue, down -5.9%, was impacted in particular by weak demand and customer shutdowns.

In the Electronics business (+7.3%), after double-digit sales growth in the 1 st quarter, revenue growth was more moderate in the 2 nd quarter (+4.3%).

Revenue in the Middle East & Africa region increased by +5.8% on a comparable basis to 508 million euros in the 1st half of 2023. The sales growth in air gases in South Africa and Egypt explained the solid performance of Large Industries. In Industrial Merchant, a high price effect (+8.7%) and the increase in volumes made it possible to fully absorb the impact of the divestiture of businesses in the Middle East and achieve solid sales growth.

Industrial Merchant revenue continued to grow strongly (+12.1%), driven by a high price effect of +10.7% and growing volumes. Large Industries revenue, down -3.6% in a context of weak demand, saw a significant improvement compared to a 2nd half of 2022 which was heavily impacted by the sharp increase in energy prices, in Europe in particular. Electronics sales were up +6.3% in the half-year: following double-digit growth in the 1st quarter, revenue growth was more moderate in the 2nd quarter due to a very high basis of comparison in 2022 and lower demand from memory manufacturers. Lastly, the strong growth in sales in Healthcare (+8.2%) was supported by the increase in the prices of medical gases in an inflationary context and the dynamism of Home Healthcare.

Consolidated revenue from Engineering & Construction totaled 180 million euros in the 1st half of 2023, down -17.3% compared to the high sales to third-party customers in the 1st half of 2022.

Net earnings per share rose by +32.0% compared with the 1st half of 2022, in line with the increase in net profit (Group share). These stood at 3.30 euros per share compared with 2.50 euros per share in the 1st half of 2022.

Cash ﬂows from operating activities before changes in working capital amounted to 3,211 million euros during the 1st half of 2023, representing a sharp increase of +10.4% and +13.2% excluding the currency impact.

Net debt at June 30, 2023 reached 10,550 million euros, a sharp decrease compared with 12,010 million euros at June 30, 2022 and an increase of 289 million euros compared with December 31, 2022, following the payment of more than 1.6 billion euros in dividends in May.

The return on capital employed after tax (ROCE) was 10.0% for the 1st half of 2023. At 10.2%, recurring ROCE[8] remained above the target of 10.0% in the Advance strategic plan, and was up sharply by +50 basis points compared to the 1st half of 2022.

In order to accelerate the decarbonization of its production units, Air Liquide announced in the 1st half of 2023 the signing of long-term renewable energy supply contracts (PPAs) for more than 1,000 GWh per year. This will equate to a reduction of its annual CO2 emissions by approximately -970,000 tonnes.

In the 1st half of 2023, industrial and financial investment decisions amounted to 1,798 million euros. They were stable compared to the very high level of the 1st half of 2022.

At 3.5 billion euros, the investment backlog remained at a very high level for three quarters and posted a strong increase compared to the 3.0 billion euros in the 1st half of 2022.

RADNOR, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Airgas, an Air Liquide company and a leading U.S. supplier of industrial, medical and specialty gases, safety and welding products, has installed two strategically located argon storage nodes to further strengthen the argon supply chain for its customers, who use argon in automotive and aeronautical, electronic, manufacturing and metal fabrication applications.

The argon nodes were completed in late 2022/early 2023, and are located in Moraine, Ohio and Guilderland, NY. Both store enough argon to fill around 40 tanker trucks each. Airgas will be installing a third Argon node, which is expected to be operational by the end of this year.

These storage relays provide more flexibility in argon distribution by moving more Airgas product inventory closer to customers and were added in response to recent rail transportation delays and logistics challenges. Airgas continues to take action as a company to minimize supply chain disruption effects, safely enhance essential operations and meet customer needs throughout the country.

Marcelo Fioranelli, CEO, commented: “ Our investment in these argon storage nodes will provide additional resilience in our supply chain as we strive to provide world class experience and reliability to our customers.”

Air Liquide presents a project to transform its Home Healthcare activity in France - Air Liquide,"Wed, 05 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5haXJsaXF1aWRlLmNvbS9ncm91cC9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy1uZXdzLzIwMjMtMDctMDUvYWlyLWxpcXVpZGUtcHJlc2VudHMtcHJvamVjdC10cmFuc2Zvcm0taXRzLWhvbWUtaGVhbHRoY2FyZS1hY3Rpdml0eS1mcmFuY2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On July 5, 2023, the management of Air Liquide Healthcare presented a project to transform its Home Healthcare activity in France to employee representatives. The project aims to address the needs and expectations of patients and healthcare professionals, and to adapt the activity’s business model to meet the challenges of the healthcare system.

The aging of the population, combined with the increasing prevalence of chronic illnesses and the desire of the vast majority of French people to be able to stay at home for as long as possible, place home healthcare (HHC) as an essential component in the organization of the healthcare system. However, the homecare model in France is threatened by a number of factors: the continuing erosion of reimbursement levels, rising costs linked to a regulatory framework which requires an obligation of means not adapted to individual patient needs, the adoption of new, more expensive, technologies and the acceleration of the inflationary context since 2021.

Despite this context, Air Liquide continues to firmly believe in this business and its professions. Since 1986, the Air Liquide Group has made home healthcare one of its strategic priorities. Today, with 1.9 million patients with chronic illnesses being cared for at home, worldwide, Air Liquide's ambition is to support the shift to homecare, and to provide more personalized attention to the needs of patients and healthcare professionals, through outcome-based care for patients, at the best possible cost to the healthcare system.

As a key partner of the healthcare system, Air Liquide intends to make a responsible contribution to its necessary transformation by defining a new organizational model for its Home Healthcare activities in France.

The transformation project presented to employee representatives would involve reshaping the operational organization of one of the Group's main homecare entities, Pharma Dom, simplifying its brand portfolio, and regrouping some of its locations. It would also aim to bring together certain cross-functional roles within a single entity. A technology investment plan is part of this transformation project, in order to optimize processes and facilitate the day-to-day work of teams for patient care and their exchanges with healthcare professionals.

Currently subject to consultation with employee representatives, this project would lead to a reduction of 430 net positions. In line with the Group's values, the plan would provide for the implementation of appropriate measures to support all employees concerned.

While the project will use fossil gas to produce hydrogen via steam methane reforming (SMR), while capturing an unspecified proportion of the carbon produced, it will also replace a third-party coal gasification unit that currently supplies the park.

China currently produces around 70% of its H 2 from coal gasification, which is the most carbon-intensive hydrogen production method, emitting 22-26kg of CO 2 -equivalent per kilo of H 2 produced.

The Shanghai facilities will turn the captured carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide for industrial use.

Air Liquide already has offtake agreements in place for both hydrogen and carbon monoxide lasting more than 15 years with fellow companies in the industry park — Covestro and Shanghai Lianheng Isocyanate Company (a joint venture led by Western chemical producers BASF and Huntsman).

Air Liquide estimates that the project will cost more than €200m ($224m) to build and abate 350,000 tonnes of annual CO 2 emissions.

The finance from BNP was provided as a green loan aligned with the EU-China Common Ground Taxonomy, which sets a lifecycle emissions threshold of three tonnes of CO 2 -equivalent per tonne of hydrogen produced.

Since unabated SMR directly emits 9kgCO 2 /kgH 2 , this would require the units to capture at least two thirds of that carbon dioxide — and the overall level of greenhouse gases will likely be higher due to upstream emissions from methane supply.

Hydrogen Insight has reached out to Air Liquide to confirm the expected capture rate of the SMR units to be built in Shanghai.

SCIPIG is required to regularly monitor the plant’s environmental impact and annually report back to the bank on avoided greenhouse gas emissions and H 2 production.

“This green loan is a recognition of Air Liquide’s ability to uphold projects abiding by the highest environmental standards,” said the company’s chief financial officer Jérôme Pelletan.

“It also illustrates our historical pioneering spirit in sustainable financing as this is the first green loan to support low-carbon hydrogen production in alignment with the new China-EU Common Ground Taxonomy.”"
RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS FACILITY COMING TO CENTER TOWNSHIP - wccsradio.com,"Wed, 05 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndjY3NyYWRpby5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8wNS81NjEwNTEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Center Township will soon be home to a renewable natural gas production facility that will turn farm waste into energy.

The Indiana County Development Corporation this afternoon revealed details about the project that will convert cow manure into biomethane (renewable natural gas, or “RNG”). Operating out of Lot Two at the 119 Business Park, the venture will partner Aire Liquide Advanced Technologies U.S, which is based in Houston, Texas, with the ICDC and eighteen to twenty dairy farms.

The farms will store manure in airtight containers called anaerobic digesters. Absent oxygen, the manure will decompose and produce biogas, which will be purified at the plant in Center Township. The gas will be injected into Peoples Natural Gas’s pipeline system for residential and commercial use. Farmers will also benefit through the return of the solid and liquid byproducts for bedding for their herds and for fertilizer. The farmers will also receive quarterly cash payments for their product.

Air Liquide has already signed an interconnection agreement with Peoples.

Two state grants totaling about $2.25 million have been secured by Senator Joe Pittman and Representative Jim Struzzi to prepare the 119 Business Park for the new facility. Approximately 4,100 feet of pipeline will be needed to connect the park to the Peoples regulation station north of Neal Road.

Struzzi called the facility a “win-win” for Indiana County.

Struzzi adds that while the plant will provide a good source of energy to the county, it does not overshadow the expected closure of the Homer City Generating Station.

Key Green Hydrogen Market Driver- The growing adoption of clean fuel is the major factor driving the market growth. The formation of green hydrogen involves an electrochemical reaction that efficiently separates oxygen and hydrogen. This process is highly reliable and boasts high output efficiency. The production of green hydrogen is considered clean and environmentally friendly because it relies on renewable energy sources like solar and wind power for the electrolysis process. The zero-emission nature of green hydrogen makes it a favorable alternative to fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas, leading to its increased adoption and driving market growth. Generally, renewable power plants are located at distant locations from the end-users. In such cases, if the generated power is used for electrolysis to produce green hydrogen, the transportation would have been commoditized and unconstrained by grid connection, which is similar to LNG. Therefore, due to the growing demand for green hydrogen, the rising shift toward integrating hydrogen electrolysers with renewables is expected to continue to drive market growth during the forecast period.

Significant Green Hydrogen Market Trends- The increasing support given by the European governments is an emerging trend shaping market growth.

Major Green Hydrogen Market Challenge- The high initial cost will be a major challenge hindering the market growth.

PLD Space wins partnership contract to develop a micro launcher – SatNews - news.satnews.com,"Wed, 05 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5zYXRuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA3LzA1L3BsZC1zcGFjZS13aW5zLXBhcnRuZXJzaGlwLWNvbnRyYWN0LXRvLWRldmVsb3AtYS1taWNyby1sYXVuY2hlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Artistic rendition of Muira 5, courtesy of PLD Space.

PLD Space, with Aciturri, AIRBUS, Air Liquide, ALTER, Anteral, Applus, Caye, CECOM, CMASA, Deimos, INSYTE, LOGO 2, Mecanizados Especiales, OCCAM, Repsol, Swagelok, Talleres Ramón Clemente and Tecno Lanema, has won the PERTE contract from the Spanish Government to develop a micro launcher.

PLD Space obtained the best, technical qualification by the Contracting Board, which positively valued the trajectory and key industrial capacity that guarantee the development of the MIURA 5 as a leading solution for access to space.

PLD Space is the only Spanish company with experience developing launchers and the necessary infrastructure and capacity to develop, manufacture and launch an orbital rocket into space in just two and a half years. Thanks to PERTE, the company will be able to accelerate the development and manufacturing of MIURA 5 and become the first private company in Europe to commercialize space access services.

PLD Space is one of three European companies authorized by the French Space Agency (CNES), through a binding agreement, to operate MIURA 5 from the CSG Space Centre in French Guiana.

The first phase of the PERTE contract, which will start once the documentation is signed, is worth 1.5 million euros for each successful bidder and will focus on the design of the launcher and will close in December of 2023. The tendering body will then evaluate the proposals submitted and the most competitive design will move on to a second phase in 2024, which is valued at 40.5 million euros.

The company is currently immersed in the launch of MIURA 1, which has been fully designed by PLD Space as a technology demonstrator with recovery and reusability requirements that only three companies have achieved in space This first suborbital flight of MIURA 1 is a turning point for the development of the MIURA 5 orbital launcher, as it will allow to extract a large amount of information to validate much of the design and technology that will serve as the basis for the development of the MIURA 5 orbital launcher.

“We are working to facilitate European access to space and very soon we will achieve it. If we want Spain to become the tenth country with direct access to space, we must encourage private-public collaboration, but we cannot replicate in PERTE what has not worked before in ESA programs. We must work together to be more agile and with a different style of leadership and risk-taking. The company’s track record, coupled with its high industrial capabilities and financial strength, together with MIURA 5 supply chain drive and its commercial potential, consolidate PLD Space as one of the reference players in the small space launcher sector at European level, which has been positively assessed by the PERTE aerospace tendering authority.” — Ezequiel Sánchez, CEO, PLD Space”

“Thanks to this contract, Spain and PLD Space will be able to compete in the global market for launch services for satellites of less than 500kg without any complexes. As we have demonstrated in the past, this public contract will allow us to triple the total budget available with private investment, ensuring that we will be able to deliver our first MIURA 5 unit within the demanding timelines set by this contract, and to provide Spain with independent access to space.” — Raúl Verdú, Co-Founder and Business Development Director, PLD Space

“We are progressing at breakneck speed in the development of MIURA 5 thanks to MIURA 1, as we have an integrated team and a clear engineering strategy. Although we failed to launch on the last attempt, we were able to complete all procedures and reach the self-sequence phase on time, with nominal engine start and thrust. All these learnings are being transferred to the development of MIURA 5, so we are making a qualitative leap in its development.” — Raul Torres, CEO and Co-Founder, PLD Space"
'Foolish business owners who push forward with hydrogen vehicles will be fired by their shareholders': H2 taxi operator - Hydrogen Insight,"Mon, 24 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oeWRyb2dlbmluc2lnaHQuY29tL3RyYW5zcG9ydC9mb29saXNoLWJ1c2luZXNzLW93bmVycy13aG8tcHVzaC1mb3J3YXJkLXdpdGgtaHlkcm9nZW4tdmVoaWNsZXMtd2lsbC1iZS1maXJlZC1ieS10aGVpci1zaGFyZWhvbGRlcnMtaDItdGF4aS1vcGVyYXRvci8yLTEtMTQ5MDQ4MtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The head of a Japanese taxi company that started operating two hydrogen-powered Toyota Mirai cars as taxis in May in the city of Kobe has been less than impressed with their economics.

Yoshiaki Aoki, president of MK West Japan Group, told Bloomberg Japan that fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) have poorer fuel efficiency compared to hybrid vehicles, so operating an FCEV as a taxi that drives about 150,000km annually, requires an additional fuel cost of ¥1m ($7,047).

As customers will not pay double to ride in a hydrogen taxi, “foolish business owners who push forward with the introduction of FCEVs will be fired by their shareholders”, he said, according to Bloomberg Japan.

Although it has been eight-and-a-half years since the Mirai, the world’s first production hydrogen car, was launched in Japan, less than 8,000 FCEVs have been sold in the country to date.

Even though there are 181 hydrogen filling stations operating or under construction in Japan, the scarcity of these is still being touted as the reason why FCEVs have not taken off nationally.

Air Liquide Japan, which operates the H2 pump powering MK West’s two Mirais, told Bloomberg Japan that there are two inherent problems with operating commercial hydrogen filling stations.

“We can’t build a station because there’s no demand, and we can’t sell cars because there’s no station,” said senior managing executive officer Takahiro Ueno.

Despite government subsidies and financial support from automakers such as Toyota, with less than 50 vehicles per filling station, “hydrogen sold for so-called mobility is not profitable”.

Aoki said that H2 fuel in Japan needs to be at least half the current price before he would consider introducing more FCEVs to his company’s fleet, and then he would convert all the group’s 500 taxis to hydrogen."
Shocking moment furious truckie drives into climate activists - Yahoo News Australia,"Fri, 14 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vYXUubmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vc2hvY2tpbmctbW9tZW50LWZ1cmlvdXMtdHJ1Y2tpZS1kcml2ZXMtaW50by1jbGltYXRlLWFjdGl2aXN0cy0wNTUxMjk2NjAuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A furious truckie has lost his job after he was filmed driving into climate activists who were protesting on a major road.

Six protesters had positioned themselves in the path of traffic in Germany's Stralsund on Wednesday, bringing the man's truck to a halt.

Video, which has circulated widely on social media, shows the truck driver exiting his vehicle before dragging one protester onto the footpath. He then shoves another to the ground before raising a fist at him. The 41-year-old returns to his vehicle as the first protester sits back down.

The truck driver then drives into the two men, shoving one a few metres along the concrete, nearly running him over before braking.

Following the dramatic incident, the driver later handed himself in to authorities and police confiscated the driver's licence, German media reports. A court is to decide whether his licence will be revoked indefinitely.

The truck driver's employer, industrial gas supplier Air Liquide, told Deutsche Presse-Agentur his actions are ""unacceptable"" and have instructed management he should ""no longer drive for us"", according to German outlet Focus.

Police said no one was injured during the incident. The truck driver is being investigated for assault while the protesters are being investigated for violating the assembly law and suspected coercion in road traffic.

Protesters glue themselves to airport runways

It came a day before climate activists staged an airport protest by gluing themselves to runways at several major German airports, leading to the cancellation of dozens of flights, The Telegraph reported.

“We cannot watch any longer as our earth burns and the government continues to throw oil on the fire every day,” a 21-year-old protester said in a video while glued to a runway.

Climate activists have been staging similar protests in Australia for several years now, with state governments introducing harsher punishments for those causing major disruption.

Groups such as Extinction Rebellion, Fireproof Australia and Blockade Australia have been responsible for several high-profile stunts in protest against Australia's use and sale of fossil fuels.

China has the most hydrogen-powered vehicles on the roads than any other country. And Shanghai in particular is leading the way in building hydrogen energy infrastructure, opening up the possibility of greater use of hydrogen energy in the mobility sector, he said.

“What we want to do is to find the right location where there's enough infrastructure density,” Jackow said. “We will contribute by bringing low-carbon hydrogen, and then will work with partners to build the infrastructure like filling stations and on transportation.”

And Paris-based Air Liquide has been teaming up with oil major Sinopec and other Chinese partners in Shanghai and Tianjin on hydrogen cooperation projects in recent years.

“In Shanghai and Tianjin, for example, we don't want to work alone and we are making partnerships, especially for filling stations, as that is not our core business and we need partners to distribute the hydrogen. You can bring a lot of value, but for refueling stations, it's much better to worth with someone else,” he added.

“Hydrogen is a better solution for heavy-duty transportation. The challenge, of course, is infrastructure. We need more filling stations. That's why we need to focus on specific areas where the Infrastructure density can be improved. And we need to have more trucks available and more buses.

“And of course, there will be economies of scale. The more trucks there are, the cost of running each truck will go down. There is already support and incentives from local governments to promote this kind of mobility. Of course, we would like to see more support to accelerate this transition,” he added.

Air Liquide has been paying close attention to China’s industrial trends and policies for many years and has deployed liquid hydrogen technologies together with Chinese energy businesses. In March last year, Air Liquide set up a joint venture to build a hydrogen refuelling hub in the Shanghai Chemical Industry Park. The first phase, costing CNY180 million (USD25.1 million), opened in August last year with a daily refueling capacity of 24 tons.

And in April, it launched a hydrogen energy supply base costing over CNY1 billion (USD140 million) in the Lingang area of the Tianjin Port Free Trade Zone. The first phase is expected to be put into operation in the second half of 2024.

“There's no question that China is a very important market for us. We have invested a lot in China over the past 30 years, and we will continue to do so. We want to support the development of the Chinese economy, which is well aligned with what we want to bring to society and to our customers,” Jackow said.

Expanding Footprint

Other hydrogen energy companies are also expanding their footprint in China. French rival Plastic Omnium is linking arms with Shenergy in Shanghai to provide high-pressure hydrogen storage systems for the Chinese commercial vehicle market, according the memorandum of understanding signed by the two parties in January.

Hydrogen will account for at least 10 percent of China’s end-user energy system by 2050, and hydrogen demand will be close to 60 million tons, the China Hydrogen Alliance said.

France is China’s third largest trading partner in the EU. In the first five months, France’s actual investment in China surged more than five-fold from a year earlier, despite only a slight increase of 0.1 percent in the country's actual use of foreign capital, according to data from the Ministry of Commerce.

"Cummins strengthens fuel cell, electrolyzer portfolio with buyout of Hydrogenics - ETN News","Tue, 04 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vZXRuLm5ld3MvYnV6ei9jdW1taW5zLWh5ZHJvZ2VuaWNzLWNvbXBsZXRlLW93bmVyc2hpcC1haXItbGlxdWlkZS1mdWVsLWNlbGwtZWxlY3Ryb2x5emVyc9IBa2h0dHBzOi8vZXRuLm5ld3MvYnV6ei9jdW1taW5zLWh5ZHJvZ2VuaWNzLWNvbXBsZXRlLW93bmVyc2hpcC1haXItbGlxdWlkZS1mdWVsLWNlbGwtZWxlY3Ryb2x5emVycz9mb3JtYXQ9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"



The buyout reinforces its commitment to these technologies and the increasing importance they will play in creating value for all stakeholders and decarbonizing our world, according to Cummins.









This move enables continued investment and growth in hydrogen technologies to meet rapidly growing demand, the company adds. Cummins acquired 81 percent of ownership in Hydrogenics back in 2019 to expand its presence in the hydrogen markets, along with Air Liquide.





Tom Linebarger, Chairman and CEO of Cummins, commented on the development, ""This is another step forward as we continue to invest in a broad range of clean, fuel-efficient and high-performing products and technologies that deliver value to our customers.""





The companies have informed that Hydrogenics will continue to be one of Air Liquide's suppliers for its electrolyzer products.









In recent times, Cummins is making strident progress in terms of the scale-up of electrolyzer production, targeting GW-scale capacities and establishing new 500 MW range projects in both the US and European markets.

Cummins Inc. has recently announced the complete buyout of Air Liquide's 19 percent interest in Hydrogenics Corporation, resulting in the company assuming full ownership of Hydrogenics and adding key fuel cell and electrolyzer technologies to its portfolio."
Edmonton International (YEG) to run 100 Mirai hydrogen cars - www.electrive.com,"Tue, 18 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsZWN0cml2ZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wNy8xOC9lZG1vbnRvbi1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLXllZy10by1ydW4tMTAwLW1pcmFpLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLWNhcnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toyota Canada has scored a significant deal with Edmonton International Airport (YEG). Passengers arriving in the capital of Alberta province may soon see Mirai hydrogen cars zooming about. The airport ordered 100 FCEVs as part of a more significant challenge in the Edmonton region.

The partners call the order a “key development in Alberta’s clean fuels journey” and add that this was the province’s first fleet of hydrogen-powered zero-emission vehicles.

The announcement did not include information about the Mirai uses at Edmonton International. The airport only mentions it has been “coordinating efforts for various fleets and fuel suppliers to invest in hydrogen technology confidently”.

“YEG’s fleet of Toyota Mirai FCEVs will help accelerate the use of hydrogen in Alberta, and having on-site hydrogen fueling infrastructure will make them a true hub, spurring the growth of Alberta’s hydrogen economy,” added Stephen Beatty, Vice President of Toyota Canada.

Said infrastructure will come from Sir Liquide. YEG announced both deals simultaneously. For now, the partnership will see Air Liquide deliver an interim mobile hydrogen refuelling station at YEG.

“YEG is proud to bring together companies from around the world to form partnerships, test new technologies and showcase the power of emissions-free hydrogen fuels,” said Myron Keehn, President & CEO of Edmonton International Airport (YEG). “These vehicles and our partnership with Toyota Canada will help reduce emissions, attract investment and kick-start the Edmonton Metro Region’s 5,000 Vehicle Challenge. The future is here, and it’s being developed at YEG.”

Indeed, YEG is in line with efforts across the province. The Edmonton Metro Region is running the ‘5,000 Vehicle Challenge’ to help bring 5,000 hydrogen and hydrogen dual-fuel vehicles in Alberta by 2028. Led by the Edmonton Region Hydrogen HUB, the challenge focuses on the commercial transportation sector.

“This initiative raises the profile of clean hydrogen as a viable transportation fuel, supporting the Alberta government’s plan to make Alberta a global hydrogen leader,” commented Dale Nally, Minister of Service Alberta and Red Tape Reduction.

Edmonton International Airport (YEG) is a self-funded, not-for-profit corporation running Canada’s fifth-busiest airport by passenger traffic and the largest major Canadian airport by land area. It runs the ‘Airport City Sustainability Campus’ and signed The Climate Pledge driven by Amazon.

Lorry driver who almost ran over climate protestor has licence seized - trans.info/en,"Fri, 14 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdHJhbnMuaW5mby9lbi9sb3JyeS1kcml2ZXItd2hvLWFsbW9zdC1yYW4tb3Zlci1jbGltYXRlLXByb3Rlc3Rvci1oYXMtbGljZW5jZS1zZWl6ZWQtMzUzMTkw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Footage of the incident was uploaded to the Letzte Generation Twitter feed on Wednesday.

The clip shows a furious trucker trying to drag two protestors off the road onto the pavement. He temporarily succeeds in dragging one off the road, before pushing another and threatening them with a clenched fist.

The driver then returns to his cab and drives right into the path of one of the men in the blockade, pushing him forward around 1 metre.

In the caption accompanying the video, Letzte Generation tweeted: “What will people do when harvests fail and there is not enough food and drinking water for everyone? Let’s come together as a society and find solutions together so that it doesn’t come to that.”

According to police, nobody was seriously injured.

Soon after the incident came to light, Air Liquide, who the trucker had been driving for via a 3rd party, said it had made it clear to its logistics partner that the HGV driver should no longer work for them. The company added that the request was contractually available to them and had been accepted.

“Such behavior is unacceptable, regardless of how one views the Last Generation discussion,” Air Liquide spokesperson Andreas Voß told the German Press Agency.

The police are investigating the truck driver on suspicion of attempted bodily harm. The trucker’s licence has also been seized and the local district court are set to decide on whether to issue him a temporary driving ban or not.

Meanwhile, the climate activists are being investigated for violating assembly law [which usually means the protest was not registered] and suspected “coercion in road traffic”.

Wednesday’s incident was just one example of the disruption caused by Letzte Generation, who also targeted airports.

The protests have proved highly controversial in Germany, much like Just Stop Oil’s stunts in the UK.

Even Climate Protection Minister Robert Habeck, who represents the Green party in Germany, thinks Letzte Generation are taking things too far:"
Eco-activists coat jet with paint in Ibiza as driver pushes through eco road block in Germany - Daily Mail,"Fri, 14 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtMTIyOTg3OTcvRWNvLWFjdGl2aXN0cy1jb2F0LWpldC1wYWludC1JYml6YS1kcml2ZXItcHVzaGVzLWVjby1yb2FkLWJsb2NrLUdlcm1hbnkuaHRtbNIBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTEyMjk4Nzk3L2FtcC9FY28tYWN0aXZpc3RzLWNvYXQtamV0LXBhaW50LUliaXphLWRyaXZlci1wdXNoZXMtZWNvLXJvYWQtYmxvY2stR2VybWFueS5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Eco activists were seen to have sprayed a private jet yellow in Ibiza, Spain

Eco-activists in Ibiza have today shared the aftermath of covering a private jet in yellow paint amid growing protests globally demanding climate action.

Futuro Vegetal (Vegetable Future) claimed to have worked with Extinction Rebellion Ibiza on the 'action'.

Video from the scene showed one of the group's 'militants' speaking in front of the plane. One said: 'I am here today because it terrifies me, not having a future.'

Meanwhile, footage of climate protestors in Germany went viral after zealots clashed with the driver of an Air Liquide lorry, a company 'promoting energy transition'.

The clip shared online appears to show Letzte Generation protestors sitting in the road to block traffic before a lorry driver attempts to push through.

One activist is dragged along the road by the moving truck before the driver relents, gets out and pulls them out of the road to pass safely.

Video showed the extent of graffiti covering the plane as eco activists protested 'luxury'

The nose of the plane was covered in yellow paint, shown in the video shared by Futuro Vegetal

In the Ibiza video, activist Marina appears to cite the statistic that the richest 1% of the world's population were responsible for more than twice as much carbon pollution as the poorest half.

She says the luxury industry consumes and contaminates common resources and all life that lives on the planet.

'The rich are a luxury that we cannot allow. Act!'

The video then cuts to a man covering the plane in black and yellow paint. He climbs on the wing and appears to glue himself to the fuselage.

On the other side, Marina is seen waving yellow smoke. The plane and ground are seen covered in different paints.

At the end of the video, a message reads: 'We can't carry on maintaining your privileges. Eat the rich. Help us.'

Futuro Vegetal describes itself as a collective of civil disobedience and direct action fighting against the climate crisis.

They call for the adoption of a plant-based agrifood system and make various demands of the government for reform.

MailOnline reached out to Futuro Vegetal for comment.

The driver is pictured trying to drag the protestor sitting in the road out from under the lorry

In the video titled 'Truck driver nearly runs over Letzte Generation human', three climate protestors are seen to sit down in the road in front of a Air Liquide lorry.

Air Liquide is the Paris Olympics' official hydrogen supporter and works to innovate 'the development of low-carbon hydrogen and biomethane for the energy transition'.

The protestors appear to be with Letzte Generation. The group was founded in 2021 and operational in Germany, Italy and Austria.

They are pictured holding orange banners, though it is unclear what they say from the angle.

The driver of the lorry at first jumps out to push and drag the activists out of his way.

When they sit back in position, he slowly starts driving forwards - and then shunts the activist closest to the pavement.

The push is enough to send the young man flying back and bystanders come to his aid.

The lorry driver is seen throwing his hands up in frustration and stops the lorry.

Again, he gets out and drags the protestor out of the way, creating enough space to drive between them.

As the camera moves, video shows a queue of vehicles behind the lorry.

Air Liquide Group, the company that owns the lorry, is a self-described world leader in gases, technology and services for industry and health.

According to their Instagram channel, their ambition is 'to deliver long term performance and contribute to a more sustainable world'.

The company recently became the Official Hydrogen Supporter of the Olympic and Paralympic Games for 2024.

They say they aim to 'help reduce the carbon emissions' of the Paris Olympics 'to accelerate the deployment of hydrogen mobility from renewable sources'.

Air Liquide provided the following statement to MailOnline: 'On July 12, Air Liquide was made aware of an altercation in Stralsund, Germany, between a third-party contract driver of Air Liquide Medical Gases and local protesters.

'Images display unacceptable behavior from the driver that is not aligned with Air Liquide’s values in any way.

'The third-party contractor has been notified that Air Liquide will no longer accept the services of this individual.'

The lorry ploughed through the protestors, knocking one back before the driver stopped

The footage showed the driver pushing one of the protestors after they obstructed the road

Letzte Generation is a climate activist group operational in Central Europe.

The name means 'Last Generation' in English.

Letzte Generation is known for its road protests, staging 276 road blockages in Germany alone throughout 2022.

MailOnline contacted Letzte Generation for comment."

The video shows two protesters sitting in a crosswalk with a large orange sign. The driver gets out of his big rig, shoves them, and drags one of them onto the sidewalk before getting back into his truck. He then hits the gas. pushing the protesters forward with his truck.

The driver later handed himself over to German authorities who confiscated his license, reports Yahoo. A court will decide whether or not he will lose the license permanently. (RELATED: Climate Activists Trigger Dozens Of Flight Cancellations After Gluing Themselves To Airport Runways)

The man, identified only as a 41-year-old male, was a driver for gas supplier Air Liquide, according to Yahoo. Following the incident the company terminated his employment, according to German-language news outlet Focus. “We informed the forwarding agency directly that this driver should no longer drive for us,” said a company spokesman, according to Focus.

"After Micron, semiconductor component players to set up India operations - BusinessLine","Mon, 31 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdWJ1c2luZXNzbGluZS5jb20vaW5mby10ZWNoL2FmdGVyLW1pY3Jvbi1zZW1pY29uZHVjdG9yLWNvbXBvbmVudC1wbGF5ZXJzLXRvLXNldC11cC1pbmRpYS1vcGVyYXRpb25zL2FydGljbGU2NzEzOTMxMS5lY2XSAY8BaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlaGluZHVidXNpbmVzc2xpbmUuY29tL2luZm8tdGVjaC9hZnRlci1taWNyb24tc2VtaWNvbmR1Y3Rvci1jb21wb25lbnQtcGxheWVycy10by1zZXQtdXAtaW5kaWEtb3BlcmF0aW9ucy9hcnRpY2xlNjcxMzkzMTEuZWNlL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The first signs of localisation of the semiconductor ecosystem are beginning to show up. After Micron announced its plans to set up a packaging and testing unit in India, at least 4 to 5 of the top suppliers of components and materials to the semiconductor industry are set to follow suit, according to top industry sources.

Players like Simmtech and Air Liquide that provide printed circuit boards and high-purity industrial gases for chip manufacturing, respectively are in talks with the government to start operations in India.

One of these suppliers, Simmtech has also likely received approval from the government, as it plans to set up a unit in the industrial town of Sanand, along with Micron, as per the source.

Co-location investment

“We are now evaluating and preparing for another co-location investment with Micron. The key consideration is whether we can receive the same level of support from the local government. We would like the local agencies to view our project not as a standalone project, but as a part of the entire supply chain,” said Jeffery Chun of Simmtech.

Chun said, “Our co-location project is focussed on our global customer’s movement. But at the same time, we understand that especially in India, there is a huge demand for our products printed circuit boards and IC substrates.”

Top government officials told businessline that the electronics industry, especially for laptops and mobile phones, will benefit from the localisation of the production of printed circuit boards, which invites a huge custom levy when imported.

Another company, which is likely in discussions with the government is the provider of high-purity industrial gases, Air Liquide.

Raja Vinay, business development lead at Air Liquide, said, “We are keenly looking at the developments and rapid strides of the semicon sector and we will contribute to the development of this ecosystem.”

Capex subsidy

However, like Micron, the ecosystem players are also betting on receiving support from the government. Vinay said the government should consider extending the capex subsidy benefits and provide land allocation and uninterrupted power supply to the new units.

Kulicke & Soffa, which supplies equipment solutions for chip packaging, could also be in the fray to start India operations. Chan Pin Chong, Executive Vice-President and General Manager of Kulicke & Soffa (K&S), said that they would not want to be inhibited by import duties.

“From a regulatory perspective, it’s important to understand we get the parts in and out in the region hubs. For example, when you run a 24x7 factory in Gujarat, we would like to see how we can move-in parts and storage without being inhibited by import duties and regulatory things that can slow down the process,” he said."
Raise productivity with cryogenic freezing applications - FOOD Magazine - Australia,"Mon, 03 Jul 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2RtYWcuY29tLmF1L3JhaXNlLXByb2R1Y3Rpdml0eS13aXRoLWNyeW9nZW5pYy1mcmVlemluZy1hcHBsaWNhdGlvbnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As a gas expert, Air Liquide provides its food industry customers with full process support and services, such as the implementation of cryogenic freezing processes, including the use of liquid nitrogen.

A wide range of freezing and chilling services continues to help food manufacturers maintain quality and freshness, as well as help limit moisture loss.

Whether it’s preserving food quality during the grinding and mixing process in a safe and sanitary environment, or moving temperature-sensitive foods via refrigerated transport, Air Liquide develops custom solutions to meet customers’ requirements – all while helping to improve productivity.

Among Air Liquide’s specialties is the utilisation of liquid nitrogen to chill produce quickly and effectively. There are several benefits to using cryogenic freezing methods, according to Fumie Hokao, food cryo specialist and Alex Young, food application specialist.

For example, liquid nitrogen can be sprayed into merchandise being chilled either from the top or the bottom, with both methods being used in the food and beverage industry. And conveniently, the process can be easily adapted to existing equipment.

“The customer may already have a freezer and want to increase throughput; they can add a small cryogenic freezer ahead of the other one to start the process and put the rest of the work into the main freezer. So, it’s a small footprint to increase productivity,” said Young.

Another benefit is that the gases have direct contact with the food.

If an ammonia chiller is being used in a mixer, for example, then users might be able to cool down the walls of the mixer but the surface of contact is limited compared to injecting the cooling agent directly in the food, as it would be the case with liquid nitrogen.

Some of the mainstays of cryogenic chilling are chicken nuggets and meat patties, which are popular with those who process fast-food products. Cryogenic freezing is also used for ice cream production and with fresh produce.

Young said one of the key benefits of using the method for fresh produce is the ability to lock in freshness and prevent weight reduction through moisture loss, and with produce being sold by weight, this creates an obvious benefit.

“Because it’s so cold it can snap freeze product quickly as opposed to mechanical freezing like a fridge or freezer,” he said.

“The faster you freeze the less loss you get because the surface is frozen straight away, and you don’t have moisture coming out which saves on any loss, which is generally through moisture.”

Young’s expertise is a good example of Air Liquide’s extensive technical knowledge through its worldwide network of food cryogenic specialists and research laboratories. Allowing the company to design cost-efficient cryogenic solutions that are customised to meet the specific needs of each manufacturer.

Air Liquide also offers an extensive range of cryogenic food processing equipment, in various models, widths and lengths, that can be perfectly matched with the food product, production volumes and amount of available floor space.

Cryogenic freezing equipment solutions are extremely flexible and can be easily customised based on the different characteristics of the food product.

Ice cream production presents another case study on the benefits of using liquid nitrogen in the cryogenic freezing process.

“Effectively the ice crystals in a food product are much smaller, the faster you freeze the smaller the crystal. If you freeze ice cream slowly it is grainy,” said Young.

With strawberries, for example, if they are snap frozen then they will retain more of their weight because the loss of moisture is limited.

“If you freeze a strawberry at home for instance and you thaw it out, weight loss would be significant due to ice crystals damaging the cellular structure of the fruit. Once thawed the cells content leaks away. With liquid nitrogen, once thawed out the fruit will be almost as good as fresh,” said Young.

This contributes to higher yields by rapidly locking in the product’s moisture content so that there is very little weight loss from dehydration during the freezing process.

This concept applies to many food products because faster freezing results in the formation of smaller ice crystals which causes less damage to the cellular structure and helps to retain the food product’s initial texture, colour, and flavour attributes.

The company’s gases and technologies are helping agricultural enterprises improve quality and productivity in a wide range of applications, from harvest protection to greenhouses and modified atmosphere packaging.

Also, controlling the atmosphere around a food product is key to extending product shelf life and maintaining an attractive customer presentation.

Their local experts understand the importance of gas flush packaging, a process that replaces package headspace with a beneficial gas or mixture of gases that will dramatically slow bacterial growth and oxidative reactions. This enables your product to last longer while reducing waste.

Young said Air Liquide is constantly working at find ways to improve food safety and quality by working to enhance food preservation, storage, processing, and transport.

The benefits of using liquid nitrogen in the cryogenic freezing process is a good example of how the company continually works to improve food production.

Every solution is specifically designed for each food processor using Air Liquide’s ALIGAL food grade gases, state-of-the-art application equipment and food cryogenic technical support services.

Air Liquide customers benefit from being able to produce value-added, high quality food products at a competitive cost.

Air Liquide will be attending the foodpro exhibition in Melbourne. You can meet them on stand L23.

Fumie Hokao, Technical Specialist in Industrial Cryogenic Freezing, will also hold a small talk on Cryogenic as part of Foodpro Smart Food Lounge, Sunday 23rd July, 1:00pm."
