ZeroAvia Emerges from Stealth with the Largest Zero-Emission Airplane Flying Today - PR Newswire,"Wed, 14 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL3plcm9hdmlhLWVtZXJnZXMtZnJvbS1zdGVhbHRoLXdpdGgtdGhlLWxhcmdlc3QtemVyby1lbWlzc2lvbi1haXJwbGFuZS1mbHlpbmctdG9kYXktMzAwOTAxMjg0Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"HOLLISTER, Calif., Aug. 14, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- In the latest effort to make aviation sustainable and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, ZeroAvia announced today its significant advancements in developing a zero-emission, hydrogen-fueled electric powertrain. The solution aims to deliver the same performance as a conventional aircraft engine, and much lower operating costs. ZeroAvia plans to start supplying its platform to commercial operators and aircraft manufacturers in 2022, initially targeting up to 500-mile regional flights in 10 to 20-seat fixed-wing aircraft.

ZeroAvia prototype is shown here powering a 6-seat Piper M-Class aircraft, already in flight tests from February 2019

""With land transport rapidly decarbonizing, fast-growing air transport is quickly becoming the leading emission source, so we must find ways to make aviation more sustainable,"" said Val Miftakhov, ZeroAvia Founder and CEO. ""Using hydrogen produced from local renewable energy is the most practical way to enable zero-emission aircraft of commercially meaningful size on traditional 300 to 500-mile regional missions. It will also be more economical than conventional turbine engines, or even the battery-based systems, on the total cost basis. We calculate the total costs of operating a ZeroAvia aircraft to be close to half of what it costs to fly a conventional turbine aircraft, due to lower fuel input costs, higher powertrain efficiency, and reduced maintenance costs.""

ZeroAvia was founded by serial cleantech entrepreneur Val Miftakhov, who is also an avid airplane and helicopter pilot. He previously founded and was the CEO of eMotorWerks, the leading smart grid electric vehicle charging company which was acquired in 2017. The core leadership team at ZeroAvia includes alumni from Tesla, BMW, NVIDIA, Zee Aero, Air Liquide, and SystemIQ, as well as other founding members of eMotorWerks.

The company is already flight testing its powertrain prototype in a Piper M-Class airframe, which can be viewed here and here . The Federal Aviation Administration issued an Experimental R&D Certificate to ZeroAvia's Piper M-Class R&D platform earlier this year. At a 2-ton takeoff weight and six seats in a business-class arrangement, it is currently the world's largest zero-emission aircraft flying without any fossil fuel support, according to the publicly available information. The aircraft has completed a variety of test flights, which validated key components and their integration into a complete powertrain system. These tests confirm the company's ""fuel"" economy and maximum power delivery targets.

""Aviation is the fastest-growing segment of transport emissions, set to nearly double by 2050 under current trends. Greenhouse gases released at altitude are particularly damaging, so it's vital to develop and scale zero-emission alternatives,"" said Jeremy Oppenheim, Founding Partner at SYSTEMIQ, an advisory and investment firm. SYSTEMIQ has been strategically supporting ZeroAvia's journey for over a year and recently completed a financial investment to accelerate R&D and European expansion. ""ZeroAvia's zero-emission drivetrain is the most promising, cost-competitive alternative to incumbent fossil-based technologies today. SYSTEMIQ is proud to be supporting ZeroAvia on their time-critical mission to decarbonize the aviation sector.""

ZeroAvia is initially targeting 500-mile flights to serve the short-haul and commuter air travel markets, which make up nearly half the commercial flights worldwide. Powered by ZeroAvia powertrains, smaller zero-emission aircraft will be able to achieve similar per-seat economics as today's large regional jets, allowing economical use of smaller local airports for point-to-point travel with virtually no security lines or delays, and a much more pleasant overall flying experience. In addition to passenger transport, the ZeroAvia powertrain will have applications across other use cases including cargo, air taxi, agriculture, as well as across the aircraft types, including manned and unmanned fixed-wing, rotorcraft, and more.

Starting in 2022, the ZeroAvia powertrain will offer operators a sustainable option for new aircraft made by established manufacturers where customers already purchase their aircraft. ZeroAvia will lease the drivetrain to customers and provide fuel and maintenance as part of its power-by-the-hour model, in which customers pay only for the hours that they use the drivetrain. This model emulates engine leasing options already popular in the aviation market.

""Zero-emission transportation is progressing rapidly to an inflection point,"" continued Miftakhov. ""The technology exists today to decarbonize commercial aviation in a meaningful way, and at ZeroAvia, we intend to lead that charge. With governments around the world calling for a shift towards clean transportation, and predictions that air travel frequency will increase in the future, it is imperative for us as an industry to ensure sustainable aviation is cleared for takeoff.""

About ZeroAvia: ZeroAvia is a leader in zero-emission aviation with the development of hydrogen fuel cell powertrain solutions to address a variety of markets, starting with 500-mile short-haul commercial flights for up to 20 passengers. Based in Hollister, California, ZeroAvia has secured an FAA Experimental Certificate, passed significant flight tests, and plans to launch commercial operations in 2022.

The range anxiety of driving a hydrogen car - POLITICO Europe,"Thu, 08 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvbGl0aWNvLmV1L2FydGljbGUvdGhlLXJhbmdlLWFueGlldHktb2YtZHJpdmluZy1hLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLWNhci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A car is fueled with gaseous hydrogen at the Frankfurt Auto Show IAA in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, on September 13, 2017 | Tobias Schwarz/AFP via Getty Images

The cars are clean, but a lack of fuel stations is crippling sales.

The destination was Amsterdam. The outcome: a forced return to Brussels out of fear we'd be stuck in the Dutch countryside with an empty hydrogen tank.

Driving a hydrogen car in Europe today is a high-risk endeavor thanks to a dearth of refueling stations that turns every longer trip into a blood pressure-raising planning exercise.

Hydrogen-powered cars are seen as a potential solution to the pollution emitted by gasoline and diesel engines, but barely any such cars have been sold. Sluggish sales numbers mean few want to invest in hydrogen refueling stations, and the lack of such stations makes buying a hydrogen car very risky.

Now, the industry is turning to the EU and to national governments in a bid to break that chicken-and-egg dilemma.

The next European Commission is expected to propose an update to the EU’s gas market to make room for green gases such as hydrogen. It's meant to help decarbonize various EU industries, including transport. National governments are also spending to promote more filling stations.

“It’s clear there will be no more cars and there's not going to be lower prices if there’s not going to be the necessary infrastructure making it possible to drive these cars,” Henrik Hololei, the director general of the Commission’s mobility and transport department, told POLITICO. “There is much more to be done in that respect and I hope it will also be high on the agenda of the next Commission.”

Hunting for hydrogen

At the end of 2018, there were 172 hydrogen stations in Europe, according to the International Energy Agency. Germany is by far the most developed market with 69 stations, followed by 23 in France, 20 in the U.K., 10 in Denmark, and a few each in Spain, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Finland, Latvia and the Czech Republic.

But that’s not nearly enough to enjoy an anxiety-free ride.

“If we want hydrogen mobility to complement properly battery mobility, there needs to be country-wide network deployment. We need help to do that,” said Pierre-Etienne Franc, vice president in charge of hydrogen in the French group Air Liquide, which operates 32 such stations in Europe.

“We want to stop running in a circle, we want to start building the infrastructure” — Jonas Cautaerts, business developer at DATS24

But it’s not just a question of numbers. The problem — as we found out in Rotterdam when our tank was half empty — is that some of the hydrogen stations that Air Liquide has partnered with require a special membership card, something we didn't have.

With enough hydrogen to drive to Amsterdam, but not enough to return to Brussels, we had to U-turn home.

Our ride was a €69,000 Hyundai Nexo, the second-generation hydrogen vehicle released by the South Korean carmaker last year. Hyundai, along with Japanese rivals Toyota and Honda, are among the few producers who still think there's a future for hydrogen, while other manufacturers move toward electric vehicles (EVs).

The Nexo drives like a conventional SUV, and gets 660 kilometers on a tank.

But there are only two refueling stations near Brussels — creating a dilemma for the industry: do more hydrogen cars spur the growth of stations or vice-versa?

“We want to stop running in a circle, we want to start building the infrastructure,” said Jonas Cautaerts, business developer at DATS24, the fuel business of Belgian retailer Colruyt Group.

The company has a hydrogen fueling station in Halle, about 20 kilometers south of Brussels, near one of its grocery stores — and is planning four more in Belgium as part of an EU-funded project.

That's where we had to fill up at night on our way back to Brussels after failing to do so in Rotterdam.

The station is an extension of a hydrogen production unit the company uses to fuel its car fleet as well as its forklifts. It sources its hydrogen through an on-site wind farm.

Green hydrogen

Although neither EVs nor hydrogen cars emit any pollution, the source of their fuel can be dirty. An EV recharged with electricity from a wind farm is clean, one recharged from a coal-fired power plant — not so much. The same applies to hydrogen.

Currently, the vast majority of hydrogen is made by breaking down natural gas, which generates CO2 as a byproduct. A cleaner version, dubbed ""green"" hydrogen, is made by using electricity to break apart water into hydrogen and oxygen, a process known as electrolysis. If the power is supplied by renewables, like at our station in Halle, it can be emission-free.

Hydrogen-backers argue that it's an attractive technology once the teething problems are resolved.

“It’s absolutely essential to embrace all alternative fuels. There is no silver bullet, there is not one solution” — Henrik Hololei, European Commission official

Both hydrogen and electric vehicles are vying for the mantle of the technology that will replace combustion engines, but so far EVs are running away with the game.

The lack of hydrogen stations undercuts one of the main arguments in favor of hydrogen over electric cars — that they're much faster to refuel, and so shouldn't have the range anxiety that is common for battery-powered car owners. The fast chargers now appearing at filling stations can bring an EV's charge to 80 percent within about 30 minutes, while a home charger can fully recharge a battery in about four hours. Filling a hydrogen car takes five minutes — if you can find a station.

That's had an impact on sales.

In the first quarter of this year, 91.5 percent of new car registrations were for gasoline and diesel, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. Battery-powered car sales were up 84 percent to 61,789 — accounting for 1.5 percent of car registrations.

That's not much, but hydrogen is doing significantly worse.

There were only 1,418 hydrogen vehicles on the road in Europe — including private cars and commercial fleets — as of the end of 2018, according to the International Energy Agency.

“I understand the dilemma of European carmakers who are now rushing from the conventionally-powered car to the electric car because there has been a lot of pressure on that,” Cautaerts said.

“But they should have a much wider picture and hydrogen should be part of that.”

Changing that would require a huge investment in fueling stations.

There is some movement, but it's still small considering the scale of the market. Hydrogen Mobility Europe, a pan-European project supported by EU money, said this week it has deployed close to 500 hydrogen cars and 30 hydrogen refueling stations since 2013. Its goal is 49 fueling stations and 1,400 hydrogen cars and vans by 2022.

This €170 million demonstration project is co-funded with €67 million from the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking, a public-private partnership. The goal is to invest €1.3 billion by 2020.

Franc, the Air Liquide executive, estimates that once a country the size of France or Germany has 1,000 hydrogen-fueling stations — enough to supply about 500,000 cars — it would no longer be a problem for consumers to opt for hydrogen instead of petrol or diesel vehicles. That would require about €2 billion in investments, he said.

Getting that cash is the problem.

“It costs such an amount of money that it cannot be taken by Air Liquide alone or by a car manufacturer. It needs to be a shared risk with some mitigation by European policymakers,” Cautaerts said.

It’s a challenge for carmakers, too.

“We would have something that is comfortable with a number of maybe 5,000 stations across Europe … You have to have one or two stations in the vicinity of where you live,” said Jan Burdinski, executive director of Hyundai Motor Europe.

That's why they're hoping Brussels and national capitals will come to hydrogen's rescue.

“It’s absolutely essential to embrace all alternative fuels,” Hololei said. “There is no silver bullet, there is not one solution.”

As for us, although we didn't make it to Amsterdam that evening, we at least made it home.

Maybe next time we'll reach Amsterdam — hydrogen stations permitting.

California's 40 Hydrogen Stations Push Toward Fuel-Cell Viability - Ward's Auto,"Fri, 09 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhcmRzYXV0by5jb20vMTAtYmVzdC1lbmdpbmVzL2NhbGlmb3JuaWEtcy00MC1oeWRyb2dlbi1zdGF0aW9ucy1wdXNoLXRvd2FyZC1mdWVsLWNlbGwtdmlhYmlsaXR50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This is the fourth in a series of articles highlighting powertrain trends as the Wards 10 Best Engines competition celebrates its 25th year.

General Motors built the world’s first fuel-cell vehicle. Based on a 1966 GMC van, the Electrovan offered seating for five people but a meager amount of cargo space due to the oversized fuel-cell components.

Almost half a century later, Wards named an FCV to its 10 Best Engines list for the first time, characterizing the 2015 Hyundai Tucson Fuel Cell CUV and its 100-kW propulsion system as “ahead of the curve.” More recently, the Wards judges recognized both Honda (2018 Clarity Fuel Cell) and Hyundai (2019 Nexo) for building world-class FCV powertrains.

More than 50 years have passed since the Electrovan made its mark on automotive history. Now, FCV innovation is accelerating as hard as a 16-year-old with a freshly minted driver’s license out for a joyride in a Tesla Model S Performance set to Ludicrous Mode.

Take, for example, the 2019 Hyundai Nexo, which offers 5-passenger seating, 380 miles (612 km) of driving range and a hydrogen refueling time of approximately five minutes. It is a no-compromise FCV wrapped in an appealing crossover design that provides the passenger and cargo space that people want.

“Globally, (Hyundai) is all-in on fuel-cell vehicles,” Hyundai spokesperson Miles Johnson tells Wards. “Vice Chairman Eui-Sun Chung plans to build 500,000 FCVs by 2030.”

Infrastructure to fuel FCVs must grow rapidly to keep pace with vehicle development and deployment. This summer, California is one of two U.S. states with retail hydrogen fueling stations, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. And they’re all located in the Golden State except for a single retail outlet in Mapunapuna, Hawaii, near Honolulu. Opened by Servco Pacific Inc., it services Mirai FCV drivers who lease their cars through the company’s Toyota dealership.

Most of California’s retail fueling stations are located in the Los Angeles and Bay Area regions. However, network expansion is slowly connecting the dots. Today, 40 stations are open, and FCV owners can road-trip from San Diego to Lake Tahoe with a reasonable expectation, though no guarantee, that they will find hydrogen fuel. Another 24 hydrogen stations are at some stage of the permit, planning, construction and commissioning process.

California Fuel Cell Partnership Green dots are stations in operation, while yellow dots are stations under construction or in development.

As the hydrogen infrastructure expands, so will consumer adoption of FCVs. Toyota’s introduction of the Mirai triggered brisk growth in FCV sales. According to the California Fuel Cell Partnership (CaFCP), FCV sales in the U.S. rose from 112 vehicles in 2015 to 1,082 in 2016. They doubled again in 2017, to 2,298 units, but have since leveled off despite a redesign and greater availability of the Honda Clarity Fuel Cell as well as the debut of the Hyundai Nexo.

Don’t assume, however, that FCV demand and sales are stagnating. Gilbert Castillo, senior group manager-Alternative Vehicle and Advanced Vehicle Strategy for Hyundai Motor America, says the company is selling Nexos as soon as they arrive on dealership lots.

“Right now, (we have) a production capacity limitation,” Castillo tells Wards. “Demand globally is strong, especially in Korea and Europe. Next year, we expect to have more volume to sell, but (then) we are bumping up against a station limitation issue.”

Globally, California leads in terms of hydrogen fueling infrastructure development. Nevertheless, demand sometimes outstrips hydrogen supply.

In 2017, the California Air Resources Board identified potential gaps in hydrogen production capacity. In 2018, the California Energy Commission awarded grant funding to add two tons of renewable hydrogen to the state’s growing network of fueling stations. In 2019, hiccups in production and distribution caused frustrating shortages of fuel in the state.

Despite such challenges, leaders in California, Asia and Europe remain bullish on FCVs. Wards Intelligence predicts that the global hydrogen FCV market will grow to 300,000 light vehicles by 2030.

“The years 2020 to 2030 will be for hydrogen what the 1990s were for solar and wind,” says Pierre-Etienne Franc, vice president-Advanced Business and Technologies for Air Liquide, a leader in hydrogen fuel production, in a quote published in the 2018 Annual Evaluation of Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle Deployment & Hydrogen Fuel Station Network Development by CARB.

GM GM's 1966 Electrovan.

China also is aggressively pursuing the technology, which already powers some of the nation’s trucks and buses. At a June 2019 conference in China, Wan Gang, vice chairman of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, urged the country to speed development of hydrogen fueling infrastructure to support commercial FCV applications.

Meanwhile, in California, then-governor Jerry Brown issued an executive order in January 2018 to double the state’s network of hydrogen stations from the planned 100 by 2023 to a total of 200 by 2025. Furthermore, Brown set a target of 5 million zero-emission vehicles (ZEV) on the state’s roads by 2030.

Based on these governmental actions, the CaFCP ambitiously predicts improvements in the availability of renewable hydrogen fuel, the re-fueling experience and cost reductions that make FCVs more competitive with gasoline vehicles.

Fuel cells, however, could face a significant challenge from battery-electric vehicles.

Brown’s executive order also called for dramatic increases in BEV sales and the charging station network that supports them. At the same time, the latest DC fast charger public recharging stations are capable of delivering up to 500 kW to compatible vehicles, replenishing long-range battery packs to 80% in as little as 15 minutes.

California Fuel Cell Partnership

Could faster BEV recharging through an expanded charging station network negatively impact growth of FCVs?

Hyundai’s Castillo doesn’t think so, explaining that daily DC fast charging is not how BEV owners recharge their vehicles, and even when that solution is used it cannot compete with the Nexo’s five-minute refueling time for 380 miles of range. Furthermore, Castillo says people who do not own their own homes have trouble recharging BEVs, making FCVs more appealing to renters.

With regard to future vehicle propulsion systems, is this a Betamax vs. VHS moment for the transportation industry? Likely not, as both BEVs and FCVs appear to have distinct advantages.

One thing is almost certain, however. More of these alternative power sources likely will find their way onto the Wards 10 Best Engines & Propulsion Systems list in the 25 years to come."
Spain now has 900 unmanned petrol stations - PetrolPlaza.com,"Tue, 13 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiJmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBldHJvbHBsYXphLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIyNjky0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Spain now has 900 unmanned petrol stations

7.5% of service stations are unmanned, although savings for drivers can be as high as 16%.

Last update: August 13, 2019

Author: PetrolPlaza Correspondent Pablo Plaza

Out of the 11,646 petrol stations in Spain, only 882 are fully unmmaned, accounting for 7.5% of the total. According to the latest study by the National Commission on Markets and Competition (CNMC), it would be advisable for both the State and the autonomous regions to eliminate requirements or limitations that ""are not really necessary"" on automated petrol stations in view of their potential to reduce fuel prices.

The reduction in the number of personnel and the smaller space occupied by unmanned petrol stations would contribute to their offer being cheaper than traditional sites. However, the opposition of both the traditional operators and the authorities has resulted in their expansion in the Spanish territory being much slower than in the other countries of the European Union, where they have grown by up to 16%.

According to a study carried out in the Community of Madrid, the price difference between traditional service stations and automatic petrol stations reached a maximum of 16.9% for diesel A, and 12.3% for petrol 95 between 2012-2016.

Companies such as Ballenoil, Naftë, Petroprix, Petrocar, Plenoil, Elc24h, Aneroil or Autonet&oil are battling to expand their presence in the Iberian Peninsula, although most of them are concentrated in a few Spanish autonomous communities: Catalonia, Valencia, Andalusia and Madrid would account for 72% of this type. In Galicia, Cantabria, Asturias, Navarre, La Rioja, Aragon, Extremadura and the Balearic Islands its presence is almost non-existent.

The document signed in Aqtau was supposed to finally clarify for all five Caspian states -- Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Iran, Russia, and Turkmenistan -- how the water and, more importantly, the seabed was to be used.



Use of the seabed included construction of undersea pipelines, such as the Trans-Caspian Pipeline (TCP), a project to bring natural gas from Turkmenistan to Europe that has been on the drawing board since the mid-1990s.



The topic of the TCP project to bring gas from Turkmenistan across the Caspian Sea to Azerbaijan was certain to receive attention at the Avaza forum. And it did. But not the sort of attention that would inspire much confidence that the TCP would be built anytime soon.

Long-Time Coming

Plans for construction of a pipeline across the Caspian have been on the drawing board for about a quarter of a century and, for most of that time, Moscow and Tehran have demonstrated they were not going to support the project.



The Russian and Iranian representatives at Avaza made it clear their positions have not changed.



In his speech in Avaza, Behrouz Namdari of Iran’s National Gas Company said that “Iran is against any trans-Caspian pipelines.” Namdari suggested any party wishing to ship gas from the eastern side of the Caspian Sea to the western side would be better off shipping the gas through Iran’s pipeline network, neglecting to mention how that network is poorly developed and could not yet handle large volumes of gas.



Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was also in Avaza and said in his speech that he was “absolutely convinced that all major projects in the Caspian Sea should undergo a thorough and impartial environmental evaluation involving specialists from all Caspian countries.”



Sergei Prikhodko, the first deputy prime minister in Medvedev’s government, told journalists in Moscow just hours before the Caspian Economic Forum opened that the Convention On The Legal Status Of The Caspian Sea ensured the right “of each of the countries located on the Caspian Sea to take part in a comprehensive environmental assessment of cross-border maritime activities” that could affect the sea’s environment.



At the Caspian summit in Aqtau in 2018, Turkmen President Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev both used their speeches to stress how important the ecology of the Caspian Sea was to their countries and pledged that both were committed to environmental safety when carrying out any projects.

But the remarks from Medvedev and similar remarks at Avaza from Namdari, indicate Russia and Iran continue to hold out ecological concerns as a means to delay construction of the TCP, a position Moscow and Tehran have used for some two decades to cast doubt on the realization of the TCP project.



There have always been suspicions that Russia and Iran were less interested in the Caspian’s ecology and more interested in supplying their own gas to Europe.



Namdari was perhaps more candid in remarks he made to the Russian publication Economika Segodnya, when he said, ""We are not interested in creating competitors.""

There was, however, also support for the TCP at Avaza.



The European Union’s special representative for Central Asia, Peter Burian, said at the forum that “I am happy to state that in 2019, [EU officials] have intensified our discussion with Turkmenistan on various aspects of our energy cooperation.”

EU Market

The EU hopes to receive some 30 billion cubic meters of Turkmen gas from the TCP as part of the Southern Gas Corridor initiative that aims to augment and diversify suppliers of gas to EU markets, at the same time lessening EU dependence on Russian gas.



The pro-Turkmen government website Orient.tm reported on August 13 that representatives of a group of European companies -- Edison Technologies, MMEC Mannesmann, Air Liquide Global E&C Solutions -- and the Chinese company Sinopec met with Turkmen Foreign Minister Rashid Meredov and the presidential adviser on oil and gas matters, Yashigeldy Kakaev, to discuss construction of the TCP.

The same source reported the general director of Edison Technologies, Edison Kasapoglu, said, “We have united in a consortium, we can now realize such a bold project as a pipeline from Turkmenistan to Azerbaijan along the bottom of the Caspian Sea.”



Legally, there should never have been a problem for Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan to agree on constructing a pipeline to bring Turkmen gas across the Caspian to Azerbaijan where it could be pumped into Azerbaijani pipelines headed to Europe.



The signing of last year's Caspian Convention supported this, noting that two littoral countries with a common border could agree to construct an undersea pipeline, seemingly clearing the way for construction of the TCP to connect Turkmenistan with Azerbaijan.



But problems appeared almost immediately.



Less than one week after the signing of the Caspian convention, the Russian Foreign Ministry’s ambassador at large, Igor Bratchikov, was already saying that the construction of the TCP would actually require the consent of all five Caspian littoral countries.



By the end of August 2018, Azerbaijani President Aliyev said if Turkmenistan was so interested in the TCP it should be willing to put up some money toward realizing the project, the same way the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) had provided financing for the Trans-Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline (TANAP).



TANAP, incidentally, would be the logical pipeline to carry the Turkmen gas on the last leg to Europe, though there is also the proposed White Stream gas pipeline that could bring Turkmen gas across the Black Sea from Georgia to Romania and Ukraine.



But Turkmenistan’s policy is to make its gas available at its border to anyone who connects a pipeline to Turkmenistan. With the exception of the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline that Turkmengaz is managing, Turkmenistan does not construct pipelines past its border.



And Turkmenistan is in the midst of the worst economic crisis in the country’s nearly 28-year history as an independent state. It would be difficult for Ashgabat to find money for the TCP unless the government was prepared to tap into the reportedly large reserve fund it has in Germany and other foreign banks.



It is also worth considering the legitimacy of Russian and Iranian public concerns about environmental safety in the Caspian.



Moscow and Tehran say they are worried about possible ecological damage caused by undersea pipelines. But there already are undersea pipelines in the Caspian Sea that run from Caspian oil and gas fields to both Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan.



In fact the twin pipelines -- one for oil and the other for gas -- from Kazakhstan’s offshore Kashagan field started leaking due to the effects of sulfur gas on the pipes in September 2013, shortly after production finally started at the field and both pipelines had to be replaced at a cost of some $4 billion.

Ecological Risks

Russia and Iran have never complained about the pipelines running from the Shah Deniz 2 field some 85 kilometers to the Azerbaijani shore, or from the Kashagan field some 95 kilometers to Kazakhstan’s shore.



They also have never complained about the damage that resulted from Kazakhstan’s leaking pipelines in 2013.



It is apparently only the pipelines that connect two Caspian countries, in this case Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan, that elicit objections from Moscow and Tehran.



It will be interesting to see what happens if Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan move on a decade-old plan to construct an undersea oil pipeline to bring Kazakh oil to Azerbaijan, where it would be loaded into pipelines heading west toward Europe.

Further, Russia has constructed gas pipelines -- Blue Stream and TurkStream pipelines -- from its shores across the bottom of the Black Sea to Turkey, and Russia built Nord Stream 1 and is working on Nord Stream 2 gas pipelines along the bottom of the Gulf of Finland and Baltic Sea to Germany. All these pipelines are technically more difficult to construct than the proposed TCP.



So Russian experts should already know that the TCP poses no greater ecological risk than Blue Stream, TurkStream, or the Nord Stream pipelines do.



Namdari’s comments about not creating a competitor for gas markets -- in this case the particularly lucrative European gas market -- seem more likely to be the reason for Russian and Iranian objections to construction of the TCP.



But the loophole the two governments see in having all five Caspian countries agree on the ecological safety of cross-border projects promises to delay construction of the TCP from Turkmenistan to Azerbaijan for the foreseeable future.



There are some people in the West who say if leading technical and ecological experts, say from the EU or the United States, are involved in planning and constructing the TCP, and Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan are satisfied with safety guarantees, there should be no problem building the pipeline and no place for Russian or Iranian objections.



But Moscow and Tehran’s interpretation of the Convention On The Legal Status Of The Caspian Sea requires that Russia and Iran sign off on ecological safety studies before construction of transborder pipelines can start.



If, for example, Russia claims its experts are in no way inferior to Western experts, and that Russia has studied the Caspian biosphere for longer and in greater detail than Western experts, which would be difficult to argue, then it becomes a matter of who polices the Caspian Sea.



The answer to that is clear: the Russian Navy controls the Caspian and if Moscow does not want something constructed in the Caspian, ultimately there is no one in any position to oppose that.

Why industrial gases are important in fish farming - FOOD Magazine - Australia,"Fri, 16 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2RtYWcuY29tLmF1L3doeS1pbmR1c3RyaWFsLWdhc2VzLWFyZS1pbXBvcnRhbnQtaW4tZmlzaC1mYXJtaW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Fish is a nourishing, healthy food that is popular throughout the world. However, as the planet’s population grows, fish stocks in some oceans are dwindling. One way to address this shortage is fish farms. Popular in Europe, especially Nordic countries, aquaculture also occurs throughout Australia – from the tropical north to the more temperate climes of Tasmania.

Like any commercial venture, there are many facets to make it a successful enterprise. When it comes to fish farming, an essential ingredient are various industrial gases, which have many applications in aquaculture – from hatching the eggs through to when the final product is shipped for sale.

Air Liquide is a gas specialist that has a lot of information and experience when it comes to fish farming. Its Tasmanian sales representative, Grant Stingel, works closely with the industry, not only as a supplier of gases, but also giving advice on how much, what type and how often a certain gas needs to be applied to the various production processes.

The most prolific gas used in fish farming is oxygen. There are two main reasons it’s needed. The most obvious is to sustain the life of the fish as they hatch and are grown. The other is a little more interesting.

“During the production of farmed fish, one of the high cost inputs is the food,” said Stingel. “It can cost up to $2,000 a tonne or more depending on the species and feed type.

Maintaining a stable level of oxygen in the tank increases the fishes’ metabolism, which in turn increases the conversion of food into fish mass. So the Feed Conversion Rate (FCR) reduces, meaning lower feed costs per kilogram of fish.

“And if you’re talking tonnes of fish, you’re talking tonnes of food per day. In the larger aquaculture systems, maintaining stable oxygen levels in the tanks will increase production. If you can increase the growth of the fish each day by adding oxygen, this reduces the time the fish are in the water, which in turn increases efficiencies within the whole production cycle.

“Typically, modern land-based aquaculture farms use what is called a Recirculating Aquaculture System (RAS). This is essentially a water treatment plant to circulate and reuse the water. This plant uses pumps to push water through a series of filters to help purify the water before going back into the fish tanks,” said Stingel. “Oxygen is also used in this process to produce ozone to sterilise the water.

“In the inlet water to each of the ponds or tanks, the oxygen level is elevated by injecting oxygen, typically using a pressurised oxygen dissolver, to 120 to 140 per cent of normal saturation, depending on the biomass. This ensures that the respiration demands from the fish are taken care of and a stable growing environment is achieved.”

There are other applications where oxygen is necessary. Just before the fish are harvested, whether in ponds or sea cages, higher doses of oxygen are needed due to the fish being crowded into a small amount of water within the harvest area. This ensures that the fish are not as stressed before processing, giving a better end product.

Also, in some farms, oxygen is used to supersaturate baths of water to treat the fish for pest and disease, such as sea lice.

With all the oxygen being used, what are the costs involved? Not as much as you would think, said Stingel.

“Oxygen is typically only about one or two per cent of the cost of your production but it’s very important,” he said. “It is an essential element to the fish farming process. In some cases, oxygen can be seen as just a commodity, but oxygen used efficiently can also add benefits to your production.

“Oxygen supply to fish farms is essential so we have engineering support available,” he said. “As far as technical support, we can calculate how much oxygen you will need for the quantity of fish in each system. Based on the calculated oxygen required, we also offer advice on the oxygen dissolving system best suited for the application. Measuring the efficiency of your existing oxygenation system is also something Air Liquide can offer.”

Other gases are also used once the fish have been processed. Oxygen goes from being the hero to the enemy once the fish are ready to be sent to Australian supermarkets or exported.

“After harvest, we use other industrial gases for packaging fish products,” said Stingel. “Some aquaculture companies use Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP). This is a mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide injected and sealed inside the trays often seen on the shelf at your local supermarket.”

The carbon dioxide inhibits bacterial growth, which will increase shelf life for the end product.

The nitrogen is to displace the oxygen and also maintain the package integrity so that it looks good on the supermarket shelf.

Another industrial gas used in the processing phase is liquid nitrogen, which is used to snap freeze the fish products by sending it through a freezing tunnel, which sprays the gas onto the product. This achieves a better quality product when thawed. This is because when a product is snap frozen, the cell structure of the food is maintained, meaning when thawed, the fish not only looks good, but tastes fresh.

“Even when it comes to the presentation of the food we can help. For example, dry ice produced from liquid carbon dioxide is used to add a bit of theatre at serving counters in restaurants or markets,” said Stingel. “As the dry ice thaws, vapour is formed, giving off a nice smoke effect. Dry ice is also good for keeping the product cold and fresh.”

In almost every stage in the production of fish in aquaculture systems there is potential to use an industrial gas of some type whether it is oxygen, nitrogen, argon or CO2. But the use of the various gases doesn’t stop there. Air Liquide can also provide gases for other, practical uses.

“The other application for industrial gases is for maintaining plant and equipment,” said Stingel. “With quite a lot of machinery involved in the process, you will also need oxygen and acetylene for heating and cutting, argon gas mixtures for welding, and LPG for heating and maybe also powering forklifts.”"
"Turkmenistan: Welcome to Awaza, or No Trespassing - Eurasianet","Tue, 13 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vZXVyYXNpYW5ldC5vcmcvdHVya21lbmlzdGFuLXdlbGNvbWUtdG8tYXdhemEtb3Itbm8tdHJlc3Bhc3NpbmfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The president’s flamboyant return to state television after rumors of his early demise helped bring heaps of attention to his country. This came just in time for Turkmenistan’s biggest event this year – the inaugural Caspian Economic Forum.

The kind of attention garnered, however, strains the old line about how “there is no such thing as bad publicity.” Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov is now vying with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un (not to speak of U.S. President Donald Trump) for the title of most ridiculed world leader. Riffing on the president’s recent summer antics, popular U.S.-based comedians John Oliver and Trevor Noah have familiarized their fans with Turkmenistan in ways that Ashgabat could only find embarrassing.

Less comically, CNN published a special report under the headline: ""A hermit nation ruled by an egomaniac: Is Turkmenistan on the brink of collapse?""

State TV continued to provide fresh footage of Berdymukhamedov over the past week, albeit in a slightly less eccentric key. In these clips, he was seen leading a cabinet meeting and taking a pleasure cruise on the Caspian.

But his appearance alongside Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov on August 11 was perhaps his first interaction in months with somebody not in his inner circle.

Borissov was among the most high-profile attendees of the Caspian Economic Forum, which played out over the weekend. He sent out ambivalent messages by asserting that Sofia is exploring ways to import natural gas from Turkmenistan, while noting that the option of a Trans-Caspian Pipeline was likely off the menu because of environmental concerns.

Bulgarian Public Works Minister Petya Avramova was quoted by Bulgarian media as saying that she is involved in discussions to buy Turkmen gas through swap transactions that would see Russia playing the intermediary. This is an old export sale model for Turkmenistan and would be rendered possible in this instance by completion of the second strand of the TurkStream route.

Turkmen-Russian relations are going through a very rosy patch at the moment. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev made it back to Turkmenistan to attend the forum, for his second visit since May. He was joined by Rustam Minnikhanov, president of Russia's Tatarstan region.

Other guests included the prime ministers of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. They all met with Berdymukhamedov, as did Iran's Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri. Side meetings between many of the politicians in town took place as well.

Despite Borissov’s apparent green opposition to the Trans-Caspian Pipeline, Peter Burian, the European Union's Special Representative for Central Asia, did offer some potentially positive comments. He said the EU had ""resumed negotiations with Turkmenistan on participation in the financing of a Trans-Caspian Pipeline,” according to Russia's state-owned Vesti Finance.

Ashgabat-based, government-friendly news website Orient reported on August 13 that representatives from a Euro-Chinese consortium – which included Edison Technologies GmbH, MMEC Mannesmann GmbH, Air Liquide Global E&C Solutions and SINOPEC Engineering – met with Berdymukhamedov’s trusted advisor on energy issues, Yagshigeldy Kakayev, to discuss building the Trans-Caspian Pipeline. The consortium’s proposal would see it laying 300 kilometers of pipeline, design and build gas treatment plants and compressor stations and all kinds of other essential infrastructure. No estimate is provided as to what all this would cost.

Where Russia used to be the most intractable opponent of this initiative, Iran is now making unfavorable noises. Behrouz Namdari, an executive with the National Iranian Gas Company, or NIGC, was quoted by the Associated Press as saying ""Iran is against any trans-Caspian pipelines. The construction of a trans-Caspian pipeline could inflict serious damage to the environment.” It was unclear from the reporting by AP and RIA-Novosti, which also conveyed the remarks, what role Namdari occupies in the NIGC.

The Caspian Economic Forum was held on the first anniversary of the signing – on August 12, 2018 – of the Convention on the Legal Status of the Caspian Sea. It was that document that was meant to serve as the green light – and this remains a contested matter – for mooted regional projects like the Trans-Caspian Pipeline. But the convention is facing scrutiny in the Iranian parliament, with the disputed status of the sea border serving as the main sticking point.

Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan have ratified the deal, and Russia will soon join, according to Medvedev, but Tehran has yet to do so. Iranian analysts have indicated their legislature may ratify only once boundaries are agreed.

The sea border issue is also a sticking point for Baku. Speaking about the Azeri-Turkmen seabed border, Bahram Huseynov, vice president of the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan, or SOCAR, told the Times of Israel that ""no concrete steps have been made yet and it’s too early to discuss specifics.”

Overall, the Caspian forum, which was held in the hyper-developed but under-visited Awaza tourist zone, was high on expressions of intent but low on firm outcomes.

Sergei Prikhodko, first deputy chief of staff in the Russian government, declared that three national energy champions – Rosneft, Lukoil and Gazprom – were all interested in developing Turkmenistan's hydrocarbon fields. This is hardly news though.

The only agreement that was publicly discussed was Medvedev’s sale of limousines made by the Russian government-owned firm Aurus. Russia state TV captured the moment when Medvedev, looking for all the world like a car showroom salesman, clinched the deal to palm off a few models to Berdymukhamedov, whose possession of a now presumably vast fleet of exotic automobiles is in keeping with his overall tinpot dictator shtick.

Xinhua reported that representatives of China Development Bank, Huawei, PetroChina and CNPC attended the forum. These are all highly familiar names.

The business leaders who attended the forum were likewise a cast of Turkmenistan’s regular visitors. Berdymukhamedov’s fellow cycling enthusiast Igor Makarov of Russian privately owned energy company ARETI showed up, as did Turkish tycoon Ahmet Çalik of Çalik Holdings.

As RFE/RL’s Turkmen service reported on August 11, notably absent were regular Turkmen citizens themselves. Radio Azatlyk reported that some were ordered to leave their hotel rooms in Awaza, while movements of resident in the nearby town of Turkmenbashi were restricted. Residents of Turkmenbashi were also instructed to refrain from sacrificing animals for the Eid al-Adha holiday, which is being marked this week, in the interests of maintaining hygiene."
Costs Check Growth of Fuel-Cell Infrastructure - Ward's Auto,"Thu, 22 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhcmRzYXV0by5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS9jb3N0cy1jaGVjay1ncm93dGgtZnVlbC1jZWxsLWluZnJhc3RydWN0dXJl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TOKYO – It is a slog, no doubt, but several industrial and industrializing nations are putting in place a fueling infrastructure for fuel-cell vehicles.

“The infrastructure issue is progressively being solved,” Pierre-Etienne Franc, co-secretary of the Hydrogen Council, tells Wards in an interview. “But we also need more cars on the road.”

Franc, more bullish than most, thinks a global network of 10,000 stations is reachable by 2030. A more conservative forecast was presented at the International Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Expo in March by Fuji Keizai, a leading Japanese market-research organization, which predicted a total of 5,500 stations in the same timeframe, still a substantial increase over an estimated 290 today.

Japan, the current leader, has 109 stations in operation with another 51 planned by the end of 2020. Looking forward to 2025, the government’s roadmap calls for 320 stations nationwide and five years later, in 2030, a total of 900.

Germany’s total has grown to 74 with an additional 28 in various stages of planning or construction. Throughout the rest of Europe, 31 stations are operational with an additional 21 scheduled to come on stream, bringing the region’s current total to 105.

Backed by H2 Mobility Germany, a joint venture comprising leading European energy companies and Daimler, Germany has set a target of 400 stations by the end of 2023 and 900 by 2030.

In the U.S., California, the long-time leader, continues to advance a statewide program with 40 stations now open for business and another 24 in the works. By the end of 2020, the state plans to have 64 stations in operation.

Fuji Keizai estimates the U.S. will have 250 hydrogen stations operating by 2025, half in California.

Elsewhere, South Korea had 14 stations in operation in 2018 with plans to open a total of 100 by 2022. China, the newest major market entry, is racing full-speed forward with a series of national and regional initiatives. China earlier this year had 15 operating stations with another 33 in planning.

Franc, who when not serving the 60-member Hydrogen Council is vice president of the hydrogen business unit at Air Liquide, acknowledges it will be an uphill challenge to establish a hydrogen fueling infrastructure, in part because of significant upfront costs.

While costs differ by country, region and station size, Franc reports the current cost to construct a hydrogen fueling station is between $1 million and $2 million. In Japan, that number is believed to be upwards of ¥250 million ($2.4 million) and probably closer to ¥319 million ($3 million) based on the government’s roadmap.

This compares to an estimated $200,000 for an ultra-fast-charging electric-vehicle station equipped with a single 350-kW charger.

The International Council on Clean Transportation says installation costs (separate from hardware costs) come down as more chargers are installed at a particular site.

In Europe, Ionity, a JV between BMW, Daimler, Ford and Volkswagen, has set a 2020 target of 400 ultra-fast-charging EV stations and approximately 2,400 chargers, each able to operate at 350-kW levels.

“Compared to fast-charging stations for battery-electric cars, hydrogen stations are more expensive but also have far greater capacity,” Franc says, adding that a hydrogen station “can refuel between 100 and 300 cars per day, (as) it takes only three to five minutes to refuel per car.

“With batteries, the charging operation grows in a linear manner as the number of cars increases. The initial investment will be small, but as volumes and momentum grow, so does the investment,” he says.

“I am unaware of anyone who’s said that fast-charging stations can be profitable even when fully utilized, but I may be wrong.”

Franc, who speaks on behalf of the Hydrogen Council, nevertheless concedes hydrogen and electric must complement each other to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions."
Turkmenistan is studying the project of the European consortium for the production of methanol from natural gas | Energy - TURKMENPORTAL,"Wed, 21 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3R1cmttZW5wb3J0YWwuY29tL2VuL2Jsb2cvMjExNzYvdHVya21lbmlzdGFuLWlzLXN0dWR5aW5nLXRoZS1wcm9qZWN0LW9mLXRoZS1ldXJvcGVhbi1jb25zb3J0aXVtLWZvci10aGUtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1vZi1tZXRoYW5vbC1mcm9tLW5hdHVyYWwtZ2Fz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An investment project for the construction of a plant for the production of methanol from natural gas in Turkmenistan was proposed by a consortium of European companies Edison Technologies, MMEC Mannesmann GmbH, Air Liquide Global E&C Solutions and the Chinese company SINOPEC Engineering Group.

According to the official website of the oil and gas complex of Turkmenistan, this large-scale project was presented at the first Caspian economic forum in AVAZA.

According to the information, methanol is widely used in the production of chemical products, plastic, plywood, paints, varnish, cosmetics, and liquid energy resources, and methanol is in growing demand in the world market. The main consumers of methanol are Asian and European countries, mainly Germany and China. The reason for the increasing demand for methanol is also due to the fact that it serves as a liquid energy resource as a transport fuel. Expanding the use of methanol in the chemical industry will lead to the fact that in the future it will become the main raw material in this industry.

Turkmenistan ranks fourth in the world in natural gas reserves after Russia, Iran, and Qatar. The energy strategy implemented in the country provides for the diversification of the use of natural gas, including for the production of a variety of finished products of gas chemistry. So, in June this year in Akhal province a new industrial complex was put into operation — a plant for the production of synthetic gasoline ECO-93 from natural gas, the information says."

The consortium includes Germany's Edison Technologies, MMEC Mannesmann GmbH and Air Liquide Global E&C Solutions and Chinese SINOPEC Engineering Group.

During the meeting with the Deputy Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers of Turkmenistan Myratgeldi Meredov and Advisor to the President of Turkmenistan on oil and gas Yagshigeldy Kakaev on the fields of the First Caspian Economic Forum hosted in Avaza last week, the representative of the Consortium Edison Kasapoglu said that Turkmenistan has bolstered its position in the international energy market and expanded the geography of energy cooperation and dialogue in the recent years.

Favourable Investment Climate

Kasapoglu also noted that Turkmenistan's favorable geopolitical location, the richest hydrocarbons deposits of the country, the diversification of its energy export routes and the policy of industrialization actively pursued by the President of Turkmenistan Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov creates attractive climate and platform for large-scale foreign investments.

On behalf of the consortium, Kasapoglu proposed a grandiose investment project to build 300 km Trans-Caspian gas pipeline between Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan along the bottom of the Caspian Sea. The project also includes drilling of the required number of turnkey gas wells, and design and construction of gas treatment plants and compressor stations to supply purified gas to the Trans-Caspian pipeline.

The businessman stated that the European Union shows great interest in the construction of the Trans-Caspian gas pipeline and the supply of Turkmen natural gas to the EU market to enhance the energy security of the European continent.

""After laying the Trans-Caspian gas pipeline to the shores of Azerbaijan, Turkmen gas can be delivered to Turkey either via the Trans-Anatolian gas pipeline and then to Europe or through a new route with access to the borders of the European Union in accordance with the requirements and proposals of all neighboring countries,"" Kasapoglu said.

He also noted that the Consortium is ready to invest its financial resources in the project and return its investments with commercial gas which will be exported to Europe upon commissioning of the pipeline in the future.

The Consortium said it has carried out preliminary technical studies for the Trans-Caspian pipeline project and conducted extensive market research for natural gas demand in the European market.

Environmental Compliance

""When laying the gas pipeline along the bottom of the Caspian Sea, the company will strictly comply with environmental requirements and standards enshrined in international treaties and the Framework Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Caspian Sea,"" Kasapoglu assured, adding that bathymetric, geophysical and geotechnical studies, as well as assessment of the corresponding seabed profiles, elimination of free spans and obstacles along the pipeline route, will be taken into account when designing the subsea gas pipeline construction.

""The requirements for buoyancy control, maintainability, protection against internal and external corrosion, protection against further dangers and damages will also be met,"" he stressed. ""The consortium will focus on assessing all types of potential environmental risks associated with the planning and implementation of the underwater pipeline"".

The Consortium intends to achieve environmental goals by conducting special studies and seminars on environmental impact assessment at each stage of the project. Kasapoglu believes such steps can be taken to carry out international expertise and thereby satisfy the Caspian countries regarding environmental and ecological safety of the sea basin.

The representative of the Consortium said that his team is committed to mutually beneficial cooperation with Turkmenistan as a reliable partner and energy supplier.

""We are ready to provide our knowledge and experience of many years of work in this area for the implementation of such a large-scale project as the construction of the Trans-Caspian gas pipeline in order to strengthen global energy security,"" Kasapoglu stated.

At the end of the meeting, the sides agreed to meet again in the near future to discuss the project in more details and to explore existing and future mechanisms for the further implementation of new investment projects in Turkmenistan.

Turkmenistan is one of the largest gas resource holders in the Caspian region and has the world's fourth largest proven natural gas reserves."
European Consortium Offers to Build Methanol Plant in Turkmenistan | Business - Business Turkmenistan,"Sun, 18 Aug 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tLnRtL3Bvc3QvNDI3Ni9ldXJvcGVhbi1jb25zb3J0aXVtLW9mZmVycy10by1idWlsZC1tZXRoYW5vbC1wbGFudC1pbi10dXJrbWVuaXN0YW7SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The European consortium composed of Edison Technologies, MMEC Mannesmann GmbH, Air Liquide Global E&C Solutions and the Chinese SINOPEC Engineering Group offers an investment project for the construction of gas-to-methanol plant in Turkmenistan.

During the First Caspian Economic Forum hosted in Avaza National Tourist Zone on August 11-12, Edison Kasapoglu, the President of Edison Technologies, made the large-scale project’s video presentation on behalf of the consortium.

Speaking at the session entitled “Energy Potential of the Caspian Sea”, Kasapoglu said that methanol is widely used in industries such as chemicals, plastics, plywood and paints and varnishes, cosmetics and liquid energy, and noted the fast rise in global methanol demand.

According to the representative of the consortium, the top consumers are the Asian and European countries, mainly China and Germany. The growth in demand is largely due to the use of methanol as a transport fuel for the so-called liquid energy.

With more than 20 million tons produced annually, methanol is a promising energy carrier because, as a liquid, it is easier to store than hydrogen and natural gas. About 40 percent of the methanol is mainly used as a feedstock for the production of chemicals and in such diverse products as plastics, plywood, paints, and propylene production.

The segment is supported by the growing investment in methanol-olefins-MTO in China, the capacity of which is expected to double by 2025. The increasing use of methanol in the chemical industry suggests that it will soon become the main raw material in the sector.

Turkmenistan is one of the largest gas resource holders in the Caspian region and has the world's fourth largest proven natural gas reserves.

Edison Technologies is an engineering and consulting company with wide range of services in light and heavy industries, oil and gas, and electronics, representing the management of detailed planning, feasibility studies and financing opportunities.
