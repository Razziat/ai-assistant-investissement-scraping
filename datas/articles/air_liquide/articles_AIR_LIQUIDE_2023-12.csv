Air Liquide will capture CO₂ from its hydrogen plant and transport it via the Porthos network for permanent storage in depleted gas fields 200km offshore in the North Sea.

This process is expected to contribute to the decarbonisation of hydrogen supplied to Air Liquide’s customers under existing contracts.

Air Liquide noted that Porthos project is set to reduce annual emissions by 2.5 million tonnes of CO₂, approximately 10% of the current industrial emissions in Rotterdam.

The EU has acknowledged the significance of Porthos by listing it as a Project of Common Interest for its potential contribution to the bloc’s energy and climate policy goals.

Air Liquide executive committee member and CEO of the Europe industries hub Emilie Mouren-Renouard said: “We are pleased to take another concrete step to contribute to the decarbonisation of one of Europe’s largest industrial basins while participating to the development of Porthos.

The decision comes just six weeks after Air Products, a rival US-based industrial gases company, announced its own FID on a grey-to-blue conversion of an existing H 2 facility in Rotterdam, which it claims will be the largest in Europe on start-up in 2026.

Air Liquide plans to begin operations of its proprietary Cryocap carbon capture technology — which it had previously installed for its blue hydrogen project at Port Jerome in France — by 2026.

The existing Rotterdam hydrogen plant’s production capacity is around 130,000 cubic metres (11,685kg) per hour — just over 100,000 tonnes annually, presuming round-the-clock operation (a little under the 109,500 tonnes a year expected at Air Products’ facility).

Both projects will transport and store CO 2 via the Netherlands’ flagship Porthos CCS project, which reached its own FID earlier this year.

Porthos, developed by a joint venture between state-owned firms EBN, Gasunie, and the Port of Rotterdam Authority, will transport 2.5 million tonnes of CO 2 a year over the next 15 years to depleted gas fields offshore for storage 3-4km under the seabed.

All 37 million tonnes of storage capacity have already been contracted to four industrial emitters in Rotterdam that had signed joint development agreements: Air Products, Air Liquide, and oil majors Shell and ExxonMobil, although the latter two plan to use the network to capture emissions from other industrial activities.

These four companies were in 2021 awarded €2.1bn ($2.3bn) in grants via the Dutch government’s SDE++ scheme to help pay for the scheme."

Air Liquide SA has unveiled plans to construct, own, and operate a world-scale carbon capture unit in Rotterdam, Netherlands, a strategic move aimed at reducing emissions not only within its operations but also for its customers. The company will leverage its proprietary Cryocap technology for this initiative, installing the unit at its hydrogen production plant situated in Rotterdam's industrial basin, with a connection to Porthos, a prominent carbon capture and storage (CCS) infrastructure in Europe.

The Cryocap technology is a cutting-edge solution for carbon capture, employing a cryogenic process in the extraction of carbon dioxide. The carbon capture process will begin at Air Liquide's hydrogen plant in the Rotterdam port. The captured carbon dioxide will then traverse the Porthos infrastructure, finding its permanent repository in depleted gas fields located approximately 12.4 miles (20 kilometers) off the North Sea coast. Anticipated to become operational in 2026, the carbon capture unit is part of Air Liquide's commitment to supplying significantly decarbonized hydrogen to its long-term customers.

The collaborative venture with Porthos, or the Port of Rotterdam CO2 Transport Hub and Offshore Storage, involves the joint efforts of Energie Beheer Nederland (EBN), Nederlandse Gasunie NV, and the Port of Rotterdam Authority. Porthos, recognized by the European Union as an essential project in meeting climate targets, received the designation of Project of Common Interest, accompanied by a subsidy of $107.8 million (EUR 102 million). The ambitious carbon capture and storage (CCS) project, estimated at $1.37 billion (EUR 1.3 billion), will commence construction in Rotterdam in 2024, targeting operational status by 2026.

Porthos is committed to offering services for the transportation and storage of carbon, enabling the transfer of carbon dioxide from the Rotterdam port to the exhausted gas fields in the North Sea. These fields, situated around 12.4 miles (20 kilometers) off the coast, will serve as the permanent storage location, with depths ranging from 1.9 to 2.5 miles (three to four kilometers) under the seabed. The system plans to store approximately 2.5 million metric tons per year for a duration of 15 years, accumulating around 37 million metric tons at full storage capacity. Additionally, the onshore transport system, currently under construction, is designed to accommodate future carbon storage projects.

Recognizing the significance of Porthos in meeting climate goals, the European Union's declaration of it as a Project of Common Interest underscores its pivotal role in advancing carbon capture and storage solutions. Several companies, including Air Liquide, Air Products, ExxonMobil, and Shell, have expressed interest in the project and intend to invest in their carbon capture installations, further signaling the industry's commitment to sustainable practices and emissions reduction."

Air Liquide to Build Carbon Capture Unit in Rotterdam - Rigzone News,"Mon, 25 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJpZ3pvbmUuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyX2xpcXVpZGVfdG9fYnVpbGRfY2FyYm9uX2NhcHR1cmVfdW5pdF9pbl9yb3R0ZXJkYW0tMjUtZGVjLTIwMjMtMTc1MTU5LWFydGljbGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide SA plans to build, own and operate a world-scale carbon capture unit in the industrial basin of Rotterdam in the Netherlands, as it aims to help reduce emissions for customers as well as at its own operations.

The unit, which will use its proprietary Cryocap technology, will be installed at Air Liquide’s hydrogen production plant located in the port of Rotterdam and will be connected to Porthos, one of Europe’s largest carbon capture and storage infrastructure, the Paris-based company said in a recent news release. Cryocap is a technological solution for carbon capture using a cryogenic process.

Air Liquide will capture the carbon dioxide from its hydrogen plant in the port of Rotterdam. The captured carbon dioxide will then be transported through the Porthos infrastructure and permanently stored in depleted gas fields in the North Sea, approximately 12.4 miles (20 kilometers) off the coast.

Air Liquide expects the carbon capture unit to be operational in 2026. Through the project, the company aims to supply hydrogen that will be significantly decarbonized to its long-term customers, according to the release.

“We are pleased to take another concrete step to contribute to the decarbonization of one of Europe’s largest industrial basins while participating [in] the development of Porthos”, Emilie Mouren-Renouard, member of Air Liquide’s Executive Committee and CEO of the Europe Industries Hub, said. “This new world-scale CO2 capture unit illustrates our expertise and commitment to implementing decarbonization solutions, both for our customers and our own assets, in line with the Group’s ADVANCE strategic plan to reduce its CO2 emissions by 33 percent by 2035.”

Porthos, or Port of Rotterdam CO2 transport hub and offshore storage, is a joint venture of Energie Beheer Nederland (EBN), Nederlandse Gasunie NV, and the Port of Rotterdam Authority. In October, it made a final investment decision to develop the first major carbon dioxide transport and storage system in the Netherlands. The carbon capture and storage (CCS) project is estimated to cost $1.37 billion (EUR 1.3 billion). Project construction will begin in 2024 in Rotterdam, and the Porthos system is targeted to be operational by 2026.

Porthos will provide carbon transport and storage services, transporting carbon dioxide through the port of Rotterdam to depleted gas fields in the North Sea, around 12.4 miles (20 kilometers) off the coast, where it will be permanently stored at a depth of 1.9 to 2.5 miles (three to four kilometers) under the seabed. The company plans to store about 2.5 million metric tons per year for 15 years, totaling around 37 million metric tons at full storage capacity. The onshore transport system under construction allows for future carbon storage projects, the company said in an earlier news release.

Porthos was recognized by the European Union as an “important project in meeting climate targets”, declaring it a Project of Common Interest and awarding a $107.8 million (EUR 102 million) subsidy, the company said. Several companies, including Air Liquide, Air Products, ExxonMobil, and Shell, have indicated interest in the project and will invest in their own carbon capture installations.

Partnership with ENEOS in Japan

Meanwhile, Air Liquide and Japan’s ENEOS Corporation have signed a memorandum of understanding to collaborate on accelerating the development of low-carbon hydrogen in Japan.

The partnership intends to capitalize on ENEOS' strong energy infrastructure and market presence in Japan as well as on Air Liquide's expertise across the entire hydrogen value chain from production, liquefaction, transport, storage and distribution to usage, Air Liquide said in an earlier news release.

On the Upstream front, the partners will study the development of low-carbon hydrogen production, using both carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) and electrolysis technologies. They also plan to examine a possible collaboration in the development of an international liquid hydrogen supply chain to serve the Japanese market from abroad.

On the Downstream front, the partnership will evaluate joint initiatives to develop hydrogen mobility in Japan, including through a hydrogen refueling station infrastructure.

“This collaboration, which will span the whole value chain of renewable and low-carbon hydrogen, will combine the strengths of two leaders in their field”, Armelle Levieux, member of Air Liquide’s Executive Committee and Vice President of Innovation supervising Hydrogen activities, said. “As such, it can significantly contribute to the development of hydrogen as a key element of [the] decarbonization of industry and mobility in Japan. This partnership is yet another sign that Air Liquide is accelerating in the energy transition. It is in line with our strategic plan ADVANCE, which closely links financial and extra-financial performances”.

“We believe the collaboration with Air Liquide, which is one of the world's largest industrial gas companies, will also serve as a basis for leading energy transition and continue to support energy supply in Japan in a carbon neutral society”, Tomohide Miyata, ENEOS Representative Director and Executive Vice President said.

Air Liquide wins contract for Teesside waste-to-jet-fuel plant - The Chemical Engineer,"Mon, 04 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNoZW1pY2FsZW5naW5lZXIuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyLWxpcXVpZGUtd2lucy1jb250cmFjdC1mb3ItdGVlc3NpZGUtd2FzdGUtdG8tamV0LWZ1ZWwtcGxhbnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"AIR LIQUIDE has been awarded a contract to help build a £1.5bn (US$1.9bn) plant in Teesside, UK that will convert household waste into jet fuel.

The plant is being built by Saudi Arabian industrial conglomerate Alfanar and is scheduled to begin operations in 2028, producing around 125,000 t/y of aviation fuel. Air Liquide Engineering & Construction will provide the licence, basic engineering and front-end engineering and design for the new plant’s syngas cleaning, hydrogen purification and carbon capture technologies.

In May, Alfanar signed a partnership with N+P Group to source 1m t/y of non-recyclable waste destined for landfill and build three plants that will instead convert it into pellets that will become the feedstock for the Teesside facility, known as the Lighthouse Green Fuels project.

The plant will use gasification and Fischer-Tropsch technologies to convert the waste pellets into syngas and convert it into liquid fuel that can be blended with conventional jet fuel.

In November, the company was awarded £8.6m from the UK government’s Advanced Fuels Fund. It was among nine projects sharing £53m that the government is providing to help kickstart sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production. It wants at least five commercial-scale SAF plants under construction by 2025 and has set a mandate requiring at least 10% of jet fuel to come from sustainable feedstocks by 2030.

There are doubts about the viability of meeting the target or its environmental credentials. While some feedstocks could help reduce emissions by as much as 80% compared to conventional fuels, there are concerns that the demand for biomass will force up the costs of limited supplies and lead to land use change.

The head of British Airways’ parent group IAG warned in October that there is a 90% risk that the industry will fail to meet the EU’s mandate for SAF to make up 2% of jet fuel in 2025.

Virgin Atlantic made headlines in November after completing the first long-haul flight powered entirely by SAF. It flew from London to New York using a blend of fuel made from waste fats and plant sugars."

3 Chemicals Stocks Set to Continue Their Winning Streaks in 2024 - Yahoo Finance,"Wed, 20 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy8zLWNoZW1pY2Fscy1zdG9ja3Mtc2V0LWNvbnRpbnVlLTEzNTcwMDI5MC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The chemical industry grappled with a slowdown in demand in certain markets, including consumer durables and building & construction, and an unprecedented customer inventory destocking this year. Lower consumer spending due to inflationary pressures in Europe and a slow recovery in China impacted demand.



While the industry remains buffeted by demand headwinds, strategic measures, including operating cost reductions and aggressive price hikes along with declining raw material costs, bode well. Stocks like Axalta Coating Systems Ltd. AXTA, Hawkins, Inc. HWKN and L'Air Liquide S.A. AIQUY are good choices for investment in the current scenario.



Companies in the chemical space have faced headwinds from a slowdown in certain key markets in 2023. The sluggishness in the building & construction market and destocking in consumer electronics have played spoilsport. In North America, uncertainties surrounding the U.S. housing market are weighing on building & construction. The housing market is bearing the brunt of interest rate hikes. Softer demand in industrial and consumer durables is hurting chemical volumes. Weaker global economic activities led to a higher level of uncertainty, affecting the chemical space.



A slower recovery in economic activities in China following the lifting of the restrictions related to the resurgence in COVID-19 infections has hurt chemical demand in that country this year. Global industrial activities have been affected by the weaker demand recovery in China. The slowdown in Europe, resulting from the war in Ukraine and weaker consumer spending due to high levels of inflation and rising interest rates, have also led to softer demand in that region. The energy and feedstock inflation resulted in reduced industrial production and consumer spending in Europe.



Nevertheless, demand for chemicals in the automotive market has remained healthy, aided by a recovery in automotive production on an improved supply of semiconductors. Notably, the U.S. automotive sector got back into gear after reeling under the effects of the chip crisis for nearly two years. The recent resolution to the six-week United Auto Workers (UAW) strike also augurs well for chemical demand in this space.



Demand in packaging and healthcare also remains strong. Moreover, chemical companies are seeing a recovery in demand across the aerospace and energy markets. A rebound in drilling activities on the back of an uptick in oil prices has led to the demand recovery in the energy space. On a more positive note, customer inventory destocking — that hurt the chemical industry for much of this year — has largely ended, which should lead to an uptick in chemical demand in 2024. A moderation in raw material and energy costs driven by the easing of supply-chain disruptions is also expected to act as a tailwind.



Meanwhile, chemical companies continue to take a host of strategic measures, including cost-cutting and productivity improvement, operational efficiency improvement and actions to strengthen the balance sheet and boost cash flows amid a challenging environment. In particular, the industry participants are aggressively implementing actions to bring down costs. They are also raising selling prices to counter inflation. Such moves are likely to help the industry sustain margins amid the prevailing challenges. A decline in raw material and energy costs driven by the easing of supply-chain disruptions also augurs well for the chemical industry heading into 2024.

(The KCCI)

Business lobby group Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry held a meeting with delegation of the Movement of the Enterprises of France (MEDEF), the largest employer federation in France, to discuss ways to develop cooperation in the fields of human resources and business between the two countries.

Hanwha TotalEnergies Petrochemical CEO Laurentius Na, who was recently named by the KCCI to lead business cooperation with France held talks with his counterpart Air-Liquide CEO Francois Jackow who doubles as chair of the France-South Korea Business Council of the MEDEF and Vice Chairman Christophe Fontaine, in the meeting held at the KCCI headquarters in central Seoul on Tuesday.

Other attendees from the French side include some eight executives from Fives Group, Total Energies, Thales and Airbus.

The meeting of Na and Jackow in Korea is an extension of KCCI Executive Vice Chairman Woo Tae-hee and Korean business leaders’ trip to France this summer. During the visit, the KCCI and MEDEF International jointly held their first business roundtable in Paris.

Attended by 30 top conglomerates and government officials from the two nations, the business roundtable discussed strategic partnerships in the energy and technology sectors. The top executives from Samsung Electronics, SK Group, LG Electronics, Kia as well as Accor Group, Air Liquide and JCDecaux joined the event.

The KCCI and MEDEF International also signed a memorandum of understanding to expand collaborative efforts in the industrial and economic fields by regularly hosting the Korea-France business roundtables, whenever the business delegation and government officials visit each other’s country.

Serving as a bridge between the two nations, the next business roundtables will zero in on the renewable energy, nuclear energy and net-zero emissions sectors, the KCCI said.

“The Korea-France trading volume has already surpassed $12.9 billion (16.76 trillion won) as of last year, indicating the two countries’ active collaboration in the economic field,” said the KCCI’s Vice President Lee Seung-woo. “The KCCI will continue to serve as a communication channel connecting industry partners.”"
Should I Invest in Hydrogen? - Morningstar.ca,"Mon, 04 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcm5pbmdzdGFyLmNhL2NhL25ld3MvMjQzMzc5L3Nob3VsZC1pLWludmVzdC1pbi1oeWRyb2dlbi5hc3B40gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hydrogen is poised to grow at an exponential rate in the coming years as an energy source, but is now the right time to buy in?

Based on the Hydrogen Council projections, hydrogen will account for 18% of the global energy demand by 2050, which means a nearly eightfold increase in the size of the global hydrogen market. The International Energy Agency estimates hydrogen will cover 10% of the global energy demand by 2050, which would be a threefold increase from current levels.

Why is there a growing interest in hydrogen? Environmental considerations are one of the main reasons. The goal of the Paris Agreement is to significantly reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to help limit global warming to less than 2°C compared with pre-industrial levels. Hydrogen has the potential to help reduce global CO2 emissions, in particular those from transportation industry.

Morningstar analysts expect strong growth in clean hydrogen investments to continue but they are less optimistic than the consensus. They think there are some constraints that need to be removed to facilitate the transition to a hydrogen economy, such the high costs of producing and distributing clean hydrogen.

A significant build-out of hydrogen infrastructure and policy support for clean hydrogen to become cost competitive will also be needed. Even if they believe that hydrogen offers a pathway to help decarbonise the economy, they highlight the difference between hydrogen types. Decarbonisation will require a shift away from grey toward blue and green hydrogen.

Make it Cheaper

""Clean hydrogen has become a key element of many governments' decarbonisation strategies,"" says Krzysztof Smalec, equity analyst for Morningstar.

The European Union estimates that cumulative investments in hydrogen could reach €180 billion-€470 billion (CAD$266 billion-$695 billion) by 2050 and China expects hydrogen to count for 10% of its energy share by 2050. And while the United States has not committed to an official federal strategy yet, Smalec think their future infrastructure spending packages could include investments in hydrogen.

The first challenge is to make hydrogen competitive is to decrease the cost of production, he adds. Green hydrogen, produced using renewable energy sources such as solar or wind, is at least two-to-three times as expensive as grey hydrogen, which is made from fossil fuels. Blue hydrogen, instead, has a narrow gap in terms of production costs and offers a 60% to 95% reduction in emissions, depending on the carbon capture technology.

Based on these considerations, the best way to take advantage from this long-term trend, say Morningstar analysts, is to select on industrial gas firms as they are established players in the production and distribution of conventional hydrogen.

The gas industry stocks under our coverage performed differently in 2023. The French company Air Liquide is up 28% (in € at November 27) and now is trading at a Price/Fair value (P/FV) of 1.15. Linde's shares recorded a 29% gain (in USD) and now the price is almost in line with our valuation, while Air Products and Chemicals is discounted by more than 10% compared with its fair value of $314, as their shares are down 115% (in USD) in the year to date.

Here are the views of Krzysztof Smalec, Morningstar equity analyst on three sector stocks:

Air Products and Chemicals (APD)

With more than 20% of their sales that come from hydrogen, Air Products and Chemicals is the largest supplier of hydrogen in the world and the company with highest exposure to hydrogen among the three names under our coverage. We expect Air Products' hydrogen exposure to increase significantly, as the company has announced several multi-billion-dollar blue and green hydrogen mega projects, expected to come onstream over the next years, and that by 2035 hydrogen could account for as much as 70%-80% of their revenue.

Based on our expectations, new investments will fuel strong growth, helping the company more than double its adjusted EPS over the next five years. By the way, we think that the market’s focus will increasingly turn from new project announcements to execution, and uncertainty around the backlog could weigh on the stock.

Air Liquide (AI)

Air Liquide generated approximately €30 (CAD$44) billion of revenue in 2022, serving a wide range of industries, including chemicals, energy, healthcare, food and beverage, and electronics.

Air Liquide is the second-largest industrial gas distributor in the world and benefits from operating in an industry that is inherently moaty because of high switching costs. Although industrial gases are essentially commodities, they are a crucial input in many industries. Since gas typically represents only a fraction of total costs, customers are often willing to pay a premium and enter into long-term contracts with reputable distributors to ensure uninterrupted supply.

As such, public industrial gas companies have historically earned returns in excess of their cost of capital, and we believe these lucrative profits will persist. Over 40% of Air Liquide’s investment opportunities are related to the energy transition, including low-carbon hydrogen as well as carbon capture and storage. We expect opportunities in hydrogen to be a meaningful revenue driver, as Air Liquide recently unveiled plans to invest roughly € 8 billion in low-carbon hydrogen over the next 15 years. Management expects these investments to triple the firm’s hydrogen revenue by 2035, from roughly €2 billion in 2020 to €6 billion.

Linde (LIN)

Linde is the largest industrial gas supplier in the world, with operations in over 100 countries. The firm's main products are atmospheric gases (including oxygen, nitrogen, and argon) and process gases (including hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and helium), as well as equipment used in industrial gas production.

Demand for industrial gases is strongly correlated to industrial production. But even if organic revenue growth largely depends on global economic conditions, in the third quarter Linde reported a 3% year-over-year revenue growth and 400 bp increase in its operating margin. The company raised its full-year guidance on adjusted EPS to US$14.00-US$14.10 (from $13.80-$14.00), and so we have raised our fair value estimate to US$393 from US$379.

Linde has announced a multi-million dollar investment to develop hydrogen infrastructure in South Korea and has a comprehensive portfolio of blue hydrogen solutions which we think will help the firm win its fair share of opportunities in the space.

India's ambition to emerge as a manufacturing hub for semiconductors is getting another boost. The government is revising a crucial incentives scheme by raising the corpus and adopting a more effective way to reimburse incentives to companies.The new incentive plan -- which is likely to be launched at the start of the next fiscal year -- will have a corpus of Rs 10,000 crore, ET has reported. It will be an updated version of the current Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS). Currently, the SPECS scheme has a corpus of around Rs 3200-3300 crore. It may be structured to disburse funds as and when the companies invest or achieve certain milestones. At present, the SPECS scheme provides a reimbursement of up to 25% of the total capital expenditure on the project after the completion of the work on the unit.With this revised scheme, the government is raising its bet on a small but crucial part of its chip-making ambition: the ancillary industry.India's chip-making ambitions are taking off. In addition to the ATMP (assembly, testing, marking, packaging) plants announced by Micron, Tata Electronics and Kaynes Corp, others like the HCL Group and Tamil Nadu-based Murugappa Group are also finalising their plans to enter the sector.“To support these ATMP plants, (several) ancillary industries and component makers are coming to India and are requesting support from the government,” an official aware of the developments has told ET. The ancillary units include those providing raw materials including specialty chemicals and gases used in the process of fabrication, assembly, marking, testing, and packaging of semiconductor chips With America’s Micron having received necessary approvals from the centre to set up an ATMP unit at Sanand in Gujarat, there has been an influx of companies-- supplying specialised chemicals, gases, integrated circuit packaging substrate, purified air and other equipment—also looking to set up allied units in the area to support the semiconductor major.The revised scheme aims to help companies interested in setting up these ancillary units.China's success in becoming a chip-making giant is rooted in its developed ecosystem that supports its chip-making units. Since chip-making involves a complex value chain with no company owning all the functions in the value chain, self-reliance in chip-making is not confined to just chip-manufacturing plants but also the ancillary and components industry which is smaller in scale that chip-making plants but provides a firm ground for chip-making.In the absence of an ecosystem of ancillary and component industry, it's not possible to indigenise the manufacturing of chips because chip-makers will remain dependent on imports for components, etc.Initially, India is focusing on Assembly, Testing, Marking and Packaging (ATMP) and Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (OSAT) as well as chip designing where it has an edge due to availability of design engineers. A developed ecosystem, which would include wafers, specialty chemicals, gases and materials, can prepare the ground for big chip-making plants.For example, a stable and secure materials supply chain is imperative for the smooth functioning of the semiconductor industry. China has strategically invested in securing a reliable supply of materials, including silicon wafers, chemicals, and gases. Air Liquide, a global supplier of industrial gases, has a significant presence in China's semiconductor ecosystem. By providing high-purity gases essential for semiconductor manufacturing, Air Liquide has contributed to the precision and reliability of semiconductor production processes, ensuring a stable materials supply chain. Similarly, GlobalWafers, a leading Taiwanese silicon wafer manufacturer, has played a crucial role in addressing the demand for silicon substrates in China's semiconductor industry. The company's manufacturing facilities in China have not only supplied silicon wafers for chip production but have also stimulated the growth of ancillary industries supporting wafer production and processing.Companies like Air Liquide and GlobalWafers have been integral in sustaining the materials supply chain in China.While manufacturing of equipment, such as photolithography machines, is at the top rung of the chips ancillary industry and involves highly advanced technology, India can begin to build the ecosystem by focusing on materials, gases and chemicals.The semiconductor industry is highly reliant on a complex supply chain. Establishing a robust ecosystem helps mitigate risks associated with disruptions in the supply chain. A diversified and resilient supply chain ensures that the production of semiconductor devices can continue even in the face of unforeseen challenges. That's why the government spending Rs 10,000 crore on incentivising the ancillary and components industry is critical when India is taking its first steps towards chip-making."
"ORLEN, Lafarge and Air Liquide receive grant for CO2 terminal in Gdańsk - CEO Magazyn Polska","Wed, 13 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vY2VvLmNvbS5wbC9lbi9vcmxlbi1sYWZhcmdlLWFuZC1haXItbGlxdWlkZS1yZWNlaXZlLWdyYW50LWZvci1jbzItdGVybWluYWwtaW4tZ2RhbnNrLTU3NDY0L9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vY2VvLmNvbS5wbC9lbi9vcmxlbi1sYWZhcmdlLWFuZC1haXItbGlxdWlkZS1yZWNlaXZlLWdyYW50LWZvci1jbzItdGVybWluYWwtaW4tZ2RhbnNrLTU3NDY0Lz9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The marine carbon dioxide transshipment terminal, a joint venture by ORLEN, Lafarge Cement S.A., and Air Liquide Polska, has secured a grant from the European Commission to prepare investment project documentation and feasibility studies for the supply chain. The terminal’s construction will contribute to ORLEN’s strategic objectives of reducing its own CO2 emissions. It will also facilitate services related to carbon dioxide management for businesses, for which carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is the only available technology to reduce emissions. Between 2027-2030, ORLEN will have the capacity to manage or sequester 3 million tonnes of CO2 annually.

The planned CO2 terminal is part of the “PL-EU Interconnector” initiative, which is included in the list of Projects of Common Interest (PCI), housing projects crucial for implementing the EU’s energy and climate policy. The project’s objective is to complete the necessary engineering and transport studies for the construction of a multimodal carbon dioxide terminal in Gdansk. The grant, amounting to €2.54 million, was awarded under the “Connecting Europe” programme (CEF Energy PCI “Studies”) and will be used to prepare project documentation, including the Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) for the marine terminal.

The terminal’s construction will be divided into two phases, with the first phase achieving a throughput capacity of 3 million tonnes of CO2 annually. Approximately 1 million tonnes of CO2 will be used by ORLEN for carbon dioxide sequestration from the Płock Production Plant, about 1 million tonnes will be used by Lafarge Cement S.A., and the remaining 1 million tonnes will be available for commercial services. This solution will benefit sectors where avoiding CO2 emissions is challenging due to technological reasons, resulting in limited options to significantly reduce CO2 emissions, particularly the steel and cement industries.

The planned location for the terminal is Gdansk. It is anticipated that carbon dioxide will be delivered to the terminal from industrial plants in the central and northern parts of the country, then shipped and transported to final sequestration points located under the seabed. Initially, carbon dioxide will be transported by rail to the terminal, although the ultimate solution is to build a pipeline transporting CO2.

Lafarge Cement S.A., a partner of ORLEN, signed an agreement in January 2023 to co-finance the Kujawy Go4ECOPlanet project under the Innovation Fund competition. The project foresees the launch of a CO2 capture installation in the Kujawy Cement Plant in 2027, which will enable the complete reduction of the carbon footprint from clinker firing.

The construction of the marine CO2 terminal is the first investment of its kind in Poland and one of the first in the region. The project will allow the ORLEN Group to establish itself as a leader in carbon dioxide emission management services and will facilitate the group’s achievement of carbon neutrality by 2050. The investment will contribute to the development of infrastructure for CO2 transport in Central and Eastern Europe.

Additionally, in September this year, ORLEN, in partnership with Lafarge Cement S.A. and Air Liquide Polska, and in cooperation with ORLEN Lietuva, obtained PCI project status for the ECO2CEE project (a continuation of the “EU CCS Interconnector” project), on the new list of PCI/PMI projects. This will enable applications for co-financing of the terminal construction works from the CEF Energy PCI “Works” programme for the years 2024-2025."
