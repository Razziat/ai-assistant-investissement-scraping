China’s Hydrogen Society Beginning to Take Shape - Cleantech Group,"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsZWFudGVjaC5jb20vY2hpbmFzLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLXNvY2lldHktYmVnaW5uaW5nLXRvLXRha2Utc2hhcGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"China’s Hydrogen Society Beginning to Take Shape

Last year, we detailed how China’s government had promoted ambitious plans for the development of a hydrogen economy and specifically, how the country’s Science and Technology Minister had expressed a goal of creating a hydrogen society in China.

This year, we are witnessing some of these ambitions bear fruit, as various cities and state-owned companies have launched initiatives which are spurning private sector and multinational investment, as compared to a noticeable absence of private sector involvement in the space this time last year.

Converting the Corporates – Private Companies and Multinationals Buying In

Despite the challenges related to efficiency and innovation that Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are vulnerable to, one advantage SOEs enjoy in the critical infrastructure sector is the ability to undertake large, experimental, and often risky investments without the same pressure of continuous profitability which private sector actors face.

The wave of investment in hydrogen by China’s SOEs has decreased project risk profiles for hydrogen projects, laying the foundation for the country’s hydrogen economy, with notable investments coming from both China’s private enterprise and multinational corporations.

Ningxia Baofeng Energy Group, a private coal production and processing company, announced in April of this year a start to construction on the world’s largest solar-powered hydrogen plant in Ningxia Hui, northwest China. The plant, which will begin producing hydrogen by 2021, will consist of two 10,000m3/hr electrolyzers powered by two 100 MW solar plants plus a 1,000kg/day hydrogenation station, producing 160 million cubic meters of hydrogen annually.

In late 2019, Air Liquide partnered with Sinopec to open two hydrogen refueling stations in Shanghai, with the ability to serve 200 hydrogen fuel cell buses operating in the area. This came just a few months after Air Liquide formed a special purpose joint venture with Chinese company Huopu in mid-2019 to open the first hydrogen refueling station in Zhejiang province. The Air Liquide-Huopu joint venture has also committed to delivering a hydrogen refueling station in Beijing as a part of the infrastructure for the 2022 Olympic Games.

Racing Toward 2022 – Hydrogen as a Keystone of the Beijing Winter Olympics

Laying the groundwork for a green Beijing Olympic Games in 2022, the city government has set a target of having 1,000 fuel cell buses operating by the time the games commence. Sinopec has agreed to construct 10 hydrogen refueling stations in one of the Games’ competition zones, Zhangjiakou, to support the hydrogen buses serving attendees. Further evidence of the ways in which SOEs are leveraging private sector partnerships to achieve goals is the series of Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) that government-owned China Power has inked with multinational technology companies.

In late August, Siemens arrived at a deal with China Power to provide a hydrogen production system in the Yanquing District of Beijing, one of the three competition areas for the 2022 Olympic Games.

Irish-headquartered industrial processes and specialty gases company Linde signed an MoU with a subsidiary of China Power in July to implement hydrogen mobility solutions for the 2022 Olympics in Beijing.

New Energy Vehicles Still a Hotbed of Entrepreneurship

The government continues to promote ambitious targets for increased roll-out of Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs), aiming to have over 1 million on the road by 2030, accompanied by 1,000 hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs).

The dynamism of China’s electric vehicle market is due in large part to the participation of start-ups utilizing unique business models to compete against incumbents, such as Nio’s battery-swapping stations and Li Auto’s vertically-integrated manufacturing process (versus Nio, who outsources production). Achieving the government’s targets for FCEVs on the road will partially be a function of how well the country’s entrepreneurs fair in innovating their way into the space.

New Entrants: A Case in an Emerging District’s Journey to Become a National Center of Hydrogen Innovation

Situated along the ZhuJiang (Pearl) River in China’s fourth-largest city of GuangZhou is HuangPu District, an emerging industrial district with a population of 880,000, that has quickly built a reputation for fast implementation of hydrogen technologies. The district has used a policy mix of company registration incentives, capital expenditure alleviation, and a 5 billion Yuan venture fund to attract new companies and projects to the district. Perhaps more importantly, the district leveraged advantages in local hydrogen resources (industrial hydrogen by-products, wastewater for electrolysis, chemical production facilities) and infrastructure laid by a local automotive manufacturing and assembly industry to create a hydrogen industrial base predicted to be valued at 20 billion Yuan by 2025 and 100 billion Yuan by 2030.

Over 20 hydrogen start-ups have been launched in the district as a result of the district’s policies and the opportunities to engage public procurement of hydrogen technology. The district plans to construct an international hydrogen industrial park to serve the wider hydrogen industry in Guangzhou, to accelerate innovation in fuel cells, hydrogen refueling, and energy storage with hydrogen, supported by participation from Sinopec, CIMC, and China Southern Power Grid.

Keep an Eye on…

Coal gasification remains the greatest potential source of hydrogen production in China; however, production of truly green hydrogen requires a comprehensive system of carbon capture, use, and storage that many facilities are not prepared to bear CAPEX burdens for. China’s mass deployment of solar and wind projects in the past two decades offers a unique path forward – many renewable assets were deployed without a reliable connection to a grid and many of the wind and solar technologies deployed are inefficient. This leaves an opportunity open to convert potentially stranded renewable assets into local producers of hydrogen for energy storage. Additionally, China is likely to see a boost to targets for wind and solar energy, with National People’s Congress recommending a minimum of 150GW wind capacity and 300GW solar capacity for inclusion in the upcoming 14th Five Year Plan.

The 14th Five Year Plan (2021-2025), set to be released in October, is likely to lay out more concrete measures for hydrogen and FCEVs to move China further toward energy independence. The current Five Year Plan mentions the importance of hydrogen at a macroeconomic level and public funding for new energy vehicles under the “Financial Support Policy for New Energy Vehicles 2016-2020” incentivized investment in FCEVs through the end of 2020. Subsidies under this program will now be extended through 2022 (excluding vehicles with swappable batteries and those costing over $42,863) and will be reduced by 20% in 2021 and 30% in 2022.

However, the global recession and sustained fallout over trade with the United States are likely to place increased pressure on hydrogen to play a meaningful role in the country’s next phase of development and motivate further public investment and incentives for actors in the sector."
SwRI receives $6.4 million in funding to design sCO2 oxy-fuel turbine - EurekAlert,"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmVrYWxlcnQub3JnL25ld3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvOTA3ODQy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SAN ANTONIO -- Oct. 19, 2020 -- Southwest Research Institute has received $6.4 mil-lion in funding from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and other organizations to design a supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO 2 ), oxy-fuel turbine for use in a direct-fired sCO 2 power plant. The turbine, which can use either coal syngas or natural gas as a fuel source, minimizes harmful emissions released to the environment.

The Coal FIRST (Flexible, Innovative, Resilient, Small, Transformative) program aims to develop modular, state of the art efficiency, and near zero emissions power plants utilizing coal syngas fired sCO 2 power cycles to meet the ramp rates and loads required for future energy needs with higher reliance on renewable energy sources. $5.1 million of the project's funding will come from DOE, and SwRI will be collaborating with General Electric Global Research Center, Air Liquide, 8 Rivers Capital, LLC, Electric Power Research Institute, Inc., Purdue University and University of Central Florida.

""This project leverages the sCO 2 power cycle and incorporates a direct-fired combustor like a traditional gas turbine but does it at much higher pressures and in a pure CO 2 environment,"" said SwRI Institute Engineer Dr. Jeff Moore, the project's leader. ""A power plant built with this technology can burn both coal and natural gas at state-of-the-art efficiency with truly zero emissions. The technology offers near 100% carbon capture, while producing no oxides of nitrogen or sulfur emissions typical of tradition-al coal-fired power plants.""

Coal syngas is created by partially combusting coal, which creates a gaseous stream of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. The process separates sulfur, mercury and other pollutants instead of releasing them into the atmosphere. That stream fuels the turbine and, when burned with pure oxygen, produces only water and near-pure CO 2 , which can be captured and sequestered for other uses.

""Our goal is to design the turbine for the coal plant of the future,"" said Stefan Cich, a group leader in SwRI's Rotating Machine Dynamics section and co-leader of the project team. ""As more renewable energy is added to the energy mix, we need to develop smaller, efficient power plants that can come online quickly and meet energy demands when renewable sources are not available while still reducing overall emissions.""

The turbine is designed for use in an sCO 2 power plant such as the 10 MWe facility under construction at SwRI's San Antonio headquarters. These power cycles use super-critical CO 2 as the thermal medium instead of water. Because sCO 2 has properties of both a liquid and a gas, it can produce significantly more power from equipment a frac-tion of the size required by traditional power cycles.

""Oxy-fuel sCO 2 cycles take these advantages even further, allowing for higher firing temperatures, improved efficiency and simpler carbon capture strategies,"" Moore said.

SwRI has received numerous DOE and industry-funded projects to implement pilot-scale sCO 2 power cycle components and system level equipment in addition to the 10 MWe Super Transformational Electric Power Pilot Plant under construction at SwRI. Work on the turbine is set to begin in the fall of 2020.

Producers and consumers of fossil fuels face growing expenses for releasing greenhouse gases.

Equinor and Microsoft are considering ways that the United States–based software and hardware giant’s technology can contribute to the Norwegian national project to capture and store carbon dioxide or CO2. The state-owned energy company, which was earlier called Statoil and was mostly responsible for oil production, is developing the Northern Lights initiative, where Royal Dutch Shell and Total have one third each.

The government sent a proposition to parliament in September to approve just under half of the funds for umbrella project Longship (Langskip in Norwegian), worth an overall NOK 25.1 billion (EUR 2.3 billion), and the final investment decision is expected by the end of the year. In the program’s previous version, the state was supposed to provide EUR 2.1 billion within a larger total budget.

Microsoft enters umbrella project in CO2 transport, storage segment

Microft signed a memorandum of understanding concerning a digital platform only for Northern Lights, which covers transportation, receipt and permanent storage of liquefied CO2 under the North Sea. Companies that produce and consume fossil fuels are looking for ways to reduce costs for greenhouse gas emissions allowances while the European Union and many countries are making standards stricter.

“One of the world’s imperatives is the need to develop new ways to capture, transport, and permanently store carbon. This will require enormous investment and innovation, including a huge amount of computing power and data,” said Brad Smith, president of the multinational company headquartered in Redmond, Washington. He noted Microsoft intends to cut its net CO2 emissions to zero by 2030.

Possibility of direct investment

The agreement stipulates the two sides would work on a model for a conventional investment. Namely, Microsoft has earmarked USD 1 billion for technology that prevents CO2 from escaping into the atmosphere and it is leaning on it in its decarbonization push. Within the deal, the companies revealed, they will jointly explore and establish advocacy of policies that help accelerate the contribution that CO2 capture and storage can make to meeting Europe’s climate goals.

Memoranda of understanding were already signed with Air Liquide, Arcelor Mittal, Ervia, Fortum, HeidelbergCement, Preem, Stockholm Exergi and ETH Zürich

The project can help clients mitigate emissions caused by their own energy use, according to Shell. The plan includes the development of a business model for carbon capture and storage, CCS, applicable throughout Europe, the participants said. Memoranda of understanding were already signed with Air Liquide, Arcelor Mittal, Ervia, Fortum, HeidelbergCement, Preem, Stockholm Exergi i ETH Zürich.

The start of operations is scheduled for 2024 and the capacity in the first phase is estimated at 1.5 billion tons of CO2 per year. The geological reservoir is located 2,600 meters below the seabed. The terminal will be built in Øygarden in the Western Norway region.

Groundbreaking endeavor for cement industry, waste incineration

Microsoft said it already cooperates with the three global oil companies for a long time and added no government or corporation can solve the issue alone.

The Norwegian government intends to support capturing of the greenhouse gas in a cement factory in Brevik run by Norcem HeidelbergCement. The propositions includes Fortum’s waste incinerator in Oslo on the condition that the firm also commits own funds and manages to get financing from the EU or elsewhere.

Aker Carbon Capture, recently spun off by Aker Solutions, already signed a contract valued at NOK 1.7 billion or EUR 156 million for carbon capture in in the Brevik plant in the country’s south. It would be the first such project anywhere in the cement industry. Equinor hired Skanska for works on the future terminal, worth NOK 380 million (EUR 35 million)."

The unit will become a joint venture between the Johannesburg-based company and US chemicals giant, Sasol said in a statement Friday. The deal is subject to a vote by shareholders and is expected to be completed this year.

Sasol has been looking to reduce borrowings after a series of cost overruns and delays at its Lake Charles chemicals project in Louisiana were exacerbated by a historic rout in the oil market. The deal will cut debt to about $8 billion from $10 billion, the company said, building on the disposal of other assets such as last month’s sale of an air-separation unit to Air Liquide SA for R8.5 billion.

“This sale was widely anticipated and the $2 billion price is broadly in-line with our assessment,” Morgan Stanley analysts led by Christopher Nicholson said in a note to clients.

Rights Offer

Alongside the asset-sale plan, Sasol is considering a rights offer of as much as $2 billion before the end of June even after saying the move is a last resort. “This, if implemented, would allow Sasol to operate sustainably within its covenant thresholds,” the company said, adding that the timing and amount to be raised would be dictated by the market.

Lake Charles was approved in 2014 at an estimated cost of $8.1 billion but has exceeded the company’s worst-case scenario and is now expected to cost $13 billion. The debacle cost former co-Chief Executive Officers Bongani Nqwababa and Stephen Cornell their jobs after an investigation found serious mismanagement in the development of the plant. They were replaced late last year by Fleetwood Grobler.

The new joint venture will focus on base-chemical production including ethylene and polyethylene, the group said. For LyondellBasell, the deal is expected to add to cash flow and earnings within one year “with significant upside as market conditions continue to improve,” Chief Executive Officer Bob Patel said in a separate statement"

Sasol's joint venture in US chemicals project allows it breathing space | Business - News24,"Sat, 03 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MyNC5jb20vZmluMjQvY29tcGFuaWVzL3Nhc29scy1qb2ludC12ZW50dXJlLWluLXVzLWNoZW1pY2Fscy1wcm9qZWN0LWFsbG93cy1pdC1icmVhdGhpbmctc3BhY2UtMjAyMDEwMDPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Shareholders are expected to vote on the transaction in a meeting on 22 November.

The transaction is expected to reduce net debt before lease liabilities from approximately $10 billion to $8 billion.

CEO Fleetwood Grobler said the joint venture was ""big step forward"" for the company.

The newly announced joint venture between Sasol and LyondellBasell in its Lake Charles Chemicals project gives the company much needed breathing space to stabilise its constrained balance sheet and reduce debt.

The 50:50, $2-billion partnership with the multinational chemicals firm was unveiled on Friday, months after Sasol announced that it was looking for a partner in the project which has been hit by cost overruns and faced a temporary shutdown due to the impact of Hurricane Laura in August.

The transaction is expected to be finalised by the end of year, according to CEO Fleetwood Grobler who expressed confidence that the company does not anticipate any concerns regarding the transaction which is still subject to shareholder and anti-trust approval.

Shareholders are expected to vote on the transaction at a meeting set down for 22 November.

Fleetwood described the transaction ""a big step forward"" for the company in its quest to stabilise its balance sheet which has faced increasing pressure from fluctuating oil prices and the impact of Covid-19 which hit oil demand.

""We are aiming to close the transaction before the end of 2020... we are not anticipating any particular concerns,"" he said, cautioning that some regulatory processes may take longer.

""There is a risk that it may fall in early 2021,"" he added

""We are progressing our Sasol 2.0 initiative to support the reset of the organisation to be sustainable and profitable in the low price environment,"" said Grobler.

The transaction is a critical part of Sasol's response plan to reduce net debt, improve debt covenant compliance and enhance liquidity. As a result of this transaction, net debt before lease liabilities, is expected to reduce materially from approximately $10 billion to approximately $8 billion.



Sasol said the intention of the transaction was to ""generate significant proceeds to apply towards outstanding debt"", while enhancing the benefits from the investment in Lake Charles.

The company has in the past months been offloading its assets, including the last month's sale of an air-separation unit to Air Liquide SA for R8.5 billion.

Proceeds from the Lake Charles transactions and other sales will contribute to net debt reduction by close to $3 billion.

Zaid Paruk, portfolio manager at Aeon Asset Management, said the $2-billion price tag for the 50% share demonstrated the financial knock that was taken by the company in the controversial funding of the project which led to enormous overruns.

""It crystalises the losses that were incurred by the company in the construction phase, that is the key takeway from the transaction,"" he said adding that it also relieves the company's debt pressure in the short term.

Paruk said the focus now moves to the $2-billion rights issue which is being considered by the company. Lake Charles was approved in 2014 at an estimated cost of $8.1 billion, but has exceeded the company's worst-case scenario and is now expected to cost $12.9 billion.



The funding fiasco cost former co-Chief Executive Officers Bongani Nqwababa and Stephen Cornell their jobs although the executives were not found guilty of any wrongdoing.

The joint venture allows Sasol to retain ownership and operatorship of the US Performance Chemicals Business and the remainder of the vacant land on Lake Charles complex. The base chemicals manufactured at the plant include ethylene and polyethylene products.

The said road is located on the National Road 22, which facilitates access to the Kribi deep seaport.

""The engineering structures also include the construction of two bridges. Our teams have just completed the installation of 23-meter long 50-ton prefabricated girders. They will support the bridge that will cross the Akié Mvengue River. Two truck cranes (80T and 65T) were needed for this operation,"" the company indicates. It adds that in the long term, this axis will be mainly used by heavy vehicles transporting goods from the Kribi deep seaport to Yaoundé.

The construction of the Olama-Bingambo is financed by the Islamic Development Bank and the State of Cameroon to the tune of XAF87.7 billion. In April 2020, the construction was 10.5% completed (for 35.2% of the deadline). The works carried out by Sogea-Satom should be completed in July 2021.
