"Air Liquide, Toyota and CaetanoBus join forces to accelerate the development of hydrogen mobility in Europe - Air Liquide","Tue, 17 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5haXJsaXF1aWRlLmNvbS9ncm91cC9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy1uZXdzLzIwMjItMDUtMTcvYWlyLWxpcXVpZGUtdG95b3RhLWFuZC1jYWV0YW5vYnVzLWpvaW4tZm9yY2VzLWFjY2VsZXJhdGUtZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQtaHlkcm9nZW4tbW9iaWxpdHktZXVyb3Bl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide, CaetanoBus and Toyota Motor Europe have signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the aim of developing integrated hydrogen solutions. This will include infrastructure development and vehicle fleets, to accelerate the expansion of hydrogen mobility for both light and heavy-duty vehicles. The partnership reflects the shared ambition of the three partners to contribute to decarbonizing transport and accelerate the development of local hydrogen ecosystems for multiple mobility applications.

The three companies will use their complementary expertise to address the entire value chain of hydrogen mobility, ranging from renewable or low-carbon hydrogen production, distribution and refueling infrastructure to the deployment of different vehicle segments. Initially, the focus will be on buses, light commercial vehicles and cars, with the further aim to accelerate the heavy-duty truck segment.

By exploring joint opportunities, the three major players of hydrogen mobility will contribute to the emergence of new hydrogen ecosystems across Europe, a key step to stimulate the demand and facilitate hydrogen access for other mobility applications. This includes the infrastructure and refueling stations, as well as integrated vehicle offers (leasing and service) to customers such as taxi companies, fleet operators, local authorities, and others. The integration of different applications and projects within a hydrogen ecosystem, where supply and demand meet, will enable the overall hydrogen infrastructure to further mature. This initiative represents another step along the path of decarbonization, which is consistent with the stronger focus from European governments and the readiness of hydrogen technologies.

Matthieu Giard, Vice President, member of the Executive Committee of Air Liquide, notably supervising Hydrogen activities, said:

“As a key solution to reduce CO2 emissions of the mobility sector, low-carbon hydrogen is a crucial enabler of the energy transition. Air Liquide is pleased to partner with Toyota and CaetanoBus. Such partnerships are essential to create efficient ecosystems that will foster the emergence of hydrogen mobility in Europe. Air Liquide has been committed for more than 50 years to develop the entire hydrogen value chain and will bring its expertise in both the production of low-carbon hydrogen and the development of hydrogen mobility infrastructures. This partnership illustrates the capacity of the industry to bring concrete solutions to the fight against climate change.”

Matt Harrison, President and CEO at Toyota Motor Europe comments:

“We are excited by the opportunity to combine our strengths to expand the development of hydrogen clusters. Toyota’s role is to bring the hydrogen applications into the ecosystem, and by working together with our partners we want to accelerate and intensify the use of hydrogen as a carbon neutral solution for mobility. This will gradually reduce the costs of hydrogen and its infrastructure while improving the business case for many future applications including mobility“

Patrícia Vasconcelos, CEO of CaetanoBus, said:"

A French energy giant has opened a new facility in Southern Nevada where it will produce 30 tons of liquid hydrogen per day.

Air Liquide held a ribbon-cutting ceremony Tuesday at its $250 million project in North Las Vegas’ Apex Industrial Park. The company says the 25-acre plant can supply more than 40,000 “fuel cell” vehicles in California that are powered by hydrogen as opposed to gasoline.

It is Air Liquide’s largest liquid hydrogen production site in the world.

“This is (an) incredible footprint that they’ve got here; they’re making an enormous investment,” Gov. Steve Sisolak told the Review-Journal at the event.

Mike Graff, chairman and CEO of American Air Liquide Holdings, said the facility is fully operational and got up and running over the course of the last month.

“Logistically, it’s easy for us to serve a large part of the western United States from here,” he said, noting that Interstate 15 runs just outside the plant.

Like electric cars, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles use an electric motor instead of an internal combustion engine, though instead of running on rechargeable batteries, fuel cell cars generate electricity by combining hydrogen gas from the fuel tank with oxygen from the air, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

Fuel cell cars are available from several automakers in select markets, primarily California, the agency says.

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, California has 47 hydrogen fueling stations, Hawaii has one, and every other state, including Nevada, has none.

Cryogenic trailers

Paris-based Air Liquide, which boasts a presence in 75 countries and around 66,400 employees, unveiled plans for the North Las Vegas facility in 2019.

The project is a densely packed network of pipes, exhaust ducts, burners, compressors, refrigeration chambers, storage containers and other equipment.

Dave Edwards, director and advocate for hydrogen energy for Air Liquide, said the facility pipes in methane and steam, which break down into hydrogen and other gasses through a high-temperature-induced chemical reaction.

The hydrogen is separated and then liquefied in large refrigeration units at about minus 500 degrees Fahrenheit, he said.

As he further explained, the product is ultimately routed to on-site cryogenic trailers — double-walled, vacuum-lined vessels — and hauled off by truck drivers.

‘Decades-old problem solved’

The facility is part of a cluster of new projects and land sales in the southern edge of Apex over the last few years.

Reno developer Dermody Properties broke ground late last year on a 664,300-square-foot distribution facility near Air Liquide’s site, and supermarket chain Smith’s purchased almost 100 acres nearby in 2021 as well.

It’s also near a spread of land purchased by aluminum beverage can maker Ball Corp., which unveiled plans last year for a new facility that would span more than 750,000 square feet, and near roughly 350 acres that developer VanTrust Real Estate bought last year with plans for a 4.5 million-square-foot industrial complex.

Located some 20 miles northeast of the Strip, Apex has been around for decades and offers thousands of acres for potential projects. But the remote industrial park plodded along for years with little development, largely because of a dearth of utility service and other infrastructure, real estate pros have said.

However, the recent surge of activity follows the launch of a water-pipeline project from the city of North Las Vegas and Western States Contracting CEO Weston Adams, who has extensive land holdings in the park.

When the city announced the 12-mile surface pipeline’s groundbreaking ceremony in summer 2018, its news release highlighted the need for basic utilities, saying: “Decades-old problem solved: Water coming to North Las Vegas’ Apex Industrial Park.”

The pipeline was designed to serve the southern area of Apex.

Air Liquide Inaugurates its World’s Largest Liquid Hydrogen Production Facility in the US - Pipeline Technology Journal,"Mon, 30 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBpcGVsaW5lLWpvdXJuYWwubmV0L25ld3MvYWlyLWxpcXVpZGUtaW5hdWd1cmF0ZXMtaXRzLXdvcmxkcy1sYXJnZXN0LWxpcXVpZC1oeWRyb2dlbi1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLWZhY2lsaXR5LXVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French gas firm Air Liquide on Tuesday, May 24, commissioned its largest liquid hydrogen facility in North Las Vegas, Nevada.



According to the company, the facility, which cost the firm $250 million, will supply the growing demand for hydrogen mobility in California and nearby states and position Nevada as a leader in hydrogen energy production and supply.



The facility began operations in April 2022 after it was piloted last year and opened up job opportunities for some 700 contractors and 25 full-time workers, operating at full capacity. The firm also developed the necessary infrastructure to attract companies to the area, creating more jobs and revenue streams for North Las Vegas city and Nevada.



Air Liquide said its largest liquid hydrogen plant would produce up to 30 tons of liquid hydrogen per day, especially for customers in the clean mobility market on the West Coast, particularly in California.



Although the firm will fully utilize renewable power in its operations, it could also use renewable natural gas to meet California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) to supply hydrogen mobility to California. When fully operational, the facility can produce enough renewable hydrogen to keep 40,000 fuel cell electric vehicles on the road in California.



Increasing Hydrogen Footprint



While demand for the clean mobility market continues to grow, the plant will also sell its hydrogen to other sectors that provide a range of renewable and low carbon options to its customers.



Present at the launch were Air Liquide executives and employees, Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak, North Las Vegas Mayor John J Lee, Nevada Congressman Steven Horsford, and other local and state leaders. The US Secretary of Energy, Jennifer Granholm, gave a special recorded welcome message.



The North Las Vegas hydrogen facility will accelerate hydrogen development and contribute to Air Liquide’s target of tripling hydrogen sales to reach €6 billion ($6.5 billion) by 2035.



“Air Liquide has supported the clean mobility market on the west coast since its infancy, and the North Las Vegas facility is a milestone in our decade-long leadership of the US hydrogen market. This facility illustrates our commitment and ability to usher sustainable markets into the future while creating jobs and fostering economic growth in the present.



By providing a reliable supply of hydrogen to California’s mobility market and the region’s industrial customers, we are making a significant transition towards a more sustainable future, one with hydrogen at its core,” said American Air Liquide Holding Inc. Chairman and CEO Michael Graff."
"NASA, Air Liquide continue working on Artemis 1 WDR issues - NASASpaceFlight.com - NASASpaceflight.com","Mon, 16 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hc2FzcGFjZWZsaWdodC5jb20vMjAyMi8wNS9uYXNhLWFpci1saXF1aWRlLWFydGVtaXMtMS13ZHIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NASA’s Artemis 1 flight vehicle remains in the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida while work to investigate and fix problems found in April at the launch pad continues. A series of issues were discovered during three attempts to perform the Wet Dress Rehearsal (WDR) while the Orion spacecraft and Space Launch System (SLS) rocket were out at Launch Pad 39B.

While the Exploration Ground Systems (EGS) program and prime launch processing contractor Jacobs are troubleshooting issues with connections from the Mobile Launcher to the vehicle in the VAB, they are also working with gaseous nitrogen (GN2) contractor Air Liquide to verify that the purge gas supply can meet the flow rate and duration requirements to support an SLS launch attempt. The GN2 purge supply necessary to allow the vehicle to be loaded with propellant was lost on both tanking attempts in April and a 32-hour long test at the high SLS flow rates was planned to begin on May 16 to demonstrate the effectiveness of repairs and upgrades at the Air Liquide plant.

Tentative plans to roll back out to the pad for the next WDR attempt late in May will depend on how much longer the rework and retesting take.

Engineers troubleshooting SLS second stage issues while GN2 plant tests repairs

Crawler Transporter 2 returned the Orion/SLS vehicle and Mobile Launcher-1 to High Bay 3 of the VAB early on the morning of April 26. Rollback of the vehicle from Pad 39B to the VAB was always planned for Artemis 1 before launch; however, it had been hoped only one pre-launch rollback would be necessary. Now an additional rollback will be necessary after fully completing the Wet Dress Rehearsal countdown demonstration test.

The vehicle and Mobile Launcher were rolled back to the VAB to work their issues in parallel with Air Liquide’s repairs and upgrades, which are now required before the SLS rocket can be completed fueled. The VAB serves as the primary service structure for SLS launch operations, and so rolling back also offered the opportunity to troubleshoot other issues found at the pad in March and April.

Troubleshooting on an issue with the umbilical for the SLS Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS) was continuing and could factor into extending the stay in the VAB deeper into May. Air intrusion was detected into the purge line on the ICPS umbilical (ICPSU) while the vehicle was at the pad.

“On the ICPS purge boot, the teams are still meeting as to exactly what is going on with that particular item,” Cliff Lanham, senior vehicle operations manager for NASA’s EGS Program, said in a May 12 interview with NASASpaceflight. “We are anticipating some design [modifications].”

The purge boot is a part on the aft plate of the ICPSU, which has a forward and an aft plate connection from the Mobile Launcher to the stage. “We’ll go implement the final outcome of the engineering boards and the review boards in terms of exactly what we’re going to do we’re waiting for now and then we’re hoping to pick that work up early next week (week of May 16).”

A check valve in the gaseous helium system on the ICPS had also stopped functioning correctly between the second attempt on April 4 and the third on April 14. The ICPS serves as an in-space second stage for SLS and the helium system is used for multiple functions on the stage on the ground and in-flight, including purging lines and tanks and actuating Main Propulsion System (MPS) valves.

The issue with the ICPS helium check valve turned out to be a symptom of a problem elsewhere in the ground to vehicle helium connection. Following some maintenance on the ground side helium systems at the launch pad in between the second and third WDR attempts, the check valve would no longer close.

The check valve is only accessible when the vehicle is in the VAB and when workers were able to inspect it a piece of rubber not associated with the valve was found stuck there, preventing the check valve from operating correctly. “They found particulate in the check valve; that was what was holding the check valve open,” Lanham said.

“The failure analysis is still ongoing as to what exactly happened. The leading candidate for the source of the contamination is an O-ring on the flight-side quick disconnect and again the team is off and running that down.”

Parts of the rubber seal that was part of the quick disconnect were found downstream in a couple of places, including the check valve. “There was [also] some particulate [found] in the manifold, but all those parts have either been replaced or cleaned at this point,” Lanham noted.

Troubleshooting on that issue is now focused on why the seal failed and how to prevent future failures. “The failure mode of that seal is what is being looked at,” Lanham said.

“We’re hoping to have that out-briefed tomorrow (May 13), so we know the path forward as far as getting back into the final installation of the system, which is mostly installed but we’ll be doing the final torquing of the interfaces once we get the go-ahead.”

In addition to the issues encountered with the ICPS second stage, a hydrogen leak on a tail service mast umbilical (TSMU) for the Core Stage was discovered on the third WDR attempt, resulting in the scrub of that attempt on April 14. The leak was detected inside a “purge can” that enclosed the main hydrogen fluid lines that run into and out of the Core Stage.

An eight-inch diameter fill and drain line provides the main pathway for LH2 to flow into and out of the stage and a four-inch diameter bleed line provides an exit path for liquid hydrogen that helps chill down Main Propulsion System (MPS) and RS-25 engine lines inside the Core Stage engine section.

(Photo Caption: The American flag is seen on the ICPS second stage of the Artemis 1 SLS vehicle while out at Pad 39B on April 21. Issues with connections from ICPS Umbilical on the Mobile Launcher (to the right of the stage) are being reviewed by engineering boards to determine corrective actions. A helium check valve on the stage was contaminated with parts of a rubber O-ring that came apart upstream of the valve and prevented the valve from fully closing. Engineers are also troubleshooting outside air that is leaking into one of the connections from the umbilical to the ICPS.)

After the two-piece, clamshell purge can was disconnected and removed back inside the VAB, the bolts on a flange for the fill and drain line were found not as tightly torqued as expected. “That’s why as far as a potential cause, this is certainly a potential cause,” Lanham said.

“You’re dealing with hydrogen, [so] if you have any kind of leak path, it’s going to find it. [And] they did find some backing off [of the torques on the bolts].”

The bolted flange is around a debris plate, with gaskets on either side. “We think we’ve done what we can do as far as retorquing the flange bolts, and then they do a 30-hour retorque after that just to see if there’s been any relaxation if you will,” Lanham said.

“They went through that on a couple different cycles trying to get to the point where they didn’t see any more of that. Basically, they would go back in [after 30 hours] and see if they could turn the bolts further.”

Future plans are to verify the torque on the bolts more frequently, but Lanham noted “we won’t know if we fixed the problem until we get out there,” when the team repeats the LH2 propellant loading sequence next time out at the pad. In addition to retorquing the flange bolts on similar connections on the liquid oxygen tail service mast and the Core Stage Inter-Tank Umbilical, a May 13 NASA blog post also noted the relocation of filters on both tail service mast umbilicals.

“As a precaution, teams also moved the location of a heavy cantilevered filter on the tail service mast umbilical, which filters out any contaminants in the gaseous helium — a purge gas — that travels through the drain assist purge line. Engineers did not identify any leaks at its previous location, but relocating the filter will ensure it does not contribute to future leaks,” the blog post said.

The tail service masts are one of the few areas that can be serviced at the pad, so it’s possible that the bolts could have been retightened out at Pad 39B for another Wet Dress Rehearsal attempt instead of rolling back to the VAB first. Initial plans following the scrub on April 14 were to do just that, stay at the pad and troubleshoot the hydrogen leak; however, the gaseous nitrogen purge supply outages that occurred on April 4 and April 14 called into question the ability to run hours of testing with cryogenic propellants to find and/or fix the leak.

A continuous flow of gaseous nitrogen is required to keep the areas of the SLS vehicle inerted before, during, and after hazardous propellant operations, and the repairs and upgrades at the Air Liquide plant weren’t expected to be completed for a few weeks. Due to the busy launch schedule at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (CCSFS) and KSC, the maintenance work at the GN2 plant just outside the KSC gates didn’t start until the end of April.

At the time of the May 12 interview, Lanham said that the repair and upgrade work was complete, and a multi-day series of verification tests were underway. “With the Air Liquide plant right now they’re actually into their portion of the testing,” he said. “We’re hoping they can wrap that up in the next day or so.”

Following the repairs and upgrades, plans were for Air Liquide to first perform high flow verification tests at the plant and then out to launch pads at CCSFS and KSC. Assuming those tests were completed successfully, an SLS stress test would follow.

The 32-hour “demand and endurance” test for SLS will flow GN2 “end to end,” from the off-site plant all the way to the 39B pad surface, requiring the area to be cleared. “Our technical management team has worked with Air Liquide and our facility management director here to develop test procedures that will allow us to exercise the system in a way that will basically stress it more than we would expect during our WDR and launch campaign,” Lanham said during a May 5 media teleconference.

“They’ve added margin to ensure the flow rates can be met. The test will actually run for 32 hours and that’s about a 10 percent margin over what we would expect to need during the actual launch campaign.”

“We’ll basically put dampers out at the interface to the Mobile Launcher and be able to adjust and regulate to ensure we’re getting the back pressures that the Mobile Launcher and vehicle would put on the system, again in an effort to make sure we’re stressing the system to meet our needs,” he added.

(Photo Caption: Ground test instrumentation can be seen fastened to the outside of the Orion Launch Abort System during the first March 17 rollout from the VAB to Pad 39B. Some rainwater leaked through temporary seals around the rectangular opening on a LAS fillet panel above its hatch (seen with circular window) but the intrusion was minor, and no damage was observed inside.)

During the May 12 interview Lanham noted, “we’re getting into our pre-test briefing tomorrow [May 13] with the full anticipation of starting our testing on Monday (May 16); it’s a 32-hour test.”

Although the GN2 plant repairs could be validated during the week of May 16, there is more uncertainty about when the vehicle and Mobile Launcher issues will be resolved. Sources have reported a range of possible rollout dates during the week of May 23, but EGS and Jacobs are also looking for additional work they could do if engineering discussions and reviews about the ICPS and ICPS umbilical issues run longer.

There was some anticipation that the VAB platforms extended around the vehicle would begin to be retracted this week, but for now, it’s been decided to leave them in place in case other work is added during this current stay in the VAB. “We decided today (May 12) we’ll wait until next week before we contemplate any platform retractions, because again our whole goal will be to do whatever additional work we can do in the time-frame needed to do any changes to the ICPSU,” Lanham said.

In early May, the tentative plan had been to roll back out to Pad 39B towards the end of May for another WDR attempt in early to mid-June. If the WDR was completed satisfactorily then, it could be possible to have the vehicle ready to fly during Artemis 1 lunar launch opportunities in or after August.

Fitting other work into the VAB schedule

EGS and Jacobs have already completed other tasks in parallel with the main issues found during the WDR attempts in April, but instead of comprehensive pre-launch preparations this extra rollback has been called a “pit stop,” and the other work is a mixture of secondary issues found out at the pad and some planned for pre-launch tasks.

One of the tasks that the Integrated Operations team in the VAB completed in parallel with troubleshooting the hydrogen leak and check valve issues was removing test instrumentation on the outer mold line of the vehicle and parts of the Mobile Launcher as a part of the Dynamic Rollout Test (DRT). As planned, two sets of data were collected during the rollout in mid-March and the rollback in late April.

“From an instrumentation standpoint, we’re fully expecting to wrap up removing all the ground instrumentation from the vehicle and the Mobile Launcher this week, we’re nearly done [with] that work,” Lanham said during the May 12 interview. “So we’re anticipating wrapping that up this week.”

The return to the VAB also allowed a couple of other issues noted at the pad to be addressed. One was water intrusion around some of the ground test instrumentation deployed on Orion’s Launch Abort System (LAS) fairing for the rollout tests.

(Photo Caption: Red tape can be seen on the visible Core Stage engine blankets in this April 1 image. The blankets have an outer plastic covering to keep water out, but the red tape was used to hold down the plastic covering in high winds outside.)

“We definitely try to environmentally protect as much as possible but while we were out there for WDR we had some significant rain events that drove some water intrusion,” Lanham said. The LAS has two sets of aerodynamic fairings, a four-panel, ogive-shaped part that covers the Orion Crew Module (CM), and two fillet panels that encapsulate the abort motor tower above it.

Some water got into the ground access doors on the fillet panels during heavy rain while the vehicle was on the pad. “We pulled off the GSE (Ground Support Equipment) panels and did some inspections to ensure we didn’t have any kind of water damage, which we did not,” Lanham said. “We’ve opened up the LAS hatch and we’re doing some additional inspections around the CM thrusters which did not show any indications of water issues.”

Now that the rollout test data is collected and the test instrumentation is removed, the flight access doors could be installed for launch and the seams around the doors could be more thoroughly sealed with a room temperature vulcanized (RTV). “The [flight] plates get bolted in and then there’s RTV around the perimeter to close it out, multiple layers of RTV,” Lanham noted.

“Now the flight plates are up, they get RTV and all in all that work is behind us.”

Another area that got some rework was the engine-mounted heat shield (EMHS) blankets on the SLS Core Stage. The Core Stage spent over a year outdoors at Stennis Space Center for its Green Run campaign, but it was surrounded and partially shielded by the B-2 Test Stand structure there.

Out at Pad 39B, without any service structure around the vehicle, the blankets saw a lot more sea breeze winds off the nearby Atlantic Ocean. The flight blankets primarily provide a thermal barrier to protect the powerheads of the four RS-25 engines from the heat generated by the engines and two Solid Rocket Boosters (SRB) during launch, but they also have a thin, plastic outer layer to keep water off of the blanket material.

Some of the plastic ended up getting buffeted in the wind at the pad. “The wind was pretty intense out of the east blowing across there and there was extra material, so it flapped a lot and then we did get some tears,” Lanham said. While out at the pad, Lanham said the extra material was taped down.

“They did a good job, we didn’t experience any more issues but when we got back to the VAB what we did was take that tape off and they repaired the weather coverings and so next time we roll out you won’t see the red tape,” he said. In addition to the flight closeouts on the Orion LAS fillet panels, other areas could be closed out with the rollout test instrumentation removed.

“We’ve done a lot of sealant work, it’s part of the environmental systems tunnel on the Boosters,” Lanham explained. “We’ve done some of that closeout work on the Boosters with that. On Orion, we’re installing the SM (Service Module) oxidizer panel, again for flight.”

With the possibility that modifications to the ICPS purge boot may add some time in the VAB before rolling out again, the team is looking for other pre-flight work they might do. “At this point, we’re considering other work,” Lanham said. “We’re trying to do as much as we can as time allots.”

“In anticipation of additional work coming out of the boot mods, we’re looking at going into the CM and doing additional work inside the capsule as we work the other areas.”

"Air Liquide, Lhoist ink deal to decarbonise Dunkirk lime industry - gasworld","Mon, 09 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdhc3dvcmxkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9haXItbGlxdWlkZS1saG9pc3QtaW5rLWRlYWwtdG8tZGVjYXJib25pc2UtZHVua2lyay1saW1lLWluZHVzdHJ5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide, Lhoist ink deal to decarbonise Dunkirk lime industry

The notoriously hard-to-abate lime industry in France’s Dunkirk area is set to undergo a decarbonisation drive following a deal signed between Air Liquide and lime producer Lhoist, which aims to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions at France’s largest lime production plant located in the Hauts-de-France region by more than 600,000 tonnes per year.

A Memorandum of Understanding between the two companies will see the industrial gas giant provide its Cryocap carbon capture technology to capture and purify 95% of the CO2 emitted from Lhoist’s existing lime production unit in Réty, marking the first instance of its use to decarbonise lime production in France.

Once captured, the gas will be transported to a multimodal CO2 export hub currently under development in the area, before being permanently stored in the North Sea as part of the D’Artagnan project.

Admitting that decarbonisation of industry is ‘at the heart’ of its company strategy, Pascal Vinet, Senior Vice President, member of the Air Liquide Executive Committee, supervising Europe Industries, added, “Our partnership with Lhoist will contribute to the decarbonisation of the broader Dunkirk industrial basin, one of Air Liquide’s historical industrial basins in France.”"

The facility aims to supply the growing needs for hydrogen mobility, but will also allow to provide hydrogen to a wide array of industries while the mobility market continues to mature.

The facility, and the associated logistics infrastructure, marks a $250 million investment by Air Liquide in the US hydrogen market and will position Nevada as a leader in hydrogen energy production. Air Liquide’s investment created jobs for 700 contractors and 25 full-time jobs with the plant at full capacity. With this facility, Air Liquide also developed the infrastructure necessary to attract other companies to move into the area, creating additional jobs and new revenue for the city of North Las Vegas and the state of Nevada.

The North Las Vegas facility will produce 30 tn/day of liquid hydrogen which will be utilized by various customers, notably by those in the growing clean mobility market on the West Coast, especially California. The facility will be powered by fully renewable electricity. The facility can also use renewable natural gas to meet the California Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) when supplying the California mobility market. In this context, the facility can provide enough renewable hydrogen for over 40,000 fuel cell vehicles in California. This will significantly improve the hydrogen supply for mobility, a critical enabler for market growth. While the clean mobility market continues to mature, the plant configuration will also allow for the sale of hydrogen to a wide array of sectors with a range of renewable and low-carbon options for customers.

Air Liquide executives and employees were joined by local, state and federal leaders for the event including Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, Congressman Steven Horsford (NV-4), North Las Vegas Mayor John J. Lee, with a special recorded welcome message from U.S. Sec. of Energy Jennifer Granholm and U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), who visited the facility earlier in the month.

“Air Liquide has supported the clean mobility market on the west coast since its infancy and the North Las Vegas facility is a milestone in our decades-long leadership of the U.S. hydrogen market. This facility is an illustration of our commitment, and ability, to usher sustainable markets into the future, while creating jobs and fostering economic growth in the present,” said Michael Graff, Chairman & CEO of American Air Liquide Holdings, Inc. and Executive Vice President, Air Liquide Group, in a release. “By providing a reliable supply of hydrogen to California’s mobility market and the region’s industrial customers, we are making a significant investment in the transition towards a more sustainable future, one with hydrogen at its core.”

In alignment with Air Liquide’s Sustainability Objectives, the North Las Vegas liquid hydrogen production facility aims to accelerate hydrogen development and contribute to the Group’s goal of at least tripling hydrogen sales in order to reach nearly $6.5 billion by 2035."
Data and artificial intelligence driving Industry 4.0 - Air Liquide,"Mon, 16 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvdGFsZW50cy9kYXRhLWFuZC1hcnRpZmljaWFsLWludGVsbGlnZW5jZS1kcml2aW5nLWluZHVzdHJ5LTQw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Industry is at the heart of the major economic and climate challenges that require a fundamental review of production activities. To meet these challenges, in the same way as those that led to the steam and electricity revolutions, data and AI are transforming plants, production and distribution methods. They open up a wide range of opportunities and offer extensive potential across all aspects of industry.

As a result, we are seeing smart plants, which are capable of managing their performance in an agile manner while reducing their carbon footprint. Air Liquide has been part of this ""4th industrial revolution"" for several years. The Group is a key player, as its Chief Data Officer Bruno Aïdan explains.

If you want to continue and play the video, you must give us your consent by clicking on the button below. I accept - Launch the video What is happening in industry in terms of data and artificial intelligence? Are we seeing a revolution? Yes, an industrial revolution is underway! Today for example, a smart plant is made up of physical components as well as a layer of software that includes AI models, all of which is led by teams of committed technicians and engineers. At Air Liquide, data is at the heart of our operations, with 3.5 billion data points collected each day in each of our 600 production plants across the globe, from our 10,000 trucks and 24 million gas cylinders in circulation. Plus the data collected from our customers. Data is a strategic asset for our Group. In this respect, for example, we have a subsidiary dedicated to the industrial IoT (Internet of Things), as well as a department within Digital & IT that is entirely focused on data storage and processing, and the development of new digital services for our employees and our customers.

In practical terms, how does data change your operations? It changes everything! Data expertise is now a key skill at Air Liquide and is as important as our long-standing technological and industrial know-how. Data drives our descriptive analyses, which describe what has happened in our operations and business lines, but also, and above all, prescriptive analysis, used to anticipate events that define these same operations and business lines. Moreover, the 3.5 billion data points that we process are such as to allow us to build increasingly efficient algorithms. In short, leveraging data and artificial intelligence allows us to achieve operational excellence and excellence in service for our customers and patients. We continuously adapt to changes in their needs through innovative solutions, for ever greater efficiency. Data and artificial intelligence provide us with a clear competitive advantage.

The teams have artificial intelligence and data resources, what does this mean in practice? At Air Liquide, artificial intelligence and data are at the service of our employees. They are valuable daily allies, as they help with making the right decisions and streamlining processes. In terms of data scientists, data analysts and business analysts, Air Liquide offers the opportunity to work at the heart of operations and apply data to tangibly contribute to the industry of the future. What I mean by that is the ability provided to the teams to be able to do things more quickly and more precisely, to free up energy and unleash creativity. For example, we have maintenance teams that are able to manage our assets and tools by forecasting what will happen in the weeks and months ahead: allowing us to maximize value and gain a competitive advantage.

“ Data is a way of achieving our sustainable development objectives and it contributes to the objectives of our new ADVANCE strategic plan. ” Bruno Aïdan Chief Data Officer

Data, seen in that way, is therefore a performance enhancer, right? Yes, it is, and much more. Data is also a way of achieving our sustainable development objectives. It contributes to the objectives of our new ADVANCE strategic plan, which reiterates Air Liquide’s commitment to the decarbonization of industry. For example: through our liquid gas supply chain digitalization program, we collect massive amounts of data. Predictive analysis of customer demand, and supply and delivery optimization allow us to reduce our carbon footprint while at the same time ensuring operating performance. By 2025, we aim to reduce the number of kilometers driven by our trucks by 10%. Last but not least, all of these measures also contribute to the sustainable development objectives of our partners and of society in general. Data and artificial intelligence also contribute to improving the quality of life of patients. Air Liquide is a major healthcare player; the Group provides support to 1.8 million chronically ill patients in their homes and develops medical gases and related services for 15,000 hospitals and new care facilities. Data and AI are powerful drivers of the personalization of the continuum of care for patients, carers and healthcare management professionals (social security and private health insurers); they aim to improve the quality of life of patients, while at the same time managing costs in an appropriate manner. Again, in healthcare, but on a different level, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, our algorithms were able to predict changes in demand for oxygen in hospitals by combining public data on current trends in COVID-19 cases in several countries under pressure with internal data in order to adapt gas production and its supply. Moreover, for patients suffering from chronic respiratory diseases and cared for in their homes via connected medical devices, algorithms are used to identify the risk of non-adherence of a specific patient and thus adapt that patient’s support in a predictive manner. In this way, we therefore adapt resources according to each patient’s needs at a given time.

What other changes have data and artificial intelligence brought about at Air Liquide? Digital solutions change the daily lives of our customers and patients. The same is true for our employees. With our tech-savvy culture, the appeal of integrating data expertise into our business on a daily basis is strong. We have launched AI Readiness, an internal program that notably includes an artificial intelligence training component. For example, operational employees working in the field have received programming, statistics and modeling training. Our aim is to train 300 data scientists and analysts who work at the heart of our operations. We also organize data challenge competitions for our employees. These aim to predict events based on data sets provided to participants. Employees are delighted to share, learn, test and present their ideas. And that is how data inspires them to innovate in new ways!

What about young talents, young graduates? Around 10 years ago, new graduates were drawn to start-ups, e-commerce and digital pure players. Today, we are seeing a different trend with the strong appeal of industry. They are keen to contribute to technological progress by using their skills at industrial groups like Air Liquide. This is combined with the desire to make a meaningful contribution to sustainable development objectives, the ability to build trust with our patients and customers. Data-related talent is initially found in our Digital & IT departments and in R&D, at our Innovation Campuses. Today, they can also be present more widely across the Group, working alongside all employees in daily operational roles, at our plants (production, maintenance, supply chain, etc.) and in customer relation roles."

Air Liquide and Lhoist Join Forces to Launch a First-of-its-Kind Decarbonization Project of Lime Production in France - Business Wire,"Mon, 09 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIyMDUwODAwNTAzMy9lbi9BaXItTGlxdWlkZS1hbmQtTGhvaXN0LUpvaW4tRm9yY2VzLXRvLUxhdW5jaC1hLUZpcnN0LW9mLWl0cy1LaW5kLURlY2FyYm9uaXphdGlvbi1Qcm9qZWN0LW9mLUxpbWUtUHJvZHVjdGlvbi1pbi1GcmFuY2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:

Air Liquide (Paris:AI) and Lhoist have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the aim to decarbonize Lhoist’s lime production plant located in Réty, in the Hauts-de-France region, using Air Liquide’s innovative and proprietary CryocapTM carbon capture technology. In this context, Air Liquide and Lhoist have jointly applied for the European Innovation Fund large scale support scheme. This partnership is a new step in the creation of a low-carbon industrial ecosystem in the broader Dunkirk area.

Lime is one of the “hard-to-abate” industries as its production primarily generates CO 2 from decomposition of limestone. The “Chaux et Dolomies du Boulonnais” Lhoist’s site in Réty is France’s largest lime production plant. Thanks to this project, Lhoist would be able to reduce the CO 2 emissions of the plant in Réty by more than 600,000 tons per year starting in 2028. This is equivalent to the annual emissions of about 55,000 households in France.

Leveraging its know-how and unique expertise in CO 2 capture technologies, Air Liquide would build and operate a unit of its innovative and proprietary CryocapTM FG (Flue Gas) technology to capture and purify 95% of the CO 2 arising from Lhoist’s existing lime production unit in Réty. Air Liquide’s CryocapTM technology would thus be used for the first time to decarbonize lime production in France.

The captured CO 2 would then be transported to a multimodal CO 2 export hub1 in Dunkirk, currently under development, and sent to be sequestered in the North Sea as part of the D’Artagnan project, which has received the PCI (Project of Common Interest) label from the European Commission.

The implementation of the project will be possible as public funding from European and/or French schemes supporting decarbonization become available. In this perspective, Air Liquide and Lhoist have jointly applied for the European Innovation Fund large scale call.

Pascal Vinet, Senior Vice President, a member of the Air Liquide Executive Committee, supervising Europe Industries, said: “Decarbonizing the Industry is at the heart of Air Liquide’s strategy and we are committed to accompanying our customers with a wide range of solutions, in line with our Sustainability Development objectives. Using CryocapTM to decarbonize lime production demonstrates the versatility of our innovative and proprietary carbon capture technology. Our partnership with Lhoist will contribute to the decarbonization of the broader Dunkirk industrial basin, one of Air Liquide's historical industrial basins in France.""

Cedric De Vicq, Lhoist CEO Europe, said: “As a leader in the lime industry, we are very proud that for the first time, a lime plant will capture its CO 2 emissions and store them in safe conditions. Carbon Capture & Storage is an indispensable part of how the lime industry addresses the reduction of its CO 2 footprint for the benefit of the environment and its customers.”

Coons and Blunt-Rochester show support for new zero-emission technology - Delaware First Media,"Mon, 02 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWxhd2FyZXB1YmxpYy5vcmcvc2NpZW5jZS1oZWFsdGgtdGVjaC8yMDIyLTA1LTAyL2Nvb25zLWFuZC1ibHVudC1yb2NoZXN0ZXItc2hvdy1zdXBwb3J0LWZvci1uZXctemVyby1lbWlzc2lvbi10ZWNobm9sb2d50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles have debuted in California, but need a hydrogen hub to refuel, but Air Liquide and Toyota are working to make that happen in Delaware.

The two companies created the Mirai, a zero-emission vehicle that runs on hydrogen-cell technology. And because hydrogen has the highest energy content of any fuel on the market, it could replace diesel.

Sen. Chris Coons drove a heavy-duty hydrogen-cell truck around the Air Liquide Innovation Campus Monday, and Rep. Lisa Blunt-Rochester test drove a Mirai to highlight and support the use of hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles.

“Elegant, efficient, economical, I’m trying to think of every E-word I can think of, and easy to drive,"" Blunt-Rochester said after stepping out of the Mirai. ""Wow, that was great.”

Coons, and Texas Republican Senator John Coryn are champions of the Hydrogen Infrastructure Initiative, a package of bills to support the technology and cut emissions in troublesome areas.

“These commercial scale demonstrations show that it is possible,"" Coons said. ""And that hydrogen really can be the clean energy fuel of the future.”

Hydrogen powered vehicles, much like gasoline powered vehicles, can’t be refueled at home the way electric vehicles are, so an infrastructure of hydrogen hubs must be built before cars like the Mirai can hit the market in the First State.

Hydrogen fuel-cell technology is so versatile it can potentially pop up in aviation, power plants, construction vehicles, and more, as a clean substitute for gasoline and diesel.

And Air Liquide North America president Katie Ellet, President says it’s not meant to compete with battery electric and fuel cell electric

“There are applications where the batteries make total sense,"" Ellet said. ""If you have a passenger car and you drive 40 miles or less a day, that's a good application, especially if you have a place to plug in every day. But for long-haul, for heavier payloads, for places where power or climate, cold climates and such, fuel cells make absolutely, quite a bit more sense.”

She adds that the Mirai and other hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles are not expected to hit the market until 2025."

Southwest Gas to raise rates, but insists customers will see lower bills

A French energy giant is set to hold a grand opening this month for a $250 million plant in North Las Vegas.

Air Liquide, which says its new facility in Apex Industrial Park is the largest hydrogen-production facility in the U.S., is slated to hold a ribbon-cutting event May 24.

The plant is expected to produce 30 tons of liquid hydrogen per day and supply “fuel cell” vehicles that are powered by hydrogen as opposed to gasoline.

Mike Graff, chairman and CEO of American Air Liquide Holdings, said in a statement to the Review-Journal that the plant is the company’s largest such project globally to supply hydrogen energy to the “mobility market.”

It will produce liquid hydrogen in North Las Vegas to meet the “growing demand” in California, Graff said, adding the plant has the capacity to supply more than 40,000 fuel cell vehicles in that state.

“While California’s mobility market matures, the plant allows for the sale of hydrogen to other customers in the region with a range of renewable and low-carbon options,” he said.

According to Graff, Air Liquide invested $250 million in the facility.

Like electric cars, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles use an electric motor instead of an internal combustion engine, though instead of running on rechargeable batteries, fuel cell cars generate electricity by combining hydrogen gas from the fuel tank with oxygen from the air, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

Fuel cell cars are available from several automakers in select markets, primarily California, the agency says.

California has 47 hydrogen fueling stations, Hawaii has one, and every other state, including Nevada, has none, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

Paris-based Air Liquide, which unveiled plans for the North Las Vegas facility in 2019, boasts a presence in 75 countries and around 66,400 employees.

Pertamina - Air Liquide Agree to Collaborate in Developing CCU Technology at the Balikpapan Refinery - Pertamina,"Tue, 17 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wZXJ0YW1pbmEuY29tL2VuL25ld3Mtcm9vbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2UvcGVydGFtaW5hLWFpci1saXF1aWRlLWFncmVlLXRvLWNvbGxhYm9yYXRlLWluLWRldmVsb3BpbmctY2N1LXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktYXQtdGhlLWJhbGlrcGFwYW4tcmVmaW5lcnnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris, May 17, 2022 - Pertamina and Air Liquide Indonesia agreed to collaborate in developing Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) technology at the Balikpapan Refinery Processing Unit.

It is a form of Pertamina's commitment to implementing Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) aspects and supporting Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions reduction.

This cooperation agreement was realized through a Joint Study Agreement (JSA) signing by the President Director of Pertamina, Nicke Widyawati, and President Director of PT Air Liquide Indonesia, Marloes Moerman, in Paris, France, Tuesday, 17 May 2022.

Present at the signing of this collaboration were Deputy Minister of BUMN I, Pahala Nugraha Mansury, Group CEO of Air Liquide, François Jackow, and VP for European and International Affairs, Laurent Dublanchet.

Within the framework of this JSA, Pertamina and Air Liquide will conduct a joint study on CO2 Syngas and Flue Gas capture technology application from Hydrogen production in the Balikpapan Refinery area.

The captured CO2 emissions will be compressed and channeled to a potential CO2 storage area in the Kutai Basin, East Kalimantan, as a solution for low-carbon Hydrogen production or Blue Hydrogen.

Some of the CO2 will also be converted into value-added products, Methanol which can be mixed with fuel oil for the low-carbon fuel production.

Deputy Minister I of State-Owned Enterprises, Pahala Nugraha Mansury, said that the government has committed to reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and Net Zero emissions by 2060 as outlined in Presidential Regulation No. 98/2021. The Presidential Regulation is translated into 48 derivative rules, and several regulations are being drafted, such as National Determined Contribution (NDC) per sector, Carbon Economic Value, and Carbon Tax.

""The Ministry of SOEs has committed to start decarbonization and actively leading the decarbonization agenda with three initiative pillars, which includes reducing end-to-end emission, building adjacent businesses, and exploring step-out opportunities,"" said Pahala.

According to Pahala, this initiative has an aggressive target of reducing around 85 million tons of CO2e/year or contributing 10% to the National Determined Contribution in 2030.

""The CCUS technology application can increase oil and gas production while reducing greenhouse gas emissions significantly,"" added Pahala.

Pahala continued that the CCUS technology enables Pertamina's refineries to make available CO2 for either storage (CCS) or use (CCU) and integrates this sector into a circular economy.

President Director of Pertamina, Nicke Widyawati, said the Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) technology application is one of the initiatives to reduce carbon emissions from Pertamina’s refinery facilities, as well as a solution to increase oil and gas production in the energy transition era.

""Currently, the energy transition is a priority issue. Pertamina has played an important role in leading the transition of Indonesia's energy industry,"" said Nicke.

Nicke also added that Pertamina is targeting a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increasing the renewable energy mix from 9.2 percent in 2019 to 17.7 percent in 2030.

At the same time, Indonesia holds the G20 Presidency by prioritizing the transition to sustainable energy as one of the main issues.

""We hope that the signing of the JSA between Pertamina and Air Liquide will have a positive impact on accelerating the implementation of low-carbon technology and providing Low Carbon Energy Resilience in Indonesia,"" added Nicke.

Through this collaboration, it is hoped that it will accelerate green technology application in providing low-carbon energy while maintaining global climate change.**"
Toyota signs new agreement to increase hydrogen technology development - Jersey Evening Post,"Tue, 17 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmplcnNleWV2ZW5pbmdwb3N0LmNvbS9tb3RvcmluZy8yMDIyLzA1LzE3L3RveW90YS1zaWducy1uZXctYWdyZWVtZW50LXRvLWluY3JlYXNlLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toyota has signed a new memorandum of understanding with Air Liquide and CaetanoBus to help develop hydrogen systems in Europe.

Air Liquide – a France-based industrial gases and technology firm – and Portuguese bus and chassis manufacturer CaetanoBus will work with Toyota to ‘accelerate the expansion of hydrogen mobility for both light and heavy-duty vehicles’.

The trio will combine their efforts to ‘address the entire value chain of hydrogen mobility’, ranging from the renewable or low-carbon production of hydrogen right the way through to refuelling infrastructure. Their focus will initially be placed on buses, light commercial vehicles and cars, though hydrogen-powered heavy-duty trucks are said to be part of development plans later on too.

Toyota is one of two manufacturers that offers a hydrogen-powered vehicle in the UK, with its Mirai. The other is Hyundai’s Nexo, with both vehicles using stored hydrogen to generate electrical energy through a fuel cell. Currently, there are 14 hydrogen filling stations open to the public in the UK.

Air Liquide, @toyota_europe and CaetanoBus join forces to accelerate the development of #hydrogen mobility in Europe. The partnership includes the development of infrastructure and vehicle fleets, both for light mobility and heavy mobility. ? https://t.co/GfuEbanRdg pic.twitter.com/Sc5cf9HvyB — Air Liquide Group (@airliquidegroup) May 17, 2022

Matt Harrison, President and CEO at Toyota Motor Europe, comments: “We are excited by the opportunity to combine our strengths to expand the development of hydrogen clusters. Toyota’s role is to bring the hydrogen applications into the ecosystem and, by working together with our partners, we want to accelerate and intensify the use of hydrogen as a carbon neutral solution for mobility.”

Patrícia Vasconcelos, CEO of CaetanoBus, added: “It is a great pleasure to work on hydrogen projects with these partners and have the chance to reinforce the role of new forms of energy in the pursuit of a sustainable way of living.”"
