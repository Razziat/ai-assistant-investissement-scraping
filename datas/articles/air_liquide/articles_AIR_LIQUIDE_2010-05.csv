Research Shows Federal Oil Leasing and Royalty Income a Raw Deal for Taxpayers - InsideClimate News,"Tue, 18 May 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlY2xpbWF0ZW5ld3Mub3JnL25ld3MvMTgwNTIwMTAvcmVzZWFyY2gtc2hvd3MtZmVkZXJhbC1vaWwtbGVhc2luZy1hbmQtcm95YWx0eS1pbmNvbWUtcmF3LWRlYWwtdGF4cGF5ZXJzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON—Taxpayers are receiving significantly less of a bang for their buck from offshore oil development—even though energy companies have access to six times as many leases as they did in the early 1980s.

Statistics compiled by two researchers studying the last 30 years of leasing policy show that per-acre lease rates have plummeted almost nine-fold from shortly after the time Ronald Reagan assumed the presidency to the tail end of President George W. Bush’s second term.

An average of $2,224 per acre for all federal leases sold between 1954 and 1982 careened to $263 per acre for federal leases sold between 1983 and 2008.

And those eye-opening losses don’t even account for how inflation has eaten into the U.S. dollar during that time span.

The recent BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has prompted the researchers who published these findings almost a year ago, to again ask why Congress and the Department of the Interior’s Minerals Management Service (MMS) have been so reluctant to update a leasing program severely altered in favor of the oil industry, first in the early 1980s by James Watt, Reagan’s secretary of Interior, and later again under President Clinton.

“It seems to be a good time to follow the money,” Bill Freudenburg, one of the researchers, told SolveClimate in a telephone interview this week.

Freudenburg, who teaches in the Environmental Studies Program at the University of California, Santa Barbara, undertook the research with Bob Gramling, a professor of sociology at the University of Louisiana, Lafayette. They initially published their findings in the online version of Miller-McCune magazine last June.

“Initially, back when we started our number-crunching, this didn’t look good for the taxpayer,” Freudenburg said. “But we were really surprised at how bad it looks for the taxpayer.”

The professors’ tracking showed that 3,520 leases were sold at the $2,224 average rate, while 21,179 were sold at the $263 rate. Their research didn’t include total number of acres sold.

The duo started studying offshore leasing of public land for energy exploration in the middle and late 1980s when Freudenburg served on the MMS’s scientific advisory committee and Gramling was chosen to be on a committee the first President Bush asked the National Academy of Sciences to set up to examine offshore leasing issues in Florida and California.

How Did It Reach This Point?



Legislation passed in the 1950s designated the Department of the Interior as the agency to manage U.S. offshore lands. Before MMS was created in the early 1980s, each offshore lease sale offered only a limited number of blocks within an offshore area, Freudenburg says. He adds that block selection was based on a U.S. Geological Survey resource assessment.

“Since then, the leasing process has continued to evolve, almost completely privatizing the exploration for and the development and production of offshore energy resources,” Freudenburg and Gramling wrote in their Miller-McCune article. “The government decides on the quantity of land to be leased and sets out royalty rates. Otherwise, however, energy companies hold most of the cards, deciding which tracts to bid on and explore based on survey information only available to the largest of those companies.”

Two major switches to offshore policy, Freudenburg says, enabled the move toward reduced competition and bargain prices for energy companies. One was Watt’s early 1980s policy change to what’s called “area-wide” leasing and the second was the 1995 Outer Continental Shelf Deep Water Royalty Act. More on those two game-changers a little later.



How the Government Gets Its Money



First, Freudenburg says, taxpayers need to understand the two primary ways the federal government “earns” revenue from offshore lands. Competitive bonus bids give companies the right to carry out oil and gas exploration, while royalties are a percentage of the value of the oil or gas actually extracted.

What’s known as a “government take” in the offshore leasing industry is a combination of those bonuses and royalties, plus rent, corporate income tax and special fees and taxes.

A May 2007 Government Accountability Office report concluded that the U.S. federal government receives one of the lowest government takes on the globe. Results from five private sector studies presented in 2006 show that the U.S. government receives a lower government take from the production of oil in the Gulf of Mexico than do states—such as Colorado, Wyoming, Texas, Oklahoma, California and Louisiana—and dozens of foreign governments, according to the GAO report.

“At a minimum, we need to be looking at rates being paid in the rest of the world,” says Freudenburg, citing Norway as an example where the government take is high and the drilling is competitive. “The sensible thing to do is to make our rates that high. Then, later on, when the oil companies get more desperate, we’ll get a higher income from it.”

Authors of the GAO report emphasized that the United States must continue to create a market that is competitive in attracting investment in oil and natural gas development.

“Such development, however, should not mean that the American people forgo a competitive and fair rate of return for the extraction and sale of these natural resources, especially in light of the current and long-range fiscal challenges facing our nation,” the report stated. “The potential trade-offs between higher revenue collections and higher oil production highlight the broader challenge of striking a balance between meeting the nation’s increasing energy needs and ensuring a fair rate of return for the American people from oil production on federally leased lands and waters,” the authors continued.

Impact of Two Leasing Policy Game-Changers



Before 1983, the federal government would offer a limited number of “blocks” within an offshore area in each lease sale. Area-wide leasing, however, offered up all of a designated area such as the entire central Gulf of Mexico. The first area-wide sale offered up almost 38 million acres of ocean floor—shattering the block sale record of 2.8 million acres set in 1975.

“With entire areas being put up for sale every year, suddenly only the multinational oil companies had the economic resources to contract seismic surveys on most of those areas,” Freudenburg and Gramling wrote. “Area-wide leasing suppressed competition for offshore lands, allowing those in the know to offer minimal bids on promising blocks. More tracts were sold … with fewer bids per tract and at bargain-basement prices.”

Back in the early 1980s, Watt assured the public that area-wide environmental assessments and lease offerings of entire planning areas would encourage energy development, use tax dollars more efficiently and promote energy independence.

But Freudenburg and Gramling beg to differ.

“Area-wide leasing was a huge subsidy for major oil companies,” they agreed. “Whatever its other characteristics, what area-wide leasing seems to do best is to transfer huge swaths of public land into the hands of world’s largest oil companies at some of the world’s cheapest prices.”

Though 400 companies now own all or part of a federal offshore lease, Freudenberg says, only about 20 companies have more than half of those holdings.

And, they point out, this country now imports about twice as much oil as it did in the 1980s, partially because domestic oil production has fallen since then.

Before 1983, energy companies paid the federal government royalties amounting to one-sixth (about 17%) of the value of the oil or gas they actually extracted. With the onset of area-wide leasing, that royalty rate dropped to one-eighth (about 12.5 percent) of the resource value. The idea behind the decrease was to encourage exploration in the Gulf of Mexico’s deeper regions.

During the Clinton administration in 1995, Congress eased the royalty burden even further by passing the Outer Continental Shelf Deep Water Royalty Relief Act. It allowed companies to drill in certain areas without paying any royalties.

While royalties have risen slightly in the 21st century, Freudenburg and Gramling say those percentages need to be even higher to catch up with states such as Alaska and dozens of countries.

Easing the Deficit?



With the nation’s record-setting deficit at $1.55 trillion—and counting—Freudenburg wishes the government would see public land leases as a gap-tightener. Big picture arithmetic shows that such leasing by MMS is second only to the Internal Revenue Service in dollars destined for Uncle Sam.

“It’s a really distant second,” Freudenburg says. But at a time when this country is hurting from a litany of financial woes, “we need to treat this leasing program as a one-time bonus on a resource that we’re fortunate to have.”

“The 300 million-plus Americans are the ones who own this offshore oil source,” he continues. “It’s precious and there isn’t that much left. We could use the money to pay for schools, parklands and other necessities, instead of just saying nobody should make money off of this except for top executives of oil companies.”

California Makes Green Housing Affordable - InsideClimate News,"Tue, 11 May 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlY2xpbWF0ZW5ld3Mub3JnL25ld3MvMTEwNTIwMTAvY2FsaWZvcm5pYS1tYWtlcy1ncmVlbi1ob3VzaW5nLWFmZm9yZGFibGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sunlight is free, but getting power from solar panels remains far from it. At least for some low-income families in California, it’s now affordable for the first time.

The California Public Utilities Commission Single-Family Affordable Solar Homes program, or SASH, is a first-of-its-kind program dedicated to bringing solar energy to owners of low-income housing. The program, part of the California Solar Initiative and managed by the non-profit organization GRID Alternatives, will bring solar power to 7,000 homes by 2016, all of them designated affordable housing.

The incentives offer anywhere from $4.75 to $7.00 per watt depending on income and the size of the installation. In some cases, these incentives completely cover costs.



GRID Alternatives, which started in 2003, with a mission to provide renewable energy and energy-efficiency services, equipment and training to low-income homeowners, says that going solar saves families 75 percent or more on their electricity bills. Because low-income families spend a significant portion of their income on utilities, cutting those costs can have a large impact on the bottom line.

Ted Bardacke, a senior associate in the Green Urbanism Program for Global Green USA, an organization that works to create sustainable cities and buildings, said that energy and water expenses can play a huge role in some families’ expenses.

""To a family of four earning $20,000 a year, saving $100 on energy and water bills a month is a significant proportion of income whereas for a family of for earning $100,000, it matters, but not as much,"" he said. ""There is a strong financial imperative and we get the environmental benefits, as well.""

GRID provides the solar panels and energy-efficiency upgrades for nothing but sweat equity. Homeowners, along with volunteers, are engaged and participate in the installation, learning valuable green job skills along the way. What isn’t paid for through SASH or other rebates and incentives, the organization covers through fundraising and grants.

SASH Effects

The SASH program has helped expand GRID’s solar installations to 300 in 2010—as many as the program had in the previous five years—allowing underserved communities to embrace renewable energy. The GRID systems installed so far will save more than $8 million over the lifetime of the equipment and avoid more than 38,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, GRID has helped train nearly 4,000 volunteers, including many low-income residents, interested in green jobs.

""If we’re going to have broad based adoption of both renewable energy and energy efficiency it behooves us to look at all of our markets,"" said Erica Mackie, a mechanical engineer who left a career working on corporate energy efficiency programs to found GRID Alternatives with a colleague of his, Tim Sears.

""You have to look at affordable housing developers and at low income home owners as a large portion of the population that we want to get on board with renewable energy,"" Mackie added. ""Low income families can benefit from the savings and they’re the ones with the most to gain in terms of breathing the pollution from traditional power plants and paying a higher portion of their take-home pay on energy bills… Using those rooftops promotes renewables as a mainstream technology, which it should be.""

One challenge is identifying eligible home owners.

According to GRID, there are 1.8 million low-income homeowners in California but no central database of these homes. GRID is partnering with the California Housing Partnership Corporation to help identify them. They have also found that homes that are eligible are often in clusters. Once an installation goes in, the neighbors become more interested and want to go solar, too.

Green Affordable Development

Global Green USA is focused primarily on new, multi-family low-income housing developments in California and around the country. In general, targeted communities have been receptive to their focus on renewable energy, efficiency and choosing smart locations near public transportation and services.

""We tend to focus on the aspects of green building that will have a direct benefit to the occupant or owner of the building. What’s interesting is that those span the whole gamut of green building,"" said Bardacke, who is also the author of Global Green USA’s book Blueprint for Greening Affordable Housing. ""From a location perspective, we want those buildings to be located in places that are accessible to public transit and not car-dependent because the need to own a car is a major drain on people’s pocket books,"" he added. ""For many, monthly transportation costs can be as large as or more than rent. We think about the reduction in carbon from public transportation, but it has a big impact on low income residents.""

The building in their Chula Vista, California, development, which has been open for one year, is a net exporter of energy. Beginning next year, about half of the tenants will start getting checks from San Diego Gas and Electric. Another project in San Jose gives all residents free public transportation passes as both an environmental and economic incentive.

According to Bardacke, California is not alone when it comes to low-income green housing.

Georgia, Connecticut and several other states scored higher in terms of low-income housing tax credits and incentives, according to a Global Green Analysis. And in New Orleans, Global Green USA has opened the first low-income green housing developments. Now, most low-income housing projects there are following suit and incorporating sustainability.

Policy Advantages

Where California has an edge is in access to sustainable materials and components, as well as some important pieces of legislation. The Global Warming Solutions Act, or AB 32, for example, mandates reductions in greenhouse gases. With that and other policies, California makes building affordable and environmentally friendly housing more doable than elsewhere, Bardacke said.

""Costs are tight, but when green building is a goal from the beginning… the project teams can almost always figure out how to build it within the allotted budget,"" he said.

In fact, a recent study from Enterprise Community Partners found that a 2 percent upfront cost increase in making low-income housing more energy and water efficient paid for itself. Specifically, making homes Energy Star-compliant or better, iimproving water conservation and using some environmentally safe materials improved ventilation. Choosing sites close to transportation and services also had a net positive economic result.

Economics aside, the housing units studied also resulted in two tons fewer CO2 emissions annually compared to buildings without these efficiency measures.

Bardacke also said that it is important to forget our ideas about low-income housing projects.

""The image of affordable housing being run down and of poor quality is wrong,"" he said. ""It’s misguided and it’s out of date. It’s often better than market housing.""

Top 10 des sociétés du CAC 40 selon leur réputation - Batiactu,"Fri, 28 May 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhdGlhY3R1LmNvbS9lZGl0by90b3AtMTAtc29jaWV0ZXMtY2FjLTQwLXNlbG9uLWxldXItcmVwdXRhdGlvbi0yNjE0Mi5waHDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Les Echos ont publié vendredi les résultats d'une étude du Reputation Institute, basé à New York , qui édite chaque année le classement mondial de la réputation des entreprises. Pour la première fois, un cabinet de consultants français a été associé à l'enquête, i&e Consultants, afin d'établir le classement des 40 sociétés françaises cotées en Bourse.

Si la réputation d'une entreprise se construit à partir des opinions, favorables ou défavorables, émises sur elle, l'étude s'est basée sur les sept facteurs déterminants qui forgent une réputation. Pour les sociétés du CAC 40, les critères étaient : produits et services ; innovation ; emploi ; gouvernance ; citoyenne ; leadership ; performance.

Pour chacun de ces critères ou « driver », un Top 5 a été établi. Seules deux entreprises du secteur de la construction apparaissent dans les 7 classements. Ainsi, Suez Environnement se place à la 3e place dans la catégorie « Citoyenneté », tandis qu' EDF arrive en 4e position pour l' « Emploi ». L'étude indique également que trois entreprises (PeugeotPSA, Saint-Gobain et Schneider Electric ) ne figurent dans aucun des Top 5 par « driver », mais que l'obtention d'une grande homogénéité d'appréciation sur l'ensemble des critères les fait finalement figurer dans le Top 10. A l'inverse, EDF, EADS, Suez Environnement, Sanofi-Aventis, STMicroelectronics et Total obtiennent de belles performances dans les Top 5, mais n'apparaissent pas dans le classement global, pénalisées par une plus grande disparité d'appréciation de leur réputation.

Cac 40

De façon plus générale, l'étude révèle que certains secteurs comme la construction et l'énergie sont davantage reléguées en deuxième moitié de classement, seules Air Liquide (5e), Saint-Gobain (7e) et Schneider Electric (10e) tirent leur épingle du jeu."
