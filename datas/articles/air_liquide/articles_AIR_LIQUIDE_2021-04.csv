Parkinson's disease: crossed views on the management of the pathology - Air Liquide,"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvaGVhbHRoY2FyZS9wYXJraW5zb25zLWRpc2Vhc2UtY3Jvc3NlZC12aWV3cy1tYW5hZ2VtZW50LXBhdGhvbG9nedIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"160,000 people in France suffer from Parkinson’s disease. That’s one in a hundred people over the age of 65. The figures are expected to double by 2050. Parkinson’s is an automaticity disorder characterized by slowness of movement, rigidity, and sometimes tremors when at rest. Professor David Devos, neurologist and pharmacologist at Lille University Hospital, joins a nursing consultant for the home healthcare provider ORKYN’, to discuss the necessary and beneficial collaboration among healthcare professionals to improve the daily lives of patients and their carers.

What is the role of at-home healthcare providers in caring for patients suffering from Parkinson’s disease?

David Devos: A patient consults with a neurologist approximately every three to nine months. The frequency depends on the therapeutic needs of the patient and the advancement of the illness. However, the situation can deteriorate between appointments, and the patient’s quality of life declines with it. That is why we need qualified personnel who can report on our patients’ conditions. At-home healthcare providers relay information to the different professionals caring for the patient in order to best treat the patient and follow up on their condition.

Nursing consultant: Yes, the reporting role is essential: we provide a connection between the patient’s home life and the hospital. We explain, we clarify, we train, and most importantly we accompany patients with regular follow-ups, generally every three months in the absence of complications. We have a special relationship with patients and their families. The course of healthcare can sometimes be complicated in these illnesses, depending on whether the patient lives in the city or countryside. They sometimes feel isolated. We act as a support system and a source of information, bringing them security and improving their quality of life.

What do service providers bring to the course of healthcare?

David Devos: We work as a team, and everyone’s contributions are useful. For us as neurologists, it is convenient to get reports. It reassures us to be able to count on an organization that can alert us within a time limit that we could not otherwise have had with our patients. It is a safety net for our patients, and for us too. An efficient city/hospital network seems essential to me, and it is the future! But from the patient’s point of view, it is the human aspect that is most important. If you ask them, you understand that it’s not just about treatment: it’s about feeling accompanied, monitored and listened to that makes all the difference.

Nursing consultant: We listen to patients and reassure them. We encourage them in their progress, and we explain the treatment to them, but we are especially present with them. Some individuals deal with their illness on their own; others might have carers, but those carers can be overwhelmed. We don’t have all the answers. We remain within our roles as at-home healthcare providers. But we act as bridges, and we know when it is time to get experts involved to make the course of healthcare more effective.

How can the course of healthcare be improved for Parkinson’s disease?

David Devos: In order for a carer to contribute to the course of healthcare, that person must be qualified to evaluate the patient on a regular basis. When a patient consults with us, we only get a snapshot of the individual’s health at that precise moment. However, in pathologies such as Parkinson’s disease, the patient’s condition fluctuates from day to day. The most valuable assessment is one that can be made in real-life conditions. That means at home, by a qualified health care professional. A tool such as an actigraph provides precious data that we use to adapt the treatment, optimize its benefits, and improve the quality of life. An actimetry unit is a medical device which is worn like a watch. It records each movement that the patient makes: a blockage, a tremor, or an unusually slow movement. We might have the patient wear one for several days to get a reliable idea of whether the treatment is sufficient with regard to the motor ability that we observe in consultation.

Nursing consultant: That is a tool that we use, particularly before putting a pump in. It provides reference information with which we can make comparisons a few months later. The device plays an important role in educating the patient and their loved ones. It makes it possible to demonstrate improvements, to point out the benefits of treatment, and to place the illness – not just symptoms – in context. It is a complement to our at-home visit reporting, and it enables us to share very precise information with the doctor."
Air Liquide's Next Generation SMR-X Hydrogen Plant Start-up - Energy Industry Review,"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vZW5lcmd5aW5kdXN0cnlyZXZpZXcuY29tL3Bvd2VyL2Fpci1saXF1aWRlcy1uZXh0LWdlbmVyYXRpb24tc21yLXgtaHlkcm9nZW4tcGxhbnQtc3RhcnQtdXAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As of April 22, Air Liquide’s high-tech SMR-X hydrogen plant — located on the Covestro site in the Antwerp port area — has officially been brought into operation.

What makes the SMR-X so special — compared to a traditional SMR (Steam Methane Reformer) — is that it does not produce excess steam. The result is better energy efficiency and lower CO2 emissions. Covestro will also uses some of this CO2 as a raw material in ammonium carbonate production.

Cleaner hydrogen

Covestro also purchases around 40% of the hydrogen produced. The remaining 60% goes to other customers via the Air Liquide pipeline network.

Using the SMR-X plant, Air Liquide can leave a smaller carbon footprint when supplying hydrogen to its customers. The plant will produce around 56,000 m3 of hydrogen per hour, greatly increasing hydrogen availability in the Antwerp area.

Overcoming challenges

Plant construction has become more challenging than anticipated due to the unforeseen restrictions surrounding Covid-19. This has naturally led to delays but, thanks to the team’s flexibility and efforts, the delays have been very limited.

Initially, specialist Air Liquide personnel from Germany, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Kazakhstan, and Italy were due to arrive to help start up the plant. But because of Covid-19 travel restrictions, this wasn’t feasible in the end. Thanks are due to the flexibility and commitment of Air Liquide’s Engineering and Construction team, as well as Covestro and the contractors involved, for the plant’s construction and successful start-up with no major delays. At the end of 2020, the first industrial production (FIP) milestone was reached.

The SMR-X factory will mean that Air Liquide contributes to the energy transition and the development of transport applications for hydrogen in the Benelux. The project therefore represents a perfect fit for the Air Liquide Group’s sustainability objectives.

And best of all: the completed SMR-X unit’s early test results demonstrate that the plant is performing even better than anticipated.

Sasol launches largest ever renewable energy tender - News for the Energy Sector - Energy Voice,"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVuZXJneXZvaWNlLmNvbS9vaWxhbmRnYXMvYWZyaWNhL3BldHJvY2hlbWljYWxzLWFmcmljYS8zMTQ0OTQvc2Fzb2wtcmVuZXdhYmxlLWFpci1saXF1aWRlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sasol is seeking suppliers to provide it with renewable energy at its South African operations.

The first tranche of the project will favour wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) options. The deadline to submit expressions of interest is April 23.

Sasol has launched the procurement programme with Air Liquide, which agreed to buy air separation units (ASUs) at the Secunda site.

“Due to the highly integrated nature of the Secunda site and the footprint associated with the ASUs, collaboration between the companies is necessary to ensure optimal GHG reduction benefits,” said Sasol’s chief procurement officer for its energy business Lebelo Lukhele.

“It is anticipated that a collaborative approach will not only result in the original Sasol commitment for the Secunda site being met, but will also be exceeded through the combined efforts.”

Sasol and Air Liquide will jointly procure 900 MW of renewable energy by 2030, up from the previous target of 600 MW. Sasol will take 500 MW while Air Liquide will take 400 MW.

This generation should begin commercial operations as of 2023.

The company said this would be the largest renewable energy procurement deal in the private sector in South Africa. Sasol’s largest operations are Secunda, in Mpumalanga, and Sasolburg, in Free State.

The company is aiming to reduce emissions by 10% by 2030, from a 2017 baseline.

Individual projects should have at least 70 MW of capacity. Bidders will supply electricity as independent power producers (IPPs) and strike power purchase agreements (PPAs).

Bidders can access the request for proposals by submitting company profiles with contact details to renewable.energy@sasol.com and za-renewable@airliquide.com.

Greener and cleaner

Sasol also said it was looking at other decarbonisation efforts. The company said there was a focus on green hydrogen, more natural gas and improving energy efficiency.

Sasol’s CFO Paul Victor said the company was working to become “greener and cleaner”, in comments to Energy Voice in February. The company is working to cut coal use at Secunda and the shift is likely to focus on gas and renewables, he said.

Investor pressure group Just Share criticised Sasol in late March. The company had not aligned its emission reduction targets with Paris Agreement goals, the group said. The company emitted 63.9 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2017, roughly the same as Israel.

Sasol took issue with the complaints. Just Share’s was “inflexible” in its assessment criteria, it said. They fail to “recognise valid and real commitment, context and intent by some corporates, including Sasol, to transition”.

The company will reveal more details at its capital markets day, it said. Sasol “will be able to achieve higher scores on the relevant indicators once our climate change approach is announced later this year”."

Rusatom Overseas, a Rosatom subsidiary, Air Liquide, a leading industrial gas producer, and the Government of the Sakhalin region have signed a Memorandum of Understanding stipulating the cooperation for a feasibility study that will explore the possibility of the development of low carbon hydrogen production in the Sakhalin region.

The MOU is a first step in fostering the development of a hydrogen economy targeting applications in both the domestic and overseas markets. This will contribute to development of the low carbon industry in the Sakhalin region.

Marilene Turcotte, General Director of Air Liquide in Russia, said:

🔥 What about we co-host a webinar? Let's educate, captivate, and convert the hydrogen economy!



Hydrogen Central is the global go-to online magazine for the hydrogen economy, we can help you host impactful webinars that become a global reference on your topic and are an evergreen source of leads. Click here to request more details

We are delighted to explore this energy transition opportunity in cooperation with Rusatom Overseas and the Sakhalin region.

“This cooperation for decarbonised growth contributes to the objectives of the Sakhalin region to reach carbon neutrality by 2025. This is a first step and we are ready to contribute to an efficient and sustainable industry through Air Liquide’s unique technological know-how and innovative solutions to support the energy transition ambition of the Russian Federation”.

READ the latest news shaping the hydrogen market at Hydrogen Central

Evgeny Pakermanov, President of JSC Rusatom Overseas:

In the future, the creation of a complex for the production of low-carbon hydrogen on the island of Sakhalin opens up opportunities for its export to the countries of the Asia-Pacific region.

“We plan to receive the results of the technical and economic assessment of the project and the primary design documentation by the end of 2021, after which we will be able to make the most efficient decision on the volume of hydrogen production. It is expected that the production rate can range from 30 to 100 thousand tons per year”

Governor of the Sakhalin Region Valery Limarenko:

The Sakhalin Region is a unique sub-federal unit of Russia. It is located completely on islands, has rich resource potential and successfully neighbors with the countries of the Asia-Pacific region.

“All this creates special conditions for business development and gives advantages for the implementation of a number of investment projects. Today, the Sakhalin Region is becoming a platform for an experiment to achieve carbon neutrality. We plan to launch new investment projects, which, among other things, will contribute to solving this problem. We will be glad to welcome Rosatom and Air Liquide as potential investors if they decide to implement this project on the island. The Government of the Sakhalin Region is doing a lot to improve the business climate in the region. We have minimized administrative barriers: we have reduced the time for issuing building permits, registering enterprises, registering real estate objects. The signed memorandum confirms our readiness for close and mutually beneficial cooperation”

This comes on the back of Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia's press conference wherein he accused a Haryana government official of stopping oxygen supply to Delhi from a plant in Faridabad. The Delhi government said, ""If the oxygen quota gets depleted in these hospitals, Delhi is staring at a catastrophe waiting to unfold.""

The statement further noted, ""It is unfortunate that states like Haryana and Uttar Pradesh are curtailing supply of life-saving oxygen to Delhi. Just as the Haryana government, the Uttar Pradesh government has illegally captured the oxygen production plants, depriving Delhi of oxygen.""

Various Delhi hospitals have also said that due to the non-cooperation of the Haryana government, they have limited stock of oxygen left as the lives of many COVID-19 patients continue to be at risk.

Sasol and Air Liquide to launch the Renewable Energy procurement programme for its South African Operations - Cape Business News,"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYm4uY28uemEvZmVhdHVyZWQvc2Fzb2wtYW5kLWFpci1saXF1aWRlLXRvLWxhdW5jaC10aGUtcmVuZXdhYmxlLWVuZXJneS1wcm9jdXJlbWVudC1wcm9ncmFtbWUtZm9yLWl0cy1zb3V0aC1hZnJpY2FuLW9wZXJhdGlvbnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sasol and Air Liquide are inviting bidders to participate in a Request for Proposal (RFP) process for the supply of renewable energy to Sasol’s South African operations.

An international integrated chemicals and energy company, Sasol’s core business is leveraging technologies and the expertise of its people to build and operate world-scale facilities to produce a range of high-value product streams, including liquid fuels, chemicals and low-carbon electricity. The company’s largest operations are in South Africa specifically Secunda in Mpumalanga and Sasolburg in the Free State.

As communicated to the market, Sasol has set a greenhouse gas (GHG) target for our South African operations to reduce emissions by at least 10%, off a 2017 baseline, by 2030. The introduction of renewable energy will be a significant contributor to our decarbonisation efforts.

Subsequent to setting the 2030 target, Sasol entered into an agreement with Air Liquide for the sale of the Air Separation Units (ASUs) at the Secunda site. Air Liquide also committed to GHG emission reduction interventions over and above those committed by Sasol.

“Due to the highly integrated nature of the Secunda site and the footprint associated with the ASUs, collaboration between the companies is necessary to ensure optimal GHG reduction benefits,” said Lebelo Lukhele, Chief Procurement Officer: Energy Business.

“It is anticipated that a collaborative approach will not only result in the original Sasol commitment for the Secunda site being met, but will also be exceeded through the combined efforts.”

As a result of the sale and the collaborative decarbonisation approach, both companies will now jointly procure 900MW of renewable energy by 2030, with an end state allocation of 500MW to Sasol and 400MW to Air Liquide, significantly increased from Sasol’s originally intended 600MW. This transaction will represent the largest renewable energy procurement deal from the private sector in South Africa and is testimony to the opportunities that emanate from partnering.

“We are targeting the procurement of the first 600MW of capacity this year [around 1800 GWh per year] of which 400MW will be allocated to Air Liquide and 200MW to Sasol, with the envisaged commercial operation dates commencing in 2023,” added Lukhele.

It is envisaged that the successful bidder(s) will supply energy as Independent Power Producer(s), in terms of Power Purchase Agreement(s) to be agreed between the parties.

In aligning with the Integrated Resource Plan (IRP 2019), Wind and Solar Photovoltaic (PV) technologies are favoured for the first tranche of the programme. The individual projects must demonstrate a generation capacity of at least 70MW [~200 GWh per year].

Interested bidders may apply for access to the RFP by sending their company profiles with contact details to both: renewable.energy@sasol.com and za-renewable@airliquide.com.

The closing date for submissions of expressions of interest is 23 April 2021.

Sasol is committed to further reduction opportunities to accelerate our decarbonisation efforts, aligned with our 2030 roadmap and with a focus on green hydrogen, the introduction of natural gas and energy efficiency improvement."

The security officials said 13 trucks, of different capacities, have left from the refinery to supply oxygen to hospitals in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab since Thursday morning.

Following a surge in demand, IOC has also increased its production and now it is supplying 140 MT oxygen to Delhi, 80 MT to Haryana, and 20 MT to Punjab.

Inspector Manjeet Singh, who is monitoring the truck movement, says, “We are examining the documents of every truck leaving with liquid oxygen and the oxygen is being supplied as per government orders.”

However, some truck drivers from Delhi alleged discrimination in allocation of oxygen.

Hira Lal, of Vaibhav Oxygen that supplies oxygen to many hospitals in Delhi, said that he had come on Wednesday but is yet to get the oxygen.

Another driver, Karan Singh, says his truck was called inside after a wait of 28 hours.

Mahender Singh, who is taking oxygen to Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, said that this is his second turn in the past 24 hours and he has been allowed to take 5.5 tonne oxygen on Thursday.

Earlier, the joint director of Apollo Hospital, Dr Sangita Reddy, in a tweet had sought urgent help from PM Modi, Union defence minister Rajnath Singh, Union commerce and industries minister Piyush Goyal, saying that an oxygen tanker is waiting outside the gate of Air Liquide Panipat at IOC and the driver of the truck is not being allowed to get in.

“Haryana police are stopping the truck and not letting oxygen out of Haryana. Need urgent intervention!” Dr Reddy had tweeted.

But a few minutes later, she tweeted, “Update: The driver has been allowed inside and hopefully oxygen will be sent out soon.”

“Further to my earlier tweet an appeal once again to the govt to please tag oxygen tank as ambulances and enable quick green corridor movement,” she tweeted.

However, officials of Air Liquide Panipat said that they are supplying oxygen as per government schedule and do not have any role in deciding where the oxygen supplies should go first.

Earlier, officials the IOC, had said that they will be supplying 150 MT liquid oxygen (10 MT everyday) to Delhi, Haryana and Punjab free of cost.

But now, officials, requesting anonymity, said that if required, production and supply will be increased.

‘NO CLUE ABOUT MISSING OXYGEN TRUCK’

A tanker carrying liquid oxygen was allegedly stolen by unidentified persons.

As per FIR registered on complaint of district drug controller Vijay Raje against unknown accused, a truck had left Air Liquide, Panipat, to supply oxygen at Sirsa on Wednesday, but it did not reach till evening.

It was allegedly stolen by an unidentified accused on the way, police said.

Matlauda police station in-charge Manjeet Singh said, “A case has been registered under Section 379 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against unknown persons and investigation is on.”

He said that security at Air Liquide has been increased and documents of all trucks are being examined before they leave.

This is the second such incident reported in state in the past two days. On Wednesday, Anil Vij had accused the Delhi government of looting oxygen truck on its way to supply oxygen in Faridabad."
"Day after halting supply, cops now stationed at Panipat oxygen plant to ensure no disruptions - ThePrint","Fri, 23 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcHJpbnQuaW4vaW5kaWEvZGF5LWFmdGVyLWhhbHRpbmctc3VwcGx5LWNvcHMtbm93LXN0YXRpb25lZC1hdC1wYW5pcGF0LW94eWdlbi1wbGFudC10by1lbnN1cmUtbm8tZGlzcnVwdGlvbnMvNjQ0NDgwL9IBggFodHRwczovL3RoZXByaW50LmluL2luZGlhL2RheS1hZnRlci1oYWx0aW5nLXN1cHBseS1jb3BzLW5vdy1zdGF0aW9uZWQtYXQtcGFuaXBhdC1veHlnZW4tcGxhbnQtdG8tZW5zdXJlLW5vLWRpc3J1cHRpb25zLzY0NDQ4MC8_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Update: The driver has just been allowed inside & hopefully the oxygen will be sent out soon.

Panipat/Chandigarh: Hours after Joint Managing Director, Apollo Hospitals, Dr.Sangeeta Reddy tweeted about oxygen supply being stopped by the Haryana government, an air of calm settled over the compound of Air Liquide, where the commotion had taken place earlier.

The Ministry of Home Affairs had passed an order Thursday afternoon prohibiting any state from interfering with the supply of oxygen, or imposing restrictions on the transport of oxygen.

Since then police have been stationed outside Air Liquide to ensure the MHA order is followed and that there are no disruptions to oxygen supplies. The manufacturing firm is located in the Panipat Indian Oil Corporation Limited refinery.

“We have been stationed here since yesterday to see that the oxygen is supplied with no problems. There’s no telling how long we will be stationed here, though,” said Romi Gill, a police officer at the site.

Just a day earlier, however, the police were doing the bidding of the state government. Home and Health Minister Anil Vij had claimed Delhi “looted” oxygen supply that was on its way to Faridabad.

“On Wednesday the police stopped our truck and said we could not go to Delhi. This was after we waited hours to get our tank filled. We had to wait four to five hours before being let go,” said Kuldeep Yadav, a truck driver supplying Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital in Delhi with oxygen. “We were getting calls from the hospital and the company, but we were helpless. We were finally let go by 8 pm.”

At a press conference Thursday, Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar didn’t deny holding the supply hostage but said the problem had been “resolved.”

“I have even held a detailed discussion with the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi on this issue,” he said, adding, “From now on, one truck will be loaded for Haryana and one truck each for Delhi and Punjab. This entire process at Panipat plant is being closely monitored by me.”

A spokesperson for Apollo Hospital told ThePrint, “It was really touch and go for us for a while, but we managed to get the oxygen supply on time. We are expecting the supply to be smoother now on, since the order has been passed.”

Supply to Delhi

The Panipat refinery has the capacity to produce 260 metric tons (MT) of oxygen, of which 140 MT is supplied to Delhi, 80 MT is supplied to Haryana and about 20 MT is for Punjab. Khattar said a roster had been drawn up for the filling and loading of oxygen cylinders in the trucks from the refinery.

Hospitals in the national capital which saw 26,169 new cases Thursday, have been left gasping for oxygen following shortages.

Though the MHA order was passed in the afternoon, hospitals continued to send out SOS messages on social media as they scrambled for supplies.

SOS -Batra Hospital. A senior doctor said, "" I am running pillar to post…I am writing to everybody bcoz we have only 2 hrs of O2 supply. We can't ask patients to go back. We have 1,000 kg of central oxygen supply and need 7,000 kg for 352 Covid patients here.""@IndianExpress — Jignasa Sinha (@jignasa_sinha) April 22, 2021

Dr.Kamal K.Parwal of the Aakash Super Speciality Hospital, Sector 3 Dwarka in New Delhi wrote to the Union Health Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan at 4 pm Thursday, saying their oxygen supply trucks had been stopped by the Faridabad police on the instructions of the Haryana government.

Dr.Rahul, Director Fortis, Gurugram, tweeted that oxygen supply to the hospital had been affected because there was a disruption at Bhiwadi in Rajasthan. He said the oxygen would last only one hour and a 100 patients were on oxygen support. This, even though Vij had said he would “talk” to the Chief Minister of Rajasthan.

1 hour oxygen left in fortis gurugram. Tanker from bhiwadi not allowed to come to Haryana.

Saket Tiku, President of the All India Industrial Gases Manufacturers Association told ThePrint, “Right now the situation is such that states feel they have the right over what is being produced in their states,” adding, “There are clear cut instructions which should be followed now. If they aren’t followed, then the system fails.”

The Larsen and Lam Climate Initiative injects $35 million for the purchase of cutting-edge plant to be located in California

OMNI Conversion Technologies Inc. (OMNI CT) announced the first sale of its unprecedented waste to hydrogen product. The Larsen and Lam Climate Initiative, a foundation backed by philanthropists Chris Larsen and Lyna Lam, has committed $35 million to bring this ground-breaking technology to production in the fight against climate change. The first commercial plant in production from OMNI CT will use unsorted non-recyclable Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), which is currently disposed of in landfills, to produce negative carbon hydrogen in California.

New technologies are essential in the fight against climate change. While low-cost solar electricity was a dream only a decade ago, its impact today is far-reaching. The Larsen and Lam Climate Initiative investment will accelerate the global adoption of OMNI CT technology.

Chris Larsen, Co-Founder of the Larsen and Lam Climate Initiative and Ripple:

Professor Daniel Kammen, Chair of the Energy and Resources Group at the University of California, Berkeley, commented that zero-carbon fuels are a critical part of the aggressive path to a clean economy. As California looks to build a vibrant zero-carbon economy, the Omni technology is an exciting addition that will solve multiple problems at once.

The Omni 200™GPRS™ waste to hydrogen product can produce around 5000 tonnes of negative carbon hydrogen each year, from 200 tonnes a day of unsorted non-recyclable garbage. Hydrogen is produced in the city where it is needed and the garbage is diverted from landfill to OMNI CT and eliminated with no air emissions and nothing left for disposal. Energy in the garbage replaces electricity otherwise required to make green hydrogen. The circular hydrogen produced could operate some 550 city buses running on hydrogen at a cost less than the current cost of using gasoline or diesel.

The purchase was funded and signed on April 21, 2021 with the goal of being in production in California converting Municipal Solid Waste to hydrogen by the end of 2023.

Demand to start another oxygen plant at VSP grows - Bizz Buzz,"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpenpidXp6Lm5ld3MvaW5kdXN0cnkvZGVtYW5kLXRvLXN0YXJ0LWFub3RoZXItb3h5Z2VuLXBsYW50LWF0LXZzcC1ncm93cy04ODEwMzLSAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5iaXp6YnV6ei5uZXdzL2FtcC9pbmR1c3RyeS9kZW1hbmQtdG8tc3RhcnQtYW5vdGhlci1veHlnZW4tcGxhbnQtYXQtdnNwLWdyb3dzLTg4MTAzMg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Visakhapatnam THE demand for commissioning a 850 tonne oxygen plant at Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) is growing as shortage of oxygen pan India is claiming lives of several critically ill Covid patients.



TDP MLA PGVR Naidu (Gana Babu) said the plant can be commissioned by investing just Rs 90 crore. VSP has the required manpower. It is already supplying medical oxygen through tankers to AP, Telangana and other parts of the country from the existing facility - new wire rod mill.

The MLA said Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited, the corporate entity of VSP had done commendable job by sending oxygen in Oxygen Express to Maharashtra and requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to intervene and sort out the issue.

The plant was installed at VSP at a cost of Rs 2,000 crore by a French company Air Liquide. It has been eight years to date and has not been commissioned (reason - final payment of Rs 90 crore is due), regretted Vizag Development Forum vice-president O Naresh Kumar.

He said ""if we clear this, immediately Rs 2,000-crore asset now worth much more, can give us full capacity of 1700 tonne per day and greatly enhance our productivity.""

When contacted, an RINL official said the case is under arbitration.

As per the MoU, Air Liquide will invest, build and operate two Air Separation Units (ASU) with a total installed oxygen capacity over 1,800 tonne per day, scheduled to start by the end of 2012. In addition, Air Liquide was also supposed to produce large quantities of liquid gases (oxygen, nitrogen and argon) to meet the needs of the industrial and medical customers in the region.

The Air Liquide investment amounted to around €70 million for the production facilities and the supply chain together, Naresh Kumar said.

At present, the Air Separation Plant (ASP) of RINL has total five units of oxygen extraction plants for 7.3 million tonne per annum steel plant.

Every day on an average, ASP produces 2,600 tonne of oxygen gas and 100 tonne of liquid oxygen. The liquid oxygen of 100 tonne is being given out for medical purpose.

RINL is meeting the demand of O2 requirements substantially to AP and other States for the alleviation of human sufferings. Last FY20-21 it had supplied 8,842 tonne of O2 as per requirement."
