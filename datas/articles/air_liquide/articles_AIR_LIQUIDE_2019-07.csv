To support the new agreement and additional volumes, Air Liquide plans to invest nearly 140 million USD to build a new world-scale Air Separation Unit in Bay City, Texas, and related infrastructure investments.

Air Liquide will supply 2,000 tons per day of oxygen and 900 tons per day of nitrogen to GCGV’s planned 1.8 million tons per year ethane cracker facility. Air Liquide will also add nearly eight miles of pipeline to connect GCGV to its Gulf Coast Pipeline System, strengthening Air Liquide’s extensive capabilities throughout the Gulf Coast region of the U.S., and its position in the growing industrial basin of Corpus Christi, where it has been present since the mid-1930’s.

In addition to delivering full requirements for oxygen and nitrogen to GCGV’s new petrochemical plant, the production capacity from the Bay City ASU, and its connection to Air Liquide’s expansive pipeline network along the Gulf Coast, will enable Air Liquide to retire older, less efficient assets. By modernizing its asset fleet, Air Liquide provides enhanced competitiveness to its customers over the long term and reduces the carbon intensity of its operations, hence contributing to achieving its 2025 Climate Objectives.

With Air Liquide’s ability to provide large volumes of oxygen and nitrogen via its integrated production and supply network, customers can benefit from a safe, flexible and reliable supply to meet their growing demands.

"Craft beers: barley, water, hops and gas! - Air Liquide","Thu, 11 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvaW5kdXN0cnkvY3JhZnQtYmVlcnMtYmFybGV5LXdhdGVyLWhvcHMtYW5kLWdhc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As the first and only gas company to offer an in-house craft beer expertise, Air Liquide, through its U.S. subsidiary Airgas, supports the bubbling American craft beer market. We met with Dan Peterson, Brewmaster & Director of Operations at Ferment Brewing Company.

Riding the wave According to the Brewers’ Association, there were an estimated 7,346 craft breweries in the U.S. at the end of 2018, including more than 4,500 microbreweries and more than 2,500 brewpubs. It was on this seemingly unstoppable wave that Dan Peterson hatched his idea to open a craft brewery in August 2018 in the small town of Hood River located 60 miles east of Portland, Oregon.

The production of beers requires barley, water and gases! And for his gas supply, Dan built an engaging relationship with Joe Keller, Craft Applications Specialist – Airgas National Carbonation.







After their first meeting a year and a half ago, Joe helped him immediately with the planning of his gas supply needs.







“You just know you’re talking to a beer specialist as much as a gas specialist. We talk about the latest craft beer conferences and I like to discuss the new beers I’m planning and listen to his advice,” Dan says.

Reliable and personalized gas supplies Airgas provides Dan with carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), the imperative brewing gas which, in addition to carbonation (see diagram below), he uses to purge kegs and bottles before filling, push the beer from fermenter to keg, and propel the beer from keg to glass when it is served in the brewery’s tasting room. Ferment’s outdoor 1,000-lb CO 2 tank is refilled every two or three weeks with liquid gas at - 50°F (- 45°C). Dan explains: “we use that 120 psi CO 2 (unit of pressure or of stress) for production and serving from our draft cooler”. In addition to CO 2 , Dan buys oxygen, which he uses to develop yeasts, and nitrogen, specifically to create the recognizable “cascading” effect when serving his dry stout – think of a famous black Irish beverage, and you’ll get the picture. With production currently standing at 800 to 1,000 barrels (or 31 gallons / 140 litres) per year, Ferment is looking confidently to the future. “We are aiming to ramp up steadily and get out into other markets,” says Dan. “We just took delivery of two 40 barrel fermenters which ought to help us double our production by the end of 2019.” With no signs of the craft beer market slowing down, there’s nothing to stop a beer fan like Dan from stepping on the gas.

Airgas, a beer expert

With a long experience in the brewing industry and in beer dispensing, Air Liquide helps craft brewers maximize productivity and reduce downtime with more effective gas and equipment supply chain management, simplified gas system maintenance, and expert safety solutions all backed with uncompromising customer support. Airgas, Air Liquide’s subsidiary in the US, offers comprehensive solutions tailored to brewers’ needs with the help of its technical experts who notably provide gas consulting services and gas consumption monitoring. Serving customers through more than 1,400 locations, Airgas takes care of brewers’ products throughout the beer value chain and assists them in managing their facilities.

Dan Peterson, a beer professional thriving on flavor diversity

Dan’s early career in Vermont as a microbiologist researching innovative breast cancer treatment strategies gave him the molecular knowledge which proved useful when he later went to work for a popular craft brewery in Brooklyn, New York. Several years on and 2,800 miles further west, his attachment to the original roots of beers has lived on.

""I think we pay respect to brewing traditions by using base malts from Belgium, Germany, England or the Czech Republic for example,” says the brewmaster. “But within reason, we also try to showcase ingredients from the nearby Columbia River Gorge - so our London porter contains hops sourced in the region but also has Douglas Fir tips from the Hood River Valley, while our French bière de garde and saison have yeast that I isolated from the forest outside of town.”

Variety and choice appear to be behind the growth in the craft beer market that developed in the 1980s after American brewers traveled to other, mainly European beer producing countries, opening up new perspectives. “Then the customer base got interested in new beer profiles and craft breweries became cool places to hang out. There’s a real camaraderie with the dozen members of our local brewers’ guild, because we’re colleagues rather than competitors selling a commodity.” This specialty market is a land of opportunity for existing and emerging craft brewers – and for the gas experts with the know-how to accompany them on their journey.

Focus on the carbonation process

Carbonation is quite simply the addition of carbon dioxide to a liquid to make it fizz. Beer already contains a small amount of gas due to natural fermentation occurring during the brewing process, but the majority of brewers still carbonate their beer with CO 2 . “This helps to create the head (the foam on the top of the beer in a glass), nose (liberating the aromas of hops and malt) and mouthfeel,” explains Joe Keller, Craft Applications Specialist at Airgas National Carbonation. Carbonation is no simple task and requires patient and careful testing. “Carbonation brings the beer to life,” says Dan Peterson at Ferment. “I’m always trying new quantities of CO 2 in my new recipes to get the right aromatics so that the beer can express its full character.”

CO2-cured Solidia Concrete™ CO2-cured Solidia Concrete™

Solidia Technologies® Chief Scientist Vahit Atakan, Ph.D presented technologies that lower carbon emissions and carbonate concrete during the first annual International Low-Carbon Cement and Concrete Technologies (ILCCC). Leaders in cement technologies from around the world gathered at the University of London to exchange the latest global scientific and technical achievements on low-carbon cement and concrete technologies in order to promote their wide industrial application.

Presenting Properties of Solidia Cement and Concrete, Dr. Atakan described Solidia Cement™ as a low-calcium silicate Cement (CSC) and offered details of the companion processes that enable the manufacture of a low-carbon, non-hydrating binder that reacts with carbon dioxide (COâ‚‚) as well as the concrete curing technology that enables the carbonation of concrete. He shared the results of tests at cement and concrete production facilities in the U.S. and Europe, enabled through a partnership with LafargeHolcim, and the current commercialization process for Solidia Cement and Solidia Concrete™, which are currently sold in the U.S.

“I’m so proud to have been a part of ILCCC, sitting side by side with other leaders who know how important this issue is,” said Dr. Atakan, a co-inventor of Solidia’s technologies. “Solidia's technologies are some of the few capable of having a lasting, meaningful and immediate impact on carbon pollution. As a global industry, we need to put these possibilities into practice.”

At 5-7% of global emissions, the manufacture of cement is the world’s second largest emitter of CO 2 . Solidia lowers the emissions in the production of Solidia Cement and consumes CO 2 in the curing of Solidia Concrete. At scale each year, Solidia’s technologies will be able to reduce the carbon footprint up to 70% (equaling 1.5 gigatons or ~4% of the world’s CO 2 emissions) compared to Portland Cement-based concrete.

Dr. Atakan joined keynote speakers Fredrik Glasser of University of Aberdeen, Karen Scrivener of EPFL, Changwen Miao of Southeast University, Johann Plank of Technische Universität München, Barbara Lothenbach of EMPA, Caijun Shi of Hunan University, Mark Tyrer of Coventry University, Muhammed Basheer of University of Leeds, Thomas Matschei of University of Applied Sciences Dresden (HTW Dresden), Tongbo Sui of Sinoma International Engineering, and Mohsen Ben Haha of HeidelbergCement.

The primary themes of the conference included: ""‹

Manufacturing Portland cement in low-carbon and an energy saving way;

Low-carbon cement and concrete technology based on non-Portland cement systems (e.g., alkali-activated cement and concrete, calcium sulfoaluminate, and MgO-based systems, etc.);

Liquid-air storage offers cheapest route to 24-hour wind and solar - Recharge,"Wed, 10 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlY2hhcmdlbmV3cy5jb20vdHJhbnNpdGlvbi9saXF1aWQtYWlyLXN0b3JhZ2Utb2ZmZXJzLWNoZWFwZXN0LXJvdXRlLXRvLTI0LWhvdXItd2luZC1hbmQtc29sYXIvMi0xLTYzNTY2NtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"To wean the world off fossil fuels, we need to ensure that variable renewable energy can be stored and used to meet electricity demand at any given moment.

The most established methods of energy storage — pumped hydro and batteries both have their drawbacks. The former requires reservoirs and mountains, while batteries can only store small amounts of power and are expensive to use at scale.

But a breakthrough low-cost, build-anywhere solution may have been found, thanks to a privately-funded UK-based company that has been quietly developing its unique technology for the past 14 years.

Highview Power’s liquid-air energy storage (LAES) technology — which has been proven in the field at a 5MW/15MWh grid-connected pilot project near Manchester — is able to store huge amounts of power for months at a time in any location, and at a far cheaper price than any other energy-storage system.

“For a 100MW system, we are already touching [a levelized cost of storage (LCOS) of] $100 per MWh today,” chief executive Javier Cavada tells Recharge. “In ten years from now, I can see that being $50/MWh. That's very doable.”

By comparison, a new pumped-hydro plant would have an LCOS of $152-198 per MWh, with a comparable lithium-ion system costing $285-581/MWh, according to analyst Lazard.

Article continues below the advert

With a new gas-peaker plant having a levelized cost of energy of $156-210/MWh, and wind power at $30-60/MWh (according to Lazard), it may already cheaper to balance the grid using wind-powered liquid-air storage than fossil-fuel technology. And if the LAES system is “charged” using wind power that would otherwise be curtailed, the wholesale price of that power would be close to zero.

And renewables backed up by LAES could soon be cheaper than new dispatchable coal-fired power plants, which currently cost $60-140/MWh (according to Lazard).

Highview’s technology, which it calls ""cryogenic energy storage"" or CRYObattery, is highly modular, meaning that a project's power (MW) and storage capacity (MWh) can easily be scaled up by simply adding larger turbines or more storage tanks — with no technical or economic limit on either.

“The turbine is one of the most expensive components of the system. But if you change a 50MW turbine for a 100MW turbine, you don’t get double the cost,” Cavada explains. “A turbine of 200MW is double the cost of a 50MW turbine, but it’s four times the capacity.”

We will be the biggest energy-storage company on the planet, that’s for sure

He points out that a 50MW system today would have an LCOS of $140/MWh, whereas a 100MW plant would be close to $100/MWh. “The larger the system, the lower the cost,” Cavada says. “It’s totally exponential.”

Multiple LAES plants are already in the pipeline, with the first projects of around 50MW/250MWh due to be completed in the UK next year — developed by Highview in a joint venture with solar EPC company TSK.

“In 2022, we will be building 20 [liquid-air storage] plants of 100MW each,” says Cavada. “We will be the biggest energy-storage company on the planet, that’s for sure.”

How it works and what it can do

Highview’s technology is surprisingly straightforward. Air is cooled down to -196°C, shrinking its volume by a factor of 700, and stored in low-pressure vacuum-insulated steel tanks — the kind that houses liquefied natural gas (LNG). When this cryogenically frozen air is exposed to ambient temperatures, it turns back into a gas and rapidly expands, with the rush of air from this 700-fold expansion directly driving an electricity-generating turbine.

The round-trip efficiency of the system — ie, the amount of energy that goes in, compared to the amount that comes out — is 60%, although this can be increased to 100% by using waste heat or waste cold from neighbouring facilities, says Cavada.

“[When you get heat from] industrial processes — a [nearby] steel foundry or a power plant — you can actually go to 70% [round-trip efficiency]. And if you get a lot of heat you can get to about 75%,” explains Cavada. “But if you get cold on top of that, for instance from an LNG [liquefied natural gas] terminal — you are wasting cold everywhere there — you can go to 90 or 100, and more than 100 because it's not really round-trip because you are getting the cold and heat from somewhere [else].”

The insulation of the commoditised steel tanks is so good that only about 0.1% of the stored liquid air is lost each day, although the exact amount depends on the shape and surface area of the tank. This cold “boil off” is not wasted, as it is fed back into the system’s high-grade cold store.

In fact, all the “super-reliable and low-cost” equipment used in the Highview system is off-the-shelf and has been used in other industries for decades, giving Cavada confidence that the company’s plants will be able to operate for more than 30 years.

The first of these, in the UK, “are all at existing power plants that are going to be decommissioned — coal plants and thermal plants that are going to be [shut down] in the coming two or three years”, says Cavada.

“We are coming in with storage capabilities able to give all the services of thermal plants [including reactive power and voltage control], but the input of power into the storage will come hopefully from more and more wind. We get the power from the grid and we expect that the grid will enable more renewables.”

One of the main business models supporting the LAES plants is known as “arbitrage” — charging the system using cheap electricity (generally when the supply of wind and solar is greater than electricity demand) and selling it back to the grid when wholesale market prices are high (ie, when demand is higher than supply).

“That’s one of the revenues, arbitrage, [but] more than 50% of the revenues are totally contracted. So in a way we are replacing decommissioned thermal power generation with energy storage.”

While the initial string of LAES plants will be used to balance the grid, they could also be built at wind or solar farms to make those renewables projects dispatchable, or near-dispatchable.

This would be most efficient for island projects, or perhaps those in places with little grid interconnection.

“We are looking at projects on islands, I cannot say the names, where you can connect directly to wind and solar [farms],"" says Cavada. ""Then you can really make a wind or solar farm dispatchable. So instead of eight hours of sun, you’re having 14 [or more] hours of sun.

“So we can eliminate curtailment of wind obviously, and we are enabling solar to work 24/7.”

Highview’s competition

Cavada says Highview’s competition is the fossil-fuel industry — gas-peaker plants — rather than comparable up-and-coming medium-term storage technologies, such as Siemens Gamesa’s hot-rock thermal system.

“We don't see ourselves competing with other energy storage [technologies] because today we are so much ahead,” says Cavada. “We are proven. We are ready with a very, very good efficiency, with super-good scaleability.”

He adds that Siemens Gamesa’s technology is still at the “experimental” stage (it is now being tested at a commercial pilot project in Hamburg) and has much lower efficiencies.

Siemens Gamesa chief technology officer Antonio de la Torre recently told Recharge that his company’s ETES (electric thermal energy storage) system currently has a round-trip efficiency of 45-50%, with an aim to reach 70% within 15-20 years.

“We are much cheaper, and we are going to stay much cheaper,” says Cavada.

“But I tell you that we are only scratching the surface in all the energy storage that needs to be deployed. Let's push for all the energy-storage technologies because we need all of them to be in the market because there’s so much power to be replaced with renewables. [Highview is] not going to be able to win all the projects needed because we won't have capacity to [build them all].”"

However, Air Liquide will remain on board as an investor in Hydrogenics.

Cummins announced that the company will acquire all shares of the Canadian fuel cell and hydrogen technology developer and manufacturer, with the exception of the shares Air Liquide acquired in Hydrogenics earlier this year. Cummins will pay $15 per share, equivalent to $290 million in shareholder value.

Further details on the deal and its impact on both companies will be announced by Cummins CEO Tom Linebarger later this year: “Upon closing, we will share more details about the acquisition and our strategy to offer a broad portfolio of power solutions to meet our customers’ needs.” According to the announcement, Cummins expects the transaction to close in the third quarter of 2019.

The US manufacturer Cummins was previously known for its diesel engines, but over the last two years has already made a number of significant and decisive acquisitions in the field of electrically powered vehicles. After presenting the prototype of an electric truck in 2017, Cummins acquired the former electric motorcycle manufacturer and current battery specialist Brammo, followed in February 2018 by the acquisition of Johnson Matthey’s UK division specialising in electric and hybrid vehicles. Just a few months later in July of 2018, Cummins also acquired Efficient Drivetrains, as well as joining the Hydrogen Council. Now, with the acquisition of Hydrogenics, the US firm is setting itself up for rapidly growing markets in zero-emission technologies."
Cameroon imported 305 tons of cheese from France in 2018 - Business in Cameroon,"Wed, 24 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5jYW1lcm9vbi5jb20vZWNvbm9teS8yNDA3LTkzNzQtY2FtZXJvb24taW1wb3J0ZWQtMzA1LXRvbnMtb2YtY2hlZXNlLWZyb20tZnJhbmNlLWluLTIwMTjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Business in Cameroon) - Cameroon imported more than 305 tons of cheese in 2018, France’s national dairy industry council (CNIEL) indicates.

According to Laurent Damiens, CNIEL’s Chief Operations Officer, Strategy & International, despite this volume of exports, Cameroon remains a small market for French milk products. “This does not mean that we are not interested in that market,” he told Investir au Cameroun on July 23, 2019, in Douala, during “Afrogourmands”, an event organized to promote the use of European milk products in African gastronomy.

During the period under review, Cameroon imported 1,835 litres of milk and dairy drinks from France, the same source reveals. Those imports were mainly supplied by large retail chains operating in Cameroon.

There is Casino group, which operates Casino and Leader Price supermarkets in Yaoundé and Douala. There is also Carrefour that recently opened a supermarket in Douala, in the framework of an expansion plan carried out in collaboration with Cfao Retail.

Carrefour, whose project to open a supermarket in Yaoundé is blocked by a land dispute, was preceded in Douala by another French chain Super U.

These chains, which are facing the increased competition of local promoters, sell numerous French milk products and mainly target expatriates and the Cameroonian middle-class.
