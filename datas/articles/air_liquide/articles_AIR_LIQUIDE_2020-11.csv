Air Liquide Deploys Digital Transformation and Revolutionizes Bulk Gases Supply Chain Worldwide - Business Wire,"Thu, 05 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIwMTEwNDAwNTU2MS9lbi9BaXItTGlxdWlkZS1EZXBsb3lzLURpZ2l0YWwtVHJhbnNmb3JtYXRpb24tYW5kLVJldm9sdXRpb25pemVzLUJ1bGstR2FzZXMtU3VwcGx5LUNoYWluLVdvcmxkd2lkZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:

Air Liquide (Paris:AI) is deploying at a global scale its bulk gases supply chain digitalization program, IBO (Integrated Bulk Operations). Digital technology and the associated massive collection of data from production plants to the clients’ sites enable the improvement of operational performance and in particular a reduction in the carbon footprint, in line with the Group’s Climate Objectives. The deployment of IBO in its Industrial Merchant business line will further accelerate Air Liquide’s digital transformation for an always better customer experience.

Delivering gases in liquid form by truck is at the core of Air Liquide’s integrated model. The IBO (Integrated Bulk Operations) program was created in 2017 with the objective of optimizing the bulk supply chain from end to end. Five key pilot projects were launched in several geographies: Canada, U.S., France, Germany and China. They were supported by Air Liquide R&D, Digital and IT teams, which worked in collaboration to develop and industrialize tailor made digital solutions.

By digitally connecting assets throughout the supply chain, from production plants and trucks to tanks at customer sites, Air Liquide collects and analyses data to deliver always better customer experience, higher operational performance and lower carbon footprint through:

Predictive analysis of the customer demand based on his consumption pattern and product inventory

of the customer demand based on his consumption pattern and product inventory Product sourcing optimization based on production costs and plant location

based on production costs and plant location Truck trip optimization to minimize transport costs and carbon footprint

to minimize transport costs and carbon footprint Real time customer information of the delivery

Air Liquide’s bulk activity represents 27% of the Industrial Merchant (IM) revenues1. It serves customers for example in Food & Beverage, Electronics or Glass & Metals markets with liquid gases from the Group production sites. It also supplies internally the filling centers which will then serve customers with gases in cylinders.

Matthieu Giard, Vice President and Executive Committee Member of Air Liquide Group, supervising the Industrial Merchant business line, said: “Industrial Merchant is at the same time, the Air Liquide historical core business and a business that changes fast leveraging data and digital. The deployment of our bulk gases supply chain digitalization program IBO, on a global scale, is a new and significant step in the Air Liquide customer-centric transformation. Customers will now benefit from a service that guarantees greater safety and reliability, in the context of an approach that also helps to reduce the overall carbon footprint. ""

How will China build its Hydrogen economy? - Energy Post,"Wed, 04 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vZW5lcmd5cG9zdC5ldS9ob3ctd2lsbC1jaGluYS1idWlsZC1pdHMtaHlkcm9nZW4tZWNvbm9teS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What are China’s hydrogen prospects? That’s the question Kevin Tu at the IFRI Center for Energy & Climate attempts to answer in a report that he summarises here. He points at the growing number of policies that show China is taking hydrogen very seriously. China wants to expand production as well as build up end uses in transport, steel and cement manufacturing, and storage. The main drivers are the Covid pandemic, energy security, the US-China trade war, and their new net-zero emissions targets. Its manufacturing muscle and potential home market can make it a hydrogen production leader. But Tu says China lags behind other advanced economies in key hydrogen-related technologies. He sees the opening up of the Chinese hydrogen market creating a win-win between China and the international community.

China’s hydrogen plans will be examined by an Energy Post panel on Nov 18th at 09.00-10.30 CET.

This study assesses the prospects of a hydrogen economy with Chinese characteristics. Against the backdrop of an escalating US-China trade war and the ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, key Chinese stakeholders become increasingly interested in moving the hydrogen economy agenda forward.

During the first six months of 2020 alone, 37 policies in support of the hydrogen economy have been published by various level governments, including 7 by central government authorities, and 30 by local governments. Shandong alone issued 6 hydrogen supporting policies, followed with 5 by Guangdong. In sum, hydrogen economy development is not only gaining traction in China, but is also in great danger of overheating.

Transport, Steel and Cement, Storage, Gas Grid

The ambition in China is to expand hydrogen production and create new end-uses: in the transport segment (e.g. 1 million fuel cell electric vehicles – FCEVs – and 1,000 hydrogen refuelling stations by 2030), but possibly also, in other hard-to-abate sectors such as steel and cement manufacturing or in the electricity storage segment (Power to X).

Hydrogen production from low carbon electricity could bring many benefits, notably to address curtailments of renewable electricity from wind, solar and hydro. It could also be blended into the nation-wide gas grid especially for low-concentration hydrogen (e.g. 5-10%).

2060: China’s carbon neutrality target

Until recently, China’s interest in developing the hydrogen economy has not been primarily triggered by the decarbonisation objective. Nevertheless, on 22 September 2020, Chinese president Xi Jinping announced that China aims to peak national carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060.

Given the significant amount of carbon emissions reduction implied by the above announcement, hydrogen is now expected to play a much more important role to drastically decrease the country’s greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) over time.

China’s very large hydrogen production from fossil fuels, mainly coal, would make it quite challenging to consider decarbonising the current uses of hydrogen. What decisively drives the current interest into hydrogen is innovation and technological leadership on the one hand, which China can achieve through industrial clusters and economies of scale, and energy security on the other: reducing dependence on imported oil and gas, with rising importance of air pollution control- and decarbonisation-related considerations. It remains to be seen whether China can avoid the shortcomings of its electric vehicles (EV) supporting policies as it aims to boost a hydrogen economy with Chinese characteristics.

Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats

A simplified SWOT analysis presented in the report identifies the most important strength, weakness, opportunity and threat for hydrogen economy development in China:

Strength – ability to significantly bring down unit manufacturing cost through industrial network clustering and economy of scale.

. Opportunity – enthusiasm on hydrogen economy by local governments against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic.

against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic. Threat – looming danger of global supply chain decoupling caused by an escalating US-China trade war.

In order to move the hydrogen economy agenda forward, a preliminary “to do list” for Chinese decision-makers in this field would include:

A coordinated national mechanism should be established at the central government level to lay out principles for moving the hydrogen economy agenda forward in China.

South Africa's Sasol is fighting for survival after $5.5bn bad bet - The Africa Report,"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWFmcmljYXJlcG9ydC5jb20vNTAxNjQvc291dGgtYWZyaWNhcy1zYXNvbC1hLWZpZ2h0LWZvci1zdXJ2aXZhbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Few African chief executives have it as tough as Sasol’s Fleetwood Grobler. Having inherited a costly chemical plant project in the United States, Grobler is trying to right the ship after the firm posted a loss of R91.3bn ($5.5bn) in the year ending June 30 amidst the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Grobler was sanguine in an interview with The Africa Report: “I look at the stage when I put my feet under the desk – it was a volatile time in the company’s history. We had challenges, we still do.”

Grobler was promoted to Sasol president and CEO in late 2019 after joint chief executives Bongani Nqwababa and Stephen Cornell resigned following cost overruns and deadline misses at the Lake Charles Chemicals Project (LCCP). The $12.6bn project is an attempt by Sasol to gain a foothold in the US market and is also meant to serve as a catalyst for Sasol establishing itself as a serious global player in the base and performance chemicals space.

That bet has been disastrous. It made the company exceed its gearing ratio and compromised its balance sheet. This spooked the market and sparked a run on Sasol’s stock. The debt markets, in turn, snubbed the integrated chemicals and energy company. The board stepped in last year and instituted an inquiry to determine the underlying causes of Sasol’s troubles.

It showed a culture bereft of candour and steeped in subservience, which contributed to delays and the concealment of the true costs of the LCCP. Grobler came in as the face of the clean-up. His job has become all the more difficult with COVID-19 causing lower fuel demand and a weaker rand exchange rate.

“One of my first objectives was to set the right tone from the top. I engaged with the people of Sasol in setting objectives […] about speaking up and being transparent. We will continue with all initiatives to manage us through this volatile period,” says Grobler.

Asset sell-off

Sasol has about $10bn in debt, and its weak balance sheet has prevented it from tapping into the debt market. Sasol executives plan to sell off assets to reduce the debt by $6bn in the 2021 financial year.

Deals were in various states of completion in late August. Executives were negotiating with Air Liquide to sell 16 air separation units at Secunda. The sale of a 51% stake in Sasol’s explosives business to Enaex was completed. And the company agreed to sell its indirect stake in Nigeria’s Escravos gas-to-liquids project to supermajor Chevron. Sasol also plans to issue new shares, with a target of a $2bn rights issue in 2021.

Grobler and others have tough decisions to make about about operations, capital projects and the company’s portfolio of assets. Much of the finer detail of the firm’s organisational shake-up is due to be announced in November. The situation is unusual for Sasol. Since its listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange 40 years ago, it has been a consistent performer.

READ MORE South Africa’s Sasol loses over $5bn, eyes painful restructuring

Grobler explains some of the changes: “We have entered early discussions on partnering at our US base-chemicals asset. However, we recognise it is a challenging environment for [mergers and acquisitions], so we do not want to be too specific on timing.”

Grobler and Sasol were bullish about oil prospects in West Africa last year, but that has now changed. “Under the prevailing oil price of around $25 to $45 per barrel, the whole world on oil and investment in terms of these assets has changed,” says Grobler.

“Our activities in Mozambique continue unaffected,” says Grobler, adding: “We have continued gas supply from Mozambique into our operations in South Africa. Furthermore, we continue to do explorations of further gas in Mozambique.”

Environmental wake-up call

Part of Sasol’s package of reforms includes reorganising capital projects in terms of their environmental impact. The company is one of the biggest polluters in South Africa, and says it will no longer invest in coal – instead targeting gas and renewables. Sasol has set a target of producing 600MW from renewable energy sources by 2030 and is starting with two 10MW plants in South Africa. South Africa’s introducion of a carbon tax in 2019 has cost implications for companies such as Sasol.

READ MORE South Africa: Sasol rejects AGM climate motion, again

In response to complaints by environmental lobby groups, Sasol has compiled a climate-change report. By 2030, it says it wants to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions at its South African operations by at least 10% “off our 2017 baseline”.

These plans might be delayed because of the urgent task of resetting Sasol balance’s sheet. “On our interaction with government, we will reshape that [environmental initiatives] portfolio. Also around year end, we will give more sense of what will shift. That process has started and we are making progress,” says Grobler.

French company Flying Whales is bringing back the airship - Globetrender,"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmV0cmVuZGVyLmNvbS8yMDIwLzExLzE4L2ZyZW5jaC1jb21wYW55LWZseWluZy13aGFsZXMtYnJpbmdpbmctYmFjay1haXJzaGlwL9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmV0cmVuZGVyLmNvbS8yMDIwLzExLzE4L2ZyZW5jaC1jb21wYW55LWZseWluZy13aGFsZXMtYnJpbmdpbmctYmFjay1haXJzaGlwL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The blimp is back – Flying Whales is designing helium-lifted airships to access the inaccessible. Olivia Palamountain reports

After the Hindenburg disaster in 1937, the era of the airship was deemed well and truly over. But French company Flying Whales is determined to explore the full potential of the airship with the launch of its first craft slated for 2024.

The project was launched in 2012 after a series of discussions with the Office National des Forêts (ONF – French National Forestry Office), which thought an airship would be particularly effective in targeting hard-to-access natural resources in areas such as the Alps, Corsica and French Guiana.

The LCA60T airship will be able to transport up to 60 metric tons of goods at altitudes of close to 3,000 metres. Airships could soon be a solution for countries with such vast expanses of territory.

Romain Schalck, market manager at Flying Whales told Air Liquide: “Airships could be used to collect tree trunks without impacting the ground by hovering above the site and loading and unloading cargo using cables.”

In addition to France, Canada (specifically the province of Quebec) and China, through its state-owned company AVIC (Aviation Industry Corporation of China), have also shown interest by investing in the project.

In the UK, Hybrid Air Vehicles is developing the Airlander airship for both cargo and sightseeing purposes. It will be able to hold up to 40 people for a banquet, or 16 passengers for an overnight stay in private suites.

How much will a Flying Whales airship cost?

As of now, the price of the aircraft is confidential, but it’s suggested that the price tag is closer to that of a helicopter than a plane.

Several components of the cargo transport airship are made to be environmentally friendly, such as its floating capabilities powered by helium, hybrid-electric propulsion system, and lack of need for extra infrastructure during take-offs and landings.

Since the air vehicle uses helium to hover, the LCA60T has a low fuel consumption compared to traditional aircrafts.

The hybrid electric propulsion system that powers the airship also gives Flying Whales the opportunity to pivot to full electric propulsion in the future, further decreasing the airship’s carbon footprint.

“We decided to equip the first airship with hybrid propulsion first because we think today, we are in a world in which we cannot create new industrial tools without taking into account the protection of the environment,” Schalck said.

“A hybrid electric propulsion is not the perfect saver for the environment, but it’s a good first step.”

However, there is an issue with Flying Whales ambitious plan: the world is almost out of helium.

In recent years, helium prices have skyrocketed as supply has dwindled, says Foreign Policy. Far from just being used in party balloons and blimps, the gas is necessary for MRI scanners and rocket engines. Stockpiles of helium often escape, and are wasted, during other extractive projects.

While there have been shortages before, helium is a nonrenewable resource and can take an enormously long time to generate. Estimates suggest the Earth’s supply could be gone this century. So for blimps to be a sustainable form of air travel, another method of levitation needs to be found (hydrogen is flammable so not an option).

Shell and Exxon are aiming for multi-billion dollar green subsidies - Royal Dutch Shell plc .com,"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vcm95YWxkdXRjaHNoZWxscGxjLmNvbS8yMDIwLzExLzE2L3NoZWxsLWFuZC1leHhvbi1hcmUtYWltaW5nLWZvci1tdWx0aS1iaWxsaW9uLWRvbGxhci1ncmVlbi1zdWJzaWRpZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"English translation of an article published today by the Dutch Financial newspaper, the FD.

Shell and Exxon are aiming for multi-billion dollar green subsidies

Carel Grol: 16 November 2020

Four multinationals that want to store the greenhouse gas CO₂ in an empty gas field off the Dutch coast will apply for a subsidy at the end of this month. According to estimates, this subsidy could amount to around € 1.5 billion.

In brief

Four multinationals, including Shell, want to participate in a large-scale CO₂ storage project in a gas field under the North Sea.

It is estimated that a subsidy of € 1.5 billion will be applied for.

If the subsidy is paid, there will be less money for solar energy.

Four multinationals, including Exxon and Shell, will apply for a subsidy for CO₂ storage in a gas field under the North Sea. This grant is controversial as it is a huge amount for something that has never been done on this scale. There are less than 25 active large CO₂ storage projects worldwide. The so-called Porthos project in the North Sea should really be a breakthrough for Europe.

CO₂ is captured from the flue gas that is released when fossil fuels are burned. This is transported via pipelines to, in this case, an empty gas field. In Rotterdam, Road has already been worked on for years, also a project to store CO₂ under the seabed. Despite € 150 million in subsidy, of which about 10% has been paid out, Road was not realized.

Shell, ExxonMobil, Air Liquide and Air Products are therefore making a second attempt with Porthos. To this end, they will claim subsidies for greening the Dutch energy facilities (SDE). Until now, this money has mainly gone to the construction of solar meadows and wind turbines. From 24 November, companies can also apply for a subsidy for the capture and storage of CO₂, or CCS (carbon capture and storage).

EU money

The subsidy application is still waiting for the final signatures, say spokespersons for both Shell and ExxonMobil. But it is evident that the application will be made. Last month it was announced that the European Commission wants to provide a subsidy of € 102 million. If the companies apply for a subsidy, there is a good chance that they will also receive the money, those involved say to the FD.

Storage in a gas field must prevent CO₂ from entering the air. Last summer, Minister Eric Wiebes of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy wrote that since 2008 the government has paid out approximately € 4.5 billion in SDE subsidies. With those billions, about 42 megatonnes of CO₂ emissions have been saved.

If all goes well, Porthos should save about 37 megatonnes of CO₂ emissions in fifteen years. With a subsidy of an estimated € 1.5 billion. “CCS is cheaper than almost all other measures,” said a Shell spokesperson.

‘Technical and social experiment’

‘It is a technical experiment, and therefore also a social experiment. You have to question whether it will work out, ‘says Ebel Kemeling of consultancy MJ Hudson Spring about Porthos. “So this could be a political target.”

He wonders whether CO₂ capture is ‘the new biomass’. Energy companies received billions in subsidies to burn wood pellets in coal-fired power stations. There was more and more resistance. Co-firing also leads to CO₂ emissions and opponents pointed out that trees were cut down in North America to disappear in Dutch coal-fired power stations.

Resistance to co-firing reached as far as political The Hague. This summer, the government coalition decided to stop providing new subsidies for the combustion of woody biomass in power stations. Kemeling: ‘Even now we play billions to the large companies.’

The CO₂ capture will soon be largely financed by households, via the Sustainable Energy Storage (ODE), which every household in the Netherlands pays. Wind and solar projects are also financed with this storage. Only with sun and wind was already experience, where Porthos is unexplored territory. And money for CO₂ capture does not go to wind and solar projects.

‘Storage not a sustainable energy supply’

Alex Kaat, head of public affairs at industry association Holland Solar, fears that the subsidy row will soon be partly empty before solar parks are next. “This is the ghost for many solar park developers,” he says of CCS. The production of green electricity and the capture of CO₂ are different techniques, says Kaat. The Sustainable Energy Storage is intended for the generation of green energy. CO₂ capture does not provide energy, but captures emissions. His conclusion: “It’s actually unfair competition.”

Yet it seems certain that CCS will come. The capture and storage of CO₂ is an objective in the Climate Agreement. The Netherlands will not achieve its climate targets without CO₂ capture. For Chairman Olof van der Gaag of the Dutch Sustainable Energy Association, CO₂ capture was not our preference, but it is an acceptable compromise. Ultimately, I would rather have CO₂ underground than in the air. ‘

Kemeling is in favor of CO₂ capture, but not with SDE as financing. The subsidy assumes that we know and can weigh up what CCS costs. ‘It has never been proven. Not on this scale, not in gas fields, ‘he says. “It’s a blow in the air.”

IGL going after export markets as medical oxygen producer - Jamaica Gleaner,"Sun, 22 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vamFtYWljYS1nbGVhbmVyLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjAxMTIyL2lnbC1nb2luZy1hZnRlci1leHBvcnQtbWFya2V0cy1tZWRpY2FsLW94eWdlbi1wcm9kdWNlctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Industrial Gases Limited, IGL, is sole local producer of medical-grade oxygen distributed to the health sector and food-grade nitrogen distributed mostly to drinks manufacturers or otherwise used in food processing, and continues to dominate the market as a producer, having set up a plant a year ago at Ferry, Kingston.

The air separation unit, ASU, on which IGL spent US$10 million, is capable of producing 13 tonnes of medical oxygen and other gases per day, according to IGL General Manager Peter Graham. Since the commodity is highly prized in the age of COVID, sourcing it on foreign markets is uncertain.

“With the advent of COVID-19, it has been every man for himself, as they say. There was a point where nobody was exporting medical oxygen, so the local supply would have served us very well, to be honest,” Graham said.

The air we breathe is comprised of 78 per cent nitrogen, 21 per cent oxygen, 0.93 per cent argon, which is used in the manufacture of lightbulbs and welding; and 0.04 per cent carbon dioxide, which is used in the production of carbonated drinks and dry ice. The ASU separates and extracts oxygen and nitrogen from the atmospheric gas.

Even as a producer, IGL also imports the oxygen and nitrogen sometimes, for distribution, due to demand fluctuations.

Headlines Delivered to Your Inbox Sign up for The Gleaner’s morning and evening newsletters.

“Occasionally, we may have to import a small amount, but generally, it has reduced our reliance on imports and the need for foreign exchange,” said Graham, adding that the annual foreign exchange savings was in the order of US$2 million.

Critical to the operation of the air separation plant is an integrated 1.5MW power plant, which is fuelled by LNG supplied to IGL by New Fortress Energy.

The power plant is to be developed further under a two-part project, the first requiring an investment of about US$1 million to add components that will allow IGL to collect exhaust gases, and convert the otherwise wasted carbon dioxide, CO2, to food-grade purity for use in manufacturing.

“Some of the components of the CO2 plant were already in place, using the US$10 million, but there will be an additional [investment] of around US$1 million or so. The equipment is on order and due to arrive any time now. That should be up and running by Q1 of 2020,” Graham said.

The second phase calls for the expansion and retrofitting of the plant, which currently has a rated capacity of 13 tonnes/day, and could be upsized by about 50 per cent.

In the meantime, IGL is already scouting for markets outside Jamaica.

“The next step is exports because, outside of Trinidad, we are the only plant in the region. The first goal was to size it to meet local demand, the next move is to be a net earner because the market is out there,” Graham said. The Trinidad producer is Air Liquide Trinidad & Tobago, a global industrial gas company.

IGL has been in Jamaica for over 50 years, producing a range of gases for industry and the health sector from its plant at Ferry, and operating a filling plant for LPG and some industrial gases, such as chlorine, from Spanish Town Road, Kingston. The company is said to have a near monopoly over the medical oxygen and nitrogen markets, with other players said to be inconsequential.

Maximum oxygen

SELAQUI: Subhas Kumar Yadav has fought fear, deadlines and hunger to truck liquid oxygen from a factory in the Himalayan foothills to hospitals in the northern plains during the coronavirus epidemic.The worst time, he said, was in the weeks after the federal government imposed a sweeping lockdown to contain the disease in late March, when roads were deserted, police made arbitrary checks and roadside restaurants, repair shops and motels were shuttered.But the oxygen he was carrying was saving the lives of thousands of those infected.“We were on duty,” said the 33-year-old driver with Linde India Ltd , an affiliate of the world’s largest supplier of industrial gases, Linde Plc. “It’s not like we could just give up and go home.”With India’s COVID-19 infections surging since March and many patients struggling to breathe, hospitals have scrambled to secure supplies of medical oxygen, increasing pressure on people like Yadav and companies like Linde to deliver them in time.The government says demand for medical oxygen has jumped four times here to about 2,800 tonnes a day, prompting some states to restrict movement here of the commodity from local factories to other regions. Around half of the total liquid oxygen production in India is now being used for medical needs, up from only 15% earlier.Linde, which competes with nearly two dozen oxygen suppliers in India, including France’s Air Liquide, has responded by tweaking its production lines away from industrial gases like nitrogen and argon, company officials told Reuters.It has also deployed its entire fleet of trucks, bringing back even grounded vehicles, to deliver medical oxygen to hospitals across the country, many of them in the hinterlands with limited storage capacity.“Despite the limitations, there has not been a single stock-out situation for our partner hospitals,” Linde India said.Still, as infections peaked in India in mid-September, hospitals in some parts of the country were left gasping for oxygen.The government says supplies have since stabilised. It has also floated a global tender to import 100,000 tonnes of oxygen. Linde said it is considering shipping in the commodity, besides bringing additional containers, from its facilities outside the country.India has the world’s second highest number of confirmed coronavirus infections at more than 8 million, behind only the United States.But deaths-per-million people ratio of around 88 is one of the lowest in the world among hard hit countries, and the government has said getting oxygen to critical patients in time has played a key role.Linde India’s factory in Selaqui, at the foot of the Himalayas in northern India, is set up to produce 154 tonnes of oxygen daily, but since the pandemic, the facility has churned out up to 161 tonnes.“We did maximum oxygen production,” said Surendra Singh, a Linde India business head. “Almost 85-90% went to medical (clients).”It helped that industrial demand itself had come down because of the lockdown, though the reopening of the economy could change that.To ship the oxygen to hospitals - the furthest is 680 km (420 miles), a two-day drive away - and two regional depots, the factory depends on a fleet of 33 container trucks and a pool of 66 drivers.Its fleet has on-board cameras, GPS trackers and elaborate safety procedures to ensure timely deliveries - rare aids for Indian truckers.Then, its drivers discovered that all the roadside restaurants and motels where they would stop for a meal or a night’s rest were shuttered. So the factory’s small canteen provided them with packed meals, along with biscuits and dry fruit.Despite masks and protective gear, drivers also worried about catching the virus when they had to spend hours inside hospital compounds, transferring liquid oxygen from their vehicles to storage tanks, sometimes located next to mortuaries.Now, with India’s daily coronavirus cases dropping, there is some comfort among Linde officials and its frontline drivers.But experts have warned that coronavirus cases may surge during the winter, again putting pressure on medical infrastructure, including oxygen supplies, even as industrial use of the gas picks up.And despite a challenging seven months on the highway, drivers like Yadav said they were prepared for more.“Doctors are working hard, the nurses are working hard, and we are doing our part,” Yadav said. “If we give up, then the hospitals will close down.”"

"Pakistan Oxygen to invest Rs6.3 billion to expand oxygen, nitrogen production - Profit by Pakistan Today","Sat, 28 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vcHJvZml0LnBha2lzdGFudG9kYXkuY29tLnBrLzIwMjAvMTEvMjgvcGFraXN0YW4tb3h5Z2VuLXRvLWludmVzdC1yczYtMy1iaWxsaW9uLXRvLWV4cGFuZC1veHlnZW4tbml0cm9nZW4tcHJvZHVjdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If you are wondering how the industrial gases company Pakistan Oxygen managed to nab such a succinct, yet all encompassing, name, it is because the company is literally older than the country itself. The company started in 1935, as the Indian Oxygen and Acetylene Company. The Karachi office opened in 1946, just in time for independence. This then became the Pakistan Oxygen and Acetylene Company, renamed the Pakistan Oxygen Company in 1958, when it also became a publicly listed company (around 60% was held by British industrial gas company BOC Group).

Supplying industrial and medical gases is somewhat complicated. The company sells nitrogen, oxygen, argin, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide. These require air separation units, speciality gases labs, and hydrogen and carbon dioxide production units. Large quantities are sent through-onsite pipelines, while medium quantities are sent by tankers, and small quantities are shipped in cylinders. These are then used in the chemicals, metals, oil, food, and healthcare industries.

As Pakistan’s various industries have grown in the last 70 years, so has Pakistan Oxygen. In 1997, BOC Pakistan installed what was at the time Pakistan’s largest air separation unit in Port Qasim, capable of producing up to 100 tonnes per day of oxygen, nitrogen and argon. Another air separation unit was set up in Taxila in 2000, to meet demand in northern Pakistan.

In 2004, a carbon dioxide plant was set up in Multan for the growing beverage sector. In 2012, the company unveiled the largest air separation unit (133 tonnes per day) in Lahore. In 2019, it had 12 plants concentrated in Sindh and Punjab, including three air separation units (the one in Lahore, and two in Port Qasim). Separately, the company also runs a welding and hardgoods segment, through its electrode manufacturing facility in Karachi.

But that is still not enough. So in April 2018, the board of directors approved an investment plan of Rs4.4 billion for the largest air separation plant, capable of producing upto 250 tonnes per day. This was expected to come on board in the second quarter of 2020.

Where did this ambitious new plan come from? Well, from the new owners. BOC globally had been bought by the German company Linde in 2006, and BOC Pakistan formally became Linde Pakistan in 2011. Linde Pakistan sold its majority shareholding in January 2018, which was bought up by Adira Capital (33%), Hilton Pharma (23%) and Soorty Enterprises (12%).

However, despite the enthusiasm, the plan had to be somewhat altered. In March 2019, the company announced that the new investment plan was for Rs5.1 billion, and expect to operate in the fourth quarter of 2021. “The increase in project size is primarily on account of rupee depreciation and increase in interest rates,” the company explained. According to the company’s own estimate, the manufacturing capacity would increase by 95%.

In October 2019, Pakistan Oxygen agreed to source the 250 tonne air separation plant for Air Liquide, a french company. Sadly, this never materialised. In February 2020, Air Liquide broke off the agreement, citing force majeure. The global Covid-19 pandemic had affected the company’s production plant in Hangzhou, in China.

So now, it was time for option two. Pakistan Oxygen went back to its original owners, Linde, to ask for a brand new air separation unit. In a notice sent to the PSX on November 20, the company shared details of its new investment plan worth Rs6.3 billion. The extra time has allowed for a newer, more efficient plant, capable of producing 270 tons per day.

“The plant is superior due to higher capacity, better specific power Consumption, product quality, reliability and advanced control system,” the company noted. This brand new plant will expect to operate in 2023.

And just as well. For the last ten years, the company has done comfortably well – the key word here being comfortably. In 2010 sales stood at Rs2,530 million, crossing the Rs4,000 mark in 2013, and hovering thereabouts until 2018, when it reached a peak of Rs4,860 million. Meanwhile, profit after taxation in 2010 stood at Rs244 million, dipping in the years between 2013 and 2018, before an impressive showing of Rs399 million in 2018.

Perhaps because 2018 was such an impressive year, that 2019 seemed worse off, even though it was historically one of the better years. According to that year’s directors report, the company was affected by the complete shutdown of the shipbreaking sector, but was helped by growth in medical engineering solutions.

However, Pakistan Oxygen suffered from the sharp increase in electricity tariffs, particularly in the last quarter of 2019, with the full year increase of almost 74%. Since power costs make up 90% of the variable costs of production of gases, this severely increased the company’s input costs. Finance costs increased by 49% or Rs 57 million, over the year, mainly due to increase in interest rates. The company also utilized higher credit facilities during the year 2019, which led to an additional impact of Rs 17 million over last year. That is why Pakistan Oxygen’s profit after tax in 2019 stood at Rs301 million and earnings per share of Rs9.23, compared to 2018’s profit after tax of Rs399 million and earnings per share of Rs12.25.

Could a massive expansion be what the company needs, to avoid even minor slumps? Seems like that is what the owners think so too."
Samsung Engineering awarded 1.2 trillion won methanol plant order in Malaysia - EconoTimes,"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb25vdGltZXMuY29tL1VTLWVjb25vbXktZ3Jldy1hdC1hbi11bnJldmlzZWQtMzMxLXJhdGUtaW4tdGhlLXRoaXJkLXF1YXJ0ZXItMTU5NzM4NNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Samsung Engineering Co. has received a letter of intent for a 1.2 trillion-won methanol plant order from Malaysian petrochemical company, Sarawak PetChem.

Under the deal, Samsung Engineering will build the plant, which will have a daily capacity of 5,000 tons of methanol, in Bintulu, Sarawak by 2023.

The plant's design would be based on Air Liquide E&C's Lurgi MegaMethanol technology.

Samsung Engineering, which won the contract from Sarawak Petrochem for front-end engineering design (FEED) in April 2019, entered into a partnership with Air Liquide E&C to carry out the FEED study for the project.

Sarawak Petrochem awarded the first Early Work contract to Sarawak Petrochem in November 2019.

Samsung Engineering, an industrial plant affiliate of Samsung Group, has obtained about 9 trillion won worth of plant orders so far this year, comprising 86 percent of its annual target of 10.5 trillion won.

The engineering firm currently has a 17 trillion-won order backlog."
