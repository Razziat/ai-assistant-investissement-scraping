Energy transition: accelerating the transformation of energy usage and production methods - Air Liquide,"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5haXJsaXF1aWRlLmNvbS9zdG9yaWVzL3N1c3RhaW5hYmlsaXR5L2VuZXJneS10cmFuc2l0aW9uLWFjY2VsZXJhdGluZy10cmFuc2Zvcm1hdGlvbi1lbmVyZ3ktdXNhZ2UtYW5kLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tbWV0aG9kc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Director of the ""Energy and Climate"" Center at the French Institute of International Relations (IFRI), Marc-Antoine Eyl-Mazzega delivers his vision of the energy transition and the technologies that should play a key role in the development of a low-carbon economy.

The European Union faced many geopolitical and economic upheavals in 2022 including hydrocarbon supply difficulties and rising energy prices. This situation has provoked an accelerated shift in both energy usage and production methods by encouraging the adoption of low-carbon technologies. It has also triggered a historic surge in public policy. This momentum is happening on a global scale. In the United States for example, the Inflation Reduction Act (1) is encouraging companies to invest in green energy.

Will the European Union be able to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, while securing its current energy needs?

Undoubtedly, even if the issue has become more complex and costly since 2022, with the succession of geopolitical and economic shocks. The European Union is facing a disruption to its hydrocarbon supplies following the sudden decoupling from Russia and the explosion in import costs. This has made the challenges of the energy transition all the more pressing in terms of developing renewable energies, flexibility and storage solutions, or access to the resources needed for the new low-carbon hydrogen and electric mobility sectors.

However, these disruptions have had positive effects by reinforcing the urgent need to accelerate decarbonization and by triggering a historic surge in national and European public policies. They have mobilized and brought together all stakeholders in Europe, from governments to businesses and consumers. Additionally, they may accelerate a change in production methods and uses in a sustainable way, and the promotion of low-carbon technologies.

What about the evolution of technologies and pathways?

Reducing CO₂ emissions first involves lowering demand, decarbonizing electricity production, electrifying uses and gradually inserting low-carbon hydrogen where it makes sense. More than 30 countries around the world, including France, have made hydrogen a key component of their industrial recovery plans. Hydrogen and its derivatives will play a fundamental role in the decarbonization of steel, air and sea transport, and some public transport. They will also contribute to the flexibility of the electricity system, petrochemicals and even fertilizers. The use of low-carbon hydrogen will develop progressively, both through electrolysis production – the power of electrolysis units is in the process of being scaled up to reach several tens of megawatts – and also through production methods using raw materials such as biomethane. To be effective, decarbonization will require a focus on low-carbon hydrogen from all sources, including natural gas and nuclear.

For industries whose emissions are difficult to reduce, such as cement, steel and chemicals, carbon capture, storage, reuse and burial (CCUS) technologies are also very promising.

What roles do governments and industrial companies have to play in this context?

Their synergies are essential to making the entire low-carbon value chain viable and efficient. This will be done through private-public partnerships, innovation funds and projects of common interest, and above all, clear objectives and predictable incentive policies.

Industry and public authorities are already working together to support the development of research centers and sites dedicated to decarbonized hydrogen, electric batteries, ecological mobility, eco-design and eco-production. This is already the case in several regions in France (Hauts-de-France, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, Normandy), as well as in the Netherlands and Belgium. By increasing its capacities in decarbonized energies and sectors, the European Union will strengthen its autonomy and represent a virtuous model for the rest of the world economy.

Elsewhere in the world, the same dynamic is at work. In the United States, the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act is already opening up new opportunities and encouraging business investment in green energy and low-carbon production methods."
Air Liquide (AIQUY) is a Great Momentum Stock: Should You Buy? - Yahoo Finance,"Mon, 17 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9haXItbGlxdWlkZS1haXF1eS1ncmVhdC1tb21lbnR1bS0xNjAwMDQzMTYuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.

Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.

Below, we take a look at Air Liquide (AIQUY), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.

It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Air Liquide currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.

Set to Beat the Market?

Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for AIQUY that show why this company shows promise as a solid momentum pick.

A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.

For AIQUY, shares are up 3.53% over the past week while the Zacks Chemical - Diversified industry is down 1.71% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 11.05% compares favorably with the industry's 4.24% performance as well.

Story continues

While any stock can see its price increase, it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics -- such as performance over the past three months or year -- can be useful as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Air Liquide have risen 10.13%, and are up 9.46% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 3.88% and -4.3%, respectively.

Investors should also take note of AIQUY's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, AIQUY is averaging 123,519 shares for the last 20 days.

Earnings Outlook

The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with AIQUY.

Over the past two months, 2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost AIQUY's consensus estimate, increasing from $1.32 to $1.34 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.

Bottom Line

Taking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that AIQUY is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Air Liquide on your short list.

Air Liquide started 2023 with a very solid performance. In the first quarter, growth was higher than in the fourth quarter and its investment momentum remained strong. Group sales increased by +6.2% on a comparable basis, after growth of +4.5% in the fourth quarter. As published, sales were up by +4.2% year-over-year, integrating in particular the decline in energy prices, whose variations are passed on to Large Industries customers. Revenue reached 7.2 billion euros, including 6.9 billion euros for the Gas & Services business. The Gas & Services business, which represents 96% of the Group’s revenue, was up +6.7% on a comparable basis and that of Global Markets & Technologies was up +2.8%, with divestitures impacting growth this quarter. Sales to third-party Engineering & Construction customers decreased by -18.6%; the outlook remaining solid with a high level of internal and external order intake. Within Gas & Services, all our geographies posted comparable growth, in particular the Americas. By business line, Industrial Merchant and Electronics remained on a strong upward trend; growth in Healthcare accelerated and Large Industries recovered compared to the fourth quarter in a more favorable energy price environment in Europe. In line with the priorities of its strategic plan, ADVANCE, Air Liquide continued to improve its operational performance. The Group generated significant efficiencies of 91 million euros, up +18.1% year-over-year despite an inflationary environment unfavorable to savings on purchases, and continued dynamic management of its business portfolio. The Group’s ability to create value allows it to adjust its prices in Industrial Merchant (+13%) while preserving sales volumes. The cashflow progressed by +14.3% in the first quarter. Investment decisions amounted to close to 800 million euros. 12-month investment opportunities continued to rise, reaching 3.4 billion euros. More than 40% of these opportunities are related to the energy transition, with in particular decarbonization projects in the United States. In 2023, the Group will continue deployment of its ADVANCE strategic plan. Air Liquide is conﬁdent in its ability to further increase its operating margin and to deliver recurring net proﬁt growth, at constant exchange rates[1].

Antoine Tournand, Vice President of H2 Mobility Solutions, spoke to PetrolPlaza about their plans to roll-out 100 hydrogen stations for HDVs in Europe, why H2 and heavy-duty are a great match, and his reaction to EU’s announcement on AFIR.

Last update: April 21, 2023

Author: Oscar Smith Diamante

Antoine Tournand, Vice President of H2 Mobility Solutions at TotalEnergies | © TotalEnergies

TotalEnergies recently announced plans to roll out 100 hydrogen stations for heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) in Benelux, France and Germany with Air Liquide. How did this project come about?

We are an important player for heavy-duty mobility in Europe through TotalEnergies and our other brand AS24, a very important player with over 1,200 stations in 29 countries. It was important for us to serve our customers and provide a decarbonization solution for transport. TotalEnergies opened its first hydrogen station in Germany in 2002 more focused on light-duty vehicles (LDVs). After that we were a founding member of H2 Mobility, an important hydrogen player in Germany. In 2021, we constituted the Hydrogen Mobility Solutions (H2MS) business unit, which aggregates all the projects taking place in our affiliate.

Dealing with hydrogen, we realized that it was valuable to partner with a competent player for the molecule and equipment. We know how to manage and operate retail stations, and we have the customer base. We found that partner in Air Liquide. This process led to the announcement of a 50/50 shared company to develop 100 or more stations in Europe with a focus on France, Germany and the Benelux – the core markets of our operations and key European transport areas. Our joint conviction is that hydrogen provides real benefits to heavy-duty mobility and its long-term decarbonization.

Do you expect these European markets you mention to be the first to develop in the hydrogen mobility space?

International transport is the preferred segment for H2 to develop due to its intensive use. The countries we are taking about are really at the centre of Europe. They represent a big part of our customer base. It's also important to make commitments in a geographic space that allows our customers to plan routes. We are not restricted to these five countries but they are the focus for now.

Will all the 100 stations be added to existing TotalEnergies and AS24 stations? Or will you also build new sites?

The idea is to have stations along main European corridors following the general view of Europe and the subsidy programs. Some of them will be on existing stations from our two brands but we are also considering the opening of stations on brownfields. The network will be branded TotalEnergies in any case.

Today we have four operating stations which have both 350 and 700 bar. We will focus on 700 bar going forward. In terms of capacity, we want to start with the general view of 1,000kg of capacity per day, with a possible extension in the future.

TotalEnergy is in an interesting position having been a leader in the liquid fuels sector, investing lots of resources into EV, and now with an ambitious hydrogen strategy. What role do you see hydrogen playing the future European transport sector?

Regarding international long-haul, hydrogen is definitely part of the solution. BEVs will be the biggest drivers of decarbonization in transport. H2 has its best competitive advantage in heavy-duty due to the intensive use. It allows quick refilling (comparable to diesel), it gives long autonomy (up to 1,000km), and it safeguards a key element for transporters, the payload. It’s a market that will take time to scale up. The expectations for commercialization of trucks in Europe is for the biggest players to begin in 2027. We expect the sector to increase significantly by the end of the decade. That is why we are planning these 100 stations over a 10-year period. It's a general ecosystem process – we need to put in the infrastructure, the OEMs need to provide vehicles, and customers have to get used to the process.

In recent years there has been a clear shift from hydrogen passenger vehicles to HDVs. Do you still see a future for light-duty hydrogen vehicles?

In general, light-duty transportation will be BEV. Most of the time these cars are not moving – they can recharge at home, the office or malls. The key word is intensive. When it comes to intensive, with no time for long stops, there might be cases where H2 is interesting in light-duty. We are a shareholder in HysetCo, a pioneer in H2 light-vehicle mobility in Paris. Although we think heavy-duty is where hydrogen will have its more important role to play, we remain involved in lighter mobility.

What are your thoughts on the recent EU agreement on AFIR that will require hydrogen stations every 200KM on major corridors and urban nodes? Is this enough support for companies like TotalEnergies to heavily invest in new solutions?

The main message is that the preliminary focus for H2 is heavy-duty. We are fully aligned with the vision to focus on TEN-T corridors (Trans-European Transport Network) and urban nodes as part of an international approach. TotalEnergies supports this international view. The second important message is that the AFIR statement is aware that the landscape changes rapidly. They say they will reassess the market in 2024 including the technical part. Everyone would have been happier with 150km per site instead of 200km but when you consider that it will be revised, it's an important and positive step. The market will take some time to mature – we need the trucks to come in – but between 2027 and 2033 it will accelerate strongly. By that time, we hope AFIR will have changed to the 100KM mark. It's a positive sign to see public support for hydrogen stations. We will contribute to kickstart this market.

Do you see a lot of interest from transport companies and OEMs to increase the number of FCEVs on the roads?

There are positive signals. There was a lot of expectation around AFIR and the European programs because it's a very cost-intensive business. These trucks can be three to five times more expensive that traditional ones – that is why the logic of an ecosystems is so important. To take the next step the customer expects to have the truck and the infrastructure. We see lots of customers willing to take the risk of changing their fleets but we need to work together. The consortium and association format, like the ones that we are a part of (H2 Accelerator), are key to keep a connection between us.

TotalEnergies recently sold its service station business in a number of key European markets. What role does the company want to play in the future mobility and transport ecosystem?

TotalEnergies is fully committed to providing solutions for the decarbonization of the sector. AS24 is the main infrastructure for this sector with a strong customer base. That is why we are designing these stations.

We see mobility changing. If you look at light-duty vehicles, ending the sale of ICE vehicles in 2035 is very important. Mobility is turning electric. We want to accompany mobility to these new energies. We are deploying charging points and hydrogen stations in major roads in Europe. TotalEnergies is contributing to this transition by investing in the future – a future that’s electric.

HyVelocity Gulf Coast Hydrogen Hub applies for U.S. Department of Energy “Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub Funding” - American Journal of Transportation,"Mon, 10 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ham90LmNvbS9uZXdzL2h5dmVsb2NpdHktZ3VsZi1jb2FzdC1oeWRyb2dlbi1odWItYXBwbGllcy1mb3ItdS5zLWRlcGFydG1lbnQtb2YtZW5lcmd5LXJlZ2lvbmFsLWNsZWFuLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLWh1Yi1mdW5kaW5n0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"posted by AJOT | Apr 10 2023 at 09:05 AM

Today, the HyVelocity Hub team announced that it has applied for funding from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) $8 billion Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs to rapidly scale clean hydrogen supply and demand along the U.S. Gulf Coast in Texas and Southwest Louisiana, and help deliver affordable, reliable, and abundant clean energy and well-paying jobs to local communities. The HyVelocity team was encouraged by the DOE to officially apply for funding after submitting an initial concept paper in November.

The Gulf Coast is well situated for a clean hydrogen hub as it contains the world’s largest concentration of existing hydrogen production assets, customers, and energy infrastructure, with a network of 48 hydrogen production plants and over 1,000 miles of dedicated hydrogen pipelines. The HyVelocity Hub builds on the Gulf Coast’s unrivaled energy assets and will leverage federal investments to advance the global clean hydrogen market, help to decarbonize multiple sectors of the economy, and deliver the benefits of clean energy to historically disadvantaged communities.

HyVelocity’s plans will accelerate DOE’s clean hydrogen policy goals, including its Hydrogen Shot, which is seeking to decrease carbon emissions to not more than 2 kilograms of carbon per 1 kilogram of hydrogen produced and reduce the cost of clean hydrogen by 80% to $1 per 1 kilogram in 1 decade.

Organized by GTI Energy, The Center for Houston’s Future, University of Texas at Austin, and seven major corporate participants—including Air Liquide, Chevron, Orsted, and Sempra Infrastructure—HyVelocity has grown additional support from more than 90 commercial, academic, nonprofit, and government supporters. The hub also has bipartisan support from elected leaders at the federal, state, and local levels of government.

This achievement is part of the European project HEAVEN, a consortium of six companies to demonstrate the feasibility of using liquid, cryogenic hydrogen in aircraft, led by H2FLY.

Joby-backed H2Fly and its partners have completed liquid hydrogen on-ground coupling tests, marking another important step toward the company’s flight test campaign this summer when the HY4 aircraft is expected to fly with liquid hydrogen and fuel cells. H2Fly Image

The new liquid hydrogen storage system, which is designed and supplied by Air Liquide based on H2FLY’s requirements, has been successfully coupled with the fuel cell system on ground. This coupling represents the final technological building block in the development of a complete hydrogen-electric powertrain using liquid hydrogen to power the HY4 – H2FLY’s four-seater demonstrator aircraft which runs on hydrogen and fuel cells producing zero-emissions and demonstrating the feasibility of hydrogen-electric propulsion systems for aircraft. The company led the test campaign on Air Liquide’s Campus Technologies Grenoble, in Sassenage, France together with Air Liquide.

The successful coupling tests mark another important step toward the upcoming ground and flight test campaign this summer when the HY4 is expected to be the first passenger aircraft to fly with liquid hydrogen and fuel cells.

H2FLY is the first company to successfully perform on-ground coupling tests with an aircraft- integrated LH2 tank and fuel cell system proving its pioneering technological advancements with fuel cell systems, hydrogen storage systems and H2 fuel system design for CS-23 and CS-25 aircraft. CS-23 and CS-25 are regulations established by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) ensuring that aircraft meet the necessary standards for certification.

Furthermore, the company has established specialist knowledge when handling liquid hydrogen as it worked together with Air Liquide to develop new safety concepts in preparation for the coupling tests.

Prof. Dr. Josef Kallo, co-founder and CEO of H2FLY says “With the successful passing of the on-ground coupling tests, we have learnt that it will be possible to scale up our technology for a 40-seater aircraft. We are thrilled to be making this crucial progress as we continue our efforts towards making sustainable medium and long-haul flight a reality.”

This coupling milestone follows the company’s announcement last month that it passed its first filling tests with the integrated liquid hydrogen tank.

For more than 8 years, H2FLY has been researching, testing, and refining, resulting in the development of the HY4, a four-seat aircraft with hydrogen-electric propulsion, that first took flight in 2016. There have been several key milestones across the past three years, including:

In 2020 H2FLY was granted a permit to fly the latest generation of the HY4 aircraft, which featured a fully redundant powertrain architecture. Across more than 100 take-offs the company successfully demonstrated the applicability of hydrogen-electric propulsion solutions in aviation

In 2021 the company signed a strategic partnership with aircraft manufacturer Deutsche Aircraft that will see the companies work together to fly a CS25 class aircraft powered by H2FLY’s hydrogen fuel cell technology. The climate-neutral regional aircraft demonstrator is expected to fly in 2025

Earlier last year, the company completed a cross-country flight, from Stuttgart, Germany to Friedrichshafen, covering 77 miles, marking the first time a hydrogen-powered passenger plane has flown between two commercial airports

Also last year, the company set what is believed to be a world altitude record for a hydrogen aircraft, flying at 7,230 feet, confirming the company’s position as a leader in this new category

Advanced materials for sustainable electronics - Air Liquide,"Fri, 21 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi9hZHZhbmNlZC1tYXRlcmlhbHMtc3VzdGFpbmFibGUtZWxlY3Ryb25pY3PSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When people hear ‘advanced materials,’” says Jiro Yokota, “they often think that we are dealing with simple, plug-and-play solutions: ‘Just exchange material A for material B to save X amount of money in production,’” says the Technology Program Manager at Air Liquide Advanced Materials. “But what we do is far more complex – and requires a closer relationship with the customer and a thorough understanding of their production processes.”

We have come to one of Air Liquide’s longest-standing customers, Micron, to get a feel for what Jiro means. For 30 years now, Air Liquide has been supplying the US-based provider of memory storage solutions with the ultra-pure gases required in microchip production. During this time, the electronics industry had expanded rapidly as computers and then smartphones became standard consumer goods, while at the same time cars and household appliances acquired more complex electronic components capable of faster performance and more processing power. All while reducing financial costs and environmental footprint.

“ Our enScribe™ products are designed to reduce the global warming potential typically associated with most contemporary gases used in etch processes. ” Jiro Yokota Technology Program Manager, Advanced Materials, Air Liquide

We are here in Singapore at the Air Liquide Advanced Materials center built for Micron. Located on the western shore of the island state, a couple of miles away from its gleaming center, the facility is an ultra-modern production plant – “the first of its kind,” explains Dylan Low of Air Liquide Singapore. He picks us up at the gates alongside Helena Seiver, Vice President, Strategic Account Management for Micron at Air Liquide, and while we don protective goggles, helmets and overalls for our tour of the plant cleanrooms, she explains her role as “providing one Air Liquide service to one Micron.” This means ensuring that Air Liquide deploys its international reach to support its partner as it, too, expands globally. In this case, the Group opened one of its largest electronics advanced materials production facilities alongside Micron in Singapore.

“ For 30 years, Air Liquide and Micron have grown together. The Singapore Advanced Materials Center, their most recent joint achievement, is the first production plant of its kind. ” Dylan Low Strategic Business Unit Director, Air Liquide Singapore

This strategy of regionalizing supply chains makes them more robust and responsive. With covid-19 lockdowns in place during the construction of Air Liquide’s Advanced Materials center in Singapore, the importance of regional synergies became even more salient. About the partnership with Air Liquide, Jenny Tan, Frontend Global Materials Operations Director at Micron, comments, “Micron and Air Liquide have been successfully collaborating for the last 30 years on various projects that have contributed to Micron’s production efficiency, supply chain resiliency and sustainability efforts. We are excited to continue our long partnership with Air Liquide in the years to come.”

""My role is to 'provide one Air Liquide service to one Micron'. This means ensuring that Air Liquide deploys its international reach to support its partner as it, too, expands globally."" Helena Seiver, Vice President, Strategic Account Management for Micron, Air Liquide

Jiro takes this as his cue to talk us through how Air Liquide’s enScribe™ etching molecules help the company’s electronics customers make marked emissions reductions in their manufacturing processes. “Our materials replace high global warming potential etching gases, which have more potent greenhouse gas emissions than carbon dioxide,” he says. “As such, whenever a customer adopts one of these molecules, it has the potential to reduce the entire sector’s emissions. The use of just one of these molecules by some customers has already helped reduce the industry's overall emissions by almost 1%. “Also,” he adds, “each chip that leaves a fab has the potential to further reduce emissions down the line – by making a computer or even a car more efficient.” Advanced materials indeed! “Micron and Air Liquide have been successfully collaborating for the last 30 years on various projects that have contributed to Micron’s production efficiency, supply chain resiliency and sustainability efforts. We are excited to continue our long partnership with Air Liquide in the years to come.” Jenny Tan, Frontend Global Materials Operations Director, Micron"

Air Liquide nitrogen solution - Australian Mining,"Thu, 06 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5taW5pbmcuY29tLmF1L2Fpci1saXF1aWRlLW5pdHJvZ2VuLXNvbHV0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide’s Floxal Onsite Nitrogen AMSA units have been adopted by Australian and international coal operations.

Air Liquide has been providing its N2 Floxal AMSA solution to underground coal operations for decades, and continues to refine it for the modern mine.

Australian longwall coal mines traditionally used flue gas from boilers or nitrogen from mine shield solutions to control heating events and goaf sealing. These two solutions were used in tandem until a 2002 study by the CSIRO found that nitrogen was just as effective as boiler gases, and the industry moved toward a solely nitrogen-based operation.

In keeping with the trend, Air Liquide developed its Floxal Onsite Nitrogen AMSA units, which have since been adopted by Australian and international longwall coal operations.

“Air Liquide’s N2 Floxal AMSA solution is synonymous with reliability, cost-effectiveness and environmental friendliness,” Air Liquide national and key accounts manager Sajimon Joseph said.

“The fact that Floxal units can produce nitrogen at nine bargs (a unit of gauge pressure) or more helps the goaf sealing with positive pressure in the balance chamber.”

This is a sentiment echoed by Air Liquide national key accounts manager for mining and extraction Rick Edwards.

“It was a first-of-its-kind solution when it was first implemented and we have been refining it ever since,” Edwards told Australian Mining.

“The use of Floxal N2 plants for underground coal mines was only pioneered 15 years ago. The first units were built to supply 500m3 per hour and it became clear that while the solution showed significant promise, higher flow rates were needed.”

Using Air Liquide’s medal polymer hollow fibre gas separation technology, the fact the units produce nitrogen at a pressure of about nine bargs enables the inert gas in the area to be recirculated through the mine.

The medal polymer hollow fibre also allows the air to be circulated over large distances while the unit can stay close to the power source.

“These units are already giving ground-breaking results due to this unique ability to provide previously unavailable large quantities of nitrogen at much higher pressures than has been available from alternative methods and suppliers,” the company said in a statement announcing the range back in 2007.

“In a nutshell, Air Liquide’s innovative mobile systems provide some unique benefits to the mines in terms of safety, reliability and cost-effectiveness.”

The first AMSA unit was delivered to Anglo Coal’s Dartbrook mine in New South Wales in 2007, closely followed by the second unit being delivered to the Austar mine near Cessnock, NSW.

Xstrata Coal took ownership of the third unit that same year and installed it at the Oaky Creek mine in central Queensland.

“We support our customers in their development by offering innovative custom-made solutions, which helps them strengthen their efficiency and safety,” executive vice-president and member of Air Liquide’s executive committee Jean-Pierre Duprieu said at the time.

“Mining has been identified as a growth market in Australia and these important successes in the mining industry with this unique solution illustrate the group’s capacity to grow into new markets and territories.”

Air Liquide has continued to develop its coal mine AMSA solution since 2005, delivering them to coal mines throughout the country.

In 2009, the company signed a contract with Peabody Energy for the delivery of an AMSA 3000 series Floxal at its North Wambo mine in NSW after a six-month trial at the Peabody Bowen Basin mine. A contract with Fitzroy Reources for its Carborough Downs mine in Queensland followed and, in 2010, Whitehaven Coal commissioned Air Liquide to deliver a generator to its Narrabri operation in NSW.

In addition, the Kestrel mine near Emerald in Queensland also made use of a Floxal generator.

Despite the success, Air Liquide has committed itself to continuously redefining the units as the mining sector changes, including customising the units if needed.

Each Floxal unit is built to a standard design, but the company works with the customer to tailor them if needed, working to the specifications of each on-site supply system.

Guaranteeing a convenient, worry-free on-site solution is something that Air Liquide is proud to provide – and its Floxal solutions help it do just that.

“The main benefit of a Floxal is the reliability,” Edwards said.

“This is not only because of the built in redundancy of the equipment, but the fact it is a complete supply solution, backed by trained technicians and experienced local experts.”"
Toward personalized care at home - Air Liquide,"Mon, 24 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvaGVhbHRoY2FyZS90b3dhcmQtcGVyc29uYWxpemVkLWNhcmUtaG9tZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"""My life has changed"", says Margaret Watty, a lively, independent-minded woman who is living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a condition that results in severe breathing difficulty.

Her gratefulness is palpable as we sit together in the warm, sunny living room of her Madrid apartment. “Before, I couldn’t go out – I could hardly walk.” After two bouts with covid-19, she now requires oxygen therapy 24 hours a day. David Rudilla, Air Liquide Healthcare’s Director of Patient Quality of Life and a psychologist, is on-site with us today. He is part of a multidisciplinary team of nurses, technicians, doctors and pharmacists who help patients like Margaret cope with living with a range of chronic conditions. “I am passionate about placing human dignity and quality of life at the center of the support teams provide,” he enthuses. “As we are on the ground interacting with patients throughout their care, we have a global view that takes into account more than just clinical data.” This proximity allows a more comprehensive understanding of each person’s needs, which in turn enables the development of innovative solutions to help them.

“ It makes a huge difference to me to know that the people delivering my follow-up understand my situation. ” Margaret Watty

Carlos Garcia Diaz, Margaret’s VitalAire oxygen technician, is also joining us today. He visits Margaret regularly and the two have developed a close bond. He is always on the lookout for ways to improve her quality of life, and he recently brought her a new oxygen concentrator that better fits her needs. “Originally I had a bigger machine, but Carlos found me this smaller one,” says Margaret with a smile. “I’ll be able to put it in a backpack, so I can be more mobile.” Carlos nods in agreement. “She has to be constantly connected to the machine,” he explains. “These long tubes can be a real impediment when she moves around. But the portable machine allows her to leave her home and be more independent.” Because every patient experiences their illness differently, personalized care plans are more effective than a one-size-fits-all approach. A combination of human presence, digital platforms and data analysis allows Air Liquide Healthcare teams to build a personal profile for every patient and continuously adapt it as the patient’s situation evolves. “It makes a huge difference to know that if I call I can speak to Carlos, and not a machine telling me press 1 if I need this, press 2 if I need that,” says Margaret.

“ My goal is to try to ensure the therapy interferes as little as possible with the patient’s daily life. ” Carlos Garcia Diaz Oxygen technician, VitalAire Spain

To learn more about the impor­tance of value-based healthcare models, we jump in a car with David and head to his office to meet with Federica Bellingeri, Patient Empowerment and Centricity Manager for Air Liquide Healthcare in the Netherlands. “Value-based healthcare is increasingly gaining traction in the health sector,” she tells us. “Payers understand that personalized care plans allow for better targeting of resources and efforts.” David agrees: “The approach improves patient outcomes at the best cost for healthcare systems, which are under unprecedented strain due to rising life expectancy, chronic diseases and treatment costs,” he says. To improve treatment adherence and long-term quality of life, feedback from patients on their needs, expectations and treatment experience is vital. And even their lifestyle enters into the equation. “Patient adherence to therapy is vital, but patients are often dealing with chronic conditions at home,” David points out. “Therapy outcomes rely not only on clinical indicators, but on the barriers or inconveniences of treatment being minimized as much as possible.”

“ We’re creating synergies with stakeholders to ensure that the ultimate treatment goal is the one most meaningful to the patient. ” Federica Bellingeri Patient Empowerment and Centricity Manager, Air Liquide Healthcare

The future of healthcare has to be an ecosystem that puts the patient at the center. Air Liquide Healthcare teams collaborate closely with stakeholders to find ways to advance this goal. “Some payers have adopted an outcome-driven model, with payment linked to therapy adherence or to patient satisfaction, and to innovation that improves patient outcomes,” says Federica. For David, Air Liquide Healthcare is contributing to the development of a virtuous circle: “Doctors benefit from the information we provide. Hospitals that entrust us with their patients’ care at home get better outcomes at the right cost. Patients are empowered because their voices are heard. We receive feedback that makes our solutions more effective. And, ultimately, society benefits from a more sustainable healthcare system.” “My life has returned to almost normal,” says Margaret. And that is the most meaningful outcome of all.

“ Therapy outcomes rely not only on clinical indicators, but on the barriers or inconveniences of treatment being minimized as much as possible. ” David Rudilla Director of Patient Quality of Life, Air Liquide Healthcare

Market segmentation:

End-user

The hospitals segment will account for a significant share of market growth during the forecast period. The rising number of public and private specialty hospitals is expected to drive the growth of this segment during the forecast period. The rising prevalence of diseases, especially among the geriatric population, has increased the demand for medical devices such as hospital ventilators. Technological advances and innovations have improved the reliability of ventilators, which, in turn, has raised their demand in hospitals. These factors will fuel the growth of the hospitals segment during the forecast period.

Product

Critical care ventilators provide support to patients who cannot breathe on their own or need assistance to maintain adequate ventilation. Vendors are introducing advanced portable critical care ventilators, which can be used while shifting patients from one hospital unit to another. Mounted ventilators can be mounted on a patient bed, trolley, table, wall, or ceiling, which provides better visibility and proper monitoring. Thus, growing demand for different types of ventilators is expected to drive the growth of this segment.

Technology

Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is the process of providing oxygen through a face mask without the use of an endotracheal tube. It is beneficial in lowering the overall number of days needed for invasive mechanical ventilation. Positive airway pressure is produced by NIV. As a result, the air is forced into the lungs, reducing the amount of effort required to breathe. Thus, the growing use of mechanical ventilators is expected to drive the growth of the non-invasive segment in the global mechanical ventilators market during the forecast period.

Region

North America is estimated to account for 39% of the growth of the global market during the forecast period. The incidence of several chronic diseases, such as heart disease and cancer, has increased significantly in the region. This, in turn, has increased the number of patients admitted to intensive care units. Intensive care ventilators provide temporary ventilatory or breathing assistance to patients who cannot breathe on their own. These factors are anticipated to drive the growth of the ventilator market in North America during the forecast period.

Medical oxygen: gas companies must shore up supply - report - The Observer,"Tue, 18 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vb2JzZXJ2ZXIudWcvbmV3cy9oZWFkbGluZXMvNzc0NzItbWVkaWNhbC1veHlnZW4tZ2FzLWNvbXBhbmllcy1tdXN0LXNob3JlLXVwLXN1cHBseS1yZXBvcnTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Although the COVID-19 pandemic reemphasized the essentiality of medical liquid oxygen (medical LOX) in healthcare systems, a new report by Access to Medicine Foundation indicates that low and middle-income countries are still facing supply shortages.

Access to Medicine Foundation is an independent non-profit organisation that seeks to transform the healthcare ecosystem by motivating and mobilising companies to expand access to their essential healthcare products tracked down initiatives taken by six global companies to increase access and supply of medical LOX both during health emergencies and daily health needs, especially in low and middle-income countries.

The gas companies under review are; Air Liquide, Air Products, Linde, Messer, Nippon Sanso Holdings Corporation and SOL Group which produce medical oxygen via cryogenic fractional distillation at cryogenic air separation units (ASUs) including distribution in cylinders.

In the report, Access to Medicine Foundation notes that historically, the production of medical LOX has never been a core business of gas companies, but given the essential nature of the product for lifesaving treatment such as pneumonia and tuberculosis and daily medical procedures during surgery and childbirth gas companies must urgently harness and expand production of medical LOX.

Although medical LOX high-profile use was more pronounced during the 2-year COVID-19 pandemic, medical oxygen is also essential in the critical treatment of other communicable conditions such as pneumonia, malaria and tuberculosis and non-communicable diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and heart disease.

OXYGEN HAS NO SUBSTITUTE

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines medical oxygen as “lifesaving and an essential medicine used to ensure safe surgical, emergency and critical care services. It is used at all levels of the healthcare system and is crucial for the treatment of COVID-19 and other life-threatening conditions such as severe pneumonia, severe malaria, sepsis caused by a wide variety of pathogens, trauma and complications of pregnancy or birth. Unlike many medicines, it has no substitute.”

The report further notes that deliberate efforts to increase supply in low and middle-income companies have been reported in only 39 of 108 countries.

It is estimated half of healthcare facilities in Africa do not have reliable access to essential oxygen with weak weak oxygen infrastructure, fragmented supply chains, transport challenges, and unreliable energy resources for production among the challenges cited, and where it is available it is often unaffordable.

Furthermore, Access to Medicine Foundation says because patients and health systems do not necessarily ‘demand’ a drug or commodity which has never been available in their setting, it makes it difficult for gas companies and policymakers to quantify the potential opportunity.

“With a small number of companies responsible for the world’s supply of medical liquid oxygen, the role they play in the global health ecosystem needs to be prioritised. Medical gases are a small part of these companies’ business, yet society needs them to ensure this vital lifeline is available both during emergencies and to meet the daily medical oxygen needs of all health systems,” said AMF CEO, Jayasree K. Iyer."
Delivering the world’s glass with less gas - Air Liquide,"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvc3VzdGFpbmFiaWxpdHkvZGVsaXZlcmluZy13b3JsZHMtZ2xhc3MtbGVzcy1nYXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Entering the meeting room at the Verallia glass plant in Pescia, Italy, the first thing one notices is all the bottles of water in the middle of the table.

Luckily, we don’t have to wait long until our host, Andrea Cendron, Technical Director at Verallia Italy, gestures toward them: “Please, help yourselves,” he says, adding with a chuckle, “We’re not running short.” That’s certainly true: with 34 plants producing more than 16 billion glass containers every year, Verallia is the world’s third largest manufacturer of bottles and jars for beverages and foodstuffs. And after the tour – especially the brief stop by the furnace – we’re thirsty. “Glass is made by melting a mixture of silica, contained in sand, or indeed recycled glass – and this requires temperatures of around 1,500°C,” Andrea explains. By way of comparison, gold melts at just over 1,000°C; lead is already liquid at 300°C. “Our produc­tion process is highly energy intensive, so our main challenge is to lower our carbon emissions.”

“ Our new-generation on-site oxygen production unit is more efficient than current systems. It lowers both energy consumption and related carbon emissions. ” Benjamin Coiffier On-Site Innovation Program Manager, Industrial Merchant activity at Air Liquide

“This is where Air Liquide can help,” says Alessandro Pallotti, Key Account and Business Development Manager at Air Liquide Italy. “In late 2021, Verallia announced ambitious sustainability objectives, and we were able to respond with a proposal specifically tailored to the glass market. Here in Pescia, we will be combining our new next-generation, on-site oxygen production unit, which will be 10% more energy efficient than the previous generation, with our HeatOxTM technology, which will recover wasted heat from furnaces to save up to 20% of the energy needed for the glass melting process. The result: an 18% reduction in CO 2 emissions. The solution will also deliver an up to 90% reduction in nitric oxide emissions, which in high concentrations can be harmful to health.”

His colleague, Benjamin Coiffier, On-Site Innovation Program Manager at Air Liquide Industrial Merchant activity, explains the details. “Let’s start with oxygen: furnaces are heated by burning natural gas with air. If pure oxygen is used instead of air (this is called oxy-combustion), then nitrogen and nitric oxide emissions are removed from the process and efficiency is higher.”

He continues, “Now, separating oxygen from air also requires energy, but our new on-site oxygen production units are more efficient than current systems, which lowers both our energy consumption and related carbon emissions; they also produce purer oxygen, further reducing nitric oxide emissions.”

“ We will be combining our new-generation, on-site oxygen production unit with our HeatOxTM heat recovery system to deliver energy savings of up to 20%. ” Alessandro Pallotti Key Account and Business Development Manager at Air Liquide Italy

“Then, there is HeatOxTM, our proprietary technology that harnesses the high-temperature fumes emitted by the furnace to preheat the natural gas and oxygen fed into it. They must be at about 500°C on entering the furnace. Thanks to heat recovery, less energy is needed to bring them up to temperature,” Alessandro further explains. According to Andrea, these technologies are real game changers: “By introducing pure oxygen as an oxidizer in our production process, and using HeatOxTM to recover the flue gas heat, we will vastly improve our performance regarding specific emissions compared to a conventional furnace.” Air Liquide’s twin oxy-combustion and heat recuperator solution is scheduled to go into service in Pescia at the beginning of January 2024, and preparations are already well underway. “For us as glass producers, long-term planning and continuity of supply are absolutely essential,” explains Andrea. “Once we commission a new furnace, it will be in continuous operation – day and night – for its entire service life, which is around 15 years. If we ever had to switch it off, recommissioning would be difficult.”

“Here, our new-generation, on-site oxygen production unit offers another advantage,” says Benjamin. “Our unique cryogenic system is more reliable than pressure-swing absorption. It's also more compact.” Alessandro nods: “And just in case there are any teething difficulties, we have contingency plans to deliver oxygen by truck. Continuity of supply is guaranteed at Air Liquide.”

“We have built up strong working relationships at all levels,” says Andrea, “and we know that Air Liquide is a trusted partner with whom we can explore future solutions to our challenge of reducing our emissions.” Air Liquide’s support of Verallia’s sustainability goals in Italy is only the beginning. In Brazil, too, the Group is working with Verallia to upgrade its furnaces. As an important step toward making glass manufacturing carbon neutral, Air Liquide has completed preliminary tests with another partner to replace natural gas with hydrogen. “But before we start talking about H 2 ,” Andrea jokes, “can I offer anyone some more H 2 O?”

“ We know that Air Liquide is a trusted partner with whom we can explore future solutions to our challenge of reducing our emissions. ” Andrea Cendron Technical Director at Verallia Italy"
Reducing CO₂ emissions at the world’s largest oxygen plant - Air Liquide,"Thu, 20 Apr 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvc3VzdGFpbmFiaWxpdHkvcmVkdWNpbmctY28yLWVtaXNzaW9ucy13b3JsZHMtbGFyZ2VzdC1veHlnZW4tcGxhbnTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“In a way, these units are coming back home,” says Jens Juckel, gesturing toward a line of seven rectangular towers rising from a mesh of ground-level piping. But, of course, these air separation units (ASU) located in Secunda, in South Africa’s Mpumalanga Province, aren’t going anywhere.

As we head east across the expansive site to look at another row, Jens, Senior Process and Efficiency Expert at Air Liquide Large Industries South Africa, explains: “Air Liquide was commissioned by Sasol to build these ASUs in 1979.” Here, South Africa’s largest energy and chemical producer operates a two-mile-wide site that boasts the world’s highest oxygen production capacity.

The oxygen produced on-site is mainly used to produce synthesis fuel and chemicals. Following a 480 million euro deal in summer 2021, the oxygen plant is now owned by Air Liquide. “We will be operating all 16 ASUs for the next 15 years, in addition to the unit we already operate today,” says Jens, “and since we built them, it feels like we are coming full circle.” The deal is a key step in the long-term relationship that the Group has had with Sasol for the past 40 years. Not only is Air Liquide operating the whole oxygen production plant, but it is also modernizing the units. In addition to bringing benefits in terms of safety, reliability and efficiency, the solution provided by Air Liquide will help reduce the amount of CO 2 emitted during oxygen production. “We are aiming to cut emissions of the acquired assets in Secunda by 30% to 40% by 2031,” explains Jens. “The most obvious option is to use renewable energy.” Indeed, Air Liquide and Sasol have signed power purchase agreements for the long-term supply of 480 MW of renewable energy. Ultimately, the goal is to procure a total capacity of 900 MW of renewable-generated power for the site.

“ We apply digitalization to make maintenance more effective. ” Lizelle Meyer Operations Excellence Manager, Air Liquide

Other key contributions to reducing CO 2 emissions include improvements in process efficiency and the introduction of a new operating philosophy for the acquired assets. “We have identified and started work on a number of efficiency projects from which we are already seeing significant savings,” says Jens. And then there are what he calls “the quick wins”: running existing units more efficiently. At the eastern set of ASUs, Operations Excellence Manager Lizelle Meyer talks us through them. “Under Sasol, safety and reliability were paramount, as they are to Air Liquide. But we now have a third primary focus as well: energy efficiency, which we are pursuing through advanced process control optimization strategies.” Air Liquide is also working with the Sasol teams to identify and execute further opportunities for site decarbonization. According to Simon Baloyi, Sasol Executive Vice President, Energy Operations and Technology, the shared ambition to decarbonize operations in Secunda is what makes the partnership with Air Liquide successful. “By improving the energy efficiency of our operations and assets, we will reduce steam usage, which will directly result in less carbon dioxide emissions.”

“ The partnership between Air Liquide and Sasol is anchored in open, honest and transparent collaboration. ” Simon Baloyi Sasol Executive Vice President, Energy Operations and Technology

“Then there is increased reliability and safety, which has a direct impact on efficiency. Air Liquide uses digitalization to make maintenance more effective,” explains Lizelle, introducing us to Cyril Sebei, Mechanical Area Manager, who is responsible for a maintenance team. “With our extensive cold boxes maintenance program, for example,” explains the engineer, “we are not only ensuring safety, but increasing efficiency.” “Air Liquide has brought a new operational strategy to the acquired Secunda assets,” Cyril continues. “We now work with Sasol to forecast demand and reduce capacity whenever possible.” He gestures over to the hulking Sasol cooling towers. “For some employees, the acquisition was worrying at first. As it turned out, though, Air Liquide has brought global expertise in industrial gases. It’s been very positive for the atmosphere.” Adds Jens with a chuckle: “In both senses of the term!”

“ Air Liquide has brought us global expertise. It’s been very positive for the atmosphere. ” Cyril Sebei Mechanical Area Manager, Air Liquide"

The global Biomass Gasification Market was valued at $88.0 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach $188.5 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 8% from 2022 to 2030.Biomass is organic matter that is obtained from plants and animals. It is a renewable source that can be used for generating energy. It is capable of providing energy in form of heat as well as electricity upon burning and later turning the heat into electricity. Gasification is a process in which organic and fossil fuels are converted into gases. It is carried out through a controlled amount of oxygen and steam without any combustion. This process is carried out at high temperatures without allowing the matter to burn or combust. Biomass gasification is a process where biomass obtained from organic matter is converted into gases such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide in a controlled environment. This process is carried out through different gasifiers. Carbon monoxide hence produced reacts with water in a water-gas shift reaction and produces more hydrogen and carbon dioxide from which hydrogen is further used as fuel.""Global Biomass Gasification Market Size, Share, Trends, by Type, by Application and Region, Forecast to 2030"" to its product and service offerings.
