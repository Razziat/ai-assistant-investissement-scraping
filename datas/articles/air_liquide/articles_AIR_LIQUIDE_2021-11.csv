Collective intelligence for deep tech solutions - Air Liquide,"Mon, 15 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvZGVlcC10ZWNoL2NvbGxlY3RpdmUtaW50ZWxsaWdlbmNlLWRlZXAtdGVjaC1zb2x1dGlvbnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Climate change, chronic diseases, cybersecurity – sometimes, the magnitude of the challenges facing society can feel dizzying. Yet the technology for responding to these trends is not beyond our reach – quite to the contrary. Air Liquide is one of the companies developing deep tech solutions¹ to tackle them, through a cooperative approach to innovation that will be the key to its success.

As industries around the world have grown ever more interconnected due to globalization, innovation silos will simply no longer cut it. The technological advancements of the future are defined by one theme: collaboration. “Experience teaches us that innovation is always first and foremost a matter of people, connections and analogies,” says Chairman and CEO Benoît Potier. “Gone are the days when a firm could retain control over its entire R&D efforts… From now on, innovation will take place in an open ecosystem.” With a network of Campuses in Europe, North America and Asia, Air Liquide has created a flourishing ecosystem of collective intelligence focused on developing and manufacturing disruptive business solutions. “We will see exciting new technologies from our ecosystem in real-world use in the near future,” says Luc Gaffet, Fusion and Big Market Science Director, Global Markets & Technologies.

Cryogenics: ultra-low temperatures, sky-high potential

One example of a company on the verge of bringing new technology to market is Cryoconcept, in which Air Liquide took an 80% stake in 2020. Over the past two decades, the company has developed a dilution refrigeration solution for getting close to absolute zero (that is -273.14°C, or 0.01°K), a necessity for advancing quantum computing capabilities and scientific research.







“By 2030, I expect quantum computers to be carrying out calculations currently beyond our grasp. This will lead to exceptionally powerful algorithms which can work at split-second speed – fast enough for an autonomous car to drive safely,” says Luc Gaffet.

Guillaume Desaché, Cryoconcept’s Managing Director, agrees, citing steering traffic on the ground, the automated development of new medicines and cybersecurity as near-future applications. ""To go beyond research use and into industrial or safety-critical applications, our products need higher reliability and better availability, as well as an overall improvement to their current cooling power,” he says. “With over sixty years experience in both extreme cryogenics and production at scale, Air Liquide is the ideal partner."" ""It’s a win-win collaboration,” replies Luc Gaffet, ""because Cryoconcept helps us to enlarge our offer to include extremely low temperatures. Also, their technology uses helium 3 and helium 42, two very rare molecules, which we supply to our customers.""

Helium recovery systems for imaging scanners The Group worked in close coordination with United Imaging’s teams to design a turnkey helium solution that greatly increases the recovery rate of helium and further guarantees the stable supply of liquid helium. This helium is used by United Imaging in MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging) and PETMR (Positron emission tomography - magnetic resonance imaging) scanners to keep internal temperatures low and ensure the proper functioning of the machines. ""Air Liquide provides innovative solutions based on continuously updated technology, enabling us to provide customized services to our customers,"" says LV Yunlei.

Developing a low-cost energy storage solution

Another mutually-beneficial relationship with an ecosystem partner can be found at the Air Liquide Paris Innovation Campus. As a participant in Air Liquide’s Accelair deep tech accelerator, energy storage start-up Airthium benefits from office and lab space with on-hand expertise.







“We are currently prototyping our seasonal battery to try and scale it up to the kilowatt stage,” says founder, CEO and CTO Andreï Klochko, ""and having people we can ask for advice on building machinery to run at high temperatures and under pressure is invaluable.""







Deployed at scale, Airthium’s ammonia-based energy storage solution promises to provide a low-cost way of storing excess solar and wind energy over months or even years. It will make renewable energy production and storage a sustainable replacement of coal and gas power plants.

""As well as the potential for participating in the energy transition market further down the line, in the nearer term, we will be able to offer Air Liquide a solution for guaranteeing renewable energy supplies for its own operations,"" Klochko adds.







Air Liquide’s intention to be behind many of the pioneering technologies of the future requires the Group to collaborate with the right partners. By leveraging collective intelligence across industries and partners, the company has already succeeded in creating a global ecosystem of truly open innovation. The key to future success? Expanding this network to support the development of as many deep tech technologies as possible, leading to the opening of new markets and the dawning of new technological frontiers.

Deep tech innovation at Air Liquide







Air Liquide is a key player in deep tech, offering innovative, high-tech solutions through its Global Markets and Technologies (GM&T) Business Unit, in the sectors of aerospace, space and extreme cryogenics for scientific research. The Group has recently inaugurated its Campus Technologies Grenoble (France), dedicated to the design and production of technologies for the deep tech and energy transition (hydrogen and biomethane) markets, and supports many deep tech start-ups through its Accelair accelerator, housed at the Paris Innovation Campus."
Webinar: Landfill Gas Treatment Technologies | US EPA - U.S. EPA.gov,"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVwYS5nb3YvbG1vcC93ZWJpbmFyLWxhbmRmaWxsLWdhcy10cmVhdG1lbnQtdGVjaG5vbG9naWVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On November 16, 2021, LMOP hosted a webinar with three speakers providing information about the treatment of landfill gas (LFG) for energy recovery projects. Removing impurities from LFG can be costly and complicated—learn how two LMOP Partners are improving LFG treatment by making it easier to remove nitrogen (N 2 ) and hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S).

The presentations were followed by a question-and-answer session. The presentation slides are provided below in a PDF file as well as a recording of the webinar.

Designing an LFG-to-renewable natural gas (RNG) upgrading plant involves numerous site-specific variables, particularly raw LFG flow and composition. An elevated N 2 concentration can present challenges for meeting natural gas pipeline specifications and require enhanced management of the LFG collection, or specific treatment to remove N 2 . Air Liquide developed a Nitrogen Rejection Unit (NRU) system to effectively process feed N 2 concentrations up to 12 percent N 2 (optimum range of 5-7 percent) in the raw LFG feed gas while achieving 96 percent methane recovery in the product RNG. Upgraded biogas is compressed, cooled and then treated through a cascaded 3-stage process. Other than the feed compression and a modulating quality control valve, the system does not have any moving parts, which results in simple operation. Air Liquide installed this membrane NRU at two sites in 2019-2020 with an additional four installations planned for 2021-2022. The simplicity, high methane recovery and lower energy consumption of the Air Liquide NRU package can be beneficial to landfills that need to address N 2 concentrations.

Mixed metal oxy-hydroxide (MMO) is a new, field-proven dry media technology from Guild Associates for the removal of H 2 S from LFG. Unlike conventional dry media types, which contain both active and inactive components, MMO contains 100 percent active component, providing maximum concentration of active sites and H 2 S removal capacity. In a case study that Guild Associates presented during this webinar, MMO media was used to replace a conventional media type at a landfill in Texas. The enhanced media efficiency allowed the landfill to process 15 percent more gas (up to 6,500 standard cubic feet per minute) and extended the media change-out interval by a factor of five, from three to 15 weeks. As a result, operational costs were reduced by 80 percent and revenue increased.

Air Liquide (Paris:AI) and BASF are planning to develop the world’s largest cross-border Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) value chain. The goal is to significantly reduce CO 2 emissions at the industrial cluster in the port of Antwerp. The joint project “Kairos@C” has been selected for funding by the European Commission through its Innovation Fund, as one of the seven large-scale projects out of more than 300 applications.

Kairos@C will be jointly developed by Air Liquide and BASF at its Antwerp chemical site. By avoiding 14.2 million tons of CO 2 over the first 10 years of operation, it will significantly contribute to the EU’s goal of becoming climate neutral by 2050.

Besides combining CO 2 capture, liquefaction, transportation and storage on a large scale in the North Sea, the project includes several innovative technologies. Notably, for capturing the CO 2 from production plants, Air Liquide will use its patented CryocapTM technology and, for drying the CO 2 , BASF will apply its Sorbead® solution. The project is planned to be operational in 2025.

Kairos@C is paving the way for the next phases of carbon abatement in the port of Antwerp. The project will also be connected to shared CO 2 transport and export infrastructures, including a first-of-its-kind CO 2 liquefaction and export terminal, which will be built under the framework of “Antwerp@C”, a consortium that aims to halve CO 2 emissions in the port of Antwerp by 2030. Air Liquide and BASF are founding members of Antwerp@C.

Benoît Potier, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Air Liquide, declared: “In line with its sustainability objectives, which include reaching carbon neutrality by 2050, Air Liquide’s ambition is to contribute actively to the emergence of a low carbon society. Energy transition requires tackling complex projects and joining forces of both public and private sectors to make these projects a reality. We are very pleased that the Kairos@C project has been selected by the Innovation Fund and it will contribute towards the EU climate goals, thanks in particular to some innovative Air Liquide technologies. Air Liquide and BASF have been engaged in a strategic partnership in the port of Antwerp for over 50 years and this groundbreaking project opens a new chapter of our cooperation towards developing a more sustainable industry.”

Dr. Martin Brudermüller, Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors of BASF SE says: “BASF wants to reduce its CO 2 emissions by 25% by 2030 compared with 2018 and achieve net zero CO 2 emissions by 2050. To reach these ambitious goals, we must use all available technologies. Especially for BASF’s Verbund site in Antwerp, due to its prime location in the Port of Antwerp with direct sea access, CCS is an attractive solution to reduce CO 2 emissions from production processes on an industrial scale within a relatively short timeframe. Therefore, Kairos@C can become another important step on our path to climate neutrality.”

The European Innovation Fund is one of the world’s largest programs for promoting innovative low-carbon technologies. Receiving this funding is an essential milestone in making a final investment decision and starting the execution of this project.

The unnamed facility – being developed by a consortium consisting of Norwegian renewable energy producer Scatec, Abu Dhabi-based fertiliser producer Fertiglobe, the Sovereign Fund of Egypt and Cairo-based engineering and construction contractor Orascom – is due to be completed before the country hosts COP27 at the resort of Sharm El-Sheikh in November 2022.

US-based Plug Power will supply the 100MW polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyser to the project, which is due to produce 90,000 tonnes of green ammonia per year at chemical company Egyptian Basic Industries Corporation’s existing ammonia plant in Ain Sokhna, a coastal town on the Gulf of Suez.

“At start-up, this will be the largest green hydrogen and largest green ammonia application globally,” said Nassef Sawiris, executive chairman of OCI, which owns 58% of Fertiglobe, with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc) owning the remainder.

“Construction is expected to follow an accelerated schedule to showcase the green hydrogen facility during COP 27 in Egypt in November 2022, highlighting Egypt’s and Fertiglobe’s growing leadership in the renewable energy markets and commitment to a greener future.”

A press release from the consortium stated that: “Egypt is an ideal location to produce green hydrogen given its unique renewables profile with strong solar and wind loads, and proximity to markets with a hydrogen deficit.”

The power for the electrolyser will come from the grid, backed by renewable energy certificates to ensure it is green, a Scatec spokesman tells Recharge.

The world’s largest green hydrogen project is currently Air Liquide’s 20MW Bécancour facility in Quebec, Canada, which uses a PEM electrolyser supplied by US-based Cummins and is powered by local hydroelectricity.

More than 250GW of green hydrogen projects have been announced worldwide, many of which are larger than 1GW, but are not expected to be built until the middle or later part of this decade."

The capital comes in from Air Water, MUFG Bank, Ltd. (MUFG), Nikkiso, and Japan Infrastructure Initiate (JII) as FirstElement Fuel is actively executing on its plan to build out its California Hydrogen Network from 31 True Zero Stations to 80 stations by 2024. At least 12 of the 80 stations will be capable of refueling heavy-duty trucks in addition to light-duty cars.

“It’s very encouraging to have partners like these who share our vision of what can be accomplished when we build a network of hydrogen stations,” said Joel Ewanick, Founder and CEO of FirstElement Fuel Inc. “The whole team at FirstElement is very appreciative of all the financial support we are getting so that we can continue to build our vision of a hydrogen network that serves cars and heavy-duty trucks as well as expand from 31 stations to at least 80 over the next few years.”

MUFG, Air Water, Nikkiso, and JII will join Mitsui, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and Air Liquide as investors in FirstElement. Additionally, FirstElement has received over $125 Million in public funding from the California Energy Commission, the South Coast AQMD, and the Bay Area AQMD.

Background

FirstElement opened its first hydrogen station in December of 2015 and since then the company has led the development of stations in California, opening the largest number of stations in the State as well as the largest capacity refueling stations in the world. The Series D funding is the largest round of private capital raised by FirstElement Fuel thus far and was brought in shortly after the California Air Resources Board and California Energy Commission implemented policies designed to encourage private investment to play a more significant role in developing California’s Hydrogen Refueling Infrastructure.

FirstElement is unique in offering the largest network of hydrogen stations in the world supplied by Liquid Hydrogen rather than gaseous. Liquid hydrogen distribution and storage is far more efficient, which is helping drive down the cost of hydrogen at the dispenser by 25%.

In just six years FirstElement Fuel has dispensed enough hydrogen into fuel cell electric cars to drive over 170 million zero emission miles, and has avoided more than 110 million pounds of CO2. It’s only the beginning as FirstElement’s 31 stations, all in California so far, have been regularly breaking single day, and 7-day records."
