"Air Liquide Combined Shareholders' Meeting of May 3, 2023 - Air Liquide","Wed, 03 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL2dyb3VwL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzLW5ld3MvMjAyMy0wNS0wMy9haXItbGlxdWlkZS1jb21iaW5lZC1zaGFyZWhvbGRlcnMtbWVldGluZy1tYXktMy0yMDIz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Shareholders’ Meeting of Air Liquide, chaired by Benoît Potier, Chairman of the Board of Directors, in the presence of François Jackow, Chief Executive Officer, the members of the Board of Directors, and of Jérôme Pelletan, Chief Financial Officer, was attended by 2,692 people on Wednesday, May 3, 2023, at the Palais des Congrès in Paris, France. The Shareholders, who represented 58.27% of the voting rights, i.e. 81,563 Shareholders present or represented, approved all of the resolutions that were submitted.

Benoît Potier, Chairman of the Board, opened, alongside the Members of the Board, Air Liquide’s General Meeting, which had for theme this year ""Inventing The Future Today"". Presenting the performance of the Group, Jérôme Pelletan, Chief Financial Officer, highlighted the acceleration of its growth and its commitment to ESG, and more generally the quality of its financial as well as extra-financial results. Benoît Potier then presented the strategic background in which the Group evolved last year and reviewed the global context and its implications for Air Liquide. François Jackow, Chief Executive Officer, proceeded by detailing the strategy, the environmental and societal progress as well as Air Liquide’s perspectives for 2023. Benoît Potier presented the elements related to governance, in particular the proposed new composition of the Board of Directors and its committees, as well as the work completed in 2022. Xavier Huillard, Lead Director, reviewed the compensation of corporate officers in his capacity as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. The Statutory Auditors continued with a summary of their reports.

More than 50 minutes of discussion followed with the audience and the meeting was concluded by the votes on the 23 resolutions.

The proposed dividend, with an ex-date of May 15 and a payment date of May 17, 2023, was approved: it will be 2.95 euros per share and 3.24 euros per share eligible for the loyalty bonus.

The Shareholders’ Meeting appointed Catherine Guillouard, Christina Law, Alexis Perakis-Valat and Michael H. Thaman as Directors for a term of four years. As the terms of office of Siân Herbert-Jones and Geneviève Berger expired at the close of the Meeting, the Board renewed its warm thanks to them. The General Meeting also ratified the co-option of Monica de Virgiliis by the Board of Directors on February 15, 2023, in replacement of Anette Bronder, for the remainder of the latter's term of office, i.e. until the close of the 2024 General Meeting. All the new members have joined the Board as independent Directors.

The Board of Directors is thus composed of 14 members: 12 members elected by the Shareholders, very largely independent (83% of independent Directors) out of which 5 women (42% of the Board) and 5 Directors of foreign nationality, and 2 Directors representing the employees. The composition of the Board offers a diversity of profiles, experiences, skills, nationalities and cultures, adapted to the Group’s challenges. It reflects the diversity policy implemented by the Board of Directors.

In addition, the Shareholders’s Meeting voted in favor of the resolution concerning the 2022 remuneration of:

Benoît Potier, as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer from January 1, 2022, to May 31, 2022,

François Jackow, as Chief Executive Officer from June 1, 2022, to December 31, 2022,

Benoît Potier, as Chairman of the Board of Directors from June 1, 2022, to December 31, 2022,

as well as information on the compensation of all Corporate Officers for 2022.

The Shareholders’ Meeting also approved the remuneration policy of the Corporate Officers related to:

François Jackow, as Chief Executive Officer,

Benoît Potier, as Chairman of the Board of Directors,

and to the non-executive Directors.

Lastly, on the recommendation of the Appointments and Governance Committee, the Board of Directors, held today, determined the composition of the Committees as follows:

Audit and Accounts Committee: Catherine Guillouard (Chairwoman), Aiman Ezzat, Bertrand Dumazy,

Appointments and Governance Committee: Xavier Huillard (Chairman), Annette Winkler, Bertrand Dumazy,

Remuneration Committee: Xavier Huillard (Chairman), Kim Ann Mink, Fatima Tighlaline (Director representing the employees),

(WCJB) - Officials with the company “Air Liquide” (“Lih-keed”) say nothing hazardous is in the air around High Springs and only one worker remains in the hospital this evening.

Three of the four people hurt in the explosion have been released from the hospital.

The facility is now safely shut down and according to the state department of environmental protection there was "" no environmental release.”

They say there is no threat to the public.

The High Springs facility makes a specialty gas used to create computer chips.

High Springs firefighters responded to an explosion at Air Liquide, 17526 High Springs Main St. around 4 a.m. Crews were able to put out the fire and are working to mitigate potential hazards at the site.

One of the people injured in the explosion was airlifted and is in critical condition according to High Springs officials. The other three patients were taken to the hospital.

Company officials say the Florida Department of Environmental Protection determined no environmental release has been identified and there is no known public safety concern.

A nearby resident says he was walking his dog Thursday morning when he heard a loud noise.

“I live out in the woods so we thought maybe it was a huge tree that fell down, but it didn’t sound like a tree falling down and it shook the earth.” said resident Peter George. “I mean it felt like an earthquake.”

Air Liquide provided TV20 with the following statement on the incident:

“On Thursday, May 4, 2023, at approximately 4 a.m., an explosion occurred at the Air Liquide Advanced Materials Inc. facility in High Springs, Florida. The incident caused injuries to 4 employees on site who were transferred to the local hospital. Three of the employees have been released following evaluation by medical personnel. Air Liquide extends its most sincere concern and support to its employees and their families. The facility instituted its emergency response plan and is being supported by the Gainesville Fire Department, Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and local police. The facility has been evacuated and safely shut down. Emergency responders are currently onsite, and the site is now considered stable by the Gainesville Fire Department. At this time, per the Florida DEP, no environmental release has been identified, and there is no known general public safety concern. We are fully committed to the safety and welfare of our employees and our community. We are actively collaborating with the authorities to investigate the cause and circumstances of the incident.""

Air Liquide And Holcim To Jointly Work On Cement Decarbonization In Belgium - Carbon Herald,"Tue, 02 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYm9uaGVyYWxkLmNvbS9haXItbGlxdWlkZS1hbmQtaG9sY2ltLXRvLWpvaW50bHktd29yay1vbi1jZW1lbnQtZGVjYXJib25pemF0aW9uLWluLWJlbGdpdW0v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide and Holcim have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to collaborate on a project to decarbonize Holcim’s cement production site, which is currently under development in Obourg, Belgium.

The project will use Air Liquide’s patent CryocapTM CO2 capture technology. As part of the project, the two companies have jointly applied for the European Innovation Fund framework.

For the upcoming cement production facility, which will replace an existing asset, Air Liquide’s carbon capture technology will be able to bring down emissions by as much as 1.1 million tons of carbon dioxide annually. The new partnership is part of Holcim’s investment program GO4Zero which aims to allow the building materials company to achieve CO2 neutrality in Belgium by 2030.

Air Liquide will support this goal by offering its expertise and proprietary technology in carbon capture. The industrial gases company plans to build and operate a unit of its CryocapTM Oxy technology with the aim to capture and purify up to 95% of the carbon generated from Holcim’s production unit. The captured carbon will be handled through Antwerp@C CO2 Export Hub and will then be transported, liquefied, and loaded onto carbon-carrying vessels for offshore storage permanently.

Air Liquide and Holcim plan to implement the project with the help of public EU funding.

Air Liquide’s proprietary CryocapTM technology is particularly well suited to decarbonize the cement industry,” said Pascal Vinet, Senior Vice President and Executive Committee Member of the Air Liquide Group, supervising Europe Industries. “This collaboration with Holcim illustrates our ability to work with our customers to significantly reduce their CO2 footprint and make the decarbonization of the industry a reality.”

Earlier in the week, Nike introduced the H2 Barge 1 at its European Logistics Campus in Laakdal, Belgium. As part of its journey toward a zero carbon and zero waste future, Nike is partnering with Future Proof Shipping (FPS) and BCTN Network of Inland Terminals, to accelerate zero-emission shipping.

Future Proof Shipping’s zero-emissions 110m x 11.45m inland containership, H2 Barge 1 is chartered by BCTN on behalf of Nike EMEA. The vessel, expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2000 tonnes of CO2e per year, will sail between Rotterdam and BCTN’s inland terminal in Meerhout several times a week.

Minister of Infrastructure & Water Management in the Netherlands, Mark Harbers, was in attendance for the official launch to present FPS Founder, Huib van de Grijspaarde, with a special A-Zero (A0) emission label awarded only to zero-emission vessels.

During the presentation of the label, Minister Mark Harbers said, “It’s my pleasure to present the very first A-Zero emission label to H2 Barge1, as it is the first vessel to truly qualify as zero emission. An achievement worth applauding. I hope this achievement by Future Proof Shipping will persuade other shipowners to make the transition to emission free transport too, and that many more A-Zero emission labels will be handed out in the future.”

Also present were the FPS team and various partner representatives from Air Liquide, BCTN Network of Inland Terminals, Holland Shipyards Group, Koedood Marine Group, Kooiman Marine Group, Nedstack Fuel Cell Technology, Rabobank, and Nike.

“We have been working for a couple of years now to ensure we tread more lightly on the planet. This shipping project proves that moving cargo with zero-emissions and zero impact is possible, and we hope it accelerates the industry to follow in Nike’s footsteps and move to zero. I would like to thank our dedicated FPS team, our founder Huib van de Grijspaarde for his unwavering belief in us and the project and all our trusted partners for enabling us to see it through. This is a pivotal moment, not just for Future Proof Shipping but for the future of shipping.” Richard Klatten, CEO – Future Proof Shipping.

“Nike’s ultimate goal is to create a zero carbon, zero waste future. We’ve been on this journey for decades, and we’re setting even bolder goals for the future. The H2 Barge 1 is an important example of how we are investing in sustainable progress across logistics and transportation to protect the environment for future generations.” Eb Mukhtar, Vice President Operations & Logistics – Nike EMEA

“Green and blue are our colours: we navigate the inland waterways and respect nature. We wish to be the preferred inland operator of our customers. Sustainability is part of our DNA, and together with the right partners, we are building a zero-emission future.” David Huybrechts, General Manager Belgium – BCTN

A Chicken and Egg Problem: How Germany's Hydrogen Boom Stalled - DER SPIEGEL International Edition,"Thu, 11 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zcGllZ2VsLmRlL2ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwvYnVzaW5lc3MvYS1jaGlja2VuLWFuZC1lZ2ctcHJvYmxlbS1ob3ctZ2VybWFueS1zLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLWJvb20tc3RhbGxlZC1hLTM2NGQ1NTcxLWQwNTMtNGU4Yy04YTUzLTY2ZDIzZmVlYTJhONIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"One person who holds a similar view is Jens Geier, the head of the center-left German Social Democratic Party (SPD's) party group in the European Parliament. The gas industry will have to change, says Geier, who is leading negotiations on the regulation for the European Parliament. ""That's why it should also take responsibility for the development of the hydrogen networks,"" he says. ""This is important for the timely supply of energy-intensive industry.""

In February, members of the European Parliament decided that distribution network operators controlled by municipal authorities should be permitted to transport hydrogen without major restrictions. It was a victory for the gas industry, but only a temporary one. That's because the European Council, which represents the member states, still has to approve the regulation, and it remains controversial there. France, for example, couldn't care less about preserving the German gas network. The government in Paris wants to protect its own electricity sector. In a country with 57 nuclear power plants, electricity had traditionally been more important than gas for energy supply. If Paris had its way, nuclear power would flow directly to electrolyzers located near the factories, eliminating the need for any large hydrogen pipelines.

The gas lobby fears that consensus for that opinion could also develop in Germany. The reason behind that is a recently published paper by the think tank Agora Energiewende, which had been headed for years by Patrick Graichen, the state secretary responsible for the issue at the Economics Ministry, which is led by the Green Party. The Agora study sees no future for more than 90 percent of gas distribution networks in Germany. Instead, it states, the ""orderly and timely decommissioning"" is a central task of the transition away from natural gas to other technologies for heating.

If, on the other hand, the phase-out were postponed, it would lead to the stranding of up to 10 billion euros in assets. In the end, these costs would be borne by consumers, who, according to Agora's philosophy, should in the future get their heating primarily through heat pumps or district heating.

EU parliamentarian Geier is proposing a compromise. ""The EU should put regulation of competition for the hydrogen economy in the hands of individual member states."" Then each country could decide for itself which regime best suits its energy system. ""As industrial centers,"" he says, ""Germany and Europe have no time to lose.""

The German Heating Illusion

E.on executive Gabriël Clemens doesn't want to wait that long. He has been talking to some of his customers about building electrolyzers on site, even if small plants are significantly less efficient than those on a gigawatt scale.

Clemens points out that a supraregional transmission network would be of little help to most German companies. ""Small and medium-sized enterprises, the core of the German economy, are connected to the distribution networks."" He is thinking primarily of businesses that require high temperatures – glassworks, foundries or ceramics manufacturers, for example. The intricate distribution network would also be needed to realize some politicians' hope of potentially supplying every private boiler room with hydrogen in the near future."

The achievement is part of the European project HEAVEN, a consortium of six companies to demonstrate the feasibility of using liquid, cryogenic hydrogen in an aircraft, led by Stuttgart-based H2FLY.

Air Liquide designed and supplied the new liquid hydrogen storage system based on H2FLY’s requirements. It has now been successfully coupled with the fuel cell system on ground, which H2FLY described as ‘the final technological building block’ in the development of a complete hydrogen-electric powertrain using liquid hydrogen to power the HY4.

H2FLY’s four-seater HY4 demonstrator aircraft runs on hydrogen and fuel cells, producing zero emissions. Together with Air Liquide, H2FLY led the test campaign on Air Liquide’s Campus Technologies Grenoble, in Sassenage, France. The two companies worked together to develop new safety concepts in preparation for the coupling tests.

The successful coupling tests mark another step toward the upcoming ground and flight test campaign this summer. The milestone follows the company’s announcement last month that it passed its first filling tests with the integrated liquid hydrogen tank.

H2FLY believes it is the first company to successfully perform on-ground coupling tests with an aircraft-integrated LH2 tank and fuel system, proving its technological advancements with fuel cell systems, hydrogen storage systems and H2 fuel system design for CS-23 and CS-25 aircraft. CS-23 and CS-25 are regulations established by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) ensuring that aircraft meet the necessary standards for certification.

“With the successful passing of the on-ground coupling tests, we have learnt that it will be possible to scale up our technology for a 40-seater aircraft,” said Prof. Dr Josef Kallo, co-founder and CEO of H2FLY.

“We are thrilled to be making this crucial progress as we continue our efforts towards making sustainable medium and long-haul flight a reality.”"

As hybrid work becomes more and more prevalent and employees become less physically centralised, there is a heightened need for organisations to establish a sustainable digital infrastructure, one that helps their employees fight the constant waves of transitions in the years to follow. Technology may have become central to our ways of doing business, but creating a digital workplace where well-being and culture thrive has been an ongoing challenge for leaders. They now need a digital infrastructure that not only supports their vision for the future but also fosters a culture of inclusion, enabling organisations to adapt and retain top talent.So, where should employers begin their journey to improving digital workplace experiences? How can employers get it right when it comes to how they facilitate these interactions with technology? What are the existing gaps and how are they measuring them to provide a stellar employee experience To discuss how organisations must accelerate their digitalisation efforts to incorporate tools that will provide a thriving hybrid work environment, we invited YeeLin Chong - Head of HR Digital Solutions, APAC, at Air Liquide for an exclusive interview. After sharing some of the top trends in the HR Tech space, YeeLin took us through some of the major challenges that stand in the way of creating a successful digital employee experience and further added some of the key tips and tricks that will help organisations enhance the overall employee lifecycle with technology.“Today’s employees expect and desire a satisfying and consistent people experience, to be engaged, to feel valued, heard, and supported at key moments that matter in the employee lifecycle. They want to be equipped with intuitive, convenient, and engaging tools and processes, that are consumer grade, provide a seamless experience, coupled with a human touch at the workplace.” shared YeeLin.An HR Technology leader with an extensive HR career across the IT and financial sectors, Yee Lin Chong is Head of HR Digital Solutions, APAC, at Air Liquide. As an HR technology professional with global and regional leadership experiences in large corporations across a broad range of industries, she believes technology is integral to successful HR programs in the new ways of working for the future of work.Here are a few great highlights from the interview:The speed with which we’ve seen workforce trends changing and emerging during and out of the pandemic times highlights the following trends for us:1. A hybrid workplace with greater and greater dependence on technology and other automation processes is here to stay. The opportunity cost of not adapting to the new reality is high. Flextime has now become the standard across industries and organisations as employees prioritise their mental health and seek a perfect work-life balance. The recent focus on flexibility in the workplace has resulted in a very strong push for flex time across organisations for all employees. How and where our employees work, whether in a virtual environment or a flexible work arrangement are common topics at hiring interviews now. This pushes employers to focus on fostering employee engagement in a hybrid workplace, adapting to new ways of working, and developing new workplace planning models for skills and competencies of the future.2. This is a common refrain among HR leaders. As we invest and build people who are future-ready, we still face the great workforce re-shuffling, and the fight for talent, especially in domains such as HR Technology skills. Therefore, retention becomes a real challenge, with our talent being continually pitched; driving up the wages.3. As multi-talented employees are willing to change jobs more than ever, people can now look for new ventures easily beyond country borders, stretching our recruitment, mobility programmes, processes, and systems which now need to be better, with agile and adaptable designs to be future-ready.HR 4.0 trend is the latest revolution to hit the world of human resources. With it, HR has moved away from traditional, manual, and bureaucratic roles and is becoming more automated as it focuses on strategic issues within the organisation. Additionally, disruptive workforce trends and hybrid work have accelerated the need for managers and employees to adopt tech using mobile apps and to adapt quickly to digitisation at the workplace.Global organisations across different industries may inherit a legacy landscape that might not successfully drive digital transformation. In organisations with highly diverse businesses, a huge proportion of frontline field workers with completely decentralised HR legacy processes operate in remote sites, dispersed across cultures and languages. This is not an easy landscape for centralised HR technology.For a dynamic workplace and people who are doing more with less, the need for building critical skills and competencies in this day and age of talent shortage and rapid global workforce mobility has become an interrelated priority.Another challenge is fostering employee engagement in such a hybrid workplace. We need to raise the game of personalising the workplace experience as we introduce automation and digitisation.The change management aspect can be challenging as well as new digital ways of working are introduced, and people must adapt to the new ways of working, and make this a part of their everyday work life.In any successful HR Transformation programme leveraging technology to improve operational efficiencies, it is imperative to identify the key drivers of the new operating model. In the world of work with rapidly evolving workforce trends and the global fight for talent, it becomes very important to anchor the digital transformation programme in bringing out a Superior Employee Experience (EX) for better engagement, retention, managing virtual teams, & diversity and inclusion goals.Today’s employees expect and desire a satisfying and consistent people experience, to be engaged, to feel valued, heard, and supported at key moments that matter in the employee lifecycle. They want to be equipped with intuitive, convenient, and engaging tools and processes, that are consumer grade, provide a seamless experience, coupled with a human touch at the workplace. They expect nothing less than the convenience and satisfaction that they experience in their everyday lives beyond the workplace, such as on social media.The remote work during the pandemic and the complete isolation that was experienced in recent times have raised acute awareness that our employees still value the physical connections and therefore, there is a need to maintain face-to-face engagement and the employee’s well-being now becomes a priority.A driving objective to put EX central to our programme design is fundamental to the final outcome of the digitisation programme.People managers need to be equipped with programmes and tools that empower them to take quick actions and make decisions to keep the workforce motivated, happy, and productive in the hybrid workplace, during the whole spectrum of the employee life cycle events.Especially more so in the Hybrid future world of work, we need to leverage automation capabilities to consciously bring the manager to the center of people Management responsibilities so that they can be involved in their career movement discussions with better visibility into data and metrics.Digital platforms deliver a higher level of employee services and provide convenience and consistency for organisations to reap productivity gains. With these platforms, managers can better manage remote, virtual teams. With automation in place, they get real-time visibility into their workforce data and analytics across geographies, replacing outdated, disjointed, and legacy or manual ways of working.In designing our HR Transformation programmes with automation as a key pillar, it is important to have a cross-functional approach. By not designing technology solutions in silos, we will be able to deliver a complete end-to-end employee experience. We also stay relevant by designing technology solutions that are relevant and providing tools and services for a seamless employee experience journey.Post-pandemic, digital agility will be instrumental in ensuring business success. Only by adopting innovative technology solutions that unlock insightful data, can organizations make faster decisions and fully capitalize on and develop their talents, providing them with the best environment to grow and thrive in a rapidly changing world.Our HR technology strategy must reflect this changing work dynamics towards simplification, harmonization, and flexibility, which is driving the quest for work-life balance for the high-performing workforce of the future.The right digitalisation programmes bring employee welfare topics to our attention, the employee voice and sentiment into the center arena, empowering managers to take quick actions and make decisions to keep the workforce motivated, productive, and happy in the whole spectrum of people management. They keep them involved in career discussions, employee recognition, and well-being topics, elevating the whole workplace experience and helping teams to achieve higher goals.With more and more unpredictable, disruptive trends on the horizon ahead, we need to remember to have a strong leadership culture that set an example by being adaptable and flexible, bold, compassionate, humane, and empathetic. Reflecting these key principles in our HR Technology programmes design creates a positive employee and total workplace experience. We need to continue to future-proof our HR technology programmes with scalable solutions and platforms, to stay relevant to the workforce of the future."
Kazakhstan and France Expand Bilateral Cooperation - Astana Times,"Wed, 03 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vYXN0YW5hdGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUva2F6YWtoc3Rhbi1hbmQtZnJhbmNlLWV4cGFuZC1iaWxhdGVyYWwtY29vcGVyYXRpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ASTANA – France is one of the key trade, economic and strategic partners of Kazakhstan in the European region, and one of the top five major investors, Kazakh Minister of Industry and Infrastructure Development Marat Karabayev said at the 15th session of the Kazakh-French Intergovernmental Commission. Karabayev co-chaired the event with Olivier Becht, Minister-Delegate for Foreign Trade, Economic Attractiveness, and French Nationals Abroad, the Kazakh Ministry’s press service reported on May 3.

The 15th session of the Kazakh-French Intergovernmental Commission was hosted the day after President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev met with Olivier Becht to discuss economic cooperation between the two countries, including in the spheres of agriculture, digitalization, healthcare, energy, industry, and transport.

Lafarge's unique CO2 capture project in Poland - Executive Magazine,"Fri, 19 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vZXhlY3V0aXZlbWFnYXppbmUucGwvZW4vcG9wdWxhci1hcnRpY2xlcy9sYWZhcmdlcy11bmlxdWUtY28yLWNhcHR1cmUtcHJvamVjdC1pbi1wb2xhbmQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The cement sector is characterized by a high degree of innovation in introducing solutions conducive to reducing the negative impact on the environment. The drive towards decarbonization means that innovative technologies must be sought and implemented. Lafarge has undertaken global scale venture and will create an infrastructure capable of absorbing 1 million tons of carbon dioxide per year from cement production.

Kujawy Go4ECOPlanet is a carbon capture and storage (CCS) project. The Lafarge-owned Kujawy Cement Plant will build infrastructure to capture carbon dioxide from the outlet gases of the clinker kiln, the main ingredient in cement production. It will capture 100% of the CO2 emissions generated from clinker production. This will also enable the plant to produce cement with very low emissions. The installation will be based on Air Liquide’s Cryocap™ FG technology. It has been tested for more than 5 years at the Air Liquide facility of France, while the company’s solutions are used in many countries on an industrial scale. Over 10 years, more than ten million tons of CO2 will be captured, representing 10% of Poland’s annual emissions of the entire cement sector. As a result, Kujawy Cement Plant will become one of the first net zero-emission cement plants in Europe.

Noteworthy, the application of capture on an industrial scale will allow the technology to be replicated in other cement plants and industries in Europe. The next step is to create a full carbon capture and storage chain. Captured carbon dioxide will be transported by rail to a transshipment point in a seaport and delivered by ship to the North Sea. Permanent storage will take place in specially designated depleted caverns from gas and oil fields. This will be made possible through cooperation with other partners with expertise and experience in liquefaction, transport, and storage of gases, and is part of a separate project in a consortium that also includes Lafarge in Poland.

The Kujawy Go4ECOPlanet project is one of the most essential elements of Lafarge’s sustainable development strategy in Poland and the Holcim Group. It helps achieve the goals of the European Green Deal in accordance with legislation aimed at achieving climate neutrality by 2050.

On January 19, 2023, in Brussels, Lafarge and Innovation Found signed an agreement for funding the project. The cost of the Kujawy Go4ECOPlanet project for 10 years is 380 million euros. EU funding is €228 million. The installation is scheduled to be commissioned in January 2027.

Lafarge has already been making several investments in modernizing the production of building materials that reduce CO2 emissions. All these measures, combined with CO2 capture, will result in a significant reduction in the carbon footprint of concrete and the construction sector, which will slowly create truly green buildings and other infrastructure facilities.

Innovative technologies such as CO2 capture and storage are essential to promote industrial decarbonization in Poland and Europe. CCS investments such as Kujawy Go4ECOPlanet, in addition to fulfilling their main objective of improving the environment, can also become a driving force for the economy. There are studies indicating that the CCS sector can globally generate around 50,000 jobs in total. With projects like Kujawy Go4ECOPlanet, Poland can take a leadership position in this field.

Powering the toughest bullbars with TUFF Australia - Manufactures Monthly,"Wed, 10 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hbm1vbnRobHkuY29tLmF1L3Bvd2VyaW5nLXRoZS10b3VnaGVzdC1idWxsYmFycy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TUFF Group – a manufacturer of high-quality bullbars, ute trays, and canopies – has come a long way from its humble beginnings 20 years ago. The company was founded by Phil and Anton Griffiths, a father-son pair who immigrated to Toowoomba, Queensland from Zimbabwe. Phil’s background in mining engineering and Anton’s experience in business and processes allowed them to combine their skills to develop their own business, starting with only five staff. It was all hands on deck in the early days, with Phil on the welder making jigs while Anton learned the trade of fitting bullbars. After six years of a growing reputation in Queensland, the company became TUFF Bullbars Australia, now known as TUFF Australia. As the TUFF reputation grew, the number of bullbars increased to the point that TUFF required its own powder coating facility, to reduce lead times for clients and to ensure quality expectations were met. This lead to the establishment of TUFF Coatings in 2008. Mark Casey, General Manager at TUFF Group, said the family business is proud to reflect on its journey so far. “We’ve placed importance as we’ve grown on keeping ourselves grounded and maintaining a family atmosphere,” he said. “We see it as a big family, and we have people who’ve worked here for 15 years – those people have helped build the business. The person that started off sweeping the floor as a young guy is now our operations manager. We worked on developing our people, developing our customer base, and the big thing is to deliver what we say we’re going to deliver.” TUFF Group found a niche in developing premium bull bar products that can withstand impacts in extremely harsh environments. The company’s early footprint in Western Queensland was with customers who needed bull bars to withstand a lot of impact with an extra layer of durability. The farming community in New South Wales continues to be a large customer base. As the company evolved, it expanded into the market for tradies, people who have Dodge Ram or Ford F trucks and those who want to take caravans around the country.

“Our demographic and the people we serve has expanded quite a lot from our original group,” Casey said. “A big development for us was in 2007 when we started making utility trays. That helped with our diversification ambitions, and that’s expanded very quickly. We do custom canopies and a variety of other types of products as well.” Underlying this expansion is a clear focus on quality, which has earned the company a strong reputation in the market. Casey explained that the business has worked hard on progressing quality as it grows, which is why TUFF recently employed its own Quality Manager with extensive industry experience. “We’ve got a strong focus on quality and durability, and that’s something that our customers really appreciate. We’ve had customers come back to us after 17 years and say, ‘I need a new bull bar, and I want it to be a TUFF one.’” Honesty is the other essential part of the company’s philosophy, both in dealings with their own staff and in dealings with customers. This honesty and integrity is reflected in the fact that TUFF Group has a large number of repeat customers, including car dealers, private individuals, and large businesses who rely on their products for their fleets. Today, TUFF employs over 100 people and is producing more automotive aftermarket products than ever at its Towoomba factory. Last year, the business forked out heavy investments to increase and improve its manufacturing capacity. TUFF purchased a new 6.5 kilowatt laser and brake press from Japan in order to have a more vertically integrated operation. The new machinery means products can be easily cut and folded with more precision, improving the outcome of products like ute canopies. A new tube vendor for bending brush rails and headboards for utes was another major investment with the same intention.

Air Liquide quality Air Liquide has a long-standing history of supplying high-quality gas for welding purposes. For more than 100 years, it has provided manufacturers with gases that are essential for welding. As technologies evolve, Air Liquide continually adapts its gas solutions to respond to the challenges of metal fabrication and manufacturing processes. For instance, the LASALTM range is a full range of lasing gases with the industry’s highest purity standards for every laser resonator. The choice of lasing gas directly determines the reliability of the laser, lifespan and accuracy of the optics and output power. Thanks to its research and development prowess in Japan, France and around the world, Air Liquide has pioneered the laser industry standard for effective and consistent control of impurities. Upon purchasing a range of new equipment, TUFF started its journey with Air Liquide for the first time. Air Liquide introduced TUFF to ARCALTM Speed, a high-performance gas shielding mixture designed for high speed welding processes. Benefits of ARCALTM Speed are:

• Low fumes

• Low Splatter

• Increased productivity due to reduced post weld processing TUFF is already seeing the benefits of Air Liquide’s EXELTOPTM which leads the industry in Quality, Safety and Efficiency with its dual-stage inbuilt regulator and quick fit gas line connection, meaning no tools are required to change cylinders. Plans to drive further efficiencies with TUFF planned with Air Liquide’s workshop reticulation offer, which includes a DATAL Semi-automatic manifold that uses multiple packs of any ARCALTM gas mixture and is coupled with a telemetry system (DALIA) that is monitored by Air Liquide. DALIA communicates with Air Liquide and when a predetermined low setpoint is hit, the system automatically orders replacement packs. This process further strengthens the reliability of the customers business. The DALIA system can be solar powered and has options for extended antennas to give customers in remote regional areas to be on a level playing field with their competitors in metropolitan areas."
From big gas kettle to big battery: The energy “time tunnel” at Torrens Island - RenewEconomy,"Fri, 19 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vcmVuZXdlY29ub215LmNvbS5hdS9mcm9tLWJpZy1nYXMta2V0dGxlLXRvLWJpZy1iYXR0ZXJ5LXRoZS1lbmVyZ3ktdGltZS10dW5uZWwtYXQtdG9ycmVucy1pc2xhbmQv0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly9yZW5ld2Vjb25vbXkuY29tLmF1L2Zyb20tYmlnLWdhcy1rZXR0bGUtdG8tYmlnLWJhdHRlcnktdGhlLWVuZXJneS10aW1lLXR1bm5lbC1hdC10b3JyZW5zLWlzbGFuZC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"At AGL Energy’s Torrens Island Power Station, just half an hour out of the Adelaide CBD, there’s a sort of suspended walkway joining the 480MW A power station, completed in 1967, with the 800MW B station, completed in 1982.

Both are gas power generators – although Torrens A was initially oil-fired back in the 1960s – and the 15-year age difference between the two plants is starkly evident, particularly now that Torrens A is fully decommissioned.

In fact, so dramatic was the evolution in gas power generation technology over those 15 years that the walkway between the two facilities – pictured below – has become affectionately known at Torrens Island as the Time Tunnel.

The nickname has proved prophetic. In 2023, the whole of the Torrens Island facility has become a Time Tunnel of sorts: a museum of power generation past, present and future.

In the past sits the mothballed Torrens A, with its incredibly impressive post-war technology, including a piece of kit called the “governor,” which AGL’s Kevin Taylor – who first worked at Torrens in 1986 – tells us was used to keep the machines running at 3000 rpm; the original version of inertia.

“The governor” at the mothballed Torrens A gas station. Image: Sophie Vorrath

In the present, although only just, sits Torrens B, which is due to close all four of its 200MW units by June 30, 2026, when the facility turns 50 years old.

That plant, which had previously been scheduled to close around 2035, is based on steam turbine technology that, while cutting edge at the time, has more recently been compared to a giant kettle – pretty useless to a renewables dominated grid like South Australia where flexibility is king.

Repairs underway at Torrens B will help carry the plant through to 2026. Image: Sophie Vorrath

More firmly in the present is the 210MW Barker Inlet Power Station, or BIPS, which AGL commissioned in 2017, adjacent to Torrens B, using 12 reciprocating engines that are able to go from a cold start to full load in five minutes. A big jump from the 16 hours it takes Torrens B.

This shiny new machine is described by AGL as a “fit for purpose,” fast gas and diesel, peaker plant that can jump in and out of the market to address an imbalance between supply and demand. It’s also much less emissions intensive than its 1980s predecessor.

One of the engines at Barker Inlet Power Station. Image: Sophie Vorrath

AGL’s Taylor says the benefits of plants like BIPS is they can come in and run for as long as they have fuel. But mostly, they’re in and out of the market, often for only one-and-a-half hours at a time to fill in the gaps when renewables cannot meet demand.

Which brings us to the Torrens Island battery – the 250MW/250MWh battery AGL has installed with Finish group Wärtsilä, and using SMA technology, on the site that used to be occupied by fuel tanks that once stored the oil for Torrens A.

The battery occupies both the present and the future in the Torrens Time Tunnel – it’s currently on target to come fully online in the second half of this year, when it will be used to perform a similar role to BIPS in providing firming for renewables, as well as other market services.

View of the Torrens battery from the roof of the B station. Image: Sophie Vorrath

“I think most probably we are cannibalising our own business,” says AGL COO Markus Brokhof. “But, you know, if we don’t cannibalise it then somebody else will … because at the end of the day… batteries are also in competition with gas plants.”

For now, the battery won’t eat too much of BIPS’ lunch, being only a one-hour facility, and will mainly be used for some arbitrage opportunities – charging during times of peak renewables and then discharging in the evening demand peaks; as well as providing market services for AEMO and participating in the capacity market for FCAS products.

But a future part of the equation is the battery’s potential to scale up to 1000MWh or four hours of energy storage capacity, when its role could grow to encompass longer duration energy storage and arbitrage or other as-yet unexplored market services.

The main missing piece for the renewable future, as Brokhof says, is to find ways to store – or shift, or use – the huge amount of surplus renewables washing around the South Australia grid during the middle of the day, that regularly sends wholesale energy prices for the state into negative territory.

“When energy prices are negative… you should use that energy in the market and make a profitable business case out of it,” says Brokhof.

AGL is exploring a number of ways it might do this at Torrens, including through the potential construction of a hydrogen electrolyser on the Island, as well as feasibility study backed by ARENA into the possibilities of using thermal storage technology.

Another future-focused technology being used by AGL on the island is carbon capture and re-use, in partnership with French-based industrial gases company, Air Liquide.

Air Liquide takes off a portion of AGL’s flue gas and extracts “a very clean” CO2 from that and uses that for medical, industrial or food purposes, including wine bottling, waste water treatment instead of using acids, and in public swimming pools.

“I think it’s very important for us to have an ongoing discussion with these industrial partners,” Brokhof says. “Our concept of circular economy should be one of the main ingredients at all sites, but also at Torrens.”
