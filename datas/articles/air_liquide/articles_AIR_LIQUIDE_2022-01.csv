Renewable hydrogen: the great ambition of Energy Observer & Air Liquide - Air Liquide,"Tue, 04 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvaHlkcm9nZW4vcmVuZXdhYmxlLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLWdyZWF0LWFtYml0aW9uLWVuZXJneS1vYnNlcnZlci1haXItbGlxdWlkZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide's partnership with Energy Observer can be summed up in a few words: the encounter of two energies. Hydrogen is of course at the heart of this collaboration. Hydrogen on a large scale as a solution for a carbon-free world. This logical, natural partnership began with the launch of the boat in April 2017. It was strengthened further in 2021 as Air Liquide became a main partner. Beyond the famous boat itself, the Energy Observer approach is global, just like that of Air Liquide, a pioneer in the international development of hydrogen. Concretely, this partnership is already geared towards two dimensions: public awareness and technological innovation. Read on for explanations.

Spreading the word about hydrogen to the world

When it comes to the energy transition, the time has come for action and solutions. If Air Liquide has been a partner in the laboratory ship project since its inception, supported by its captain Victorien Erussard, it is because it is opening up new avenues for ""zero emission"" mobility in the maritime sector. It is also because it helps to show all audiences, on all continents, to what extent hydrogen contributes to the energy transition.

Energy Observer is much more than a boat: it’s a great idea that travels the world emitting as little carbon as possible. A commitment that led Victorien Erussard to be appointed the first French ambassador of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by the Ministry for the Ecological and Inclusive Transition in 2018. His mission? Convey France's message on the need to act in all aspects of the ecological transition and inspire as many players as possible.

The first dimension of Energy Observer’s partnership is the support provided by Air Liquide to the “Energy Observer Foundation”. Its mission is to bring together expertise to accelerate the energy transition and make all audiences aware of the potential and challenges presented by hydrogen and promote the 17 SDGs. These objectives address subjects that are vital for populations, governments and businesses: the environment, biodiversity protection, climate, health, equality, education and even clean energy. A roadmap in line with the sustainable development objectives of the Air Liquide group, and in particular with its commitments in relation to the development of renewable hydrogen."

Fire at Slate Belt plant leads to boil water advisory for 500 customers in Portland area - The Morning Call,"Thu, 13 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1jYWxsLmNvbS8yMDIyLzAxLzEzL2ZpcmUtYXQtc2xhdGUtYmVsdC1wbGFudC1sZWFkcy10by1ib2lsLXdhdGVyLWFkdmlzb3J5LWZvci01MDAtY3VzdG9tZXJzLWluLXBvcnRsYW5kLWFyZWEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Residents in Portland and Upper Mount Bethel Township were told to boil their water after a fire broke out late Wednesday night in the Air Liquide Advanced Materials plant near Route 611.

The fire was reported at 11:30 p.m. at Air Liquide on Demi Road in Upper Mount Bethel Township, which is in the Portland Industrial Park.

A fire broke out late Wednesday, January 12, 2020, at the Air Liquide Advance Materials Plant in Upper Mount Bethel and continued into Thursday morning.

No injuries were reported, but the fire took about four hours to extinguish, according to former Portland Mayor Lance Prator, chair of the Portland Borough Water Authority.

The fire scene was cleared about 3 a.m. Thursday, according to a Northampton County emergency management dispatcher. Messages left with fire officials and Air Liquide’s media relations were not returned.

Township manager Ed Nelson said the fire originated from a leaking thermocouple, which is an electrical device. Fire officials were still meeting with Air Liquide representatives to determine more on the cause and damage, he said.

A woman who answered the telephone at the plant said she did not know who from the company would be authorized to speak about the blaze.

Tanker trucks were requested from neighboring fire companies, including Warren County, New Jersey, to fight the blaze. Water from the tankers was used to cool burning equipment carrying Disilane, a colorless, extremely flammable gas, to prevent a large explosion and possible large scale incident if other chemicals on site were involved, the Hope Volunteer Fire Department said in a Facebook post.

The Portland authority was reporting low water pressure throughout its water system following the fire.

Normal pressure was expected by Thursday afternoon, Prator said, but residents and customers were advised to boil their water until further notice. The authority serves 500 residential customers in Portland and Upper Mount Bethel, plus three businesses in the industrial park, he said.

When the water system is drained, such as from a fire or a main break, a series of water tests must be performed to ensure water quality before the boil advisory can be lifted, according to Prator. That could take days, and the process could be compounded by Monday being a holiday, he said.

Air Liquide materials are used in the production of semiconductor devices and advanced solar cells, enabling — among other things — computer chips to consume less power yet have higher memory density.

The Portland Industrial Park is seen here Thursday, Jan. 12, 2022, in Upper Mount Bethel and continued into Thursday morning.

Air Liquide in October 2018 opened a new facility at the former Formica-Surell plant at 1379 N. Delaware Drive in Upper Mount Bethel, an expansion announced during that summer that was to create 188 high-paying jobs while retaining 80 positions over the next three years. The North Delaware Drive facility is nearly four miles southwest of the Demi Road site of the fire.

Industry Support for Large-Scale Carbon Capture and Storage Continues to Gain Momentum in Houston - PR Newswire,"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2luZHVzdHJ5LXN1cHBvcnQtZm9yLWxhcmdlLXNjYWxlLWNhcmJvbi1jYXB0dXJlLWFuZC1zdG9yYWdlLWNvbnRpbnVlcy10by1nYWluLW1vbWVudHVtLWluLWhvdXN0b24tMzAxNDY0OTAxLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"HOUSTON, Jan. 20, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Three additional companies have announced their support for exploring the implementation of large-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology in and around the Houston industrial area. Air Liquide, BASF and Shell are joining Calpine, Chevron, Dow, ExxonMobil, INEOS, Linde, LyondellBasell, Marathon Petroleum, NRG Energy, Phillips 66 and Valero to collectively evaluate and advance emissions reduction efforts in and around the Houston industrial area. Today's announcement increases the momentum for CCS and aligns with efforts to reduce emissions around the world.

The 14 companies are evaluating how to use safe, proven CCS technology at Houston-area facilities that provide energy and products for modern life, including power generation and advanced manufacturing for plastics, motor fuels and packaging. In December 2021, the companies held a series of workshops at the University of Houston to discuss collaboration and activation of this important, large-scale emissions-reduction effort.

Together, these companies and others in the region could capture and safely store up to 50 million metric tons of CO 2 per year by 2030 and about 100 million metric tons per year by 2040, helping to significantly reduce emissions in the Houston region.

These efforts have already gained broad support in the Houston region, including from Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, the Harris County Commissioners' Court, the Greater Houston Partnership and the Center for Houston's Future.

""Large-scale carbon capture and storage in the Houston region will be a cornerstone for the world's energy transition, and these companies' efforts are crucial toward advancing CCS development to achieve broad scale commercial impact,"" said Charles McConnell, director of University of Houston's Center for Carbon Management in Energy and former assistant secretary in the U.S. Department of Energy. ""As the energy capital of the world, Houston has the expertise and leadership—including industry, academia and policymakers—to realize a low carbon, reliable and affordable energy future. I look forward to working alongside these 14 companies to make Houston the global leader in CCS.""

Wide-scale, affordable deployment of CCS in the Houston area will require the support of industry, communities and government. If appropriate policies and regulations are put in place, CCS could help the United States and Houston reach net-zero goals while generating new jobs and protecting existing jobs that are important to Houston's economy. CCS could also promote long-term economic growth in Southeast Texas and beyond.

CCS is the process of capturing CO 2 from industrial activities that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere and injecting it into deep underground geologic formations for secure and permanent storage. CO 2 from the Houston industrial area could be stored in nearby on- and offshore storage sites. An analysis of U.S Department of Energy estimates shows the storage capacity along the U.S. Gulf Coast is large enough to store about 500 billion metric tons of CO 2 , which is equivalent to more than 130 years of industrial and power generation emissions in the United States, based on 2018 data.

CCS is one of the few proven technologies that could enable some industry sectors that are difficult to decarbonize, such as manufacturing and heavy industry, to decrease greenhouse gas emissions. The International Energy Agency projects that CCS could mitigate up to 15% of global emissions by 2040, and the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates global decarbonization efforts could be twice as costly without the technology.

Discussions continue with other companies that have industrial operations in the Houston region, potentially increasing the projected total CO 2 that can be captured and safely stored.

Hydrogen mobility plays a big role in this ranking. The country aims to become the world leader in 2040. The country's real strategic goal in the context of energy transition, is where hydrogen drives the Korean economy and mobilizes a number of industrial players. Here, Air Liquide naturally finds its place as a global player in hydrogen. Together with many local partners, the Group is developing the sector across the entire value chain (production, storage, distribution, application) and several large-scale projects. Somie Kim, Vice President Hydrogen Energy of Air Liquide Korea, tells us more.

In Korea, innovation is seen everywhere. In companies, but also in the street and the whole country. It’s quite impressive! Please tell us, what is the secret of this country?

It’s very simple! The Korean government is actively promoting digital transformation, such as carbon neutrality through eco-friendly policies and expansion of investment in promising industries such as data, network, artificial intelligence, robots and drones.

And hydrogen is at the center of this strategy?

Yes, absolutely. The hydrogen economy is one of three strategic industries that the Korean government is fostering as future growth engines, and it is also included in the Korea New Deal policy announced in July 2021. Through massive investments and regulatory improvement, the Korean New Deal, aiming to transform the economy to make it greener, with more digital services and stronger safety nets with a total investment of 160 billion euro (220 trillion Korean Won) to create more than 1.9 million jobs by 2025.

What is the goal of the other plan named “Hydrogen Economy Roadmap” launched by the government?

In January 2019, the Korean government expressed its vision to become a global leader in hydrogen vehicles and fuel cells by 2040, and announced an ambitious roadmap which outlined the goal of producing 6.2 million fuel cell vehicles and rolling out at least 1,200 hydrogen stations by 2040.

For this reason hydrogen mobility is the heart of the problem. Why is that according to you?

Simply because hydrogen mobility is expected to greatly contribute to reducing greenhouse gases and fine dust!

Air Liquide holds a core position in this matter. How do they align with this plan?

Air Liquide Korea is well recognized as a great contributor to the development of the hydrogen ecosystem in Korea together with Hyundai Motor, with which we maintain a close partnership. In the downstream market, we are participating in the HyNet Consortium with 13 companies. HyNet aims to build up 100 hydrogen stations for passenger cars by 2022.

Focusing on Heavy Duty market development, in August 2020, we invested in the Incheon Airport Flagship Project and signed a contract for the installation of the largest hydrogen bus station in Korea and a 10-year hydrogen supply contract. And then, in March 2021, we entered into another consortium named KOHYGEN to build hydrogen stations for buses and trucks. KOHYGEN targets to build and operate 300 heavy duty hydrogen stations by 2040. Air Liquide is the only International Gas Company joining these two consortiums in Korea."

Delivered by barge via the Mississippi River, the 2,000-ton load replaces natural clay and fine aggregate as raw feeds at the Holcim (US) Ste. Genevieve mill in Missouri, North America’s largest cement operation.

“This milestone is a tangible example of how industry participants can develop creative and efficient solutions that contribute to the circular economy. Together, LafargeHolcim, Geocycle and CenterPoint Energy will avoid landfilling for power plants and reduce the consumption of non-renewable raw materials. This is a clear win-win for people and our planet,” says LafargeHolcim U.S. Cement CEO Toufic Tabbara.

The partners have invested more than $80 million in infrastructure to extract, process, store and consume coal combustion residuals (CCR)—primarily bottom ash plus non-spec fly ash—from a 165-acre pond at the utility’s A.B. Brown generating station in Evansville, Ind. They project recycling of 6 million-plus tons of ash over the current contract. It extends a 12-year program during which Geocycle has harvested and dispatched to Ste. Genevieve nearly 1.5 million tons of dry fly ash waste from A.B. Brown and two Indiana sister generating stations.

With careful material sourcing and testing, the new initiative advances the treatment of ponded CCR, traditionally written off for use in cement and concrete production. Geocycle’s beneficiation technology, tested on CenterPoint and other generating station deposits, is being deployed in markets experiencing fly ash shortages due to the ongoing retirement of coal-fired power plants.

“Our initiative with LafargeHolcim and Geocycle has been the ideal solution as it has allowed for the material to be removed from the environment and used for beneficial purposes,” affirms CenterPoint Senior Vice President, Indiana Electric Operations Steve Greenley. “Our decision to recycle coal ash has reduced the impact on the environment and allowed for a choice with less financial impact than other compliance options.”

“This significant circular-economy relationship with CenterPoint Energy is a powerful example of how our recycling management business seeks innovative solutions to turn ecosystem challenges into opportunities that contribute value to our operations and advance commitment to a Net Zero future,” observes Geocycle North America Head Sophie Wu."

ETN Buzz

Siemens Energy and Air Liquide have announced that they will co-create industrial-scale hydrogen projects by joining their expertise in proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis technology.

The companies’ strategy to lay the ground for mass manufacturing of electrolyzers in Europe, particularly in Germany and France, and R&D activities to co-develop next-generation electrolyzer technologies.

To meet rapidly growing demand, and to lower costs, it is key to accelerate the production of sustainably generated hydrogen through large-scale PEM electrolyzers. In the framework of their cooperation, Siemens Energy and Air Liquide will jointly apply for large projects funding under the EU’s Green Deal and Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI)-scheme for hydrogen, funded by the French and German Governments. The IPCEI-funding is required to fast start those activities and meet the challenging timeline set out by the European Green New Deal, the EU Hydrogen Strategy as well as the French and German National Hydrogen Strategies.

With this cooperation, Siemens Energy and Air Liquide will reinforce their core competencies facilitating the emergence of a sustainable hydrogen economy in Europe and initiating a European ecosystem for electrolysis and hydrogen technology together with other partners. The partners have already identified cooperation opportunities for large scale sustainable hydrogen projects both in France, Germany, and other European countries. One of these opportunities is the Air Liquide-H2V Normandy project in France with a capacity of 200 MW, one of the most ambitious European projects for hydrogen production from renewable energies.

“Building up a sustainable hydrogen economy will still require to amend the framework conditions in the energy market,” said Christian Bruch, CEO of Siemens Energy. “However, it will be through partnerships and collaboration that we can shape this market. We highly appreciate to co-create innovative solutions with Air Liquide. Collectively we will overcome the challenges that lie ahead to industrialize the technology and make sustainably generated hydrogen a success story.”

Benoît Potier, Chairman, and CEO of Air Liquide said hydrogen is a key enabler of the energy transition. In the context of unprecedented acceleration in Europe of hydrogen technologies and markets, the time to scale-up is now, notably in France and Germany.

“The partnership between Air Liquide and Siemens Energy paves the way for the creation of a leading European ecosystem capable of supplying decarbonized hydrogen at competitive prices and promoting the emergence of a low-carbon society. We look forward to this Franco-German cooperation,” Potier said.

Bruno Le Maire, French Minister of Economy, Finance, and Recovery, said that through the “France Relance” program, 7 billion euros will be invested in hydrogen between now and 2030.

“The ambitious project of Air Liquide and Siemens Energy is only the beginning of an industrial cooperation that must develop beyond a Franco-German alliance,” Le Maire said. “The recovery must be above all a European recovery. I also salute Air Liquide’s mobilization in the framework of the French hydrogen plan, notably through its participation and commitment within the National Hydrogen Council.”"
Scandinavian Biogas in another bio-LNG move - LNG Prime,"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vbG5ncHJpbWUuY29tL2V1cm9wZS9zY2FuZGluYXZpYW4tYmlvZ2FzLWluLWFub3RoZXItYmlvLWxuZy1tb3ZlLzM5ODg5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sweden-based Scandinavian Biogas is continuing to invest in bio-LNG production plants in order to cater to the increasing demand for the fuel.

The biogas producer said it would invest 300 million Swedish crowns ($32.3 million) to expand its plant in Glado Kvarn on Sodertorn, located south of Stockholm, to produce bio-LNG.

Once completed in the second half of 2023, the plant would produce 220 GWh of bio-LNG per year, making it the largest of its kind in northern Europe, according to the firm.

By comparison, 220 GWh corresponds to an energy volume of 22 million liters of diesel, it said.

This would make the plant even larger than the company’s facility in Norway’s Skogn, Scandinavian Biogas said.

Air Liquide to supply equipment

Scandinavian Biogas said it would cooperate on the project with Gasnatet Stockholm regarding gas infrastructure and with Stockholm Water and Waste at Henriksdal in Stockholm.

France’s industrial gas company Air Liquide would supply the equipment for biogas liquefaction, Scandinavian Biogas said, but it did not provide any additional information regarding the contract.

Moreover, the plant will liquefy both biogas from Glado Kvarn as well as from the production plant in Henriksdal in Stockholm.

The liquid gas from Henriksdal reaches Glado Kvarn via an expanded gas network.

“The advantage of making the gas liquid is that it then only uses one sixth as much tank volume compared to compressed gas and thus logistics and use become significantly more cost-effective, which makes it possible to sell the product throughout Europe,” the firm said.

Swedish grant

Scandinavian Biogas said the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency through Klimatklivet has granted the company 135 million Swedish crowns ($14.5 million) in investment support for the bio-LNG project.

Matti Vikkula, CEO of Scandinavian Biogas said demand for bio-LNG, “is pointing strongly upwards.”

“Bio-LNG is increasingly used in heavy transport, but we believe that in the future there will also be a market in shipping and industry, and even in the production of fossil-free steel, biogas is expected to play an important role,” he said.

The firm has made large investments in liquefied biogas in recent years.

In December, Scandinavian Biogas said it had secured about $17 million from the government to build a bio-LNG plant in southern Sweden.

Scandinavian Biogas expects construction to start during the first half of 2022 while the facility could go online in 2024.

Also, Scandinavian Biogas has last year extended its agreement with Dutch LNG supplier Rolande for deliveries of bio-LNG.

The supplies are for several years, totaling about 90 GWh of bio-LNG per year."

The six projects that will mark the launch of green hydrogen in Chile - Marca Chile,"Wed, 05 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmNhY2hpbGUuY2wvZW4vMjAyMi8wMS8wNS90aGUtc2l4LXByb2plY3RzLXRoYXQtd2lsbC1tYXJrLXRoZS1sYXVuY2gtb2YtZ3JlZW4taHlkcm9nZW4taW4tY2hpbGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Chile is looking to position itself as a world leader in green hydrogen production and has announced a series of projects in the northern and southernmost areas of the country. The initiatives are being promoted by Enel Green Power, Linde, ENGIE, Air Liquide, GNL Quintero and CAP, and will attract US$1 billion in investments.

Chile is making steady progress towards efforts to position itself as a global leader in renewable energy, with the goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. The country is drawing on natural advantages such as having the world’s greatest solar radiation and outstanding wind resources, as well as its local human talent. Green hydrogen will be an important part of this strategy.

Chile will host the fourth Green Hydrogen Summit on January 19. The virtual event will bring together thousands of people around the development of green hydrogen initiatives in Chile and Latin America.

Chile’s Economic Development Agency, CORFO, has selected six proposals in the first call for applications to develop green hydrogen production plants in Chile, with the goal of speeding up the development of these initiatives. The facilities must begin operating by December 2025 at the latest. They will allow Chile to respond to the challenges of climate change, as well as to promote investment in clean energy, job creation and business startup opportunities at the local level.

The successful proposals will attract US$1 billion in investment and aim to produce more than 45,000 tons of green hydrogen per year, which will reduce annual CO2 emissions by more than 600,000 tons.

The winning projects are listed below:

HyEx – Producción Hidrógeno Verde (Green Hydrogen Production): Led by the French company ENGIE, the project aims to build an industrial-scale pilot plant in Antofagasta to generate 3,200 tons of green hydrogen per year. This green hydrogen will then be supplied to Enaex for green ammonia production, in order to reduce CO2 emissions by more than 30,000 tons per year.

Antofagasta Mining Energy Renewable (AMER): This Air Liquide S.A. initiative, which is also located in the Antofagasta Region, hopes to produce 60,000 tons of ethanol per year using renewable energy, green hydrogen and CO2 captured from a fixed source.

HyPro Aconcagua: The proposal presented by the German firm Linde involves replacing part of the gray hydrogen currently produced in the Aconcagua oil refinery located in the Valparaíso Region, which belongs to the state-owned petroleum company Empresa Nacional de Petróleos (ENAP). The project will generate 3,000 tons of green hydrogen per year.

Hidrógeno Verde Bahía Quintero (Bahía Quintero Green Hydrogen): Led by GNL Quintero S.A., this project includes the development, construction and operation of the first large-scale green hydrogen plant located in central Chile’s Valparaíso Region. The project will produce 430 tons of green hydrogen per year.

H2V CAP: This project involves setting up a green hydrogen plant in the Biobío Region. The plant will produce 1,550 tons of green hydrogen per year and will reduce CO2 emissions by more than 161,000 tons.

Proyecto Faro del Sur (Southern Lighthouse Project): Presented by the Italian company Enel Green Power, this project will produce 25,000 tons of green hydrogen per year in the Magallanes Region. The green hydrogen will be sold to HIF Chile, who will then produce ethanol and e-gasoline for exportation to Europe.
