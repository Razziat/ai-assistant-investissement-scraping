"Digital transformation: above all, a human odyssey - Air Liquide","Fri, 28 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi9kaWdpdGFsLXRyYW5zZm9ybWF0aW9uLWFib3ZlLWFsbC1odW1hbi1vZHlzc2V50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As the digital revolution transforms every business sector, including industry 4.0, robotics and artificial intelligence, Air Liquide offers a people-centric approach that places new technology at the heart of its digital transformation. The result is improved performance, along with an enhanced customer and employee experience.

Digital transformation has become inevitable for industry. New technologies such as big data, the Internet of Things, cloud computing and artificial intelligence are entering every sector of activity. By 2024, the global market for industry 4.0 could represent 155 billion dollars, compared to 66 billion dollars in 20171. New uses are proliferating, the rate of change is accelerating and industrial customers are adopting the same habits as consumers in daily life, especially when it comes to responsiveness and an increasingly seamless, enhanced and personalized experience. Air Liquide serves more than 2 million industrial customers in nearly every sector of the economy: food and pharmaceuticals, steel production, energy, chemicals, automotive manufacturing, aeronautics, etc. At the heart of these very diverse markets, the Group is in a prime position to observe and detect new needs and uses at the source. This very close proximity, combined with a large number of customers, field employees and assets (plants, facilities, cylinders, etc.), offers an ideal playground for developing new solutions focused on the customer and employee experience. Seen very early on as a remarkable performance driver, digital technology is now increasingly integrated into the Group’s services and working methods. In just a few years, this transformation has occurred at every level of the organization: manufacturing, logistics, traceability, operational performance, on-site and truck safety, a simplified employee experience with a single online work platform, and more...

“ Our greatest strength is believing that digitization doesn’t just mean implementing technology. It’s about putting people first. Upstream, that means creating brand-new services and products based on an in-depth observation of our customers’ issues. And downstream, we transform our organization to continually make it more agile, by engaging our employees and developing new skills. ” Olivier Delabroy Vice President Packaged Gases at Air Liquide’s Industrial Merchant business line

The infinite potential of digital technology serving our operations

Digital technology represents a vast source of solutions for managing the Group’s assets more effectively. The Smart & Innovative Operations (SIO) program is a prime example: control centers remotely adapt production at the Group’s plants to improve reliability – especially with predictive maintenance - and optimize energy consumption.







The objective is to respond more effectively in real time to customers’ varying supply needs. Launched in France in 2015, the SIO program is now deployed in Europe, the United States, Asia Pacific and the Middle East. At the end of 2019, Air Liquide inaugurated its first automated order preparation system at the gas cylinder packaging plant in Feyzin, France. This offers numerous benefits: increased operational efficiency, a clear improvement in the quality of service provided to customers, and reduced handling by operators.







This technological progress would not have been possible without the involvement of plant operators during the earliest project phases and cross-functional teams during the design and digitization phases.

New ways of working —The successful deployment of new technologies depends largely on users’ (customers’ or employees’) ability to adopt them. The Group is committed to developing a digital culture as well as internal expertise, and this transformation involves new, more collaborative and cross-functional working styles. This was the spirit behind the creation of our Digital Fabs in 2016. Focusing on a business line or function, these fabs bring together diverse teams from Air Liquide operations, business lines and R&D, as well as digital/IT experts: developers, data scientists, designers and user research specialists. This latter resource enables Air Liquide to further its understanding of customers’ and employees’ needs and behaviors (user journey, qualitative studies, etc.) to maximize the adoption of new technologies for a continually enhanced experience.

Co-building with customers

Launched in 2019, Qlixbi was designed with and for welders through co-building workshops in their work environment. Combining an easier-to-use new generation gas cylinder and a range of digital services, this solution is revolutionizing the welding business.







It is a real boon for welders, who work in a competitive market and need to manage numerous constraints, including gas supplies. With Qlixbi, they receive a cutting-edge connector to link their welding station and gas cylinder in a single click.







Continuous supply is ensured by connected services that enable the user to monitor their gas reserves online and automatically replenish supplies, while facilitating collaboration between workshop teams.

Another example of technology that serves people is “cobots” or collaborative robots that help operators perform tasks. This is the case of BotX Welder, a solution co-developed by Air Liquide’s U.S. subsidiary Airgas and its Red-D-Arc branch, the Innovation Campus Delaware and start-ups Hirebotics and Universal Robots. Designed using welder expertise, this cobot is programmed to carry out a wide range of welding operations to industry standards. As a workshop assistant, BotX Welder is a flexible way to compensate for a shortage of labor in the welding market."

Air Liquide has completed a major revamp at its hydrogen filling station located in Zaventem, Belgium, with new filling curves, an infrared communication system, and upgraded cooling capacity, reports H2 View.

New curves will allow most recent hydrogen vehicles to refuel at the site in accordance with current regulations in place. The infrared communication system will help determine which vehicle is at the pump, as well as the contents, pressure and temperature in the tank.

“The cooling capacity of the gas station has also changed,"" explains Diederick Luijten, Vice-President Hydrogen Energy NWE & CIS Countries at Air Liquide. “This allows us to fill vehicles with controlled cooled hydrogen, which speeds up the filling process. Finally, this technique also has the particularly of consuming much less electricity, which is better for the environment.”

The station will in the coming weeks connect to the European Hydrogen Refuelling Station Availability System (E-HRS-AS), a European project dedicated to raise the online visibility of hydrogen stations.

Steel Dynamics expects openings at its $1.9B steel mill plant in Sinton

Show Caption Hide Caption Steel Dynamics mill could come to South Texas Steel Dynamics mill could come to South Texas Courtney Sacco, Corpus Christi Caller-Times

Steel Dynamics, Inc., which is building a $1.9 billion steel mill near Sinton, is rolling out the welcome mat for job seekers.

An ""open application"" event will be 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Aug. 15, and noon to 5 p.m. Aug. 16, at the Sinton Community Center, 1301 E. Sinton St.

The plant is expected to eventually produce 3 million tons of steel each year and is anticipated to create at least 600 permanent, high-paying jobs. The Sinton campus will be the Fort Wayne, Indiana company's first west of the Mississippi River, according to a Steel Dynamics news release.

The company needs to start hiring for the site by the end of the year. It has about 75 employees on site now and is in need of about 300 to 350 more by 2021. Steel Dynamics should have about 650 employees on site by mid-2021.

“We need some positions filled immediately and some others not until a year from now, but this is where we would pull those people -- from these applications,” said Glenn A. Pushis, the company’s senior vice president for special projects.

The two-day application event is not a hiring event, and there will be no interviews conducted, according to the news release.

Residential growth

""Within a five-year period, we should see ... maybe 600 to 800 people working at the Steel Dynamics facility -- potentially over 1,000 other workers there related to customers and supply chain operations,"" said Iain Vasey, president/CEO of the Corpus Christi Regional Economic Development Corp.

""We could see potentially close to 2,000 jobs at the Steel Dynamics campus.""

That, in turn, will have a residential growth effect on Sinton and Odem, as well as the Corpus Christi neighborhood of Calallen, Vasey said. Steel Dynamics will also bring roughly 10 other steel and manufacturing companies to the area.

""We've seen a lot of interest from potential employees or employees within the Steel Dynamics system wanting to move to the entire (Highway) 77 corridor,"" he said. ""It's going to spur a lot of growth in terms of retail and services in both Calallen and Sinton.""

A long-time Calallen family, the Walkers, are working with the city of Corpus Christi to build 408-411 conventional brick houses to roughly 117 acres in Calallen off U.S. Highway 77 and County Road 48.

As employment growth of the Steel Dynamics campus ramps up, the CCREDC expects more than 100 homes a year could be acquired by the plant's employees.

The corporation also projects Corpus Christi as a whole needs 2,000 to 4,000 more residential units a year to come online.

Corpus Christi City Manager Peter Zanoni has said this subdivision, to be called The Reserve at Calallen South, will help meet the housing need for Steel Dynamics employees and also help combat a local housing shortage.

Vision Automobiles Paris is a name that may not ring any bells, but the up-and-coming automaker promises to redeem the French hypercar with a very different animal from the Chiron and subsequent models. Named after the French Revolution of 1789, the 1789 will feature an engine that runs on biomethane. The configuration, displacement, and output figures are not known at this moment, but that’s more than enough to understand why this fellow is a trailblazing car.“In the current context of energy transition, we are convinced that we have smart alternatives to fossil fuels and electricity right in front of us,” explain the creators of the mid-engine interloper. In terms of development, Vision is counting on WRTI for much-needed help with the powerplant, transmission, and other hardware.Welter Recherche Technologie Industrie is the brainchild of Gerard Welter, a French designer who worked for Peugeot between 1998 and 2007. Some of his creations include the 304, the 604, 305, 405, and 406 Coupe, along with the 205 hatchback. This guy also built sports prototypes such as the WM P88 that reached 407 km/h at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1988 thanks to an 850-horsepower V6 engine.About the alternative to fossil fuel mentioned a little earlier, the biomethane will be stored in a tank behind the occupants in either liquid or gaseous form. For racing, liquid is the preferred option because it’s less heavy and less cumbersome.“The average age at Vision is 26” according to the French startup, and the lineup includes racing drivers Matthieu Vaxiviere and Paul-Loup Chatin. The renderings in the photo gallery come four years after the birth of the project, and with a bit of luck, we may be treated to the real deal in just as many years."
Neste and Air bp to boost sustainable aviation fuel in Europe - PetrolPlaza.com,"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiJmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBldHJvbHBsYXphLmNvbS9uZXdzLzI1Mzkw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Neste and Air bp to boost sustainable aviation fuel in Europe

Air bp and Neste agree to offer a five-fold increase in volume of sustainable aviation fuel.

Last update: August 21, 2020

Neste, the world’s largest producer of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) produced from waste and residue raw materials and Air bp have signed an agreement to offer an increased volume of sustainable aviation fuel to airport customers in 2020 and 2021.

The volume is five times larger than that supplied by the businesses in 2019. Air bp will make the Neste-produced SAF available at selected airports in Europe, with deliveries to airports including Stockholm (ARN) and Oslo (OSL) expected to begin in the coming weeks.

The increased supply of SAF comes in response to rising demand from existing and new airline customers, as well as from Norway, where there is a mandate requiring 0.5% of all jet fuel sold to be SAF.

“bp’s ambition is to be a net zero company by 2050 or sooner and to help the world get to net zero. Air bp aims to support our customers and the wider aviation industry on their path to meet their low carbon goals. We believe sustainable aviation fuel will play an important role as the industry recovers from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Through our successful ongoing collaboration with Neste, we are pleased to be able to offer our customers a substantially increased volume of SAF as they work towards reducing their emissions”, says Martin Thomsen, Air bp’s chief executive officer.

Neste’s sustainable aviation fuel annual capacity is currently 100,000 tons. With their Singapore refinery expansion on the way, and with possible additional investment into their Rotterdam refinery, Neste will have the capacity to produce some 1.5 million tons of SAF annually by 2023.

Lizeth Kruger, national clinic manager, Dis-Chem

The other two are more directly related to her field, namely the important role nursing practitioners play in global pandemic and to keep up to date with new clinical data daily.

Kruger has 25 years’ experience in primary healthcare nursing and managing primary healthcare clinics. ""I was working on the Phelophepa health train in my 4th and final year of study and loved it. I realised that primary healthcare is my passion and where I wanted to focus my career.""

In her role as national clinic manager, Kruger oversees Dis-Chem's 358 registered nursing practitioners, the clinic call centre and now the Covid-19 testing sites. she describes her typical work day as ""never the same!"". Her day usually starts before 6am with the nursing practitioners’ queries, before moving on to tasks such as confirming that all 300 clinics operational, relocating nurses were needed, planning clinic campaigns, meetings with stakeholders, the Dis-Chem team and executive managers, managing stock levels in clinics and planning and managing new clinics, among other things.

Never give up

One of the knock-on effects of the pandemic is the drop off of other primary healthcare (PHC) services. ""Immunisation services dropped by almost 30%. We are waiting for other disease outbreaks, this is probably the biggest challenge in PHC world.

""Patients are really stressed due to finances and uncertain times. This manifests in increased verbal abuse to our nursing practitioners so it’s really important, yet challenging, to keep them positive and focused,"" Kruger says.

The advice she would give young women wanting to enter the nursing field is to never give up. ""It is so clichéd, but get up every morning and say: 'I can make a difference'. Show what you are worth, don’t always shout. People will have much more respect if they can see what you do. Work hard every day.""

Kruger has been married for almost 25 years and has two teenage children. To relax, she says she loves to go to jog, not in the gym but in open air. ""It clears my head. I’ve trained my bull terrier to run eight to 10 kms with me and she is already seven years old. I adore her! She brings some sanity to my life in the way only dogs can."""

The company had posted a net profit of ₹ 21.56 crore in the same quarter a year ago.

Total income during the quarter stood at ₹ 501.54 crore. It was at ₹ 2,082.97 crore in the year-ago period.

The June quarter has been one of the most challenging quarters for the company and for the overall Indian apparel industry, ABFRL said.

The operations of the company were severely impacted due to the unprecedented economic standstill induced by the pandemic.

During April and May, most of the retail network was closed, while e-commerce sales too restarted only in the third week of May, when the restrictions on non-essential products were lifted, the company said.

“Stores started to open during the month of June, although operational hours were restricted in many places which slowed down the return to normalcy. By the end of June, nearly 80 per cent of our network had re-opened. The results of this quarter should be seen in the above context,” it said.

As the pandemic struck, the company embarked on a series of cost reduction initiatives including renegotiating rentals at stores, offices, and warehouses, cutting discretionary costs along with curtailing overhead expenses.

The company said it managed to bring down costs by more than ₹ 450 crore over the previous quarter, on account of these measures.

The company added that it is confident of consistent improvement in business performance over the next two quarters and expects to achieve full normalcy by the fourth quarter of FY21.

Shares of Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail closed 9.44 per cent higher at ₹ 129.90 apiece on BSE."

The over E200 million investment by Kellogg Tolaram will inject over E6 billion into Eswatini’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) over the next 10 years.

This sum includes monies that will be spent by the company on raw material expansion, Value Added Tax (VAT) on consumption and fuel tax ,among other operational costs. This was disclosed by Minister of Commerce, Industry and Trade Manqoba Khumalo during an investment update meeting convened at the Hilton Garden Inn yesterday. Khumalo explained the benefits to the Eswatini economy, as he justified why it made financial sense for government to erect a factory valued at E220 million from which the company would operate from.

“I am pleased to announce that we expect the project to be commissioned by mid-December 2020. There are massive economic benefits that will be reaped by the kingdom from establishment of Kellogg Tolaram Eswatini,” said Khumalo.

Impressed

The minister said he was impressed with the great progress made in terms of establishing the Kellogg Tolaram noodles factory in the Kingdom of Eswatini. He mentioned that equipment to value of nearly E200 million was ready to be installed at the factory.

Khumalo mentioned that Kellogg’s was already hiring; having recently advertised a total of 27 professional posts. He explained that the project would bring an estimated 200 direct jobs and 70 indirect jobs in the first phase, and this number could increase with the expansion of the investment. Khumalo pointed out that the Kellogg’s project would not only bring employment opportunities but could further contribute to the development of the local supply chain; as they would be sourcing their raw materials, to every extent possible, locally.

“Moreover, it will also result in skills and technological capabilities transfer, while improving the kingdom’s competitive environment. We expect a number of small enterprises to be born from this project, particularly within MSMEs, including in the transport and logistics sector,” said. Khumalo explained that the investment also has the potential to spur enterprise development, including the achievement of synergies within local suppliers and the development of new activities. “Kellogg Tolaram will invest significant resources behind research and development activity, while the project and operation will create the opportunity to generate considerable technological spillovers to the benefit of local industry,” Khumalo explained. As a further indirect benefit, Khumalo said the Kellogg’s project would greatly assist economic development through spurring domestic competition and thereby leading to higher productivity, lower prices and more efficient resource allocation, all of which would be in the interest of the consumer. In 2019, government unveiled investments and re-investments to the value of over E1.3 billion; which would bring an estimated 5 000 jobs at full scale.

These investments came from conglomerates and large corporations such as Jonsson Workwear, RME Bullion, Air Liquide (expansion), Avapharm and Clockwork Giant Clothing (expansion), among others.

Sasol ends torrid financial year with a R91 billion loss | Business - News24,"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MyNC5jb20vZmluMjQvY29tcGFuaWVzL3Nhc29sLWVuZHMtdG9ycmlkLWZpbmFuY2lhbC15ZWFyLXdpdGgtYS1yOTEtYmlsbGlvbi1sb3NzLTIwMjAwODE30gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The petrochemical group says 'unprecedented low oil prices' and impairments of R111.6 billion resulted in a loss of R91.3 billion.

The group expects global oil prices to remain low for up to 18 months.

The company's total debt has increased to R189.7 billion.

Sasol has ended a turbulent year with a loss of R91.3 billion.



The petrochemical group's year to end June was marked by a sharp fall in oil prices which significantly slashed its market capitalisation. Last week it warned of R112 billion in writedowns, which exceeded its market capitalisation.

The financial results paint a devastating picture of the impact of international oil price fluctuations and Covid-19 on the group's operations, in what is likely to add to the unease of investors. Sasol's shares fell 4% in early trade on Monday.

""The combined effects of unprecedented low oil prices, destruction of demand for products and impairments of R111.6 billion resulted in a loss of R91.3 billion for the year compared to earnings of R6.1 billion in the prior year,"" the company said

""We expect that oil prices will remain low for the next 12 to 18 months as the impact of COVID-19 becomes better understood.""

Headline earnings per share tanked by more than 100% to a -R11.79 loss per share, compared to R30.72 in the prior year.

The gross margins of the group's energy business, meanwhile, slumped by 38%.

To mitigate the impact of the losses on the balance sheet, the company said it had engaged its lenders to waive its loan covenants as at 30 June 2020 from 3 times to 4 times of net debt. Sasol's first significant debt, due next year, was $1 billion in loans.

The company's total debt, largely denominated in US dollars, increased to R189.7 billion, from R130.9 billion in the previous year.

It also stated that it had secured $1 billion syndicated loan facility for up to 18 months to enhance its US dollar liquidity position during the peak gearing phase as its Lake Charles Chemicals Project ramps up.

The financing of the Chemicals Project has contributed to earnings losses, with an additional R6 billion going into finance charges as the project started operating.

The Johannesburg headquartered company has embarked on a process of offloading assets, in a bid to stabilise its balance sheet, including a proposal to sell Secunda's air separation units to Air Liquide for R8.5 billion."
