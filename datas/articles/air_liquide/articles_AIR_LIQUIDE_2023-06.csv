The Group will supply hydrogen of renewable origin to power some of the vehicles of Paris 2024’s official fleet. This partnership reflects Paris 2024’s ambition to “organize more sustainable Games”.

In keeping with the event’s environmental ambitions, Air Liquide and the Paris 2024 Organizing Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Games have signed a partnership to supply hydrogen for vehicles transporting athletes and officials. Several hundred hydrogen-powered Toyota Mirai, the official vehicle of Paris 2024, will be filled with hydrogen supplied by Air Liquide. This hydrogen will be of renewable origin, meaning that it will be produced from water electrolysis or biomethane with guarantees of origin.

Given that transport accounts for a quarter (24%1) of global CO2 emissions, the climate emergency requires a range of solutions, including hydrogen of renewable origin. It offers real advantages, including a great range and minimal charging times, for heavy and intensive transport, like taxis and the vehicles in Paris 2024’s official fleet that will be in continuous use.

As a world leader in hydrogen production, Air Liquide will draw on the expertise it has developed over 60 years and its low-carbon and renewable hydrogen production capacities. The Group is currently launching, piloting and developing some of the most important projects around the world to decarbonize industry and transport. To accelerate the development of hydrogen as part of the energy transition, Air Liquide has committed to developing a total installed electrolysis capacity of 3 gigawatts by 2030.

Tony Estanguet, President of Paris 2024, explains:

To ensure that we achieve our goal of making these Games more sustainable in response to climate change, we've rethought all the major features of the Games. By supplying hydrogen of renewable origin for the vehicles for athletes and officials, Air Liquide will help us reduce the carbon footprint of the Games. Thanks, Air Liquide, for your commitment as an Official Supporter of Paris 2024. We’re thrilled to have you on board!

François Jackow, Chief Executive Officer of the Air Liquide Group, adds:

Air Liquide and Paris 2024 share the same ambition: implementing concrete solutions to meet the challenge of climate change. That's what our partnership is all about. Beyond the Olympic and Paralympic Games Paris 2024, this partnership will accelerate the wide-scale adoption of hydrogen to decarbonize heavy and intensive transport, including taxis. The challenge is huge, and it is only by working together that we will succeed!

Air Liquide’s contribution to the Olympic and Paralympic Games Paris 2024 in brief:

Air Liquide will supply the hydrogen for some of the vehicles in Paris 2024’s official fleet - several hundred hydrogen-powered Toyota Mirai cars.

Air Liquide signs PPA to produce renewable hydrogen - ICIS,"Thu, 15 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmljaXMuY29tL2V4cGxvcmUvcmVzb3VyY2VzL25ld3MvMjAyMy8wNi8xNS8xMDg5NjQ3Mi9haXItbGlxdWlkZS1zaWducy1wcGEtdG8tcHJvZHVjZS1yZW5ld2FibGUtaHlkcm9nZW7SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON (ICIS)–French industrial gases firm Air Liquide said on 15 June it had signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) with European energy company Statkraft to enable wind power to run its electrolysis plant in Oberhausen in the west of Germany. The agreement outlines a future market development path for hydrogen following the publication of the delegated act on renewable fuels of non-biological origin.

Under the PPA, electricity from Statkraft’s portfolio of onshore wind farms in Germany is expected to supply Air Liquide’s electrolyser for three years from 2024. The contracted capacity is 45MW.

The electrolysis plant, named ‘Trailblazer’, is expected to start operations by the end of 2023 with 20MW capacity, which could at a later stage be expanded to 30MW.

A Statkraft spokesperson said the output of the hydrogen plant is approximately 2,900 tonnes of renewable hydrogen per year.

The electrolyser will be integrated into the existing infrastructure of Air Liquide on the Rhine and Ruhr rivers to provide key industrial and transport consumers with renewable hydrogen and oxygen.

According to ICIS Analytics, Statkraft is among Europe’s largest sellers of PPAs with 2.2GW in its books.

Furthermore, Statkraft trading and origination vice president Sascha Schroder said this was the firm’s first green PPA to produce hydrogen, emphasising the importance of the conversion of industrial processes that could sustainably reduce emissions in Germany in the long run.

PPA MARKET DEVELOPMENT

The signing of a PPA from an industrial gases producer specifically for hydrogen production marks a new and growing area of market growth for PPAs.

Speaking to ICIS, Rommero Carrillo, director of business development at PPA reference price provider Pexapark, noted that currently the PPA market consists of “utility offtakers, corporates seeking to meet ESG requirements, and large industrials seeking to price hedge for power.

“We see PtX [power-to-X, a term for technologies that convert power into low-carbon synthetic fuels] become the fourth pillar of PPA offtakers.”

Carrillo explained that electrolyser operators would drive the PPA market forward, “which is currently dominated by corporates, followed by utility offtakers.” When speaking on the type of PPA product that electrolyser operators would seek to use, Carrillo said “the flexible nature of electrolysers means they can manage profile risk, hence they will be driving pay-as-produced (PAP) PPA structures”.

By opting for PAP products, electrolyser operators would be able to “provide a level of support to the cannibalisation that we have been seeing in the market affecting solar in Spain and Germany, and wind in the Nordics,” Carrillo said.

HYDROGEN REGULATION, PPAs

PPAs are key to multiple components of regulation for hydrogen producers in Europe, provided they wish to secure subsidy support or wish to claim their hydrogen to be “renewable” according to the conditions set out by EU legislators.

Carrillo noted that the use of a three-year PPA shows the infancy of the hydrogen market, saying that long-term PPAs may be more likely in the future: “This will be especially true for projects that have project finance by a lender and who seek to meet delegated act requirements beyond 2030,” he said.

As well as this, initial information regarding the EU Hydrogen Bank also indicated a requirement for long-term PPAs, Carrillo said. The Hydrogen Bank aims to provide a fixed subsidy over a 10-year period, prioritising the lowest bidder via auction format."

Why settle on the Moon? - Air Liquide,"Thu, 29 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpcXVpZGUuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvc2hhcmVob2xkaW5nL3doeS1zZXR0bGUtbW9vbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Europe could help create a lasting base on the Moon before the end of the decade. This is a unique opportunity for the industry and a chance to develop sustainable innovations for the benefit of all humankind. What role can Air Liquide play in this?

The space sector has been in a constant state of transformation for the past 20 years. Space has become a huge part of our daily lives. An individual may use as many as 40 satellites a day for things like GPS tracking, the weather and communication. Everything has changed. Everything, that is, except how we use space from Earth. Space missions are one-way and there is an ever-growing amount of debris in orbit, which could in the future jeopardize the space services that we on Earth currently enjoy.

Today marks the dawn of a new era, one of sustainable space exploration. And Air Liquide is in the perfect position to usher it in. As an industry player, we believe that gas and cryogenics will be key to any lasting human presence in space and will prove useful in developing Europe’s interdisciplinary space services that the world will one day need.

This inauguration marks a step forward in the two companies’ commitment to the development of hydrogen mobility in Europe, in line with the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in December 2021. The MoU aims to advance hydrogen as a crucial enabler for the energy transition of the transport industry by leveraging the unique expertise of Air Liquide across the entire hydrogen value chain, from production and storage to distribution, and the know-how of IVECO, the commercial vehicle brand of Iveco Group, a pioneer in the manufacturing of vehicles powered by alternative fuels.

Guests at the inauguration that took place on June 26, 2023 had the opportunity to visit the large-capacity high-pressure station (1 ton/day) supplied with low-carbon hydrogen via pipeline, and to see first-hand a prototype of an IVECO heavy-duty fuel cell truck. This transport solution for long haulage features a fast refuelling time at 700-bar pressure.

The Fos-sur-Mer station is part of the HyAMMED (“Hydrogène à Aix-Marseille pour une Mobilité Ecologique et Durable”) project supported by French funding. The new station is also part of H2Haul, the European project co-financed by the Clean Hydrogen Partnership. Air Liquide and IVECO were among the first partners of the H2Haul project when it was launched in 2019. A second high-capacity station (700 bar, 2 tons/day) dedicated to heavy vehicles will be installed in Salon-de-Provence to supply a potential fleet of 50 hydrogen IVECO trucks from 2025 in the framework of the R’HySE project.

Erwin Penfornis, Vice-President Hydrogen Energy World Business Line, Air Liquide, said

To encourage the widespread use of hydrogen, we must collectively create the conditions for the sector to flourish. It is imperative to develop a network of high-capacity stations dense enough to enable vehicle manufacturers and transport operators to embark on this transition. The HyAMMED project is part of this approach: it's a decisive first step and the kick-off to a greater ambition that we share with our partner IVECO.

Gerrit Marx, CEO, Iveco Group, affirmed

Our strategy for increasingly sustainable mobility is based on a technology-neutral approach and hydrogen mobility is a key building block on this path. In fact, it provides an essential solution for high energy demanding commercial vehicle applications, such as long-haul transport. Today we showed that we have all the capabilities, both the vehicles and the stations, to put a true hydrogen mobility ecosystem on the road: the strategy is becoming reality. And our new, all-inclusive, pay-per-use rental model GATE - Green & Advanced Transport Ecosystem will enable access to the hydrogen-powered vehicles. Today’s milestone allows us to further strengthen the strategic and fundamental partnership with Air Liquide, a leader on the international energy transition scene that, like Iveco Group, works to advance a more sustainable society.

The HyAMMED project, part of the H2Haul program (Hydrogen fuel cell trucks for heavy-duty, zero emission logistics), has received funding from the Clean Hydrogen Partnership under grant agreement no. 826236. This public-private partnership is supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program, Hydrogen Europe and Hydrogen Europe Research.

Air Liquide will have a stand at this event’s 7th edition and will also organize various conferences to promote its innovative technological solutions in low-carbon hydrogen, healthcare, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) while showcasing its presence in South Korea. Emilie Mouren-Renouard, member of the Executive Committee in charge of Innovation, answers our 3 questions.

Why is it important for Air Liquide to attend Viva Technology?

Viva Technology is Europe’s leading tech event. As we all know, innovation and technologies are a driving force of ADVANCE, contributing to all its strategic pillars.

It’s an opportunity to present the Group’s latest innovations to our customers and our partners and increase our attractiveness. At VivaTech, we can learn more about the most cutting-edge technologies, particularly digital technologies and AI, and meet with some of the most talented people in tech. This event is also an opportunity to highlight some of the Group’s innovative partners, from industrial players like STMicroelectronics and Siemens Energy to the start-ups we work with to co-develop solutions for our customers and patients.

That’s what we want to know: what will Air Liquide present at VivaTech this year?

As a champion of climate solutions, we’re going to present innovations that contribute to the decarbonization of industry and mobility, focused particularly on low-carbon hydrogen. At our stand, visitors can use virtual reality to explore the Group’s electrolyzers that will produce renewable hydrogen: our new electrolyzer in Germany will be operational in 2023 while Normand’hy in France will start production in 2026. This year, we’re also going to showcase our carbon capture and storage technologies, including Cryocap™, whose interest continues to grow among industrial companies, and 44.01, a start-up supported by ALIAD, our venture capital fund, which is developing a new technology for sequestration of CO 2 through carbon mineralization.

VivaTech is also known for its commitment to diversity and inclusion. What does that mean to Air Liquide?

For several years now, VivaTech has supported women in tech and has helped girls and young women to learn about roles in digital and new technologies. Air Liquide shares the same commitment: we’re aiming for 35% female engineers and managers by 2025, because diversity boosts creativity and ultimately innovation. That’s why we’re taking part in several roundtables and female employees from our Innovation teams will present their various roles, thereby making the most of an opportunity to attract and retain talented employees.

We’ve also offered tickets for Saturday to employees who want to attend with girls (and boys) so that they can find out more about new technologies and maybe even be inspired to choose their future career!"
Air Liquide reaffirms its support for China's carbon neutrality plans - SHINE News,"Sun, 11 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNoaW5lLmNuL2Jpei9jb21wYW55LzIzMDYxMTY2NTEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide remains supportive of China's commitment to carbon neutrality and has taken steps to reduce CO2 emissions with its new strategic plan, ADVANCE till 2025.

Air Liquide stated that it remains steadfast and supportive of China's commitment to carbon neutrality and that it sees new potential in a variety of industries as economic development shifts toward high-quality development.

Air Liquide, a world leader in gases, technology, and services for industry and health, feels it is uniquely positioned to support China's ambition with shared aims and distinctive solutions in those disciplines, Nicolas Poirot, President & CEO of Air Liquide China, told Shanghai Daily in an interview.

""China is the largest consumer market and one of the top three markets for Air Liquide. We continue to see the Chinese market expanding and the Chinese people's increasing demand for higher-quality goods, services, and the environment,"" he said.

Air Liquide has taken three approaches to reduce CO2 emissions: decarbonize its own assets through CO2 capture, low-carbon hydrogen production, and energy efficiency; offer low-carbon solutions to help customers reduce their CO2 footprint; and, finally, accelerate hydrogen development.

According to its new strategic plan till 2025, ADVANCE, Air Liquide Group has set the goal of starting to reduce its CO2 emissions in absolute terms around 2025, lowering emissions by a third by 2035, and reaching carbon neutrality by 2050.

Air Liquide has been actively procuring renewable energy to decarbonize its plants across China for several years.

It intends to install rooftop PV panels at its China operations over the next three years, with the goal of reducing CO2 emissions by more than 5,000 tons per year.

A total of 1,200 GWh of low-carbon electricity is scheduled to be procured this year, representing a 120 percent increase over 2020.

It also aspires to be a significant enabler of the hydrogen society through the use of its assets, technologies, and expertise.

Poirot said hydrogen is a cornerstone for China's energy revolution and provides the company with significant growth potential as a competitive low-carbon solution for various applications in the industrial, energy, and mobility sectors.

Air Liquide has a diverse portfolio of technology solutions and services to meet the growing demand for energy-efficient technologies and smart solutions from local customers, including the supply of low-carbon gases, CO2 capture and management, and solutions to transform the customers' industrial processes.

In terms of circular economy and effective waste management, Air Liquide's biogas plant in Huai'an, Jiangsu Province, is likewise a trailblazer.

The unit, which has a total annual capacity of 75 GWh, generates biogas from agricultural and livestock waste and purifies it into biomethane. This is then pumped into the city's gas grid and generates power. The digestate is processed into biofertilizer for local consumption.

Air Liquide is planning a slew of new investments, particularly in fields such as energy transition, electronics, high-tech, and medical care.

In the field of energy transition, Air Liquide intends to further promote the development of the entire industrial chain of the local hydrogen energy industry, actively share Air Liquide's leading expertise in low-carbon hydrogen production, transportation, and storage technologies, and support local new forces in clean mobility.

Shanghai Chemical Industry Park Industrial Gases Co Ltd, an Air Liquide subsidiary, invested more than 200 million euros in Shanghai Chemical Industry Park to establish two hydrogen production units and related infrastructure.

These units will generate H2 and CO for chemical firms in the park, as well as mobility and other industrial and electronics customers in the Yangtze River Delta.

Another subsidiary, Air Liquide Yongli (Tianjin), has invested approximately 60 million euros to electrify its two ASUs, which are currently powered by third-party coal-based steam, which could avoid 370,000 tons of CO2 emissions per year. That is equivalent to the electricity-related carbon emissions of 1 million Chinese households.

It will also engage with the local electronics supply chain, particularly in the Yangtze River Delta and the Greater Bay Area, and provide advanced semiconductor manufacturers with the necessary precursors.

In terms of high-tech innovation, it will continue to increase exchanges with major technology sectors such as nuclear fusion, aerospace, biological sample storage, gene banking, and energy shipping, as well as seek partnership prospects.

The stability of the medical oxygen supply chain will be strengthened further in the field of medical care. It also seeks to develop home healthcare services and provide customized and exclusive services for Chinese patients with chronic respiratory diseases, in order to create clinical and economic value.

An active participant at the Shanghai Carbon Neutrality Expo, which opened today and is scheduled to run through June 14, Air Liquide said it is also seeking partnerships with companies that have a shared vision and commitment to sustainability and ESG principles, which will lay the groundwork for long-term collaboration.

Air Liquide will showcase a number of recent innovations, including the indoor vertical farming system, developed in partnership with the German business &ever, which has begun to be used in agricultural production, where it can help crops absorb CO2 and enhance productivity.

On seeking local partnerships, Poirot said that ""local experience, innovative technologies, solutions, business models, market access, or particular industry knowledge are vital.""

This could hasten the development and deployment of sustainable technologies while also stimulating innovation in line with China's green development goals."

The aptly named French-Canadian company Flying Whales is building the largest aircraft in the world dedicated solely to cargo transportation. With no passengers on board, their airships promise to revolutionize the logistics industry and open up new possibilities for accessing remote locations.

Flying Whales has been working on this ambitious project for the past ten years, and they are now reaching the culmination of the engineering phase. Soon, they will transition into the industrial phase, bringing their vision to life.

The company is now making preparations to build the first final assembly line near Bordeaux, in the southwest of France. Additionally, a second final assembly line is planned in Quebec, as the government of the Canadian province is a shareholder in the company. Furthermore, Flying Whales is actively searching for a third location in the Asia Pacific region to establish another factory.

The financial investment required for such an ambitious undertaking is substantial. For their French facility alone, Flying Whales estimates an investment of approximately 100 million euros. To fund the project, they have secured support from a diverse range of sources. Public actors, including the governments of France, Monaco and Quebec have contributed, along with private partners such as DP, Air Liquide and a prominent French engineering group.

One question that inevitably arises when discussing airships is the choice of lifting gas. In the case of Flying Whales, the answer is helium, an inert gas that poses no safety concerns. Helium provides the necessary lift to keep these colossal airships airborne for extended periods.

But who are the potential customers for Flying Whales’ airships? The company has signed approximately 40 pre-agreements and commercial agreements with various players in different sectors. Among their collaborators are bodies from the wood and wind energy industries, where Flying Whales’ airships will be instrumental in transporting wind blades.

President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev met with Claudio Descalzi, CEO of Italian energy company Eni, to discuss the company’s activities and decarbonization initiatives in the country, reported the Akorda.

Following the meeting, Eni and KazMunayGas (KMG), the national operator of the oil and gas industry of Kazakhstan, announced plans to launch a joint 250-megawatt Hybrid Renewables-Gas Power Plant project in Zhanaozen in the Mangystau Region.

“The project, which is the first-of-its-kind in the country, comprises a solar power plant, a wind power plant and a gas power plant for the production and supply of low-carbon and stable electricity to KMG subsidiaries in the area,” reads the ENI’s release.

Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and CEO of French energy and petroleum company TotalEnergies, and Almasadam Satkaliyev, Kazakh Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, signed an agreement to build a 1-gigawatt onshore wind farm and a 600-megawatt battery energy storage system in the Zhambyl Region. It is expected to be the largest renewable energy project generating 15% of electricity from renewable sources by 2030.

“The will, the human and economic resources are there, and the technology is advancing by leaps and bounds. All of this should encourage us collectively to go even further to support electrification and ramp up renewable energy. Of course, we can’t do it on our own: Political leaders and economic players need to create the right conditions that match ambitious goals. We also need policies that are built for the long run, if we want to meet climate expectations, support changes in usage – and offer our customers energy at the best price,” wrote Pouyanné on LinkedIn.

Additionally, Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic agreed to establish an industrial trade and logistics hub at the border checkpoints to speed up cargo delivery and reduce logistics costs.

“It is a further step in the development of our economic and good neighborly relations. It is a huge breakthrough for businesses in Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic,” said Kazakh Deputy Prime Minister – Minister of Trade and Integration Serik Zhumangarin.

Zhumangarin also met with Parviz Shahbazov, Minister of Energy of Azerbaijan, as Kazakhstan seeks to increase oil exports via the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline and set a consistent tariff for cargo going through the Trans-Caspian corridor.

The trade turnover between Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan grew by 39 percent, reaching $461.9 million in 2022. The trade turnover increased by 37.4% to $183.8 million in the first four months of 2023.

Kazakhstan is also interested in increasing its export of approximately 60 types of goods worth $250 million to Qatar. Direct flights between the two countries are also expected to launch.

Officials from the Ministry of Energy and the Samruk-Kazyna Sovereign Wealth Fund, an investment holding, adopted an action plan to construct a one-gigawatt wind farm with an electricity storage system in the Zhambyl Region with China Power International Holding. The holding is a subsidiary of the State Power Investment Corporation, one of China’s five largest power-generating companies.

Furthermore, Pavlodar Petrochemical Plant and Air Liquide Munay Tech Gases agreed to build a hydrogen production unit. The facility will produce winter diesel fuel with a capacity of 160,000 tons annually. The project is estimated at 80 million euros ($86 million).

Air Liquide Munay Tech Gases is a joint company between France’s Air Liquide and KMG established in 2016. Since 2018, the company has operated the Pavlodar Petrochemical Plant’s hydrogen and nitrogen production units.

Lastly, the Belgian airline company, Challenges Airlines, plans to open a technical center at the airport in Astana. The CEO of Challenges Airlines, Eshel Heffetz, discussed cargo flights and aircraft feasibility with Chairman of the Committee of Civil Aviation, Talgat Lastayev."

Hosted by CINEA’s Acting Director Paloma Aba Garrote, the signatory event was attended by the Minister-President of Flanders Jan Jambon, the Head of the Belgian Representation of the European Commission Stefaan De Rynck and the project beneficiaries.

The Antwerp@C CO2 Export Hub project is carried out by Air Liquide, Fluxys and the Port of Antwerp-Bruges. Its goal is to develop a world-scale open-access modular infrastructure for the transport, liquefaction, and export of CO 2 captured by industries in the Antwerp port area.

The project is expected to finish in June 2027, contributing as one of the captures initiatives to the PCI (Project of Common Interest) N-LiTES , which focuses on developing the infrastructure to transport and permanently store CO 2 in the Norwegian continental shelf.

In addition, Antwerp@C CO2 Export Hub has the potential to reduce the CO 2 emissions in the port of Antwerp by more than 50% by 2030 while ensuring the long-term competitiveness of one of Europe’s main economic centres.

Paloma Aba Garrote, acting Director of CINEA said: “CEF Energy has awarded 144.6 million euros to the Antwerp@C CO2 Hub project. This is the largest grant awarded so far to a CO 2 network project under this programme. That shows that the role of CO 2 networks, together with other energy infrastructure such as electricity interconnectors, storage, hydrogen, will remain key to deliver on the decarbonisation objectives of the EU.”

Besides this project, other PCIs in Flanders have been supported under CEF Energy since 2014, receiving around EUR 15 million of EU funding."
CoolCo LNG carrier retrofits could be the first of many - Seatrade Maritime News,"Mon, 12 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYXRyYWRlLW1hcml0aW1lLmNvbS90YW5rZXJzL2Nvb2xjby1sbmctY2Fycmllci1yZXRyb2ZpdHMtY291bGQtYmUtZmlyc3QtbWFuedIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"HD Hyundai Global Service, a Hyundai group service subsidiary, has been chosen to oversee design, supply, and installation of the Air Liquide reliquefaction units at a cost of $10 million per vessel.

The deepsea LNG fleet, comprising ships of more than 40,000 cubic metres, now consists of about 650 vessels, a large number of which do not have boil-off management systems. These installations cut emissions by enabling boil-off gas to be reliquefied and used as fuel or returned to cargo tanks.

Related: CII could pose serious risk to LNG ship supply

For ships without such systems, boil-off gas must be burnt off or simply emitted to air. Not only does the volume of cargo reduce over the course of a voyage, but the lightest and often most valuable components of LNG may boil off first. The value of loaded cargoes can therefore fall over the course of a voyage before the LNG is actually sold at its destination, based on energy content.

On top of this LNG carriers in the existing fleet will already fall into category D or E of the International Maritime Organization’s CII ratings, according to experts. Steam turbine vessels, of which there are about 240 in the fleet today (45 of which are more than 25 years old) already trade at a substantial discount compared with LNG carriers equipped with more modern propulsion systems because they consume 20-50% more fuel. These ships are likely to be amongst those that receive the lowest CII assessments.

Related: Eastern Pacific Shipping invests in Golar LNG spin-off CoolCo

The HD Hyundai Global Service liquefaction units that CoolCo has chosen will be effective mainly for LNG carriers with tri-fuel diesel-electric (TFDE) propulsion or two-stroke dual-fuel (DF) engines. In a statement, the company revealed that it is receiving enquiries for its systems from various potential customers.

At the IMO’s 78th MEPC meeting last year, it was agreed that a CII correction factor could be applied to LNG carriers for the fuel consumption equivalent to the power required to operate cargo liquefaction systems. This is likely to prove an additional incentive for owners to install such systems, particularly since methane emissions will be included in CII assessments from the beginning of 2026.

Although the LNG orderbook now consists of more than 330 ships, representing over half of the existing fleet, analysts point out that the relatively small number of shipyards capable of building these sophisticated ships are, in practical terms, full until 2027. Newbuilding prices have climbed dramatically, with the cost of a new 172,000 cubic metre ship, the most popular size, now more than $260 million, up from about $190 million in 2020.

Another key feature of this sector is rising demand for floating storage and regasification units (FSRU), generally a far quicker and significantly cheaper means of boosting LNG import capacity. Two of five new FSRU installations in Germany, for example, are already in operation; others are under development. But demand for FSRU terminals is evident in many regions, and ageing LNG carriers offer a fast-track option.

So, all of the ships currently in operation are needed as global demand for LNG continues to soar. In practical terms, therefore, shipyards and repair facilities capable of undertaking projects such as the CoolCo retrofit initiative should be gearing up for a wave of upgrade business to support the operating efficiency of LNG carriers in the years ahead.

In a separate development, HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering signed an agreement with Lloyd’s Register, Norway’s Knudsen OAS Shipping and Hyundai Heavy Industries, to carry out a carbon emissions assessment over the entire life of a 174,000 cubic metre LNG carrier, specifically a new vessel to be delivered to Knudsen this month.

In what is claimed to be a world first, the company will measure carbon dioxide emissions from raw material procurement, to vessel construction, operation and eventual recycling – in other words, the ship’s carbon profile ‘from cradle to grave’."

Air Liquide has signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Statkraft that will enable it to use wind power to supply its electrolyser plant in Oberhausen in Germany.

The PPA covers 45MW of wind output that will supply the 20MW green hydrogen plant, dubbed “Trailblazer”, which is expected to be operational by the end of 2023.

The electrolyser will be integrated into the existing infrastructure of Air Liquide in the Rhine-Ruhr-valley to supply key industries and the transport sector with renewable hydrogen and oxygen.

Air Liquide will be supplied with renewable energy from Statkraft’s portfolio of onshore wind farms in Germany starting in 2024 for three years.

This PPA will allow Air Liquide to certify the hydrogen as renewable and to achieve full REDII-compliance, so the customers will be able to market products with a lower-carbon footprint.

Gilles Le Van, Vice President Large Industries and Energy Transition for Air Liquide in Central Europe, said: “With this new contract, Air Liquide takes another step towards the energy transition, supplying its operations with renewable electricity.

“Securing access to renewable energy is a key element of Air Liquide’s decarbonization and Sustainable Development strategy.

“It allows us to meet the growing demand from our customers for competitive low-carbon solutions.”

The Energy Observer is a vessel powered by renewable energy and has now made its 80th stop in Cape Town as it travels across the world.

The vessel was repurposed from a racing catamaran that was built in 1983. The idea of the Energy Observer project was founded in 2013 by Victorien Erussard, a merchant navy officer and ocean racer. He is now captain of the vessel, which eventually set sail with a team of scientists, sailors and engineers from Saint-Malo, France, in 2017.

The vessel is powered by the sun, wind and hydropower and relies on lithium-ion batteries and hydrogen (produced using seawater and renewable energy) for storage.

Given these technologies, this is the first-of-its-kind zero-emissions vessel – having released no greenhouse gasses or fine particles that pollute the air, explained Beéatrice Cordiano, onboard scientist of the Energy Observer. Cordiano was participating in a panel discussion on green hydrogen (hydrogen produced using renewable energy) on Monday. The event was hosted by Air Liquide, a French industrial gases company. Air Liquide is also one of the Energy Observer's sponsors and is also working with Sasol to develop green hydrogen solutions in South Africa.

The Energy Observer has demonstrated the feasibility of the different technologies, having sailed ""many miles, for many years,"" explained Cordiano.

Apart from testing the technologies, the aim would be that this solution would be scaled as different countries, including South Africa, embark on energy transitions to reduce emissions that cause climate change. ""This energy mix can be replicated on shore at a larger scale. This represents a sustainable, reliable, and viable solution for the future,"" said Cordiano. ""This is what we need to accelerate the energy transition,"" she added.

Education and a lack of awareness have led to there being apprehension around green hydrogen, explained Crispian Olver, executive director of the Presidential Climate Commission (PCC). Olver also took part in the panel discussion.

The PCC has held multiple consultations with different stakeholders in South Africa in developing a just transition framework for the country.

Olver said that through these consultations, some NGOs and the faith community had raised concerns over the safety and environmental impacts of hydrogen. Part of this concern was because of a lack of information and awareness, Olver said.

""People were saying, 'We don't know about the sector. We see it punted by a couple of large corporates. Previously those corporates have transgressed environmental regulations. Are we going to get the same thing?'"" Olver explained.

From these interactions, he realised a lot more work needs to be done to communicate the opportunities of green hydrogen, its environmental impacts and its role in the country's decarbonisation journey.

Newsletter Weekly Climate Future Weekly An overview of the challenges and opportunities of the climate crisis, as it changes the world we know.

According to Olver, modelling by the PCC and the National Business Initiative indicate that up to 450 000 jobs could be created by 2050 from the hydrogen economy – which includes the entire value chain involved in producing it.

""Those are very significant numbers. They are game changers in terms of our low employment levels in this economy,"" said Olver. But labour has been averse to it, which Olver said is also because there needs to be more education on economic opportunities. ""If our modelling is correct, this is something labour should at least be for,"" he said.

Olver said the commission sees ""enormous promise"" in the sector.

""We have got a particularly challenging decarbonisation journey that we are going through, and I think hydrogen plays a crucial role in that journey…,"" said Olver."

The recent inauguration of the first high-pressure hydrogen station for long-haul trucks is the first refueling station of its kind in Europe. It marks a step forward in Air Liquide and Iveco Group’s joint commitment to develop hydrogen mobility in the continent.

This commitment is in line with the MoU the companies signed in December 2021.

The goal of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is to advance hydrogen as a vital enabler for the energy transition of the transport sector by leveraging the expertise of both companies.

This includes Air Liquide’s unique expertise across the entire H2 value chain – production, storage, and distribution – and IVECO’s (commercial vehicle brand of Iveco Group) manufacturing of alternative fuel vehicles.

“Our strategy for increasingly sustainable mobility is based on a technology-neutral approach and hydrogen mobility is a key building block on this path,” said Iveco Group CEO Gerrit Marx in a news release about the inauguration of the hydrogen station. “In fact, it provides an essential solution for high energy demanding commercial vehicle applications, such as long-haul transport,” Marx added.

At the hydrogen station inauguration, guests saw an IVECO H2 truck prototype.

Air Liquide’s high-pressure hydrogen refueling station opened in Fos-sur-Mer (Marseille), France on June 26, 2023. Guests who attended the inauguration had the opportunity to visit the large-capacity high-pressure station that is supplied with 1 ton of low-carbon hydrogen a day via pipeline. They were also given a first-hand look at an IVECO heavy-duty fuel cell truck prototype.

This heavy-duty H2 truck is designed for long haulage and has a speedy refueling time at 700-bar pressure. Iveco Group intends to deliver these hydrogen trucks beginning late in 2023.

The station is part of the HyAMMED project.

The Fos-sur-Mer hydrogen station is part of the French funded “Hydrogène à Aix-Marseille pour une Mobilité Ecologique et Durable” (HyAMMED) project. It is also a part of H2Haul, a European project co-financed by the Clean Hydrogen Partnership.

A second high-capacity H2 refueling station (700 bar, 2 tons per day) dedicated to heavy vehicles is slated to be installed in Salon-de-Provence and is expected to supply a potential feel of 50 IVECO H2 trucks from 2025.

“To encourage the widespread use of hydrogen, we must collectively create the conditions for the sector to flourish,” said Erwin Penfornis, Vice-President Hydrogen Energy World Business Line, Air Liquide. “It is imperative to develop a network of high-capacity stations dense enough to enable vehicle manufacturers and transport operators to embark on this transition.”
