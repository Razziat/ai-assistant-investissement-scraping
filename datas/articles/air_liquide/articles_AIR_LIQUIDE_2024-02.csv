In this context, Air Liquide will supply industrial gases under a long-term agreement and invest close to 40 million euros in the modernisation of its assets, enabling operational efficiency and reducing CO₂ emissions.

As part of the agreement, Air Liquide will modernize its existing production assets - two Air Separation Units (ASU) as well as one Partial Oxidation plant (POX), to which it will add a new CO₂ recycling solution. This will enable a circular use of the CO₂ produced, leading to around 15% increase in energy efficiency and reducing the emissions by around 15,000 tonnes/year, which represents 80% of direct CO₂ emissions of the Air Liquide site. The modernization of these assets will be completed in 2024. Air Liquide has been supplying industrial gases to Dow in Stade, Germany, for more than 20 years.

This agreement marks the fourth set of PPAs between Air Liquide and Sasol, following those established in 2023, with a cumulative renewable power capacity now totaling around 690 MW.

These contracts will facilitate an annual reduction of approximately 1.2 million tons in CO2 emissions for Air Liquide and contribute significantly to its goal of reducing CO2 emissions associated with oxygen production in Secunda by 30-40% by 2031.

Enel Green Power will establish a local company committed to socio-economic development tasked with constructing a wind farm in South Africa's Eastern Cape province. The wind farm is slated to become operational by 2026.

Nicolas Poirot, CEO of Africa Middle-East & India, emphasized that the newly-forged renewable electricity supply agreements reaffirm the steadfast joint dedication to decarbonizing oxygen production in Secunda following Air Liquide's acquisition of Sasol's units in 2021. These enduring contracts will play a pivotal role in advancing renewable energy development in South Africa, thereby enhancing the nation's electrical infrastructure and fostering societal progress within the framework of a Just Transition.

Air Liquide acquired Sasol's 16 oxygen production units in Secunda in June 2021 and has since operated them under a long-term supply contract. With an additional Air Separation Unit (ASU) already under its operation for Sasol, Air Liquide now oversees a total of 17 ASUs in Secunda, boasting a collective capacity of 47,000 tons/day of oxygen. Air Liquide aims to reduce CO2 emissions (Scope 2) from the 16 oxygen production units it acquired from Sasol by 30% to 40% through a comprehensive investment and modernization plan, coupled with a substantial increase in renewable energy procurement.

In this context, the units in New York will be upgraded via energy efficiency projects in order to support the site’s efficiency and sustainability needs over this period.

Together, these projects will enable GlobalFoundries to further reduce its overall carbon footprint. This collaboration is part of Air Liquide’s long-lasting partnership with GlobalFoundries, to support their growth in major semiconductor hubs, as illustrated by their cooperation in Dresden, Germany.

The semiconductor industry is rapidly evolving, with increasing demand for more energy-efficient semiconductor chips and Air Liquide is scaling up investments in major semiconductor hubs to support its customer’s presence in key markets such as smart mobile devices, automotive, IoT and data centers.

Armelle Levieux, member of Air Liquide’s Executive Committee overseeing Electronics activities, stated

Our journey with GlobalFoundries started more than 20 years ago and these contract extensions are further reinforcing our strategic partnership. To meet the specific needs of our electronics customers, we develop innovative solutions that bring both efficiencies and sustainability benefits. Combined with our strategic presence, close to our customers in major semiconductor hubs, our comprehensive portfolio of products and services enables us to address the technological challenges of the semiconductor industry while leveraging opportunities arising from the market’s structural growth.

Roberto Avallone, Head of Global Facilities and Capacity Planning at GlobalFoundries, stated

Environmental sustainability is imperative to our business as we continue to meet the demand for GF-manufactured essential chips. Our strong collaboration with Air Liquide is a part of our global manufacturing expansion strategy in Singapore, U.S. and Germany, and we look forward to adopting more innovative solutions that further decarbonize our operations in line with our global Journey to Zero Carbon strategy.

Announced in August 2021, GF’s Journey to Zero Carbon Goal aims first to reduce the company’s total greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2030, despite a significant planned growth of its global manufacturing capacity."

Air Liquide Signs its first Virtual Power Purchase Agreement - Yahoo Finance,"Tue, 13 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9haXItbGlxdWlkZS1zaWducy1maXJzdC12aXJ0dWFsLTA5MjgwMDUxOC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, February 13, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:

Air Liquide (Paris:AI) has signed a long-term Virtual Power Purchase Agreement (""VPPA"") with Statkraft, the largest producer of renewable energy in Europe. This is a first-of-its-kind for Air Liquide, which innovates financially to contribute to the Group’s decarbonization and sustainability strategy.

Sourcing renewable energies through Power Purchase Agreements is one of the levers to support Air Liquide's ADVANCE strategic plan objectives of reaching a -33% reduction of scope 1 & 2 of its absolute CO 2 emissions by 2035, and carbon neutrality by 2050.

The contract provides for the supply of renewable energy certificates from Polish wind farms, linked to newly installed renewable production capacity. It will contribute to reducing CO 2 emissions of Air Liquide by 38,000 tonnes/year, and help customers in Poland decarbonize their operations, by using industrial gases with a lower carbon footprint. This agreement also supports the country’s target to reach at least 23% share of renewable energies in final energy consumption in 2030.

A Virtual PPA, also known as Financial PPA, is an innovative transaction exchanging a fixed-price for a variable price and renewable energy certificates. The completion of such contracts is beneficial to both renewable electricity producers and industrial consumers in the long term. It enables the seller to secure a given level of income and it grants the buyer visibility and stability on part of its energy sourcing costs.

Jérôme Pelletan, Chief Financial Officer, Member of the Executive Committee, said: ""Along with the signature of multiple Corporate PPAs in Europe, in the US, in Asia and in Africa, the conclusion of this Financial PPA is a first-of-its-kind for Air Liquide. It demonstrates the strong commitment and innovation from all teams, business and finance, to contribute to meeting our climate objectives. This will clear the path for the signature of more contracts of this type in the future"".

Air Liquide registered a record number of signatures for new small on-site gas production units in 2023 - Air Liquide,"Wed, 14 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5haXJsaXF1aWRlLmNvbS9ncm91cC9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy1uZXdzLzIwMjQtMDItMTQvYWlyLWxpcXVpZGUtcmVnaXN0ZXJlZC1yZWNvcmQtbnVtYmVyLXNpZ25hdHVyZXMtbmV3LXNtYWxsLXNpdGUtZ2FzLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tdW5pdHMtMjAyM9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In 2023, Air Liquide set a new record by signing 62 new small gas production units directly installed on its customers' sites in the industrial merchant and electronics sectors in 2023. This growth reflects the increased demand for these solutions, and illustrates our capacity to meet customers' needs. They offer real advantages: a continuous, reliable supply of gas, adapted to each client's production needs and helping to reduce carbon emissions.

In the industrial merchant sector, these small on-site gas production units are highly appreciated by customers, particularly in the metallurgy, chemical and automotive industries, for their competitiveness and reliability in supplying the small molecules essential to their activities, such as nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen.

The increase in the number of new small on-site gas production units signed is also driven by structural growth in the electronics market, with strong trends around AI, digitalization and the Internet of Things. Among its solutions for this industry, Air Liquide supplies its customers with ultra-pure gases such as ultra-pure nitrogen. They are indispensable to electronics manufacturers: they create the inert atmosphere needed to produce semiconductors, photovoltaic cells and printed circuit boards, which consist of very thin layers and are extremely sensitive to the ambient environment.

Based on proprietary technologies developed by the Group, the small on-site gas production units are installed, operated and maintained directly on customer sites. They eliminate the need to liquefy gases for their transportation, and reduce the number of trucks and mileage needed to deliver to customers. This generates energy savings and reduces CO2 emissions. These small on-site gas production units are based on contracts typically signed for 10 to 15 years, contributing to the stability of industrial merchant and electronics sales over the long term.

The number of new small on-site gas production units signed by Air Liquide for on-site gas production in the industrial merchant and electronics sectors is increasing steadily, contributing to the objectives of the Group's ADVANCE plan."
Air Liquide Eyes More Investments as Backlog Grows to $4.8B - Yahoo Finance,"Thu, 22 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9haXItbGlxdWlkZS1leWVzLW1vcmUtaW52ZXN0bWVudHMtMTQwMjAwMTI1Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris-based Air Liquide, the industrial gases company that is a partner in six of the seven U.S. hydrogen hubs, saw its investment backlog surge to a record €4.4 billion (US$4.76 billion) last year as it eyes more investment decisions.

Speaking during the company’s full-year 2023 earnings call this week, Air Liquide CEO François Jackow said the backlog is balanced between large industrial projects and electronics, mainly in Asia; however, the U.S. energy transition weighting has increased.

“Beyond our high investment decision signings and robust backlog, we are actively pursuing well-developed projects and partnerships, providing a deep pool of growth opportunities for the midterm,” Jackow said Feb. 20.

Global goals to decrease greenhouse gas emissions have increased interest in lower carbon energy sources such as hydrogen, biomethane solutions, waste-to-gas technologies, carbon use as well as CNG, LNG and hydrogen technology and infrastructure—all of which are part of Air Liquide’s targeted industrial and transportation markets.

The company reported a net profit of €3.08 billion ($US3.33 billion) for 2023, up more than 11% compared to 2022. Group revenue reached €27.61 billion, down 7.8% due to lower energy prices and negative currency impacts. The company’s gas and services business, which represents 95% of the group’s revenue, increased 4.2% with all regions—including the U.S.—seeing growth.

Air Liquide, which proposed a dividend of €3.20 (US$3.46) per share, also improved its operating margin by more than 80 basis points while expressing confidence in its ability to further increase the margin in 2024. It is aiming for a +320 basis points increase, which Jackow said is twice the company’s initial ambition.

Asked by an analyst about potential risks as the company ramps up investment, particularly in hydrogen, Pascal Vinet, Air Liquide executive vice president, pointed to the company’s diverse and balanced energy transition portfolio.

“We have hydrogen, hydrogen in a classical way, hydrogen with electrolyzers. But we also have carbon capture projects. We have oxygen—large oxygen projects. We have a CO 2 terminal,” Vinet said. “So, we do not expect a dilution coming from H 2 . We will have … typical oil contracts. We’ll maintain our return on capital employed, and we should, again, maintain our margin, thanks to that balanced portfolio. [We] don’t see energy transition just as hydrogen only. It’s a lot more than that, and it’s a very balanced portfolio we have.”

Air Liquide looks to make industrial and financial investment decisions on €16 billion (US$17.3 billion) worth of projects through 2025.

“And while we prepare for the future, we remain very disciplined in our investment decisions to maximize value creation,” Jackow said.

The company is also positioned to play a major role in efforts to scale up hydrogen in the U.S., serving as a partner in six hydrogen hubs. These include HyVelocity on the Gulf Coast, Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub (PNWH2), Appalachia Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub (ARCH2), Midwest Alliance for Clean Hydrogen hub (MACHH2), the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems in California and the Mid-Atlantic Clean Hydrogen Hub.

While the company has identified a 12-month portfolio of projects, Jackow said Air Liquide probably has about three times that amount—spread across various regions.

“This being said, we know that those projects—which are becoming more complex, larger, which requires sometimes regulations, sometimes subsidies, sometimes an ecosystem—take some time to develop,” he said, adding there is still strong momentum on feasibility and engineering studies across regions.

“But we want to be, I would say, prudent regarding the assumptions for the signing [of projects] in the next two years because there could be some delays. … This year is also a year with elections in major parts of the world.”

That, he added, could lead to a “wait-and-see type of behavior from customers.”"

“In 2023, Air Liquide achieved a solid performance, highlighting the resilience and quality of our business model as well as the mobilization and agility of our teams in a complex and changing macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. The Group’s performance was characterized by an increase in sales on a comparable basis, a further improvement in its operating margin excluding the energy impact and an accelerating investment momentum, particularly in decarbonization projects.

In particular, I am proud to highlight that we have practically reached, in two years, the margin ambition targeted for 2025 as part of our ADVANCE strategic plan. As a consequence, we announce today that we are doubling our initial ambition.

We also confirm our other ADVANCE financial objectives, sales growth on a comparable basis and Return on Capital Employed, as well as our investment decision ambition. In addition, on the extra-financial level, our many decarbonization initiatives give us confidence in our objective to combine growth in our business with a reduction in our CO2 emissions in absolute value from 2025.

Revenue reached 27.61 billion euros, an increase of +3.7% on a comparable basis in 2023. On a published basis, it stood at -7.8%, due to the drop in energy prices - for which variations are contractually passed through to Large Industries customers - as well as negative currency impacts. The Gas & Services business, which represented 95% of the Group’s revenue, was up +4.2% on a comparable basis. Within this activity, all regions saw growth, in particular the Americas and Europe, driven notably by Industrial Merchant and Healthcare.

In line with its ADVANCE strategic plan, Air Liquide continued to improve its operational performance. The Group generated record efficiencies of 466 million euros, up +23% despite an inflationary context unfavorable to savings on procurement, and continued the dynamic management of its business portfolio. Its ability to provide its customers with value-added offerings allows it to adjust its prices in Industrial Merchant. As a result, the operating margin increased further, by +80 basis points in 2023 excluding the energy impact, and therefore by +150 basis points over 2022-2023. Having practically reached our margin target halfway through ADVANCE which was at +160 basis points, we now aim for a +320 basis points increase, twice our initial ambition, over the duration of the plan.

Net profit (Group share) amounted to 3.08 billion euros, up +11.6% as published. Net proﬁt recurring() increased by +13.3% excluding the currency impact. Cash flow() grew by +12.8% excluding the currency impact. The balance sheet is strong with a net debt to equity ratio of 36.8%. At 10.6% at end-December, recurring ROCE() remained well above 10%, in line with the objectives of ADVANCE, despite the increase in our investments. Reflecting our confidence in the future, the dividend that will be submitted to the shareholders’ vote in April amounts to 3.20 euros per share, i.e. an increase of +8.5%. In addition, a free share attribution is scheduled for June 2024, on the basis of one share for every 10 shares held.

The investment dynamic of the Group is accelerating, supported in particular by our projects in the energy transition and electronics. The backlog is historically high at 4.4 billion euros. Investment decisions reached a record level of 4.3 billion euros in 2023.

In 2024, Air Liquide is confident in its ability to further increase its operating margin and to deliver growth in Net proﬁt recurring, at constant exchange rates().""

Financial performance

Group revenue for 2023 totaled 27,608 million euros, posting comparable growth of +3.7% over 2022. The Group’s revenue as published was down -7.8%, impacted by unfavorable energy (-7.6%) and currency (-4.2%) impacts, the signiﬁcant perimeter impact being slightly positive at +0.3%.

Gas & Services revenue totaled 26,360 million euros in 2023, an increase on a comparable basis of +4.2%. Revenue as published in the Gas & Services business was down -7.7%, penalized by negative energy (-8.0%) and currency (-4.2%) impacts, while the significant scope effect was slightly positive at +0.3%.

The two growth() drivers for 2023 were the Industrial Merchant business, with sales up +8.5%, benefiting from a price impact that remained high (+8.4%) and resilient volumes, and the Healthcare business (+8.4%), bolstered by the dynamic development of Home Healthcare and the increase in the prices of medical gases in an inflationary environment. Revenue from Large Industries was down -1.8% over the year, demand stabilized at a relatively low level. Sales in Electronics increased by +2.4% in 2023, following growth of +16% in 2022, the sharp drop in demand from memory manufacturers having impacted sales from the 2nd quarter.

Gas & Services revenue in the Americas totaled 10,169 million euros in 2023, up by +5.1% . Large Industries sales (-2.2%) were impacted by customer turnarounds and relatively low demand. The Industrial Merchant business posted strong growth of +6.7%, boosted by a high price impact (+6.3%) and slightly positive volumes. In Healthcare, the rise in prices in proximity care in the United States and the dynamism of the business in South America contributed to the strong increase in sales (+14.2%). Electronics revenue was down by -2.8% in a context of slowing demand from memory manufacturers impacting sales of materials.

Gas & Services revenue in Europe was up +4.2% in 2023 and totaled 9,734 million euros . Large Industries sales were slightly down (-0.9%) in a context of weak demand from customers in the Chemicals and Steel industries. Revenue from the Industrial Merchant business rose sharply, by +12.3%, driven by a price impact of +14.0% and resilient volumes excluding helium and liquefied CO2. Healthcare sales increased by +5.8%, benefiting from the dynamism of Home Healthcare and the increase in medical gas prices in an inflationary context.

Gas & Services revenue for the Asia Pacific region in 2023 rose by +1.8% , to total 5,410 million euros . The Large Industries business (-5.5%) was impacted by weak demand and customer turnarounds. Sales in the Industrial Merchant business were up sharply, by +9.9%, driven by a high price impact at +7.3% and by an increase in volumes, in China in particular. Growth in Electronics was +2.2% over the year: very dynamic in 1 st quarter, it was then impacted by lower demand from memory manufacturers and a very high basis of comparison in 2022.

Gas & Services revenue in the Middle East & Africa region increased by +7.0% to 1,047 million euros in 2023. All business lines grew.

Global Markets & Technologies revenue for 2023 was down by -1.0% compared to 2022, at 858 million euros. Organic growth reached +9.7%, excluding the divestitures carried out at the end of 2022. Order intake for Group projects and third-party customers amounted to 926 million euros, up +5.8% compared to 2022.

Consolidated revenue from Engineering & Construction totaled 390 million euros in 2023, down by -15.6%. Consolidated revenue excludes activities carried out as part of internal projects for Large Industries and Electronics, which are growing. Order intake amounted to 1,511 million euros for Group projects and third-party customers and hence exceeded 1 billion euros for the third consecutive year.

The Group's operating income recurring (OIR) reached 5,068 million euros in 2023, an increase of +4.2% as published. It increased by +11.4% on a comparable basis, which is significantly higher than the comparable sales growth of +3.7%, highlighting a strong leverage effect. This performance reflects the progress of the action plan deployed around 3 levers: efficiencies, pricing management in particular in Industrial Merchant and a dynamic asset portfolio management. Hence, the efficiencies() amounted to 466 million euros in 2023, a sharp increase of +23.2% compared with 2022 and significantly above the annual target of 400 million euros.

Excluding the energy impact, the operating margin improved very significantly by +80 basis points. Thus, the sum of improvements in the operating margin excluding energy impact in 2022 and 2023 reached +150 basis points and compares to the +160 basis points expected over the 4-year period of the ADVANCE plan. Consequently, the ambition for improvement in the margin excluding the energy impact of the ADVANCE strategic plan is raised to +320 basis points over 4 years, which reflects an acceleration. This corresponds to twice the improvement initially planned. Hence, +170 basis points of improvement are expected for the remaining 2 years of the ADVANCE plan.

Net proﬁt (Group share) reached 3,078 million euros in 2023, showing strong growth of +11.6% as published and an increase of +21.0% excluding the currency impact. It exceeded 3 billion euros for the first time. Net profit recurring (Group share)() amounted to 3,320 million euros, up by +5.0%, and +13.3% excluding currency impact.

Net earnings per share, stood at 5.90 euros and were up +11.7% as published compared with 2022, in line with the increase in net profit (Group share).

Net cash flow from operating activities after changes in working capital requirement amounted to 6,263 million euros, a strong increase of +7.8% compared with 2022 and +12.8% excluding the currency impact.

Net debt at December 31, 2023, amounted to 9,221 million euros, a decrease of 1,040 million euros compared with December 31, 2022. Indeed, cash ﬂows from operating activities allowed to reduce the net debt after the payment of over 3.4 billion euros in industrial investments and 1.6 billion euros in dividends.

The return on capital employed after tax (ROCE) was 9.8% in 2023. The recurring ROCE(7) stood at 10.6 %, an improvement compared to 10.3% in 2022 and aligned with the ADVANCE strategic plan's double-digit objective.

Industrial and financial investment decisions reached a high level of 4.3 billion euros in 2023, up sharply from 4.0 billion euros in 2022. The investment backlog hit a record high of 4.4 billion euros in 2023, a sharp increase from 3.5 billion euros in 2022.

At the General Meeting on April 30, 2024, the payment of a dividend of 3.20 euros per share will be proposed to shareholders for the 2023 fiscal year, representing an increase of +8.5% compared with the previous year. The ex-dividend date has been set for May 20, 2024, and the payment is scheduled for May 22, 2024. Moreover, a free share attribution, on the basis of one free share for every 10 shares held, as well as the application of a loyalty bonus, are planned for June 2024.

Extra-financial performance

The Group's scopes 1 and 2 CO2 emissions in 2023 totaled 37.6 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent(). They were down -4.7% compared with 2022 and -4.9% compared with the 2020 baseline.

The Group announced in 2023 the signature of long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs), for more than 1.5 TWh per year aiming to reduce its annual emissions of CO2 by around -1.2 million tonnes. Moreover the Group pursues carbon capture and energy efficiency project development.

With these achievements, Air Liquide is confident to accomplish its ADVANCE near term goal of CO2 emissions inflection in 2025.

On the social aspect, safety is a priority. The lost-time accident frequency rate() stood at 1.0 in 2023. The share of employees benefitting from a common basis of care coverage reached 78%, showing a sharp increase compared to 34% in 2021, in line with the objective of 100% by 2025.

Finally, the Access Oxygen program pursues its development. Over 2 million people have been facilitated with access to medical oxygen in low and moderate income countries, a +16% increase compared to 2022.

Governance

On the recommendation of the Appointments and Governance Committee, the Board of Directors also approved the draft resolutions which will be submitted to the General Meeting of April 30, 2024 in order to renew for a period of four years, the term of office of two Directors:

Ms Kim Ann Mink , an American national, who has been a Director on the Board of Directors since May 2020 and a member of the Remuneration Committee since September 2021. Having spent most of her career in major international groups in the chemicals industry, where she held various management positions, Ms Kim Ann Mink brings her experience in the fields of research and innovation and her managerial skills to the Board of Directors, in addition to her scientific expertise.

Ms Monica de Virgiliis , a French-Italian national, who has been a Director on the Board of Directors since February 15, 2023, following her provisional appointment by the Board of Directors (ratified by the General Meeting of May 3, 2023), replacing Ms Anette Bronder for the remainder of her term of office, i.e. until the end of the General Meeting of April 30, 2024. She has also been a member of the Environment and Society Committee since May 2023. Ms Monica de Virgiliis brings to the Board of Directors her experience of more than 15 years in the Electronics business, her skills in the field of technology and energy, her managerial skills and her commitment to energy transition.

The Board of Directors has qualified Ms. Kim Ann Mink and Ms. Monica de Virgiliis as independent Directors.

During its plenary meeting of November 9, 2023, the European Works Council renewed the term of office as Director representing the employees of Ms Fatima Tighlaline, (which expires at the end of the General Meeting of April, 30, 2024) for a period of four years expiring at the end of the 2028 General Meeting, which will approve the financial statements for the 2027 fiscal year.

At the end of the General Meeting, subject to approval by the Meeting of all the resolutions proposed, the Board of Directors composition would therefore remain unchanged at 14 members: 12 members appointed by the General Meeting, most of whom are independent (i.e. 83% independent Directors), including 5 women (i.e. 42%), 5 foreign nationals (i.e. 42%) and 2 Directors representing the employees.

Finally, the Board of Directors will submit to the vote of the General Meeting the elements of remuneration of Mr François Jackow, Chief Executive Officer, and of Mr Benoît Potier, Chairman of the Board of Directors, together with the information relating to the remuneration of all the corporate officers for 2023. The General Meeting will also be invited to decide upon the remuneration policy for the corporate officers which will apply to Mr. François Jackow, Chief Executive Officer, to Mr Benoît Potier, Chairman of the Board of Directors and to the Directors.

Air Liquide’s Board of Directors, which met on February 19, 2024, approved the audited financial statements for the 2023 fiscal year. The Statutory Auditors are in the process of issuing a report with an unqualified opinion.

Air Liquide (AIQUY) Invests to Cut CO2 Emissions in Germany - Yahoo Finance,"Tue, 13 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9haXItbGlxdWlkZS1haXF1eS1pbnZlc3RzLWN1dC0xMjE1MDA4OTcuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"L'Air Liquide S.A AIQUY and Dow recently renewed their industrial gas supply arrangement at Stade, Germany, one of Lower Saxony's largest chemical production facilities.



Per the deal, Air Liquide will supply industrial gases under a long-term deal while investing nearly 40 million euros in asset modernization to improve operating efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions. Air Liquide has been supplying industrial gases to Dow in Stade for more than 20 years.



As part of the arrangement, Air Liquide will upgrade its existing production assets - two Air Separation Units and one Partial Oxidation facility - as well as add a new CO2 recycling solution. This will allow the circular use of the CO2 produced, resulting in a 15% gain in energy efficiency and a reduction in emissions of around 15,000 tons per year, accounting for 80% of the Air Liquide site's direct CO2 emissions. The renovation of these assets will be finished by 2024.



The required industrial transformation will need not only ground-breaking greenfield projects but also step-by-step modifications and modernization of existing plants. This is why, as part of Air Liquide's long-term extension of the supply deal with Dow, the company has opted to invest in modernizing its Stade assets.



The solution applied will recycle CO2 from an existing production plant, allowing the company to improve energy efficiency while also lowering CO2 emissions. This investment aligns with Air Liquide's ADVANCE strategic plan, which includes the goal of lowering the Group's carbon emissions by one-third by 2035.



Shares of Air Liquide have gained 15.9% over the past year against a 20.7% decline of its industry.

TEAL Mobility aims to develop more than 100 hydrogen stations over the next decade, creating the first transnational European network of this size, under the TotalEnergies brand. It will operate around 20 stations in France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxemburg and Germany from 2024.

Several heavy truck manufacturers have been increasing production of hydrogen fuel trucks to meet sustainability requirements. Hydrogen is considered a more effective fuel source for heavy duty trucks than electricity in some circumstances, such as long-hauls in rural areas where battery charging may be limited. Hydrogen also enables rapid refueling and longer range, while preserving vehicle loading capacity.

The partners announced the initiative to create TEAL Mobility last year, saying that it would combine TotalEnergies’ expertise in the operation and management of station networks and distribution of energies to BtoB customers, with Air Liquide’s technologies and hydrogen value chain capabilities. In 2022 Air Liquide unveiled plans to invest €8 billion (USD$8.65 billion) in the hydrogen supply chain by 2035.

The company named Florentin de Loppinot as CEO. de Loppinot has been at TotalEnergies for nearly 25 years, serving most recently as Head of Strategy and New Business, EV Charge.

Mexico orders expropriation of Air Liquide's hydrogen plant - Offshore Technology,"Mon, 12 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9mZnNob3JlLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kuY29tL25ld3MvdGhlLW1leGljYW4tZ292ZXJubWVudC1oYXMtb3JkZXJlZC10aGUtZXhwcm9wcmlhdGlvbi1vZi1haXItbGlxdWlkZXMtaHlkcm9nZW4tcGxhbnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The state owned Pemex will assume control of the hydrogen plant. Credit: Matthew Rutledge.

Mexico’s government has ordered the expropriation of Air Liquide’s hydrogen plant at a Pemex oil refinery, citing the need to ensure Mexico’s “energy sovereignty”.

The French company bought the hydrogen plant under the previous administration.

The announcement was made by Mexico’s energy ministry late on Thursday 8 February, 2024, claiming that the third-party supply of hydrogen risks disrupting production at the Tula refinery, owned and operated by the state-run Pemex.

Oil refineries use hydrogen to reduce the sulphur content in petroleum products such as diesel.

Air Liquide has 15 days from the publication of the expropriation order to present its response to the ministry’s legal office.

President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has attempted to increase state control of Mexico’s energy sector through Pemex and the state electricity company CFE since coming to power in 2018. He has also tried to reduce the country’s reliance on diesel and gas imports by ramping up domestic production.

His predecessor, the centrist former President Enrique Pen Nieto, sold Pemex’s refining arm under a 20-year contract to Air Liquide in 2017. The French industrial gases and services company was to supply hydrogen for Tula’s operations to lower costs and boost efficiency.

Located in central Hidalgo state, north of Mexico City, the Tula facility is Pemex’s second- largest refinery currently in operation.

In December, the Obrador administration ordered Pemex to take control of the hydrogen plant. The President declared the hydrogen supply from the plant was a matter of “public interest”.

Obrador has accused opponents on the political right of rigging the energy market in favour of corporate elites, and his policy decisions have led to trade disputes with the US and Canada.

In similar fashion, the government spooked investors in 2023 when it took over part of Grupo Mexico’s railway."

Mexico Orders Expropriation of Hydrogen Plant Sold to Air Liquide - ChemAnalyst,"Mon, 12 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoZW1hbmFseXN0LmNvbS9OZXdzQW5kRGVhbHMvTmV3c0RldGFpbHMvbWV4aWNvLW9yZGVycy1leHByb3ByaWF0aW9uLW9mLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLXBsYW50LXNvbGQtdG8tYWlyLWxpcXVpZGUtMjUxNTbSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Mexico Orders Expropriation of Hydrogen Plant Sold to Air Liquide

Mexico's government has issued a decree for the expropriation of a hydrogen plant situated within a Pemex oil refinery, which had been previously sold to French company Air Liquide during the prior administration. This action comes in the wake of officials ordering a temporary occupation of the facility in December. The announcement of expropriation from Mexico's energy ministry surfaced in the government's official gazette late on Thursday. The rationale behind this decision revolves around perceived risks to motor fuels production at the Tula refinery, which is owned and operated by state-run Pemex, owing to the reliance on third-party hydrogen supply.

Hydrogen plays a crucial role in oil refineries, particularly in reducing the sulfur content in petroleum products, with a particular emphasis on diesel. Hence, any disruption or uncertainty in hydrogen supply could potentially impact the refining processes and, subsequently, the production of motor fuels.

Moreover, the government's declaration also underscores the imperative of safeguarding Mexico's ""energy sovereignty"" through the expropriation of the privately-operated hydrogen facility. The order specifies that the concerned firm has a 15-day window from the publication date to present its response to the ministry's legal office.

Since assuming office in late 2018, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a leftist leader, has been steadfast in his efforts to consolidate greater control over the country's energy sector, favoring entities such as Pemex and the state electricity company CFE. This move is aligned with his broader vision of bolstering domestic production of gasoline and diesel, thereby reducing Mexico's historical dependence on foreign imports.

In 2017, Pemex's refining arm entered into a 20-year contractual agreement with Air Liquide, aiming to procure hydrogen for the Tula refinery's operations. The objective behind this collaboration was to drive down costs and enhance operational efficiency. Situated in central Hidalgo state, north of Mexico City, the Tula refinery stands as Pemex's second-largest operational refinery.

The decision to temporarily occupy the Air Liquide plant in December stemmed from concerns over the refinery's operational continuity and the need to address any potential disruptions promptly. At that time, the government asserted that Pemex should provide compensation to the French company for any inconveniences caused. However, the recent expropriation order does not explicitly mention any provisions for compensation.

The expropriation of the hydrogen plant underscores the Mexican government's assertive stance in asserting control over strategic assets within the energy sector. By bringing essential components of the refining process under state control, the government aims to ensure stability and security in energy supply, thus advancing its broader energy policy objectives.

However, this move has sparked debates and concerns regarding potential implications for foreign investment and private enterprise within Mexico's energy landscape. Critics argue that such measures could undermine investor confidence and deter future investments in the country's energy infrastructure."

We Like These Underlying Return On Capital Trends At L'Air Liquide (EPA:AI) - Simply Wall St,"Thu, 08 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3NpbXBseXdhbGwuc3Qvc3RvY2tzL2ZyL21hdGVyaWFscy9lcGEtYWkvbGFpci1saXF1aWRlLXNoYXJlcy9uZXdzL3dlLWxpa2UtdGhlc2UtdW5kZXJseWluZy1yZXR1cm4tb24tY2FwaXRhbC10cmVuZHMtYXQtbGFpci1sadIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If you're looking for a multi-bagger, there's a few things to keep an eye out for. Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. So on that note, L'Air Liquide ( ) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.

Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?

Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for L'Air Liquide:

Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)

0.12 = €4.8b ÷ (€49b - €9.8b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).

Therefore, L'Air Liquide has an ROCE of 12%. On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 6.4% generated by the Chemicals industry.

In the above chart we have measured L'Air Liquide's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free .

So How Is L'Air Liquide's ROCE Trending?

L'Air Liquide's ROCE growth is quite impressive. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 37% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. On that front, things are looking good so it's worth exploring what management has said about growth plans going forward.

The Key Takeaway

To sum it up, L'Air Liquide is collecting higher returns from the same amount of capital, and that's impressive. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if L'Air Liquide can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.

L'Air Liquide (EPA:AI) Will Pay A Larger Dividend Than Last Year At €3.20 - Simply Wall St,"Fri, 23 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3NpbXBseXdhbGwuc3Qvc3RvY2tzL2ZyL21hdGVyaWFscy9lcGEtYWkvbGFpci1saXF1aWRlLXNoYXJlcy9uZXdzL2xhaXItbGlxdWlkZS1lcGFhaS13aWxsLXBheS1hLWxhcmdlci1kaXZpZGVuZC10aGFuLWxhc3QteWVhci0x0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The board of L'Air Liquide S.A. ( ) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of €3.20 on the 22nd of May, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 1.7%, which is fairly typical for the industry.

L'Air Liquide's Dividend Is Well Covered By Earnings

We like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. The last dividend was quite easily covered by L'Air Liquide's earnings. This indicates that quite a large proportion of earnings is being invested back into the business.

Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 41.3%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 41% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.

L'Air Liquide Has A Solid Track Record

Even over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The annual payment during the last 10 years was €1.71 in 2014, and the most recent fiscal year payment was €3.20. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 6.5% over that duration. The growth of the dividend has been pretty reliable, so we think this can offer investors some nice additional income in their portfolio.

L'Air Liquide Could Grow Its Dividend

Investors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. It's encouraging to see that L'Air Liquide has been growing its earnings per share at 7.6% a year over the past five years. Earnings are on the uptrend, and it is only paying a small portion of those earnings to shareholders.

L'Air Liquide Looks Like A Great Dividend Stock

In summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.

It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. Earnings growth generally bodes well for the future value of company dividend payments. See if the 18 L'Air Liquide analysts we track are forecasting continued growth with our free .

Air Liquide selected for the Texas Hydrogen Production Policy Council - Hydrogen Central,"Wed, 14 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vaHlkcm9nZW4tY2VudHJhbC5jb20vYWlyLWxpcXVpZGUtc2VsZWN0ZWQtZm9yLXRoZS10ZXhhcy1oeWRyb2dlbi1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLXBvbGljeS1jb3VuY2lsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Air Liquide selected for the Texas Hydrogen Production Policy Council.

Hydrogen’s ability to be produced locally, utilizing the natural resources and talent available by region, is the driving force behind the efforts to connect a national hydrogen economy through regional ecosystems. Perhaps surprising to some, Texas is the world’s leading hydrogen producer and this historical knowledge of production puts it at the forefront of the clean energy transition.

Now, with the recent formation of the Texas Hydrogen Production Policy Council, Air Liquide will be offering its expertise to advance hydrogen into the future. The Council, formed by the Railroad Commission of Texas, brings together industry, community and government leaders to further the “development of a state plan for hydrogen production, analyze the development of hydrogen industries around the state, and monitor regional efforts for the application and development of a clean hydrogen hub authorized under the Federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act”.

Air Liquide produces nearly 5 billion cubic meters of hydrogen in the U.S. annually – and well over half of that is produced in the Gulf Coast. This hydrogen is then moved and stored along Air Liquide’s world-class infrastructure including our Gulf Coast pipeline system and hydrogen storage cavern. Air Liquide’s largest pipeline system in the world is backed up by the largest hydrogen storage cavern globally. Located in Texas, the cavern is the largest globally and provides storage of over 4.5 B cubic feet of hydrogen to complement Air Liquide’s robust supply capabilities along the Gulf Coast. In addition, as a member of 6 of the 7 regional hydrogen hubs selected by the U.S. Department of Energy, including Texas’ own HyVelocity Hub, Air Liquide will contribute to the Council a high-level view of the potential hydrogen ecosystem, with a detailed regional focus.

This article is part of a series on clean hydrogen. Get caught up here.

HOUSTON — The scraggly grasses and standing water at the Spindletop oil field, near Beaumont in east Texas, don’t immediately suggest the site of a world-changing energy breakthrough. But there, one morning in 1901, workers released a gusher of oil over 100 feet high, turning Texas into a global capital of fossil-fuel extraction. That coastal landscape soon drew a frenzied boomtown of oil rigs, and they sucked out the ancient fuel that had pooled around the subterranean salt dome. Eventually, the oil dried up, and the industry left for opportunities elsewhere. Now, 4,000 feet below Spindletop, the same geologic salt formation houses the molecule spurring the latest Gulf Coast energy boom: hydrogen. Unlike with oil, people put the hydrogen there. Spindletop’s salt dome is just one node in a network of hydrogen production, pipelines and underground storage that stretches across Texas and the Gulf region — a kind of sub-industry serving the better-known petrochemical sector. In response to more stringent air-quality regulations in the 1990s, refiners needed more hydrogen to desulfurize their fuels. They also needed it to ​“crack” heavy hydrocarbons. Cleaning up tailpipe exhaust created problems for the climate: Traditional hydrogen production essentially cooks methane with steam and vents the resulting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. It has become one of the largest industrial greenhouse gas emitters in a region infamous for industrial emissions. But these days, everyone from ExxonMobil to pure-play renewable developers is vying to turn Houston into a global center for low-carbon hydrogen. Methane-based hydrogen producers are looking to add carbon-capture devices and sequester emissions underground. Others plan to funnel solar and wind power directly into electrolyzers, producing hydrogen without any fossil fuels. Cleaning up hydrogen could position the Gulf at the center of efforts to decarbonize a range of dirty industries — think shipping, long-distance trucking and carbon-intensive industrial processes. The Biden administration has enacted an unprecedented tax credit to lower the premium for ​“clean” hydrogen and invested $7 billion across seven regional hubs to jump-start production, distribution and use of the clean molecule. Houston’s HyVelocity Hub won a chunk of that change last fall, and it is negotiating final terms with the Department of Energy. Thus far, though, clean-hydrogen production scarcely exists, and it remains far from achieving industrial scale. Climate advocates hotly contest what should even qualify as ​“clean” hydrogen and how exactly this resource should be used to best serve the economywide transition from fossil fuels. Nevertheless, if I had to bet on where clean hydrogen takes off first, my money’s on the Gulf Coast. “There’s been a hydrogen economy here for a very long time, whereas some of the other hubs are essentially building it from scratch,” said Alan Alexander, a Houston-based partner at law firm Vinson & Elkins specializing in hydrogen deals. Over two weeks traversing the region this winter, I saw others were putting their money on Houston, too. “There’s a lot of interest and a lot of developers chasing projects,” said Brett Perlman, CEO of the Center for Houston’s Future. The nonprofit, which helped coordinate Houston’s winning hub proposal, had tallied 35 hydrogen production projects in the region as of six months ago. ​“Maybe some of them are doing it to address climate change,” but they also want to make a return on their investment, Perlman noted. Perlman witnessed the dawn of the competitive ERCOT electricity markets as a Texas utility regulator, and he recognizes something in the air now that’s reminiscent of those days. Two decades after opening up the grid to entrepreneurial development, Texas has built more renewables than any other state. That urge for profit could do for hydrogen what it did for renewables, but hydrogen’s climate calculus is not so clear-cut as, say, pushing coal out of the power market. If Exxon and Chevron want to turn fossil fuels into a ​“clean” product, much of which goes to refining other fossil fuels, is that really advancing the transition to clean energy? It’s already clear, though, that the Gulf hydrogen boom will merge the fossil fuel and clean energy industries in fundamentally new ways. The clean hydrogen economy needs skilled workers to install pipelines, drill storage caverns and handle pressurized gases. A just transition requires a realistic pathway for energy workers to shift to decarbonization; hydrogen could deliver on that promise. Critics call hydrogen a distraction, a boondoggle, a rearguard action by fossil-fuel interests. But developers I spoke to who actually build wind and solar are coming to view hydrogen as a force to unleash untold quantities of renewable generation in the near future. And they’re confident that the falling arc of renewable and electrolyzer costs ultimately will make their clean hydrogen cheaper than a product that requires tinkering with capture equipment and sequestering carbon in perpetuity. If they are right, the Gulf Coast will be reshaped by a new fuel, one that reduces carbon emissions rather than increasing them. The Gulf is already a hydrogen hub — it just isn’t clean yet To understand how hydrogen could be produced cleanly at scale, I needed to see how it’s made currently. I drove east along Houston’s industrial shipping channel, past tanks and tubes and towers, refineries that stretch like cities unto themselves. Billowing smokestacks augmented the low gray clouds pelting rain on the freeway. I plowed through the spray from 18-wheelers and exited the highway into coastal flatlands, scanning for the logo of a 120-year-old French company that’s become a central player in the U.S. hydrogen market. After passing through a series of gates, I alighted at Air Liquide’s La Porte steam methane reforming facility, one of the company’s largest in the world when completed in 2011. Rich Fenza, the company’s director of operations for Gulf Coast hydrogen production and pipeline network, met me in the control center. On the wall of the snack room, I spotted a framed photograph of Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, who visited on her first official trip out of Washington, D.C. Fenza showed me around, pointing out where methane flows in from the natural-gas network and gets scrubbed of any residual sulfur before it rushes into the reformer. That multistory insulated metal box holds 400 catalyst tubes at a temperature of 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Methane and steam flush through pipes until the heat and pressure split them into hydrogen gas, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. The carbon dioxide flies away; the hydrogen goes through a pressure swing absorber that purifies it, before a compressor squeezes it into a bright red pipeline and on to the petrochemical kingdoms of Texas City, Port Arthur, Freeport. The whole agglomeration of tanks, tubes and reformer, collectively called a train, fits in a space not much bigger than a football field. A complex network of pipes and valves brings methane to Air Liquide's reformer unit, which breaks off pure hydrogen gas and vents carbon dioxide as a byproduct. (Julian Spector/Canary Media) Air Liquide oversees a formidable Gulf Coast empire. The company makes 116.5 million standard cubic feet of hydrogen per day at La Porte; three other reformers bring regional total production to 400 million ​“scuffs” each day. It operates 330 miles of hydrogen pipeline to deliver the goods, and it taps its underground salt cavern at Spindletop when it needs to conduct maintenance at production plants or has to meet surges in demand. The cavern, which came online as a hydrogen storage facility in 2016, holds 4.5 billion cubic feet at pressures up to 3,000 pounds per square inch, so when Air Liquide opens a valve, the gas is ready to go. A handful of other legacy suppliers produce and distribute at this level: Air Products, Linde. Some large refineries make their own hydrogen on-site, pumping it directly into refining operations. All of them vent carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Industrial emissions constitute roughly one-third of the greater Houston area’s greenhouse gas pollution, Perlman said; hydrogen produced via methane reforming singlehandedly generates about 25% of those industrial emissions. To reduce carbon emissions, Houston must clean up hydrogen production, and that will require doing something new with that colorless, odorless gas flying out of methane reformers. “Hydrogen has been around for quite some time, so the first step is to take that hydrogen and decarbonize it,” said Matthieu Giard, the French executive who runs Air Liquide’s entire Americas operation from the top floor of a skyscraper west of downtown Houston. Over at Air Liquide’s La Porte site, Fenza added that ​“there’s too much invested in all these plants to just say, ​‘They’re obsolete, let’s shut them all down.’” Fenza’s team won a grant from the DOE to conduct the engineering studies necessary to retrofit La Porte with carbon-capture equipment. The relatively new La Porte site has ample space to host this additional machinery. And Air Liquide has already developed tools that can scrub carbon from a smokestack; it uses similar techniques to isolate other industrial gas products. Carbon capture has been tried many times on power plants, and it typically proves expensive and ineffective. Running capture equipment is energy-intensive, and projects meant to prove the efficacy of the technology have routinely failed to capture as much carbon dioxide from power plant fumes as they were supposed to. Air Liquide, though, has operated its ​“Cryocap H2” technology on a steam methane reformer in Port-Jérôme, France since 2015. Reformers release carbon in a much more concentrated stream than power-plant smokestacks, Giard said, enabling higher-caliber performance (the process requires electricity, which could yield carbon emissions depending on the source). The company says its French facility is able to capture 95% or more of its carbon dioxide output, which Air Liquide then sells. An alternative technique for hydrogen production called autothermal reforming, or ATR, works even better with carbon capture. “It still starts with a hydrocarbon feedstock, but it keeps all the reaction products, including the carbon, at high pressure,” said Fenza. ​“By keeping it at high pressure, [the carbon] is a lot easier to remove.” Giard described ATR technology as ​“something that we can do tomorrow,” but acknowledged the company doesn’t yet operate a full-scale ATR plant. Air Liquide is building one in Japan.

""There's too much invested in all these plants to just say, ‘They're obsolete, let's shut them all down.'""

So while hydrogen with carbon capture hasn’t scaled up yet, Perlman told me ​“it’s an integration issue, not a technology issue.” The industry doesn’t need to invent anything new or wait for dramatic cost reductions. But the carbon still has to go somewhere. Here too, the energy industry has experience. The Gulf already hosts some carbon dioxide pipelines, and the technical details of transporting carbon from a steam methane reformer to storage are well understood. Long-term sequestration similarly relies on existing techniques. “It’s basically production in reverse,” said Kenneth Medlock, senior director of the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University. ​“That’s nothing new; oil and gas producers have been doing that for a long time.” Over the last 50 years, American operators have injected more than 1 billion tons of carbon dioxide underground, said Ben Grove, a geoscientist who tracks carbon sequestration for climate think tank Clean Air Task Force. Most of that went into oil fields to flush out more fossil fuel, a technique known as enhanced oil recovery, but the CO 2 has stayed down there. Oil and gas companies are now focusing on sequestering carbon in areas that don’t have fossil fuel deposits, which earns them a higher tax credit from the Inflation Reduction Act. This entails drilling through nonporous cap rock and pumping carbon down to a porous geological layer, like sandstone, where it squeezes into minuscule gaps in the rock. It turns out, ​“the best storage potential in the country is in the Gulf Coast region — it’s some of the best in the world,” Grove said. Lastly, any industry that depends on methane as a feedstock must confront upstream emissions of the potent greenhouse gas. Independent research has found that methane leakage from wellhead to customer is much higher than previously thought, and unburned methane warms the planet 28 times more than carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. To become truly low-carbon, Houston’s fossil-fueled hydrogen ecosystem would need to eliminate upstream methane emissions, capture almost all emissions from hydrogen production, pump this industrial-scale volume of CO 2 underground, and keep it there, forever. The hydrogen industry has never performed all these steps in sequence. The command center at Air Liquide's La Porte facility governs the flow of hydrogen through pipelines to major petrochemical customers. (Julian Spector/Canary Media) The Gulf isn’t just looking at decarbonizing existing SMRs; economic-development types and energy tycoons alike want to build a bunch of brand-new methane-based hydrogen facilities. After all, if hydrogen becomes the fuel of choice for decarbonizing crucial industrial activities, that will require far more volume than what’s coming out of methane reformers today. This proposed buildout — supported by the DOE hub grant — would lock in additional gas consumption for decades to come, based on the expectation that emissions will be captured and permanently stored. All of this raises the stakes enormously on whether carbon capture works in practice. But that’s not the only path forward for the Gulf’s hydrogen boom. A different cohort of climate-oriented entrepreneurs aims to prove they can make clean hydrogen, cheaply, at scale, while ditching fossil fuels entirely. Renewable megaprojects incoming The pines rise from sandy Mississippi soil, mastlike against the horizon. But where I stand, the timber crop is long gone, leaving a white crust exposed between fluffy-seeded grasses. “Is that the salt?” I ask my hosts, the executive team of Hy Stor. The company plans to use the former logging tract to store vast amounts of renewably powered hydrogen. It turns out I’m a little off. Jill Kinnard, Hy Stor’s senior vice president of land, pipelines and contract management, tells me that the rock-solid salt formation known as the Richton Dome starts roughly 400 feet below us and stretches down thousands of feet beyond that. That’s where the renewably generated hydrogen will go. Some of the most ambitious ideas for clean hydrogen in the Gulf come not from fossil fuel developers but from dyed-in-the-wool green progenitors, using only renewable electricity to create vast amounts of hydrogen. The bigness is a strategic necessity for this form of production, commonly described as ​“green” hydrogen, said Nabil Bennouna, a principal for clean hydrogen at think tank RMI. (Canary Media is an independent affiliate of RMI.) “In order to get green hydrogen to a price that is competitive against alternatives, you need scale,” Bennouna said. ​“If you are interested in having a long-term viable business model, those are the ambitions you need to have.” Before I left Houston, I met a team of developers from Apex Clean Energy at a restaurant a few parking lots over from Air Liquide’s skyscraper. For Apex, ​“Hydrogen is a way to bring more wind and solar online,” said Laura Merten, a policy manager tracking hydrogen for the company. The plan is to build what could be the nation’s biggest renewable power plant, many gigawatts strong, deep in West Texas. There’s no way for that power to reach customers on the Gulf Coast — the grid simply can’t carry that much without woefully expensive upgrades. Apex proposes turning that ideal West Texas wind and sunshine into hydrogen on the spot, then shooting it through a brand-new pipeline, roughly paralleling the Rio Grande, hundreds of miles to the coast. Apex, a veteran wind, solar and battery storage development firm based in Charlottesville, Virginia, has never built a pipeline. But, conveniently, its corporate cousin Epic Midstream has experience running fossil gas pipelines in the region. The Apex Rio project nonetheless represents a tremendous undertaking, which the company hopes to bring online in the latter half of this decade. Over in southern Mississippi, Hy Stor’s vision operates on a similarly grand scale. The company, with just a dozen full-time employees, has acquired rights to nearly 70,000 acres across several counties in a state with almost no renewable power installed today. In just the first phase, Hy Stor will add around 2.7 gigawatts of electrolyzers, powered by twice that capacity of onshore wind, solar and geothermal. This off-grid design ensures that the hydrogen will be clean, a commitment that attracts customers who are serious about decarbonization, CEO Laura Luce told me.

""The best storage potential in the country is in the Gulf Coast region — it’s some of the best in the world.""

But wind and solar produce, famously, not all the time. To neutralize the downsides of this very cheap but intermittent power source, Luce and Co. will pipe their super-clean hydrogen into underground caverns ahead of customer deliveries, then top up the caverns on an ongoing basis as the renewables are used to generate more. Hy Stor is also developing industrial parks for customers who want to turn super-clean hydrogen into things like sustainable fertilizer, green steel, chemicals or maritime fuel. One of these sits 10 miles down the road from the Richton Dome site, on 1,100 acres connected to highway and rail. How does one go about creating massive and cost-effective underground hydrogen storage? Hy Stor first acquired land rights, subsurface rights, water rights and the necessary permits to burrow into that immense, subterranean bulb of salt far below my feet. The plan is to pump down (nonpotable) water from the nearby Leaf River to dissolve the salt and suck out the ensuing brine through a supersized straw. Layer by layer, over about two years, this procedure will excavate a hollow cylinder, hundreds of feet tall but located thousands of feet underground. From where I stood soaking in the slantwise afternoon sun of early December, all I’d be able to see is a fenced-off clearing with some piping protruding from the ground. And that’s just one cavern in one salt dome. Hy Stor has the rights to 10 different salt domes, eight in Mississippi, two in Louisiana. Each dome is large enough to house multiple caverns drilled at safe distances from each other, Luce said, at least 1,000 feet from wellhead to wellhead. Someday not long from now, Hy Stor could be operating hundreds of clean-hydrogen storage caverns, provided the company enlists enough industrial demand to justify that scale of drilling. If that all sounds hard to fathom, Luce points out that she’s drilled storage caverns for natural gas in her career prior to Hy Stor. Some of those caverns occupy portions of the same salt domes Hy Stor is targeting now. “We’re creating something that doesn’t exist, but all the ingredients are there,” Luce said. ​“In Mississippi, you’ve got all the things that are hard to build from scratch.” Like the salt domes. Back at Hy Stor’s office on the Mississippi coast, Luce opened a geological textbook called, fittingly, Salt Domes, and unfurled a map of all the known formations in the Gulf Coast. Scores of them dot the coastal belt, keepsakes of a more tectonically turbulent prehistory. Many have been thoroughly documented because of their tendency to house oil and gas deposits. Hy Stor CEO Laura Luce secured rights to 10 different Gulf Coast salt domes, which can be excavated to store hydrogen gas. At right, Hy Stor's Richton Dome site. (Julian Spector/Canary Media) Making underground caverns to store clean hydrogen fundamentally differs from, say, developing novel long-duration grid batteries to hold clean electricity for days or months. Hy Stor doesn’t need to invent anything or prove some novel combination of technologies. It just has to combine technologies that have already been well proven. There are risks, such as uncertainties around securing the rights to run pipelines to connect electrolyzers with caverns and customers. Having reported on the occasional local opposition to inert solar power plants, I assumed that getting permission to carve up the land to run pipes of combustible gas through it might be challenging. But in Mississippi, pipelines already crisscross the working landscape. I originally met the Hy Stor team at Fulmer’s Farmstead, a bucolic pecan orchard with a general store and meat-and-three lunch service. Kinnard developed dozens of natural gas and carbon dioxide pipelines over a two-decade career before landing at Hy Stor. While filling me in on the finer points of rights of way and surface titles, she mentioned she’d run one pipeline through this very property — over there, between the pecan trees.

""We’re creating something that doesn’t exist, but all the ingredients are there.""

Once you get the necessary permissions, it’s just a matter of digging a trench, covering the pipe with enough dirt to safely drive over, and making sure the landowner doesn’t build on top of it, Kinnard said. She handed me a representative cross-section of the likely hydrogen pipe: PVC, 8-inch diameter, about the same width as a basketball. At one point, as we drove out of the Richton Dome parcel, a Hy Stor member in the car fielded a call from someone responding to a pipeline survey request. The company needs permission to send teams onto people’s property to visually assess where to run the pipe. Pretty soon, the caller was inquiring whether Hy Stor was hiring. The energy industry employs a sizable portion of the workforce in Mississippi, but the state itself no longer produces much oil and gas. That means Mississippians spend their shifts on offshore rigs in the Gulf, or over in the Permian in Texas — far from family and home. Hy Stor pitches a chance to stay put and earn a living with the same skills: drilling, pipeline construction, pressurized gas management. “We can make our own energy in our own backyard — that’s pretty inspiring,” Luce said. Hy Stor plans to hire thousands of workers for construction and hundreds for ongoing operations, paid above the prevailing wage. In Louisiana, the still-dominant oil and gas industry has nonetheless shed thousands of jobs in the last two decades, said Lacy McManus, executive director of future energy at Greater New Orleans, the regional economic development agency. She and other Gulf Coast economic boosters talk about hydrogen production, and related carbon pipelines and sequestration projects, as growth sectors within the energy industry that could boost regional employment. Perlman with the Center for Houston’s Future said that hydrogen ​“could certainly be a big driver of economic growth” for the region in the coming decade. Hy Stor CEO Laura Luce, third from left, and her colleagues are working to pipe pure, clean hydrogen into sustainable industrial parks amid the pines of southern Mississippi. (Julian Spector/Canary Media) But to actually change regional employment prospects, developers like Hy Stor need one more piece of the puzzle to fall into place: firm customer commitments. Before Hy Stor starts drilling its caverns, it has to have prospective buyers lined up who are willing to design and engineer new factories that can receive clean hydrogen from the future caverns. It’s like choreographing an intricate tango while dancing it. Hy Stor has been chasing this vision for several years, with investment from Canadian pension fund Connor, Clark & Lunn. Now, several customers are expected to finalize their factory investments in the first half of 2024, which would give Hy Stor enough certainty to break ground and start delivering carbon-free hydrogen by late 2026 or early 2027. The company can drill more caverns as additional industrial users lock in orders. If contracts fall into place and construction stays on schedule, the long-promised little molecule will flow beneath the Mississippi dirt in just three years. The long game: Which clean hydrogen will win? Dozens of companies are racing to produce low-carbon hydrogen. What isn’t clear is who will win out, and whether this competitive mélange will ultimately lower planet-warming emissions. To properly evaluate carbon impacts, though, analysts need empirical data on operating projects. “There are lots of uncertainties associated with new technologies — we need better data on what the negative path dependencies are for certain production pathways,” said RMI’s Bennouna. The methane-based hydrogen camp has a head start, commercially: Steam methane reformers already operate in the region; companies just need to figure out how to profitably combine them with carbon capture and sequestration. In contrast, renewable electrolysis has only happened at small scale: Air Liquide set a world record when it installed 20 megawatts of electrolyzers in Quebec in 2021. A company called H2B2 claimed the largest renewable electrolysis site in the U.S. when it opened a facility with 3 megawatts of capacity in Fresno late last year, using biogas from a nearby dairy farm. These early projects make liquefied hydrogen for vehicles, in part because they aren’t big enough to serve the industrial customers that get hydrogen delivered via pipeline. Renewable hydrogen developers worry about getting their hands on enough electrolyzers, since the supply chain has never executed at the scale that Gulf Coast entrepreneurs need. They also have to contend with the well-documented obstacles to adding huge amounts of renewables to the grid — hence Hy Stor’s and Apex’s predilection for building off-grid power plants. Air Liquide takes an ecumenical perspective on hydrogen technologies: Its corporate mission is to sell oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen, not hydrocarbons. The company’s portfolio of inventions includes steam methane reformers, autothermal reformers and carbon capture, but it recently opened a factory in Berlin with Germany’s Siemens Energy to mass-produce electrolyzers; it can make 1 gigawatt worth of them per year now, growing to 3 gigawatts by 2025. “Today, if you want to decarbonize very fast, the best way is probably to do some SMR and ATR with carbon capture, because the technology is there, at scale,” Air Liquide’s Giard said. ​“It’s competitive, and the carbon-capture piece is existing in Texas, so that’s fantastic. But let’s not discount electrolysis, because we have a lot of [renewable] energy in Texas.” Electrolysis fans believe plummeting costs for renewables and electrolyzers give them a long-term edge. Both technologies rely on modular, mass-produced building blocks that have been proven to decline in cost predictably over time (see the runaway success of renewables in Texas). SMRs and carbon capture, on the other hand, require large upfront capital investment, and that’s not about to change. If the more bullish visions for renewables come true, clean electrolytic hydrogen will simply become cheaper, putting a damper on the business prospects for new carbon-capture hydrogen. Developers in both camps also need to figure out what kind of infrastructure the Gulf should build to deliver this new product. Regional boosters like to talk up the benefits of the existing pipeline network, but the truth is, those pipelines aren’t open to newcomer hydrogen producers. “We have private-carrier pipelines for ourselves, and so do our colleagues in the industry,” Air Liquide’s Fenza explained. ​“We feel like that’s the best model to really deliver most cost-effectively for the customers and for ourselves.” The pipes run from each producer to the customers who signed bilateral contracts with them. It calls to mind the earliest days of the electric grid, when each power company ran its own wires to customers, shading the streets of New York City with an overlapping mess of redundant wires. Granted, the hydrogen network won’t need to reach as many destinations as the electrical grid. Air Liquide’s Giard assured me the private-carrier model works just fine. “For us, it’s very important to master our universe, A to Z, and make sure that we can provide that very high reliability that [customers] want,” he said. ​“So having a private network is definitely important for us.” The hardcore renewables developers tend to prefer the alternative. ​“We are evaluating overbuilding the capacity of the pipeline to support others injecting,” Merten said of Apex’s West Texas project. ​“The goal is to support and help develop this whole hydrogen economy.” Hy Stor plans to eventually open its pipeline network to others, provided they can guarantee carbon-free hydrogen; the company doesn’t want to jeopardize the high standard it’s pitching to customers. Perlman believes open-access pipelines could expand the overall market for clean hydrogen. He wants to replicate what Louisiana’s Henry Hub did for natural gas: connecting so many different pipelines produced the most dynamic market for gas trading in the country, maybe the world, Perlman explained. “We want to create this market that basically expands, and to do that, we’ll have to have the same sort of interconnected infrastructure,” Perlman said. ​“You want not just physical transactions — you want financial transactions, and you want transparency.” The hitch is, nobody’s developed a framework for regulating hydrogen pipelines, beyond the basic pipeline-safety duties overseen by the U.S. Department of Transportation. The Texas legislature passed a law last year to grant clear hydrogen-pipeline jurisdiction to the Texas Railroad Commission. “Because everything’s bigger in Texas, we have enough pipeline capacity to have our own sort of regulatory jurisdiction, and that’s what we’re trying to do,” Perlman said. The to-do list for hydrogen developers remains daunting: build a facility at a scale the world has never seen and convince large industrial customers to pay an initial green premium for the same commodity; invent new rules of the road for a shared pipeline network that doesn’t exist yet; and outcompete other developers attempting their own version of this novel low-carbon commodity. But the clean energy transition is rife with unresolved challenges: overhauling America’s sclerotic process for permitting transmission lines, figuring out how to store renewable power far longer than any battery has before, unlocking the secret of nuclear fusion to power humanity. Compared to those tasks, inventing a clean hydrogen economy in the Gulf doesn’t look so gnarly. Many of the steps, like making the perfect storage vessel thousands of feet below the earth, have been done before, repeatedly. The region knows how to vigorously exploit a hydrocarbon energy boom; it just needs to unleash the hydro, but hold the carbon.

(Reuters) -Europe's benchmark stock index snapped a four-day winning streak on Tuesday, weighed down by basic resources and energy stocks, while French industrial gases firm Air Liquide jumped to an all-time high after hiking its 2025 margin target.

The continent-wide STOXX 600 closed 0.1% lower, after ending at a two-year high on Monday and nearing a record high, supported by upbeat earnings from industry heavyweights and expectations of more than four rate cuts this year.

Basic resources shed 1.8%, with investors' demand for more support for China's economy capping gains in copper prices after a deeper-than-expected mortgage rate cut by the world's top metals consumer. Energy dropped 1.1% as oil prices fell on an uncertain global demand outlook.

Leading sectoral losses, technology lost 1.7%, with software firm Temenos sliding 5.6% after forecasting slower earnings growth in 2024.

On the flip side, Air Liquide surged 8.3% on doubling its 2025 margin target following a better-than-expected annual operating profit, booting the chemicals sector 2.5% higher to a seven-week high.

Meanwhile, European Central Bank data showed negotiated euro zone wage growth slowed in 2023 final quarter, confirming expectations that pay growth has peaked although it remains far above a level consistent with 2% inflation. The data is seen as an important variable in determining the timing of rate cuts.

""Even if this increase was slightly lower than in the third quarter, the all-clear cannot be given,"" Commerzbank's senior economist Marco Wagner said in a note.

""Existing wage agreements analysed by the ECB indicate that wage growth will remain high in the current year. In addition, the proportion of companies expecting price increases is rising again.""

Among other top movers, Barclays added 8.6% after laying out a three-year plan to revive flagging share price including axing 2 billion pounds of costs, returning 10 billion pounds ($12.6 billion) to shareholders and investing in its high-returning UK bank.

Story continues

IHG climbed 5.4% after the Holiday Inn-owner posted slightly better-than-expected annual room revenue and said it expected to return more than $1 billion to shareholders in 2024.

Auto parts supplier Forvia extended its decline, down 21% in two days, after announcing job cut plans for Europe.

Renault declined 4.2% after data showed the French carmaker's total registrations fell 2.9% in January.

German dialysis specialist Fresenius Medical Care dropped 4.5% as analysts highlighted a weak outlook for patient volumes.

Out of the STOXX 600 companies that have reported fourth-quarter earnings to date, 54.1% exceeded estimates, in line with the typical beat rate, LSEG data showed.

Favorite

Air Liquide and Sasol have recently entered into fresh Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with Enel Green Power RSA, securing a long-term supply of an additional 110 MW of renewable power to Sasol’s Secunda site in South Africa. This marks the fourth series of PPAs signed by both entities since their initial agreements in 2023. Collectively, these PPAs now account for a total renewable power capacity of approximately 690 MW.

For Air Liquide, these contracts are expected to result in an annual reduction of approximately 1.2 million tonnes in CO2 emissions, aligning with the company’s targeted reduction of 30% to 40% of CO2 emissions associated with oxygen production in Secunda by 2031.

As part of the agreement, Enel Green Power will establish a local entity committed to socio-economic development, tasked with constructing a wind farm in the Eastern Cape province. The anticipated operational launch of this renewable energy production facility is set for 2026.

Nicolas Poirot, Chief Executive Officer of Africa Middle-East & India, said: “These new renewable electricity

supply agreements are yet another sign of our strong joint commitment to decarbonize the production of

oxygen in Secunda since Air Liquide took over Sasol’s units in 2021. These long-term contracts will actively

support the development of renewable energy in South Africa, for the benefit of the country’s electrical

system and ultimately of the South African society in the context of a Just Transition.”

Air Liquide completed the acquisition of Sasol’s 16 oxygen production units in Secunda in June 2021, under a long-term supply agreement with its partner. Adding to the ASU it previously operated for Sasol, Air Liquide now oversees a total of 17 ASUs in Secunda, boasting a combined oxygen capacity of 47,000 tonnes per day. To mitigate environmental impact, Air Liquide intends to slash CO2 emissions (Scope 2) from the acquired units by 30% to 40%. This will be achieved through a comprehensive investment and modernization program spanning several years, coupled with a significant increase in the procurement of renewable energies for the site.

Mexico’s government has ordered the expropriation of a hydrogen plant at a Pemex oil refinery that was sold to French company Air Liquide during the previous administration, after officials ordered a temporary occupation of the facility last December.

The expropriation announcement from Mexico’s energy ministry was published in the government’s official gazette late on Thursday, citing risks to motor fuels production at the Tula refinery, owned and operated by state-run Pemex, due to the third-party supply of hydrogen.

Oil refineries use hydrogen to reduce the sulfur content in petroleum products, especially diesel.

The government’s announcement also cited the need to ensure Mexico’s “energy sovereignty” via the expropriation of the privately-operated facility.

Air Liquide (AIRP.PA), opens new tab, an industrial gases and services company, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The expropriation order noted that the firm has 15 days from its publication to present its response to the ministry’s legal office.

Since he took office in late 2018, leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has sought to concentrate more control over the country’s energy sector in the hands of Pemex as well as state electricity company CFE.

He has also made domestic production of gasoline and diesel a top priority, arguing against Mexico’s longstanding dependence on foreign imports.

Under his predecessor, centrist former President Enrique Pena Nieto, Pemex’s refining arm signed a 20-year contract with Air Liquide in 2017 to supply hydrogen for Tula’s operations in a bid to lower costs and boost efficiency.

The Tula facility, located in central Hidalgo state north of the Mexican capital, is Pemex’s second-largest refinery currently in operation.

When the temporary occupation of the Air Liquide plant was ordered in December, the government said Pemex should compensate the French firm, but the latest order did not mention any payment.

Why are cookies useful?

We use functional cookies to analyse how visitors use our website, as well as track and improve our website’s performance and function. This allows us to provide a high-quality customer experience by quickly identifying and fixing any issues that may arise. For example, we might use cookies to keep track of which website pages are most popular and which method of linking between website pages is most effective. The latter also helps us to track if you were referred to us by another website and improve our future advertising campaigns.

Another use of cookies is to store your log in sessions, meaning that when you log in to the Members Area to deposit funds, a ""session cookie"" is set so that the website remembers that you have already logged in. If the website did not set this cookie, you will be asked for your login and password on each new page as you progress through the funding process.

In addition, functional cookies, for example, are used to allow us to remember your preferences and identify you as a user, ensure your information is secure and operate more reliably and efficiently.

Enel Green Power signs large-scale South Africa commercial renewable energy deal - Creamer Media's Engineering News,"Mon, 26 Feb 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lbmdpbmVlcmluZ25ld3MuY28uemEvYXJ0aWNsZS9lbmVsLWdyZWVuLXBvd2VyLXNpZ25zLWxhcmdlLXNjYWxlLXNvdXRoLWFmcmljYS1jb21tZXJjaWFsLXJlbmV3YWJsZS1lbmVyZ3ktZGVhbC0yMDI0LTAyLTI20gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Renewable energy company Enel Green Power South Africa has signed three long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with industrial gases company Air Liquide South Africa and energy and chemicals company Sasol to supply 330 MW of renewable energy to Sasol’s Secunda site, where Air Liquide operates its large-scale oxygen production facility.

Enel Green Power and sovereign wealth fund the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) jointly own Enel Green Power South Africa.

The 330 MW of renewable energy will be generated by three joint venture-owned wind projects in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa and are expected to be operational by 2026.

This 330 MW cluster complements the company's existing platform of more than 730 MW already in operation and is expected to result in a yearly production of more than 1 100 GWh.

Enel Green Power South Africa is, therefore, one of the first renewable energy companies to conclude a set of large-scale wind PPAs in South Africa for the commercial and industrial market, the companies said.

Further, the PPA announcement also marks the first project developed entirely under the umbrella of the joint venture between Enel Green Power and QIA since they entered into a partnership to build and operate renewable energy plants in sub-Saharan Africa.

The partnership is aligned with QIA’s commitment to support the global transition to a low-carbon future and strengthens Enel Green Power as a major renewable energy supplier in South Africa as it continues discussions with other offtakers to increase energy capacity, which will consolidate its position in the renewable energy industry."
