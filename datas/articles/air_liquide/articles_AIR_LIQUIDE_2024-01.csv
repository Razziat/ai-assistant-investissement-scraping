The decree, signed by President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, states that the plant should be occupied ""immediately"" by Pemex's industrial arm, known as Pemex TRI.

Pemex partnered with Air Liquide in 2017 for the latter to supply it with hydrogen for 20 years, in an attempt by the then Mexican government to reduce costs for the state-owned oil company.

In the contract at the time, it was agreed that Air Liquide would operate the refinery's existing plant and invest in a second plant to supply the total hydrogen required for expansion projects at the refinery in Tula, in Hidalgo state, one of Pemex's largest.

According to the decree published in the Official Gazette, the payment made by Pemex for the hydrogen ""increases the costs of supplying hydrogen at low levels of crude processing"", which is not profitable for the state-owned company.

It also states that Pemex TRI will have to cover the compensation required by law, but does not detail the amount of such compensation.

Air Liquide did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters."

Earnings Not Telling The Story For L'Air Liquide S.A. (EPA:AI) - Simply Wall St,"Sun, 07 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3NpbXBseXdhbGwuc3Qvc3RvY2tzL2ZyL21hdGVyaWFscy9lcGEtYWkvbGFpci1saXF1aWRlLXNoYXJlcy9uZXdzL2Vhcm5pbmdzLW5vdC10ZWxsaW5nLXRoZS1zdG9yeS1mb3ItbGFpci1saXF1aWRlLXNhLWVwYWFp0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"L'Air Liquide S.A.'s ( ) price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 28.1x might make it look like a strong sell right now compared to the market in France, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios below 14x and even P/E's below 8x are quite common. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.

With earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, L'Air Liquide has been doing relatively well. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price.

Is There Enough Growth For L'Air Liquide?

Want the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our will help you uncover what's on the horizon.

L'Air Liquide's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.

Retrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 20% gain to the company's bottom line. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 39% overall rise in EPS, aided by its short-term performance. So we can start by confirming that the company has done a great job of growing earnings over that time.

Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 9.8% each year over the next three years. With the market predicted to deliver 11% growth per annum, the company is positioned for a comparable earnings result.

With this information, we find it interesting that L'Air Liquide is trading at a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly average growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.

The Bottom Line On L'Air Liquide's P/E

While the price-to-earnings ratio shouldn't be the defining factor in whether you buy a stock or not, it's quite a capable barometer of earnings expectations.

Our examination of L'Air Liquide's analyst forecasts revealed that its market-matching earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E as much as we would have predicted. Right now we are uncomfortable with the relatively high share price as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. Unless these conditions improve, it's challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.

Don't forget that there may be other risks. For instance, we've identified that you should be aware of.

Total and Air Liquide launch hydrogen mobility joint venture with plans to build 100 filling stations in Europe - Hydrogen Insight,"Tue, 30 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oeWRyb2dlbmluc2lnaHQuY29tL3RyYW5zcG9ydC90b3RhbC1hbmQtYWlyLWxpcXVpZGUtbGF1bmNoLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLW1vYmlsaXR5LWpvaW50LXZlbnR1cmUtd2l0aC1wbGFucy10by1idWlsZC0xMDAtZmlsbGluZy1zdGF0aW9ucy1pbi1ldXJvcGUvMi0xLTE1OTA1NzDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French oil major TotalEnergies and industrial gases firm Air Liquide have today announced the formal launch of their 50-50 joint venture (JV) for hydrogen refuelling, Teal Mobility.

The new company plans to have 20 stations up and running by the end of this year and already lists 15 incumbent Total hydrogen refuelling stations on its website.

Teal Mobility aims to build out 100 H 2 filling stations over the next ten years to serve heavy-duty fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) — as the two companies stated almost a year ago when they first announced plans for the JV.

While the market for hydrogen passenger cars has been on the downturn in Europe, with its largest market Germany seeing nearly 70% fewer registrations in 2023 than the year before, H 2 is widely expected to play a major role in decarbonising trucks.

These vehicles are considered difficult to electrify, since they need to travel a longer distance between stops and refuel quicker than most batteries today can accommodate. Batteries can also add to the weight of the truck and reduce payload, but some industry observers believe that fully electric trucks will eventually become the mainstay of the road freight sector due to cheaper running costs.

In the short term, trucking firms in Europe have been hesitant to buy FCEVs, partly because hydrogen refuelling infrastructure is extremely limited, and partly because operating costs are still lower with diesel vehicles.

Article continues below the advert

The EU passed its Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation last year, which mandates that publicly accessible gaseous H 2 filling stations capable of serving both heavy-duty and light vehicles are set up in every “urban node” and every 200km along the core routes of the planned Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) by 2030. This is expected to result in hundreds of new stations being installed across Europe.

Teal Mobility specifies on its website that its hydrogen refuelling sites will be “located on major European corridors (TEN-T)”.

The joint venture also appears to suggest it will supply both green and blue hydrogen, noting that its name represents a blend of “the most sought-after colors of hydrogen”. It is also an acronym of the two companies’ names.

While the EU has strictly legislated on green H 2 , with targets and subsidies currently specifying the use of “renewable fuels of non-biological origin” as defined in the delegated acts, it has not yet set out any further policy on the use of low-carbon hydrogen.

However, blue H 2 produced from natural gas with carbon capture and storage is generally predicted to be cheaper than green in the short term, while still theoretically contributing to emissions reduction if upstream methane leakage is low.

Hydrogen Insight has reached out to Teal Mobility to confirm whether green and blue hydrogen will be clearly differentiated in supply to customers.

TotalEnergies and Air Liquide are also two of the founding companies behind H2 Mobility, a German refuelling station operator."

The agency announced this week it has selected 11 council members to serve alongside Railroad Commission Chairman Christi Craddick. The first meeting was held in mid-December.



“Hydrogen is blowing and going in Texas, to say the least,” Susan Shifflett, executive director of the Texas Hydrogen Alliance.



Speaking with the Reporter-Telegram by telephone, she noted that representatives of five of her association's members — GTI Energy, Port of Corpus Christi, Chevron, CenterPoint Energy and Air Liquide — are on the council. The goal, she added, is to receive guidance on transporting, distributing and storing hydrogen.



Under the legislation, House Bill 2847, the council is tasked with making recommendations to the Legislature on updates necessary for the oversight and regulation of production, pipeline transportation and storage of hydrogen. Duties will include developing a state plan for hydrogen production oversight by the commission, analyzing the development of hydrogen industries around the state and monitoring regional efforts for the application and development of a clean hydrogen hub authorized under the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.



Shifflett said the recent selection of the Houston region for a federal Gulf Coast hydrogen hub, with $1.2 billion in federal funding available, is just the beginning of hydrogen development in Texas. Multinational majors like ExxonMobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips are looking at hydrogen and the effort is also attracting smaller companies and entrepreneurs.

Analyzing 2024 Opportunities in 3 Chemical Stocks - StockNews.com,"Wed, 03 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vc3RvY2tuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcXV5LWFsYi1uZXUtYnVsbGlzaC1vci1iZWFyaXNoLWFuYWx5emluZy0yMDI0LW9wcG9ydHVuaXRpZXMtaW4tMy1jaGVtaWNhbC1zdG9ja3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The chemical industry is growing due to increased demand from key sectors like automotive, construction, agriculture, healthcare, and electronics, especially in emerging markets. The industry is offering lucrative investment opportunities driven by heightened demand, government initiatives, and technological advancements in critical end-use industries.

However, for reasons discussed throughout this article, I believe Albemarle Corp. (ALB) should be best avoided at the moment, while it could be prudent to keep an eye on L’Air Liquide S.A. ADR (AIQUY) for an attractive entry point. On the other hand, it could be wise to buy NewMarket Corp (NEU) to capitalize on the industry tailwinds.

Before diving deeper into their fundamentals, let’s discuss what’s shaping the chemical industry’s prospects.

After the post-pandemic rebound, the chemical industry found itself under pressure last year due to a rise in energy and feedstock costs, pricing pressure, a smaller-than-expected rebound in China, and reduced profit margins.

This year, the chemical industry anticipates growth in demand for chemicals supporting the energy transition, driven by positive economic effects. Innovations in environmentally friendly products, coupled with data analytics and AI adoption, are providing a competitive edge to chemical companies.

Government policies post-pandemic, such as the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act, have allocated substantial funds and incentives to key sectors vital for the energy transition, including EV, semiconductors, and lithium-ion batteries.

These initiatives will boost the demand for chemicals and materials as they will be crucial to support the energy transition. As a result, the global chemical market is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 8.8% until 2032.

Moreover, there is a substantial demand for specialty chemicals as they are designed for specific and niche applications. Driven by the demand to enhance product strength, durability, and efficiency, as well as the ability to create new applications, the specialty chemicals market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 7% until 2027. This growth will be propelled by increased demand in the agrochemical sector, recycled plastics, and construction chemicals.

Furthermore, digital technology is reshaping the strategic landscape for chemical manufacturers, enabling the use of various tools to innovate materials and streamline cost-effective formulations through the assessment, optimization, and integration of ingredient recipes and domain knowledge.

Considering these conducive trends, let’s analyze the fundamentals of the three Chemicals stocks, beginning with the third from the investment point of view.

Stock #3: Albemarle Corp. (ALB)

ALB develops, manufactures, and markets engineered specialty chemicals worldwide. It operates through three segments: Lithium, Bromine, and Catalysts.

In terms of the trailing-12-month asset turnover ratio, ALB’s 0.60x is 14% lower than the 0.70x industry average.

ALB’s net sales for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023, came in at $2.31 billion. The company’s adjusted net income attributable to ALB decreased 63.5% year-over-year to $322.59 million.

Mexican Government Carries Out Expropriation of Hydrogen Plant - Clyde & Co,"Mon, 08 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNseWRlY28uY29tL2VuL2luc2lnaHRzLzIwMjQvMDEvbWV4aWNhbi1nb3Zlcm5tZW50LWNhcnJpZXMtb3V0LWV4cHJvcHJpYXRpb24tb2YtaHnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On 29 December 2023, the Mexican Government by Means of the Ministry of Energy issued an expropriation of a Hydrogen Production plant located inside the Tula Refinery on the state of Hidalgo, this decree by itself outlies a change in criteria from the current Mexican Government regarding hydrogen which we will explain in detail below:

Background

According to the expropriation Decree (the Decree) the hydrogen plant in question was purchased by the Company Air Liquide Mexico S. de R.L. (a Mexican subsidiary of a French company) by a sale and purchase agreement executed by and between Air Liquide Mexico S. de R.L. de C.V and Pemex Industrial Transformation (Pemex), while the land where the plant was located was granted on gratuitous bailment to Air Liquide by Pemex.

The hydrogen was used to operate the processing plants of the Tula Refinery and produce gasoline and diesel. Consequently (according to the Decree) the hydrogen was fundamental for the operation of the Tula Refinery and consequently it was decided by the Mexican Government that in order to guarantee the production at the refinery and guarantee the supply of hydrogen ( in the outlook on an increase in demand of the same worldwide) it was necessary to proceed with the expropriation of the hydrogen plant.

Analysis of the Decree

Once established the above, it is necessary to analyze the content of the decree in order to establish the content of the same that gives us a glimpse of the policy of the government towards hydrogen generation.

1. The Mexican Government is acknowledging the importance of Hydrogen and is considering a relevant part of the energy mix.

After years of little to no mention of hydrogen and its relevance in the production of energy and ammonia for fertilizers the Mexican Government is acknowledging in the Decree that hydrogen be a fundamental component in the energy basket for the country.

This can act as a double edge sword, since the current government (and possibly the new one if the ruling party wins the elections that will take place next June) can take a more protectionist approach towards the generation of hydrogen, seeking to benefit Pemex and the state run electric company (CFE) making more difficult for the companies to invest directly on the sector.

2. The Mexican Government seeks to incorporate clean energy generation as part of Pemex activities

Among the reasons provided as cause for the expropriation is the fact that the technology of the Hydrogen Generation Plant will allow Pemex to develop new facilities that will allow for production of clean energies.

However, it is important to consider that the fact that this hydrogen plant was expropriated does not entail a generalized risk for hydrogen producers in country, since, the way this particular plant was operating provided the perfect combination of circumstances for the same to be expropriated for the reasons outlined below:

1. The Hydrogen Plant was operating inside a Pemex Complex.

The refinery of Tula Hidalgo is owned and operated by Pemex such is the case that the plant was operating in land on gratuitous bailment by Pemex.

2. The Hydrogen plant was directly related to hydrocarbons processing which is considered an activity essential for national security.

The ground for the expropriation and the reason why the expropriation decree was issued by the Ministry of Energy is not because the Mexican Government has the ownership of the hydrogen produced in the country, since, as of the date of this article hydrogen is not considered property of the nation or an industry of strategic priority as it is the production of Hydrocarbons. Hence, the grounds that were used by the Ministry of Energy to carry out the expropriation were that the hydrogen was used to produced refined products that are under their purview and are considered essential for national security.

3. The land where the plant was located was not owned by the hydrogen producer.

As mentioned above the land where the hydrogen plant was located is inside the Tula Refinery and owned by Pemex, hence in order to carry out the expropriation it was only necessary for Pemex to terminate the gratuitous bailment agreement and for Pemex to pay the cost of the hydrogen plant.

Conclusion

Even if the fact that a hydrogen plant was expropriated, is not good news for the hydrogen industry in Mexico, it is important to consider that this expropriation was carried out in very specific circumstances which allowed this expropriation to be carried out.

"Carbon capture technology has its critics, but it can radically reduce emissions in this one industry - Equities News","Thu, 04 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lcXVpdGllcy5jb20vaW1wYWN0LWludmVzdGluZy9jYXJib24tY2FwdHVyZS10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWhhcy1pdHMtY3JpdGljcy1idXQtaXQtY2FuLXJhZGljYWxseS1yZWR1Y2UtZW1pc3Npb25zLWluLXRoaXMtb25lLWluZHVzdHJ5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"World leaders gathered Nov. 30 for the annual UN climate meeting known as COP28. A key climate solution that was discussed was carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), a technology that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions from hard-to-decarbonize sectors.

COP28’s president, Sultan Ahmed Al-Jaber, who is both the COP president and CEO of UAE oil giant Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. (ADNOC), has been campaigning for carbon capture technologies as a way to reduce emissions.

A month before, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act, which increased federal tax incentives for carbon capture projects. The goal is to stimulate more investment in carbon capture technologies that were previously unprofitable.

How does CCUS work?

CCUS refers to three main technologies: 1. Post-combustion carbon capture is the most common technology used today. It collects smokestack emissions, called flue gases, before they can be released into the air. 2. Pre-combustion capture, which removes carbon dioxide from the fuel source before its fully burned. 3. Oxy-fuel combustion capture, which is when fuel is burned in an atmosphere of nearly pure oxygen, producing highly concentrated carbon dioxide that is easier to collect.

In sum: Those technologies work to capture CO2 generated by burning fossil fuels before emissions are released to the atmosphere.

Capture generally takes place at large stationary sources of CO2, including power plants, and cement, steel or chemical facilities. Simply stated, most current carbon capture projects use a liquid to chemically remove, or separate, CO2 from other gases produced. Then the CO2 is compressed and transported via pipelines, road transport or shipped offsite for storage. Finally, the CO2 is injected into rock formations deep underground for permanent storage.

CCUS is touted as an essential technological tool required for a low carbon future. Nearly all the models in the 2022 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report include carbon capture to keep the earth to 1.5 Celsius degrees of warming. Regardless of these models and the political fanfare behind CCUS, there are many critiques that must be considered from both an environmental and investor perspective.

IS CCUS effective?

From an environmental perspective, many organizations are skeptical of its use, arguing that while carbon capture can decarbonize hard-to-abate industries, the actualized carbon capture is limited. According to Global Status of CCS 2022, referenced in a May 2023 Bloomberg article, “Despite its 50-year history, all the CCS plants deployed globally capture only about 40 million tons of CO2 each year. That’s less than 0.1% of global greenhouse-gas emissions.”

The IEA reports a similar metric saying that in 2022, 40 commercial capture facilities are in operation globally, and these facilities have an annual capture capacity of approximately 45 MT CO2. According to Brad Page, CEO of Global CCS Institute, “This must increase at least 100-fold by 2050 to meet the scenarios laid out by the IPCC.”

Returning to the topic of COP28 President Al-Jaber and his oil company ADNOC, Global Witness said that “it would take his oil company over 340 years to remove the CO2 it will produce by 2030.”

Calamos’ view

Calamos’ Sustainable Equities Team holds a cautious outlook on the role CCUS will play in lowering emissions from traditional fossil fuel production and generation facilities. This hesitation stems from CCUS’s energy intensiveness, high costs and availability of other low-carbon options such as wind and solar.

Yet we do believe there is an area, the industrial sector, which accounts for one-quarter of CO2 emissions and 40% of global energy demand, where CCUS can play a valuable role in reducing emissions. The industrial sector is involved in the production of materials such as cement, steel and chemicals, areas that are highly carbon intensive yet do not currently have other decarbonization options available (i.e. wind or solar).

According to the IEA, in the Clean Technology Scenario (CTS), more than 28 billion tonnes of CO2 is captured from industrial facilities in the period to 2060. In this scenario, CCUS delivers 38% of the emissions reductions needed in the chemical subsector and 15% in both cement, iron and steel.

Recognizing this growth opportunity, the Sustainable Equities Team has identified companies, such as Air Liquide AIQUY , as being highly innovative and fundamentally competitive in this space. Air Liquide’s Cryocap technology involves the use of extremely low temperature to separate gases. For the cement industry, Cryocap FG can achieve CO2 capture rate of 85 to 95%, while Cryocap Steel achieves a CO2 capture rate of 80 to 95%.

In April 2022, Air Liquide and EQIOM (a subsidiary of CRH CRH , the leading building materials business in the world) partnered on a project titled “K6” with the aim to transform EQIOM’s Lumbres cement plant into one of the first carbon-neutral cement plants in Europe.

About Gevo

Gevo’s mission is to transform renewable energy and carbon into energy-dense liquid hydrocarbons. These liquid hydrocarbons can be used for drop-in transportation fuels such as gasoline, jet fuel and diesel fuel, that when burned have potential to yield net-zero greenhouse gas emissions when measured across the full life cycle of the products. Gevo uses low-carbon renewable resource-based carbohydrates as raw materials and is in an advanced state of developing renewable electricity and renewable natural gas for use in production processes, resulting in low-carbon fuels with substantially reduced carbon intensity (the level of greenhouse gas emissions compared to standard petroleum fossil-based fuels across their life cycle). Gevo’s products perform as well or better than traditional fossil-based fuels in infrastructure and engines, but with substantially reduced greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to addressing the problems of fuels, Gevo’s technology also enables certain plastics, such as polyester, to be made with more sustainable ingredients. Gevo’s ability to penetrate the growing low-carbon fuels market depends on the price of oil and the value of abating carbon emissions that would otherwise increase greenhouse gas emissions. Gevo believes that its proven, patented technology enabling the use of a variety of low-carbon sustainable feedstocks to produce price-competitive low-carbon products such as gasoline components, jet fuel and diesel fuel yields the potential to generate project and corporate returns that justify the build-out of a multi-billion-dollar business.

Gevo believes that the Argonne National Laboratory GREET model is the best available standard of scientific-based measurement for life cycle inventory or LCI.

The purpose is to develop the supply chain within the budding carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) industry. The EU aims to store at least 400 million tons of CO2 per year by mid-century, but not everything would be put away underground permanently.

The presentation of the European Union’s carbon management strategy is scheduled for February 6. It deems CO2 capture and storage – CCS, or CCUS when utilization is included – necessary to achieve climate targets. The technology is far from mature and a market is still just an idea. But they are especially relevant for the decarbonization of so-called hard-to-abate industries like cement and steel.

The European Commission aims to set a target for CO2 sequestration in 2050 to 450 million tons, Euractiv learned. The goal for 2030 would be 50 million tons.

In the meantime, the 27-country bloc’s executive body just approved EUR 594 million in grants from the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) for eight cross-border energy infrastructure investments.

They were declared projects of common interest (PCI) in 2022. Five are for carbon transportation and storage, but they are eligible for up to EUR 480 million. The purpose is to develop an EU-wide carbon value chain.

D’Artagnan CO2 infrastructure project grabs third of new funding package

The D’Artagnan project for a CO2 export hub in the port of Dunkirk in France is receiving up to EUR 189 million. The PCI involves setting up a network for the collection of the greenhouse gas.

It aims to connect, by ships and a pipeline, the main industrial emitters in Dunkirk harbor and its hinterland with key CCS projects under development in the North Sea and the Netherlands for permanent storage. The plan includes infrastructure in the port of Rotterdam. Air Liquide France Industrie, Dunkerque LNG, EQIOM, Lhoist and RTE are part of the endeavor.

The EU also awarded EUR 157 million for CO2 infrastructure in the port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands. It includes an import terminal and 200 kilometers of undersea trunkline. The Aramis project, which received EUR 124 million, is for transporting anthropogenic and biogenic CO2 for permanent geological storage in depleted gas reservoirs in the North Sea.

Several emitters would transport captured CO2 to the main onshore hub at Rotterdam port via shipping and onshore pipelines. The member states involved in the Aramis project are the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Germany.

The Northern Lights initiative, launched in Norway, is heading toward its next chapter

Accessible offshore storage sites can provide over 400 million tonnes of CO2 storage capacity, according to the documentation. The system is scheduled to start operations in early 2026. The remaining EUR 33 million is for CO2next, a project for an import terminal.

The Northern Lights initiative received EUR 131 million. It is a cross-border project linking future CO2 capture facilities in several EU member states and Norway. The EU CCS Interconnector, a CO2 infrastructure project in Gdańsk in Poland, was awarded EUR 2.5 million.

Of note, the Porthos project, located in the port of Rotterdam, too, is the only big CCS endeavor past a final investment decision.

Half of captured CO2 envisaged for production of e-fuels, synthetic materials

The European Commission’s draft reportedly includes an annual target of 100 to 200 million tons of CO2 to be captured not from industrial emissions, but directly from the atmosphere.

The EU executive’s draft assessment of the impact on the climate targets for 2040 shows that 26 to 41 million tons of CO2 would need to be captured per year from power plants that burn fossil fuels, according to Table.Media. The news outlet added that the projection climbs to 50 million tons from 2050. It is part of the target of 450 million tons.

Only 247 million of 453 million tons are planned to be put away permanently, in geological storage

At least 136 million tons would need to be sequestered from industrial processes per year. It compares to 232 million tons from bioenergy (plants) with carbon capture and storage – BECCS, and direct air carbon capture and storage – DACCS, the article adds. Upgrading biogas to biomethane will result in 30 million tons of CO2 envisaged to be captured every year.

The plan involves storing 247 million tons of carbon dioxide underground (permanently). Another 147 million tons would be used per year to produce synthetic fuels, also known as e-fuels. The production of synthetic materials accounts for 59 million tons, according to the report."
Turbotech and Safran test first hydrogen turboprop for light aircraft - Hydrogen Central,"Mon, 29 Jan 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vaHlkcm9nZW4tY2VudHJhbC5jb20vdHVyYm90ZWNoLWFuZC1zYWZyYW4tdGVzdC1maXJzdC1oeWRyb2dlbi10dXJib3Byb3AtZm9yLWxpZ2h0LWFpcmNyYWZ0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Turbotech and Safran test first hydrogen turboprop for light aircraft.

– Turbotech and Safran have successfully tested the first hydrogen-fueled gas turbine engine for the light aviation market.

– The tests at ArianeGroup’s facility in Vernon, France, are part of the BeautHyFuel project to explore hydrogen propulsion solutions for light airplanes. BeautHyFuel is supported by the French Civil Aviation Authority (DGAC) as part of France’s post-Covid stimulus program and is led by Turbotech and Elixir Aircraft in partnership with Safran, Air Liquide and Daher.

– The project leverages ArianeGroup’s decades-long experience with hydrogen propulsion for the Ariane rocket.

On January 11, Turbotech and Safran successfully completed the first test of a hydrogen-fueled aero gas turbine engine with ultra-high performance regenerative cycle. The test was made possible by ArianeGroup’s resources and decades of expertise in preparing and performing tests with hydrogen fuels for space applications at its Vernon test facility in France.

This initial trial was carried out using hydrogen fuel stored in gaseous form. In a second phase later this year, the engine will be coupled to a cryogenic liquid storage system developed by Air Liquide to demonstrate the end-to-end integration of a propulsion system replicating all functions on a complete aircraft.

Damien Fauvet, CEO of Turbotech, said:

This first experiment carried out using a Turbotech TP-R90 regenerative turboprop engine shows we can convert previously proven internal combustion technologies to create a working zero-carbon solution for general aviation.

“As we move to liquid hydrogen fuel, the aim is to offer a high energy-density propulsion system with real commercial applications. Our solution will be readily retrofittable on light airplanes and could have potential in other market segments.”

Pierre-Alain Lambert, VP Hydrogen Programs for Safran, said:

This first stage of the project has already gone beyond our expectations.

“Our objective was to validate the behavior of the engine and fuel control system at all phases, from engine start to full throttle, as well as strategies in the event of a failure. For Safran, this kind of small-scale investigation is really valuable, because we can learn quickly and nimbly. It complements our other, larger-scale initiatives aimed at removing the barriers to hydrogen propulsion for air transport, such as our technology demonstration in partnership with CFM International[1] as part of Airbus’s ZEROe program, supported by Clean Aviation. ArianeGroup’s expertise in hydrogen testing was decisive in the timely success of this crucial first step.”

Turbotech, Elixir Aviation, Safran, Air Liquide and Daher formed the BeautHyFuel joint research project in June 2022 to design and ground test a hydrogen propulsion system rated for light aviation and develop a methodology so it can be certified for retrofit. BeautHyFuel benefits from the unique combination of Turbotech’s ultra-efficient light turbine technologies, Safran’s expertise as an aeroengine manufacturer and fuel system designer, Air Liquide’s cryogenic hydrogen storage technologies for aerospace, Elixir’s role as a manufacturer of innovative fourth-generation light planes, and Daher’s experience in aircraft development, certification, production and maintenance.

The BeautHyFuel project is supported by the French government and DGAC through France’s post-pandemic stimulus program. It complements other initiatives by Safran to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of air transport.
