"Amid global electric-car buzz, Toyota bullish on hydrogen - Phys.org","Thu, 16 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDE3LTExLWdsb2JhbC1lbGVjdHJpYy1jYXItdG95b3RhLWJ1bGxpc2gtaHlkcm9nZW4uaHRtbNIBTWh0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDE3LTExLWdsb2JhbC1lbGVjdHJpYy1jYXItdG95b3RhLWJ1bGxpc2gtaHlkcm9nZW4uYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In this Oct. 30, 2017, photo, workers of Toyota Motor Corp. set hydrogen-stored tanks, in yellow, to be placed into a Mirai fuel cell vehicle at the automaker's Motomachi plant, in Toyota, western Japan.

At a car factory in this city named after Toyota, the usual robots with their swinging arms are missing. Instead, workers intently fit parts into place by hand with craftsmanship-like care.

The big moment on the assembly line comes when two bulbous yellow tanks of hydrogen are rolled over and delicately fitted into each car's underside.

While much of the world is going gung-ho for electric vehicles to help get rid of auto emissions and end reliance on fossil fuels, Japan's top automaker Toyota Motor Corp. is banking on hydrogen.

Toyota sells about 10 million vehicles a year around the world. It has sold only about 4,000 Mirai fuel cell vehicles since late 2014, roughly half of them outside Japan.

The Mirai, which means ""future,"" is not cheap at $57,500, but Toyota loses money on each one. Still, the company's goal is to sell 30,000 fuel-cell vehicles a year by about 2020.

Hydrogen fuel cells don't suffer the EVs' main drawback of limited range. The Tesla Model S can go about 300 miles (480 kilometers) on a single charge, although that varies depending on driving conditions, and that's quite a distance for an EV.

Other models run out of juice quicker, at about half that, because the longer the range, generally the heavier the batteries. And electric vehicles usually take hours to charge.

(AP Photo/Yuri Kageyama)

The Mirai can run for 312 miles (502 kilometers) per fueling, under U.S. EPA conditions, and fuels as quickly as a regular car.

Toyota's chairman, Takeshi Uchiyamada, believes hydrogen is an ideal, stable fuel for a future low-carbon society.

""In this light, hydrogen holds tremendous potential,"" Uchiyamada, known as ""the father of the Prius,"" the world's top-selling hybrid car, said during a tour of the factory.

""Hydrogen doesn't exist in the natural world on its own, but you can create hydrogen from various materials,"" he said.

The Prius turned out to be a good bet for Toyota. The Mirai could be the same. But not everyone shares Uchiyamada's enthusiasm for hydrogen.

A fuel cell mixes hydrogen with the oxygen in the air to generate electricity that can power a motor.

Producing the highly flammable gas and getting it into the vehicles requires energy. Ultimately, the idea is to convert energy from renewables like wind and solar power into hydrogen, or even make hydrogen from sewage waste.

Unlike a gas-powered internal combustion engine, the only byproducts from a fuel cell are electricity, heat and water. There are no emissions of pollutants that can cause global warming. Yet the energy unleashed is powerful: Hydrogen is the fuel that sends NASA rockets into space.

So fuel cells could be used to power cars, trains, buses, trucks and forklifts, and to provide electricity and heat for homes.

Detroit-based General Motors Co., Mercedes-Benz of Germany, Japan's Honda Motor Co. and Hyundai of South Korea have also developed fuel cell vehicles that are on the roads in extremely limited numbers.

The global stock of electric vehicles will soon surpass 2 million, according to the International Energy Agency. It's projected to climb to between 9 million-20 million by 2020. Fuel cell vehicles are scarcely a presence.

The Hydrogen Council, made up of 28 companies that are promoting hydrogen fuel, said in a report this week that it expects hydrogen to power about 10 to 15 million cars and 500,000 trucks by 2030. It also forecasts it will be widely used for industries, heating and power and power storage.

The group met this week in Bonn, on the sidelines of the COP23 U.N. meeting on the environment.

Toyota and other manufacturers pursuing hydrogen fuel cells face some significant hurdles. Japan has an ample 28,000 EV charging stations but only 92 hydrogen fueling stations, and they are costly to build.

Hydrogen is viewed as potentially hazardous: the 1937 Hindenberg disaster, when 36 people died when the hydrogen-fueled airship caught fire and crashed, ended an earlier era of hydrogen-powered passenger travel.

Hydrogen explosions during the 2011 nuclear catastrophe in Fukushima are a more recent example of such hazards. But proponents of the fuel say hydrogen is no more dangerous than gas or electricity if handled properly.

A fill-up with hydrogen takes about as long as at a gas pump, while EV charging takes about 30 minutes using special equipment for quick charging. Regular charging can take hours.

""I'm not claiming that hydrogen will replace any form of energy, but it will find its place in the world energy mix,"" Benoit Potier, chief executive of French industrial gas company Air Liquide, and a chair of the Hydrogen Council, said in a telephone interview.

Air Liquide has been working on producing, storing and distributing hydrogen fuel for more than four decades. Potier says he expects costs for making the gas will fall as its use becomes more widespread.

In one step toward widening use of hydrogen, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, an aerospace, motorcycle and ship manufacturer, is developing a technology to make hydrogen in Australia using ""brown coal,"" peat or low-grade coal for shipment to Japan in tankers it plans to make.

Not all Japanese automakers are sold on the idea. Manabu Satou, general manager of technology at Toyota's rival Nissan Motor Co., finds it an ""utter mystery"" why anyone would be so set on fuel cells when China, the world's biggest car market, is going for conventional EVs.

""If we are talking about a form of great energy like hydrogen, then why not just go all the way to a nuclear car?"" said Satou, whose company leads in EV sales with its popular Leaf compact.

Ryuichi Kino, who has written about electric vehicles and energy, views fuel cell vehicles as an excessively expensive, futuristic technology.

""If it focuses too much on fuel cells, Japan is going to end up super-ultra-Galapagos,"" he said, alluding to the secluded Pacific islands that are home to unique species that don't exist elsewhere.

(AP Photo/Yuri Kageyama)

For most automakers, fuel cells are an area just for research, while EVs already are commercialized, Kino said.

But he allows that a technological breakthrough could bring a hydrogen-based sea change in the global race toward automotive ""electrification.""

""Winners could become losers, and losers could become winners. It's still anyone's game,"" Kino said.

Study Predicts 400 Million Cars Will be Hydrogen-Powered By 2050 - MotorTrend,"Tue, 14 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vdG9ydHJlbmQuY29tL25ld3Mvc3R1ZHktcHJlZGljdHMtNDAwLW1pbGxpb24tY2Fycy13aWxsLWJlLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLXBvd2VyZWQtYnktMjA1MC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thanks to a limited fueling infrastructure and other factors, hydrogen cars are still few and far between. But the Hydrogen Council has an optimistic view for the long-term, saying there could be around 10 to 15 million hydrogen-powered cars and 500,000 trucks by 2030. By 2050, that number could grow to 400 million hydrogen cars and 15 to 20 million trucks.

The Hydrogen Council consists of 18 core members from multiple industries. Audi, BMW, Daimler, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, and Toyota are among the automakers participating in the initiative, joining other companies such as specialty gas supplier Air Liquide and Royal Dutch Shell. The Council created a study that quantifies hydrogen's role in the energy sector of the future.

Across multiple industries, not just transportation, hydrogen has the potential to account for almost one-fifth of total final energy consumed by 2050, the study found. At this level, hydrogen could contribute 20 percent toward global climate targets. In the Paris Agreement, world leaders agreed to limit global temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

The study suggests that EVs can't do it all. To achieve the climate goals, the study says there would need to be 80 million zero-emission and 80 million plug-in hybrid electric vehicles on the road by 2030. ""To bet on a single technology to solve the decarbonization challenge in transportation is not only likely to fall short of the required emission reductions, it is also risky if the hoped-for advances in that single technology-or the speed at which production lines and supply chains are developed-do not materialize,"" the study says.

Last year, IHS Automotive released a study predicting hydrogen vehicles will still be quite uncommon in about decade's time. By 2027, this study says, hydrogen cars are expected to make up less than 0.1 percent of the global vehicle market share. That means automakers would sell an average of just around 70,000 hydrogen cars a year.

Reduced costs should help lure more people to hydrogen fuel cells, the study contends. Building the necessary fueling infrastructure will cost $1,500 to $2,000 per hydrogen car, but after 2030, the cost could drop to less than $1,000. When it comes to total cost of ownership, the cost disadvantage held by an FCEV over an internal combustion vehicle could drop below 10 percent for many passenger cars between 2025 and 2030. This reduction will come as a result of increased manufacturing and a stronger fueling infrastructure.

"The ELA-3 launch complex in Kourou, French Guiana - RussianSpaceWeb.com","Wed, 29 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJ1c3NpYW5zcGFjZXdlYi5jb20va291cm91X2VsYTMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The ELA-3 launch facility for the Ariane-5 rocket in Korou During the 1990s, the European Space Agency, ESA, funded the most extensive construction to date in Kourou. With a price tag of 800 million ECU, the ELA-3 launch complex was intended specifically for the Ariane-5 rocket. The heavy-lifting vehicle was meant to eventually replace all previous-generation Ariane rockets. The ELA-3 launch complex Spread over 15 square kilometers (three by five kilometers), the ELA-3 complex was located immediately east of its predecessor -- the ELA-2 facility -- and some 25 kilometers northwest of Kourou. The launch complex could fire between eight and 10 Ariane-5 rockets per year at one-month minimum intervals. After an initial trial and error period, the launch teams were expected to conduct routine launch campaigns lasting around 22 work days. Unlike the old Ariane launch facilities, the ELA-3 launch pad would have no movable service tower. The rocket would be delivered to the pad in vertical position on a movable platform, along with an umbilical mast. Normally, this would be done two days before launch, but theoretically could be performed as late as a few hours before launch. The developers believed that such a design would enable the launch complex to accommodate the maximum number of missions and also minimize damage to the infrastructure in case the mighty rocket exploded right on its launch pad. ELA-3 consists of two zones:

THE LAUNCHER PREPARATION ZONE, which in its turn consists of the following main elements: The launch control center Located in a 2,700-square-meter protected enclosure, which is designed to withstand the impact of falling launcher elements. It features two independent launcher checkout rooms. The launcher integration building A 58-meter-high building with an 80,000 cubical meters air-conditioned interior, where solid-propellant boosters, main, upper stages and vehicle equipment bay of the Ariane-5 rocket are all assembled on a mobile launch table. Assembly, electrical and tightness checks are performed here in a 13-day cycle, before roll-out to the final assembly building. The final assembly building A 90-meter high building with a 123,000 cubic meters of air-conditioned interior where payloads are mated with their flight adapters, encapsulated inside the fairing and hoisted onto the launcher. Assembly of the launcher's upper section, associated electrical checks and filling of the upper-stage with propellants is also carried out here in a eight-day cycle before the launcher is finally rolled out to the launch zone some hours prior to lift-off. The Ariane-5 rocket with the ATV spacecraft is being prepared for the rollout from the final assembly building to the launch pad at the ELA-3 launch complex in Kourou, French Guiana, on March 7, 2008. Copyright © 2008 Anatoly Zak THE LAUNCH ZONE Final countdown and lift-off of the Ariane-5 takes place in the launch zone which includes: A solid base interfacing with the launch table, and including the cryogenic propellant (liquid oxygen/hydrogen) feed lines and launcher checkout umbilical connections. It also has a wind dampening shield and four lightning-conductor towers;

Three separate flame trenches (one for the Vulcan engine and one for each booster);

A 90-meter-high water tower with a storage capacity of 1,500 cubic meters for table cooling and noise dampening at lift-off;

Connection facilities for the mobile cryogenic storage tanks;

A 310-square-meter gaseous hydrogen burn-off pool; The launcher preparation zone and the launch pad are connected by a four-kilometer dual rail line. The rocket is transferred to the launch pad on a mobile launch table equipped with a 58-meter-tall umbilical mast. A second table was to be delivered in 1998. Each launch table weighs 870 tons unfueled. It supports the launcher during the entire preparation campaign. Combined, the launch table and the rocket reach the mass of 1,500 tons. They are towed by truck from the final assembly building to the launch zone. During the transfer, power, ventilation and air-conditioning are provided by a special servicing unit, while a damper is used to absorb the energy generated by the action of the wind on the launcher. Ariane support area Along with the ELA-3 launch complex itself, a number of other Ariane-5-dedicated production and test facilities was built at the Guiana Space Center. As with the main launch complex, ESA eventually transferred this infrastructure to industrial operators: The Guiana propellant plan t, for mixing and casting the large solid-propellant booster segments. This facility was handed over to Regulus, a joint subsidiary of Fiat Avio (Italy) and SNPE (France) in 1990.

The liquid hydrogen plant, built and operated by Air Liquide (France). Construction of the complex Given the rich heritage of rocket development in France, ESA delegated all development work on launch facilities and the rocket itself to the French space agency, CNES. The construction of the ELA-3 facility started in 1988. The project involved 60 European companies and required some two million man-hours for all the work in the fields of engineering design, construction and testing of infrastructure, power-supply , air-conditioning systems, mechanical structures, specialized tooling, ground-to-launcher connections, cryogenic and conventional fluids, computerized checkout systems, inspection and so on. Once the Ariane-5 ""learned to fly,"" by the end of the 1990s, responsibility for ELA-3 operations, including launcher integration and launch operations, final payload preparation, management and maintenance of facilities, insurance, safety and quality control were gradually transferred from ESA to Arianespace. However, even after Arianespace had completely taken over the operations, it employed mostly same contractors from countries-members of ESA. Total 12 firms from Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and Spain assigned around 250 people to support the program. In the meantime, CNES remained in Kourou, providing coordination for overall operations at the launch site, ensuring ground and inflight safety, and manning tracking and telemetry stations, and meteorological and telecommunications facilities. The agency also provided operations and maintenance for payload processing and logistical facilities. Between 1994 and 1996, ESA started using the completed facilities of the ELA-3 complex for a series of main stage firing tests. The first two Ariane-5 test launches, known as Flight 501 and 502 found few problems with the ELA-3 ground infrastructure, even though the same could not be said about the rocket. The first launch of Ariane-5 in 1996 ended in the explosion and crash of the rocket on the shore of the Atlantic Ocean within Guiana Space Center. On 25 November 1997, Fredrick Engström, ESA Director of Launchers, Michel Courtois, Deputy Director-General of CNES and Jean-Marie Luton, Chairman of Arianespace, signed the document formally handing over the ELA-3 complex from ESA to Arianespace.

Toyota Also Betting on Hydrogen-Powered Vehicles - The Car Guide - The Car Guide,"Thu, 23 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vbW9iaWxlLmd1aWRlYXV0b3dlYi5jb20vZW4vYXJ0aWNsZXMvNDQ2NzIvdG95b3RhLWFsc28tYmV0dGluZy1vbi1oeWRyb2dlbi1wb3dlcmVkLXZlaGljbGVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Manufacturers can’t predict the future, but they all seem to agree that one technology alone won’t replace the internal combustion engine. During our visit to the Tokyo Auto Show, Didier Leroy, Executive Vice-President at Toyota, echoed that very sentiment.

He believes that by 2050, significantly fewer cars will run purely on gasoline. Hybrids and plug-in hybrids will enjoy large shares of the market thanks to their versatility, while battery-powered electric models will be more numerous, particularly in urban areas.

Toyota, like Honda and several other manufacturers, also finds the hydrogen powertrain an interesting option for vehicles that could otherwise be difficult to electrify. Buyers will have a range of choices and their needs will determine the technology that suits them best. Toyota has been working on hydrogen drivetrains since 1992, long before the advent of the Prius.

A vehicle that uses a hydrogen battery is an electric vehicle

Some of you may be wondering just what a hydrogen vehicle is. No, it is not equipped with an engine that burns hydrogen instead of gasoline. In fact, it’s 100% electric, but instead of storing electricity in a battery pack, it is produced by way of a hydrogen chemical reaction in a fuel cell.

It generates an electric current to supply the electric motor, and the hydrogen contained in a reservoir can be refilled in a matter of minutes. Incidentally, this type of vehicle is noticeably lighter than a traditional electric vehicle equipped with a battery pack. Less weight gives you greater range.

In theory, hydrogen vehicles are a very interesting solution. You get a car that is fully electric, produces no emissions and can recover its autonomy in a matter of a few minutes—the time it takes to fill up the tank. But it’s not perfect.

The disadvantages

The big challenge of hydrogen is the distribution network. Have you seen many hydrogen service stations? Probably not. This infrastructure has yet to be developed. We can expect it to hit major urban centres first and to require industry intervention in certain countries. Air Liquide already produces the hydrogen for stations in the northern United States and other companies are also trying to penetrate the market.

Hydrogen’s main detractors point out that large amounts of electricity are required to produce it and that, in many cases, it is made using fossil fuels. To be truly beneficial, hydrogen would have to be made from cleaner sources, like hydroelectricity, wind or solar energy. Consider that, every night, Hydro-Québec generates surpluses that are simply wasted. Why not use these surpluses to produce hydrogen and thus recover lost energy? That’s what a mini wind power station in Japan does, and we had the chance to visit it during our time in the area.

It previously produced electricity with a 23% efficiency rate, but now that the wind power supplies a mini hydrogen power plant, when winds are insufficient, its rate of productivity rises to more than 50%. The hydrogen produced is then sent to various businesses in the port area that use electric fuel-cell forklifts that can’t be plugged in because they’re in constant use. It’s an excellent way to reduce these companies’ emissions.

The advantages

One of the main advantages is practicality. No need to wait for hours for your vehicle to recharge—a fill up of a few minutes will give you back full electric range. This will come in handy when you’re far from a big city or you don’t have access to a charger.

You also get better range because it can store more energy, which is a bonus for those who have a long daily commute. Toyota introduced the Fine-Comfort Ride concept at the Tokyo Auto Show. This vehicle boasts 1000 km of range, thank you very much.

But Toyota isn’t going to ditch the fully electric car just yet. The fuel cell option will complement classic electric vehicles and it promises to be particularly useful for powering models that are difficult to electrify otherwise. People don’t buy cars anymore—and that trend is now global. In North America, 64% of vehicles sold in 2016 were SUVs and pickups.

Because of their size and weight, big vehicles are harder to electrify using batteries. More than 125,000 Ford F-150s were sold last year in Canada. It would be unthinkable to electrify these mastodons and preserve their primary qualities at an affordable price. They use so much energy that their batteries would be heavier than their payload capacity. That’s why hydrogen fuel cells make much more sense for bigger vehicles. And making big vehicles emission-free also has a greater environmental impact than doing the same to smaller cars.

Not just for cars

The same technology can be applied to many types of recreational vehicles, such as leisure boats. Electrifying a pleasure craft makes a lot more sense with fuel cell technology than with a battery pack. On a nice day at the cottage, you want to actually use your boat, not leave it plugged in for hours to recharge the batteries. Ditto for transport: Toyota is preparing the Sora, a bus that uses this technology. It can accommodate 79 passengers and will be used, among other things, to transport visitors at the upcoming 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games.

Basically, hydrogen vehicles will add to the choices already offered, which will make it increasingly complicated to choose your ideal vehicle. Just wait until autonomous driving technology is added to the equation! You’ll need to read every article on The Car Guide to get your bearings."
Hyundai Kona | CUV Could Arrive Early - Ward's Auto,"Tue, 07 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhcmRzYXV0by5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvaHl1bmRhaS1rb25hLWNvdWxkLWFycml2ZS1lYXJsedIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LAS VEGAS – While it is officially slated to go on sale in first-quarter 2018 in the U.S., some Hyundai dealers may get Kona CUVs a bit earlier.

There’s a chance some units will arrive before Jan. 1, Mike O’Brien, vice president-product, digital and corporate planning for Hyundai Motor America, tells WardsAuto here during a media event for the Accent subcompact.

“I know production will start before the end of the year (for the U.S.),” O’Brien says of the automaker’s new small CUV, which has been on sale since June in Hyundai’s home market of Korea, where it is assembled.

Hyundai’s 2017 U.S. sales could use even the small infusion the Kona could bring to December numbers.

In the absence of a model in the hot subcompact-CUV group, as well as a decline in its bread-and-butter passenger-car sales, Hyundai’s U.S. volume is down 13.1% from like-2016, the biggest drop among automakers in the U.S. this year and ahead of FCA’s 8.5% loss.

Excluding Genesis luxury-marque sales, Hyundai brand volume has fallen 15.2% this year compared with year-ago, with certain model lines sharply dropping, such as the recently refreshed Sonata midsize sedan, down 32.3% from January-October 2016.

In July, O’Brien told WardsAuto Hyundai was cutting back on fleet sales to daily-rental companies due to disagreements with the firms over pricing.

He can’t say whether Hyundai made any sales to daily-rental fleets in October, but HMA notes in a release that total fleet sales fell 23% in the month vs. year-ago, impacting the 11.8% decline in Hyundai’s U.S. sales last month.

“We’re just deciding to stand aside for the time being,” O’Brien says here of daily-rental business, noting Hyundai’s commercial-fleet business still is strong.

While Hyundai said it had its best-ever CUV sales for the month of October this year, with the Tucson and Santa Fe models combining for 21,755 deliveries, the midsize Santa Fe is flat for the year, down 0.8% through October.

With the next-generation Santa Fe due within a year, O’Brien says the advanced age of the current model is having a negative impact, and he acknowledges some dimensional deficiencies for bigger-is-better American car buyers.

“Expect something more suitable for the U.S. market,” he says of the next-generation model.

While the current Santa Fe is available in 2- and 3-row configurations, Hyundai is expected to once again offer a 3-row CUV under a different name, as it did a decade ago when it sold the Veracruz model.

The Tucson, the No.1-selling model in WardsAuto’s Small CUV segment through October, is up 24.7% year-to-date to 91,570 units. Still, O’Brien notes HMA remains frustrated with not having enough supply of the vehicle from its Korean parent.

“We’re still fighting to get more production capacity for the U.S. market,” he says.

Hyundai currently is launching the plug-in-hybrid version of the Ioniq green car, available for order in all 50 states, and later this month the next-generation ’18 Accent subcompact sedan arrives at dealers.

The Accent also has been heavily affected by the drop in daily-rental sales, an HMA spokesman says. Accent sales are down 27.0% to 50,126 deliveries through October.

The next-gen Accent is expected to keep the model’s sales steady, and it remains a more affordable entry point for the brand than an A-segment CUV, which likely would need all-wheel drive, boosting an entry-level-model sticker price, O’Brien says.

“You can’t design two totally different platforms – one that’s just a 2-wheel-drive platform and another that’s an AWD platform,” he says. “So all automakers have one platform that supports AWD and all those components that are ancillary that you don’t see, like front hubs for example, (needing to be beefed up). So the front hub on an AWD car is much more expensive than a front hub on a 2-wheel-drive car, because it’s got to be made for the extra torque handling and so forth.”

Still, HMA has said it is studying an A-segment CUV for the U.S., something boxy and along the lines of sister-brand Kia’s B-segment Soul.

In addition to the Ioniq PHEV, Hyundai is keeping the green-vehicle pipeline flowing with a next-generation Tucson fuel-cell vehicle. Expected to be revealed to U.S. audiences in January at CES in Las Vegas, the model is set to be more widely available than the current Tucson FCV to match the expected increase in hydrogen refueling stations in the U.S.

California is projected to have roughly 40 stations open by year-end, but O’Brien believes the East Coast needs to come online for FCVs to take off as a viable alternative to internal-combustion-engine vehicles.

“That’s frankly a big opportunity for us, so we need to get there as soon as we can,” he says.

Air Liquide, with financial backing from Toyota, has plans to open a dozen stations in New England and the New York area in the next few years. A station in Providence, RI, already is open and another is slated to go live before year-end in Mansfield, MA.

While Hyundai sees fuel cells as the best propulsion choice for long-range driving, it does have a relatively long-range electric vehicle due in Korea next year in the form of the Kona.

O’Brien is mum when asked if the 242-mile (390-km) Kona EV is U.S.-bound, although he hints news is coming soon.

“We’re not ready to announce anything yet, but very soon you will hear. Very soon.”

Hyundai and Kia have slated 31 green cars to debut by 2020, although it’s unclear how many of those will be sold in the States.

"Hydrogen, scaling up - new roadmap launches at COP 23 - Hydrogen Council","Mon, 13 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vaHlkcm9nZW5jb3VuY2lsLmNvbS9lbi9oeWRyb2dlbi1zY2FsaW5nLXVwLW5ldy1yb2FkbWFwLWxhdW5jaGVzLWF0LWNvcC0yMy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As global leaders gathered at COP 23 in Bonn, 18 key leaders in their industry verticals, united in the Hydrogen Council coalition, came together to launch first ever globally quantified vision of the role of hydrogen, developed with support from McKinsey. In addition to being a key pillar in of the energy transition, the study shows that hydrogen has the potential to develop US $2.5tn of business, creating more than 30 million jobs by 2050.

Taking the Hydrogen Council’s vision for hydrogen to the next level, the study entitled Hydrogen, Scaling up outlines a comprehensive and quantified roadmap to scale deployment and its enabling impact on the energy transition.

Deployed at scale, hydrogen could account for almost one-fifth of total final energy consumed by 2050. This would reduce annual CO2 emissions by roughly 6 gigatons compared to today’s levels, and contribute roughly 20% of the abatement required to limit global warming to two degrees Celsius.

On the demand side, the Hydrogen Council sees the potential for hydrogen to power about 10 to 15 million cars and 500,000 trucks by 2030, with many uses in other sectors as well, such as industry processes and feedstocks, building heating and power, power generation and storage. Overall, the study predicts that the annual demand for hydrogen could increase tenfold by 2050 to almost 80 EJ in 2050 meeting 18% of total final energy demand in the 2050 two-degree scenario. At a time when global populations are expected to grow by two billion people by 2050, hydrogen technologies have the potential to create opportunities for sustainable economic growth.

“The world in the 21st century must transition to widespread low carbon energy use,” said Takeshi Uchiyamada, Chairman of Toyota Motor Corporation and co-chair of the Hydrogen Council. “Hydrogen is an indispensable resource to achieve this transition because it can be used to store and transport wind, solar and other renewable electricity to power transportation and many other things. The Hydrogen Council has identified seven roles for hydrogen, which is why we are encouraging governments and investors to give it a prominent role in their energy plans. The sooner we get the hydrogen economy going, the better, and we are all committed to making this a reality.”

Achieving such scale would require substantial investments; approximately US$20 to 25 billion annually for a total of about US$280 billion until 2030. Within the right regulatory framework – including long-term, stable coordination and incentive policies – the report considers that attracting these investments to scale the technology is feasible. The world already invests more than US$1.7 trillion in energy each year, including US$650 billion in oil and gas, US$300 billion in renewable electricity, and more than US$300 billion in the automotive industry.

“This study confirms the place of hydrogen as a central pillar in the energy transition, and encourages us in our support of its large-scale deployment. Hydrogen will be an unavoidable enabler for the energy transition in certain sectors and geographies. The sooner we make this happen the sooner we will be able to enjoy the needed benefits of Hydrogen at the service of our economies and our societies,” said Benoît Potier, Chairman and CEO, Air Liquide. “Solutions are technologically mature and industry players are committed. We need concerted stakeholder efforts to make this happen; leading this effort is the role of the Hydrogen Council.”

The launch of the new roadmap came during the Sustainability Innovation Forum in the presence of 18 senior members of the Hydrogen led by co-chairs Takeshi Uchiyamada, Chairman of Toyota and Benoît Potier, Chairman and CEO, Air Liquide and accompanied by Prof. Aldo Belloni, CEO of The Linde Group, Woong-chul Yang, Vice Chairman of Hyundai Motor Company and Anne Stevens, Board Member of Anglo American. During the launch, the Hydrogen Council called upon investors, policymakers, and businesses to join them in accelerating deployment of hydrogen solutions for the energy transition."
Yamaha looks to rev up scooter sales - BusinessLine,"Mon, 20 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1YnVzaW5lc3NsaW5lLmNvbS9jb21wYW5pZXMvWWFtYWhhLWxvb2tzLXRvLXJldi11cC1zY29vdGVyLXNhbGVzL2FydGljbGUyMDU2MTg0NC5lY2XSAWxodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdWJ1c2luZXNzbGluZS5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL1lhbWFoYS1sb29rcy10by1yZXYtdXAtc2Nvb3Rlci1zYWxlcy9hcnRpY2xlMjA1NjE4NDQuZWNlL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Of the 5 lakh two-wheelers Yamaha targets to sell this year (2013), it expects two lakh units to be scooters.

While the overall two-wheeler industry is growing at 10-11 per cent, the scooter segment is growing at over 20 per cent, said Roy Kurian, National Business Head, India Yamaha Motor. There is a huge potential for scooters in urban and semi-urban areas.

This trend is driven by more women looking to be more mobile, said Kurian. Families are also increasingly looking at vehicles which the entire family can use, he said.

Yamaha is targeting 1 million (10 lakh) units by 2015 and 40-45 per cent will come from scooters. It sold 3.44 lakh motorcycles last year.

Hero and Honda are the big players in the scooter segment. Yamaha entered the space in September with the Ray range; since then, it has sold over 35,000 units.

“Though it is targeted at the urban woman, Ray is also being used by boys and husbands.”

New manufacturing plant near chennai

Yamaha’s upcoming manufacturing plant at Vallam Vadagal, near Chennai, will start production in 2014 with scooters. The plant will have a production capacity of 1.8 million units, taking Yamaha’s total capacity to 2.8 million units. Yamaha already has two plants in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.

To encourage more women to take up scooter riding, Yamaha on Friday launched a rider training programme. The 3-hour training will be given to women free of cost at Yamaha dealerships by company staff. The company is also targeting colleges to offer training.

The programme covers aspects such as safety, balance, posture, start-stop, turning, cornering and braking.

This is also an attempt to get customers to experience the Yamaha brand. The company has similar rider training programmes worldwide, especially in Asean countries. About 70 per cent of people who undergo this training end up buying the Yamaha brand, said Kurian. Yamaha hopes to repeat this in India, too.

Over 400 million cars will be powered by hydrogen by 2050 - PakWheels,"Thu, 23 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBha3doZWVscy5jb20vYmxvZy80MDAtbWlsbGlvbi1jYXJzLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLTIwNTAv0gFCaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGFrd2hlZWxzLmNvbS9ibG9nLzQwMC1taWxsaW9uLWNhcnMtaHlkcm9nZW4tMjA1MC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Due to a number of factors – limited fueling infrastructure being the top one – we still don’t see a lot of hydrogen-powered cars around us. The Hydrogen Council, however, is very confident about hydrogen as a fuel in the future. The council is confident that by 2030, 10-15 million hydrogen-powered cars will be on the road with about 500,000 trucks. The number of hydrogen-powered vehicles is predicted to grow to no less than 400 million with about 15-20 million trucks by 2050.

The council comprises of 18 core members belonging to different industries. The core members related to the automobile industry include Audi, Daimler, Hyundai, BMW, and more. The automakers are seconding the initiative by teaming up with specialty gas companies including Air Liquide and Royal Dutch Shell. The Hydrogen Council initiated a study that would be able to quantify the need of hydrogen as a fuel in the future and would predict the proportion in which the hydrogen-powered automobiles and others will be divided in the future.

According to the study, hydrogen will account for one-fifth of the total energy generated by 2050. This fuel consumption will be spread across multiple industries instead of just transportation. At this stage, hydrogen would be able to contribute 20 percent towards the global climate target. The world leaders shook hand on limiting the global temperature increases to 2-degree Celsius above pre-industrial level in the Paris agreement.

Currently, many believe that electric vehicles will be the answer to all of it, the study in question says otherwise. The study says that there will need to be 80 million zero-emission and 80 million electric vehicles by 2030. The study explains that relying on a single technology to handle the decarbonization targets in the transportation sector has a very little chance of success."
"Waga Energy et Air Liquide, une scission fondatrice - Les Echos","Wed, 15 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL2VudHJlcHJlbmV1cnMubGVzZWNob3MuZnIvY3JlYXRpb24tZW50cmVwcmlzZS9yZXNlYXV4LWFjY29tcGFnbmVtZW50L3dhZ2EtZW5lcmd5LWV0LWFpci1saXF1aWRlLXVuZS1zY2lzc2lvbi1mb25kYXRyaWNlLTE5ODk2NzXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Le 14 février 2017, la start-up Waga Energy a injecté, dans le réseau urbain, du biométhane récupéré et distillé à partir de la décomposition de déchets ménagers.

Cette prouesse, qui a demandé plus de 10 ans de recherches, prend ses racines dans les bureaux d'études d'Air Liquide. A partir de 2003, Mathieu Lefebvre, Nicolas Paget et Benoit Lemaignan y travaillent sur la valorisation des gaz émis par les décharges ménagères.

Mais en 2013 le groupe décide de mettre en veille ces études, pas en ligne avec la stratégie globale : « On se devait pourtant de mener ce projet à bien, pour nos enfants et pour nous, affirme Mathieu Lefebvre. Le moteur de la création de Waga, c'est l'indignation devant le gaspillage et la pollution. »

Les trois compagnons quittent alors Air Liquide et, rejoints par Guénaël Prince, ils fondent Waga Energy (pour Waste and gas energy, l'énergie des déchets et du gaz).

Publicité

Un premier contrat clé

Malgré la scission, le groupe centenaire ne perd pas de vue la jeune pousse. Air Liquide espère bénéficier d'une nouvelle technologie stratégique qu'il n'a pas souhaité développer en interne. La grande entreprise apporte un soutien financier en montant au capital, mais en restant à moins de 10 % pour laisser de l'autonomie.

Jamais le groupe n'étouffe la start-up. Les deux signent aussi un partenariat commercial dès le début. « Air Liquide, leader mondial dans l'ingénierie des gaz, cautionnait et encourageait notre démarche, se rappelle Mathieu Lefebvre. Ils nous ont amené une crédibilité énorme vis-à-vis des clients, des banques, des autorités. » La start-up parvient à mobiliser 10 millions d'euros sans chiffre d'affaires.

« Le même vocabulaire »

La culture d'entreprise d'Air Liquide a beaucoup joué. Des ingénieurs du groupe à la retraite conseillent la start-up sur des problématiques techniques, commerciales, contractuelles. « Avec eux, on se comprend tout de suite, se réjouit Mathieu Lefebvre. On a tous Air Liquide dans nos tripes. On utilise le même vocabulaire, la même sémantique, depuis des années. »

Aujourd'hui, Waga Energy exploite deux unités de production de biométhane, les Wagabox, en attendant la troisième en construction, et, sans doute, beaucoup d'autres. Dans le monde, les gaz de décharges s'échappent dans l'atmosphère, ou sont au mieux brûlés, à raison de 10 millions de mètres cubes par heure, soit environ la consommation gazière annuelle de la France, gaspillée."

‘‘ Le mécénat n’est pas uniquement réservé aux grands groupes ’’



Interview d'Eric PETERS, PDG de SOLUTYS Group

Réalisée le 10/11/2017 par Frédéric LEGRAS, Directeur du Portail FAQ Logistique

La Fondation SOLUTYS Group a pour vocation première de favoriser l’Acquisition et la Transmission des connaissances. Son Président, Monsieur Eric PETERS nous en présente l'action concrète.

Comment est née l’idée chez Solutys Group de créer une telle fondation ?

Plusieurs raisons ont conduit à la création de cette Fondation. La plus importante d’entre elles : les hommes et les femmes de l’entreprise. Grâce à l’engagement de chacun, SOLUTYS Group s’investit dans une démarche solidaire démontrant que le mécénat n’est pas uniquement réservé aux grands groupes, mais bien la traduction d’une volonté accessible aux PME responsables.

Au-delà des actions déjà menées par l’entreprise dans le cadre de son engagement RSE, je souhaite à travers la Fondation SOLUTYS Group, créée sous égide de la Fondation de France pour une durée minimale de 5 ans, démontrer qu'une PME peut, si elle en fait un objectif central de son développement, contribuer comme les grands groupes, au soutien de causes d'intérêt général.

Quelles sont les missions de la Fondation Solutys Group ? Ses actions concrètes ?

La Fondation SOLUTYS Group a pour vocation de favoriser l’acquisition et la transmission des connaissances. Elle soutient, à la mesure de ses moyens, des projets qui permettent à court, moyen et long terme d’œuvrer pour développer le savoir et aider ceux qui n’y ont pas accès. Le mécénat de la Fondation SOLUTYS Group se traduit par deux programmes d’action majeurs axés vers le patrimoine et l’éducation.

En accord avec ses valeurs, la Fondation SOLUTYS a décidé de s’engager aux côtés du Centre des monuments nationaux afin de favoriser l’accès au patrimoine culturel et historique au sein de toutes les régions. A ce titre, la Fondation SOLUTYS soutient donc une exposition patrimoniale d’envergure, « Marie Curie, une femme au Panthéon » qui se tient à Paris du 8 novembre 2017 au 4 mars 2018.

L’accès à l’école dans certaines régions du monde reste, dans un 21ème siècle pourtant hautement technologique, l’un des freins principaux à l’égalité des chances. Ceci a conduit la Fondation SOLUTYS à soutenir l’action menée par l’association « Cycles et Solidarité », au demeurant fondée par l’un des collaborateurs de SOLUTYS Group.

Quel est le métier de Solutys Group ? Existe-t-il un lien avec la mission de cette Fondation ?

La Fondation SOLUTYS Group s’est donnée pour mission, depuis sa création en 2013, de favoriser l’acquisition et la transmission des connaissances. En résonance avec les métiers de Solutys Group, qui portent sur l'acquisition et la transmission de données dans l’univers ‘’AIDC’’ – Automatic Identification & Data Capture, les projets portés par la Fondation SOLUTYS Group contribuent à la démocratisation des ""savoirs"" sous toutes leurs formes.

À propos de SOLUTYS Group



Spécialiste de l’intégration de solutions d’identification automatique, de traçabilité et de mobilité professionnelle par codes-barres et Rfid, SOLUTYS Group propose une offre globale de produits et services en adéquation avec les besoins d’une clientèle de grandes entreprises nationales, internationales ou de PME-PMI. SOLUTYS Group, qui a connu une forte croissance depuis sa création pour atteindre en 2016 un CA de 18 millions d’€, compte 75 collaborateurs et figure parmi les 3 principaux intégrateurs du marché de l’identification automatique grâce à ses filiales spécialisées. Les projets adressés par ses équipes vont en moyenne de 500€ pour l’activité e-business à plusieurs millions d’euros pour les grands comptes de SOLUTYS Technologies (Air Liquide, Alstom, Monoprix, Castorama, AP-HP, XPO, Geodis, Galeries Lafayette etc.).



Les PME sont également au cœur de la stratégie d’entreprise, spécifiquement accompagnées en proximité par les 6 Directions Régionales du Group à Paris, Strasbourg, Toulouse, Nantes, Rennes (ATscan) et Grenoble (Karelis).

À propos de la Fondation de France



Depuis 1969, la Fondation de France soutient des projets concrets et innovants qui répondent aux besoins des personnes face aux problèmes posés par l’évolution rapide de la société. Elle agit dans quatre domaines : l’aide aux personnes vulnérables, le développement de la connaissance, l’environnement et le développement de la philanthropie. Elle aide les donateurs à choisir les meilleurs projets, conseille les fondateurs sur leur champ d’intervention et sur le cadre juridique et fiscal le plus approprié. En 2016, elle a accompagné 828 fonds et fondations créés sous son égide, et consacré 174 millions d’euros à la sélection, la distribution et le suivi de 9300 subventions, prix et bourses. Indépendante et privée, la Fondation de France ne reçoit aucune subvention et ne peut agir que grâce à la générosité des donateurs."

Connue pour ses machines de tri disposées dans les grandes surfaces, la start-up parisienne, qui travaille avec de grands groupes du CAC 40, veut devenir un acteur incontournable du recyclage. Entretien avec le confondateur et président de Lemon Tri, Augustin Jaclin.

Que propose Lemon Tri ?

Un service de collecte et de mise au recyclage à destination des marchés hors domicile (entreprise, campus, gares, aéroports, centres commerciaux). On récupère et on envoie au recyclage tout ce qui est consommé en dehors de la maison.

En quoi vos machines permettent-elles de créer de la valeur ?

Nos machines intelligentes reconnaissent les emballages, les trient, les compactent et récompensent l’utilisateur pour son geste (bons d’achat, jeton pour un café, don à une association). On améliore le tri à la source, on supprime les erreurs, ce qui améliore toute la chaîne. On améliore la captation du déchet en jouant sur la dimension incitative des machines.

Quelle est la place de l’innovation dans votre solution ?

Elle est de deux ordres. Au niveau technique : nos outils sont des concentrés de technologie. Au niveau du service : nous récupérerons l’intégralité des déchets d’une entreprise avec une traçabilité impeccable.

A qui s’adresse vos machines ?

Nous adressons deux marchés : la grande distribution (Carrefour, Intermarché, Système U, Auchan…), en installant des bornes de collecte pour les bouteilles en plastique ; les entreprises, de la PME jusqu’au groupe du CAC 40 (Danone, Air Liquide, Axa, Sodexo…), qui veulent recycler plus et mieux.

Quel est votre modèle économique ?

Nous sommes un prestataire de services (collecte, location de machines, de bacs…) et nous revendons la matière que nous avons valorisée. Cette matière est ensuite transformée par des partenaires. Notre métier étant très capitalistique, nous n’excluons pas de lever à nouveau des fonds (1,3 M€ en 2016, Ndlr).

Où en sera Lemon Tri dans 4-5 ans ?

Nous voulons être l’interlocuteur unique pour ce qui concerne le recyclage et son amélioration. Lemon Tri a une croissance organique importante : on double de taille chaque année. L’objectif est de maintenir cette croissance à deux chiffres et de faire grossir nos plateformes pour imposer notre double modèle : des outils à forte valeur ajoutée couplés à une dimension sociale avec des emplois d’insertion via notre entreprise sociale, Lemon Aide."
GSE : « La logistique reste notre plus grand marché » - voxlog.fr,"Thu, 23 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveGxvZy5mci9hY3R1YWxpdGUvMjUxMi9nc2UtbGEtbG9naXN0aXF1ZS1yZXN0ZS1ub3RyZS1wbHVzLWdyYW5kLW1hcmNoZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Industrie, secteur tertiaire, PME, centres commerciaux : les activités de GSE sont multiples et se déclinent dans une dizaine de pays (dont la France avec 12 agences implantées sur tout le territoire, ainsi qu'en Chine) pour un chiffre d’affaires de près de 500 millions d’euros. Mais au milieu de cette multiplicité de projets, la supply chain est toujours le domaine de prédilection du groupe français créé en 1976, représentant de 60 à 70 % de son activité selon les pays. « La logistique reste notre plus grand marché. Sa force, c’est d’être en perpétuel renouvellement. Depuis deux ans maintenant, la montée du e-commerce a totalement redynamisé le secteur. Face aux demandes de plus en plus fortes de la part des consommateurs, la logistique est devenue un axe stratégique de développement pour les entreprises, et en particulier les pure players », détaille Roland Paul, CEO de GSE, évoquant le géant Amazon pour lequel le groupe a livré en 2013 un entrepôt de plus de 90 000 m² à Lauwin-Planque (59). Un vent d’air frais sur le secteur qui profite à GSE : « Les carnets de commandes sont pleins, même si les marges restent serrées. »

Des sites massifs

Avec ses 350 collaborateurs, GSE propose son expertise autant en termes de conception que de construction des bâtiments, y associant également des services fonciers tout au long des projets. « C’est un avantage pour nos clients qui peuvent ainsi bénéficier d’un interlocuteur unique », explique Roland Paul. En 2016, 70 opérations ont été réalisées, en France et à l'international, par le groupe. Un chiffre qui devrait rester stable sur la période 2017. De nombreux bâtiments ont ainsi été annoncés au fil de l’année. En France, on peut ainsi noter la plateforme Biocoop à Noves (13) en collaboration avec Barjane (« un de nos partenaires historiques »), un nouveau site de 60 000 m² pour la Scaso, centrale d'achats régionale des magasins E.Leclerc du Sud-Ouest, ainsi que le monumental chantier d'Artenay-Poupry (28) pour le compte de Carrefour : une plateforme d’une surface XXL de plus de 131 000 m². « C’est la grande tendance de ces dernières années : nous allons vers une massification des sites pour permettre une logistique unifiée. Du côté des distributeurs par exemple, on constate une demande pour des entrepôts plus grands qui réunissent le sec et le frais - cela a été le cas avec notre partenaire Intermarché par exemple ou encore avec la Scaso de E.Leclerc. Côté construction, de nouveaux formats se multiplient : certains sites en Europe peuvent ainsi atteindre des tailles de 40 mètres de haut afin de permettre du stockage automatisé vertical. Cela est plus rare en France, car les PLU y sont plus contraignants », détaille Roland Paul.

La diversité des réalisations est importante au sein de GSE, allant de petits bâtiments de 2 millions d’euros jusqu’à des grands sites pouvant dépasser les 60 millions d'euros. Parmi ces derniers, un centre de tri pour le compte de DHL, véritable « usine à colis » située à l’aéroport d’East Midlands en Angleterre et qui a ouvert ses portes cette année. « Nous avons une expertise forte dans les bâtiments logistiques automatisés. À partir de nos premiers contacts avec DHL, nous avons mis moins de six mois avant le début des travaux », raconte Roland Paul. La technologie BIM, adoptée par le groupe depuis maintenant plusieurs années, porte également ses fruits, permettant une amélioration de la vitesse de construction. Le groupe réfléchit d'ailleurs à des utilisations de la cette technologie pour des solutions de gestion de l'exploitation des batiments après construction. La question du développement durable est également un aspect important pour le groupe puisque 80 % de ses grands projets bénéficient désormais de certifications HQE ou Breeam."
"Véhicules électriques à hydrogène, avantages et inconvénients - The Car Guide","Mon, 06 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vbW9iaWxlLmd1aWRlYXV0b3dlYi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvNDQ1OTAvdmVoaWN1bGVzLWVsZWN0cmlxdWVzLWEtaHlkcm9nZW5lLWF2YW50YWdlcy1ldC1pbmNvbnZlbmllbnRzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Pas facile pour les constructeurs de prédire le futur, mais pratiquement tous s’entendent pour dire qu’une seule technologie ne remplacera pas le moteur à combustion. C’est ce que nous a affirmé, lors de notre visite au Salon de l’auto de Tokyo, Didier Leroy, vice-président à la direction chez Toyota.

Selon lui, d’ici 2050, de moins en moins de déplacements seront faits à bord de modèles purement à essence. Les hybrides et les hybrides rechargeables conserveront de bonnes parts de marché en raison de leur grande polyvalence et les modèles électriques à batteries seront aussi plus nombreux à être de la partie, surtout dans les centres urbains.

Toyota, tout comme Honda et plusieurs autres constructeurs, croit également que la pile à hydrogène est une solution intéressante pour électrifier plusieurs types de véhicules qui pourraient l’être difficilement autrement. Les acheteurs auront ainsi un éventail de choix et leurs besoins dicteront la technologie qui leur convient le mieux. Toyota travaille d’ailleurs sur les motorisations à hydrogène depuis 1992, soit bien avant l’arrivée de la Prius.

Un véhicule utilisant une pile à hydrogène, c’est un véhicule électrique

Plusieurs se demandent ce qu’est un véhicule à hydrogène. Non, il n’est pas équipé d’un moteur qui brûle de l’hydrogène au lieu de l’essence. C’est en fait un véhicule 100% électrique, mais au lieu que l’électricité soit emmagasinée dans un ensemble de batteries, elle est produite à partir d’une réaction chimique de l’hydrogène dans une pile à combustible.

Le courant électrique ainsi généré alimente le moteur électrique, alors que l’hydrogène est contenu dans un réservoir peut être rempli en l’espace de quelques minutes. Au passage, on obtient une économie de poids appréciable par rapport à un modèle électrique traditionnel. Moins de poids, plus d’autonomie!

En théorie, la solution est très intéressante. Vous disposez d’un véhicule 100% électrique et zéro émission, dont l’autonomie peut être récupérée en quelques minutes, le temps d’un plein. Toutefois, elle n’est pas parfaite.

Les désavantages

Tout d’abord, le grand défi de l’hydrogène, c’est le réseau de distribution. Avez-vous croisé beaucoup de stations-service d’hydrogène? Sûrement pas, car tout est à faire à ce chapitre, et le développement se fera par les grands centres et par le biais de l’industrie dans certains pays. Air Liquide produit déjà l’hydrogène des stations du nord des États-Unis et d’autres entreprises tentent aussi de percer le marché.

Les principaux détracteurs de l’hydrogène soulignent qu’il faut une plus grande quantité d’électricité pour le produire et que dans bien des cas, il sera produit à partir de sources polluantes. Le succès est bien entendu de produire l’hydrogène à partir de sources plus propres, dont l’hydroélectricité, l’éolien ou le solaire. D’ailleurs, chaque nuit, Hydro-Québec génère des surplus qui sont simplement gaspillés. Pourquoi ne pas utiliser ces surplus pour produire de l’hydrogène et ainsi récupérer une électricité qui est perdue? C’est ce que fait une minicentrale éolienne, située au Japon, que nous avons eu la chance de visiter lors de notre passage dans la région.

Son taux d’efficacité en production électrique était de 23%, mais en alimentant une minicentrale d’hydrogène, lorsque les vents ne sont pas suffisants, on a fait passer son taux de productivité à plus de 50%. L’hydrogène ainsi produit est envoyé dans les différentes entreprises du port qui utilisent des chariots élévateurs électriques à pile à combustible, de l’équipement qui doit rouler constamment et que l’on ne peut laisser brancher au mur durant des heures. Une excellente manière de réduire les émissions de ces entreprises.

Les avantages

L’un des principaux avantages, c’est l’aspect pratique. Pas besoin d’attendre des heures pour la recharge de votre véhicule, un plein de quelques minutes vous redonnera une autonomie électrique complète, une chose appréciable lorsque vous êtes éloigné des grands centres ou que vous n’avez pas accès à un dispositif de recharge.

L’autonomie est aussi supérieure puisqu’il possible d’emmagasiner une charge énergétique plus importante, un élément intéressant pour ceux qui font plus de kilométrage quotidiennement. Toyota a présenté le Fine-Comfort Ride concept au Salon de Tokyo, un véhicule disposant d’une autonomie de 1 000 km, rien de moins.

Pas question de laisser de côté le 100% électrique chez Toyota. La pile à combustible sera complémentaire aux VÉ classiques et permettra surtout d’électrifier des modèles qui le seraient difficilement autrement. Les gens ne s’achètent plus de voitures et la tendance est maintenant mondiale. En Amérique du Nord, 64% des véhicules vendus en 2016 étaient des VUS et des camionnettes.

En raison de leur gabarit et de leur poids, ils sont plus compliqués à électrifier à partir de batteries. Il s’est vendu plus de 125 000 Ford F-150 au pays l’an passé et il est impensable d’électrifier de tels mastodontes en conservant leur attrait et surtout, un prix concurrentiel. Leur consommation énergétique est telle que le poids des batteries serait supérieur à leur capacité de chargement. Vu son aspect pratique, la pile à hydrogène s’avère une excellente solution afin d’électrifier des véhicules plus imposants et qui requièrent une grande quantité d’énergie. L’impact sur la réduction des émissions sera ainsi beaucoup plus important que dans le cas d’une petite voiture.

Pas juste pour les voitures

C’est le même constat pour plusieurs types de véhicules de loisir, notamment la marine récréative. Électrifier une embarcation de plaisance a beaucoup plus de sens avec une technologie de pile à combustible que via un ensemble de batteries. Par une belle journée d’été au chalet, on veut profiter de son embarcation, et non pas la laisser branchée durant des heures pour en recharger les batteries. Même constat pour le transport, Toyota s’apprête d’ailleurs à commercialiser un nouvel autobus utilisant cette technologie. Le Sora peut accueillir 79 passagers et servira entre autres les visiteurs des prochains Jeux olympiques de Tokyo de 2020.

Bref, les véhicules à hydrogène étofferont les choix déjà offerts. Il sera donc de plus en plus compliqué de choisir votre véhicule idéal... Attendez que l’on ajoute les technologies de conduite autonome à tout ça, il faudra un Guide de l’auto de 1 200 pages pour vous y retrouver!"
Les transports à hydrogène frémissent en France | Connaissances des énergies - Connaissance des Énergies,"Mon, 13 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbm5haXNzYW5jZWRlc2VuZXJnaWVzLm9yZy9hZnAvbGVzLXRyYW5zcG9ydHMtaHlkcm9nZW5lLWZyZW1pc3NlbnQtZW4tZnJhbmNlLTE3MTExM9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Jusqu'ici reléguée au second plan derrière les véhicules électriques, la filière hydrogène française commence à se faire une place dans la mobilité propre, et les projets émergent: stations de recharges, ligne de bus, ou encore trains.

Le constructeur ferroviaire Alstom vient d'annoncer que 14 trains à pile à combustible, d'une autonomie de 1 000 kilomètres, viendraient remplacer, à partir de 2021, des trains diesel en Basse-Saxe (Allemagne). Une première mondiale, selon l'industriel français.

Outre ce contrat, ces derniers mois ont été prolifiques pour la filière: Pau a lancé le premier projet français de ligne de bus électriques, alimentés par de l'hydrogène, avec Engie (ex GDF-Suez) et le fabricant belge de bus Van Hool tandis que la région Rhône-Alpes veut déployer 20 stations de recharge et une flotte de 1 000 véhicules à hydrogène. Même l'automobile s'y met. ""Malgré certaines réticences des constructeurs français à s'engager"" dans cette voie, les équipementiers Faurecia et Plastic Omnium, travaillent notamment sur des réservoirs à hydrogène, note Philippe Boucly, vice-président de l'Association française pour l'hydrogène et les piles à combustible (Afhypac).

Utilisé dans les véhicules électriques équipés de piles à combustible, l'hydrogène permet d'atteindre une autonomie plus importante qu'un véhicule électrique à batterie. Il est produit à partir de gaz naturel, combustible émettant du CO 2 , ou, de manière plus ""verte"", par électrolyse de l'eau, un procédé gourmand en éléctricité. Les acteurs français du secteur se veulent donc optimistes, avec les récentes annonces françaises, qui font émerger ""de manière très concrète au niveau du gouvernement la volonté de remplacer le diesel par les nouveaux carburants, comme le gaz, le biogaz et l'hydrogène"", constate Charlotte de Lorgeril, associée au sein du cabinet Sia Partners. ""La France a fait un choix politique tourné vers l'électrique et aujourd'hui on voit que l'électricité ne peut pas répondre à tous les usages dans la mobilité"", ajoute-t-elle.

Mais pour aller plus loin, les industriels demandent un soutien de l'Etat via ""un plan hydrogène précis et inscrit dans la durée"", plaident l'Afhypac et Mobilité hydrogène France. La France a quelques grands acteurs, comme Air liquide ou Engie et tout un éco-système de PME et start-up (McPhy, Aaqius, Symbio FCell) mais qui ""sont très fragiles"" en l'absence du véritable démarrage de la filière, prévient Philippe Boucly. ""Il faut qu'on accélère sur les filières hydrogène ou électrique"", avait aussi confié début septembre à l'AFP la ministre des Transports Elisabeth Borne, estimant que ""l'Etat a aussi un rôle plus proactif à jouer pour aider à la structuration d'un certain nombre de filières sur des innovations de rupture"".

Technologie chère

Aujourd'hui, l'hydrogène reste une technologie chère. ""C'est compliqué d'avoir un modèle d'affaires, alors qu'il y a encore beaucoup de sujets à traiter"" pour réduire les coûts, dans la production d'hydrogène, l'infrastructure de recharge, ou la pile à combustible elle-même, ""surtout qu'il y a des concurrents"", comme le gaz naturel ou le véhicule électrique, explique Gaëtan Monnier, de l'institut IFP Energies nouvelles.

Ailleurs en Europe, d'autres pays se mobilisent, notamment en Allemagne avec les constructeurs Audi, Mercedes-Benz ou BMW et les géants du gaz Linde group et Messer. Alors que l'Europe est distancée pour la fabrication des batteries, le Vieux Continent ne semble pas vouloir rater le train de l'hydrogène, même s'il ne se concrétise qu'à long terme. ""Les Chinois essayent d'enterrer les véhicules thermiques parce qu'ils ont les batteries (...) donc l'Europe est en train de se questionner sur (la technologie) sur laquelle elle va miser"", explique Gaëtan Monnier.

Selon une étude commandée par les industriels du secteur, l'hydrogène pourrait représenter près d'un cinquième de l'énergie totale consommée à l'horizon 2050 au niveau mondial, sous réserve que des ""investissements significatifs"" soient réalisés, estimés à ""280 milliards de dollars américains d'ici à 2030""."

répertoriés au sein de la base de données Basol (voir article détaillé présentant la Basias et la Basol, deux bibles de l’histoire des sols pollués).

La ville la plus concernée est Vitry-sur-Seine, avec une quinzaine de sites à elle toute seule, avec notamment du dépôt de produits pétroliers, des activités chimiques, une centrale électrique. Suit Ivry-sur-Seine qui passe également la dizaine de sites. En termes de territoires, c’est l’EPT Grand Orly Seine Bièvre qui détient le record avec 57 sites sur 94, contre 21 pour Paris Est Marne et Bois et 16 pour Grand Paris Sud Est Avenir, plus étendu mais plus vert.

Sur les 94 sites identifiés comme à surveiller, 14 nécessitent actuellement des investigations complémentaires, concernant notamment d’anciennes stations service ou des activités de nettoyage à sec mais aussi de l’aéronautique, comme par exemple à Valenton avec le site de la société Alkan. “Le trichloroéthylène est présent dans la nappe et dans les gaz du sol. La pollution s’est étendue vers les immeubles d’habitation de la Cité des Polognes. Le rapport conclut à l’absence de risque pour les usagers du site et pour les habitants de la cité des Polognes“, conclut néanmoins le rapport. A Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, c’est le site de l’ancienne fonderie Le Metal Ouvre qui s’est révélé contenir des métaux toxiques, en concentrations supérieures aux valeurs de constat d’impact (VCI) et valeurs de définition de source sol (VDSS) sur le plomb. “Ainsi, pour le plomb, sur 47 analyses, on constate 19 dépassements de la VDSS (200 mg/kg) dont 18 dépassements de la VCI usage sensible (400 mg/kg), parmi lesquels 8 dépassements de la VCI non sensible (2 000 mg/kg), avec une concentration maximale de 9 140 mg/kg. La majeure partie de ces dépassements est constatée dans la couche superficielle (0 – 1 mètre)“, détaille le site du ministère. Suite à ces investigations réalisées en 2002, un projet de crèche a été abandonné et c’est une maison de retraite qui s’est installée. Concernant le suivi, l’affaire a même été en justice puisque “l’arrêté demandant la surveillance de la nappe et la réalisation d’une EDR au propriétaire ( mairie) a été annulé par jugement du TA en date du 15/02/2007“, note le ministère.

"Un train à l'hydrogène, est-ce vraiment propre ? - Libération","Tue, 14 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpYmVyYXRpb24uZnIvZnV0dXJzLzIwMTcvMTEvMTQvdW4tdHJhaW4tYS1sLWh5ZHJvZ2VuZS1lc3QtY2UtdnJhaW1lbnQtcHJvcHJlXzE2MDk3OTkv0gFxaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGliZXJhdGlvbi5mci9mdXR1cnMvMjAxNy8xMS8xNC91bi10cmFpbi1hLWwtaHlkcm9nZW5lLWVzdC1jZS12cmFpbWVudC1wcm9wcmVfMTYwOTc5OS8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Pour la première fois, un train régional va être propulsé à l'hydrogène en Allemagne. Un indéniable progrès écologique par rapport au diesel, mais la fabrication de ce nouveau carburant reste très polluante.

Il affiche fièrement le sigle HO en blanc sur sa peinture bleu ciel. HO, pour «hydrogène zéro émission». Le train régional Coradia iLint d'Alstom, propulsé par des piles à combustible, a effectué une première sortie bluffante de silence (et Libération y était). Le train est déjà un succès, au moins commercial : la région de la Basse-Saxe en a acheté quatorze exemplaires, ce qui représente un contrat de 200 millions d'euros avec trente ans de maintenance. Le jour de cette démonstration, Jörg Nikutta, le patron de la division allemande d'Alstom, a déroulé son argumentaire : «Avec la pile à hydrogène, nous parions sur l'avenir pour relever le défi de la réduction des émissions de CO 2 et répondre aux immenses besoins de transports collectifs propres.»

Voilà pour la communication, mais qu'en est-il réellement ? Evacuons tout d'abord le point moins compliqué et le plus évident : oui, c'est la réalité, le train qui fonctionne à l'hydrogène est propre. Il n'est pas exactement «zéro émission», puisqu'il rejette de la vapeur d'eau, créée par la transformation de l'hydrogène en électricité. Seulement de la vapeur d'eau. Et donc, aucune émission de gaz à effet de serre (CO 2 ). Rien à voir, donc, avec les trains circulant au diesel.

A La Rochelle, autre première : un bus maritime assurant la liaison maritime Vieux Port-Minimes est désormais propulsé grâce à une pile à hydrogène. L'embarcation, nommée Galilée, est une avancée de plus dans l'ambition de La Rochelle de devenir le premier «territoire urbain littoral zéro carbone», indique Brigitte Desveaux, vice-présidente de la Communauté d'agglomération de La Rochelle en charge des transports, à nos confrères de Sud-Ouest.

Fracturation hydraulique

Ces innovations seraient vraiment une bonne nouvelle pour la planète, s’il n’y avait pas un problème de taille : l’hydrogène n’est quasiment pas présent dans la nature, contrairement au pétrole ou au gaz. Pour l’utiliser, il faut donc le fabriquer.

Revenons à notre train allemand : il fonctionne grâce à des piles alimentées elles-mêmes par deux grands réservoirs d'hydrogène présents sur son toit. Ce carburant est fourni par l'entreprise allemande Linde, qui le fabrique à partir du reformage du méthane. Cette méthode est d'ailleurs la plus souvent utilisée dans l'industrie (95% des techniques de production selon un rapport de 2008 de l'Institut national de l'environnement industriel et des risques). En quoi consiste-t-elle ? Pour schématiser, de la vapeur d'eau est chauffée à très haute température et mélangée avec du méthane, ce qui crée une fracturation hydraulique. «Sous l'action de la vapeur d'eau et de la chaleur, les atomes qui constituent le méthane (CH 4 ) se séparent et se réarrangent en dihydrogène (H 2 ) d'une part et dioxyde de carbone (CO 2 ) d'autre part», explique le site Futura-Sciences.

Cette technique pose donc un problème : elle produit du CO 2 . Et un autre : elle provoque des émanations de méthane dans l'atmosphère, un gaz encore plus polluant que le CO 2 . Pour l'industrie automobile, Auto-Moto avait relevé que la production d'hydrogène pour faire rouler une voiture un kilomètre rejette l'équivalent de 100g de CO 2 … C'est-à-dire à peu près le même score que pour le diesel.

Un hydrogène vert est-il possible ?

Alstom est bien conscient du problème et Jörg Nikutta, le responsable déjà cité, expliquait à Libération que son entreprise allait prochainement utiliser un hydrogène vert «grâce à l'électrolyse de l'eau». Cette méthode, reproduite chaque année dans les salles de chimie des collèges de France et de Navarre, consiste à décomposer l'eau à l'aide d'un courant électrique. Un hydrogène vert, vraiment ? Pas tellement : car la production par électrolyse nécessite une puissance électrique très importante. Ce qui la rend très coûteuse. Et dépendante du nucléaire, une énergie neutre en terme d'émission de CO 2, mais pas du tout en terme environnemental.

Avec cette technique, l'une des solutions pour arriver à un hydrogène propre serait d'utiliser de l'électricité verte. «Il existe une méthode alternative qui s'appuie sur l'électrolyse de l'hydrogène, en exploitant des courants d'eau pour produire de l'énergie électrique qui sera ensuite utilisée pour la production d'hydrogène et d'oxygène, relate par exemple Numerama. Malheureusement, ce processus nécessite beaucoup d'énergie.» Dont, en outre, 20% est gaspillée.

Alors, faut-il jeter le H avec l'H2O du bain ? Pas encore, puisque des recherches sont en cours pour dénicher un hydrogène vraiment propre : celui qui serait fabriqué à partir de la fermentation. En décomposant des matières organiques (la biomasse), des bactéries produisent en effet de l'hydrogène. «Les gaz de fermentations sont récupérables et filtrables pour concentrer le méthane qui servira à produire l'hydrogène. Couplé à un mode de capture du CO 2 , les émissions seraient nulles», pose Natura-Sciences.

A voir quel sera l’avenir de cette solution par biomasse. Celui de la propulsion à hydrogène, lui, passerait plutôt par une amélioration de la méthode par électrolyse : c’est notamment sur ces questions que se penchent les grands groupes. La résolution des problèmes liés à l’hydrogène pourrait en effet passer par une industrialisation. En clair, quand toutes les voitures rouleront à l’hydrogène, il faudra bien faire efficace, économe et pas cher. On semble s’y orienter : en janvier dernier, en marge du forum de Davos, un «conseil de l’hydrogène» a été créé. Il regroupe des constructeurs (Honda, Hyundai, Toyota, BMW, Daimler, Kawasaki, Alstom), un groupe minier (AngloAmerican) et des producteurs de carburant (Shell, Total, Air Liquide, Linde, Engie)."

En septembre 2014, Jean Moreau, cofondateur de la jeune pousse, fait la connaissance de la directrice de la Fondation Carrefour, Sophie Fourchy. L’activité de la start-up éveille son intérêt : la redistribution des invendus alimentaires à des réseaux d’associations, grâce à une plateforme digitale connectant en temps réel l’offre et la demande. Cela s’inscrit parfaitement dans l’engagement du groupe contre le gaspillage, pour la RSE, et réduit la facture de traitement des déchets.

Ce sera du 8 au 10 novembre 2017.

Sur le site, le Chinois Sinohydro rassure que le projet évolue selon un planning validé par la hiérarchie qui est le maître d’ouvrage, en la personne du ministre en charge de l’Eau et de l’Energie. Peu avant le démarrage des travaux du barrage proprement dits, le gouvernement du Cameroun a signé un contrat commercial avec l’entreprise chinoise.

Entre-temps, l’impact environnemental a été tel qu’il y a eu le déplacement de plus de 420 ménages, l’ennoiement de la totalité des villages de Mbang Mboum, de Sangha, de Ndouar et dix-neuf autres localités impactées par le projet. L’on a aussi noté la perte des terres agricoles de tous les villages, le long du réservoir.

C'est en janvier 2016 que l’Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) a accordé un prêt d’un montant de 182 milliards de FCFA au gouvernement camerounais, afin de financer le projet de construction d’un barrage hydroélectrique d’une capacité de production de 75 MW sur le fleuve Bini à Warak.

Ce projet intègre également la construction de lignes d’évacuation d’énergie (70 Km en 225 Kv) et d’électrification rurale (30 Kv), ainsi que la réhabilitation et la construction de voies d’accès au site. La mise en service de cette infrastructure énergétique est prévue pour le quatrième trimestre 2018.

L'économie hydrogène : notre futur modèle de société durable ? - Hybrid Life,"Wed, 29 Nov 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5oeWJyaWRsaWZlLm9yZy9lY29ub21pZS1oeWRyb2dlbmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"À l’occasion du COP23, le conseil de l’hydrogène (Hydrogen Council) regroupant 18 industriels majeurs, a présenté une étude pour promouvoir le potentiel de l’économie hydrogène. Un nouveau modèle de société organisé autour de l’hydrogène, un nouveau vecteur de transport d’énergie «propre». Cela peut amener à bouleverser la carte mondiale de production d’énergie et de notre quotidien. Décryptage Hybrid Life…

Intitulée «Hydrogen Scaling Up» (voir le PDF complet sur ce lien), les industriels venus de différents horizons (Air Liquide, Alstom, Audi, BMW, Daimler, Engie, GM, Hyundai, Shell, Total, Toyota…) ont voulu montré aux politiques et au grand public, le formidable potentiel de «l’économie hydrogène», ses applications et sa feuille de route de déploiement des infrastructures.

Concept lancé par GM durant la première crise pétrolière, l’économie hydrogène vise à substituer entièrement le pétrole, pour être le vecteur d’énergie principal de l’économie mondiale. L’hydrogène étant l’élément le plus abondant sur Terre, il a aussi la propriété d’avoir la densité énergétique la plus élevée ( 142 MJ/Kg, contre 45,8 de l’essence et 0,5 de batterie Lithium-ion). Il permet à la fois de générer de l’électricité (grâce à un système de pile à combustible), mais c’est également un gaz inflammable qui peut générer de la chaleur en combustion.

L’hydrogène est donc vu comme une manière de stocker l’énergie «bon marché» à l’échelle mondiale. Les industriels voient l’hydrogène comme un vecteur d’énergie qui leur permet de mutualiser les différents types de production d’énergie, palier le problème de l’intermittence de l’énergie renouvelable et de pouvoir le redistribuer, avec un «format unique» dans diveres applications (fabrication de l’engrais Azote, alimentation des véhicules, génération de l’électricité, chauffage domestique…).

Contrairement de la littérature sur le sujet, je vais commencer par vous parler de la production et de la distribution, puis des applications. Probablement que beaucoup d’entre vous sont connaisseurs du sujet, j’ai donc envie de vous épargner le charabia des lobbies industriels et de vous analyser les vrais enjeux de l’économie hydrogène.

Economie hydrogène : la production, le bouleversement de la carte mondiale

Actuellement, le Japon est LE pays le plus développé en matière de l’économie hydrogène, et le gouvernement japonais montrera Tokyo comme une référence de la «Hydrogen Society» à l’occasion des JO 2020. Ceux qui sont contre l’hydrogène (généralement les défenseurs de l’économie batterie lithium) considèrent que l’hydrogène est encore majoritairement issu de la filière pétrolière et l’hydrogène ne serait que le prolongement de notre dépendance vis-à-vis des énergies fossiles et du secteur pétrolier.

Ils n’ont pas totalement tort (j’y reviendrai) mais ils oublient que le Japon est un pays qui souhaite réduire sa dépendance aux énergies fossiles.

Les décideurs du pays du soleil levant sont parfaitement conscients que ce qui a poussé le pays à s’engager dans une guerre mortifère contre pays le plus puissant du monde, c’était justement l’embargo du pétrole américain. N’ayant plus que quelques mois de réserves de pétrole, le pays n’a eu d’autres choix que d’envahir l’Indonésie (colonie néerlandaise), mais auparavant il fallait neutraliser la flotte américaine (d’où le bombardement de Pearl Harbor). Bref, c’était la petite parenthèse historique !

Dans le graphique japonais ci-dessus, le Japon a en effet prévu de pouvoir s’alimenter en hydrogène, qui peut être produit à la fois dans les pays disposant des ressources fossiles (grâce au charbon, gaz naturel ou pétrole) et/ou dans une région densément équipée d’éoliennes et de panneaux solaires. Je suppose qu’il s’agit de l’île Hokkaido beaucoup moins peuplée que l’île principal, mais cela peut aussi être un pays étranger.

On peut crier au scandale concernant l’utilisation des ressources fossiles pour produire de l’hydrogène, mais en réalité, les japonais sont beaucoup plus malins que ça. Ils n’utilisent pas le pétrole ou le gaz naturel pour produire de l’hydrogène. Ils utilisent du charbon basse qualité…le lignite (houille brune). Ce charbon qui contient beaucoup d’eau et qui est facilement inflammable, ne peut pas être transporté et ne peut qu’alimenter les centrales thermiques à proximité de la mine. C’est pour cette raison qu’il est bon marché. L’Australie, le pays qui contient 38 milliards de tonnes d’ignite extractibles, ne peut que se réjouir du projet japonais : importer ce charbon australien sous forme d’hydrogène liquéfié (lien).

Une nouvelle carte mondiale de l’énergie est donc en train d’être dessinée, quand on lit que la Norvège rentre en compétition avec l’Australie pour fournir l’hydrogène au Japon : grâce à l’énergie renouvelable, l’hydrogène norvégien coûte 0,18€/Nm3 contre 0,22€/Nm3 de l’hydrogène australien. Or sachant que 1 Nm3 équivaut à environ 3 kWh d’énergie, cela donne un coût de 0,06 €/kWh. À comparer donc au tarif de 0,05 €/kWh du gaz naturel en France, et au tarif de 0,21 €/kWh de l’électricité au Japon.

Le Japon, malgré son poids diplomatique proche de zéro, va donc pouvoir se frayer un chemin parmi les puissances pour sécuriser son approvisionnement énergétique.

Actuellement le pétrole du Moyen Orient est sécurisé par les Etats Unis et ses alliés, le gaz naturel par les russes, tout comme l’uranium africain est sécurisé par la France. Il faut garder à l’esprit que tout ceci se fait par le biais de «moyens diplomatiques et militaires», qui se concrétisent par des conflits armés, des coups d’état, etc. Le Japon ne peut pas se permettre de cette politique. En effet, sa constitution (fixée par les Etats-Unis après guerre) l’empêche de toute intervention extérieure. D’ailleurs, la technologie de batterie n’est pas épargnée par ce problème. Le Japon a souffert en 2010 de la suspension de l’exportation chinoise des terres rares ; tandis que récemment, Renault a été épinglé pour avoir utilisé du cobalt de Congo (CDC) pour la batterie de Zoé, dont l’exploitation violerait des droits de l’Homme. Pour les plus intéressés d’entre vous, vous pourrez lire le rapport du Sénat sur le thème «La sécurité des approvisionnements stratégiques de la France».

Du point de vue de l’Etat français, l’hydrogène pourrait apporter de nouvelles perspectives énergétiques :

En interne : les régions rurales, peu peuplés, peuvent se transformer en gigantesque producteurs d’énergie renouvelable et exporter le surplus d’hydrogène aux autres régions voire d’autres pays. Actuellement ça ne sert à rien car la production d’électricité ne peut que rester locale (sinon trop de pertes).

En externe : c’est aussi une autre perspective qui s’ouvre, puisqu’il donne la possibilité d’importer de l’hydrogène produit par les panneaux solaires implantés massivement dans le désert du Sahara.

Actuellement, le développement de l’énergie renouvelable est fortement bridé par la capacité de stocker les excès de production pour pouvoir les restituer plus tard. La Californie produit tant d’énergie solaire le midi, qu’elle doit payer les Etats limitrophes pour qu’ils utilisent l’excès d’électricité (lire l’article). L’Allemagne rencontre également des problèmes similaires. Stocker cette énergie sous forme d’hydrogène semble être une bonne solution au problème, même si on perd environ 60% dans la transformation.

Notons que la logistique de l’économie hydrogène génère également de nouvelles opportunités industrielles : à l’image de Kawasaki (Japon) qui prévoit de construire des navires capables de transporter l’hydrogène sous forme liquide ou encore Chiyoda, dans l’infrastructure de transformation de l’hydrogène, pour qui c’est un composant facile à transporter (voir la présentation). Il est à noter que la France, avec Air Liquide, leader mondial en infrastructure gazière, a une belle carte à jouer dans l’économie hydrogène. Tandis qu’en industrie de batterie Lithium, nous sommes à la merci des coréens (LG Chem, Samsung SDI…), des chinois (BYD, CATL…) et des japonais (Panasonic…).

Saft et Bolloré, les deux acteurs français, ne totalisent qu’à peine 1 GWh de capacité de production annuelle (source), contre 6 GWh chez LG Chem.

Les applications de l’économie hydrogène : tout est-il possible?

Du fait de la polyvalence de l’hydrogène : générer de l’électricité via une pile à combustible, fournir la chaleur en combustion ou transformer une molécule en agissant comme un élément chimique ; les industriels comptent bien mutualiser cet élément dans divers secteurs.

Dans le secteur du transport : si à court terme, différents véhicules de tourisme ou utilitaires (voiture, bus, camion…) bénéficieront de la technologie pile à combustible pour pouvoir avancer en hydrogène, les industriels prévoient aussi de synthétiser du carburant à partir de l’hydrogène d’origine renouvelable, pour substituer le pétrole (quand il y aura pénurie) dans les navires ou avions.

En matière première : l’hydrogène peut servir de matière première dans le raffinage (combiné au CO2 recyclé) pour la production des produits chimiques, comme les solvants (méthanol) ou les matières plastiques (benzène). Dans le futur, l’hydrogène pourrait également être utilisé dans la réduction du minerai de fer en sidérurgie.

Dans le futur, l’hydrogène pourrait également être utilisé dans la réduction du minerai de fer en sidérurgie. En chauffage : compte tenu de sa propriété inflammable, l’hydrogène peut être mélangé au gaz naturel pour être injecté dans le réseau de gaz, afin de préserver cette énergie fossile. Actuellement on parle d’une proportion de 80% de gaz naturel mélangé à 20% d’hydrogène.

Il y a encore 10 ans, les spécialistes étaient pessimistes concernant la technologie de pile à combustible ou hydrogène, jugée beaucoup trop coûteuse.

Aujourd’hui, les projets de l’économie hydrogène fleurissent dans tous les secteurs, une preuve que malgré la percée de la technologie de batterie lithium, les industriels continuent d’investir dans la technologie de pile à combustible hydrogène.

Actuellement, les voitures pile à combustible (Fuel Cell electric vehicle, FCEV) jouissent d’une autonomie supérieure et un temps de recharge beaucoup plus court que les voitures électriques (Battery Electric Vehicle, BEV).



Le coût d’un véhicule hydrogène peut aussi être plus bas qu’une voiture électrique, puisque le prix de cette dernière est proportionnelle à son autonomie.

Dans l’étude de marché KPMG 2017 qui a sondé plus de 1000 dirigeants automobiles, 78% estiment que la pile à combustible sera la prochaine percée réelle de la mobilité électrique, tandis que 62% pensent que la voiture électrique ne s’imprégnera pas pour des raisons d’infrastructure.

En effet, s’il coûte environ 2 millions de dollars pour construire une station hydrogène (voir les projets chiffrés en Californie) et 250 000 dollars pour une Tesla Super Charger, il faut rapidement saisir qu’une station hydrogène (avec 2 pistolets) est capable de recevoir jusqu’à 20 voitures par heures, contre 2 voitures par heure pour Tesla Super Charger. L’équation est donc favorable à l’infrastructure hydrogène, qui nécessite d’ailleurs moins de place. Notons que si Tesla compte déployer les Tesla Super Charger V3 (350 kW), pour soutenir une telle puissance que l’infrastructure ne serait pas capable de suivre, le constructeur américain prévoit d’enterrer des packs de batterie alimentés par des panneaux solaires, le coût de l’installation serait beaucoup plus élevé.

D’autres applications de la technologie pile à combustible hydrogène voit également le jour, en particulier les engins qui nécessitent une forte puissance.

Le constructeur japonais Toyota, expérimente déjà l’utilisation des chariots élévateurs pile à combustible hydrogène, des bus hydrogène ou encore des camions de transport de marchandise alimentés par un système de pile à combustible.

À l’image de Tesla qui a récemment dévoilé son camion électrique Tesla Semi, Toyota a aussi lancé une première expérimentation du camion pile à combustible, capable de transporter 36 tonnes de marchandises, tout comme l’autre camion pile à combustible hydrogène Nikola One lancé en fin 2016, capable de faire 1900 km avec un seul plein d’hydrogène.

Et toujours dans le transport, c’est Alstom qui est en train de livrer 14 trains pile à combustible en hydrogène en Allemagne, pour remplacer les anciens trains au moteur diesel:

Ou encore le navire français Energy Observer, équipé d’un système de pile à combustible hydrogène pour être autonome en mer :

Et dans d’autres secteurs, les projets ne manquent pas et montrent que l’hydrogène est un vecteur d’énergie très intéressant dans de multiples applications.

En aéronautique, Safran a développé un générateur pile à combustible capable d’alimenter l’avion lorsqu’il est au sol, et surtout, le système de roulage électrique…évitant ainsi à l’avion de gaspiller son carburant quand il doit rouler sur les pistes de l’aéroport. Etant donné que chaque gramme compte dans un avion, la légèreté du système pile à combustible hydrogène est à privilégier (par rapport aux batteries) pour un usage de forte puissance électrique. En effet, faire rouler un avion de 200 tonnes n’est pas une mince affaire…

Mais il est également possible d’utiliser l’hydrogène pour faire voler un avion. Les ingénieurs allemand ont mis au point un avion électrique – pile à combustible hydrogène HY4, capable de transporter 4 personnes avec une autonomie de 750 à 1000 km. L’objectif final étant de développer un petit avion régional de 19 places «zéro émission».

Alors qu’au même moment, Airbus a dû abandonner son projet de construire en série l’avion électrique biplace (batterie Li-Po) E-Fan cette année, pourtant très prometteur sur le papier pour les aéro-clubs (90 € l’heure d’exploitation contre 120 € pour les thermiques). Si la raison n’est pas évoquée officiellement, l’autonomie réelle qui est plutôt limitée à 45 minutes, semble poser une réelle contrainte pour les utilisateurs. Est-ce que c’est pour cette raison qu’Airbus a abandonné ce projet prometteur, on ne saura probablement jamais.

Pour finir, il est également important de rappeler l’utilisation de la technologie hydrogène dans le domaine domestique. Le géant japonais Panasonic a commercialisé dès 2008, un système de chaudière / co-génération avec la technologie pile à combustible. Il fonctionnerait comme une chaudière de gaz classique, mais il a la capacité d’extraire l’hydrogène du gaz pour générer de l’électricité. Cela permet de réduire les émissions CO2 de 50%. Ce système arrive également en Europe via Viessman.

D’autres projets pour concrétiser l’utilisation de l’économie hydrogène dans le domaine domestique sont également en cours, et à terme le réseau de gaz sera remplacé par le réseau du gaz hydrogène, comme on peut constater sur le récent communiqué de Panasonic.

Les limites de #HydrogenSociety ?

Bien sûr, la nouvelle économie hydrogène est loin d’être parfaite, en tout cas sur le plan idéologique.

À l’heure où certains prônent une consommation locale, voir l’auto-consommation, le modèle de la société hydrogène est en quelque sorte une simple conversion «zéro émission» de la société pétrolière actuelle. Comme on peut voir dans la première partie de l’article, l’approvisionnement et la chaîne logistique de l’énergie hydrogène reste un circuit mondial. Le monde de demain aura donc toujours les pipelines, les énormes navires de transport ou encore les camions de distribution. Pas très sexy tout ça pour un citoyen écolo.

D’autre part, compte tenu du coût d’installation et de sa complexité, l’économie hydrogène ne permettra donc pas aux citoyens d’acquérir son indépendance énergétique vis à vis des géants pétroliers.

Le fait de voir son futur où «le citoyen parvient à dégager les géants pétroliers de l’ancien monde» repris en otage par cet ancien monde, via la technologie hydrogène, est sans doute une raison pour laquelle certains internautes ont des réactions très violentes contre la technologie hydrogène. Au point que le média américain Green Car Reports (équivalent de Automobile Propre) a publié un article «Pourquoi la voiture hydrogène rend fou les défenseurs de la voiture électrique?».

Il y a évidemment d’autre raisons plus techniques pour critiquer l’hydrogène : le coût de l’infrastructure, le coût du plein d’hydrogène, les pertes énergétiques dans la production d’hydrogène…etc. Mais soyons clairs, la vraie division est dans cette vision du futur de la société. Le «dégagisme» est aussi en train d’arriver dans le monde économique : l’envie de mettre fin aux grands distributeurs alimentaires, aux géants automobiles, aux géants pétroliers…

Or, en regardant lucidement l’histoire des révolutions depuis 2000 ans, je regrette de vous dire que l’on n’a jamais mis fin à la domination des puissants, on a simplement substitué une tête par une autre tête. Si jamais un monde «tout électrique» arrivait, il se peut que notre dépendance vis-à-vis des producteurs énergétiques se transforme en dépendance à celle des producteurs de batteries. Le Moyen-Orient se fait remplacer par la Corée du Sud et la Chine, tandis que votre abonnement chez Engie se transformerait en abonnement chez Solar City.

Alors quel modèle pour notre future société durable ?

A la vue des différents décryptages de la situation, il est encore trop tôt pour prédire quel sera le vecteur d’énergie principal de notre prochain modèle de société.

Entre le choix d’un carburant universel, plus simple pour la distribution à grande échelle mais dépendant d’anciens acteurs pétroliers ou un modèle d’auto-consommation qui nécessitent un recours massif à la batterie, certes à l’échelle plus locale, ce sont deux visions de la société qui s’affrontent. Derrière ces visions, c’est aussi l’affrontement de deux camps industriels fort différents qui cherchent à assoir leur domination.

On ne saura donc prédire avec certitude quel modèle dominera le futur. Peut-être qu’un équilibre des deux modèles combinant les avantages de l’un et l’autre serait l’idéal. Et vous chère lectrice, cher lecteur, quelle est votre réflexion sur ce futur énergétique ?
