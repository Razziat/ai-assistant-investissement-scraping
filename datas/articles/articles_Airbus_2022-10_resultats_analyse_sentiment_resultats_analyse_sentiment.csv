Airbus Beluga delivers Airbus satellite to Kennedy Space Center - Airbus,"Mon, 17 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0xMC1haXJidXMtYmVsdWdhLWRlbGl2ZXJzLWFpcmJ1cy1zYXRlbGxpdGUtdG8ta2VubmVkeS1zcGFjZS1jZW50ZXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"First Airbus Eurostar Neo satellite successfully launched just hours before its twin arrived at KSC

Second Eutelsat telecommunications satellite to join its twin in orbit within a month

BelugaST fuelled with 30% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) for Toulouse departure

A special aircraft landed at the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral in Florida this weekend: the Airbus BelugaST (A300-600ST). It delivered the Airbus-built HOTBIRD 13G satellite for Eutelsat. This happened a few hours after its twin, HOTBIRD 13F, was successfully launched by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.

The spacecraft are the first members of the new “Eurostar Neo” family of Airbus telecommunications satellites, based on a next-generation platform and technologies developed with the support of the European Space Agency (ESA), and others, including the Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales (CNES) and the UK Space Agency (UKSA).

This milestone also marks the first time since 2009 that the Beluga has visited the USA – when it transported the International Space Station European module “Tranquility”. For this latest mission, the Beluga used 30% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) for its departure flight from Toulouse – reflecting Airbus’ decarbonisation ambitions.

“It is a true honour to consecutively showcase two satellites for our customer Eutelsat: two pieces of European technology at the iconic Kennedy Space Center,” said Jean-Marc Nasr, Head of Space Systems at Airbus. “The ability of Airbus to field an autonomous European solution is underscored by the transportation of our satellites in the unique Beluga aircraft – a true example of pan-Airbus synergies!” Beluga and Hotbird at KSC by Pléiades Neo

Once they reach their orbital position, these two satellites, with more efficient power and thermal control systems than their predecessors, will be able to broadcast more than 1,000 television channels across Europe, Northern Africa and the Middle East. They will also enhance Eutelsat’s ability to provide connectivity for more than 135 million people, as they replace three Eutelsat satellitescurrently in orbit.

With the advent of the new BelugaXL, based on the larger A330-200 platform, the existing BelugaST fleet is progressively being made available for outsized freight transport services globally. Since the launch of the new Airbus Beluga Transport service in January, the BelugaST has performed missions for various customers worldwide.

Amazon Air adds 10 Airbus A330-300s to its global fleet - About Amazon,"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 13:34:18 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFib3V0YW1hem9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RyYW5zcG9ydGF0aW9uL2FtYXpvbi1haXItYWRkcy0xMC1haXJidXMtYTMzMC0zMDBzLXRvLWl0cy1nbG9iYWwtZmxlZXTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In 2016, our first aircraft, “Amazon One,” took to the skies. This was a major milestone in the development of an air cargo network that would enable us to transport customer packages across longer distances in shorter timeframes to continue to keep the promises we made to customers on fast, free deliveries.

Amazon's Airbus A330-300 livery rendering.

Fast forward to 2022, we’re still emerging from a global pandemic and evolving our network to continue to meet customer demand. During the past two years, we added more aircraft to our fleet (we have more than 110 in our global network today), launched new facilities including our U.S. air hub at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport in Hebron, Kentucky and our European air hub at Leipzig/Halle Airport in Germany, and leaned into sustainable initiatives such as electric ground service equipment and sustainable aviation fuel. It was meaningful to reach so many more customers in different parts of the world during a time when many were relying on us to get them what they needed while they lived and worked from home. Now, when I look at our network, I know that we have the structure we need to be nimble when the expected and unexpected, like Hurricane Fiona and Hurricane Ian, occur.

Today, I’m excited to share that we are innovating within Amazon Air again, adding 10 Airbus A330-300s, leased from aircraft lessor, Altavair, to our aircraft fleet. The aircraft are currently undergoing passenger-to-cargo conversion and will be the first A330 freighter conversions to operate in the U.S. when they enter our network in late 2023. At the same time, we’ll also begin phasing out some older aircraft whose tenure are nearing expiration. These A330s will not only be the first of their kind in our fleet, but they’ll also be the newest, largest aircraft for Amazon Air, allowing us to deliver more customer packages with each flight. Additionally, we are bringing on a new partner, Hawaiian Airlines, which will maintain and operate these aircraft on our behalf. This reflects the results they deliver as a renowned airline with their own A330 fleet. We’re thrilled to have these new partners joining us for this next chapter of Amazon Air’s journey, and I can’t wait to watch these birds take flight next year.

At the heart of this exciting update are the people and partners who work across the Amazon Air network–from Amazon associates and leaders across our global sites, to technicians and carrier pilots who maintain and operate our fleet of aircraft. I’m continuously humbled by their work and endless pursuit of excellence on behalf of our customers.

Keep your eyes on the skies—we have so much more in store for Amazon Air, and I can’t wait to share it with you.

Fly Amazon,

The story of Airbus: the genesis of a European giant - AeroTime,"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMzIzNTEtdGhlLXN0b3J5LW9mLWFpcmJ1cy10aGUtZ2VuZXNpcy1vZi1hLWV1cm9wZWFuLWdpYW500gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWVyb3RpbWUuYWVyby9hcnRpY2xlcy8zMjM1MS10aGUtc3Rvcnktb2YtYWlyYnVzLXRoZS1nZW5lc2lzLW9mLWEtZXVyb3BlYW4tZ2lhbnQvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"While Airbus is now considered to be an essential name in the aviation industry, the manufacturer came close to not existing at all.

Between political conflicts and commercial failures, the creation of the European aviation giant has not been without its challenges. Here, AeroTime explores the eventful genesis of Airbus.

Uncertain beginnings

In the 1960s, Europe’s fragmented industry had to face the giants across the Atlantic, such as Boeing, Douglas, and Lockheed, and break the monopoly that the North American continent had on the global commercial aviation industry. Dozens of smaller European plane makers were spread across France, Germany, and the United Kingdom.

Names like de Havilland, Sud-Aviation, or Dornier certainly were not unknown. As commercial aviation developed, Europe managed to design innovative aircraft such as the Comet, the Caravelle, and the legendary Concorde. But the continent’s internal market was far too small and competitive to sustain so many different brands.

As a comparison, 1,010 copies of Boeing’s first jet airliner, the 707, were built, while its most popular European competitor, the Sud-Aviation Caravelle, only racked up 277 orders.

Thus, in 1967, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom decided to team up and design a common aircraft: the A300, the world’s first twin-engine widebody airliner. The goal was simple: to pool the industrial capacity and areas of excellence offered by each country.

France was to be in charge of building the cockpit, and flight controls, Germany would assemble the fuselage and the cabin, and the United Kingdom would take care of the wings and the engines.

During a second proposal, a decision was made to design an aircraft compatible with several engines, including US-made ones, in a bid to attract customers across the Atlantic. In parallel, Rolls-Royce’s development of the RB207, specifically designed for the aircraft from the RB211, stalled due to a lack of funds and was eventually abandoned.

This led the British government to withdraw its participation from the Airbus venture. On May 29, 1969, at the Bourget Air Show in Paris, French and German representatives signed an agreement that marked the creation of Airbus Industrie, and the launch of the A300.

But the project was not entirely without British input. Hawker Siddeley lobbied to remain the sub-contractor of the A300 wings. The twin-engine wide-body airliner made its maiden flight in 1972. Success, however, was not instant.

A renewed European dimension

The 1970s marked Spain’s entry into the project. In 1971, the manufacturer Construcciones Aeronáuticas S.A. (CASA) acquired a 4.2% share of Airbus Industrie, leaving Aérospatiale (a merger between Sud-Aviation and other French manufacturers) and Deutsche Airbus (a joint venture of Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm and VFW-Fokker) each with shares of 47.9%.

In 1973, the A300 embarked on a tour of the American continent, flying through Brazil, the US, and Mexico. The technical demonstration, which included an efficient engine change in Chicago following a bird strike, seemingly paid off. The CEO of Eastern Airlines Frank Borman agreed to lease four A300 aircraft for the winter of 1978 and test them on domestic routes.

By then, Airbus’ backlog for the aircraft only included 60 orders and options. Thus, the potential order of 50 or more A300s, promised by Borman if the aircraft was suitable, was a welcome boost for the program.

After a short trial period, Eastern was convinced that the high-capacity aircraft, which was relatively inexpensive to operate, would be an asset and, in March 1978, placed an order for 23 A300B4s with nine options.

1979 marked the return of the United Kingdom, with British Aerospace, which had absorbed Hawker Siddeley in the meantime, acquiring a 20% share of Airbus Industrie.

By the end of the 1970s, Airbus held 10% of the global market share in its order book.

The decade of innovation

In 1983, Airbus’ second aircraft, the A310, entered service with the German national carrier Lufthansa (LHAB) (LHA). It featured innovative technologies, in particular, what Airbus calls its Forward-Facing Crew Cockpit, which allows flying with only two pilots and relinquished the need for a flight technician.

Five years later, the A320 narrow-body airliner introduced digital fly-by-wire and side-stick flight controls. The aircraft established Airbus as a major player in the aviation industry, with more than 400 orders before its first flight, compared to only 15 orders for the A300.

Throughout the 1990s, Airbus extended its aircraft catalog, launching two long-haul airliners, the A330 and A340, and diversifying the A320 family with the A318, A319, and A321. In April 2005, the takeoff of the A380, the largest civil aircraft in the world, amazed the whole world as a marvel of engineering, as Concorde had previously done.

Although, once again, innovation did not go hand in hand with commercial success.

At the same time, the helicopter division of both Aérospatiale and Deutsche Aerospace merged to form Eurocopter in 1992. With the most extensive catalog of rotorcraft of any manufacturer, Eurocopter soon became the largest helicopter manufacturer in the world. In 2014, it was renamed Airbus Helicopters.

2014 also saw the creation of Airbus Defence and Space from the different military and spatial units of the group. The division oversees the manufacture of the Eurofighter Typhoon fighter, the Airbus A400M Atlas transport aircraft, and the Airbus A330 MRTT tanker, as well as the design and manufacture of satellites for telecommunication, Earth observation, and geolocation.

European collaboration at its best?

Today, the company continues to grow its innovative vision of commercial aviation and is preparing to meet the challenges of tomorrow.

In September 2020, the European manufacturer unveiled three hydrogen-powered concepts it was working on in a program codenamed ZEROe. Airbus considers hydrogen power to be a “priority strategic axis” in its research and development on sustainable aviation.

In March 2022, Airbus performed a flight test on an A380 with one of its engines powered by 100% sustainable aviation fuel.

50 years after its creation, Airbus has become a symbol of successful cooperation between European nations. The giant holds around half of the global civil aviation market. In 2019, it even outdid its main competitor, Boeing, as the largest aerospace company by revenue.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999281167984009}",neutral,0.9999281167984009,0
"Families of crash victims rain wrath on Airbus, Air France - The Associated Press","Mon, 10 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2J1c2luZXNzLWZyYW5jZS1wYXJpcy02ZDU4Zjk4MjUxNmE2MTZkMjhmYWFlMDQ4ZTc1MjQyMdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS (AP) — Distraught families whose loved ones died in Air France’s worst-ever crash on Monday shouted down the CEOs of the airline and of planemaker Airbus as the two companies went on trial on manslaughter charges for the 2009 accident over the Atlantic Ocean.

Cries of “Shame!” erupted in the courtroom after the executives took the stand.

The crash of storm-tossed Flight 447 en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris killed all 228 people aboard and had lasting impact on the industry, leading to changes in regulations for airspeed sensors and in how pilots are trained.

The victims came from 33 countries, and families from around the world are among the plaintiffs in the case, fighting for more than a decade to see it come to trial.

“It’s very important that we made it to the trial stage. ... Thirteen years of waiting, it is almost inhuman,” said German Bernd Gans, who lost his daughter Ines in the crash. Another man came to the trial with a sign reading: “French Justice. 13 Years Too Late.”

The official investigation found that multiple factors contributed to the crash, and the companies deny criminal wrongdoing. The two-month trial is expected to focus on pilot error and the icing over of external sensors called pitot tubes.

An Associated Press investigation at the time found that Airbus had known since at least 2002 about problems with the type of pitots used on the jet that crashed, but failed to replace them until after the crash.

Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury took the stand on the opening day to say: “I wanted to be present today, first of all to speak of my deep respect and deepest consideration for the victims; loved ones.”

“Shame on you!” family members retorted.

“For 13 years you have shown contempt for us!” one shouted.

Air France CEO Anne Rigail met similar emotions when she told the court she was aware of the families’ pain.

“Don’t talk to us about pain!” rose an angry voice.

The presiding judge called for calm and the proceedings resumed.

Air France has already compensated families of those killed. If convicted, each company faces potential fines of up to 225,000 euros ($219,000) — a fraction of their annual revenues. No one risks prison, as only the companies are on trial.

Still, the victims’ families see the trial itself as important after their long quest for justice, and aviation industry experts see it as significant for learning lessons that could prevent future crashes.

The A330-200 plane disappeared from radar over the Atlantic Ocean between Brazil and Senegal with 216 passengers and 12 crew members aboard.

As a storm buffeted the plane, ice disabled the plane’s pitot tubes, blocking speed and altitude information. The autopilot disconnected. The crew resumed manual piloting, but with erroneous navigation data. The plane went into an aerodynamic stall, its nose pitched upward and then it plunged into the sea on June 1, 2009.

It took two years to find the plane and its black box recorders on the ocean floor, at depths of more than 13,000 feet (around 4,000 meters).

Air France is accused of not having implemented training in the event of icing of the pitot probes despite the risks. It has since changed its training manuals and simulations. The company said it would demonstrate in court “that it has not committed a criminal fault at the origin of the accident” and plead for acquittal.

Airbus is accused of having known that the model of pitot tubes on Flight 447 was faulty, and not doing enough to urgently inform airlines and their crews about it and to ensure training to mitigate the risk. The model in question — a Thales AA pitot — was subsequently banned and replaced.

Airbus blames pilot error, and told investigators that icing over is a problem inherent to all such sensors.

The companies’ “image, their reputation” is at stake, said Philippe Linguet, who lost his brother on Flight 447. He expressed hope the trial would expose the failings of Airbus and Air France — two major players in the industry and in the French economy — to the world.

Daniele Lamy, who heads an association of victims’ families, said they are bracing for a difficult trial.

“We are going to have to unfortunately relive particularly painful moments,” she said. But she called the trial a welcome opportunity after prosecutors initially sought to close the case.

“This will allow the family to express themselves, to express their suffering over 13 years,” she said.

"28 October, 50th Anniversary of the first flight of the Airbus A300 - Airbus","Fri, 28 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTEwLTI4LW9jdG9iZXItNTB0aC1hbm5pdmVyc2FyeS1vZi10aGUtZmlyc3QtZmxpZ2h0LW9mLXRoZS1haXJidXMtYTMwMNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"50 years ago today the first Airbus aircraft, the A300B, embarked on its maiden flight. On this historic anniversary we look back with pride and admiration at the aircraft and programme that were at the beginning of the Airbus story.

On 28 October 1972, the world’s first twin engined widebody commercial aircraft, the A300B1 development aircraft, MSN 1, bearing the registration F-WUAB, performed its maiden flight in Toulouse. The test flight crew were Captain Max Fischl, First Officer Bernard Ziegler, Flight Test Engineers Pierre Caneil and Gunter Scherer, with Romeo Zinzoni as Test Flight Engineer/Mechanic in the cockpit. The flight was initially scheduled for Friday 27 October but unfavourable weather conditions (fog) pushed it back by 24 hours. On the following day, Saturday 28th, conditions were better with some sunshine but with the risk of wind. However the weather was judged sufficiently good for the flight to go ahead. The flight lasted 1h 25 min. during which a maximum speed of 185kt (342.6Kmh) was reached at an altitude of 14,000ft (4,300m). Autopilot was engaged, moving surfaces were tested and landing gear retraction and deployment were performed. Upon return to Blagnac airport, strong wind gusts, the famous Toulouse “Vent d’Autan”, required a controlled crosswind landing which was expertly handled by Max Fischl.

Forging a collective European ambition

In the mid 1960s, various studies for a new 250-seat short-to-medium-haul aircraft were being considered by European aircraft manufacturers. The HBN 100 had been in discussion between Hawker Siddeley, Breguet and Nord Aviation, and alternative designs for a similar sized aircraft, the Galion, were also being considered by Sud Aviation. Germany’s MBB and VFW, later to collectively become Deutsche Airbus, had also set up a dedicated “air bus” study group. European airframers at the time, although leaders in many technological developments and having produced some excellent airliners, only had around 10% of the global market share, with the remaining 90% going to the three main American manufacturers. To say the stakes were high is an understatement. Only an aircraft borne of a transnational collaboration would be able to successfully challenge the long-established competition while substantially reducing the development costs for each of the participants.

By 1966, the studies had evolved into a joint European project, the French government appointed Sud-Aviation as its partner in the venture, whilst Deutsche Airbus and Hawker Siddeley would respectively represent Germany and the United Kingdom. Engine development was initially trusted to Rolls-Royce, who were to develop the power plants (RB.207) for the new “air bus”.

In July 1967, a framework agreement for ""strengthening European cooperation in the field of aviation for the joint development and production of an air bus” (a non-proprietary term used by the airline industry in the 1960s to refer to a commercial aircraft of a certain size and range) was reached by the French, German and UK governments, allowing detailed design work and planning to start in earnest. By this time the project had evolved towards a 270 to 300 seat aircraft (hence the A300 name).

In April 1969, the UK government decided to withdraw from the programme due to uncertain commercial prospects and because Rolls-Royce, who was positioned to be the “official” UK partner in the Airbus venture, had decided to focus its efforts on the development of a less powerful engine, the RB211, for the Lockheed Tristar and was not keen on developing another engine, the RB.207, for the Airbus. This resulted in the selection of the General Electric CF6-50A as the engine for the A300, with the additional benefit that it was a proven engine, hence reducing risks for the development and certification of a brand new airframe.



The A300 gets the green light

By the time of its launch, the aircraft's capacity had also been reduced to some 225 passengers, this at the request of the two initial potential customers, Air France and Lufthansa who did not require the larger 300 seater which British European Airways and Rolls-Royce were initially in favour of. As a result, the design was updated with a new fuselage cross-section which was able to accommodate eight seats in a row (instead of nine) with two aisles, and also two standard LD3 containers side by side in the belly holds. This could be achieved by slightly raising the floor of the cabin, making it the optimum fuselage cross-section for what would become a true twin-aisle wide-body. This new version was thus named A300B to reflect the new configuration.

At the 1969 Le Bourget Airshow, France and Germany formally co-launched the A300B programme. The signature ceremony between the French Transport Minister Jean Chamant and German Economics Minister Karl Schiller took place inside a specially constructed forward fuselage mock up.



To provide the necessary legal and governance framework for the programme, Airbus Industrie was formally established as a Groupement d'Intérêt Économique (Economic Interest Group or GIE) on 18 December 1970. Shareholders were the French company SNIAS, later to be called Aérospatiale (the merged Nord and Sud Aviation companies) and the West German company Deutsche Airbus, which was the legal entity representing MBB, VFW and Hamburger Flugzeugbau (HFB), each owning a 50% share. In October 1971, CASA of Spain acquired a 4.2% share of Airbus Industrie, with Aérospatiale and Deutsche Airbus reducing their respective stakes. Despite the British government having stepped away from the venture, Hawker Siddeley remained onboard in a private capacity as an “associate” partner to supply the A300’s wings on the design of which they had already substantially progressed at time of the programme launch. In 1977, Hawker Siddeley and British Aircraft Corporation merged to form British Aerospace and in January 1979, British Aerospace joined the Airbus consortium by acquiring a 20% share, further reducing the shares of the original partners to 37.9% each.



Keys to success

Successful international industrial cooperation, on an until then, unprecedented scale in the aviation industry was key to the A300’s success. Thanks to the knowledge acquired through the national aircraft programmes that predated the A300 (SE210 Caravelle, BAC111, HS121 Trident…) and the experience and lessons learnt through two important transnational cooperation programmes; Transall C-160, (between France and Germany) and Concorde (between France and Great Britain), the Airbus project had strong foundations on which to build the new programme.

Of course, the support of the founding nation governments meant that a political balance was also required when defining the workshare and responsibilities amongst the partners. This included not only the production of the sections for which each of the partners was responsible, but also its design and development as well as all the equipment that was to go into each section. The resulting industrial and organisational model was a rather natural and pragmatic distribution defined by the skills and areas of strength of each partner. This allowed each of the GIE members to bring their best competences and brightest minds to the table. We truly can speak in hindsight of centres of excellence in an age before the expression was widely adopted.

A300B lofting plates etching in the design office

Designing, manufacturing, assembling and marketing a cutting-edge and complex enterprise such as a new generation airliner by four nations with four different languages, cultures, historical differences and distinct ways of working was deemed by many at the time as not being the best recipe for success. In fact, it turned out that these differences were key to the successful completion on time and on quality of the first development aircraft. It went as far as dispensing altogether with building a “prototype” as had been common practice in the industry. Indeed, nothing was left to chance and extra care, attention and continuous refinement were implemented to ensure that risks, errors and misunderstandings were mitigated and that the nascent collaborative culture evolved in the right direction. An innovative policy of multinational critical design analysis meant that collective agreement was necessary at each step of the process, this allowed different technical approaches and solutions to be explored, and fostered cultural cross-fertilisation which is still a key feature of how Airbus works today. Another innovation was for each partner to supply their constituent assemblies for final assembly in Toulouse pre-equipped at section and subassembly level which vastly accelerated the final assembly process. As a result, the amount of work performed on the final assembly line, which also includes final ground controls, represented no more than 4 % of the total amount of work needed to build the aircraft. Internationalisation was also a unique facet of the A300 project with a clear policy of using an international supply chain to procure the very best equipment, systems and materials available at the time.

Production of the first A300B1, MSN 1 commenced in September 1969 and the completed aircraft was rolled out on 28 September 1972, only one month to the day before its first flight! Remarkably the workshare, responsibilities and specialisation of the industrial sites and the logistical “ballet” involved in the construction of the first A300 remains virtually the same for the current Airbus range of aircraft, albeit augmented by the progress and developments in design, production and assembly which have intervened over the course of the last 50 years.

The two subsequent aircraft to be produced continued to be used for flight test and development purposes before being sold to customers. MSN2 was the second – and last - A300B1 to be built. MSN 3 was the first A300B2. This stretched version of the initial A300B1 was developed at the request of Air France. Being 2.6m longer, the A300B2 could accommodate 251 passengers in a standard two class configuration which remained the standard for all subsequent A300B2 & B4 versions (the B4 had the same seating capacity as the initial B2 but with an increased range, allowing it to enter the medium range market) . All three aircraft underwent intensive flight testing and demo flight campaigns achieving type certification on 11 March 1974, less than 18 months after its maiden flight, and slightly ahead of schedule, on cost and with guaranteed performance met.



Variants and derivatives

In 1974 the A300B4, the longer-range variant with increased weight and additional fuel tanks went into serial production. The A300 subsequently proved to be a particularly efficient platform allowing for further development, and numerous variants were designed, tested and built over a programme lifespan of nearly 35 years. These include the A300B10, which was eventually launched under the designation A310 in 1978 and which first flew in April 1982. The A310 was a shorter, reduced capacity, medium-long haul version of the A300, but with a completely new wing. The A300-600, an extended version of the A300B4 with a redesigned rear fuselage section carried over from the A310 allowing for two additional seat rows and additional containers underfloor and incorporating many of the improvements introduced on the A310, would first fly in 1983. The A300-600F, a freighter version of the passenger aircraft, would enter into service in 1993. The A300B9 and A300B11 projects would eventually provide the basis for the A330 and A340 family of aircraft, with the same ground breaking fuselage cross-section that was introduced on the initial A300. Finally, last but not least, five A300-600ST “Belugas” would be built to meet Airbus’ internal requirements for increased oversized transport capacity and to replace the ageing Aero Spacelines Super Guppy fleet. Altogether 821 aircraft of the A300 family were produced in all configurations and types.



Innovative design features of the A300

Whilst the defining feature of the A300 was the fact that it was the first twin-engined widebody, constant design evolution across the family, along with the integration of new technology and materials, earned it a place in aviation history with many industry “firsts'': the first application of composites on secondary, and subsequently on primary structures, the first application of a two-man forward-facing cockpit for a twin-aisle with the A300 FFCC, the first use of electrical signalling for secondary controls and the introduction of both drag-reducing centre of gravity control and wingtip devices (introduced on the A300-600), and the first widebody designed for a two-man flight crew on the A310. With all of the A300’s innovations, Airbus was truly living up to its “setting the standards'' motto of the time.



The A300 today

At present, more than 250 A300/A310 aircraft are in operation with 37 operators. 75% of the fleet are freighters and it is the third most-operated freighter type worldwide. More than 60% are operated by four major customers which project operating their fleets until at least 2030. The A300/A310 Programme team ensures customer satisfaction is maintained throughout the current projected life cycle of the A300/A310 Family by supporting operations but also by proposing upgrades and improvements to further increase mission capabilities. 50 years later Airbus has evolved into a global company with manufacturing, assembly and sales and services activities spread across five continents. One of the lesser publicised ambitions, at the time, of the founders of Airbus was for the A300 to be the first in a family of commercial aircraft; In 1968 an early advertisement for the A300 stated it was “the start of something big”. Little did they know how prophetic those words would turn out to be!","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9994908571243286}",neutral,0.9994908571243286,0
5 reasons pilots love flying the A350 - Airbus Aircraft,"Thu, 06 Oct 2022 21:49:49 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vYWlyY3JhZnQuYWlyYnVzLmNvbS9lbi81LXJlYXNvbnMtcGlsb3RzLWxvdmUtZmx5aW5nLXRoZS1hMzUw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For each of the main pilot tasks (flying the aircraft - navigating & communicating - managing the aircraft systems - managing the mission) the A350 introduces innovative solutions to better support pilots by raising awareness and reducing workload.

Fly the aircraft with new generation Head Up Display and PFD



The A350 offers a new generation dual Head Up Display which provides pilots with enhanced situational awareness, projecting aircraft trajectory information on the external world, easing transition from IMC (Instrument meteorological conditions) to VMC (visual meteorological conditions) conditions. In addition, the new trajectory and energy symbologies are fully consistent between HUD and PFD (Primary Flight Display).



Navigate with improved Flight Management System (FMS)



Improvements and functions to anticipate certain failure scenarios are now included, significantly reducing the pilots’ workload. The pilot can play a virtual scenario such as single-engine failure or depressurization using the ‘What if’ function, to assess the capability of the aircraft following a degradation at any point along the route. The ability to fly precise trajectories through difficult terrain or for noise abatement reasons has also considerably improved with the introduction of RNP-AR capability.



Manage Systems with improved Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitoring (ECAM)



The A350 ECAM interface has been revisited with improved access to information. A dispatch function has been implemented to ease the crew’s workload during pre-flight dispatch. Also, normal checklists are fully integrated in the Multi Functional Display (MFD) with a dedicated interactive page and direct access through the Keyboard Cursor Control Unit (KCCU, the pilot’s “mouse”). These checklists are airline customizable. Isolation of abnormal situations improves readability and eases corrective procedures. The system pages are now displayed directly under the engine section, making the page easier to understand for all engine dependent systems like fuel, hydraulic, electrical systems.



Manage Mission with integrated and intuitive Electronic Flight Bag (EFB)



The EFB is an airline device (laptop or tablet) providing the Flight Crew with reference material such as navigational charts or operating manuals previously found in pilots' carry-on flight bags. On the A350, the EFB is integrated with the Onboard Information Systems (OIS) display. It helps the Flight Crew manage tasks more easily and efficiently with less paper. The OIS is also integrated with the KCCU. Furthermore, it benefits from the ‘OIS on centre’ function to improve crew coordination during briefings. Interactivity is further improved with the introduction of touchscreens allowing smoother interaction to manipulate charts.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999923706054688}",positive,0.9999923706054688,1

Euronaval 2022: safer oceans with Airbus - Airbus,"Thu, 13 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTEwLWV1cm9uYXZhbC0yMDIyLXNhZmVyLW9jZWFucy13aXRoLWFpcmJ1c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Maritime spaces are increasingly becoming potential sources of conflict. With 90% of goods around the world being transported by sea and 98% of digital data transiting through submarine cables, plus the vast array of marine life, energy and mining resources, maritime spaces are more than ever becoming strategic assets.

At Euronaval, starting 18 October 2022, Airbus will show the many range of ways our teams are pioneering to help protect these critical areas.

Gathering intelligence to safeguard oceans

70.8% of Earth is covered by water equating to a massive 361 million km2 of seas and oceans to be monitored. Gathering intelligence over maritime areas is a challenge of colossal proportions and Airbus has taken it on with the development of several dedicated systems - which includes an array of unmanned aerial systems ranging from light to long-endurance aircraft.

Aliaca is an onboard mini-UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) system chosen by the French Navy for the SMDM (Systèmes de Mini Drones aériens embarqués de la Marine) contract, which was signed in the last quarter of 2020. It covers the supply of 11 Aliaca systems (including 22 air vehicles) in a maritime version for the French Navy, as well as associated training and maintenance for the given operational conditions. Aliaca was certified and qualified by the French Armament General Directorate (DGA) in July 2022.

VSR700, the unmanned aerial system that is currently under development and has been designed to operate alongside other shipborne naval assets, will provide commanders with an improved tactical picture, greater search and rescue power, and bring to bear a highly capable autonomous platform in times of heightened threats. Its compact size and discreet silhouette enhance stealth, and its payload accommodates a host of long-range, high-performance sensors – the optimal capability enhancement for modern navies.

The third system is Eurodrone: a Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) with versatile and adaptable capabilities that make it the perfect platform for Intelligence, Surveillance Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) missions or homeland security operations. Its open architecture as part of the future-proof design will allow for growth and rescoping system capabilities as may be required by the future needs of customer armed forces.

Space also plays a key role in maritime surveillance missions. For more than 30 years, Airbus has delivered actionable interoperable intelligence that enables responses at greater speed and with greater certainty. With proprietary access to the world’s leading satellite constellations – including Pléiades Neo, which has an optical resolution of 30 cm – Airbus supplies sustainable satellite imagery and data solutions.

Leading the digital transformation

Gathering information is not enough. Extracting meaning and analysis from data and intelligence are where Airbus technologies make a difference.

With extensive experience in Command, Control, Computers, Communications, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance, Airbus launched its Multi-Domain Combat Cloud (MDCC) project, which uses cloud-based technologies to create a cyber-resilient collaborative network across air, land, sea space and cyber domains.

With this technology, each asset constitutes a connecting node regardless if it is a warship, a fighter jet, a headquarters or a tank and provides critical information to militaries.

Since 2002, Airbus has been developing, deploying and upgrading the SPATIONAV system to support the French authorities’ gathering of information, direct maritime surveillance and intervention at sea. The system provides them with a tactical picture of the maritime situation to prepare and conduct their operations related to maritime border protection, search and rescue missions, maritime navigation security, detection of illicit activities and environmental protection.

SPATIONAV covers 6,000 kilometres of French coastline monitored in real-time 24/7 by 750 operators thanks to a vast network of sensors (105 sites, 88 radars, 77 AIS stations and 8 equipped Falcons). In addition, the system integrates over 50,000 extra European and international tracks.

Safeguarding information and securing digital networks is also key to maritime operations. In response to cyber-attacks that have become a daily threat and are increasingly sophisticated, Airbus Defence and Space has developed a defensive cyber warfare system to secure military networks and protect data. It includes monitoring, warning, detection and response capabilities that identify the origin, target, criticality and impact of such attacks, enabling them to be countered with a suitable response plan.

A key to defending against cyber-attacks is being ready for these threats through preparation and training. Airbus’ CyberRange advanced simulation solution easily models information technology (IT) systems and operational technology (OT) systems to simulate realistic scenarios including actual cyber-attacks. It is used by many Defence customers including the French navy.

Operating in a rough environment

Operating at sea is a constant challenge. Having designed and built aircraft specifically for maritime operations for decades, Airbus has gathered a unique know-how that benefits our latest generation of naval aircraft.

The first of a new generation of helicopter, the H160M derives from the EASA-certified H160. It benefits from a low cost of operations and enhanced flight safety features. The H160M incorporates the latest technological achievements in European aeronautics.

To ensure a high level of availability while reducing operating costs, the H160M’s support and services needs were taken into account from early in its design phase.

As a naval asset, the H160M is a formidable addition to anti-surface warfare, naval force protection, maritime security, maritime environment monitoring and intelligence, and search and rescue. The civil version of the H160 can also be used by military and public operators for search and rescue (SAR) and surveillance missions. The French Navy has recently received its first out of six H160s configured for SAR operations.

The NH90 military helicopter is a modern, multi-role rotorcraft designed to meet the most stringent NATO standards. Developed in two versions – tactical transport (TTH) and NATO frigate helicopter (NFH) – the NH90 contains a unique, fully integrated mission system for operations in the most demanding conditions over land and sea, day and night. Over 170 NH90 NFHs have been ordered by seven different customers with more than 123 aircraft being delivered so far.

Advanced navigation and ship landing aids enable the helicopter to perform safe landings in day, night or adverse weather conditions, supplemented by a deck lock device for securing the touchdown in high sea states.

The NFH has fulfilled missions along the east coast of Africa, in the Persian Gulf, the Indian Ocean, the Caribbean, Mediterranean and northern waters. Its operational versatility and wide range of capabilities make it the most effective naval helicopter available today. It is a true force multiplier and an essential asset for any operation.

In the domain of maritime patrol aircraft, Airbus is considering developing an aircraft based on the highly successful A320Neo that would be designed for long range maritime patrol (MPA) including the most demanding anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and anti-surface (ASuW) missions.

Successful TEXUS 57 Launch – the weightless world above the Arctic Circle - Airbus,"Thu, 06 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIyLTEwLXN1Y2Nlc3NmdWwtdGV4dXMtNTctbGF1bmNoLXRoZS13ZWlnaHRsZXNzLXdvcmxkLWFib3ZlLXRoZS1hcmN0aWMtY2lyY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The TEXUS 57 sounding rocket was successfully launched on the first launch attempt on 1 October at 08:26 local time (06:26 UTC) from the Esrange Space Centre in Sweden to enable microgravity experiments in space. What is behind this long-lasting programme and what is its contribution to scientific research?

What is the TEXUS Programme?

TEXUS (Technological Experiments in Zero Gravity) is the world's most successful and longest lasting sounding rocket programme – the first TEXUS rocket launched in December 1977. Sounding rockets – also known as research rockets – launch scientific and technological experiments to the edge of space for a period of about six minutes before falling back to Earth. Put simply, TEXUS helps scientists conduct biological, material science and physical experiments under space conditions at a fraction of the cost. The programme also plays an important role in preparing experiments for the International Space Station (ISS). Customers include the European Space Agency and the German Space Agency working together with various universities.

How often do TEXUS rockets take off?

On average, two rockets every 18 months. For this purpose, two-stage, 13-metre-long Brazilian VSB-30 rocket motors have been used since 2005.The rockets are launched from the Esrange Space Centre – an almost unknown location in the very north of Sweden, above the Arctic Circle. Here, the scientific payload can be easily recovered and returned to the research teams less than two hours after launch.

What does a TEXUS flight involve?

In ballistic flight a TEXUS rocket reaches a peak altitude of about 260 kilometres. The flight, from lift-off to landing, takes about 15 minutes. For six minutes, an approximate weightlessness is reached, which is only about one ten thousandth of the Earth’s normal gravity. During the flight, the scientists can directly control and monitor their experiments from the ground using telecommand and video transmission. The data is collected during the flight by telemetry and after recovery of the payload. The rocket’s payload lands by parachute and is salvaged by helicopter with the support of Airbus and the Swedish Space Corporation, Esrange’s operator.

What was researched during the TEXUS 57 Launch?

One of the four research initiatives for this mission came from the Brandenburg University of Technology (BTU) whose aim was to study how heat and mass are transferred in fluids under space conditions. The mission results will be used in various applications like optimising heat exchangers in special cooling systems such as those used in satellites as well as for ground applications.

The first results are very promising and will be evaluated over the coming months.

Long-awaited Launch

The TEXUS 57 mission had to wait quite a long time for the launch attempt due to external influences. Apart from Covid-19, there was a fire at Esrange in August 2021 that caused significant damage to the launch facilities. Then at the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine war, the rocket was ready for launch and had to be removed, delaying the launch again.

What is Airbus' contribution?

Airbus engineers from different disciplines develop, integrate and test the experimental equipment. In collaboration with customers and scientific teams, Airbus engineers establish experimental concepts before thorough testing. Airbus Defence and Space also develops the ground support systems needed to control the experiments during the test phase in Bremen and the flight from Esrange.

What now?

Collaboration on the most successful and longest lasting sounding rocket programme is ongoing. The next two TEXUS launches are planned as a double launch campaign in April/May 2023 in order to push research and development even further.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999150037765503}",neutral,0.9999150037765503,0

Revenues € 38.1 billion; EBIT Adjusted € 3.5 billion

EBIT (reported) € 3.6 billion; EPS (reported) € 3.26

Free cash flow before M&A and customer financing € 2.9 billion

2022 guidance updated for FCF before M&A and customer financing



Amsterdam, 28 October 2022 – Airbus SE (stock exchange symbol: AIR) reported consolidated financial results for the nine months ended 30 September 2022.

“Airbus delivered a solid nine-month 2022 financial performance in a complex operating environment,” said Guillaume Faury, Airbus Chief Executive Officer. “The supply chain remains fragile resulting from the cumulative impact of COVID, the war in Ukraine, energy supply issues and constrained labour markets. Our strong focus on cash flow and the favourable dollar/euro environment have enabled us to raise our free cash flow guidance for 2022. The commercial aircraft delivery and earnings targets are maintained. Our teams are focused on our key priorities and in particular, delivering the commercial aircraft ramp-up over the coming months and years.”

Gross commercial aircraft orders increased to 856 (9m 2021: 270 aircraft) with net orders of 647 aircraft after cancellations (9m 2021: 133 aircraft). The order backlog amounted to 7,294 commercial aircraft at the end of September 2022. Airbus Helicopters registered 246 net orders (9m 2021: 185 units), with bookings well spread across programmes. Airbus Defence and Space’s order intake by value was € 8.0 billion (9m 2021: € 10.1 billion), corresponding to a book-to-bill ratio slightly above 1. Third quarter 2022 order intake mainly related to services across the Division's portfolio.

Consolidated revenues increased to € 38.1 billion (9m 2021: € 35.2 billion). A total of 437(1) commercial aircraft were delivered (9m 2021: 424(2) aircraft), comprising 34 A220s, 340 A320 Family, 21 A330sand 42 A350s(2). Revenues generated by Airbus’ commercial aircraft activities increased 8 percent year-on-year, mainly reflecting the higher number of deliveries including a favourable mix and the strengthening of the US dollar. Airbus Helicopters delivered 193 units (9m 2021: 194 units), with revenues rising by 9 percent mainly reflecting growth in services and a favourable mix in programmes. Revenues at Airbus Defence and Space increased 10 percent, mainly driven by the Military Aircraft business and the Eurodrone contract signature. Seven A400M airlifters were delivered in 9m 2022.

Consolidated EBIT Adjusted – an alternativeperformance measure and key indicator capturing the underlying business margin by excluding material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses – increased slightly to € 3,481 million (9m 2021: € 3,369 million).

EBIT Adjusted related to Airbus’ commercial aircraft activities increased to € 2,875 million (9m 2021: € 2,739 million). It included the non-recurring positive impact from retirement obligations recorded in Q1, partly offset by the impact from international sanctions against Russia. It also reflects a less favourable hedge rate compared to 9m 2021.

On the A320 Family programme, production is progressing towards a monthly rate of 65 aircraft in early 2024 and 75 in 2025. The groundwork continues throughout all sites to secure rate 75 and adapt to the higher proportion of A321s in the backlog, ensuring all A320 Family Final Assembly Lines become A321 capable. Preparation for the upgrade of the second A320 FAL in Toulouse is underway. All three test A321XLRs have now flown, with the aircraft’s entry-into-service expected to take place in Q2 2024. On widebody aircraft, the Company is exploring, together with its supply chain, the feasibility of further rate increases to meet growing market demand as international air travel recovers.

Airbus Helicopters’ EBIT Adjusted increased to € 380 million (9m 2021: € 314 million), partly driven by the growth in services and a favourable mix in programmes. It also reflects non-recurring elements booked in Q1, including the positive impact related to retirement obligations.

EBIT Adjusted at Airbus Defence and Space totalled € 231 million (9m 2021: € 284 million). This decrease mainly reflects the impairment related to the Ariane 6 launcher delay, the impact of rising inflation in some long-term contracts across the Division’s portfolio and the consequences of international sanctions, partly offset by the positive impact related to retirement obligations booked in Q1 and Eurodrone.

On the A400M programme, development activities continue towards achieving the revised capability roadmap. Retrofit activities are progressing in close alignment with the customer. Risks remain on the qualification of technical capabilities and associated costs, on aircraft operational reliability, on cost reductions and on securing export orders in time as per the revised baseline.

Consolidated self-financed R&Dexpenses totalled € 1,965 million (9m 2021: € 1,919 million).



Consolidated EBIT(reported) amounted to € 3,552 million (9m 2021: € 3,437 million), including net Adjustments of € +71 million.

These Adjustments comprised:

€ +349 million related to the dollar pre-delivery payment mismatch and balance sheet revaluation, of which € +123 million were in Q3;

€ +33 million related to the A380 programme, of which € +40 million were in Q3;

€ -219 million related to the A400M programme, of which € -1 million were in Q3;

€ -48 million related to the Aerostructures transformation in France and Germany, of which € -15 million were in Q3;

€ -44 million of other costs including compliance, of which € -10 million were in Q3.

The financial result was € -306 million (9m 2021: € -172 million). It mainly reflects the net interest result of € -166 million as well as a negative impact from the revaluation of financial instruments, partly offset by the evolution of the US dollar and the revaluation of certain equity investments. Consolidated net income(3) was € 2,568 million (9m 2021: € 2,635 million) with consolidated reported earnings per share of € 3.26 (9m 2021: € 3.36).

Consolidated free cash flowbefore M&A and customer financing was € 2,899 million (9m 2021: € 2,260 million), reflecting the profit translated into cash and supported by a favourable foreign exchange environment. Consolidated free cash flow was € 2,502 million (9m 2021: € 2,308 million). The 2021 dividend of € 1.50 per share, or € 1.2 billion, was paid in Q2 2022 while pension contributions totalled € 0.5 billion in 9m 2022. On 30 September 2022, the gross cash position stood at € 22.5 billion (year-end 2021: € 22.7 billion) with a consolidated net cash position(4) of € 8.0 billion (year-end 2021: € 7.7 billion).

Outlook

As the basis for its 2022 guidance, the Company assumes no further disruptions to the world economy, air traffic, the Company’s internal operations, and its ability to deliver products and services.

The Company’s 2022 guidance is before M&A.

On that basis,

The Company maintains its targets to achieve around 700 commercial aircraft deliveries and around € 5.5 billion of EBIT Adjusted in 2022.

The Company now targets around € 4.5 billion of Free Cash Flow before M&A and Customer Financing in 2022.

Glossary

KPI DEFINITION EBIT The Company continues to use the term EBIT (Earnings before interest and taxes). It is identical to Profit before finance cost and income taxes as defined by IFRS Rules. Adjustment Adjustment, an alternative performance measure, is a term used by the Company which includes material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses. EBIT Adjusted The Company uses an alternative performance measure, EBIT Adjusted, as a key indicator capturing the underlying business margin by excluding material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses. EPS Adjusted EPS Adjusted is an alternative performance measure of basic earnings per share as reported whereby the net income as the numerator does include Adjustments. For reconciliation, see the Analyst presentation. Gross cash position The Company defines its consolidated gross cash position as the sum of (i) cash and cash equivalents and (ii) securities (all as recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position). Net cash position The Company defines its consolidated net cash position as the sum of (i) cash and cash equivalents and (ii) securities, minus (iii) financing liabilities, plus or minus (iiii) interest rate contracts related to fair value hedges (all as recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position). FCF For the definition of the alternative performance measure free cash flow, see the Universal Registration Document, MD&A section 2.1.6.1. It is a key indicator which allows the Company to measure the amount of cash flow generated from operations after cash used in investing activities. FCF before M&A Free cash flow before mergers and acquisitions refers to free cash flow as defined in the Universal Registration Document, MD&A section 2.1.6.1 adjusted for net proceeds from disposals and acquisitions. It is an alternative performance measure and key indicator that reflects free cash flow excluding those cash flows resulting from acquisitions and disposals of businesses. FCF before M&A and customer financing Free cash flow before M&A and customer financing refers to free cash flow before mergers and acquisitions adjusted for cash flow related to aircraft financing activities. It is an alternative performance measure and indicator that may be used occasionally by the Company in its financial guidance, especially when there is higher uncertainty around customer financing activities.

Airbus and Korea Aerospace Industries deliver first Light Civil Helicopter - Airbus,"Fri, 07 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0xMC1haXJidXMtYW5kLWtvcmVhLWFlcm9zcGFjZS1pbmR1c3RyaWVzLWRlbGl2ZXItZmlyc3QtbGlnaHQtY2l2aWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sacheon, Airbus Helicopters and Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) have delivered the first Light Civil Helicopter (LCH) to a local operator, Gloria Aviation, following certification in September this year. Entering service in an emergency medical services configuration in December this year, this helicopter will be deployed to support critical life-saving missions in Jeju.

This key milestone came on the back of a successful industrial partnership which started in 2015 when the two companies jointly collaborated on the LCH and Light Armed Helicopter (LAH) development programmes.

The LCH completed prototype flights at the end of 2019. Other than its first application for emergency medical services, the helicopter will also be capably deployed for public service missions such as search and rescue, utility, law enforcement, and fire fighting.

The LAH prototype completed its maiden flight in July 2019, with the aircraft to be qualified in the coming weeks. This successful qualification will pave the way for serial production of the helicopter, which Airbus and KAI will jointly embark on by the end of 2022, for the Republic of Korea Army.

“KAI has been a long-time partner to Airbus on several strategic helicopter development programmes. We are happy to celebrate this first LCH delivery which will, with the upcoming LAH qualification, kick-start a new chapter for our partnership as we enter the serial production phase,” said Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters.

“We are also pleased to take our partnership a step further to prepare for the development of new variants that do not just meet the operational requirements of the end-user, but one that would bring tremendous technical and economic benefits to the local aerospace industry for years to come.”



Building on the successful completion of the LAH development, Airbus and KAI are preparing new joint development programmes. These helicopter programmes will leverage Airbus’ technical know-how in the field of helicopter drive systems and flight control systems, while tapping into KAI’s established local industrialisation expertise in the country.

The two companies first started their long-standing industrial partnership in 2006 when both parties jointly worked on the Korean Utility Helicopter, followed by the LCH/LAH development programmes. The LCH/LAH are next-generation 5-tonne class helicopters that have been developed to meet Korea’s requirements for local deployment in both civil and military sectors.

The enduring partnership between the two parties has also seen the delivery of over 250 kits to KAI to-date, with additional orders for future deliveries.

Airbus to join Amazon Air fleet with ten A330-300P2F converted freighters - Airbus,"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0xMC1haXJidXMtdG8tam9pbi1hbWF6b24tYWlyLWZsZWV0LXdpdGgtdGVuLWEzMzAtMzAwcDJmLWNvbnZlcnRlZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"HERNDON, Virginia, 21 October 2022 – Amazon Air has signed a firm agreement to lease ten A330-300P2F freighters from Altavair, taking advantage of the A330’s capacity and economics to help fulfil its one-day delivery promise to Amazon Prime customers. The aircraft will be operated for Amazon by Hawaiian Airlines, which has had A330s as a key element of its fleet since 2010. The ten airframes are being converted from passenger aircraft to freighters by Elbe Flugzeugwerke GmbH (EFW), the centre of excellence for Airbus Passenger-to-Freighter (P2F) conversions.

“We’re thrilled to welcome Airbus to our Amazon Air fleet,” said Philippe Karam, Director, Amazon Global Air Fleet & Sourcing. “These A330-300s will not only be the first of their kind in our fleet, they’ll also be the newest, largest aircraft for Amazon Air, allowing us to deliver more customer packages with each flight.”

Amazon Air transports customer packages over longer distances in shorter timeframes to deliver on its customer promise of fast, free delivery. The first of their A330-300P2F aircraft is expected to join the Amazon Air fleet in late 2023.

""The endorsement of our freighters by Amazon speaks volumes about the market value of the A330 and the position Airbus wide-bodies are gaining in the cargo market,” said Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer and Head of Airbus International. “Amazon has built a reputation around delivering their goods to our doorsteps with extraordinary speed and consistency, and we’re very proud that our aircraft are trusted to become a key link in that remarkable logistics chain.”

With advanced Airbus technology that includes fly-by-wire flight controls, the A330 offers an extremely capable platform for freighter conversion. Since the A330’s service entry in 1994, more than 1,700 A330s have been ordered, with more than 1,500 delivered – providing a large source of aircraft to support P2F conversions for many years.

While both A330-200 and A330-300 aircraft are eligible for conversion, the longer-fuselage A330-300P2F is particularly suited for integrators and express carriers, due to its high volumetric payload capability with lower-density cargo.

The A330P2F conversion program, launched in 2012, is a collaboration between ST Aerospace, Airbus and their joint venture EFW.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9825457334518433}",neutral,0.9825457334518433,0
Commercial aircraft services market to double in value by 2041 - Airbus,"Thu, 06 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0xMC1jb21tZXJjaWFsLWFpcmNyYWZ0LXNlcnZpY2VzLW1hcmtldC10by1kb3VibGUtaW4tdmFsdWUtYnktMjA0MdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Growth will require an additional two million people in the services sector

Recovery to pre pandemic levels by end of 2023

Toulouse, 6 October 2022 – Airbus expects the services market to recover to pre pandemic levels in 2023 and to double in value over the next 20 years - from $95bn today to over $230bn in 2041, according to its latest Global Services Forecast (GSF). As a result, the number of people working in aviation services, keeping the world's fleets flying on a daily basis, is set to increase by a further two million.

“Every day millions of people in services, hidden champions behind the scenes, keep our global fleet of aircraft flying. Alone the number of pilots, cabin crews and maintenance specialists is set to grow by a further two million by 2041”, says Philippe Mhun, Airbus EVP Programmes and Services. “Accelerated digitalisation of operations and maintenance as well as a higher proportion of latest generation aircraft in service will lead to a massive requirement for new skills and job creation, leveraging new tools and ways of working in order to further increase our sector’s efficiency, reduce fuel consumption and emissions.”

A compounded annual growth rate of 3.7%, will lead to a doubling in the value of the services market in the next two decades with a bigger than ever demand for highly skilled labour: 585,000 new pilots, 640,000 new technicians and 875,000 new cabin crews.

As operators focus more on their core business, services to improve aircraft availability and efficiency will increasingly be outsourced, boosting the market for those providers. These services will be driven by sustainability and enabled by digitalisation, connectivity and innovation, to maximise efficiency in support of CO2 net zero ambitions.

Mhun concludes: “The GSF confirms our strategy and we are ready. Customer experience is our priority. Customer value will be underpinned by excellence in sustainable services and new energy transition, fully leveraging our Airbus Skywise digital capabilities. Aviation services will remain one of the most advanced and international industries, keeping our customers and society at large at the heart of our operations.”

Air France and Airbus charged with involuntary homicide for Rio-Paris crash in 2009 - CNN,"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8xMC9idXNpbmVzcy9haXJidXMtYWlyLWZyYW5jZS1mbGlnaHQtNDQ3LWNyYXNoLXRyaWFsL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAVRodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDIyLzEwLzEwL2J1c2luZXNzL2FpcmJ1cy1haXItZnJhbmNlLWZsaWdodC00NDctY3Jhc2gtdHJpYWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris CNN Business —

The trial of two of France’s biggest companies began Monday over the crash of Air France flight 447 in 2009 that killed 228 passengers and crew.

The national flag carrier and Toulouse-based Airbus (EADSF) have been charged with involuntary homicide for their part in the disaster over the Atlantic.

Both companies were placed under official examination in 2011 for similar charges by prosecutors trying to determine responsibility for the crash. But those charges were dropped in 2019 after eight years of judicial scrutiny. Now, owing in large part to pressure from families and friends of the victims, they are back in court.

Air France denied the company was responsible for the crash and said the charges should again be dismissed.

“Air France will continue to maintain, as it has always done, that it did not commit any criminal fault at the origin of this accident and will therefore plead for acquittal,” Claudia Chemarin, a lawyer for the airline, said in a statement to CNN.

Airbus gave a similar statement to French newspaper La Tribune.

If convicted, the companies each face a fine of 225,000 euros ($219,000).

There was mystery surrounding the crash of the flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris from the outset. For one thing, most fatal aircraft accidents happen on take-off or landing: this disaster occurred mid-flight.

Then there was the debris. When searchers first found parts of the plane floating in the South Atlantic 400 miles northeast of the Brazilian coast they were in a relatively confined area. A catastrophic loss of cabin pressure, or a bomb, would have scattered debris over miles of the ocean.

The first recovered parts of the plane added to the mystery. Many, like the shelves from the galley, showed evidence of damage from what experts called “downward compression.” That is, the plane hit the water seemingly flat with extreme downward force, as if it had pancaked onto the water with little forward motion.

That is what accident investigators eventually concluded had happened. France’s Bureau d’Enquêtes et d’Analyses (BEA), which investigates aircraft accidents, found in 2012 that the plane was falling more than 10,000 feet per minute when it hit the ocean but had a forward ground speed of just 107 knots, about 123 miles an hour, well below the stall speed of the Airbus A330.

BAE’s accident investigators concluded that the initial cause of the crash was icing on devices called pitot tubes, sensors that are crucial to determining an aircraft’s speed and attitude. It was a problem that had affected a few Airbus aircraft in the past, but one which the company had not corrected.

The investigators found that once the sensors failed, the autopilot disengaged and the cockpit crew lost reliable readouts of flight data. Because the senior pilot on board was on a rest break, the two, more junior co-pilots took over, flying the plane manually. Within seconds, one of the two at the controls pitched the nose upward, apparently to gain altitude, but inadvertently put the A330 into a high-altitude stall.

Without sufficient forward speed, the Airbus began dropping like a stone. The two co-pilots signaled the senior pilot to come assist. But from the cockpit voice recordings, it is evident that without visual references in the pitch-black night, with unreliable instruments, none of the three understood exactly why the plane was falling.

For four minutes, as the plane plummeted downward from nearly 40,000 feet to the sea, the three tried desperately to figure out what was going wrong and what to do about it.

The charges against Airbus center on its failure to correct the known problem with the pitot tubes. Air France stands accused of failing to train pilots on how to respond to the kind of situation the crew faced.

“To say today that only the pilots are at fault is too easy, it is very exaggerated and therefore it is not the truth,” Philippe Linguet, who lost his brother in the crash, told CNN on Friday.

“We want to confront the accused with their faults and if the court recognizes these faults, the accused Airbus and Air France should be condemned,” he added.

The trial is expected last until early December.

By taking part in this exercise, the “cargo copter” operated in a dense robotic environment, validating the concept’s usefulness – particularly its modular design for easy, flexible and rapid swap-out of payloads and batteries.

“This was a great opportunity to trial our small-scale

demonstrator in realistic conditions”

Jens Federhen, X-Works, Airbus Innovation

The demonstrator was developed by Airbus’ UAS New Programmes group in collaboration with the company’s X-Works rapid prototyping team. A system-of-systems approach was applied with the goal of meeting military mission requirements that range from cargo transportation and ISR duties (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) to serving as a communications relay and a combat force multiplier.

Its validation occurred in highly realistic operational conditions during the REP(MUS)2022 military exercise, which was conducted in Portugal’s Troia Peninsula region from 12-23 September. Overall, REP(MUS)2022 brought together some 1,500 personnel to test the coordination of unmanned systems and experimental mission scenarios above the water, on the water and under the sea.

A challenging environment during REP(MUS)2022

“This was a great opportunity to trial our small-scale demonstrator in realistic conditions,” explains Jens Federhen, who leads the X-Works rapid prototyping team. “Performing the demonstrations in such a demanding environment – surrounded by six research ships, 11 warships and 120 uncrewed systems around us – was extremely challenging, and at the same time very productive, as we have been able to learn and create useful collaboration links.”

The sub-scale demonstrator of the future Airbus Multi-Mission and Transport UAS is a 35-kg vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) multicopter. Sized to accommodate a range of payloads, the “cargo copter” is equipped with the Airbus-developed DeckFinder™ all-purpose landing aid for automatic landings on ship decks.

Valuable guidance for the next step

According to Johannes Pittermann, UAS PORTFOLIO MANAGER and REP(MUS)2022 PROJECT MANAGER, Airbus’ participation also helped to answer some open questions for the multi-mission cargo drone’s full-scale concept, providing valuable guidance in follow-on design and development work.

For the full-scale version, Airbus UAS New Programmes envisions a drone capable of carrying payloads of more than 250 kg payload over a range of 300-plus km. Beyond the military applications, Airbus foresees a role for the Airbus Multi-Mission and Transport UAS in civilian use for, e.g. humanitarian and/ or disaster/crisis management.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9966400861740112}",neutral,0.9966400861740112,0

The Hotbird 13F satellite is built on the new Eurostar Neo spacecraft platform designed by Airbus Defense and Space, with funding support from the European Space Agency. The Eurostar Neo satellite design can accommodate additional payload capacity, and introduces more efficient power and thermal control systems than the previous generation of Eurostar E3000 Airbus-built satellites.

“It’s a huge new product, payload centric, more competitive than anything we have ever done,” said François Gaullier, head of telecommunications satellites at Airbus. “And we are more than happy to have developed this product, of which Hotbird 13F will be the first one to be launched.”

ESA provided about 130 million euros, or $126 million at current exchange rates, to help pay for development of the new satellite platform. Airbus funded the rest of the development cost with its own money under the umbrella of a public-private partnership.

Eutelsat, a Paris-based commercial satellite operator, was the first customer to sign up to use the new Eurostar Neo spacecraft platform. The launch of Eutelsat’s Hotbird 13F will be followed in November by the launch of a nearly identical satellite for Eutelsat named Hotbird 13G.

“This Eurostar Neo satellite has been a partnership project done with Airbus, and with the first customer Eutelsat,” said Elodie Viau, ESA’s director of telecommunications and integrated applications. “This Eurostar Neo is a new set of satellites that are very competitive, that are optimized to be (cost) effective, and to use electrical propulsion in a very optimized way to allow more and more payload capacity.”

On its journey toward geostationary orbit, Hotbird 13F will use PPS5000 plasma orbit-raising thrusters developed by the French company Safran. The fuel-efficient plasma propulsion system relies on xenon gas and electricity to generate thrust, rather than a conventional liquid rocket fuel like hydrazine. That reduces the weight of the satellite, allowing engineers to launch on a smaller rocket or add additional payloads to support more communications capacity for customers.

So far, Airbus has sold eight satellites based on the new Eurostar Neo platform, including Hotbird 13F. Other customers for the Eurostar Neo satellite design include the UK Ministry of Defense, which signed a contract with Airbus to build a secure military communications satellite on the new spacecraft platform.

According to an Airbus spokesperson, Hotbird 13F weighs 9,868 pounds (4,476 kilograms) at launch. The spacecraft is cocooned inside the nose cone of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket, awaiting liftoff during a launch window opening at 11:26 p.m. EDT Friday (0326 GMT Saturday). The launch window extends until 1:22 a.m. EDT (0522 GMT).

The forecast team from the U.S. Space Force’s 45th Weather Squadron predicts a 90% chance of favorable conditions for liftoff Friday night.

The 229-foot-tall (70-meter) Falcon 9 rocket will blast off from pad 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, powered by a first stage booster making its third flight to space. Nine kerosene-fueled Merlin 1D engines will generate 1.7 million pounds of thrust for the initial lift out of Earth’s atmosphere, then a second stage with a single Merlin engine will fire two times to inject the Hotbird 13F spacecraft into an elliptical, or oval-shaped, geostationary transfer orbit.

The first stage booster will return to a landing on a SpaceX drone ship parked east of Cape Canaveral in the Atlantic Ocean.

The rocket’s payload fairing protecting the Hotbird 13F satellite will jettison about three-and-a-half minutes after blastoff, once the rocket reaches the rarefied airless environment of space. The final maneuver by the second stage engine is scheduled to begin around 29 minutes into the mission, followed by separation of the Hotbird 13F spacecraft at T+plus 36 minutes, 11 seconds, according to a mission timeline released by SpaceX.

The launcher’s guidance computer will target a geostationary transfer orbit ranging more than 20,000 miles above Earth.

After flying free of its SpaceX launcher, Hotbird 13F will unfurl solar panels and switch on its plasma propulsion system for several months of orbit-raising maneuver to reach a circular geostationary orbit more than 22,000 miles (nearly 36,000 kilometers) over the equator. The orbit-raising using electric propulsion takes longer than maneuvers relying on conventional rocket engines.

Hotbird 13F will orbit in lock-step with Earth’s rotation at 13 degrees east longitude.

By the middle of next year, Hotbird 13F should be ready to enter commercial service to start a 15-year mission broadcasting television programming to Eutelsat customers. Hotbird 13G, set for launch in November on another Falcon 9 rocket, will follow about a month after its twin satellite, heading for the same position in geostationary orbit.

“Hotbird 13F is the first of two satellites to be placed at the Eutelsat flagship 13 degrees east position, so this is an important event for us,” said Pascal Homsy, Eutelsat’s chief technical officer. “It will be the first satellite based on the electric propulsion Eurostar Neo platform by Airbus, fostering innovation and competitiveness in the European space industry.”

Thanks to improvements in satellite communications technology, Eutelsat will only need two new Hotbird satellites to replace the three aging Hotbird spacecraft operating at 13 degree east.

Homsy said the Hotbird fleet at 13 degrees east form the highest capacity satellite broadcasting system covering the Europe, Middle East, and North Africa regions, delivering 1,000 TV channels to more than 160 million homes. Hotbird 13F and 13G will broadcast signals in Ku-band frequencies.

“We have something like over 600 pay TV channels, 300 free to air channels, 450 high definition TV, and 14 ultra high definition channels broadcast from this flagship 13 degrees east position,” Homsy said. “We are able also to provide 500 radio stations and multimedia services.”

Viau, head of ESA’s telecom directorate, said the space agency encourages its partners to launch their satellites on European rockets. Eutelsat, which owns the Hotbird 13F spacecraft, decided to launch the mission on a SpaceX rocket instead of with an Ariane launcher, based at the European-run spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana.

There are only three Ariane 5 rockets left to fly before retirement of that version of the Ariane launcher. And Europe’s new Ariane 6 rocket is not expected to debut until some time next year.

“There was just no possibility to take a seat on Ariane 5,” Homsy said. “We cannot delay the launch of this Hotbird and its brother in a month simply because they have to replace the three existing satellites which are already operating at 13 degrees east, which are going to come to an end of life by the time the two new satellites will come into service. So we had a very harsh deadline.

“We could not take any risks, and the only option that was finally available at hand was to launch from Florida,” Homsy said. “We would have loved to have launched from Kourou, but it was just not feasible.”

"The best gets even better – A350 introduces new performance and Airspace cabin enhancements, benefitting ... - Airbus Aircraft","Wed, 26 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vYWlyY3JhZnQuYWlyYnVzLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzcm9vbS9zdG9yaWVzLzIwMjItMTAtdGhlLWJlc3QtZ2V0cy1ldmVuLWJldHRlci1hMzUwLWludHJvZHVjZXMtbmV3LXBlcmZvcm1hbmNlLWFuZC1haXJzcGFjZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Reinforcing the A350 Family’s position as the most sustainable large widebody today, with lower structural weight, enhanced performance, maximum versatility and more cabin space, choice and flexibility for all business models.

Airbus is introducing new A350 performance gains combined with various cabin enhancements for airlines and their passengers. This comes with a new product evolution standard now being delivered to airline customers. The performance improvements include weight savings, improved take-off performance, and increased Maximum Take-off Weight (MTOW) capability. The Airspace cabin improvements provide more space, choice and flexibility, covering a wider cross-section in the revenue passenger areas, more space at both the front and rear of the aircraft for new larger galleys, a new flight-crew rest compartment in the upper crown area, and a new large forward lavatory. The new standard also includes the option for the latest third-generation of electro-dimmable windows.

1. A350 PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS

Structural weight reduction – for lower CO2 emissions and greater productivity

When compared with the A350s in service today, the new standard brings a significant overall weight reduction. Both the A350-900 and larger A350-1000 benefit from these improvements – which account for up to 1.2 metric tonnes of weight reduction. Airbus achieved this by optimising systems, structures and installations on various areas of the aircraft. These included the electrical system installation with further optimisation in the crown with new cable concepts; cabin systems optimisation – such as a new single water tank, a new waste tank and lighter floor panel heating. In the mechanical system installation Airbus has introduced new composite ducts for a more optimised air distribution. There are also new nacelle and pylon structural weight-saving optimisations.

The A350 Programme has also taken the opportunity to increase the use of advanced materials such as carbon fibre to further reduce weight. For example in the wing structure we further optimised upper and lower wing covers, the landing gear support structure, and in the fuselage structure there is additional use of CFRP in the door surrounds.

Improved hot & high take-off performance for greater operational flexibility

These latest A350s will also benefit from an enhanced take-off performance especially when operating out of challenging airports (high altitude, short runways, hot weather etc.). To this end Airbus has introduced software evolutions which regulate the slat and flap positions, and has also implemented a faster landing gear retraction cycle – conferring greater obstacle clearance and reduced aerodynamic drag.

With these changes, the A350-900 could, on average, benefit from 3.5 additional tonnes of available take-off weight (e.g. for extra fuel and/or payload uplift) from a limiting runway, while the larger A350-1000 benefits from an approximate 2.5 tonne improvement. At some airports the potential take-off weight uplift gains could be improved by more than six tonnes (ie. at La Reunion and Mumbai), or by more than four extra tonnes (at Phoenix or Dublin). Overall, take-off weight improvements for the newest A350s would occur at around 50 airports currently operated by widebody aircraft. Airbus has also increased MTOW capabilities (now up to 283t for the A350-900 and 319t for the A350-1000) allowing them to maintain their respective maximum range capabilities, beyond 8,000nm, while carrying greater revenue payload than before.

2. A350 AIRSPACE CABIN INNOVATIONS

Wider Airspace cabin for further class-differentiation possibilities, flexibility and increased space

One of the most significant A350 cabin improvements is the additional cabin volume thanks to four inches of cabin width, bringing it to 225 inches. This extra room comes from re-sculpting the sidewalls which releases two-inches on each side along the cylindrical constant section.

Since the extra cabin width benefits all classes of passenger seating, the extra space can go towards widening the aisles, the armrests, seat-pan in between the armrests, the centre console in Premium Economy – or a combination of these. Moreover, while the A350 today already offers a 10-abreast option for airlines that need a high-density layout, the extra width in the latest A350 standard transforms the passenger comfort of previous 3-4-3 arrangement by now accommodating the full 17-inch wide industry standard economy seats – already used by many mainline carriers for their passengers.

Notably, compared with a nine-abreast Economy Class, the new 10-abreast offering could enable airlines to accommodate approximately 30 additional seats, in a typical three-class layout on their new A350-900s and the A350-1000s.

The wider cabin also allows for further class-differentiation and revenue-generation possibilities. For example, the original economy seats in a 3-3-3 arrangement – formerly 18-inch seats – now can become even wider – 18.7 inches – verging into ‘economy-plus’.

The wider A350 cabin brings even more Airspace comfort in 9- or 10-abreast economy (10-abreast shown)

Meanwhile the premium economy cabin can grow to offer 19 inch seats with a five inch centre console and an 18 inch aisle.

Designed-in flexibility for growth to 10-abreast seating

Flexibility is designed-in to the new cabin, so that airlines who initially select a nine-abreast 3-3-3 economy section could easily upgrade it in the future to the new 10-abreast layout. This flexibility is made possible the same seat rails, tracks and IFE interfaces will fit either nine or 10 abreast seating – without needing to change the floor attachment interfaces when changing the seats from one to the other.

Flexibility also applies to the supporting floor panels of the original A350 design – which were already sized for future higher seat densities, such as with the new 10-abreast option. Likewise, the aircraft’s plentiful air-conditioning flow capacity is matched for extra passengers, so no change was needed here either.

Retaining all the benefits of the original A350 Airspace cabin

In parallel, uprated insulation in the new sidewalls ensure that the acoustic and thermal insulation properties remain at the same industry-leading levels as before – and therefore the A350 remains the quietest aircraft in its category. The A350 is also renowned for having near-vertical sidewalls – thanks in part to its carbon-fibre fuselage construction which permits a non-circular fuselage cross-section. Passengers will therefore be pleased that the enlarged cabin cross-section retains this vertical sidewall feature, in particular so that the extra width is available at hip, shoulder and also at head level. Another benefit of the CFRP fuselage construction is the lower (6,000ft) cabin altitude pressure combined with improved humidity levels during cruise – leading to less overall passenger fatigue.

Longer cabin – larger galley & lavatory areas for improved cabin crew workspace and enhanced in-flight passenger service

In addition to the four-inch cabin width increase, Airbus engineers have also reclaimed 35 more inches of cabin length. This has been achieved by slightly shifting forwards the cockpit wall and optimising monument arrangements, while at the back of the aircraft, behind the last set of doors, the rear pressure bulkhead (RPB) has been repositioned by one frame rearwards – thus making extra space for an even larger rear galley area.

The resulting new redesigned monuments provide additional flexibility and catering capacity for operators, as well as improved working areas for flight crews. For example, the increased monument floor space available in the front-left area (forward Door1L) allows for up to four trolleys (previously three). Alternatively, a 50-inch wide PRM-capable, premium lavatory can now be installed there, sufficiently wide and also with a ramp for direct wheelchair access. It also includes an additional call button, handles plus other PRM-friendly features.

Full-size PRM lavatory option in forward cabin

Meanwhile, just opposite, on the right-hand-side (just forward of Door1R) the large galley offers useful worktop space, more space for galley-inserts (GAINS). This was achieved not only by moving the cockpit wall, but also by relocating the staircase to the Flight Crew Rest Compartment (FCRC) – previously in the front-right galley area – to the other side of the adjacent centre galley, aft of Doors1. Overall, the changes to the forward area galleys allow for up to three more trolleys than before, including the optional crew-rest.

New larger galley in forward area

When it comes to the rear galley area, the A350 cabin now brings the possibility of eXtra Large (“XL”) galleys that allow for up to six additional trolleys with an increase in floor surface area as well as effective working area for crews. Once again, flexibility is part of the A350, which is enhanced thanks to the extra space resulting from moving the RPB further back. The result is that it is now possible to offer airlines a new “V-shape XL Galley”, or an “ICE XL Galley” (ICE = Increased Cabin Efficiency). The latter can incorporate two lavatories – one either side (as did the previous ICE Galley), thus freeing-up extra space in the revenue passenger cabin in front of Doors4.

New ICE XL Galley – more work-space and room for six additional trolleys

Electro-dimmable windows – blocks 99.999% of light, reduces weight and is easy to maintain

Now that electro-dimmable window (EDW) technology has matured, Airbus is pleased to offer this solution to its customers of the newest version of the A350 Family now being delivered. Compared with previous designs, the latest generation of EDWs, developed by Gentex, darken twice as fast and become 100 times darker than the original version. In addition, they can now effectively block more than 99.999% of visible light as well as the infra-red energy from the sun (which also helps to keep the cabin interior cooler and thus reduce the load on the air-conditioning system). STARLUX Airlines, headquartered in Taipei, is the first operator to select these devices for its newly-delivered A350 aircraft.

Gentex supplies the latest 3rd-generation EDWs for the A350

The new EDWs also provide more comfort to passengers by allowing individual dimming of their windows while still looking outside if they wish. The windows also bring advantages for maintenance crews since they can be easily and quickly unclipped from the window bezels using a special tool (and without having to remove any seat or sidewall panels) and immediately swapped-out with a serviced replacement insert – which also makes for a fast turnaround.

3. SUMMARY

The new standard of A350s include a wide spectrum of value-adding product evolutions. Moreover this approach is the latest example of Airbus’ policy of continuously driving innovation to improve its aircraft products, based on its customer needs. The A350 Family, which was already the world’s most advanced and efficient new widebody, provides airline customers with increased performance, efficiency and revenue-generating possibilities. Furthermore, the A350’s Airspace cabin now offers even more space and choice for airlines to create a superior in-flight service and experience for their passengers.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999998807907104}",positive,0.9999998807907104,1

Airbus surprises with pact to add SES on supplier-furnished IFC - Runway Girl Network,"Mon, 31 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvYWlyYnVzLXNlcy1zdXBwbGllci1mdXJuaXNoZWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONG BEACH — In a surprise move, Airbus has inked a letter of agreement with SES, paving the way for the satellite operator to become the second managed service provider (MSP) in its supplier-furnished Airspace Link HBCplus catalogue. Following a contract signature with Airbus, SES is expected to bring its “combined MEO and GEO” Ka-band network through the Airbus ecosystem for the first time, said the European airframer.

The news, which was revealed at the Airline Passenger Experience Association (APEX)/IFSA Exhibition in Long Beach, California, comes just four months after Airbus unveiled its linefit HBCplus program at the Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg, where it announced Safran Passenger Innovations (SPI) as the terminal provider and hardware integrator, using ThinKom’s popular VICTS antennae, plus Inmarsat as the first managed service provider supplying its Ka-band satellite-powered Global Xpress service.

Under HBCplus, Airbus not only factory-fits the supplier-furnished inflight connectivity hardware to A320, A330 and A350 twinjets, but has overall responsibility to airline customers, providing support and warranties. Effectively, the program allows airlines to switch bandwidth suppliers without changing the hardware “so the aircraft doesn’t have to go through a rip-and-replace procedure that we now see happening actually in the United States”, Airbus upgrades marketing director Yannic Duifhuizen told Runway Girl Network last week at the APEX/IFSA show in apparent reference to Delta Air Lines’ massive rip-and-replace program.

As such, the SPI terminal will also serve as the conduit for SES’s Ka-band services as part of HBCplus.

The terminal includes “the latest and greatest ThinKom antenna. So, we have higher reliability — about three times more. There is parts interchangeability, so in case you operate a widebody and narrowbody single-aisle fleet, you can make use of the parts across the fleet,” noted Duifhuizen, adding that airlines can also select their desired level of performance. “[T]his really depends on how much the airline is willing to pay but you can go up all the way to 800 Mbps if your pockets are really deep; the technology and the hardware is capable of it and we’ve really embedded it as an SFE [supplier-furnished equipment] option in our catalog so that airlines can select it while configuring their aircraft.”

Highlighting the fact that the SPI terminal can support Inmarsat GX or SES Ka-band services, Duifhuizen said: “It’s one antenna to rule them all, as I like to say. That’s it guys, really, for the Ka frequency.”

Duifhuizen explained that the HBCplus model is “a triangle setup” involving the airframer, the airline and the MSP.

So we have a customer, Yannic Airlines [for example], then we have Airbus taking care of the aircraft hardware, the antenna, diagnostics… and then we have the MSP completing the triangle and the contract for the bandwidth will be between the airline and the MSP.

Will traditional aero ISPs (such as SITA, Thales and others) still have a role to play, RGN asked? “[T]hey will definitely exist between the airline and the MSP”, he said, if the airline wants that sort of arrangement.

If our customer wants someone in the middle to manage it — manage the portal or go different from what Inmarsat [or SES] is offering as a standard package — definitely from an Airbus point of view we allow that to happen. So that’s really between the airline and the MSP to define together.

For many IFC stakeholders, SES’s win of MSP status on Airbus’ new linefit SFE inflight connectivity program seems like a very ‘zero to sixty’ moment. While SES provides broadbeam and high throughput Ku-band satellite service to multiple inflight Internet service providers today — and its SES-17 Ka-band satellite is powering Spirit Airlines’ IFC via integrator and aero ISP Thales (with a retrofitted ThinKom Ka-band VICTS antenna) — SES itself is “not even an aero ISP”, noted one alarmed executive on the APEX/IFSA show floor.

So, Runway Girl Network put the question to Duifhuizen: what is SES bringing to the table that struck you guys as making sense?

“I think their innovative approach of looking at GEO and MEO satellites is really something that adds a lot of value in their offerings,” he replied, adding that SES’s forthcoming O3b mPOWER MEO network will ensure global coverage as part of this multi-orbit solution. The first mPOWER satellite is expected to launch in the fourth quarter.

In fairness to SES, the satellite operator has been talking about mPOWER for aero for several years, telling RGN back in 2017 that mPOWER would be capable of addressing, among other things, ”every aircraft flying in the world”. Two years earlier, SES told RGN that it didn’t want to be “the invisible guy” in aero.

In becoming a key player in Airbus’ new supplier-furnished HBCplus program, SES is certainly ensuring it’s not invisible. “SES along with its global partners are building a truly differentiated multi-orbit network, which is capable of providing the best IFC service in the air for both short-haul and long-haul commercial aviation markets. We look forward to concluding our partnership with Airbus and working together to bring these innovative multi-orbit global capabilities to the Airspace Link HBCplus ecosystem,” said SES chief strategy and product officer JP Hemingway in a statement.

Meanwhile, Airbus has indicated it is open to adding additional managed service providers to the HBCplus program, including those that support Ku-band connectivity. “[W]e’re in talks with everyone”, said Duifhuizen when pressed by RGN if the likes of OneWeb and SpaceX’s Starlink might be included. “We’re not excluding anyone at this stage and [are] absolutely in discussions.”

ThinKom does offer a VICTS antenna in the Ku-band. Intelsat (formerly Gogo) famously adopted the solution for its 2Ku-branded inflight connectivity kit, which is rolling off the line on Airbus A220s and A320s as part of Airbus’ buyer-furnished equipment catalog. And Panasonic Avionics selected a nextgen version of the hardware for future installs (having recently agreed to offer OneWeb-powered connectivity, Panasonic might also conceivably end up using the Sidewinder terminal for certain packages).

It’s unclear, however, if a terminal with the Ku-band version of VICTS will be selected when Airbus onboards Ku-band managed service providers for HBCplus. That’s the type of technology decision that is under review “and we’re looking at it as we speak”, Duifhuizen told RGN at the APEX/IFSA EXPO.

Solestial closes $10 million round led by Airbus Ventures - SpaceNews,"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9zb2xlc3RpYWwtc2VlZC1yb3VuZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SAN FRANCISCO — Solestial, a Tempe, Arizona company focused on solar energy for space applications, closed a $10 million funding round led by Airbus Ventures. AEI HorizonX, GPVC, Stellar Ventures, Industrious Ventures and other investors participated in the round.

“With this seed round, we will fully validate the technology and then prepare ourselves to transition to mass production of solar cells and panels,” Stanislau Herasimenka, Solestial co-founder and CEO, told SpaceNews. “We will do a lot of ground testing to predict how our panels will perform. And we will have multiple flights over the next year.”

Solestial panels have not flown yet. The company has delivered three sets of panels to customers. Herasimenka declined to name the customers, but said they included prime contractors and well-funded startups.

“I’m very happy to see a strong demand from different segments of the satellite manufacturing market,” Herasimenko said. “It seems that solar is a pain not only for the LEO [low-Earth orbit] megaconstellations that we are primarily targeting because they need a lot. Everyone would benefit from more affordable solar panels in space.”

Solestial intends to offer solar panels that are much less expensive than current panels, “mass producible” and space stable, Herasimenka said. “In space, it can last for 10 years and preserve some reasonable performance.”

In contrast to existing space solar panels, which Herasimenko compares to Lamborghinis, Solestial aims to bring the space industry something less costly and easier to manufacture like a Ford F-150 pickup truck. “It can serve as the workhorse for this industry that’s expanding and needs a lot of solar power,” Herasimenko said.

Solestial, formerly known as Regher Solar, spun out of Arizona State University, where Herasimenka earned a PhD in electrical and electronics engineering, conducted post-doctoral research and served as an assistant research professor.

The company was developing thin silicon solar cells for terrestrial markets. Noting the rapid expansion of the space sector in recent years, the company began testing the impact of radiation on its technology. Like other solar cells, Solestial solar cells can be damaged by radiation, but the company designed the cells to anneal, or cure the defects, at normal operating temperatures.

In addition to private investment, Solestial has won Small Business Innovation Research awards from NASA, the National Science Foundation and other government agencies with a combined value of more than $2.5 million.

“We are at a new inflection point for the aerospace and the energy industries,” Mat Costes, Airbus Ventures partner, said in a statement. “We’re excited to welcome the team at Solestial into our vibrant community of entrepreneurs working to advance breakthrough technologies to help solve critical, near-term planetary challenges.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9964616894721985}",neutral,0.9964616894721985,0
Airbus C295 onboards the sustainability journey with a first demo flight with SAF - Airbus,"Thu, 27 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTEwLWFpcmJ1cy1jMjk1LW9uYm9hcmRzLXRoZS1zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS1qb3VybmV5LXdpdGgtYS1maXJzdC1kZW1vLWZsaWdodNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus C295 is next in the race towards a more sustainable military aviation among Airbus Military Air Systems, following the first demo flight with SAF performed by Airbus A400M last summer. With a load of 29% blended SAF in its two engines, the C295 performed a successful first flight in Seville which helped to pave the way towards the final goal: to achieve 100% SAF capability for Airbus military aircraft and the decarbonisation of military aviation.

9.00 am on Wednesday, 19 October. The C295 team in charge of the SAF project met for an early morning briefing prior to the flight scheduled for that same day. The crew, the fuel team, engineers, pilots, flight test engineers… all gathered in the meeting room of the Airbus San Pablo Plant in Seville, going once again through the flight plan before take-off.

“With up to 50% of blended SAF, no modifications are required on the aircraft”, explained Jose Antonio Urbano, R&D Chief Engineer at Airbus Defence and Space. “So we are performing this demo flight to fully understand the aircraft behavior and to derive the necessary conclusion in preparation for future test campaigns with SAF”, he added.

The C295 would fly with a load of 29% blended SAF in both engines, so there was no need to modify the engines´ systems and the team faced no technical limitations on the preparation of the flight. “Although we know it would not be necessary with this SAF percentage used, the approach taken for this flight was to put the aircraft under the most demanding conditions in order to gather the necessary inputs for future 100% SAF operations. Our objective is to measure the aircraft performance with both fuels - Jet-A1 and SAF -, shut down and restarting the engines on flight, sudden movement of the power control levers to produce intense fuel demands, a rejected landing, manoeuvers of approach and go around after performing the final landing, requesting the maximum negative power”, explained Juan José Baeza, Flight Test Engineer at Airbus Defence and Space.

The wishes for a good flight concluded the briefing session. Then, the crew headed to the Flight Line, where the MSN163 awaited after having performed the requested ground tests and pre-flight tests on the previous days. The crew for this particular flight - Alejandro Grande, Alfonso de Castro, Pedro J. Martin and Juan J. Baeza - boarded the aircraft. Meanwhile, the team on the ground was busy with the refuelling manoeuvers, with a slight change on their normal procedure: The two PW127G engines of the MSN163 would be running, for the first time, with a load of 29% blended SAF.

Much like the A400M first flight with SAF conducted in July 2022, the drop-in fuel used for this flight is also the HEFA type (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acid) made of residuals of oils, vegetables and fats, and is also free of aromatics and sulphur. One of the main benefits of using SAF is reduced carbon emissions of 80% on average today over the entire lifecycle of the fuel.

Although the use of blended SAF doesn´t require any kind of technical modifications on the aircraft, challenges remain on the production side. “One of the biggest challenges we are currently facing is still the SAF supply. There is a high demand of SAF, but not many producers”, shared Urbano while MSN163 was still in the air. While SAF production currently accounts for only 0.1% of total aviation fuel production, this figure is expected to increase dramatically in the coming years to meet both growing demand from operators and upcoming SAF usage mandates.

After an almost two-hour flight, the MSN163 landed back in the Flight Line. Once on the ground, the crew nominated Baeza to proudly share the first impressions. “The flight has been of great value for us to prepare for future 100% SAF operations, and we feel privileged to be the ones to fly this aircraft with SAF onboard for the first time and be part of this exciting project”. Urbano echoed this feeling: “This demo flight helps us at Airbus Defence and Space to collect information and enable further research activities and technical work in order to reach the goal of 100% SAF capability for Airbus military aircraft”.

500,000 flight hours of the C295: The counter resets to `zero´

With 285 aircraft ordered and 38 operators in 34 different countries, the C295 has achieved more than 500,000 flight hours in all types of environments demonstrating the effectiveness and soundness of its system design. These are the amazing facts and figures of the `workhorse´. But now, as part of Airbus' commitment with the industry’s ambition to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, it is time to reset the counter to `zero´ and start counting the more sustainable flight hours Airbus will bring among its military aircraft, on its path towards the final decarbonization of military aviation.

Another step on the roadmap to cleaner military operations was taken in January 2022, when the Airbus C295 Flight Test Bed 2 (FTB2), the in-flight demonstrator of the European Clean Sky 2 (CS2) and the EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, started a flight campaign as part of Airbus’ desire for a more sustainable future aviation. The modifications on the FTB2 included new materials and technologies designed to achieve reductions in noise, CO2 and NOx emissions - all to be applied on different platforms in the future.

Paving the way towards 100% SAF

With the first A400M demo flight with SAF in July 2022, Airbus Defence and Space with its Airbus Military Air Systems unit kicked-off a flight campaign aiming to assess the impact of unblended SAF on military aircraft in view of certifying the use of SAF blends that exceed today’s 50% limit.

“With SAF playing a predominant role in the short, medium and long-term for decarbonisation of aviation, these test flights are part of the ambitious cross-divisional and worldwide project that contributes to the Airbus purpose: to pioneer sustainable aerospace for a safe and united world”, said Jean-Brice Dumont, Head of Military Air Systems at Airbus Defence and Space.

In parallel to using drop-in SAF which is already approved for aircraft using up to 50% blend of SAF, Airbus is currently exploring the feasibility of higher concentrations. Studies are currently ongoing to understand the benefits of flying with 100% SAF before the end of the decade.

The Spanish Air Force flew its C-101 of the “Patrulla Águila” with SAF on board

During the Spanish National Day on the 12th of October, the C-101 of the Spanish Air Force, which are part of the so called “Patrulla Águila”, flew with a blend of SAF on board.

This milestone is the result of the activities and tests undertaken in Madrid and Albacete by the SAF working group of BACSI led by the Spanish Air Force in collaboration with Airbus, Repsol and ITP Aero.

The ​A400M, C295, A330, Eurofighter, NH90, etc.​ joined the aerial display during Spain's celebration of its ‘National Day’ on 12 October - ​#FiestaNacional​. Around 4,000 personell from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Guardia Civil and the Spanish Legionnaires marched along Madrid’s Paseo de la Castellana during the military parade. The day is also ‘Armed Forces Day’.

BACSI is the ""Connected, Sustainable and Intelligent Air Base"" initiative that aims to increase the effectiveness, productivity, efficiency and sustainability of the Spanish Air Force through innovation, including technological developments related to sustainable aviation fuel.

Airbus aims to collaborate and work together with its customers, and will remain part of BACSI and the SAF working group in the future to support in the development of knowledge and capabilities for the use of SAF in different Spanish Air Force combat aircraft platforms.

"The Airbus A300 Legacy, 50 Years After First Flight - Aviation Week","Wed, 19 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L2FpcmNyYWZ0LXByb3B1bHNpb24vYWlyYnVzLWEzMDAtbGVnYWN5LTUwLXllYXJzLWFmdGVyLWZpcnN0LWZsaWdodNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The incident happened early on in the flight-test program. On Dec. 6, 1972, pilots Jacques Grangette and Pierre Baud took off for the 17th sortie of the A300B1. Two flight-test engineers and a mechanic were also on board. Shortly after they started the day’s test program, the two pilots found that the aircraft reacted excessively when they initiated turns. Baud, a former fighter pilot who had joined Airbus just three months earlier, was not too worried, but Grangette decided to cancel the rest of the schedule and return to base.

Origins

In hindsight, there were many instances in which the A300 program—and with it the entire Airbus project—could have failed for technical, commercial and political reasons. Some are more well known, such as the struggle to launch the program via an extremely tedious process spanning most of the 1960s and then kickstarting enough sales momentum in the 1970s to allow a level of production that made some economic sense. That flight on Dec. 6 turned out to be one of the many lesser-known hiccups, but in some ways it was a close call for the program. More on that later.

On Oct. 28, 1972, the first A300B1 test aircraft took off on its first flight, marking the start of an industrial, political and ultimately economic success story that is called Airbus and continues today.

The A300 itself was no commercial success. The 561 orders for all A300 versions and another 251 for the A310 before the program was terminated after 35 years of production tell their own story. At peak demand, Airbus delivered 46 of the aircraft in 1982 but only 19 the next year. From 1997 on, annual output was mostly in the teens. But the A300 was the catalyst for the launch of Airbus and a more united European aerospace industry that would eventually be able to compete with the big players in the U.S. at the time: Boeing, Lockheed Martin and McDonnell Douglas. The enormity of that accomplishment is indicated by the fact that only one of the three initial competitors is still building commercial airplanes and that none of the other national or binational European projects such as the BAC 1-11, Caravelle, Concorde or Mercure were successful.

In addition to starting to integrate the European industry, the A300 marked technical and industrial milestones. It was the first European widebody aircraft, and it introduced the concept of only two engines on a widebody, an idea met with massive skepticism by the establishment for years and one of the reasons the airliner’s commercial breatkthrough took so long. “The Americans told us we were crazy,” Gerard Guyot, one of the initial A300B2 and -B4 flight-test engineers, remembers. Boeing followed up with the 767, which entered service in 1982 and later superseded the A300 because of its longer range.

In the early 1980s, Airbus also switched to a two-pilot cockpit from the traditional setup of three on the -B2 and -B4.

“The real reason why this aircraft was successful is because it brought something different to the market,” Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Christian Scherer says. A widebody with two engines was “a new economic proposition,” he asserts. For comparison, Scherer points to the introduction of the Comac C919 this year. While gaining technological sovereignty in aviation is perfectly legitimate for a country the size of China, as it was for Europe in the 1970s, “[the C919] is an imitation of something that already exists,” he says.

The A300 was the design primarily of three men: Henri Ziegler, Roger Beteille and Felix Kracht. Ziegler was named as the first CEO of the Airbus Industrie consortium, Beteille became chief operating officer, and Felix Kracht, who had played an important role in the background, headed production.

In 1967, Kracht became managing director of Deutsche Airbus, which was to consolidate Germany’s workshare in the upcoming program. Along with Beteille and Ziegler, he was the mastermind behind the A300B, a technically ambitious aircraft. He pushed to use the best technology available, wherever it came from. “If the Chinese have the best engine, we will use it,” he once said. Beteille, Ziegler and Kracht also agreed that Airbus would not succeed in the long term with only a single product. The A300 would have to be developed into a family of aircraft if the Europeans were to compete with Boeing, Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas. To say so publicly early on did not seem prudent politically, so they kept the idea to themselves initially.

Of course, the idea of the family concept and communality even across different types of aircraft has been an Airbus leitmotiv for decades.

Efforts to pull together the project in the first place took years, mainly because of industry politics. The UK was largely focused on developing Concorde, which many expected would be the future of civil aviation. Only Hawker Siddeley showed an interest in the A300 project. Germany was initially lukewarm at best. And even in France, the picture was complex: Dassault was aiming at the civil market with its Mercure project, an aircraft roughly the size of the A320 developed by Airbus later. Like in the UK, France was working on the Concorde, and anyone not immune to prestige thinking wanted to be on the program. When the first A300 test aircraft was rolled out along with another Concorde prototype in September 1972, no one really paid attention to the Airbus, even though Concorde had been in flight tests for some years.

Key airlines were underwhelmed, too. Air France did not want any political interference in its order decisions. Lufthansa chief Herbert Culmann also made it clear what he would do if he felt that kind of pressure: “If someone wants to force me to buy this Airbus, I will take my hat and leave tomorrow.”

Engine Trouble

The project nearly died several times. The original A300 was planned to have around 300 seats, aimed at large-volume, short- and medium-haul routes mainly in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, rather than the U.S., a market dominated by incumbents Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. The aircraft was supposed to be equipped with Rolls-Royce RB207 engines. But in May of 1968, the British engine-maker presented a price for the power-plant that was out of the question for Beteille and Ziegler. “The difference in price of the RB211 for the Lockheed L-1011 was simply unacceptable, and we realized that Rolls was playing another game without admitting it,” Beteille said at the time. “By continuing in that way, we would have ended up with nothing more than a superb glider.”

The high price was Rolls-Royce’s way of saying that it actually did not want to build an engine for the A300. The company was already building the RB211 for the Lockheed L-1011, a three-engine aircraft that would later compete with the first Airbus.

On Oct. 6, 1968. Ziegler hosted Beteille at his home on Avenue Stephane Mallarme in Paris. The two prepared major changes to rescue the project and decided to put forward the idea of a scaled-down version about 80% the size of the 300-seater. That way, the Airbus partners would spend less on development and be able to choose between two engines: the RB211 and the General Electric CF6. Given the tense relationship with Rolls-Royce, it was no surprise that Airbus came to an an agreement with GE. The Pratt & Whitney JT9D was added later as a second engine option in the program.

Decades later, Rolls-Royce played a role at Airbus as part of the International Aero Engines (IAE) consortium building the V2500 and then delivering the RB211-derived Trent engines for the A330, A350 and A380 widebodies.

On May 29, 1969, the French and German governments agreed on a memorandum of understanding at the Paris Air Show to jointly develop the A300B. At the time, it was not a momentous event: The news was buried in this magazine’s report on the Paris Air Show (AW&ST June 9, 1969, p. 33). But the Airbus project was a reality.

Following the engine sourcing, the quandary over the A300’s wings nearly ended the development program. While UK-based Hawker Siddeley was willing to take on the wing work, the British government refused to provide development money. The German government came to the rescue by agreeing to fund the work, removing one of the last major hurdles to program launch.

Taking Flight

Soon it was time for flight testing, but few people took notice. The first flight was scheduled for Friday, Oct. 27, but dense fog prevented the crew—pilots Max Fischl, Bernard Ziegler, flight-test engineers Gunter Scherer and Pierre Caneill and flight-test mechanic Romeo Zinzoni—from taking off. “No one was interested in the A300,” recalls Barbara Kracht, daughter of Airbus founder Felix Kracht who spent her entire professional career working for the company. In 1969, she was in university and was able to attend the first flight only because it was delayed to a Saturday, when she had no classes.

Not only did very few people actually witness the flight—at least compared to later first flights that were orchestrated as social media events—Airbus’ hometown newspaper La Depeche du Midi in Toulouse also buried the story on an inside page. This magazine did the same (AW&ST Nov. 6, 1972, p. 22).

The A300’s first sortie was remarkable in several ways. Fischl and Ziegler (Henri’s son, hailed by his colleagues as a formidable test pilot and equally capable boss) put the aircraft through a wide range of configurations, speeds and altitudes, switched the autopilot on and tested all the important systems. It was a more comprehensive program than would be undertaken on a first flight today. There was one unplanned aspect: As the weather deteriorated quickly, Fischl had to land the aircraft with a 28-kt. crosswind gusting to 34 kt. As it turned out, that was above the aircraft’s later certification limit. Baud, who witnessed the landing from his position on the apron, says Fischl did well to put the A300 back on the ground under the circumstances.

Christian Scherer, 10 years old at the time, watched the A300’s first takeoff and landing from the rooftop of the old Toulouse airport terminal building. His father, Gunter, was onboard as the flight-test engineer. “[I was] holding my mom’s hand,” Christian Scherer recalls, and noticed that the landing included “quite a bounce” and that the aircraft was “going sideways” on the final approach because of the crosswinds. Only about 25 other people had assembled on that platform.

Baud had just joined Airbus a month before the first flight, and like most of the test pilots, he was still very new to the program when he participated in his own first test flights. One of them, the 17th overall, proved to be a critical one. Grangette, who was in command, instinctively felt that the strong lateral moves could not be right. After landing, the available data was analyzed and extreme loads were discovered on Frame 90, where the tailplane and fin are attached to the fuselage. “Thanks to Grangette’s decision, a disaster was avoided,” Baud says.

The fix was rather straightforward. Frame 90 was reinforced and the settings for the spoilers and ailerons were reduced so that loads would be guaranteed to stay well below limits. The new configuration was validated on the 42nd flight in February 1973.

Another issue took somewhat longer to fix. During avoidance maneuvers at high altitude, pilots discovered a risk of the aircraft pitching up and causing them to lose control, a phenomenon discussed since early in the development. As it turned out, a shockwave disturbed lift at the tip of the wing, leading to a loss in speed and increased angle of attack. Airbus engineers found that the only way to reduce the shockwave was to add a wingtip.

Much to the chagrin of Airbus, French weekly news magazine L’Express argued that the A300 program should be scrapped because of the allegedly poorly designed wing. The paper’s founder and editor, Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber, was a strong supporter of the Dassault Mercure project, so other considerations may have influenced his judgment of the wing situation.

The first two prototypes were A300B1s, but to make the aircraft more attractive to Air France, Airbus stretched the fuselage to accommodate three more seat rows, creating the B2. The third test aircraft was already a B2, a version that morphed into the B4 (with an added center fuel tank and Krueger flaps for additional range). The A300-600, introduced a decade later, involved a slight further stretch of the fuselage and featured several upgrades including the the forward-facing crew cockpit, Airbus’ move from a flight crew of three to two.

Tough Sell

Although flight testing was going smoothly overall, sales were not. Airbus was completely new to everyone in the industry. It launched demo tours around the world to introduce itself and the A300. The first was a monthlong Americas trip starting Sept. 15, 1973. Ziegler and Baud flew the aircraft from Toulouse to Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil (via Dakar, Senegal, and Recife, Brazil), to participate in a local air show. Guyot was also on board, as were mechanics, Airbus sales representatives—and a lot of spare parts, just in case.

“We were like an autonomous circus,” remarks Barbara Kracht, who was a member of the Airbus communications staff at the time.

“We were unknown, going from one city to another,” Guyot says.

Airbus was doing demo flights inviting pilots and local VIPs, trying to build trust in the aircraft and a lobby for future orders. “We were all driven by the same pioneer spirit,” Guyot says.

“What fascinated me was the emotional attachment to the mission,” Christian Scherer says of his father and colleagues. He says he was “in awe of the technology” as well as of the team’s ability to bridge cultures and come together. After all, his father was part of the first generation of German aeronautical engineers after World War II, who would not necessarily have been easily welcomed in France. But Gunter Scherer, who was a francophile, was an important player in building that bridge, his son recalls. And the members of French pilot school EPNER—in particular Jean Caillard, who became the elder Scherer’s mentor—received him with open arms. Gunter Scherer and Bernard Ziegler also later became best friends.

The A300B1 toured Brazil and some Caribbean destinations before stopping in West Palm Beach and Miami, Florida. Then, in Mexico City, Max Fischl’s piloting skills were required again: Upon takeoff from the high-altitude airport, an engine failed. Fischl turned the aircraft around, and mechanics repaired the engine. They were able to continue on the all-important U.S. tour as planned, with demos to Pan American World Airways, Trans World Airlines, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines, among others. But it would be several more years before Airbus would achieve its commercial breakthrough in the U.S.

Following the Americas tour, Airbus sent an aircraft to Southern Africa with stops in Niamey, Niger; Libreville, Gabon; Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban, South Africa; Kinshasa, Democratic Repulic of Congo; and Windhoek, Namibia. The Windhoek stop was also used for takeoff performance tests at high altitude.

Certification and Production

May 1974 proved to be full of milestones for the aircraft. Following certification by France and Germany in March, the A300 was certified by the U.S. FAA. Airbus embarked on a third demo tour, this time to the Asia-Pacific region, with many stops in Southeast Asia, South Korea, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. On May 10, Air France took delivery of its first B2 and started commercial services on May 30, operating the aircraft initially on the Paris-London route.

Things did not become easier for Airbus, however. “Most airlines were reticent about a twin-engine widebody carrying so many passengers,” Baud says. All widebodies at the time had at least three engines, and the Boeing 747 had four. Even the short- and medium-haul Boeing 727 was a three-engine aircraft. Beteille, Ziegler and Kracht were convinced nonetheless that they had the more efficient design and that the aircraft would be easier to repair than one with one engine installed high up on the tailplane. “We had to change the mindset of the airlines,” Baud notes.

That effort took years. During the first six years of production, Airbus built more A300s than it delivered, parking expensive “white-tails” waiting to be sold and handed over. Between 1974 and 1979, Airbus delivered fewer than 90 aircraft. The low point was 1976; Airbus did not receive a single order between the end of 1975 and mid-1977. Production was reduced to a nominal rate of just 0.5 aircraft per month, nowhere near any kind of profitable level. By comparison, after decades of industrial optimization, currently Airbus is not making money at a rate of five aircraft per month on the A350 program.

Into Operation

Air France was the first operator in 1974, followed by Air Siam at the end of the year. Korean Air and Hapag-Lloyd took their first A300s in 1975, and then Lufthansa, Air Inter, Indian Airlines and South African Airways the next year. At least some of the demo tours appeared to have paid off, with a good part of the early deliveries going to carriers in Asia, as Airbus had hoped, given the route structures and need to connect large metropolitan areas with high-capacity aircraft. Air Siam was a case in point: The carrier had leased aircraft MSN 8 for nine months to fly the Bangkok-Hong Kong route—the A300’s first extended-range twin-engine operational performance standards service early on in its operational history. The U.S. remained closed to the A300 for the time being.

In 1975, Bernard Lathiere took over the top position at Airbus from Henri Ziegler. He warned internally that the situation had to improve, and fast. Baud remembers people leaving the flight-test department that year because there was not enough work for everyone. But Lathiere, born in Kolkata (then Calcutta), India, turned out to be in the right place at the right time, as he excelled at what Airbus needed most in the mid-1970s: sales brilliance. Seeing that none of the other U.S. carriers were prepared to go for the A300, Lathiere approached the CEO of Eastern Air Lines, Frank Borman, a former astronaut. The carrier had not made money in 10 years but needed new aircraft, and Lathiere saw an opportunity.

The two agreed on a deal that is legendary to this day and one of the reasons why Airbus still exists. The OEM sent four A300s to Eastern to test in commercial operations free of charge for six months. The test satisfied Borman, and not only did Eastern buy the four aircraft, it ordered 23 more in 1977. The order gave Airbus the credibility it needed to build sales momentum over the coming years and put it in position to expand its portfolio further and build the A320, which was launched in 1984.

Christian Scherer joined Airbus as an intern in the contracts department in September 1984. His first assignment was the final paperwork for the PanAm order for 12 A300B4s. Then, on Dec. 21, four aircraft were delivered the same day. One was going to Berlin for PanAm’s air bridge service, and three more flew to New York via Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador. Scherer was on board of one of them. He recalls seeing the three parked next to each other during a refueling stop in a snowstorm at Gander: “That was one of the most emotional moments of my career.”","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.7570182681083679}",negative,0.7570182681083679,-1

Airbus Global Services Forecast (GSF) complements the aircraft market forecast, predicting growth from 23,000 airliners flying today to 47,000 flying daily by 2041, Figure 2.

By 2041 80% of the aircraft will be single-aisle with 20% widebody. The latest generation of airliners will represent 95% of the fleet after close to 40,000 new deliveries have replaced older aircraft, Figure 3.

The passenger traffic (in RPKs, Revenu Passenger Kilometers) grows by 3.6% CAGR in this period, and the yearly aircraft deliveries by 3.2% CAGR. The services related to this growing passenger and cargo market are outpacing them both, with a 3.7% CAGR.

The effects of the COVID pandemic are disappearing faster than predicted, and we will be back to a regular market for services end of 2023 or early 2024. The effect of the Pandemic will not be noticeable as the market grows from 2022 to 2041.

The largest services markets shift from Europe & CIS and North America to Asia-Pacific during this period, Figure 4.

Maintenance dominates the services market

The largest part of the services market is the maintenance of aircraft and their engines, Figure 5. In fact, the order should be reversed; engine maintenance is the dominant maintenance expense for the airlines.

A growing component of the Maintain market is the disassembly and recycling of older aircraft. Airbus is working to ease this process both in the design of the aircraft and the methods to do this cleanly and to reuse up to 90% of the materials in the used aircraft. It includes refurbished spare parts that go back to the market. Today’s reuse of scrapped airliners is around 70%.

The Train and Operate market is under heavy stress presently as many flight, cabin, and maintenance crew members left the industry during COVID, as did other ground support personnel.

The traffic has returned faster than predicted, with the summer of 2022 breaking the pre-pandemic level for weekly flights in Europe and CIS. Figure 6.

Over the 20 years, about 2m persons need to be trained for their roles in the air transport business, with almost 600,000 pilots needing training and certification as Air Transport Pilots, Figure 7. It creates a training market for 30,000 Air Transport Pilots (ATPL) per year.

In Train and Operate, the continuous improvement of the operation efficiency of airlines through smarter and more efficient flying shall gain us a further 5% reduction in CO2 emissions.

An important part of the Enhance business is the cabin refurbishments and upgrades during the 23 years of an aircraft’s life.

Examples of the types of services that will be demanded in 2041 are given in Figure 8. The 5,000+ maintenance inspections for the aircraft are only the heavy checks done about midlife for an airliner, also called D checks. The more frequent C checks, also hangar based, are not in these figures.

The 7,000+ engine checks are the workshop overhauls needed to restore the engines’ performance and replace life cycle limited parts (LLPs). The spare parts for these overhauls are the primary revenue stream in the maintenance business for the aircraft.

The airline is currently operating an all-Airbus fleet of 116 A320 Family aircraft.

Using the power of the Skywise aviation data platform, Skywise Health Monitoring collates and centralises maintenance warnings and alerts in real time. SHM can correlate alerts and indicate if they are related. With each event, a history of recent flights enables identification of repetitive incidents, and the system also provides a full view of related technical documentation. Monitoring in real time helps ground staff to make appropriate decisions based on criticality, logistics and upcoming maintenance checks, and, if necessary, prepare in advance forrepairs and replacements - all before the aircraft has even landed.

“By using SHM, Volaris will benefit from all the advantages the platform offers to optimise maintenance operations with a focus on unscheduled maintenance. Skywise Health Monitoring saves airlines time and decreases the cost of unscheduled maintenance thanks to data-driven decisions” said David Marty, Head of Airbus Digital Solutions Sales and Marketing.

In addition to these data-driven benefits, safety plays a key role, as it is our permanent and unwavering commitment in every operation

said Holger Blankenstein, executive Vice President of Volaris Airlines.

Joining the growing number of airlines entrusting their fleet monitoring to SHM, Volaris is the 70th Skywise Health Monitoring customer.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.996163010597229}",positive,0.996163010597229,1
"Air France, Airbus face trial in Paris over fatal 2009 Rio-Paris crash - FRANCE 24 English","Mon, 10 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi9mcmFuY2UvMjAyMjEwMTAtYWlyLWZyYW5jZS1haXJidXMtZmFjZS10cmlhbC1pbi1wYXJpcy1vdmVyLWZhdGFsLTIwMDktcmlvLXBhcmlzLWNyYXNo0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Determining responsibility

Air France and Airbus will face trial starting Monday in Paris, 13 years after the crash of an A330 shortly after takeoff from Rio de Janeiro that resulted in the deaths of 228 people. Civil parties hope to get answers from the two aviation giants, who both still deny responsibility for the disaster.

After more than 10 years of proceedings and a reversal of the court's decision to dismiss the case, Air France and Airbus will be tried on charges of ""involuntary manslaughter"". From Monday, the two aeronautical giants will appear before the Paris criminal court. They will face the families of the 228 passengers and crew members who died onboard flight AF447 from Rio de Janeiro to Paris when it crashed on June 1, 2009.

Civil parties, who have been caught up for a decade in a judicial labyrinth of expertise and counter-expertise reports requested by Airbus, have been long awaiting this extraordinary trial.

'What we are expecting is a battle of experts' 03:00

""We are both impatient and a little anxious for this trial to begin"", says Danièle Lamy, president of the association Entraide et Solidarité AF447, who lost her son in the tragedy. ""Even though this will plunge us back into an extremely painful moment, this trial is absolutely essential for honouring the memory of those lost and for the families,"" she added.

""The families of the victims want the company and the European manufacturer to be found guilty,"" says Sébastien Busy, a lawyer representing several civil parties. ""So far, no one has been found responsible, and the two parties involved consider that this accident was simply a series of unlucky mishaps.""

For the 476 civil parties, however, the tragedy that took place over the Atlantic was instead the result of a pattern of malfunctions, negligence and a wait-and-see approach on the part of Airbus and Air France.

'The trial of the dead'

The Bureau of Inquiry and Analysis (BEA), a French government agency responsible for investigating aviation accidents and incidents, conducted a series of investigations and in July 2012 established the series of human and technical failures that led to the crash.

On May 31, 2009, the Airbus A330 chartered by Air France took off from Rio de Janeiro en route to Paris. Upon leaving Brazil’s coastline the pilots encountered a frequent meteorological phenomenon known as the ""doldrums"", a thunderstorm area that causes severe turbulence and cold temperatures.

In these extreme conditions, frost formed on the Pitot probes, which are nickel tubes located at the front of the aircraft that continuously provide information regarding the aircraft's speed. As a result, the pilots received false data about the aircraft’s speed from the faulty probes and so believed that the aircraft was losing altitude.

Two years after the crash, the discovery of the aircraft’s black bloxes uncovered flight conversations that revealed a lack of understanding within the cockpit. At the time, the pilots had not received adequate training to deal with this kind of situation.

To regain altitude, they pulled back on the control column to pitch the plane up, which seemed to be the most logical thing do in the circumstances. The manoeuvre proved fatal, as the plane's nose was too high and its speed too low. The plane reached 38,000 feet, lost its lift in the air and fell like a stone. The ""STALL"" alarm sounded and in less than four minutes, the A330 had crashed into the Atlantic Ocean.

During the trial, Airbus is expected to insist once again that the crash was caused by pilot error so that it can absolve itself of any responsibility. ""The trial is being held for the dead, who cannot defend themselves,"" says Jean-Claude Guidicelli, who represents the father of Clara Amado, a flight attendant who died in the crash. ""But in the hierarchy of responsibility, there is first Airbus, which should have changed the Pitot probes.""

Airbus's wait-and-see attitude

""We see the main culprit as Airbus, which underestimated the risk linked to the probes freezing and did not take into account the incidents that had taken place in the year preceding the crash,"" said Busy. ""It seems that Airbus waited, hoping that nothing would happen.""

One year before the Rio-Paris crash, some 20 incidents linked to frozen probes had indeed been recorded and brought to the manufacturer’s attention. These occurrences were considered serious enough to push certain companies such as Air Caraïbes and XL Airways to replace the French-made Thalès probes with those made by US manufacturer Goodrich.

Why didn’t Air France do the same? According to the BEA, the airline company had expressed concern about these failures to Airbus.

""Air France wanted to keep Thalès because it is a French company,"" says Guidicelli, who believes that ""lives were sacrificed on the altar of money and business"". After the disaster, the model in question was replaced worldwide.

During the nine weeks of the trial, one question in particular will be brought up repeatedly: could this accident have been avoided? The civil parties are convinced that it could have: Airbus was blinded by an unbounded faith in the reliability of its A330, and Air France, for its part, should have better informed its crews about the incidents in which Pitot probes had malfunctioned.

But after 10 years of proceedings, some of the victims' families doubt that they will get the answers to the questions haunting them. ""We risk witnessing a new game of ping-pong between Air France and Airbus, who are blaming each other,"" says Guidicelli.

""Airbus would re-establish some honour for itself, were it to acknowledge its share of responsibility for the accident,"" said Danièle Lamy from the Entraide et Solidarité AF447 association.

If the court finds them liable, Air France and Airbus may have to pay fines of up to €225,000. The trial is due to end on December 8.

"Inside Airbus' new A350 NPS interior mockup, with ten-abreast seats - Runway Girl Network","Wed, 05 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvYWlyYnVzLW5ldy1hMzUwLW5wcy10ZW4tYWJyZWFzdC1zZWF0cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TOULOUSE — Following our in-depth interview last month with Airbus executives around the New Production Standard variant for the airframer’s A350 twinjet, Runway Girl Network’s journalists secured exclusive access to Airbus’ mockup centre, where the airframer’s A350 cabin — and external galley mockups — have the new NPS seat area with ten-abreast seating, galleys and lavatories on show. After spending about an hour with Airbus passenger experience executives within the mockups, on a no-photos basis, there is much to consider.

There is great news from the galley and lavatory perspective. The work that Airbus has done to add extra work and storage space is excellent, and both flight attendants and catering designers — from front to back of the aircraft — should be pleased.

The option for a larger lavatory ahead of door 1L, too, is good news for premium class passengers and, potentially, for wheelchair users and passengers with reduced mobility. This might even allow Airbus to offer a properly accessible lavatory. And an extra four inches of cabin width is a bonus for premium economy and business class too, although it was notable that no new seating options taking advantage of the NPS width were on show.

But clearly, the greatest interest in — and primary driver of — this NPS aircraft variant is the way that the resculpted sidewalls enable a slightly less uncomfortable experience in the ten-abreast 3-4-3 economy configuration, which was previously only taken up by budget carriers like French bee and Air Caraïbes.

At first glance, few outside the industry will notice much difference in the sidewalls. The frames are changed to an extent that only the most observant of experts would notice any difference apart from, as an option, the electrically dimmable windows. (These are fine: your author generally dislikes the idea because flight attendants have a disappointing tendency to slam them to full black when they want passengers to fall asleep and stop bothering them, but they do at least go very dark, and are easily swapped out if they fail.)

Overall, the cabin engineering is impressive, and the extra four inches will be welcome in economy, making the nine-abreast A350 economy experience even better.

But it’s the 3-4-3 that’s driving this, not a more comfortable experience in 3-3-3. Airbus has designed and managed this in a way that makes the budget airline experience better, though ten-abreast on an A350 still cannot be said to be a product that is suitable for a full-service carrier at full-service pricing.

In seat terms, Airbus has a half dozen economy options in the mockup including fully featured products from the usual seatmaker suspects, and comfort levels varied between them in the way that we would expect: the more fully featured seats with advanced kinematics and shin space sculpting were unsurprisingly much more comfortable than the more basic products without these engineered benefits.

Within the cabin, and with the proviso that we are talking 1-2 rows of each seat vendor’s product with gaps — so the cabin inherently appeared a little odd — the rows of seats looked surprisingly normal, more so than expected.

We do note, with some interest, that not one single row of nine-abreast seating was installed on the aircraft, so direct comparisons were not available — neither to us nor to airline executives viewing the new seats.

Airbus has indeed managed to eke out 17” of seat width between the armrests. Yes, the armrests are thin, but the airframer has clearly learned from the nonsense proposals of the ridiculously narrow armrests on the proposed eleven-abreast A380 cabin. These can’t exactly be called generous, but they look within proportion for a 2020s-era seat. This is itself impressive.

The aisles are not nonsensically narrow, even for wider passengers. But the cabin is very tight at the shoulder level by the windows, particularly where there is sidewall sticking out rather than the gap for the window. Passengers broader at the shoulders are likely to feel very hemmed in, especially at the window seats, and even more so where their shoulders do not line up with an actual window.

Airlines might well consider taking the weight and complexity penalty of movable armrests on the window side of the triples — which, on the plus side would come with a reduced part count — to allow for a small amount of extra comfort.

The biggest problem beyond pure seat width comes at foot level, and largely for people with bigger feet. With the window seat passenger markedly closer to the window, much of their foot space is taken up by the structure of the leg. We would estimate that approximately one third of the seat’s legroom is affected in this way. It’s not quite the extent that the A380 eleven-abreast seat was, but it is still problematic and will be unacceptable to some passengers.

At the behest of airlines that do not want to have to work with two different sets of seat track positions on the A350, Airbus has not changed them to allow for one foot to be placed either side of the seat triple’s leg structure. Both RGN’s journalists’ feet size out at an EU 48 (UK 13, US 14), so on the higher end, and we could not fit our feet between the sidewall and the seat leg at all. An Airbus executive suggested — and indeed demonstrated — that her smaller feet did indeed fit, wiggled in, side-on. She also suggested that, during testing, some shorter passengers appreciated being able to put their foot up on the angled rising leg structure. This seemed very optimistic.

Overall, the ten-abreast option is not precisely good news for passengers, because adding an extra person in every row makes it tight indeed. But seatmakers in particular have made advances in the modern cabin since, say, the introduction of ten-abreast seating on the Boeing 777 or even nine-abreast seating on the Boeing 787. In overall comfort terms, the feel was similar to a first-generation 3-4-3 Boeing 777 from 20–30 years ago.

While the seats are definitely narrower and less comfortable in ten-abreast than in nine-abreast, Airbus has done a decent job in minimising the tradeoffs and still producing a cabin that is tight but manageable and secures an extra seat in every row. An 11% seat count bonus is nothing to sniff at, even if the environmental arguments Airbus tries to make for the move seem very questionable post facto justifications verging on greenwashing.

The key contextual question is what Boeing has managed to do with the widened cabin of the much-delayed 777X. The American airframer has 24cm more width to the 777 than the A350, which works out at just under an inch per passenger in ten-abreast. If Boeing can raise the 3-4-3 experience of the 777-300ER generation, the difference between it and the A350 NPS starts to widen.

RGN understands that the first aircraft to be delivered with the NPS specification is either going to be or has very recently been to Spanish carrier Iberia, in the nine-abreast configuration in economy. Iberia did not immediately respond to requests for information about this cabin or its layout.

Second batch of Airbus' Sparkwing solar panels selected by Aerospacelab to accommodate serial production of satellites - Airbus,"Wed, 12 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTEwLXNlY29uZC1iYXRjaC1vZi1haXJidXMtc3Bhcmt3aW5nLXNvbGFyLXBhbmVscy1zZWxlY3RlZC1ieS1hZXJvc3BhY2VsYWItdG_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An additional six of Airbus’ Sparkwing solar panels have been selected by Aerospacelab to accommodate their ramp up towards higher satellite production volumes. The panels are designed and produced at Airbus’ Dutch site in Leiden. The ordered configuration, consisting of two single panel wings, each measuring 1070x570mm, is identical to the set recently delivered by Airbus for the first flight model of Aerospacelab’s Very High Resolution (VHR) mission.

The stiffness of the solar panels concept for small satellites is key for Aerospacelab’s VHR mission, which requires high agility and stability of the platform as it allows for better quality pictures in quicker succession. This feature is brought in by an intelligently designed hinge that provides a high stiffness design out of a very small volume. Further, the minimal integration effort needed for the solar panels is an asset in the satellite’s assembly and integration flow, especially during the envisaged production ramp up at the megafactory that Aerospacelab opened in Belgium this summer.

Rob Postma, Chief Executive Office of Airbus Defence and Space Netherlands: “We are happy to see the first customer of this product coming back for a follow-on order. It confirms that the delivery of our initial flight model has been well received. We see that our catalogue approach for small satellites, strong supply chain support and short through-put times, lower the risks for our customer and produce a reliable solution. It proves that our fully qualified product can deliver on its promise of “Space made easy”. We look forward to extending our good relationship with Aerospacelab for a continued collaboration.”

Established in Belgium, Switzerland and France, Aerospacelab is a fast-growing company created in 2018, counting more than 140 full time employees. With a unique vertically integrated approach, Aerospacelab is specialized in satellite platforms and geospatial intelligence. It designs, manufactures, and operates constellations of remote sensing satellites, empowering intelligence and insights by its proprietary satellite data.

“The smartly designed solar panel concept supports Aerospacelab in accomplishing the manufacturing of affordable and high-performance satellites. The pragmatic approach was in line with our serial production objectives, so we are very grateful to be able to have Sparkwing for the next six flight sets,” said Benoit Deper, Aerospacelab founder and CEO. “We have been impressed by Airbus’ ability to produce commercially available, off-the-shelf solar array for LEO small satellites, and are looking forward to a fruitful relationship.”

Sparkwing is the world’s first commercially available, off-the-shelf solar array for small satellites. It is optimised for Low Earth Orbit missions that require power levels between 100W and 2000W. It offers customers a choice of more than thirty different panel dimensions, configurable into deployable wings with one, two or three panels per wing.

Next to power generation, the solar array product provides a high stiffness, single actuation need (due to only one hold-down per wing), minimal integration effort (made for integration by the customer) and gentle demands on the spacecraft sidewall tolerances. Sparkwing is a product developed by Airbus Defence and Space Netherlands B.V., with the support of the Netherlands Space Office and ESA.

Airbus Prepares Market For Launch Of More Freighter Variants - Aviation Week,"Thu, 06 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L2FpcmxpbmVzLWxlc3NvcnMvYWlyYnVzLXByZXBhcmVzLW1hcmtldC1sYXVuY2gtbW9yZS1mcmVpZ2h0ZXItdmFyaWFudHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The location was carefully selected. An event attended by more senior-level people buying aircraft is hard to conceive.

That was the scene at the end of September in Marrakech, Morrocco, where lessors and the aircraft finance community at large gathered for the International Society of Transport Aircraft Trading (ISTAT) conference. And Airbus had something to say about freighters: They are not only on the radar but very much in focus.

Airbus is moving closer to launching A330neo, A321neo freighter versions

CEO Guillaume Faury points to strong demand

Manufacturer is committed to gaining higher cargo market share

“We are looking at new-build A321neo and A330neo freighters,” Paul Meijers, Airbus senior vice president of sales and marketing, told attendees at the ISTAT Europe, Middle East and Africa conference on Sept. 19.

Airbus has not been competitive in the new-build freighter market for some time, leaving the segment essentially to Boeing and the 767F and 777F. Last year, Airbus launched the A350F and has had some considerable early sales success. “We want a much larger share of that market,” Meijers said. “We will address that market in a much stronger way.” He added that the A350F was “just the start.”

As it turned out, Meijers was laying the groundwork for his boss, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury. A couple of weeks later, Faury told analysts at the company’s Capital Market Day—held for the first time since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic—that freighter versions of the A330neo and A321neo were in high demand. Therefore, developing cargo versions of the aircraft made a lot of sense.

Neither Faury nor Meijers indicated when Airbus may be ready to launch more new-build freighters. But unlike Boeing, the company is under no pressure to replace its current single-aisle passenger aircraft family anytime soon, so Airbus can afford to dedicate most of its research and development spending on the ZEROe hydrogen aircraft project slated for entry into service in 2035. There are only two major derivative programs Airbus is working on in the near term: the A321XLR and the A350F, which are due to arrive in 2024 and 2025, respectively.

Talk of A330neo and A321neo freighter versions is not new, and A321 classic passenger-to-freighter conversions are available as well. Airbus apparently has been discussing the A330neo cargo variant with express freight carriers such as UPS, whereas AirAsia has hinted at being interested in operating a potential cargo version of the A321neo on intra-Asia routes. The airline said last year that it would consider converting a part of its existing order for passenger aircraft to a cargo model.

With just 38 aircraft sold, the first-generation A330 freighter was not a commercial success. However, a cargo aircraft based on the A330neo would almost certainly offer better range and economics. Also, the cargo market has strengthened substantially, with e-commerce driving a lot of the growth, a segment for which an aircraft the size of the A330neo could work well.

Another factor in Airbus’ strategy is that Boeing cannot produce the 777F and 767F beyond 2027 because of International Civil Aviation Organization emissions regulations. While the 777-8F will succeed the 777F, Boeing does not yet have a successor for the 767F. Boeing President and CEO Dave Calhoun recently described a 787F as the most likely replacement option but indicated that Boeing will not launch such a program quickly.

Airbus officially started the A350F in 2021 and gave itself four years until first delivery in 2025. Depending on the extent of changes required, derivatives of the A321neo and A330neo could take a similar amount of time to develop. On the A321neo side, the situation is more complex because of the passenger version’s current ramp-up challenges—the aircraft is much more difficult to build than the A320neo. The A330neo is being produced at low rates of less than two aircraft per month. Airbus has delivered just 13 since the start of the year. A freighter version could help boost production rates.

But whether the air cargo boom will continue is another question. Geoff Kehr, senior vice president of global air fleet management at DHL, expressed “cautious optimism” about demand and told attendees at the ISTAT conference that he is “not concerned that things are falling apart.”

Guy See, Fedex’s managing director of aircraft acquisitions and sales, said the company is seeing “some impact” on business from factors like high inflation and interest rates or the Russia-Ukraine War. “Customers are not spending as much. The lower volumes are hopefully a short-term issue,” See said. Fedex said Sept. 15 that business conditions will “further weaken” in the fourth quarter.

For Airbus, the big question is whether air freight will continue to be a larger part of the business than it has historically been. Faury’s answer appears to be a clear “yes.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9976726174354553}",positive,0.9976726174354553,1

""We are very proud to announce the establishment of our state-of-the-art testbed in the US, especially significant news, given the announcement of the Nobel Prize for the elegant physics enabling quantum communication. This testbed will open the door for customers in financial services, critical infrastructure, and telecom to test our technologies in the New York metropolitan area,"" explains CEO Dr. Noel Goddard. ""This project allows us to showcase our first-of-their-kind quantum memory and entanglement sources, as well as our quantum network support hardware for precise timing and qubit stabilization. On this journey, we are thrilled to have the support of Airbus Ventures, a leading quantum investor who shares our vision of developing quantum technologies to lead the next wave of ultra-secure communications.""

Qunnect's products, including an entangled photon source with unrivaled compatibility to atomic-based devices and a high fidelity quantum memory, are key enablers for applications in quantum sensing and computing. Qunnect's true value will be in the integration of these technologies, into a holistic suite to realize long distance quantum communication protocols. These protocols eliminate the vulnerabilities of first-generation Quantum Key Distribution systems, which are fundamentally limited in distance and require relay nodes to scale, resulting in security risks.

""At Airbus Ventures, we are particularly interested in investing in enabling technologies that make quantum practically usable, out of the lab environment and into the real world, where these portfolio companies can aid in tangibly addressing major security challenges being faced today,"" notes Airbus Ventures Partner Nicole Conner. ""We were immediately drawn to Noel and her leadership, quickly paving the way as the leading voice in quantum internet technology, and we are confident that the team's breakthrough testbed at Brooklyn Navy Yard is just the beginning of a sequence of transformative work. We are proud to back such an exceptional team and to be joined by such an incredible investor syndicate.""

The majority of quantum networking technologies seen in the research community require extreme cooling and/or high vacuum support infrastructure. In contrast, Qunnect's first-in-class solutions support real-world deployment and scalability, designed to be operational at room temperature - rather than fragile, climate-controlled laboratory settings.

""We have spent the last several years tailoring every one of our quantum devices to meet the requirements of large-scale, telecom-integrated quantum networking. Now that we have the team and the support, with special thanks to the Airbus Ventures team, we are now ready to start our next phase with a concentrated focus on scalability and field-deployment,"" remarks Mehdi Namazi, Qunnect Co-Founder and CSO.

In September 2021, the company commercialized the world's first Quantum Memory, a critical component in enabling long-distance quantum-secure communication protocols. Building on this achievement, once its first generation product suite is complete in mid-2023, Qunnect will be poised to provide the first distributed entanglement network on the commercial market.

Saving lives with the five-bladed H145 in New Zealand - Airbus,"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTEwLXNhdmluZy1saXZlcy13aXRoLXRoZS1maXZlLWJsYWRlZC1oMTQ1LWluLW5ldy16ZWFsYW5k0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It was a windy night on the south island of New Zealand - Duncan Gourley was on duty for the operator Heli Otago. “We had a primary mission to fly from Taieri Airport to Stewart Island to pick up a patient who was suffering from a heart attack, and then transfer him to Dunedin Hospital. ” With changing weather, gusts up to 75 kts and low temperatures, the conditions were challenging for the team, forcing them to use low level IFR routes and a GPS-led approach into Stewart Island. “The mission took more than three hours, due to the weather. In the end, we managed to stabilise the patient in the helicopter with advanced life-saving care, and were able to transfer him to the hospital, where they continued treatment. It was thanks to the H145 that we managed it; with a less capable system, I’m sure we would have been forced to abort.” Gourley adds: “The H145 is the most capable helicopter I’ve ever flown, and the five-bladed version is the smoothest. The Helionix system coupled with the airframe design of the H145 offers great peace of mind especially when operating under IFR conditions. ”

Dream destination but challenging conditions



New Zealand, with its otherworldly landscapes, green vallies and white beaches is a dream destination for thousands of visitors from around the world. But when it comes to flying helicopters, it has its fair share of challenges, especially when the missions include Helicopter Emergency Medical Services. “New Zealand is made up of very changeable topography and weather, with mountains to the west that climb up to 12,000 ft (more than 3,500 metres) and very low freezing levels making for challenging conditions”, says Duncan Gourley, Pilot at Heli Otago with more than 4,500 flight hours on the H145 family of helicopters. “We also fly at night, 24/7, at any time of the year. For this, we operate our helicopters in a mixture of visual flight rules and instrument flight rules (IFR)/performance-based navigation (PBN), depending on the conditions we face.”

Performance-based navigation allows the operator to fly the aircraft along a precise flight path with a high level of accuracy and ability to determine the aircraft’s position. When low-level IFR routes exist and the helicopters are suitably equipped and certified, operators can keep their helicopters in lower, warmer air, which reduces encounters with icing conditions. “On top of that, we rely on night vision goggles, which are an essential tool for us since we operate day and night, often in unknown areas”, Gourley adds.

Heli Otago: More than 30 years of experience operating helicopters



Heli Otago has been operating in the Otago and Southland regions of New Zealand since 1990 and is one of the biggest helicopter operators in the country. For its missions, which ranges from air charters, agricultural missions to training and air ambulance operations, the company relies on a fleet of more than 15 helicopters. Since 1998, Heli Otago has been successfully operating the Air Ambulance and Rescue Helicopter service for the lower South Island. The HEMS operations are always on standby, ready to respond to serious accidents, medical emergencies, search and rescue missions or inter-hospital transfers, providing paramedic care for a range of over 66,500 square kilometres. For these missions, Heli Otago has a fleet of BK117 helicopters, and since 2017 an EC145. In 2019 the operator added a four-bladed H145, which has clocked in more than 3,200 flight hours in just over three years, with an availability well above 90%. And now, they have added the five-bladed H145.

Five-bladed H145: A real game changer



“It was an easy decision to choose the five-bladed H145 as our latest helicopter: the transition is pretty easy from our other H145 family of helicopters; the single-engine performance and the overall performance of the helicopter is fantastic for the safety of our operations. The autopilot and the Helionix system of the five-bladed H145 have proven to be a real game changer, especially for our IFR/PBN missions”, says Graeme Gale, Owner and Pilot at Helicopters Otago Ltd.

The maintenance plan for the new H145 is also facilitated for the operator, reducing the need for technical interventions and costly repairs. “The new rotor system requires less maintenance due to the modern design incorporating elastomeric bearings and composite materials. Less vibration should decrease long-term maintenance and repair costs due to less fatigue on the airframe and components. And the increase in useful load means we can carry larger payloads or carry more fuel, increasing the efficiency of our operations.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9900853633880615}",neutral,0.9900853633880615,0

DALLAS – Airbus has announced its adjusted earnings for the third quarter of 2022, increasing profits to €599m (US$596m). For the first nine months of the year, revenues had also increased by 5% to €2.87bn (US$2.85bn).

Revenues for its commercial aircraft business also rose 8% to €26.6bn (US$26.4bn) for the first nine months of 2022.

Airbus said this was mainly due to “the higher number of deliveries including a favorable mix and the strengthening of the US dollar.”

Supply Chain Fragility

Guillaume Faury, Airbus CEO, said, “Airbus delivered a solid nine-month 2022 financial performance in a complex operating environment. The supply chain remains fragile resulting from the cumulative impact of COVID, the war in Ukraine, energy supply issues and constrained labour markets.”

The CEO added, “Our strong focus on cash flow and the favourable dollar/euro environment have enabled us to raise our free cash flow guidance for 2022. The commercial aircraft delivery and earnings targets are maintained. Our teams are focused on our key priorities and in particular, delivering the commercial aircraft ramp-up over the coming months and years.”

Its gross commercial aircraft orders increased to 856 this year, with net orders of 647 after cancellations. The European manufacturer now has an order backlog of 7,294 commercial aircraft at the end of September 2022.

A321XLR Entry into Service Update

Meanwhile, Mr. Faury has also given an update on the expected entry into service (EIS) of its A321XLR. Airbus had hoped that the airliner would enter service in 2023. In May, it was announced that this would be pushed back to early 2024.

Three prototypes are now taking part in the test certification program. However, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has asked Airbus to look at potential fire risks posed by the aircraft’s additional fuel tank, delaying the EIS to the second quarter of 2024

The manufacturer also added that its A320neo family production rate is on track to meet its target of 65 aircraft per month by early 2024, rising to 75 in 2025. In the statement, Airbus said, “The groundwork continues throughout all sites to secure rate 75 and adapt to the higher proportion of A321s in the backlog, ensuring all A320 Family Final Assembly Lines become A321 capable.”

DALLAS – Something big has landed at Orlando Sanford International Airport (SFB)—the Airbus BelugaST, one of the world’s largest transport aircraft.

The aircraft is scheduled to arrive at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) early tomorrow morning to deliver an Airbus-built satellite that is part of a key forthcoming space mission.

This is a momentous event for Airbus as it is the first time the Beluga has returned to the US and the KSC in 14 years. In addition, as the Beluga arrives, another Airbus-built satellite will sit atop a rocket set to launch from KSC at midnight today.

BelugaST Operations

The Airbus Beluga fleet has been operating successfully for more than 20 years. The type was exclusively dedicated to the transport of structures for Airbus aircraft.

Then, in December 2021, Airbus launched its cargo division using its A300-600ST fleet, with its own Air Operator Certificate (AOC) and personnel, to offer a solution to outsized freight transportation services worldwide.

The launch of the general oversized air freight service took place during the last week of the year, when Beluga “No. 3” delivered a new helicopter from Airbus Helicopters’ manufacturing site in Marignane, France, halfway across the world to Kobe in Japan.

Along the way, the Beluga stopped to refuel at various transit points – including Warsaw (in Poland), Novosibirsk (in Russia), and Seoul (in Korea). Notably, the whole helicopter could be accommodated inside the Beluga without any prior disassembly — only needing its long rotor blades to be folded back.

At the end of July, Brazil received for the first time the Airbus A300-600ST as it performed its first cargo operation to the region transporting three helicopters.

Florida Touchdown

Orlando Sanford International Airport was built as Naval Air Station Sanford, a Master Jet Base for carrier-based attack and reconnaissance aircraft, and was used by the U.S. Navy until 1969. The distance between SFB and KSC is 39 miles.

Airways will cover a press conference that will be held Monday at 7 a.m. EST to learn more about the satellite mission and Beluga transport from Airbus executives.

If you’re in the Orlando area, grab your cameras and shoot some images of the BelugaST at SFB or tomorrow at KSC and share them with us on our social media channels, and we will update Monday’s coverage with the best shots!

Weather monitoring counts on a powerful new tool - Airbus,"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTEwLXdlYXRoZXItbW9uaXRvcmluZy1jb3VudHMtb24tYS1wb3dlcmZ1bC1uZXctdG9vbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse, 25 October 2022 - Four times more precise than its predecessor, IASI-NG will provide vital data for weather forecasting, pollution monitoring and climate research. A true partnership between Airbus and French Space Agency CNES, the Airbus team has just integrated the first IASI-NG flight optical instrument onto the MetOp-SG weather satellite ‘A’ that will carry it into space.

The most complex of the satellite’s instruments, IASI-NG is the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer: it will determine temperature and water vapour profiles in the atmosphere, record ocean surface and land temperatures and monitor a wide range of chemical compounds and other key variables for climate research, including greenhouse gases, desert dust and cloud cover. Two other IASI-NG instruments will later equip the two next MetOp-SG satellites A to cover more than 20 years of weather and environment monitoring.

“At Airbus, we constantly aim at providing the best technological solutions to scientists around the world to better understand the processes that determine the planet’s climate,” said Philippe Pham, Head of Earth Observation and Science at Airbus. “IASI-NG will be a key instrument for weather forecasting and to monitor the climate’s health at any moment in time to secure life and property on Earth.”

Why do we need IASI-NG?

IASI-NG's ability to detect and accurately measure the levels and circulation patterns of gases that are known to influence the climate will be invaluable to scientists. In parallel, this Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer will measure atmospheric temperature and moisture, and trace gases such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, methane and ozone, giving a full picture of the atmosphere’s characteristics at any given time.

Picture

How does it work?

IASI-NG is a state-of-the-art, sophisticated sounding instrument that will be used for global measurements of atmospheric temperature and moisture with unprecedented accuracy and spectral resolution to improve weather prediction. The optical interferometry process offers fine spectral samplings of the atmosphere in the infrared band between the wavelengths of 3.2 and 15.5 microns. This enables the instrument to establish temperature and water vapour profiles in the troposphere and the lower stratosphere, as well as measure concentrations of ozone, carbon monoxide, methane and other compounds. The instrument should provide nearly an order of magnitude improvement in the vertical resolution of temperature and humidity profiles in the atmosphere, which will result in significant improvements in weather forecasts. Twenty years of invaluable climate data MetOp-SG is a continuation of the successful MetOp first generation series of satellites, which currently provide critical meteorological observations from polar orbit. These valuable contributions will be enhanced and provided by the MetOp-SG satellites from mid-2020 up to the 2040s. MetOp-SG consists of two, parallel series of satellites (A and B), with three in each series. The A series, being built at Airbus in Toulouse, carries atmospheric sounders and optical/infrared imagers, while the B series, under construction at Airbus in Friedrichshafen in southern Germany, focuses on microwaves. MetOp-SG is a cooperative undertaking between the European Space Agency (ESA) and EUMETSAT, the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites. The first launch of the MetOp-SG mission is scheduled for 2025 after completion of integration and satellite level testing. The nominal operational lifetime of each MetOp-SG satellite is 7.5 years, ensuring full operational coverage over a 21-year period. IASI-NG integration operations - Copyright Airbus

This pioneer project, led by France, is key to modernising domestic security forces. More than ever, this contract reinforces Airbus’ position as European leader of critical communications, as well as that of Capgemini as trusted partner in the modernisation of emergency rescue and security forces, and provision of sovereign services.

The Réseau Radio du Futur will be a national, secure and high-speed (4G and 5G) priority mobile communication system, with a high level of resilience in order to guarantee the continuum of security and emergency rescue missions on a daily basis, including in the event of a crisis or major event. RRF intends to equip up to 400,000 users in the security and emergency rescue forces, such as the national gendarmerie, the national police force, firefighters and other civil security forces.

It will allow these users to benefit from many new data-centred services, such as video, in particular.

In the context of RRF, Airbus will, through its activity, to provide a solution that will allow its various stakeholders to communicate via this new network, with support from a variety of partners, including Econocom, Prescom, Samsung and Streamwide. For its part, Capgemini will integrate the many sets of expertise provided by all the project partners. This includes Dell Technologies for the cloud infrastructure it will provide, in support Ericsson’s 5G telecommunications services.

Tamarack Eyes Airbus A320s For Active Winglet Upgrade - Aviation Week,"Wed, 19 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9zaG93bmV3cy9uYmFhL3RhbWFyYWNrLWV5ZXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzMjBzLWFjdGl2ZS13aW5nbGV0LXVwZ3JhZGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ORLANDO—Active winglet manufacturer Tamarack Aerospace Group says it is assembling a “coalition” of airlines and maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) operators to help offer its technology for retrofit of Airbus A320 narrowbody airliners.

Speaking with reporters Oct. 17 at the NBAA Business Aviation Convention & Exhibition (NBAA-BACE), Tamarack founder and CEO Nick Guida said his company has placed fuel-saving winglet extensions on nearly 10% of Cessna Citation-series business jets, positioning it to target a $10 billion addressable market for A320s.

“We’re going after the A320,” Guida said. “Now that we have 170 aircraft flying and we’re creeping up on 10% of the addressable fleet of Citations, it’s hard to discount us.”

Tamarack led off its press conference by announcing a memorandum of understanding with hybrid-electric aircraft developer Ampaire to provide its winglets for Ampaire’s Eco Caravan, Eco Otter and Eco King Air conversions. The companies said joint development work has already begun.

Tamarack also reported being in active talks with three presales purchasers of Beechcraft King Air 200 and 300 turboprops slated for its Smartwing upgrade. In September, the Sandpoint, Idaho-based company announced the first active winglet retrofit of Textron Aviation’s Citation M2 Gen2.

Active winglets dynamically respond to changing loads and conditions, optimizing an aircraft’s aerodynamic efficiency by increasing lift and reducing drag. The modification reduces fuel burn and associated CO 2 emissions. Tamarack says the efficiency gains are three or four times that of passive winglets.

Guida said A320-family and Boeing 737 narrowbody airliners are responsible for most of aviation’s CO 2 emissions, presenting the company with an opportunity to offer active winglets for sustainability objectives. Tamarack in past years has held discussions with Airbus about the winglet upgrade, he said, but “couldn’t get past” an intellectual property issue with its patented technology.

Tamarack envisions a 2.5-year process to certify the modification on A320s, an effort that Guida compared to Aviation Partners’ Blended Winglet adaptation of Boeing Business Jets. “Our team is not worried about upsetting Airbus; we’re just worried about getting a plane in the air,” he said. “We’re just following the same path that Aviation Partners did.”

The coalition of airlines and MROs Tamarack is assembling will have “big names that derisk this whole thing for everyone,” and provide both capital investment and in-kind services, Guida said. “We have 32 people at Sandpoint; we can’t do it ourselves.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999297857284546}",neutral,0.9999297857284546,0

The Airbus A300-600ST (Super Transporter), or Beluga, made its first flight in 1994. According to Airbus, it measures 184 feet (56 meters) in length and has a wingspan of 147 feet (44.8 m). The massive cargo jet can carry payloads weighing up to 44 tons (40 tonnes) and measuring 22 by 23 by 127 feet (6.7 by 7.1 by 39 m). The cargo area even features a special heating module that can be used when sensitive payloads that require climate controls are being transported, ensuring they aren't damaged in flight. Only five Belugas have been built to date.

The Airbus A300 In-Service Fleet By The Numbers - Aviation Week,"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L2FpcmxpbmVzLWxlc3NvcnMvYWlyYnVzLWEzMDAtc2VydmljZS1mbGVldC1udW1iZXJz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tracking in-service aircraft and fleet types is usually not difficult using databases such as Aviation Week’s Fleet Discovery. But digging out the details of the Airbus A300 in-service fleet 50 years after its first flight is complicated, and results have to be taken with some caution. Information about whether an aircraft is still flying often varies from source to source. And with a significant part of the fleet operating in Iran and Russia, even Airbus has only limited access to information, given that the sanctions imposed on those countries essentially allow no dealings with the operators there.

According to Airbus’ latest operational statistics for September, a total of 229 A300s remain in operation worldwide. Fleet Discovery allows a more detailed look at the actual status of the aircraft: it lists 182 as in service, 24 in parked or parked-reserve status and 23 more in long-term storage. Fifty-four A310s are still flying, Airbus says. Of the A300s, the vast majority are freighters.

FedEx is by some margin the largest remaining operator of the type, with 70 of the aircraft. It is followed by UPS with 52 and European Air Transport (operating on behalf of DHL) with 22. Because Iranian airlines in general have been all but unable to modernize their fleets, they have been forced to stick with their aircraft much longer. That has led to Iran becoming home to the largest A300 passenger aircraft fleet, with 21 still flying in the country, according to Airbus.

There are 38 remaining operators of the A300, and the in-service fleet is 28 years old on average. An A300 typically flies about 500 cycles or 878 hr. per year, reflecting its roles at FedEx and UPS: domestic cargo flights averaging just under 2 hr. and no more than 2-3 sectors per day. There are no extended-range twin-engine operations performance standards flights anymore.

Airbus figures show that MSN 80, registered as EP-IBS, is the oldest active A300. The aircraft is one of only two A300B2s still shown as in service. However, according to Aviation Week’s Tracked Aircraft Utilization tool, MSN 80 has not flown since December 2020. MSN 141, an A300B4 owned by Galaxy Aviation, is the second-oldest, having been delivered in 1981 (initially to Thai Airways).

The last A300 built is MSN 878, delivered to FedEx in July of 2007. Since then, the aircraft has flown 11,507 cycles and 20,364 hr. Forty-four aircraft are younger than 20 years; another 121 are between 20 and 30 years old.

Some of the early aircraft are slowly reaching the end of their service lives. The A300B4 was initially designed for 34,000 cycles and 70,000 hr.; Airbus later introduced an extended service goal of 57,000 cycles and 118,000 hr. The A300-600’s design service goal (SDG) was 30,000 cycles and 67,500 hr., but the manufacturer extended its limit twice. It is now at 51,000 cycles and 89,000 hr. The company has no plans to extend A300-600’s SDG again, given the limited number of aircraft affected. The large operators, in particular FedEx and UPS, have relatively young fleets and are generally far from reaching the cycle or hourly limits of their aircraft.

In fact, UPS is making substantial investments in its A300 fleet. The airline launched a major cockpit upgrade program in 2015 that included new screens, a flight management system and weather radar, as well as an enhanced ground-proximity warning system and other changes. The majority of the fleet has been retrofitted by now, but the program is still ongoing.

At Airbus, the A300 (and A310) fleets are being managed by the out-of-production organization that is also handling the A380. They do not manage the A340, since it is seen as a sister program to the A330, which is still being built. Pascal Vialleton, the A300 head of program and chief engineer who also runs the technical directorate, says no new maintenance or in-service issues have surfaced for some time as the program is “very mature.” But ensuring spares availability has become a challenge. When manufacturing of a specific part has to be relaunched, the directorate turns the initial design drawings into digital 3D models as it retro-engineers the parts.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999977350234985}",neutral,0.9999977350234985,0

Brazilian divers recover part of the rudder of Flight AF 447 after it slammed into the Atlantic Ocean on June 1, 2009.

Victims' families and some aviation experts say the pilots were insufficiently trained to handle a loss of speed readings caused by crucial equipment freezing over in a storm.

Flight AF 447 from Rio de Janeiro plunged into the Atlantic Ocean in the early hours of June 1, 2009, after entering a zone near the Equator known for strong turbulence.

The Airbus A330 was carrying 12 crew members and 216 passengers. It was the carrier's deadliest crash.

It took nearly two years to locate the bulk of the fuselage and recover the ""black box"" flight recorders.

Air France and Airbus were charged as the inquiry progressed, with experts determining the crash resulted from mistakes made by pilots disorientated by so-called Pitot speed-monitoring tubes that had frozen over in thick cloud.

But investigating magistrates overseeing the case dropped the charges in 2019, a decision that infuriated victims' families.

Prosecutors appealed the decision and in 2021 a Paris court ruled there was sufficient evidence for a trial to go ahead.

Ophelie Toulliou, who lost her brother on the flight, said it was essential ""the truth come out, and that the sentences, if deserved, are handed down"".

""But the message is also to make companies that think they're untouchable understand: 'You're like everyone else and if you make mistakes, they will be punished,"" she told AFP.

'Lost our speeds'

The court will hear testimony from dozens of aviation experts and pilots over two months of hearings, and each company faces a maximum fine of 225,000 euros ($220,000).

There will also be analysis of the final minutes in the cockpit before the plane went into free-fall after entering a so-called ""intertropical convergence zone"" that often produces volatile storms with heavy precipitation.

In the cold, the Pitot tubes froze, a problem that had already been reported by other pilots – and which were quickly replaced on planes worldwide in the months after the accident.

""We've lost our speeds,"" one pilot is heard saying in the flight recordings, before other indicators mistakenly show a loss of altitude, and a series of alarm messages appear on the cockpit screens.

The pilots start climbing and even though a ""STALL"" alert sounds, reach 11,600 metres (38,060 feet).

""I don't know what's happening,"" one of the pilots is heard saying as the stall begins.

Training overhaul

The crash prompted an overhaul of training protocols across the industry, in particular to prepare pilots to handle the intense stress of unforeseen circumstances.

Pilots are also now required to continually practice stall responses on simulators.

""That was the big change after this accident for all civil airline companies. Before, it was something pilots learned in basic training and then they were never trained again,"" one airline executive told AFP, on condition of anonymity.

Testimony will also be heard from some of the 476 members of victims' families who are civil plaintiffs in the case.

But Nelson Faria Marinho, president of the Brazilian association of victims' relatives, said, ""I'm not expecting anything from this trial.""

""Even if there is a conviction, who will be punished? The CEOs? They were changed at Airbus and Air France a long time ago,"" he told AFP during an interview at his Rio home.

He will be represented by former French pilot Gerard Arnoux, who has advised several of the victims' families and wrote a book titled ""Rio-Paris Is Not Responding: AF447, the Crash that Should Not Have Happened"".

Croatia Airlines Looks to Buy Six New Airbus A220 - Airways Magazine,"Tue, 04 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vYWlyd2F5c21hZy5jb20vY3JvYXRpYS1haXJsaW5lcy1haXJidXMtYTIyMC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Croatia Airlines Looks to Buy Six New Airbus A220

DALLAS – Airbus is close to securing a new order for their latest adopted family of aircraft, as Croatia Airlines (OU) signals its interest in adding six Airbus A220 aircraft to their existing order for the A320neo family. If the deal is done, the aircraft would be delivered in 2026 and configured in a 127-passenger two-class configuration.

In a press release, OU’s management department stated that “when making the decision, special attention was paid to trends in the highly competitive aviation market, fuel prices and CO2 emissions, the goals of the European Union’s green policies, and the demands of our passengers.”

This change in plans by OU comes as a surprise, as the Balkan airline was in talks with Embraer to agree on a new order for a considerable number of E2 family aircraft, which were meant to replace its aging fleet of Q-400 and A320 aircraft.

The CEO of Embraer, Arjan Meijer, was certain that their offer was “hard to refuse,” as their aircraft “would generate a significantly higher operating profit in Croatia Airlines’ network due to its significantly smaller cost base.”

As the years go by, the Airbus A220 is gaining more market share in regional aviation, slowly driving out of business other manufacturers such as Bombardier or Sukhoi. Photo: Airbus

A New Battle Won by Airbus

Once again, the Airbus A220 wins in a commercial battle for an order, this time beating surprisingly Embraer’s offer, which has been leading regional aviation for more than 30 years on its own, but that is nowadays seeing more challenges presented by its competitors like Airbus.

The European manufacturer is earning tremendous success with the purchase of the CSeries program from Bombardier, which needed to be rescued by a big company after suffering serious economic problems due to delays and legal issues with airlines such as Delta Air Lines.

However, this does not mean that the Airbus A220 isn’t a good aircraft. Nonetheless, the new “baby bus” is proving to be a very profitable aircraft thanks to its fuel efficiency, innovation, and versatility, having secured more than 760 orders since its launch in 2008.

"Airbus is giving almost all of its employees, including senior managers, a $1,490 cash bonus to deal with rising inflation - Fortune","Tue, 25 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC8yNS9haXJidXMtZW1wbG95ZWVzLWJvbnVzLXJpc2luZy1pbmZsYXRpb24v0gFLaHR0cHM6Ly9mb3J0dW5lLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEwLzI1L2FpcmJ1cy1lbXBsb3llZXMtYm9udXMtcmlzaW5nLWluZmxhdGlvbi9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A number of companies have given their employees a one-off payment this year in hopes of softening the blow of skyrocketing inflation.

European airplane maker Airbus plans to give its employees a €1,500 bonus ($1,494) by the end of this year, according to French newspaper Le Figaro and French news agency Agence France-Presse. The bonus will go to nearly all of the company’s 126,000 employees, including senior management, in Germany, France, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Employees based elsewhere will also receive a bonus, but it will be based on the local average base salaries of those workers.

“The volatility, uncertainty, complexity, ambiguity that characterizes our environment have been further reinforced in recent months by the energy crisis and inflation,” Airbus said in a memo obtained by the French news outlets.

U.K. inflation rose 10.1% in September from the previous year. Germany’s rose 10% in the same period, and the overall eurozone’s annual inflation rate was 9.9%—driven mostly by surging energy costs. After invading Ukraine, Russia was hit with sanctions by Western nations. It responded by cutting its supply of natural gas to Europe, sending the continent spiraling into an energy crisis.

Europe’s ongoing economic troubles don’t seem like they’ll go away anytime soon. Inflation remains stubbornly high, and central banks are working to lower it by raising interest rates, all the while the war in Ukraine continues.

“The company believes that this solution is the most appropriate to support employees in the short term as they cope with the current inflationary environment,” an Airbus spokesperson told Insider.

Despite the potential financial hit companies take by awarding one-time employee bonuses, it’s something several European businesses—especially banks and financial services institutions—have said they would do.

Virgin Money and HSBC, both British banks, over the summer said they planned to give some employees one-time payments of £1,000 ($1,147) and £1,500 ($1,721), respectively, to help them stay afloat. Earlier, Lloyds Banking (a U.K. financial institution) said it would give a one-time payment of £1,000 ($1,147) to all staff, except for senior executives.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997169375419617}",neutral,0.9997169375419617,0
"Three missions, one aircraft: Airbus A400M shows its potential in the UK - Airbus","Tue, 11 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTEwLXRocmVlLW1pc3Npb25zLW9uZS1haXJjcmFmdC1haXJidXMtYTQwMG0tc2hvd3MtaXRzLXBvdGVudGlhbC1pbi10aGUtdWvSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As part of its commitment with the countries operating the A400M under the Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR), Airbus Defence and Space successfully completed a Crew Workload Assessment mission conducted in the UK. Performed by the Airbus MSN6 prototype, and operated from Royal Air Force (RAF) Brize Norton, the objective was to evaluate the crew workload while performing the three key tactical capabilities ofthe A400Mon one single flight: Aerial Delivery, Low-level Flight and Air-to-air refuelling.

Omne Trinum est Perfectum. This Latin phrase means that everything that comes in `threes´ is perfect, or, every set of three is complete, could be easily applied when referring to the A400M. The aircraft responds to a highly varied needs of world Air Forces and other organisations as it performs three very different types of duties: tactical and strategic missions directly to the site of action, as well as air-to-air refuelling. Three key capabilities that describe the whole potential of an A400M.

On 26 September, the Airbus prototype MSN6 took off from the San Pablo plant in Seville. Its destination: Royal Air Force Brize Norton airfield, our host and witness of this complex mission. The MSN6 proudly shows, painted on its fuselage, the flags of the 10 different countries that already have chosen the A400M. Ahead, one more day for a final check over the flight plan for Wednesday, 28 September.

The A400M can perform missions which previously required two - or more - different types of aircraft, and is capable of manoeuvres that many would not expect from a transport aircraft of its size. The Crew Workload Assessment mission represents the operational summary of the A400M capability, as it includes the workload evaluation of its three key tactical missions and features in flight: Aerial Delivery, Low-level Flight and Air-to-air refuelling. “This mission has particular importance as it provides our customers with distinct confirmation and confidence in the maturity of the A400M as a modern and capable tactical asset,” explained Simon Nicastro, A400M Flight & Integration Test Programme Manager at Airbus.

Crew Workload Assessment: A `3 in 1´ mission

During this exercise, the A400M flexed its muscles over UK skies showing how it excels when it comes to speed and height. Flying over Scotland, the first phase of the flight included aerial refuelling with the MSN6 acting as a receiver from a RAF A330 MRTT Voyager tanker. Rapidly changing operational scenarios required rapid changing configuration and, although it was not tested in this mission, the built-in air-to-air refuelling capability allows the aircraft to be also rapidly reconfigured to become a tanker, an adaptability which is unique to the A400M.

Once refuelled, during the second part of the flight, the MSN6 demonstrated how, despite its weight, it was able to conduct a steep descent and a low-level flight. This unique capability for a military transport aircraft improves the A400M’s terrain masking and survivability, making the aircraft less detectable in hostile areas and less susceptible to threats when cruising towards key military operations.

As part of its commitment with the countries operating the A400M under the Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR), Airbus Defence and Space successfully completed a Crew Workload Assessment mission conducted in the UK. Performed by the Airbus MSN6 prototype, and operated from Royal Air Force (RAF) Brize Norton, the objective was to evaluate the crew workload while performing the three key tactical capabilities of the A400M on one single flight: Aerial Delivery, Low-level Flight and Air-to-air refuelling.

For the last phase of the flight, the MSN6 showed what it is capable of when `playing´ with both speed and height. During this phase, four loads of 1 tonne each were dropped over a controlled drop zone from the cargo hold. The type’s low-speed characteristics make the A400M ideal for dropping supplies from low altitude, assuring a very rapid and direct response to any occurrence and, once on the ground, is designed for very rapid cargo unloading or loading without any specialised ground support equipment, minimising the aircraft’s vulnerability to hostile action.

This whole mission was conducted by the minimum crew required for the task: two pilots and one loadmaster assisted by two qualified cargo crew, having also on board at the controls the crew authorities from the Certification and Qualification Organisation (CQO) in order to confirm the acceptability of workload results. “During the flight, the crew received a replanning order to avoid a certain area simulating a ground threat, and also to modify the load delivery in order to be representative of a complex operational mission our customers could face in a real scenario,” explained César González, Flight Test Engineer on board. “All objectives were accomplished and the mission was fully successful, revealing that the crew workload was fully acceptable for this kind of complex operation,” he added.

For such a mission, there is an experienced team behind working in perfect harmony with the customer. “This is the last complex campaign to coordinate and execute with our customers, involving a significant amount of Government Furnished Facilities (GFF) provided by the UK MoD and the Royal Air Force, including aerial delivery loads, a Voyager tanker and several military zones. It has been a tremendous effort and a huge success for the entire Airbus team and another example of `We are ONE´ with our customers,” said David Ferro, A400M Chief Engineer at Airbus.

Once the mission was accomplished, the MSN6 headed back to its hangar in Seville, awaiting for the next challenge to come.

Parachuting, another key capability tested by the Royal Air Force with its A400M

Parachuting remains a key capability for current military operations. Recently, paratroopers of the RAF made the first low-level parachute descents from the Royal Air Force’s A400M, as it will be the aircraft to deliver the military’s parachuting capability in 2023.

The trials had been planned and delivered by No. 206 Squadron, the RAF’s heavy aircraft test and evaluation squadron and the Joint Air Delivery Test and Evaluation Unit. RAF dispatches from the Parachute Test Team assisted the parachutists in the safe fitting and checking of equipment, conducting final checks prior to despatch, and ensuring the safe despatch of parachutists from the aircraft before recovering their static lines.

The A400M excels in the parachuting role, as it is able to carry more paratroopers over a greater distance, a capability that reinforces the strategic value the A400M already offers to air force operators and society.

The 21st A400M for UK, delivered to the Royal Air Force

With the MSN056 delivered this week to the UK, the Royal Air Force has now taken delivery of 21 of the 22 A400M on order.

Since the first A400M delivery to the UK back in 2014, the Royal Air Force has performed several key missions having this new generation airlifter as a big asset and highlighting its reach and payload. During Kabul´s evacuation, the UK’s RAF evacuated more than 15,000 people with more than 100 evacuation flights, 31 of which were conducted by the A400M. Among others, the RAF also completed a nine-hour round-trip mission with an A400M from the UK to conduct airdrop resupply in support of a UK Army training Exercise in Estonia. After the years, the RAF and the A400M continue its trustful and growing relationship.

The A400M was launched in 2003 to respond to the combined needs of seven European Nations grouped within OCCAR (Belgium, France, Germany, Luxemburg, Spain, Turkey and the UK), with Malaysia joining in 2005. This is one of the major reasons behind its extreme versatility, and the reason why already 10 countries have the new generation airlifter among their fleets.

“The A400M is becoming a key asset for our customers' military air transport activities and operations, and missions like this show that we are always on duty for them, as they are always on duty for everyone else when it matters most”, said Jean-Brice Dumont, Head of Military Air Systems at Airbus Defence and Space.

Airbus with its A400M wants to fulfil the diverse requirements of nations around the globe in terms of military and humanitarian missions for the benefit of society, as those simulated during this exercise in the UK.

DALLAS – Air Canada (AC) announced today that it has ordered 15 additional Airbus A220-300 aircraft. This brings the total number of A220s the airline has ordered from 45 to 60 aircraft.

The A220 is already an important aircraft for AC. The Canadian airline operates over 30 of these aircraft on its medium-haul network in North America, Mexico, and the Caribbean islands.

AC was the first operator of the type in North America, as it started the A220 service in January 2020. The aircraft are built in Mirabel (YMX), a few miles away from AC’s hub in Montreal (YUL).

The Canadian airline operates over 100 Airbus aircraft, including A330s for its long-haul network and A320 family aircraft on its medium-haul routes, as well as the A220. Moreover, AC has a firm order for ten A321XLR aircraft, which will allow the airline to open new low-density routes.

Comments from Air Canada, Airbus

“The A220 has become an important component in the modernization of Air Canada’s fleet and a key part of our narrowbody fleet, thanks to its performance and passenger comfort”, said Mark Galardo, the Senior Vice President for Network Planning and Revenue Management at AC.

He continued, “The A220 is the perfect aircraft for our North American network thanks to its economics, and its fuel efficiency also supports Air Canada’s commitment to reduce emissions on the way to its goal of net zero emissions from all global operations by 2050”

Christian Scherer, Airbus’ Chief Commercial Officer (CCO), said, “We are honored that Air Canada is coming back for more A220s. This demonstrates the value the aircraft is bringing and we are proud to provide our customer with a high level of flexibility, great economics, and a real passenger appeal.”

He added, “With already over 30 aircraft in service with the airline, the A220 has established itself as an efficient route-opener, as well as a mainline workhorse, strengthening the carriers’ continental network while delivering on Air Canada’s ambitious decarbonization targets. We thank Air Canada for their continued trust in Airbus.”

With this additional order, AC confirms its confidence in the A220, which will allow the airline to renew its medium-haul fleet and increase its capacity.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9756050109863281}",neutral,0.9756050109863281,0

Funds and accounts managed by BlackRock Private Equity Partners also will invest in the transaction, AEI said in a statement. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

York makes low-Earth orbit, geosynchronous equatorial orbit and cislunar spacecraft. The company’s products are designed for communications, EO/IR, radio frequency, hyperspectral, weather, remote proximity ops and other operations and can meet the schedule-driven, high-volume demand for small satellite constellations, AEI said.

The company serves government and commercial customers, including the Space Development Agency, for whom York is providing spacecraft as part of both Tranche 0 and Tranche 1 of the agency’s Transport Layer. It has about 165,000 square feet of manufacturing space in Colorado, and with the opening of a facility in the Denver Tech Center, York can produce more than 750 satellites a year.

“With its innovative spacecraft designs and manufacturing processes, York has revolutionized the small satellite market, which is poised for significant growth in both the government and commercial markets over the next 20 years,” said Kirk Konert, partner at AEI, in the statement. “Backing the largest independent small satellite manufacturer represents a unique opportunity to serve the fast-growing LEO commercialization and national security markets.”

CEO Dirk Wallinger, who founded York in 2012, will continue to lead the company, and Chairman Charles “Chuck” Beames will remain on its board of directors. Both maintain significant ownership positions in York, AEI said.

Kirkland & Ellis LLP served as legal advisor and Ernst & Young as financial advisor to AEI. Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP acted as legal advisor and Jefferies LLC as exclusive financial advisor to York.

Separately, AEI said Chris Emerson, former chairman and CEO of Airbus U.S. Space & Defense, joined the firm as an operating partner, effective immediately. He also serves on the boards of AEI portfolio companies Belcan, Firefly Aerospace and The Atlas Group.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999970197677612}",neutral,0.9999970197677612,0
LATAM Airbus aircraft A320 suffers heavy damage after flying through storm - AeroTime,"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMzI1MTctbGF0YW0tYWlyYnVzLWEzMjAtaGVhdnktZGFtYWdlLWZseWluZy10aHJvdWdoLXN0b3Jt0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWVyb3RpbWUuYWVyby9hcnRpY2xlcy8zMjUxNy1sYXRhbS1haXJidXMtYTMyMC1oZWF2eS1kYW1hZ2UtZmx5aW5nLXRocm91Z2gtc3Rvcm0vYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A LATAM Airbus A320 aircraft sustained significant damage to its windshield, engine and radome after flying through a storm.

LATAM flight 1325 was flying from Santiago’s Arturo Merino Benítez International Airport (SCL) in Chile, to Asuncion’s Silvio Pettirossi International Airport (ASU) in Paraguay on October 26, 2022 with 48 passengers on board.

While attempting to land at ASU, the crew initiated a go-around due to bad weather and had to divert the aircraft to Foz de Iguaçu Airport (IGU) in Brazil. After staying in IGU for about three hours, the flight departed again towards ASU in Paraguay.

It was when the aircraft, a 10-year old Airbus with registration CC-BAZ, was approaching Asuncion that it encountered severe weather. Passengers in the aircraft captured footage of the severe turbulence, which has been uploaded to social media.

Terrified passengers can be heard screaming as the aircraft shook violently, while another videoshows lightning flashes outside the aircraft window during the turbulence.

The severe weather forced the flight crew to perform an emergency landing at ASU airport. Once on ground, the damage to the aircraft’s radome and windscreen was clearly visible.

LATAM confirmed to CNN that the flight experienced “severe weather conditions during its flight path,” and that “Passengers and crew are safe and well,” adding that it regretted any inconvenience the situation may have caused to passengers.

Meanwhile, Reuters reported that Paraguay’s aviation authority had opened an investigation on the incident.

“This issue is under investigation, both on the DINAC side and on the side of the airline,” Paraguay’s National Directorate of Civil Aeronautics (DINAC), Félix Kanasawa told a local radio station.

Investigators will be looking into why the aircraft penetrated the storm and whether it could have been avoided.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9159870743751526}",neutral,0.9159870743751526,0

Gandhinagar, October 20, 2022 – The Airbus Defence and Space Quality Management System (QMS) for the C295 aircraft has received approval from the Directorate General of Aeronautical Quality Assurance (DGAQA), the Indian regulatory authority for aeronautical quality assurance. This is the first time a QMS of a foreign aircraft manufacturer has been approved by DGAQA.

The certificate of approval was handed over by Director General of DGAQA, Sanjay Chawla to Kajetan von Mentzingen, Head of Quality, Airbus Defence and Space at a ceremony held on the sidelines of DefExpo 2022, in Gandhinagar. This is a significant first step of a comprehensive quality assurance roadmap agreed between Airbus and DGAQA for the C295 ‘Make in India’ programme.

Speaking on the approval, Kajetan von Mentzingen said, “We have crossed a milestone for the C295 ‘Make in India’ programme. This certification demonstrates the trust and confidence that DGAQA places in Airbus quality standards. It marks the beginning of a robust and comprehensive roadmap that Airbus has put in place for the C295 ‘Make in India’ programme. It will be the foundation for successful aircraft manufacturing in India under the policy of Aatmanirbhar Bharat.”

India formalised the acquisition of 56 Airbus C295 aircraft to replace the Indian Air Force (IAF) legacy AVRO fleet, in September 2021. Under the contractual agreement, Airbus will deliver the first 16 aircraft in ‘fly-away’ condition from its final assembly line in Seville, Spain. The remaining 40 aircraft will be manufactured and assembled by Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL) in India as part of an industrial partnership between the two companies. This certification is part of this programme, which involves the full development of a complete industrial ecosystem: from the production of detailed parts to assembly, test and qualification, to delivery and maintenance of the complete lifecycle of the aircraft.

Airbus maintains position in North American air medical market - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3ZlcnRpY2FsbWFnLmNvbS9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy9uZXctb3JkZXJzLWFmZmlybS1haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtcG9zaXRpb24taW4tbm9ydGgtYW1lcmljYW4tYWlyLW1lZGljYWwtaGVsaWNvcHRlci1tYXJrZXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters continues to be the leading provider of helicopters to the North American air medical transport industry, with both new and longstanding customers from around the continent placing orders. More than 35 new single and twin-engine Airbus helicopters were sold in the air medical market alone over the past 12 months.

“Airbus is proud to support our partners in the air medical industry with the most comprehensive line of aircraft that ensure they can perform their mission of caring for patients each day,” said Romain Trapp, president of Airbus Helicopters, Inc. and head of the North American region. “We recognize that helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) providers rely on their helicopters to save lives, and we remain dedicated to providing them with state-of-the-art options they can count on when minutes matter.”

Highlights include Atrium Health, which will enhance its MedCenter Air emergency and critical care patient transport services in the Carolinas with the addition of three new twin-engine H135 helicopters. These aircraft will join the company’s existing H135 fleet.

Global Medical Response (GMR) has opted to add two new H135 aircraft to their fleet this year, on top of their existing fleet order from 2021. The operator flies a variety of Airbus products, including the H125, H130, H135 and H145 family helicopters due to their proven reliability, and continues to grow their fleet in partnership with Airbus.

These H135 additions come on top of orders for the helicopter by Stat MedEvac and North Memorial Health, both announced at Heli-Expo earlier this year.

New orders for the five-bladed H145 helicopter were placed by air medical operators located in the Northeast and Midwest United States. For example, Boston MedFlight placed a multi-year order for six H145 helicopters this year. The operator was the first air medical provider in the U.S. to place an order for the five-bladed H145 as announced at Heli-Expo.

OSF HealthCare will add one H145 to its current fleet of four H145s serving Peoria, Bloomington, Peru, Galesburg and Rockford, Illinois. Mayo Clinic recently ordered two H145s to complement the one ordered in 2021, as well.

Another highlight is the purchase of a single-engine H125 by the Daniel R. Sayre Memorial Foundation, which will be donated to the Hawaii Fire Department to enhance their emergency medical services. This is the department’s first Airbus product and will also be used for search and rescue missions.

A leading helicopter in the single-engine HEMS market in the U.S., the H125 features the largest cabin in its class that can carry up to four people and medical equipment when configured for emergency medical transportation.

The Airbus H135, the world-wide fleet leader for HEMS missions, is recognized as an excellent tool for the air medical transport industry. The lightweight rotorcraft offers the highest safety levels in its class, contributing to its position as the worldwide fleet leader in emergency medical services. The H135 features a spacious cabin that allows providers to directly access a patient in the event of an emergency.

The H145 meets the needs of air medical operators, providing high performance, twin-engine reliability and flexibility with multiple EMS cabin interiors. The aircraft’s wide sliding doors and large rear clamshell doors facilitate safe and easy loading and unloading of patients.The five-bladed version of the helicopter, thanks to its innovative rotor system, offers customers with an increased useful load by 330 lbs, eased maintenance and a smoothened ride on-board, which benefits both crews and patients flying on-board the H145.

All of these additions build on a more than 50-year tradition of Airbus supporting HEMS operators as they work to save lives. More than half of all air medical helicopters flying in North America were produced by Airbus, and Airbus helicopters are flown by all of the continent’s major HEMS operators.

The sky's the limit as Airbus continues to expand - Business Alabama,"Wed, 05 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3NhbGFiYW1hLmNvbS9haXJidXMtYWRkcy10aGlyZC1maW5hbC1hc3NlbWJseS1saW5lL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The global aircraft maker is adding a third final assembly line, increasing production, doubling its footprint and its workforce in Mobile — all to meet a worldwide demand

There are only three basic concerns at Airbus in Mobile these days beyond making the popular A320/321 and A220 jets its known for — build additional facilities that more than double the company’s footprint here; equip them with all the required jigs and tools for a major manufacturing program; and find another 1,200 or more employees when the state’s at nearly full employment.

All in a time of snarled supply chains and inflationary increases to costs.

But Daryl Taylor is upbeat about it.

“We are blessed to have certainly the most successful commercial aircraft in history,” says Taylor, who is vice president and general manager of Airbus’ Final Assembly Line USA.

The worldwide company has an order backlog for more than 6,000 of the single-aisle A320/321 aircraft. Globally, the company has been producing 64 aircraft a month. In an earnings call with investors in April, CEO Guillaume Faury announced plans to increase the rate to 75 a month by 2025 or 2026.

And that meant changes at the company’s facilities.

In Mobile, it means new paint shops, new final phase flight line hangars, and a third final assembly line — big projects for a rapidly growing presence in Mobile.

Just 10 years ago, Airbus officials announced plans to have any plane-making presence in Mobile. There had been an engineering facility here for a while and a helicopter support center. But joining the ranks of cities actually making commercial jets was such big news that city officials threw a party at the Convention Center.

Since the April word from global headquarters, the Mobile facility has already appointed a project manager — HPM, which superintended the first two FAL projects. Contracts have been awarded for the paint shops and hangars. Ground is being turned and a construction village is taking shape. Workshops have been offered for local companies that might like to be considered for various elements of the project.

“We will almost double the footprint of what we have in Mobile today to accommodate the growth,” Taylor says.

The first pieces should be done next year, with the FAL opening in 2025.

While supply chain issues could disrupt plans, Taylor says the aircraft maker was aware of problems when it set schedules.

“From a construction point of view, we’re seeing the strain on the system — delays in the steel market and in the mechanical equipment — but we’re not seeing that we can’t get them,” says Taylor. “We’ve accommodated that in our timeline. That’s why we’ve started building as quickly as we have. What might have taken us 12 months to build a building previously, it’s going to be more like 15 months this time. And we’ve accommodated that in our detailed planning from Day 1.”

Jigs and tools — the equipment needed to assemble an aircraft — are in the same situation. “The good news — most of this has been built before. We’re not designing anything significantly new,” Taylor says. “We’re in the middle of finalizing a new FAL in our Toulouse facility so we’re able to take lessons learned there. We recognize that the timeline to build some of these new tools is longer than it was before, so all of that is built into the project timeline.

“In a company the scale of Airbus, while we might not always be putting new jigs and tools into Mobile, we are putting them into Hamburg, Toulouse, Tianjin, our facilities in Canada, Germany — we have a pretty mature organization that’s capable of doing this; we have a very mature supply chain.”

People are the final element needed. Right now, the company employs just more than 1,400 workers. By the time the third FAL opens, it will need another 1,000, perhaps as many as 1,300.

Three new programs have been instituted to attract more workers.

First is an apprenticeship program in partnership with Bishop State Community College. Taylor, who started his career with an apprenticeship at the Airbus wing facility in Broughton in the UK, is a firm believer in the power of apprenticeship to develop workers. The 45 students in the program that started this year spend several months in Bishop State classes learning the basics in a program called Flight Path 9, then spend three months in classes developed for Airbus by the state’s AIDT program, and then 12 months on the shop floor rotating through a variety of workstations.

The firm has also created a new program, Airbus On Board, which offers people with five years of work experience in any field a chance to be retrained for aerospace work. The first class of 50 is in progress now, with plans to offer the program twice a year going forward.

Finally, Airbus has created Airbus Global Graduate Program, bringing new college graduates to the team. The first cohort has four people, but plans call for increasing it to 20 or 30.

“We’re trying to create a mix of developing our own talent and hiring,” says Taylor. Hiring 1,200 people simply by tapping the market would not be feasible, he says. But if Airbus can find two thirds of its needed personnel through its own training programs and connections with nearby universities, the task becomes more manageable.

With all the need for growth, why Mobile?

U.S. customers like the option of U.S.-built planes, he says. Delta, American, Frontier, Spirit and United (which is waiting for the A321XLR) all appreciate the convenience of picking up new planes here rather than in Europe.

Since opening in 2015, Airbus Mobile has delivered 300 A320/321 aircraft. The demand is also growing for the A220 craft, made in Mobile and in Mirabel, Canada. Delta, JetBlue, Air France and KLM have been adding the smaller jet to their fleets and startup Breeze Airways has built its entire business plan around the A220. The excellent Bombardier design coupled with Airbus expertise supporting commercial aircraft are leading to an exponential growth in sales, Taylor says.

More than that, Mobile has offered Airbus an unusual degree of support. City, county and state officials have stood alongside business leaders to welcome Airbus, support its plans nationally and help it succeed.

That alignment for support, says Taylor: “That’s the magic source that happens in Alabama that doesn’t happen elsewhere.”
