Airbus Awarded $2.3B Canadian Search-and-Rescue Project - Defense News,"Wed, 07 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9icmVha2luZy1uZXdzLzIwMTYvMTIvMDcvYWlyYnVzLWF3YXJkZWQtMi0zYi1jYW5hZGlhbi1zZWFyY2gtYW5kLXJlc2N1ZS1wcm9qZWN0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"VICTORIA, British Columbia — Canadian Cabinet ministers will announce Dec. 8 that the Airbus C-295 has been selected as the country's new fixed-wing search-and-rescue (SAR) aircraft, according to multiple industry sources.





Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan and Procurement Minister Judy Foote will release the details that morning at the Royal Canadian Air Force base in Trenton, Ontario.



The deal will be worth around CAN$3 billion (US $2.3 billion) and would include long-term, in-service support.



The Airbus Defense and Space C-295 was selected over the C-27J aircraft from Leonardo (formerly Finmeccanica ), according to the industry sources.



Embraer of Brazil also bid the KC-390 for the Canadian program.



Airbus officials declined to comment, referring questions to the Canadian government.



Sajjan's press secretary, Jordan Owens, declined to confirm any details on the contract award set for Thursday. "" ‎I can say that we look forward to giving our women and men in uniform the tools they need to continue to deliver effective search-and-rescue operations ‎,"" she said.

Airbus Defence and Space has teamed with key Canadian firms for the project and other ventures on the C-295. Those include PAL Aerospace on in-service support, Pratt & Whitney Canada for engines, CAE for training and simulation, and L3 Wescam for the electro-optic sensors.



The new planes will replace the Royal Canadian Air Force's 40-year-old Buffalo aircraft and older-model C-130s currently assigned to search-and-rescue duties.



Airbus previously said it will build a new training facility in Comox, British Columbia, if it wins the contract.



""For us, it's a logical location for it, as there's ready access to a variety of environments where SAR crews operate, including over the ocean, in the mountains and the North,"" Michael Powell, an Airbus spokesman, said earlier this year.



The Fixed Wing Search and Rescue (FWSAR) aircraft project is divided into a contract for the acquisition of the aircraft and another contract for 20 years of in-service support.



The Air Force expects all aircraft for the FWSAR program to be delivered by 2023.



The FWSAR project originally envisioned acquiring 17 aircraft. But that has now changed and will be capability based, according to government officials. The aerospace firms submitted in their bids the numbers of aircraft they believe are needed for Canada to handle the needed SAR capability.



In the bids, the firms were required to submit prices and aircraft numbers for a fleet to operate out of four main existing bases across Canada. Information was also requested for having planes operating from three bases.



The Canadian government originally announced its intent in the spring of 2004 to buy a fleet of new fixed-wing SAR aircraft, but the purchase has been on and off ever since.



The FWSAR project was sidelined over the years by more urgent purchases of equipment for Canada's Afghanistan mission as well as complaints made in the House of Commons by domestic aerospace firms and Airbus that the Air Force favored the C-27J aircraft for the fixed-wing SAR plane.



The Air Force strenuously denied any preference for an aircraft.

Hangar of the future - Airbus,"Tue, 06 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE2LTEyLWhhbmdhci1vZi10aGUtZnV0dXJl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus aims to reboot the MRO sector with its Hangar of the Future, an innovative application of state-of-the-art technologies and methods aimed at increasing operational efficiency for customers’ aircraft and rotorcraft worldwide.

MRO providers in Singapore have a problem: airlines are going elsewhere for their maintenance and repair. “Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines are drawing MRO [Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul] business away because they’re cheaper,” explains David Woon, Hangar of the Future project manager. “And because of this intense competition, Singapore's MROs don’t have the time or money to invest in new technologies.”

In February 2016, the Singapore government enlisted Airbus to help local MRO providers improve productivity, with the intention of setting up a testbed where new technologies can be tested in a research environment. By October 2016, Airbus’s Hangar of the Future project was underway.

Responding to change

At its inception, the Airbus Innovations-led Hangar of the Future concept aimed to increase operational efficiency in MROs by applying both the Group’s lean management experience and proven state-of-the-art technologies to the maintenance sector. Ultimately, the Hangar’s revamped MRO services will be a crucial step in providing the Group’s customers with end-to-end solutions. ""Today, instead of selling the aircraft and support package, we’re often contracted to provide mission availability"", says Pierre Nicoli, Head of new services development at Airbus Helicopters.



MROs are facing a rapidly changing business environment. As Pierre Nicoli, head of new services development at Airbus Helicopters explains, customer contracts are changing. Whether it’s a search and rescue operation that needs aircraft on demand, oil and gas sector helicopters logging more than 2,000 flight hours per year, or militaries facing budget cuts who need to optimise their limited fleet, implementing a more efficient maintenance process translates into securing the same availability and capability with fewer helicopters – a big benefit for operators.

A new perspective

While Airbus isn’t new to lean manufacturing, having benefitted from its application across the Group’s final assembly lines (FALs), the concept of creating more value for customers with fewer resources is new to MROs. “It’s a different philosophy,” says Christophe De Flaugergues, who manages functional knowledge for Airbus’ e-solution organisation.

Ideas like bundling tasks – e.g., repairing two different parts located under the same panel at the same time – are easily translatable from one environment to the other. However, the more predictable structure of the FAL, with strict processes and few unexpected events (because the aircraft are not flying), is different from MROs, full of shifting circumstances that require plans to be revised.

Nicoli notes that there are also differences between airplane and rotorcraft maintenance, both of which the Hangar of the Future aims to tackle. “We don’t always land in big airports with big hangars, but could be anywhere from industrialised areas to deserts.” In addition to expediting daily operations, when aircraft require servicing in remote locations, cutting-edge technology is vital.

Aiding the experts

Technologies developed and knowledge gathered by De Flaugergues’ and Nicoli’s teams will be translated into the initial demonstrator phase of the Hangar of the Future. Maintenance mobility, for example, currently deployed at JetBlue, will transition from a data-collection tool for airline operations to a task-execution monitoring tool for MROs, delivering valuable maintenance information to technicians before the aircraft has even touched down.

“Hopefully, maintenance operators are experts,” says François Guillaume, Hangar of the Future’s technical lead. But the difficulty is in the context. It’s easy to waste time locating the equipment and information needed to prepare the task. Guillaume describes augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) as the perfect technologies to build a bridge between physical products and the digital world. In the case of a stalled helicopter in the desert, for example, AR would be a crucial way to guide technicians through a rare repair. ""Maintaining an aircraft doesn’t usually happen in a nice office with air-con and good light – you have time pressure, it’s dark, it’s raining, and the operators themselves trained on different aircraft – there are a lot of constraints"", says Guillaume.



Automated non-destructive testing (NDT) in this case, an inspection scan of the aircraft upon entering the hangar – will allow experts to concentrate on defect analysis and classification instead of searching for data. The Internet of Things concept, integrated through RFID technology, will be used to identify and track tools and parts. It will be interfaced with the supervision module in a ‘control room’, which helps operators and customers follow activities performed on the aircraft and anticipate modifications.

Drones and robots will also enable the Group to obtain information and specificity it has never had before, like aircraft structure, flight hours, and issues accumulated over time.

“The Air-Cobot robot, currently designed for inspecting aircraft from the ground, could be connected with a flying drone to access the top of the aircraft and speed up the data capture (from 2 hours with conventional means to 15 minutes). EasyJet is testing drone inspection today, and we are also testing them on the A330 FAL through the Aircam project. We will also try to use drones to accurately size up the damage and earlier identify unplanned repairs,” says De Flaugergues.



With this input populating a collective database, Airbus will be able to better predict future issues based on past issues and maintenance. “By integrating physical software, we’ll enrich the way we predict unexpected events.”

Proof and partnerships

The Hangar of the Future’s test bed component not only offers an easy way to test and develop new technology, it also enables any of the Hangar’s project partners – from local Singaporean start-ups to companies like 3M – to come in and interface with this technology in a real hangar and real aircraft.

To be as efficient as possible in the digital environment, says De Flaugergues, harnessing data is key. “The Hangar of the Future, in connecting the maintenance information system, the physical means, the software and the aircraft, generates a lot more information than we have today. Once we are able to analyse this new data and cross-reference it, we can provide better predictions.”

“This initiative is unique and totally unprecedented in Airbus Singapore,” says Woon, “because it combines the ingenuity and efforts of several business divisions – Airbus Services Asia Pacific (ASAP), Satair, TESTIA Asia Pacific and Airbus Helicopters Southeast Asia (AHSA) – in one single endeavour. We’re integrating and deploying new ideas into a real hangar environment, close to our customers.”

Jason Watches the Airbus A350-1000 Fly for the First Time - Airline Reporter,"Fri, 30 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxNi8xMi9qYXNvbi13YXRjaGVzLXRoZS1haXJidXMtYTM1MC0xMDAwLWZseS1mb3ItdGhlLWZpcnN0LXRpbWUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"I would say that Jason Rabinowitz and I are pretty good friends. He also writes for AirlineReporter from time to time. Often he reaches out and asks if it is okay to share a story. I have never turned him down. Other times I spend lots and lots of time trying to convince him to share his story. He often agrees. Neither of these is the case for when he went to watch the first flight of the Airbus A350-1000 in Toulouse, France.

%CODE3%

I couldn’t go, so I wanted to live through his story. He had a great time, shared it via his social media, took some great photos, but I couldn’t convince him to write up the story. Fine. Guess what? I am going to write up a story for him. Kinda.

Information on the A350-1000

You have probably heard of the Airbus A350. The 1000 model is the largest version of the family. When I asked Jason to describe the aircraft to me, he responded, “long plane is long.” Can’t argue with that. “But seriously, the A350-1000 is quiet. Pretty much everything else that took off while we were waiting made more noise than the 1000.”

Personally, I think the proportions look the best with this longer version. Probably looks better on many airline’s balance sheets too.

Before the flight, they set up all the media out by the runway with a nice view. What better way to pass the time than watching other brand spanking new Airbus aircraft take off? And he got to see a few. “Sure, the conditions weren’t great, but it made for some pretty dramatic shots.”

This was Jason’s first first flight. As in he has never seen the first flight of any other aircraft type. He was pretty excited to have the honor. “I have to say that I was humbled to be a part of history. I was standing with journalists from around the world in anticipation for the first flight. No joke, I had AvGeek goose bumps.” (Jason didn’t actually tell me that. I tried to ask him how it was and his answer was kind of lame. So this is what I think Jason was actually thinking. He says I am not that far off)

’œIt was cool seeing thousands of employees suddenly appear out of nowhere to watch it, and then just as suddenly disappear to get back to work,’ Rabinowitz actually did explain to me. ’œBut, you know what’s going to happen. It’s going to take off and come back a few hours later.’ And he was right. That is exactly what it did. Its first flight lasted a bit over four hours and then it returned to an awaiting crowd. “The best part of the day was seeing the excitement of the flight crew as they exited the aircraft after the successful flight. Unlike Boeing test pilots, the Airbus pilots wear bright orange flight suits, which gives it a little bit more of an #AvGeek feel.” (he actually said “hashtag”)

%CODE2%

Jason has only flown on the A350 once and it was a really short flight; from Newark (EWR) to Chicago (ORD). It was a special media flight on the second A350 test plane.

Although I might be jealous that he was there for the first flight, I can only expect he is a bit jealous that I have already flown on the A350. ’œYou were delayed like 4 hours,’ Jason said when I asked him if he was jealous. ’œI’m fine having missed that one.’

Sure, it was delayed, but it was still awesome. I know he was jealous. ’œMeh, I’ll get mine.’ I hope that you do Jason. And when you do, please share it with us on Airlinereporter (without me having to write it for you).

Unrelated to this story, it was important for Jason to let you all know that I am his favorite blogger ever and I really am as funny as I think I am. That means a lot to me — thanks Jason.

Airbus finalizes Iran Air order for 100 planes - USA TODAY,"Thu, 22 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90cmF2ZWwvZmxpZ2h0cy90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTYvMTIvMjIvYWlyYnVzLWZpbmFsaXplcy1pcmFuLWFpci1vcmRlci0xMDAtcGxhbmVzLzk1NzQyNTU0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus finalizes Iran Air order for 100 planes

Airbus announced Thursday that Iran Air signed a firm contract for 100 aircraft, with deliveries to begin in early 2017.

The order is part of an enormous addition of planes to the state-owned airline, with Boeing selling 80 planes.

“Iran Air considers this agreement an important step towards a stronger international presence in civil aviation,” Iran Air CEO Farhad Parvaresh said in a statement. “We hope this success signals to the world that the commercial goals of Iran and its counterparts are better achieved with international cooperation and collaboration.”

But the orders, which required U.S. government approval because of technology aboard the planes, remain contentious in Congress. Some U.S. lawmakers contend the sales should be blocked because Iran remains listed as a sponsor of terrorism, and could use the planes to transport weapons and troops.

The sales agreements with Airbus and Boeing were completed after the Obama administration negotiated an agreement with Iran to curb its nuclear-weapons program. The U.S. had blocked trade with Iran as part of sanctions following the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran, which took over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.

President-elect Donald Trump, who will be inaugurated Jan. 20, has criticized the Boeing deal and said he would overturn it. The House approved a bill Nov. 17 from Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Mich., that would prohibit the U.S. Treasury from allowing any domestic financial institution from financing the sale of aircraft to Iran. The bill was approved by a vote of 243-174, although the Senate didn't act on it before Congress adjourned for the year.

Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenberg met Tuesday with Trump and said they discussed a variety of subjects, but he spoke to reporters only about the company's eagerness to build replacement aircraft to serve as Air Force One.

The Airbus order is for 46 A320 family aircraft, 38 A330 family planes and 16 A350 aircraft, the manufacturer announced. Airbus didn’t announce the total value of the deal, but A320s list for $98 million and A330-220s start at $231 million, although those prices are often discounted.

“This is a landmark agreement not only because it paves the way for Iran Air’s fleet renewal,” Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier said in a statement. “Our overall accord includes pilot training, airport operations and air traffic management so this agreement is also a significant first step in the overall modernization of Iran’s commercial aviation sector.”

The Boeing deal includes 50 737 MAX 8 aircraft, 15 777-300ER planes and 15 777-9 aircraft, the company announced Dec. 11. The order supports nearly 100,000 jobs, Boeing said. The planes list for a combined $16.6 billion, although airlines often get discounts from those prices.

The U.S. Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control granted export licenses for the European manufacturer, which are required for products containing at least 10% U.S. technology, in September and November.

Airbus Helicopters sued by three companies over H225 situation - Vertical Magazine,"Fri, 09 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLXN1ZWQtdGhyZWUtY29tcGFuaWVzLWgyMjUtc2l0dWF0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters is facing three separate lawsuits from owners of EC225LP/H225 Super Pumas who, among a range of damning allegations, are claiming Airbus sold the helicopters in a defective state due to an inherent problem in the main gearbox (MGB).

The three companies — Wells Fargo Bank (owner of Macquarie Rotorcraft Leasing Ltd.), Era Group Inc., and ECN Capital — are seeking remuneration for aircraft they claim are no longer airworthy, as well as damages and costs. Airbus has yet to respond to Era and ECN Capital’s claims in a legal capacity, but denied all allegations in court papers it submitted in response to Wells Fargo’s original petition.

When reached for comment by Vertical, Airbus said it refuted “the misleading and libelous allegations” included in the petitions from the three companies. “Airbus Helicopters will consider seeking remedies against any deliberate defamation,” the company added. Era and ECN declined to comment, while Wells Fargo did not return our call.

The global fleet of H225 Super Pumas remains largely grounded following the fatal crash of a CHC-operated H225 near Turøy, Norway, on April 29, which claimed the lives of all 11 passengers and two pilots on board after the main rotor separated from the fuselage. In the days and weeks following the crash, regulatory agencies around the globe — including the U.K.’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA); its Norwegian counterpart; the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA); and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration — grounded the type, as well as the AS332 L2 variant of the Super Puma.

In its most recent preliminary report on the crash, released on June 28, the Accident Investigation Bureau of Norway (AIBN) said a fatigue fracture in one of the aircraft’s MGB second stage planet gears was the most likely cause — and said the fracture propagated in a manner unlikely to be detected by existing mandatory or supplementary systems.

That report also drew comparisons to the fatigue fracture found in the second stage planet gear in the epicyclic module of an AS332 L2 that crashed off the coast of Peterhead, Scotland, in 2009. In that instance, a catastrophic failure of the helicopter’s MGB caused the main rotor and part of the epicyclic module to separate from the fuselage, and all 16 on board were killed as the aircraft hit the sea at high speed. After an extensive investigation, the MGB failure was found to have been caused by a fatigue fracture of a second stage planet gear in the epicyclic module.

On June 29 of this year, Airbus issued an Emergency Alert Service Bulletin that called on operators to replace one of the two types of second stage planet gears in service in the H225 with the other; the reason being that one type was found to have increased damage tolerance and showed enhanced reliability.

EASA authorized the AS332 L2 and H225 Super Pumas to fly again on Oct. 7, issuing an Airworthiness Directive (AD) that ordered operators to complete the actions described in Airbus’s EASB, as well as mandating a life reduction and more frequent inspection for certain parts in the MGB.

However, the U.K. and Norwegian civil aviation authorities and the FAA have kept their flight prohibitions for the type in place.

Macquarie owner Wells Fargo Bank, which owns a fleet of three H225s, was the first to file papers against Airbus on July 18, 2016. It took delivery of the aircraft between Oct. 1, 2014, and Jan. 27, 2015 — but the aircraft have never made it out of storage at an Airbus Helicopters facility in Germany.

In its filing with the District Court of Dallas County, Texas, Wells Fargo claimed breach of contract and breach of warranty. “Airbus breached the [purchase] agreement when it failed to deliver the helicopters in airworthy condition, with failure of the main rotor system . . . likely to exist or develop,” the company states in its original petition. “[Wells Fargo] cannot lease the helicopters to operators. Nor can it sell them without incurring substantial loss. . . . This leaves [Wells Fargo] with helicopters that it cannot fly, lease, or sell for any price that would not result in substantial losses.”

In its response to Wells Fargo’s petition, Airbus denied all allegations. In separate submissions arguing against Wells Fargo’s request for an early trial in late January or early February 2017, Airbus said the leasing company was seeking “to take advantage of a tragic EC225 helicopter accident” to return aircraft it was having difficulty leasing due to a downturn in the oil-and-gas industry.

“[Wells Fargo] claims that an EC225 accident that occurred in April 2016 in Norway, and a temporary precautionary grounding of EC225 helicopters by aviation authorities in several jurisdictions while the cause of the accident is investigated, justifies [Wells Fargo’s] revocation of acceptance of its helicopters,” Airbus stated in its papers. “In fact, essentially all civilian aircraft are from time to time subject to government agency actions that impose flight restrictions or other modifications following certain incidents or accidents. [Wells Fargo’s] attempt to return the helicopters is not because they were temporarily grounded pursuant to regulatory oversight. It is because [Wells Fargo] has been unable to turn a profit on them apparently due in large part to a change in market conditions.”

The case is set for a non-jury trial on July 25, 2017.

ECN Capital’s papers, filed Nov. 17, and Era’s, filed Nov. 24, contain similar claims. ECN purchased one H225 and four AS332 L2s from CHC (Barbados) as part of a leaseback agreement in 2013, while Era bought 10 H225s between 2006 and 2011.

Both companies point to the H225 and AS332 L2’s evolution from the earlier SA330 J and AS332 L variants, and claim that Airbus did not appropriately update the MGB to withstand the increased weight and power of the newer models.

In responding to this claim, Airbus told Vertical that the SA330 J, AS332 L and AS332 L2 have different MGB designs. “All main gear box components reused in the H225 design from the newer AS332 L2 were recomputed with the new capacity of the H225,” the company said. “This was done in full accordance with product evolution rules of certification which are a standard across the helicopter industry.”

In its original petition, Era said the representations made by Airbus regarding the safety, reliability, and design of the 225 and, in particular, the design and reliability of the main gear box, “were (and remain) demonstrably false in light of recent revelations by Airbus Helicopters that at least the second stage planet gears inside of the main gear box are irreparably defective, rendering the 225 unfit for flight.”

Further, Era claims that, following the AIBN’s last report, it undertook its own investigation to explore the condition of the second stage planet gears inside its EC225s.

“Multiple second stage planet gears in at least one of Era’s 225s exhibit characteristics of degradation and spalling associated with the design defect that has been identified as a causal factor in the catastrophic failures involving Super Puma helicopters,” the company claims in its petition.

“While there are indeed fundamental differences between the two planet gear configurations, the characteristics of degradation are evident on both the parts identified for replacement (i.e., the ‘bad’ parts) and the parts identified for retention (i.e., the ‘serviceable’ parts). Era has determined that even those parts identified by Airbus Helicopters as ‘serviceable’ exhibit the same symptoms of failure that have necessitated the immediate removal and disposal of the parts that Airbus Helicopters has now admitted are defective and unsafe.”

The petition also states that Era paid “hundreds of millions” to Airbus based on the manufacturer’s portrayal of the H225 as safe, reliable, and state-of-the-art in design and build, but “now owns a fleet of 225s that cannot be flown.”

According to figures provided by Airbus, there are currently 98 H225s and its military variant, H225Ms, in operation around the world, out of a total fleet of 264.

Artificial intelligence for the aerospace sector - Airbus,"Tue, 06 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE2LTEyLWFydGlmaWNpYWwtaW50ZWxsaWdlbmNlLWZvci10aGUtYWVyb3NwYWNlLXNlY3RvctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It looks for tumours, composes music and even drives cars: artificial intelligence – or AI for short – is a technology that’s currently changing the lives of each and every one of us. But what role does it play in an aerospace company like Airbus?

Chatting with Rose is really good fun – at least to begin with. She talks about her life in San Francisco, her two chickens and her pet cat. She comes across as funny, quick-witted and interested in what you have to say. But as the conversation proceeds, she turns out to be a rather poor conversationalist.

Whenever she can’t think of an answer to a question, she tries to change the subject with a question of her own. And when she gets bored, she threatens to end the conversation altogether. Still, it’s hard to get annoyed with her. After all, Rose isn’t a real person. She’s a chatbot. (You can meet Rose yourself at bit.ly/bot_rose).

It’s still early days in the development of chatbots – with ‘still’ being the operative word. That’s because AI is making them smarter all the time. Companies such as Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and IBM are working flat out to perfect their bots. It’s only a matter of time until they become a part of our everyday lives in the form of virtual assistants or customer service agents.

AI is also changing many other areas of our lives: it can diagnose cancer, operate cars, predict crime – and is therefore causing a huge amount of hype, particularly among major technology companies. But how relevant is this trend for an aerospace company? What potential does AI hold for Airbus?

Time to play a board game

To find out, FORUM paid a visit to the Airbus site in Munich where Ronny Fehling, head of data-driven technologies, has his office. Before starting at Airbus a year ago, the computer scientist worked in Silicon Valley, and with the big bean bags in the corridor and two of his colleagues playing table tennis in the office next door, there’s certainly a hint of Silicon Valley here.

Sitting in his office, he attempts to explain what AI is all about. It’s a tricky question – there are at least as many definitions of AI as there are experts in the field. Even Fehling has his very own definition: “Until something works, we call it AI. As soon as it works properly, it’s just an algorithm,” he says with a smile.

Put simply, AI could be described as the attempt to make machines think like humans. It’s an idea that’s more than 70 years old, and Airbus has long had AI applications. Airbus Helicopters has been using an artificial neural network since 2005 to adjust its rotor blades. Some years ago, however, AI was given a new lease of life, explains Fehling.

Deep learning, which is a system based on a deep neural network, is what’s responsible for this, he says. This network is modelled on the human brain and is ‘deep’ due to its numerous layers. You feed this network with data and examples, which it then processes, thus acquiring knowledge.

And it does so with a great deal of success. In March 2016, Lee Sedol – a South Korean champion in the Asian strategy game Go – was challenged to a match against the Google software AlphaGo.

Go is described as one of the world’s most complex games of strategy, and Google’s programme surprised its opponent with moves that no human had ever made before. It won the match 4-1, leaving behind a shocked Lee Sedol and the realisation that artificial neural networks with the capacity to learn are able to find their very own, completely new solutions. This makes the technology particularly interesting for several sectors, and Airbus is also exploring the new opportunities AI opens up.

However, as Fehling explains, it’s not just about jumping on the bandwagon and chasing the hype. “We’re not using these technologies just because it’s cool; we’re focussing on the requirements of our business fields.”

Super, computer!



A good business-focussed example is Airbus Smarter Fleet™, a cloud-based service platform developed by Airbus with the help of IBM. Smarter Fleet provides Airbus customers with various solutions, including intelligent maintenance and engineering tools, increased flight efficiency and optimised fuel consumption. Jaime Baringo and his team at Airbus in Toulouse are working to expand these services using AI.



Until now, computers have only been able to provide solutions to known problems with known root causes. IBM Watson, however, can do more than that. “It can process huge volumes of data and discover new, previously unknown root causes by establishing correlations that a human would never come up with,” explains Baringo. For example, Watson determined the precise relationship between the temperature and early wear of brakes. “This is a completely new finding, which will allow Airbus to develop prognostics that help airlines avoid delays,” Baringo continues.

According to Baringo, the potential of AI for Airbus can be best illustrated using the A350 XWB as an example: the aircraft has some 50,000 sensors on board and collects 2.5 terabytes of data every day. If you let AI loose on this data, then problems and correlations can be recognised faster and aircraft maturity can be achieved more quickly.

Chasing the clouds

A further area where deep learning has made considerable progress is in image recognition – and the Group is benefitting here, too. Since 29 September 2016, ‘One Atlas’ has been providing employees and customers with a large database of satellite images that can be accessed online. However, before these images from space end up in the database, clouds need to be identified and removed.

“That’s a lot harder than it sounds,” says Laurent Gabet, who manages optical research and development at Airbus Defence and Space. In fact it is sometimes very difficult to determine, even for the human eye, whether a particular area on a satellite image is cloud or snow.

Airbus Defence and Space uses an algorithm to identify these objects, but it has an error rate of 11%, which has prompted Gabet and his colleagues to test the deep-learning platform TensorFlow. This open source software from Google can be used and changed by anyone; Google provides the toolbox for others to work with. TensorFlow analyses a large number of images, looks for recurring patterns, and uses this to learn how to identify objects by itself.

In the TensorFlow test phase, the error rate has already improved to just 3%. Gabet is convinced that these new applications will make a huge difference: “Now that these programmes are freely available, the field of image recognition will progress in leaps and bounds and open up new opportunities,” he says.

AI, we have a problem

AI has achieved amazingly good results in many areas, but for Fehling, that is its biggest weakness. During a chat in his Munich office, he talked about the great potential of deep learning and new AI technologies, but he also pointed out a problem. Deep Learning and the other AI systems like Google’s TensorFlow, DeepMind typically have one thing in common: the knowledge they collect is hidden behind incredibly complex structures that are often difficult to analyse.



In addition, there are some AI issues that have yet to be clarified. What happens if something goes wrong? Does responsibility lie with the algorithm? Or with the person who developed it? “That’s why we are taking AI step by step,” he says. In the first instance, AI systems should provide help and support – without taking control. Developers inside the Group are already working on the next steps; for example, they are exploring ways in which AI can help make UAVs and passenger aircraft even safer.

AI, take over please

Some of the answers to how this works can be found at Airbus in Hamburg. Standing in front of a pile of white plastic parts, a smiling Detlev Konigorski explains: “Yes, that’s right: we’re going to make a plane from all of this.” The developer is currently constructing a new THOR test aircraft with with his emerging technologies and concepts team at Airbus – and the parts that his colleagues are dragging into place behind him are all fresh from the printer.

THOR completed its maiden flight in November 2015, making history as the first 3D-printed aircraft. The next version features a new capability: it will be able to fly by itself – piloted by AI. This technology could potentially be used in a passenger plane in instances when the pilots are unable to fly due to a fall in cabin pressure. This is the moment when AI would take over. AI is better than its human counterparts at weighing up a multitude of factors in a short space of time – and then calmly making the most appropriate decision without panicking.

To land a plane safely, AI must be able to correctly identify whether the terrain is suit-able for landing or whether what is in front of it is actually a body of water. The aircraft will be equipped with optical-recognition scanners and lasers for this purpose. The required algorithm is being developed and tested in collaboration with the German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence.

The initial THOR flight with AI at the controls is scheduled for the beginning of 2017. Konigorski is already convinced: “With AI on board we can make an important contribution to aviation safety,” he says.

THOR makes its maiden flight in Stade, Germany, on 21 November 2015

Choose your friends carefully

In addition to the work being carried out by Airbus engineers, Airbus Ventures, the venture capital fund set up by Airbus in Silicon Valley and Europe, is on the lookout for promising investment opportunities in this sector.

But the hype surrounding this topic doesn’t make it an easy task. “There are countless start-ups out there, all claiming to have the best AI solutions,” says Maryanna Saenko, investment partner at Airbus Ventures. “Some investors pump millions into these start-ups without knowing how the companies differentiate themselves, their approach to the market, or what the end result will likely be.”

Airbus Ventures is not one of them, explains the engineer and robotics specialist. Its team is only interested in those start-ups that operate in areas of strategic interest to the Group. This includes fields such as digital manufacturing, logistics, connected fleets and urban air mobility.

And just like other big technology companies, the Group is also investigating the value of using virtual assistants. After learning from blue collar workers on the shop floor, such helpers could make a difference to manufacturing and maintenance by providing assistance and even making recommendations. This is further evidence that Airbus is investing in a vision far removed from science fiction and AI hype – a vision where humans and AI together create solutions that guarantee more efficiency and safety in the aerospace sector.

Recent AI activity

Lars Thomsen predicts future trends – and doesn’t need a crystal ball to do this. Every year the futurologist travels around the world and interviews 400 experts in the field working on technologies that will shape our future. His speciality: artificial intelligence.



With your knowledge of what’s in the pipeline, is it worth investing in AI?

Absolutely. AI is set to cause major disruption in most industries over the next few decades: it will solve a whole series of problems that cannot be resolved today. AI can help interpret complex climate models and it can find ways of using raw materials in production, as well as natural resources such as water, more efficiently.

How far ahead can you foresee what will happen?

We’re talking about up to ten years into the future.

And will we have developed machines more intelligent than humans by the next decade?

That depends on the application. In ten years there will be self-driving cars that can drive better than most people, but does that make them more intelligent? No. In most branches of industry, the objective is to get machines to take care of time-consuming, routine tasks to enable us to concentrate on more important things. AI could, for example, read your emails and compile suggested replies while you are asleep. Then, when you wake up, all you have to do is press the ‘send’ button.

What is the potential for AI in the aerospace industry?

It’s vast. AI can increase safety in our overcrowded airspaces by supporting air traffic controllers. It can detect material defects in production and help to develop lighter aircraft with longer service lives that use less fuel. And it can improve the flight experience. We have all found ourselves sitting next to an interesting person on a flight. But these encounters don’t have to be left up to chance. Airlines can seat people whose profiles are compatible next to one another.

Do you think AI will fly planes one day?

It’s very likely that we will see self-flying parcel delivery UAVs in the next ten years. And if passenger planes can fly more safely with AI on board, we will be doing the same before long. We humans have an innate desire for innovation and we are forever striving to make our lives safer and more comfortable.

Airbus A380 hopes take a hit in Iran deal - USA TODAY,"Thu, 22 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90cmF2ZWwvZmxpZ2h0cy90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTYvMTIvMjIvYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtaG9wZXMtdGFrZS1oaXQtaXJhbi1kZWFsLzk1NzQ4MjMyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus A380 hopes take a hit in Iran deal

There will be no Airbus A380s for Iran Air, after all.

Iran’s firm order for 100 aircraft on Thursday was a major boost for European jetmaker Airbus. But while that deal – worth $16.6 billion at list prices – will help Airbus’ bottom line, it did nothing to improve concerns about the long-term viability of Airbus’ biggest plane: the A380.

Initially, a preliminary agreement between Iran and Airbus called for a 118-jet order that also included 12 of Airbus’ A380 superjumbo jet, the world’s largest passenger jet. But once the deal was finalized, the preliminary agreement was reduced to an order for 100 jets – and no A380s.

Speaking while negotiations were still under way earlier this week, Iran Air CEO Farhad Parvaresh told the state news agency IRNA that “the A380 planes have been dropped from this contract,"" according to Reuters. That decision was confirmed in the deal revealed Thursday.

Even though the Iran order was for only a dozen A380s, it was viewed as a much-needed boost for an aircraft that has struggled to win orders.

Thirteen airlines – none from North America – have ordered the A380 for their fleets. But it’s only Dubai-based Emirates that has given the aircraft more than a niche role in its overall network strategy. Emirates – by far the world’s biggest operator of the A380 – currently has about 90 of the jets in its fleet. That accounts for nearly half of all of the A380s delivered so far by Airbus.

And with no recent orders for the plane, many industry observers have wondered how much longer Airbus can keep the A380 product line going without new orders. Bloomberg News writes “Airbus has already cut production of its superjumbo by more than half, to one plane a month by 2018, as demand has dwindled.”

CNN also picks up on the theme, saying Iran Air’s possible A380 order “was seen as crucial for the future of the wide-body aircraft, which has struggled to find buyers.”

In addition to the 200 A380s already flying, CNN notes Airbus has “119 more orders lined up. That's way below the 1,200 orders Airbus said it expected when the aircraft was introduced in 2005.”

Among the planes cut from the deal are 12 double-decker A380 superjumbos.

This is troubling news for the beleaguered A380 superjumbo program.

The IranAir order would have been the A380's largest airline order since 2013.

Santiago, Chile,In early December, the Chilean Army took delivery of a tenth heavy-weight, twin-engine H215M, the last delivery in a project that began in 2008 with the purchase of eight of these helicopters, to which two more were added in 2013 and 2014 respectively. The new rotorcraft will serve alongside the previous nine in the Helicopter Battalion of the Chilean Army’s Air Brigade.Held at Airbus Helicopters’ facilities in Santiago, the handover ceremony was attended by General Humberto Oviedo Arriagada, the Commander in Chief of the Chilean Army; Brigadier-General Gustavo Núñez Kocher, the Commander of the Chilean Army’s Air Brigade; and Airbus Helicopters Chile General Manager, Alexandre Ceccacci, among other civil and military dignitaries.“This helicopter complements the army’s fleet, which now includes latest-generation aircraft with the ability to perform multiple missions across the entire country,” said Brigadier-General Núñez Kocher. “Our confidence in this helicopter is based on the positive operational results it has achieved since coming into service in 2009. The H215M has proved its versatility and reliability across the Army’s numerous and demanding operations.”The army’s H215M have completed more than 10,000 flight hours in a large number of missions that range from the provision of aid to remote areas and medical evacuations to firefighting and disaster relief. The Chilean Army’s Air Brigade played a crucial relief role during the floods that hit the Atacama region in 2015, carrying out 56 missions to provide support for flood victims.“This project owes its success to the involvement of both parties and the relationship of trust that exists between them,” said Alexandre Ceccacci. “I would like to thank the army for all their support. It will be an honor to continue working together in the support of these aircraft as well as in other projects to come. Airbus Helicopters can be proud of the Air Brigade’s ten H215M, and I can assure you that we will be working hard to ensure they continue delivering high-value capability.”In addition to the ten H215Ms, the Chilean Army operates a number of other Airbus Helicopters rotorcraft, such as the single-engine AS350B3, the twin-engine AS355NP and the Puma SA330L.The H215—and its military version, the H215M—forms part of the Super Puma family. It boasts multi-mission capabilities and delivers optimum performance in extreme operating conditions. Combining modern avionics with a proven, robust platform the H215M offers long-range capabilities, power, speed and a large useful payload; making it the ideal aircraft to perform SAR missions. The H215 is also reliable and highly economical, with an availability rate of more than 95 percent.The helicopters of the Super Puma family serve with the armed forces of more than 43 countries around the world. There are more than 100 helicopters from the family operating in Latin America alone, in virtually every country of the region. Their ability to operate in both high & hot conditions and jungle environments means they can rise to the operational challenges the region poses, particularly in the Andes and its high plateau, which have their own unique environment in terms of altitude and temperature.Airbus Helicopters, a division of Airbus Group, provides the most efficient civil and military helicopter solutions worldwide.

Alaska Air must decide fate of Virgin America's Airbus jets - USA TODAY,"Tue, 27 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdHJhdmVsL2ZsaWdodHMvdG9kYXlpbnRoZXNreS8yMDE2LzEyLzI3L2FsYXNrYS1haXItbXVzdC1kZWNpZGUtZmF0ZS12aXJnaW4tYW1lcmljYXMtYWlyYnVzLWpldHMvOTU4ODI2NDQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Alaska Air must decide fate of Virgin America's Airbus jets

SEATTLE -- The merger of Alaska Airlines and Virgin America brings an interesting new dynamic that Seattle-based Alaska now must navigate: a fleet of jetliners from two different aerospace giants.

Alaska Airlines' mainline fleet consists solely of Boeing 737s. Emblazoned on the nose of each are these words: ""Proudly all Boeing."" However, merger partner Virgin America flies Airbus A320s, the family of planes from Boeing rival Airbus that are a direct competitor to the 737 line.

""So we'll be a two fleet airline. We'll have Airbus airplanes at Virgin America. We'll have Boeing at Alaska,"" says Alaska Air CEO Brad Tilden. ""And I think like any business, we're going to take a few months time and we'll sit down with both manufacturers in the months ahead and talk to them about 'Is it better for us to move to an all Boeing fleet on the Virgin side, or is it better for us to continue to operate these two fleet types?'""

Different airlines take different approaches to their fleets. Southwest only flies the 737. With more than 700 jets, it's the fourth largest airline in the country by fleet size. Delta, with more than 800 planes, flies ten different types of jets.

For Alaska, what makes the most sense?

""That's a logical business process that we need to go through and we will go through it in the months ahead,"" said Tilden.

Different planes can limit an airline's flexibility. Most airline pilots are only certified to fly one type of plane at a time. They can -- and do -- switch, but that involves additional training and cost. Mechanics also need to keep more spare parts on hand.

The biggest addition for Alaska in all this is a larger footprint in California. But Tilden says there was a time when the company didn't think it was going to fly to Hawaii as it does now. Nor did it think it would fly east of the Rocky Mountains, much less to New York or Florida and, soon, Cuba.

Airbus and Local Motors Complete the Cargo Drone Challenge - Commercial UAV News,"Thu, 15 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbW1lcmNpYWx1YXZuZXdzLmNvbS9pbmZyYXN0cnVjdHVyZS9haXJidXMtbG9jYWwtbW90b3JzLWNvbXBsZXRlLWNhcmdvLWRyb25lLWNoYWxsZW5nZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In early 2016, Airbus, the giant European aerospace company, and Local Motors, a USA-based company that operates a growing global network of microfactories, launched the Cargo Drone Challenge.

Until now, Airbus had focused all of their drone efforts in a military context, but with this initiative, Airbus seems to be sending a message to the market that it is ready to enter the commercial space.

The rules were simple and the objectives clear: to design a safe, easy to operate and affordable UAV solution adaptable for many different civil applications. The winner had to present a drone that allows for simple reconfigurations, in a safe and effective manner, for uses such as agriculture monitoring, infrastructure inspection, cargo delivery and/or humanitarian missions.

More specific requirements of the challenge were the ability to take off and land vertically and to have a considerable moving forward speed, so a pusher propeller was encouraged. The payload was specified at a minimum of 2.5 Kg (5.5 lbs) with a range of at least 100 kms (62 miles).

By May 22, the official deadline for submissions, 423 entries were received and after a period of validation and voting, three winners were declared for first, second and third place.

Zelator-28 , a powerful UAV from the Russian designer Alexey Medvedev, was selected as the winner of the competition for its unique combination of speed, hauling capacity and VTOL capabilities. The design offers a powerful push engine which provides a forward thrust in the flight, but it was also chosen for its fastness and the presence of four smaller rotors which give a vertical lift. The modular cargo bay is easily loaded and guarantees fast turnaround deliveries.

In second place, Volans by California-based engineer Harvest Zhang found a very similar solution to the cargo challenge by placing four rotors aroud the center of the gravity and providing a pusher propeller for speed in vertical flight.

In third place the judges selected Minerva from D.F. Finger in Germany. This unique design offer a twin boom layout in which some of the heavier components are placed in these elongated structures thus reducing the wing root bending moment and helping reduce the weight of the wing structure.

What these three revolutionary designs have in common is that all four rotors which allow vertical take offs and landings are placed symmetrically in a square configuration around the center of gravity and all three models have a pusher propeller. That’s not to say these are any of the entries were especially similar though. In a recent interview , CEO & Co-founder of Local Motors Jay Roger mentioned that the variety they saw in the contest was incredible. “No two drones looked the same, and it was inspiring to see how big our community members can dream when given an outlet and an opportunity,” he said.

Perhaps the aircraft design community that helped select these three contestants from the 423 submissions received are signaling something in terms of load factor and flight efficiency. One thing is clear, though, there is an incredible amount of talent out there in aeronautical design and the partnership of these resources with well established companies like Airbus and Local Motors will surely result in revolutionary designs and optimization of current technology.

Congratulations to all three winners and to Airbus and Local Motors for the initiative.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9918020367622375}",neutral,0.9918020367622375,0
Iran to land first Airbus jet within weeks under sanctions pact - CNBC,"Mon, 19 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMTYvMTIvMTkvaXJhbi10by1sYW5kLWZpcnN0LWFpcmJ1cy1qZXQtd2l0aGluLXdlZWtzLXVuZGVyLXNhbmN0aW9ucy1wYWN0Lmh0bWzSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAxNi8xMi8xOS9pcmFuLXRvLWxhbmQtZmlyc3QtYWlyYnVzLWpldC13aXRoaW4td2Vla3MtdW5kZXItc2FuY3Rpb25zLXBhY3QuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Iran expects to get its first new jet within weeks under a multi-billion-dollar deal with Airbus for 100 planes, a senior official said on Monday, as Tehran and Western firms race to reopen trade almost a year after sanctions were lifted.



The first of the Airbus jets should be delivered in mid-January, part of plans to buy or lease 200 planes to renew IranAir's decaying fleet, against a backdrop of conservative criticism in both Washington and Tehran of last year's international sanctions deal to allow such business.

Sanctions were lifted in January but were followed by months of regulatory delays, and Iran has only just finalized a deal to buy 80 jets from Airbus' U.S. rival Boeing .

""We have finalized negotiations with Airbus and any day we will be able to sign the deal in Tehran,"" Deputy Roads and Urban Development Minister Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan told Reuters in a telephone interview. ""We are expecting some final clearances and expect to sign today or tomorrow.""

The first Airbus A321 could arrive before the Jan. 20 inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who has opposed the deal to lift most sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear activities, and well ahead of Iranian presidential elections in May next year.

That could provide a boost to the government of President Hassan Rouhani and allow Airbus to find a home for some jets abandoned or deferred by other customers due to economic problems in South America and elsewhere, analysts say.

Airbus, which has revised up its forecasts for Iranian domestic demand, said it was still negotiating the IranAir deal. The airline sees itself as a future rival to Gulf-based super-carriers due to its geographical position.

Initial plans to buy a dozen A380 superjumbos were dropped after criticism from Iranian hardliners. Kashan said the deal with Airbus will be split roughly equally between narrow-body jets including the A320 and A321 and wide-body jets including the A330 and A350.

Pact 'violation' warning

Such deals are also under fire from U.S. Republicans.

President Barack Obama's outgoing administration has granted licences to allow the sales, a step required by both Airbus and Boeing due to the use of U.S. parts, but analysts say completing them depends in part on Washington's new political climate.

Asked whether either deal could be derailed if Trump imposes new restrictions on trade with Iran, Kashan said: ""We are not concerned, although we should not ignore such a possibility.

""The fact is that Mr Trump may impose certain new sanctions, but we would consider that to be a violation of the JCPOA (nuclear accord), which explicitly provides for the possibility for the purchase of aircraft and their sale by manufacturers.""

Kashan also dismissed suggestions by some Republicans that Iran could misuse civil jetliners for military purposes such as ferrying arms and fighters to Syria or elsewhere.

""This has not been the case and will not be the case. These accusations are not based on reality and are propaganda against the Iranian society and people,"" he said.

Still, doubts remain over financing due to uncertainty over Trump's policy towards Iran and the reluctance by either Western or Iranian governments to provide financial guarantees.

Most Western commercial banks remain unwilling to get involved, fearing fines or commercial problems in the United States if relations between Washington and Tehran deteriorate.

Iran has reached agreements with at least two foreign leasing firms to finance a total of 77 jets, including 42 from Airbus and 35 from Boeing, Kashan said.

Those companies will arrange finance leases, a form of funding which is closer to a purchase than a standard rental.

Western export credit agencies will not be involved in either the Airbus or Boeing deal, Kashan added.

Also complicating implementation are core U.S. sanctions preventing Iran's use of the U.S. financial system.

Aircraft are usually paid for in dollars but France-based Airbus will receive euros.

Kashan said all the transactions would use foreign currencies initially, but that Boeing would ultimately receive its income in U.S. dollars.

People familiar with the deal say Boeing has U.S. approval allowing it to go ahead on this basis for 15 777-300ERs but that it will need renewed approvals for the remaining 65 aircraft.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9975435137748718}",neutral,0.9975435137748718,0

Airbus Helicopters' UK headquarters to begin aircraft completion work



Ascent Flight Tr

The H135 Juno and the H145 Jupiter, the first two aircraft in the 32-strong fleet of the UK Military Flying Training System (UKMFTS) helicopters, can be seen together for the first time, marking the start of a new era in helicopter military flight training in the UK.

Flown over from the Airbus Helicopters’ manufacturing site in Donauworth, Germany, G-CJIW H135 Juno aircraft joins the G-CJIV H145 Jupiter which was the first UKMFTS helicopter to arrive in Britain, landing at the company’s UK headquarters at Oxford Airport. The H145 Jupiter is currently being operated by a joint military and civilian fielding team in support of the UKMFTS programme and for which the first three pilots have now completed their H145 type ratings. The first H135 Juno will enter a short programme of modification to meet specific UKMFTS training requirements before being operated by the UKMFTS fielding team.The aircraft will allow UK armed forces to benefit from conducting initial training on a twin-engine, full glass cockpit aircraft; thus reducing the time needed to retrain once in contact with frontline helicopters. Furthermore, the H135 and H145 family of aircraft, equipped with Airbus Helicopters advanced avionics suite Helionix, provides for a much improved flight and safety envelope.Air Vice-Marshal Andy Turner, Air Officer commanding 22 Group responsible for flying training, said, “These state of the art Airbus Helicopters aircraft will be the perfect starting point for the next generation of battlefield helicopter aircrew. With all of the latest technology in autopilot, stability, navigation and communication systems, they will allow training to stretch our people further, earlier and quicker making them better all-round aircrew”.Ian Morris, Head of UK Defence Business at Airbus Helicopters, said, “The H135 and H145 are proven multirole helicopters in both civil and military segments and have become the aircraft of choice for military flying training across the globe. The latest Helionix versions provide a level of technology which mirrors that on UK front line aircraft, ensuring all future UK military student pilots and crewmen can make the best possible transition from training to operations.With all UK armed forces helicopter pilots of the last 35 years having trained on Airbus aircraft, staff at Airbus Helicopters are proud to continue this heritage and continue supporting UK Armed Forces helicopter training at least for the next 18 years. Airbus Helicopters has steadily increased its capacity with a clear objective: to ensure that the UK armed forces can benefit from the high quality training experience that is possible with these superb modern aircraft. Full service training delivery is due to begin on 1 April 2018, an auspicious date given it is the 100th Anniversary of the Royal Air Force.To meet this, key infrastructure work is progressing well at RAF Shawbury and RAF Valley, home to the UKMFTS rotary wing system, while teams of pilots, engineers, planners and instructors have already been fully engaged with the Ascent fielding team, ensuring that skills and capability are ramped up in preparation for the significant deadline.Airbus Helicopters has been present in the United Kingdom for 40 years and is the UK’s largest helicopter supplier with approximately 400 aircraft operating in civil, military and emergency services roles. The company’s site at Oxford Airport is home to Britain’s Civil Helicopter Hub while sites at Aberdeen, Belfast and Hawarden support our customers across the breadth of the British Isles.Airbus Helicopters, a division of Airbus Group, provides the most efficient civil and military helicopter solutions worldwide. Its in-service fleet includes nearly 12,000 helicopters operated by more than 3,000 customers in 154 countries.

Known as Clean Sky, this major initiative aims to review the thousands of components used in current aircraft and helicopters to identify areas that can be significantly improved.

One of the EU’s largest and most ambitious innovation projects, Clean Sky’s current phase involves 600 organisations from 24 countries and has a budget of over €4 billion. Airbus is one of the 16 industry leaders involved. “It can take up to 10 years to test and mature safe, efficient and reliable technologies to build new aircraft, and Clean Sky provides the right framework to do just that,” explains Jens Koenig, coordinator of Airbus research and technology for the Clean Sky project.

Powering up the future

The project’s flagship is a new large passenger airliner that incorporates significant changes compared to the models passengers fly in now. Its most striking feature is 2 large open rotor engines, constituted of 2 rows of contra-rotating propellers that are positioned at the end of the fuselage.

While this configuration considerably reduces fuel consumption, it requires changes to the fuselage design and to the position and shape of the wings. Due to the challenges this concept poses, very large ultra-high bypass ratio turbofan engines for next generation aircraft are also being developed in parallel as an alternative.

Cutting the drag

Another area of exploration is possible ways to reduce aircraft drag. This is the aim of BLADE, a project headed by Airbus to design a new kind of laminar wing that displaces turbulence “as far as possible from the wing’s leading edge,” in the words of project leader Daniel Kierbel.

By modifying the shape, materials and surface of the wings, fuel consumption can be reduced by 4.6%. “That may not seem like much, but when it’s multiplied by the potential number of short-range aircraft currently in operation around the world, it starts to become really significant,” he points out.

In a hangar in Tarbes, France, an Airbus A340-300 has literally had its outer wings cut off. This test aircraft is one of 2 ‘Flight Labs’ provided by Airbus to test high potential technologies being developed within Clean Sky. The outer wings of Flight Lab 2 will be replaced with 2 types of laminar wings, one on each side. Geometrically identical, each one is based on a different structural concept.

The team aims to perform the first test flight in the second half of 2017 and, according to Kierbel, these types of technologies could be incorporated into commercial aircraft in the near future. Another visible difference is that these new wings have fewer fasteners on the upper covers than traditional ones. “This helps them achieve a better laminar flow, thanks to their smoother surface,” Kierbel explains.

BLADE demonstrator

Pilots at heart

""One of our aims is to reduce pilot workload by creating new automatic systems that reconfigure the aircraft in the event of a failure"", says Miguel Llorca, Head of military aircraft research and development at Airbus Defence and Space.



To bring down transport costs and further reduce CO2 emissions, there is also a need for new regional aircraft with seating for around 100 passengers. New prototypes developed by Airbus Defence and Space introduce wing structure changes and flight physics optimisation to reduce aircraft weight and fuel consumption as well as changes to the flight cabin and aircraft handling – all of which will be tested on a C295-P1.

Airbus Defence and Space leads the project to modify the structure of the new aircraft, which will also be equipped with turboprops. “We’re also exploring new systems that allow pilots to give orders to the aircraft through voice recognition, or presenting flight information to pilots through light head-mounted displays such as Google glasses,” says Llorca.

Electrical innovations

On-board electronics is another area with great potential for improvement. Recently, Airbus’ Flight Lab 1 – involving a consortium of 9 companies and institutions in 5 countries – performed flight tests for 5 new innovative electrical technologies mounted on an A320.

These technologies included a new air intakewith protection against ice build-up during flight, a new air conditioning system that draws air from the exterior and not from the engines as in current systems, and various other electronic systems that significantly reduce the noise levels generated by conventional devices.

“This year we’ve completed more than 300 hours of ground tests and 27 hours of flight tests using a total of 400 sensors and 18,000 new parts. It’s been a resounding success and we have learned a lot that we can apply going forward,” explains project leader Jonathan Rigaud.

Electrical innovations Flight Lab

A new breed of aircraft

The consortium is also exploring potential civil applications for new hybrid helicopters based on Airbus Helicopters’ X3. These aircraft combine the hover flight characteristic of helicopters with the speed of a passenger aircraft, reaching speeds 50% faster than conventional helicopters.

‘Green rotors’ also significantly reduce engine noise and cost per passenger. One of the programme’s objectives is to adapt these new aircraft to civil uses, particularly search and rescue and emergencies. “The hybrid concept allows us to extend the radius of action by 50%, resulting in substantial economic benefits for operators as they can allow themselves to have fewer bases and fewer aircraft – not to mention how many lives they can save in time,” explains Tomasz Krysinski, head of research and innovation at Airbus Helicopters.

Airbus Helicopters' high-speed hybrid helicopter

From research to reality

This current phase of the project, Clean Sky 2, is reviewing and improving practically every component, every manufacturing stage and every use being made of aircraft. For example, one project is exploring the concept of ‘talking’ aircraft that provide continuous updates of their technical status, which could lead to a reduction in the number of routine checks and their cost.



Another concept set to change is the idea that an aircraft should be made up of thousands of different parts with a complex configuration of cables in its interior that needs to be connected in the assembly hangars.

""We’re looking to design the fuselage of the future, with much more automated production"", says Koenig. Clean Sky 2 is currently developing all these and other technologies with a view to their incorporation into commercial aircraft by 2025. Koenig considers that the changes, although gradual, will be important: “When you think about the aircraft of the future, people tend to imagine something like the Starship Enterprise. In reality, we think they’ll be quite similar to current aircraft with wings and engines, but much quieter and much more efficient.”

Airbus has agreed a series of deals with advanced manufacturing company, Arconic, who will supply the aircraft manufacturer with 3D-printed metal components for its commercial planes.

Arconic will supply 3D-printed parts made from high temperature nickel superalloys and 3D printed titanium airframe parts in two separate deals.

These recent agreements build on prior dealings from earlier in the year. In April, Arconic agreed to supply 3D-printed titanium fuselage and engine pylon components for Airbus’ commercial aircraft.

“We’re proud to deepen our partnership with Airbus through these agreements,” said Klaus Kleinfeld, Chairman and CEO of Arconic. “Airbus’ confidence in our additive manufacturing capabilities is grounded in Arconic’s comprehensive strengths – from aerospace know-how to metals powder production and product qualification expertise. We are pleased to support our customers and pave the way to the future of aerospace manufacturing.”

Arconic will supply 3D-printed ducting components for the A320 family of aircraft. Advanced nickel superalloys, which will be used to produce the components, will offer superior heat resistance. This will allow for hot air to be transmitted from the aero engine to other parts of the airframe.

Under a second deal, but for the same family of aircraft, Arconic will supply 3D-printed titanium airframe brackets, also for the A320 platform. Arconic is expecting to deliver the first set of parts for both agreements in the second quarter of 2017.

Meanwhile, Airbus has further increased its additive manufacturing potential by installing a Sciaky Electron Beam Additive Manufacturing (EBAM) 110 System. Sciaky’s EBAM process utilises a fully articulated, electron beam gun to deposit metal via wire feedstock, layer by layer, until the part reaches near net-shape.

The system accommodates titanium, tantalum, niobium, stainless steels, among other metals and refractory alloys, with gross deposition rates from 7-20lbs of metal per hour. Offering a work envelope of 70” x 47” x 63” in a 110” cube chamber, the EBAM 110 will extend the range of parts available to be printed.

""Sciaky is very proud to partner with a world-class innovator like Airbus,"" said Bob Phillips, VP of marketing for Sciaky Inc. ""We all know that metal 3D printing technology is going to revolutionise manufacturing in the aerospace industry and Sciaky is committed to being at the forefront of this movement.""","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8472398519515991}",positive,0.8472398519515991,1

Airbus forced to postpone delivery of 12 A380 jets to Emirates - The Guardian,"Wed, 28 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDE2L2RlYy8yOC9haXJidXMtZm9yY2VkLXRvLXBvc3Rwb25lLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LW9mLTEyLWEzODAtamV0cy10by1lbWlyYXRlc9IBb2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDE2L2RlYy8yOC9haXJidXMtZm9yY2VkLXRvLXBvc3Rwb25lLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LW9mLTEyLWEzODAtamV0cy10by1lbWlyYXRlcw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has suffered yet another hitch in the troubled life of its A380 “superjumbo”, as it was forced to postpone delivery of 12 aircraft to its largest customer, Emirates.

The double-decker A380, the world’s largest passenger jet, has proved a disappointment for Airbus since its much-delayed debut in 2007 and the firm has already been forced to cut production after winning fewer orders than expected.

The latest obstacle to throw the €25bn (£21bn) aircraft programme off course has left analysts questioning whether executives at Airbus might consider cancelling it altogether.

The Toulouse-based aviation firm said it would delay delivery to Emirates of six jets due to arrive next year until 2018, with a further six put back from 2018 to 2019.

The postponement is said to be linked to technical issues Emirates is having with the new Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines it has ordered for its fleet of A380s.

It comes days after Airbus revealed that an order from Iran Air for 100 planes, some of which were expected to be A380s, did not include the aircraft at all.

Airbus developed the A380, which can carry 850 passengers, believing that airlines would turn to larger jets to feed more people through hub airports serving a growing number of “megacities”.

This vision of the future prompted the firm – part-owned by the French, German and Spanish governments – to predict huge demand for the giant twin-aisle, four-engine planes.

Despite cost overruns and long delays that cost several executives their jobs, the jet eventually took to the skies for its first public flight in 2007 to great acclaim from its early passengers.

But stagnant economic growth and a lack of orders from countries such as the US and Japan have forced Airbus to rein in production.

It has delivered just 193 superjumbos and has only a further 126 orders left to fulfil, having initially predicted demand for 1,200 over two decades.

At the same time, smaller but longer range twin-engine jets with large cargo capacity – such as Boeing’s 777 – have proved popular because airlines see them as less risky economically.

John Strickland, a veteran aviation industry analyst and director of JLS Consulting, said the A380 was well-liked but that there had not been a sufficient market for it so far.

“It’s regarded as a fantastic aircraft by the airlines that have taken it. [IAG chief executive] Willie Walsh has praised it, [Emirates chief executive] Tim Clark has praised it. They say passengers even choose it, asking to go on an A380 if there’s a choice.

“But these days, given the economic climate, airlines are more risk-averse and the A380 has a lot of seats to fill.”

Airbus has said that it can break even at an annual production rate of 20 A380s, which carry an order book price of $430m but are typically sold at a discount.

It beat this target in 2015, with 27 rolling off the production line, but a slowdown in orders forced the company to slash scheduled annual deliveries to just 12 from 2018. The firm is also cutting costs to make up for the shortfall in income.

Strickland said Airbus now faced a difficult decision over whether to continue making the jet at a loss in the hope that its patience would be rewarded within a few years.

“So the question is whether Airbus can get through this challenging period to the brighter future which they envision, where airlines are falling over themselves to get hold of larger planes,” he said.

“They will have to keep it under continuous review because it’s a commercially driven business, even though it’s government-owned.

“They have many other calls on their investment. At the moment it’s a greater risk to throw in the towel, but there’s a challenge of how to maintain very low levels of production if you’re actually losing money.”

The aviation analyst Alex Macheras said the A380 was highly popular with passengers and had created an “overall feeling that this is what all modern day airliners should feel like”.

But he also cast doubt on how long Airbus could remain loyal to the aircraft, which was conceived and developed before the tenure of the current chief executive, Tom Enders.

“There is the sad reality that not enough airlines are ordering A380s to keep the production alive for as long as Airbus would have liked,” said Macheras.

“Emirates are taking the majority of the remaining A380s on order, and so with a delay to their deliveries, it doesn’t leave a demand for many A380 air frames for other carriers.”

But he said Airbus could take solace from the potential success story of its new A350-1000 plane, which is due to enter service next year.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9999611377716064}",negative,0.9999611377716064,-1
Iran finalizes $18b deal for 100 planes from Airbus - The Times of Israel,"Thu, 22 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzb2Zpc3JhZWwuY29tL2lyYW4tZmluYWxpemVzLTE4Yi1kZWFsLWZvci0xMDAtcGxhbmVzLWZyb20tYWlyYnVzL9IBVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzb2Zpc3JhZWwuY29tL2lyYW4tZmluYWxpemVzLTE4Yi1kZWFsLWZvci0xMDAtcGxhbmVzLWZyb20tYWlyYnVzL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Airbus and Iran Air finalized Thursday a deal for 100 planes worth more than $18 billion at list prices — a contract that’s potentially a big boost for Iran’s post-sanctions economy.

Under the terms of the deal, which was initially announced in January, Airbus said deliveries are expected to begin early next year.

The contract includes single-aisle A320 and A330 jets and wide-body A350 XWB planes.

As well as further modernizing Iran’s aviation fleet, which has been hobbled by years of sanctions, the deal is a boon to Airbus too as Iran’s flag carrier had finalized a deal for 80 jetliners from US plane maker Boeing Co. — Airbus’ key rival — earlier this month. In addition to providing the planes, Airbus is to help Iran Air with pilot training, assist with airport operations and air traffic management.

The Boeing agreement was the biggest Iran has struck with an American company since the 1979 revolution and US Embassy takeover. The Boeing planes are scheduled to start arriving in 2018.

The deals were made possible after the US and other world powers agreed last year to lift the sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear activities.

“We hope this success signals to the world that the commercial goals of Iran and its counterparts are better achieved with international cooperation and collaboration,” Iran Air Chairman and CEO Farhad Parvaresh was quoted as saying of the Airbus deal.

President-elect Donald Trump and several Republican lawmakers have criticized the nuclear deal, but it’s unclear whether they would scrap it.

Most of Iran’s aging fleet of 250 commercial planes was purchased before 1979, and as of June only 162 were operational, with the rest grounded because of a lack of spare parts. Iran has said it is looking to buy 400 passenger planes over the next decade.

For Airbus, Iran Air has finalised an agreement for 100 aircraft that is broadly split between narrowbodies (A320 and A321) and widebodies (A330 and A350). The A380 is no longer included. The industry was excited to see a new-build A321 in Iran Air colours at an Airbus plant awaiting delivery, likely in Jan-2017.

Iran Air's first new-build Boeing delivery is expected in 2018. Iran Air has agreed to 80 aircraft, comprising 50 737 MAX 8s, 15 777-300ERs and 15 777-9s. At least two undisclosed leasing companies will finance 77 aircraft, including 42 from Airbus and 35 from Boeing, according to Reuters.

Iran Air would take delivery of an ageing A380 with uncertain spare parts and support

Putting aside whether or not Iran Air would have sustainable markets for the A380, there is the matter of the aircraft's age. Iran Air's A380s were tentatively scheduled for delivery from 2020 to 2022. The A380 was designed in the late 1990s/early 2000s, meaning Iran Air would take delivery of an aircraft with a 20-year-old design lacking any significant upgrade.

As of Dec-2016 74% of all A380s expected (in CAPA's Fleet Database) to be built in the programme's lifetime have already been delivered. In 2017 the assembly will be completed of 85% of all projected A380s; a revival on any scale looks unlikely.

A380 production by year of manufacture (completed/projected): 2006-2020

Assuming a first delivery in 2020, Iran Air would receive its first A380 when 20% of the global A380 fleet would be over 10 years old and facing retirement in the coming years. This includes aircraft, such as at Singapore Airlines and Emirates, that will likely be retired before 2020 and either broken up or possibly re-leased, but the figures are oversimplified for clarity.

Again assuming a 2020 delivery, within a few years of operating the A380 Iran Air would have seen a marked change in the type's age distribution: in 2025 69% of A380s would be 10-20 years old and facing retirement. By the time Iran Air's A380s would have around a normal half-life, in 2030 there would be only a handful of other A380s under 10 years old.

Besides the direct financial concern of operating an old-design aircraft, support and spare parts would gradually become an issue for what is already a relatively low volume production aircraft - although obviously Airbus would take steps to ensure supply.

There could be further challenges since most of the support and spare part industry will be focused around Emirates, which for competitive reasons may not regard it as being in its interest to help Iran Air attain good commercial deals for A380 support.

A380 global fleet age assuming all aircraft remain in service: 2020-2030

Singapore Airlines, Emirates and Qantas prepare some A380s for retirement

The A380's initial three operators - Singapore Airlines, Emirates and Qantas - are preparing to phase out some or all of their A380s.

Launch operator Singapore Airlines last took delivery of an A380 in 2012. That was SIA's 19th, and last from its first tranche. A follow-up order was made for five A380s - two for delivery in 2017 and three in 2018. These aircraft will feature new premium class products (business class seat and first class suite) and be retrofitted to the A380s that will remain in SIA's fleet.

SIA has updated its business and first class seats for the 777-300ER and retrofitted it to all -300ERs. The business class seat is also used on SIA's A350-900 (which does not have first class). But the A380 was not targeted in this product cycle and consequently the on-board product is ageing.

SIA's A380s average a still fairly young 7.5 years old, slightly under its total average fleet age of 7.9 years for the mainline operation (excluding SilkAir). SIA has elected not to renew leases on its initial A380s. Although this was seen as a blow to the A380 second-hand market, it was always unlikely for these aircraft to have their leases extended since they are some of the earliest A380s Airbus built, and have production inefficiencies owing to the early, difficult stage of A380 manufacturing.

See related report: A380 fleet profile: Emirates prepares for 615 seat configuration. SIA will dispose of early models

Emirates plans to replace its oldest A380s with new-order A380s; it does not plan to operate 140 A380s at the same time - or any sum near that. Although Emirates expects that its aircraft, which are well utilised, will be scrapped rather than reallocated, for its leased fleet that will be a decision for lessors. Whereas SIA has 10-year leases on its initial A380s, Emirates has 12-year leases, which mean its A380s only start to come off lease in 2020.

Discussion of a re-engined A380 - the so-called A380neo - appears to have ended, causing some frustration at Emirates. Emirates was the only audible proponent of the aircraft type but Airbus was hesitant on Emirates' overall volume order, as well as that order being dependent on one operator (more so than Airbus is with the current A380). It is unclear whether forgoing the A380neo could hurt Airbus' chances as Emirates weighs an A350/787 order.

At CAPA's Australia Pacific Aviation Summit in Brisbane in Aug-2016 Qantas CEO Alan Joyce stated clearly the long-held assumption that Qantas would not take delivery of the eight A380s it has postponed. Qantas operates 12 A380s and struggles to identify other markets large enough to fill the aircraft before turning to the matter of a profitable operation.

Qantas is eager to be at the forefront of its A380 replacement, which it sees occurring around 2020-2025. Qantas fell behind on 747 retirement but is managing to pull the aircraft through due to strategy (a product upgrade) and unanticipated luck (the rapid fall of fuel prices, easing the 747's fuel burn).

Qantas is weighing Boeing's 777X and Airbus' A350 family. A new stretched version of the A350 is under consideration, and Qantas does need to reach terms with Airbus about the A380s it does not intend to take delivery of. Boeing is eager to have Qantas finally operate the 777, and in hindsight Qantas now regrets not selecting the 777-300ER. When Qantas made its major refleeting decision at the turn of the century the 777-300ER had specifications far below what it ended up with, and Qantas was still very conservative about operating twin-engined aircraft for ultra-long haul flying. The airline also secured a very good deal for making such a large order at a time when Airbus needed the sale.

Outlook: Iran Air was never to be the A380's saviour

2016 starts and ends with no Iran Air A380. The A380 was included in Iran Air's initial agreement in early 2016. But as the buzz and excitement of Iranian aviation growth normalises and the focus turns to details, financials and ultimately profitability, it is not surprising to see the A380 order not being finalised. At the very least, both Airbus and Iran Air probably received more attention from the possibility of the A380 than they would have otherwise. The door will of course remain open for an order, but from Iran Air's planning perspective, prudency dictates watching how the market evolves, as long haul smaller widebody routes attract much attention - see for example: Qantas' first 787 routes, Perth-London nonstop and Melbourne-LA, address urgent strategic needs

For Airbus this is not a major setback. Besides Iran Air being a late prospective A380 order - it was always uncertain. With an order of only 12, the deal was not going to be the saviour for the A380 programme in any case. And with no other major deals (ANA is too small) or immediate prospects, there was not a chance of an Iran Air A380 order contributing to a new lease of life for the A380.

The A380 programme finds itself back where it was, while Iran Air is marching towards revitalisation - all in all, a practical outcome.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999815225601196}",neutral,0.9999815225601196,0

Building just one aircraft requires the participation of thousands of suppliers large and small. And, as manufacturers come to rely more heavily on external partners for larger portions of the plane, the challenge of coordinating all of those elements becomes greater than ever.

Airbus oversees a global supply chain of more than 7,800 suppliers from around the world. Each of those partners has a role to play in helping the company to meet production targets and fill customer orders, which currently equate to 10 years of production.

Some suppliers, though, are more critical than others. To prevent disruptions that could bring production to a halt, the company needs to know which ones are likely to have the greatest impact on operations. It must assess their individual levels of stability and maturity, and be prepared to take action based on that knowledge.

Given the fact that 80 percent of an aircraft’s content is procured, maximum supply-chain efficiency is key. Often that requires continual, direct contact with vendors. James Snow, head of supplier development for Airbus, oversees a team of 100 consultants who spend the lion’s share of their time onsite with suppliers.

Technology, especially in the age of the digital supply chain, is equally important. To keep tabs on the supplier base, and generate active intelligence on its reliability, Airbus has developed what it calls a digital control room.

The tool replaces the traditional paper-based method of supplier monitoring with technology that allows for rapid access to information throughout the Airbus supply-chain network. It connects operational teams scattered around the globe, and cuts back sharply on e-mail traffic and redundant reporting.

The old control room focused on Airbus’s top 80 suppliers, providing a quick scan as to where the manufacturer should be focusing its energies, says Snow. That method worked well enough, especially during ramp-up of production for the A320 in 2014. But then came the order from top management: replicate the practice for Airbus’s entire supply chain, and do it digitally.

Production on the Rise

Given the company’s ambitious plans for expanding production, maximum efficiency and control of the supplier base was crucial. Airbus was increasing production of the A320 from 42 to 50 aircraft per month, and there was talk of hitting 60. Then there’s the A350, the company’s newest product, which it plans to turn out at the rate of 13 per month within the coming year. In all, Airbus’s order backlog amounts to more than 6,800 aircraft.

For the first time, the digital control room links operational teams domiciled worldwide. With the help of a visual intuitive system, built on a web-based platform, it provides for the real-time flow of information.

Each Airbus supplier is furnished with a unique ID card, tied to every activity that the vendor performs for the manufacturer. The control room itself is designed in the form of a visual management board, with multiple “zones” that report on supplier activity and status. Each object to be monitored is represented by a digital card, created by the user in the process of reporting key actions. The card is updated as long as the relevant topic remains open. It’s deleted when the action plan is closed.

Cards can be filtered according to multiple criteria, including aircraft program, procurement domain, degree of topic criticality, and supplier site. A color code, signaling “good,” “bad,” “critical” or “unknown,” allows Airbus to see at a glance the progress and status of any given action.

The tool includes the ability to perform a rapid “health check,” lasting between 10 and 15 minutes, which assesses a targeted supplier site based on predefined criteria. In the process, Airbus can quickly identify any stress points, risk factors or weaknesses in the supplier’s operation.

Airbus evaluates four factors related to its suppliers: their overall performance, industry capacity, industry maturity and industrial risk. Together they help the manufacturer to assess suppliers’ ability to keep pace with the heavy demand that Airbus is working to satisfy.

Collaboration, Not Talk

Under the old system, says Snow, teams would show up on site in the case of a potential problem, “but would spend far too much time trying to explain what the issue was, and not enough time working with suppliers.” Now, Airbus is better able to identify hotspots, plant issues and the need for escalating corrective action.

Across its supply chain, Airbus today can ensure that its supplier-development teams are focused on the right mission. They concentrate on eight key skills: recovery, transfer of work, advanced product quality planning (APQP) and Six Sigma quality benchmarks, problem solving, operations management, lean supply chains, industry assessment and capacity assessment.

“The tool shows where people are, what they’re working on, and whether they’re aligned with top management,” says Snow.

The primary benefit of the digital control room, he says, is “global trust.” Through a tool that’s available to users around the clock, Airbus gains unprecedented transparency of its suppliers and production activities. The latest updates, as well as necessary actions, are available for all to see.

The digital control room simplifies the process of supplier management, Snow says. Airbus’s internal reporting workload has been reduced by more than 50 percent. Some 1,200 active users have replaced formal meetings with more direct supplier collaboration. Faster decision-making allows Airbus to keep its commitments to customers, he adds.

Risks associated with future work are more clearly understood than in the past, and can be headed off before they disrupt production. Most importantly, when it comes to addressing problems, everyone is on the same page. Says Snow: “There are no more orphan action plans.”

Next, Airbus plans to introduce a mobile version of the digital control room, to improve accessibility when teams are onsite with suppliers. Snow says the company is working to integrate additional functions, including engineering and contract support, in order to develop predictive key performance indicators.

The tool remains internally based for the moment, “but the idea of opening it up so that we can have shared action plans with suppliers is something we’re looking at,” says Snow.

Airbus - Europe

A330neo: Airbus is expected to fly its A330neo next year. Neo stands for ""new engine option."" The A330, a two-decade old design, is getting a makeover with new engines and new wingtips to boost its range and fuel efficiency.

Airbus is positioning the 'neo' as a lower-cost alternative to Boeing's advanced 787 Dreamliner. The first of two planned models will fly next year and enter service in early 2018.

A321neo: The second member of Airbus's revamped single-aisle family, the A321neo, will enter service in 2017. It's the largest member of the updated A320neo family.

Airbus hopes the jet, which seats up to 240 passengers, will replace the out-of-production Boeing 757, an aging transcontinental workhorse for U.S. airlines. Airbus has a significant sales lead with the A321neo, and Boeing is considering new designs to keep its customers.

A319neo: The smallest member of the A320neo family is expected to fly for the first time in 2017, but demand for it isn't great. The smallest offerings from both Boeing and Airbus have received few orders because airlines are opting for larger and more fuel efficient models.

A350-1000: The A350-1000 made its first flight in Toulouse, France in late November, and Airbus has been accelerating its testing of the plane. The 366-seat long-range airliner is the biggest twin-engine jet Airbus has ever designed and is the second member of the A350 family. It is trying to supplant Boeing's best-selling twin-aisle airliner: the 777-300ER.

Airbus is slated to deliver the A350-1000 to Qatar Airways in late 2017.

Boeing - U.S.

737 Max 8: After five years in development, the first 737 Max will be delivered to Southwest Airlines in the first half of 2017. Boeing's fourth-generation single-aisle plane has two new engines and a new tail section and winglets -- designed to cut fuel consumption by 14%.

The Max 8 is the first of four 737 Max models Boeing is designing. Boeing has thousands of orders for the 737 Max, including from China's fast-growing airlines.

787-10: Boeing will take its new 787-10 Dreamliner on its first flight in the spring. The 320-seat airliner, made mostly of fiber carbon, is coming together inside the company's plant in North Charleston, South Carolina.

It's the first time the new factory has exclusive manufacturing responsibility for a new Boeing model, a sign of its growing importance for the company. The 787-10 won't fly as far as its two smaller Dreamliner siblings because airlines preferred fuel efficiency over range.

737 Max 9: Boeing will soon follow with the 737 Max 9, the largest member of Boeing's updated single-aisle 737 Max family. The jet is slated to fly for the first time in 2017. The first test aircraft's fuselage arrived at Boeing's plant in Washington state in late December ahead of final assembly.

The aircraft can seat up to 220 passengers in a single class and is Boeing's direct rival to the A321neo.

Comac - China

C919: China's first big airliner will be flown in 2017. The Comac C919 is aimed to compete with the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. Earlier this week, Comac cleared a hurdle when its engines -- made in the U.S. and France -- were approved by U.S. and European authorities.

The aircraft was originally supposed to fly in 2014, but the project has been repeatedly delayed due to China's relative inexperience in developing commercial airliners. Comac isn't expected to go toe-to-toe with Airbus and Boeing yet, but through partnering with western suppliers, China is cultivating itself as global contender for the next generation.

United Aircraft Corporation - Russia

MS-21: Russia's United Aircraft Corporation is getting ready to fly its all-new Irkut MS-21 in 2017. The project is backed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who wants to elevate the country's commercial aerospace industry to complete with the Airbus and Boeing single-aisle jets that dominate routes across the world.

Embraer - Brazil

E195-E2: Brazil's Embraer (ERJ) is deep into aerial testing of its heavily revamped E190-E2 airliner, a version of which flew for the first time last year. The second member of the E2 family, the E195-E2, will fly for the first time in 2017. The jet is the largest airliner the company has ever developed, seating around 132 passengers in a single-class cabin. The E195-E2 competes with Canada's all-new Bombardier CS100, which started carrying passengers in July.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8869031667709351}",neutral,0.8869031667709351,0

Donauwörth,On Thursday, the NH90 Sea Lion naval multi-role helicopter took off on its on-schedule maiden flight at Airbus Helicopters in Donauwörth. Wolfgang Schoder, CEO of Airbus Helicopters Deutschland; Ralph Herzog, Director in the Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology and In-Service Support (BAAINBw) and Vice Admiral Andreas Krause, Chief of the German Navy welcomed this important milestone in the programme.“We are proud to be delivering this state-of-the-art naval helicopter to the German Armed Forces on time,” said Wolfgang Schoder. “This new generation of NH90 naval helicopters, the Sea Lion, has benefited from experience gathered by other countries who have been using it.” The NH90 Sea Lion has an increased number of sensors and improved navigation and communications equipment, which means that this military helicopter will also be able to operate in civil air space. The military friend/foe identification has also been updated to the latest standards.For the BAAINBw in Koblenz, the Sea Lion is also a special project: “We need to keep to a tight schedule if we are to replace the Sea King in time. This requires all those participating in the project to coordinate quickly and efficiently to achieve this,” explained Ralph Herzog. “By using an existing NH90 model as the basis for the Sea Lion and adding the required additional functionalities to it, we have been able to significantly reduce the delivery process. This model is also configured not only to be an adequate replacement for the Sea King but is designed so that it can be adapted to future roles.”“The Navy is looking forward, as the first customer, to be receiving the NH90 Sea Lion on time by the end of 2019,” said Vice Admiral Andreas Krause. “We are now expecting a successful test phase.” Meanwhile, the Navy is preparing intensively for the acceptance of the helicopters with technical and flight personnel already training. Further measures have commenced at their future home, the Nordholz naval air base. Infrastructural changes and new buildings are necessary.Deliveries of NH90 Sea Lions to the Navy will start at the end of 2019. When deployed, it will take on a range of roles including search and rescue (SAR) missions, maritime reconnaissance, special forces missions as well as personnel and materiel transportation tasks. The German Armed Forces (Bundeswehr) have ordered 18 of these helicopters altogether, with the last due to go into service in 2022. The second NH90 Sea Lion awaiting qualification testing is currently at the final assembly stage and series production at Donauwörth will commence in the summer of 2017.In addition to its land-based use in SAR missions, the NH90 Sea Lion is also intended to operate on Type 702 (Berlin class) combat support ships.Thanks to its multi-role capability and future proofing, the Sea Lion will not merely replace the Bundeswehr’s Sea King Mk41 fleet but significantly enhance the Navy’s operational capabilities. The electronic fly-by-wire flight controls of the NH90 Sea Lion reduce the crew’s workload. Other benefits of this control system are its high precision and ease of use, which particularly come to the fore in over-water hovering, even in poor weather conditions.The NH90 Sea Lion shell is manufactured from advanced, high-strength composite materials. This offers optimum protection for the crew thanks to its excellent crash behaviour.Five nations are already using the naval NH90 NFH (NATO Frigate Helicopter). They have already completed more than 30,000 flying hours with the 69 helicopters delivered so far: in humanitarian and SAR and military missions on land and on board naval vessels. The German NH90 Sea Lion programme has greatly benefited from the experience gained from these operations. Altogether 129 NH90 NFH helicopters have been ordered; the total for all NH90 models comes to 515. The whole NH90 fleet comprising 296 helicopters delivered so far has already completed over 120,000 flying hours.Airbus Helicopters, a division of Airbus Group, provides the most efficient civil and military helicopter solutions worldwide. Its in-service fleet includes nearly 12,000 helicopters operated by more than 3,000 customers in 154 countries.

A closer look at Airbus manufacturing from Sciaky - 3D Printing Industry,"Fri, 16 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vM2RwcmludGluZ2luZHVzdHJ5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2Nsb3Nlci1sb29rLWFpcmJ1cy1tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nLXNjaWFreS0xMDEyMjAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hailing from Chicago, Illinois, Sciaky have been providing industrial scale manufacturing solutions to companies since 1939. Throughout the Second World War, the company supplied its welding systems to make U.S. warplanes, and subsequently developed its proprietary Electron Beam welding system throughout the 1950s. This time-tested technology has now evolved into Electron Beam Additive Manufacturing (EBAM) machines with primary uses in the manufacturing of aircrafts for public and defense aerospace companies.

The EBAM printer

Sciaky’s EBAM 110 System is now being delivered to multinational airplane manufacturers Airbus. The 110 System works by melting down a range of alloy metals into layers to build up a structure. The ‘filament’ used can be any weldable metal in a wire format, including titanium, stainless steels, tungsten, copper nickel and Inconel 718 – which is the same material being researched by the University of Pittsburgh with $500,000 funding from NASA.

Airbus’ special interest

Airbus’ interest in the system is in its capability to work with strong, light metals suitable for use within the construction of wings, tails and fins. Pictured below is a Sciaky EBAM titanium spar part which forms main skeletal structure of an Airbus wing.

The 110 System is also valued for its 5.83 ft. 3.91 x 5.2 ft. build size, for perhaps fabricating bigger parts of the fuselage, or even consolidating multiple parts into one seamless print. The machine also uses a Interlayer Real-time Imaging and Sensing System which can self-adjust the deposition of material without human input.

Collaboration with Sciaky adds to Airbus’ existing additive manufacturing partnerships with Stratasys and Arconic, through which the airline manufactures both metal and high-grade plastic parts.

Cutting costs

With additive manufacturing, aerospace clients are especially pleased with how the method cuts down on lead times, also meaning that they are able to cut down on financial cost.

RyanAir airlines chief executive Michael O’Leary has asserted that flights may be free of charge within the next decade:

If [air passenger duty] is gone: at many airports I’m paying more than £20 already with APD and fees, if I start getting that back, why not? I’m doing seat sales this week at £4 and I’m paying the £13 APD – I’m paying you to fly with me. Instead of promotional tickets being £9 or £5 they will be free.

Affiliation with airports will instead pay for the planes and the amount of traffic brought in by their service, so a reduce manufacturing cost may become even more vital to an airline’s ability to survive. As Sciaky marketing vice president Bob Phillips, comments in a statement about the delivery of the 110 System:

We all know that metal 3D printing technology is going to revolutionize manufacturing in the aerospace industry, and Sciaky is committed to being at the forefront of this movement.

Airbus seals deal with Iran for sale of 100 aircraft - Yahoo News,"Thu, 22 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vaXJhbi1zaWduLWRlYWwtYWNxdWlyZS1haXJidXMtMTMwODA2MTI1Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An Airbus A380, the world's largest jetliner, participates in a flying display during the 51st Paris Air Show at Le Bourget airport near Paris, June 15, 2015.

By Tim Hepher

PARIS (Reuters) - Europe's Airbus (AIR.PA) signed a firm contract on Thursday to sell 100 jets to IranAir, completing a return by Western plane giants and paving the way for deliveries to start next month, a year after sanctions against Iran were lifted.

The deal took weeks of shuttling between Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France, and Tehran, complicated by a shortage of expert legal advice as Iran completes its biggest commercial deals with the West since its 1979 Islamic revolution.

Confirming details first reported by Reuters, Airbus said almost half the jets would be for short to medium routes and that deliveries would start early next year.

The contract includes 46 of the narrrow-body A320 family which includes the A321 model, 38 long-haul A330s and 16 of Europe's newest long-range model, the A350.

Such a deal would be worth $18-20 billion at list prices, depending on variants flown, but Iran is expected to receive steep discounts from foreign manufacturers as its aviation renewal coincides with a drop in demand elsewhere.

The head of IranAir was quoted earlier as saying the value of the contract would not exceed $10 billion.

It is expected to be followed by a formal deal to buy turboprop aircraft from ATR, half-owned by Airbus.

The breakthrough comes days after Iran signed a $17 billion deal with Boeing for 80 jets and is expected to sharpen efforts by the U.S. company to persuade the incoming U.S. administration to allow the trade to go ahead, aviation experts said.

The first jet, an Airbus A321 already painted in IranAir livery, may arrive before the Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, who has opposed an international deal to lift sanctions in return for curbs on Iran's nuclear activities.

""When Airbus and ATR aircraft start going into Iran, Boeing will point to that to argue that it should implement its own deal,"" said an aviation source who closely followed the talks.

Boeing declined to comment.

MOVING QUICKLY

Despite rivalries, the Airbus and Boeing deals with Iran are unusually intertwined because each depends on continued U.S. clearances for the sale of planes built with U.S. parts.

""Everyone has an interest in moving quickly. The Iranian government wants to show results from the nuclear deal; Airbus wants to get deliveries moving and Boeing wants the leverage it can get from European deliveries to Iran,"" another source said.

The ability to renew Iran's ageing and accident-prone fleet is widely viewed as a test of the pragmatist policies of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani ahead of presidential elections in May.

Airbus said the deal was subject to U.S. Treasury export licences granted in September and November 2016.

Republican critics of the nuclear pact want Trump to block the aircraft deals and have sought to hamper them by voting to tighten restrictions on use of the U.S. financial system.

Airbus is expected to be paid in euros instead of the usual dollars and is likely to provide its own financing for the first few jets, adding to cash strains caused by a spike in customer financing for Turkey this year.

Planemaking chief Fabrice Bregier called the deal ""a significant first step"" in modernising Iranian aviation, adding it included training, airport operations and air traffic management.

However, both sides confirmed the Airbus A380 had been jettisoned from a provisional list first agreed in January.

Reuters first reported in June that the original proposal for 12 A380s - seen as a symbol of Iran's determination to catch up with Gulf rivals and a shot in the arm for Airbus as it struggled to sell the world's largest airliner - was threatened by domestic opposition in Iran.

U.S. regulatory delays further reduced the order by six planes, lowering the total order to 100 from 118 jets.

The deal comes after Iran bought 80 planes from Airbus rival Boeing.

Aircraft builder Airbus formally agreed with Iran Air, the flag carrying airline of Iran, to sell 100 aircraft to the carrier.

Thursday's deal was initially announced in January 2016, after the sanctions against Iran were lifted, but was followed by regulatory delays. Airbus said the deal was also subject to US government Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) export licenses, which were granted in September and November.

""We hope this success signals to the world that the commercial goals of Iran and its counterparts are better achieved with international cooperation and collaboration,"" said Iran Air Chairman and CEO Farhad Parvaresh.

The contract covered 46 Airbus A320 planes, 38 A330s and 16 A350 XWB aircraft, with deliveries set to begin in early 2017.

""Our overall accord includes pilot training, airport operations and air traffic management so this agreement is also a significant first step in the overall modernization of Iran's commercial aviation sector,"" said Airbus President and CEO Fabrice Bregier, referencing Iran Air's aging fleet.

Most of Iran Air's planes were purchased before 1979 and only 162 of its 250 commercial aircraft were operational as of June. Iran said it would like to purchase 400 passenger aircraft over the next decade.

The first Airbus aircraft could arrive before President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated on January 20. Trump opposed lifting sanctions on Iran. Iran holds its next presidential election in May 2017.

Parvaresh said the contract would not be more than $10 billion (9.5 billion euros). Iran Air also finalized a deal to purchase 80 aircraft from US rival Boeing, the largest deal Iran made with a US company since the 1979 revolution US embassy takeover. The deal with Boeing is reportedly worth 15.7 billion euros.

Airbus Helicopters delivers final H215M to Chilean Army - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 21 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1cy1oZWxpY29wdGVycy1kZWxpdmVycy1maW5hbC1oMjE1bS1jaGlsZWFuLWFybXkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In early December, the Chilean Army took delivery of a 10th heavy-weight, twin-engine H215M, the last delivery in a project that began in 2008, with the purchase of eight of these helicopters, to which two more were added in 2013 and 2014 respectively. The new rotorcraft will serve alongside the previous nine in the Helicopter Battalion of the Chilean Army’s Air Brigade.

Held at Airbus Helicopters’ facilities in Santiago, Chile, the handover ceremony was attended by General Humberto Oviedo Arriagada, the Commander in Chief of the Chilean Army; BGen Gustavo Núñez Kocher, the Commander of the Chilean Army’s Air Brigade; and Airbus Helicopters Chile general manager, Alexandre Ceccacci, among other civil and military dignitaries.

“This helicopter complements the army’s fleet, which now includes latest-generation aircraft with the ability to perform multiple missions across the entire country,” said Kocher. “Our confidence in this helicopter is based on the positive operational results i

t has achieved since coming into service in 2009. The H215M has proved its versatility and reliability across the Army’s numerous and demanding operations.”

The army’s H215M have completed more than 10,000 flight hours in a large number of missions that range from the provision of aid to remote areas and medical evacuations to firefighting and disaster relief. The Chilean Army’s Air Brigade played a crucial relief role during the floods that hit the Atacama region in 2015, carrying out 56 missions to provide support for flood victims.

“This project owes its success to the involvement of both parties and the relationship of trust that exists between them,” said Ceccacci. “I would like to thank the Army for all their support. It will be an honor to continue working together in the support of these aircraft as well as in other projects to come. Airbus Helicopters can be proud of the Air Brigade’s 10 H215M, and I can assure you that we will be working hard to ensure they continue delivering high-value capability.”

In addition to the 10 H215Ms, the Chilean Army operates a number of other Airbus Helicopters rotorcraft, such as the single-engine AS350B3, the twin-engine AS355NP and the Puma SA330L.

The H215 — and its military version, the H215M — forms part of the Super Puma family. It boasts multi-mission capabilities and delivers optimum performance in extreme operating conditions.

Combining modern avionics with a proven, robust platform the H215M offers long-range capabilities, power, speed and a large useful payload; making it the ideal aircraft to perform search-and-rescue missions. The H215 is also reliable and highly economical, with an availability rate of more than 95 percent.

Airbus in Iran to finalize plane deal – official - The Times of Israel,"Mon, 12 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzb2Zpc3JhZWwuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1pbi1pcmFuLXRvLWZpbmFsaXplLXBsYW5lLWRlYWwtb2ZmaWNpYWwv0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGltZXNvZmlzcmFlbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWluLWlyYW4tdG8tZmluYWxpemUtcGxhbmUtZGVhbC1vZmZpY2lhbC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TEHRAN, Iran — Airbus delegates have arrived in Tehran for talks aimed at finalizing a deal to sell around 100 planes, an Iranian official said Monday.

The representatives of the European aerospace giant arrived on Sunday just hours after national carrier Iran Air concluded a $16.6 billion deal with US firm Boeing to buy 80 planes.

“An Airbus delegation has arrived in Tehran,” said Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, deputy minister for transport.

“We have started negotiations and if there are no problems, we will sign the agreement within a week for the purchase of around 100 planes,” he told AFP.

Meanwhile, some conservatives in Iran reacted angrily to news of the deal with Boeing, which comes at a time when lawmakers in Washington have recently voted for renewed sanctions on the country.

Iran says the renewal of sanctions, which President Barack Obama is expected to approve in the coming days, is a breach of the nuclear deal it signed with world powers last year.

“60 trillion tomans: Iran’s gift to the US for violating the JCPOA (nuclear deal),” read Monday’s headline on the hardline Javan newspaper.

But Iran has been desperate to access new planes and parts after decades of economic isolation has left it with one of the world’s worst aviation safety records.

Better than ever: Airbus' AIRLINE1 returns for the A350-1000 flight test campaign - Airbus,"Thu, 15 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE2LTEyLWJldHRlci10aGFuLWV2ZXItYWlyYnVzLWFpcmxpbmUxLXJldHVybnMtZm9yLXRoZS1hMzUwLTEwMDAtZmxpZ2h0LXRlc3TSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"First A350-1000 successfully completes first flight<br /> <br /> <br /> The first of three A350-1000 development aircraft to fly – MSN059 – has landed at Toulouse-Blagnac Airport France at 15.00hrs local time after successfully completing its first flight which lasted four hours and 18 minutes.

With the A350-1000 jetliner’s flight test campaign now underway, Airbus is bringing back AIRLINE1 – the simulated airline experience focussing on aircraft maturity and operability, which was successfully introduced during the A350-900 version’s certification process.AIRLINE1 comprises a dedicated staff that operates a hangar and maintenance control centre in coordination with Airbus’ flight-test team. This allows for daily maintenance, support and repair operations in an environment similar to what the jetliner will experience in commercial service.For the A350-1000’s flight test campaign, however, AIRLINE 1 has an even sharper focus on visual inspections of the airframe and cabin, according to Philippe Garnier, Head of A350 XWB Maturity & Operability at Airbus.“We’re reinforcing AIRLINE1 to improve the way we manage potential failures and increase our understanding not just of the aircraft, but of our customers’ world, too,” he said. “Ultimately this is about improving maintenance efficiency, developing effective health monitoring and delivering machines that have the highest-possible levels of maturity to our customers.”These reinforcements include an operability “test card” that helps recreate an airline’s operating environment. It is boosted by the use of standard operating procedures for pre-flight and cockpit preparation, while referring to airline technical documentation for troubleshooting. Additionally, the health of the A350-1000 flight test fleet will be tracked using Airbus’ AirTHM real-time monitoring, and predictive monitoring will be tested as well.As the longest-fuselage latest member of Airbus’ all-new A350 XWB widebody family, the A350-1000 offers greater seating capacity and perfectly matches market needs with a larger premium area to accommodate first class and business class travellers. The no. 1 A350-1000 performed its maiden flight from Toulouse-Blagnac Airport in France last month, and is one of three aircraft that will participate in the new jetliner’s flight test and certification campaign.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9748231768608093}",positive,0.9748231768608093,1

This is the first of 70 A320neos that the Norwegian Group has on order. It is also the first of 12 A320neos that will be leased to Hong Kong carrier HK Express.



“This delivery is a milestone for us as it is the first of many Airbus aircraft to be delivered in the near future. It is a pleasure to work with HK Express and support their expanding network with the modern and fuel-efficient A320neo,” said AAA COO Tore Jenssen.

Norwegian will become an Airbus operator

Norwegian also plans to become an Airbus operator in the near future; earlier this year, AAA placed a new order of 30 Airbus 321 Long Range aircraft. Eight of these aircraft are scheduled to be delivered in 2019 and the remaining 22 the following two years.



The new medium-range aircraft fits well with Norwegian’s global expansion plans and future long-haul network, both in terms of size, range and fuel efficiency. The new aircraft type has a longer range than the A320neo, is even more fuel efficient and has a single aisle cabin, seating approximately 220 passengers. This aircraft will enable new route launches for example between the US East Coast and Europe, between Scandinavia and parts of Asia, as well as South America and Europe.

Cooperatives, Labor and Social Welfare Minister Ali Rabiei was quoted as saying by ISNA that Iran, which is negotiating through state flag carrier Iran Air, had agreed with Airbus to buy seven aircraft. The report fueled French media speculation that a keenly awaited deal between Iran Air and Airbus for more than 100 aircraft had been watered down significantly.

But industry sources said the two deals were not connected and identified regional carrier Aseman Airlines as the company behind the much smaller deal to procure seven aircraft, which Rabiei said would start arriving in May.

Those jets will be leased rather than purchased directly from Airbus, the sources said, without identifying the leasing company.

Aseman Airlines could not be reached for comment.

Last week, the European Union banned Iran’s Aseman Airlines from operating within the EU because of safety concerns, but the airline said afterwards that it does not fly to the EU.

Owned by Iran’s civil service pension foundation but managed as a private company, Aseman is Iran’s third-largest airline by active fleet size, according to the CAPA consultancy.

Meanwhile, a delegation from Airbus is in Tehran for talks to finalize a deal for about 100 planes.

Iran has been seeking to renew its aging aircraft fleet since the lifting of international economic sanctions in January under a nuclear deal reached with six major powers.

On Thursday, Airbus denied having finalized a deal with Iran Air but indirectly confirmed that another carrier had agreed to acquire seven aircraft via a third party.

“Airbus has not finalized any contract so far with Iran Air and the agreement for seven airplanes that has been reported is not directly with Airbus,” a spokesman said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996790885925293}",neutral,0.9996790885925293,0
"What Next for Deals With Boeing, Airbus? - Financial Tribune","Tue, 06 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jaWFsdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvZWNvbm9teS1idXNpbmVzcy1hbmQtbWFya2V0cy81NDg2OC93aGF0LW5leHQtZm9yLWRlYWxzLXdpdGgtYm9laW5nLWFpcmJ1c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"They may not be dead, but the Airbus and Boeing commercial aircraft deals struck this year with Iran likely will remain unresolved orders well into 2017 now that US lawmakers have fired their first post-election salvo, the American monthly trade publication Industry Week wrote in an article. Below is the full text.

On Nov. 17, the House of Representatives voted 243-174 to pass a bill that, if enacted, would block the Treasury Department from issuing certain trade licenses to finance aircraft sales to Iran. The vote comes nine days after Donald Trump was elected the next US president, following a campaign in which he pledged to scrap the current nuclear agreement with Iran that opened the way for the 200-plus aircraft deals.

The new bill applies equally to both Airbus and Boeing, according to a major sponsor, Rep. Peter Roskam. It further bars the US Export-Import Bank from facilitating such deals, including indirectly.

Yet, the bill does not stop or outright forbid commercial aircraft sales, it simply bars banks overseen by the US from participating in such deals or the use of taxpayer funds to facilitate them.

What is more, the measure is unlikely to move further in the lawmaking process until after Trump takes the Oval Office, as President Obama has promised to veto a related bill and Congress is too divided to override him.

So, proponents will have to reintroduce the bill in the new session of Congress that begins in January. Even then, Democrats, especially in the Senate, could fight it off successfully, as they have to date.

They might also eventually find some Republican allies—as they did in the fight over reauthorizing Ex-Im, since both OEMs have extensive manufacturing and supply chain providers across the US. Still, the vote last week saw just eight House Democrats join 235 Republicans to pass the bill.

In January, Airbus was first to sign a preliminary agreement with Iran Air for up to 118 aircraft, including 21 A320ceos, 24 A320neos, 27 A330ceos, 18 A330-900s and 12 A380s. Boeing followed in June with a letter of agreement for more than 100 airliners, including about 70 single-aisle aircraft and an unspecified number of 747-8s.

While Chicago-based Boeing is obviously a US company, Toulouse-based Airbus also needs US Treasury licenses, as more than 10% of its commercial airplanes and components are supplied by American companies or manufactured in the US, subjecting it to US sanctions. Airbus says it spends 42% of its commercial aircraft procurement resources in the US.

Treasury in September had granted Boeing an export license that covers 80 aircraft via direct sale and another 29 whose sale the OEM will help facilitate for leasing companies.

At the time, it also granted Airbus approval for the sale of just 17 aircraft, with licensing for the rest expected imminently. On Nov. 23—six days after the House vote—officials reportedly followed with licenses for up to 106 Airbus aircraft.

Financing Remains Central

Nevertheless, financing remains central to the deals being completed and the new bill makes the options clear. Iran can either pay in cash, all of the parties involved can find financing not subject to the long arm of US law, or some combination of both.

Dubai Aerospace Enterprise reportedly is lined up to lease the first 18 Airbus aircraft to Iran Air, thus skirting US restrictions, at least initially.

Boeing’s representatives say they did not plan on seeking Ex-Im backing and they made that clear to the Iranians. But Boeing has not discussed whether or where it will seek financing.

In turn, no one seems to be banking on the deals being finalized any time soon and some analysts say they remain as far-fetched as ever.

“I’m not privy to the Iranian side of the equation, but comments from Airbus have suggested that financing for this deal is a must. So with no financing, we have no deal,” says Vertical Research Partners defense analyst, Robert Stallard.

“I would agree with many in the industry that always described the Iranian deal as a long shot, but it would have helped Airbus and Boeing fill some delivery gaps for their most vulnerable models, like the 777 and the A380.”

Another Obstacle:

Cape Town Convention

Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Teal Group, echoes the doubts.

“It was never all that likely to have happened as planned,” he says, pointing to the Cape Town Convention as another obstacle.

The 2004 treaty establishes international standards for property rights of movable assets such as aircraft and it explicitly provided a benchmark for aircraft lessors and other aviation dealers.

Iran was not a signatory, limiting its attractiveness in the international aircraft market.

“It looks dead to me,” Aboulafia adds of the Airbus and Boeing deals. He expects Iran will return to its quieter, slower and untraditional means for acquiring commercial aircraft, as it has for the last three decades. As for the manufacturers, life goes on.

“I don’t think there is much damage at all,” he tells Aviation Week. “It is just a lot of confusion.”

Sanford C. Bernstein analysts said as much in a Nov. 21 note to investor clients.

“Trump has said he supports Boeing sales to Iran, but also said he would stop the Iran nuclear deal,” they say. “It is unclear how this will play out, but no one should have been modeling Iran sales as a sure thing in any case.”

Moody’s Investors Service Senior Vice President Russell Solomon says he is less optimistic about a deal getting done now, but advises against writing it all off.

“There is likely to be financing at some level—even if not for the full 200-plus aircraft initially targeted—just not from traditional sources [with US branches],” he says. “And it is a much smaller universe of potential funding sources with Iran not being part of the Cape Town Convention.”

In September, Solomon issued a report that described the deals as marginally beneficial to industry.

“Iran affords large commercial aircraft manufacturers a prospective boost of up to 3% to future industry demand through the next decade, or about 400-500 jets for Iranian airlines,” he said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999693632125854}",neutral,0.9999693632125854,0

PARIS/DUBAI - Reuters

Iran signed a $16.6 billion deal for 80 Boeing passenger jets on Dec. 11 and was said to be close to another for dozens of Airbus planes to complete what would be the biggest package of firm contracts with Western companies since Iran’s 1979 Islamic revolution.The deal between IranAir and U.S. planemaker Boeing includes 50 narrow-body 737 MAX aircraft and 30 long-haul 777s, split equally between the 777-300ER, which is badly in need of an order boost, and the 406-seat 777-9, which is under development.An Iranian official told Reuters that IranAir was also at the “very final stage” of formalizing a deal with Europe’s Airbus, which led Western companies back into Iran with a provisional agreement for 118 planes when Tehran emerged from global sanctions in January.The Airbus deal, which is expected to involve a first batch of 50-60 jets, should be completed in the next couple of days, the official said.Also closing in on a deal to renew Iran’s ageing fleet, kept going by smuggled or improvised parts after decades of sanctions, European turboprop maker ATR said it had received U.S. approvals needed to finalize the sale of up to 40 aircraft.The Boeing contract, the biggest Iran-U.S. deal since the fall of the Shah, clears a major technical hurdle towards implementing last year’s pact between Iran and world powers to reopen trade in return for curbs on Iran’s nuclear activities.However, political opposition could yet threaten a deal that would provide a welcome boost to Boeing’s order book after a year in which it has lagged behind rival Airbus.Congressional Republicans are trying to counter last year’s nuclear accord, with the U.S. House of Representatives passing a bill last month seeking to restrict financial transactions by U.S. banks in an effort to block the sale of Western passenger jets to Iran.The Iranian official said the Boeing deal was subject in part to further agreements on financing, but added that money from the deal would not pass through the U.S. financial system.Financial sources said Boeing has a financing plan for 15 777-300ER jets, which are expected to be delivered from 2018, but the rest of the financing may still have to be negotiated.The Dec. 11 move could also test relations between America’s top exporter and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, days after he complained about the cost of new Boeing “Air Force One” jets.Because of the length of the 10-year deal, some U.S. export licences may need to be extended during Trump’s administration. The president-elect, who opposes last year’s nuclear sanctions deal with Iran, has also rattled Boeing by sparring with China, which accounts for a fifth of the company’s deliveries.A Boeing statement said the Iranian contract would support tens of thousands of U.S. jobs for the 777-300ER jets and nearly 100,000 U.S. aerospace jobs for the whole package.In Iran the deal is viewed as a crucial political test for the government of pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani, who has been criticized by hardliners opposed to opening up to the West.The first Airbus aircraft are expected to reach Iran in 2017. Iran’s presidential elections are due in May.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999430179595947}",neutral,0.9999430179595947,0

The deal, which builds on an initial commitment for 118 aircraft signed in January 2016 in Paris, consists of forty-six A320 Family, thirty-eight A330 Family, and sixteen A350 XWB aircraft. Deliveries will begin in early 2017. Among the aircraft removed from the Paris accord are twelve A380-800s.

""The agreement is subject to US government Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) export licences which were granted in September and November 2016,"" the European manufacturer said.

As previously reported, the first aircraft to be delivered is A321-200 (sl) EP-IFA (msn 7418) which has already been painted in Iran Air's livery.

It is recalled Iran Air has firm orders for twenty ATR72-600s with twenty additional options to boot.

The types had been grounded by the FAA since June 3, after the Accident Investigation Board of Norway released its third prelimary report on the fatal crash of an H225 off the coast of Turøy, Norway. That report indicated metallurgical findings of fatigue and surface degradation in the outer race of a second stage planet gear of the main gear box (MGB) epicyclic module, and while the investigation continued, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) decided to temporarily ground the H225 and AS332 L2 fleets as a precautionary measure — a move adopted by the FAA the following day.

On June 29, while the fleet was still grounded by the regulators, Airbus issued an Emergency Alert Service Bulletin that called on operators to replace one of the two types of second stage planet gears in service in the H225 with the other; the reason being that one type was found to have increased damage tolerance and showed enhanced reliability.

EASA authorized the AS332 L2 and H225 Super Pumas to fly again on Oct. 7, issuing an Airworthiness Directive (AD) that ordered operators to complete the actions described in Airbus’s EASB, as well as mandating a life reduction and more frequent inspection for certain parts in the MGB.

The FAA’s AMOC (issued against AD 2016-21-51) is based on the same actions detailed in EASA’s AD.

The move provides a boost for Airbus, which is currently fighting three separate lawsuits from owners of H225/AS332 L2 Super Pumas who are seeking remuneration for aircraft they claim are no longer airworthy. All three referenced the ongoing FAA grounding in their original petitions to support their claims.

However, grounding orders remain in place from the UK Civil Aviation Authority and its Norwegian counterpart, and earlier this month, Norwegian oil company Statoil stated it will not use the type in the future — even if Norwegian authorities decide to lift the type’s grounding.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9992075562477112}",neutral,0.9992075562477112,0

Deliveries will begin in early 2017.

“I am delighted that we have reached an agreement to go to the next decisive phase and start taking delivery of new aircraft.

“This is a landmark agreement not only because it paves the way for Iran Air’s fleet renewal”, said Fabrice Bregier, Airbus President and CEO. “Our overall accord includes pilot training, airport operations and air traffic management so this agreement is also a significant first step in the overall modernization of Iran’s commercial aviation sector”.

The agreement is subject to U.S. government Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) export licenses which were granted in September and November 2016. These licenses are required for products containing 10 percent or more U.S. technology content. Airbus coordinated closely with regulators in the EU, U.S. and elsewhere to ensure understanding and full compliance with the JCPOA. Airbus will continue to act in full compliance with the conditions of the OFAC licenses.

The agreement follows the implementation of the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action), its associated rules and guidance and included new commercial aircraft orders as well as a comprehensive civil aviation package. The package includes pilot and maintenance training, supporting the development of air navigation services (ATM), airport and aircraft operations and regulatory harmonization.

The pilot trainings will continue during the spring of 2017 and may require Finnair to extend the period of the Iberia wet lease beyond the month of January.

Finnair flies to Miami three times a week. With the wet lease, the cockpit and cabin crew are from Iberia and the flights will have two Finnair service crew members on board to support the delivery of Finnair’s customer service concept.

“Pilot trainings are a key part of our preparations for growth. This wet lease from Iberia enables us to ensure punctual operations during a time when a large share of Finnair pilots are tied up in A350 related trainings,” says Jaakko Schildt, Chief Operating Officer, Finnair.

The wet leased aircraft from Iberia is three years old with 36 full-flat seats in Business Class and 242 seats in Economy Class, all with a seat-back inflight entertainment system. Finnair is contacting customers with bookings on the flights to be operated with the wet leased aircraft directly to inform them of the change in carrier.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999768733978271}",neutral,0.9999768733978271,0
Tanker 2.0: The A330 MRTT Evolving as a Global Fleet - Second Line of Defense - Second Line of Defense,"Tue, 06 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vc2xkaW5mby5jb20vMjAxNi8xMi90YW5rZXItMi0wLXRoZS1hMzMwLW1ydHQtZXZvbHZpbmctYXMtYS1nbG9iYWwtZmxlZXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"2016-11-29 By Robbin Laird

The Airbus tanker is the only advanced tanker in operations and has been so for several years.

Airbus Defence and Space has sold tankers to a number of countries and has done so in what one might call national or serial sales.

Getting the tanker sold, and out in the operational space is shaping a baseline reality.

But with significant operational experience under their belt and with the focal point of Middle East operations, cross-cutting experiences are shaping the way ahead among the nations.

A baseline has been created from which what one might call Tanker 2.0 is emerging.

Tanker 2.0 can be understood in a couple of ways.

The first way is the coalescing of experience to shape a global fleet perspective whereby common experiences and con-ops shape the way ahead for the development of the tanker as well as providing an opportunity for global support.

The 330 Tanker program is not there yet, but with the experience of the nations under their belts and with the forcing function of operating in common in the Middle East, a baseline has been created which clearly can allow for this evolution.

In this phase of Tanker 2.0 the user groups can evolve in their importance.

There will soon be a user group meeting in Madrid. The evolution of the role of the user group was described by one Airbus Defence and Space official as moving in the early days from a brief BY the company to the users to the emergence of genuine interaction AMONG the users to dialogue with the company about the way ahead for tanker modernization and ways to shape a global fleet approach.

The second way would focus on how and paths to upgrade the tanker as a combat asset in the extended battlespace.

Because the plane carries the fuel for tanking in the wings, the internal space of the tanker, which currently is used for passengers or cargo, can be modified in various ways to be much wider combat support asset in the extended battlespace.

There is clearly thinking under way, notably in Australia, about how to take the tanker to this next step from being an MRTT in terms of combining lift and tanking functions to becoming a much wider combat support asset in terms of ISR, and C2 functions.

After my recent visit to the Albacete Air Base in Spain, I visited the Airbus Defence and Space facility in Madrid, namely the Getafe facility. I had a chance to discuss the baseline and the way ahead with the head of the tanker program, namely, Antonio Caramazana.

I first met Antonio Caramazana at an Airbus Defence and Space (then Airbus Military) Trade Media brief for the media in 2010. That briefing which he gave only six years ago shows how far the tanker has come in only six years.

https://sldinfo.com/an-update-on-the-a330-mrtt-2010/

We started by getting an update on the status of the tanker and discussing the baseline.

We then went on to discuss the evolution of the aircraft from a platform to a fleet, with the inherent opportunities to shape a global fleet solution.

Question: Certa 2016, what is the current status of sales and operational experience of your tanker?

Antonio Caramazana: We have delivered 28 tankers to date.

We have delivered 14 to the UK; 5 to Australia; 6 to Saudi Arabia and 3 to the UAE.

These aircraft already integrated into operations.

The fleet is operating and is demonstrating its value added.

And all are operating in the Middle East, which has provided a significant opportunity for the users to gain joint knowledge about the tanker and its capabilities.

They are even doing combined operations in a number of cases.

89116 random 1.0 5.0

Question: You have sold the aircraft to several customers, but rather than just serial sales, you are seeing cross learning?

Antonio Caramazana: That is true.

For example, in the case of the clearance of receivers of fuel from the aircraft, the traditional approach would see a case by case national approach.

But there a particular national user is doing clearances, which provide certifications for other national users.

This is a culture shift for the air forces, which is provided by having a common aircraft, which is recognized as such by the air forces.

In effect, we are already seeing a global fleet which broaden the impact of the tanker.

For example, U.S. aircraft are being tanked by the various national tanker due to certification being done by specific nations which then allow the U.S. to tank into other national tankers.

Question: The next phase, which I will call Tanker 2.0, is to shape deliberately a global fleet. What are some of the key building blocks in your view to going down this path?

Antonio Caramazana: We are developing a A330 MRTT advanced which is designed to deliver a common aircraft, with common upgrade paths and solutions.

This will allow nations to get better value for money for their modernization investments.

Common configurations will be better for operations, and upgrades.

It will as well enhance common solutions to training, to parts supplies and to maintenance.

This is a way ahead for what you are calling Tanker 2.0.

This provides for culture change for both the militaries and industry to shape such a global solution.

The more users that buy into a common solution, costs can be contained with regard to upgrades, training and maintenance.

89061 fade 1.0 5.0

It will also allow tankers from one nation to fly to an area of interest and potentially leverage the support structure of a nation operating the tanker in that region of interest.

And the life cycle costs for such a global fleet will be lowered as well.

Our user groups are discussing paths to upgrades, more effective maintenance approaches, and other ways ahead to shape global solutions.

This is the advantage of already having several years of operations behind us as well as an aircraft with significant room for expansion of onboard systems as well.

Question: But Tanker 2.0 provides for another way ahead, namely to expand the contribution of the tanker to other combat assets in the battlespace.

How would you describe this way ahead?

Antonio Caramazana: From the inception of the A330MRTT, we have put into the market a very flexible asset with multiple capabilities.

You can combine passenger lift, cargo lift and tanking within the same platform, and countries like Australia or operating their C-17s with their tankers in very flexible ways in terms of cargo and passenger lift operating over both platforms while the tanking function allows both to go to the area of interest.

At the same time, with the evolution of militaries look to shape enhanced connectivity in the battlespace, a key way ahead is to rethink how the tanker can support other combat sets in terms of ISR and C2 functions.

This is work in progress, but given the flexibility of the tanker in terms of internal space, there are many possibilities for users.

This is about having a smart tanker able to link assets in the battlespace, air, ground or sea.

It can provide an ISR and C2 node function for the joint force in the battlespace. It is an information age aircraft as well as playing more classical role of a tanker.

Avicopter AC352 flies at last - Vertical Mag - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 20 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYXZpY29wdGVyLWFjMzUyLWZsaWVzLWxhc3Qv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The first flight of the Avicopter AC352 medium twin took place on Dec. 20 in Harbin, China, 15 months after the first public appearance of the prototype and following many postponements since 2011. The milestone marks a further step in China’s endeavor to create its own helicopter industry, as the country has so far been mostly used to manufacturing rotorcraft under license agreements.

The AC352 is the Chinese counterpart of the in-service Airbus Helicopters H175, as they were developed under a 50-50 partnership. Airbus Helicopters’ logo is visible on the prototype. The aircraft seems to be aerodynamically identical, apart from the engines’ installation, to the H175. A hoist attached to the right side of the fuselage may indicate Avicopter wants to test the aircraft in a search-and-rescue configuration, early in the program.

The main difference is the engine, as Safran Helicopter Engines is providing a pair of Ardiden 3Cs in lieu of Pratt & Whitney PT6C-67Es. The Ardiden 3C is understood to be rated at approximately 1,800 shaft horsepower (shp), slightly more than the 1,775-shp PT6C-67E. Safran claims its turboshaft burns 10 percent less fuel than its competitor.

The Ardiden 3C is also known as the WZ16, as it has been jointly developed by Safran Helicopter Engines, CAPI and Dongan, parts of the new Aero Engine Corporation of China (AECC) consortium. Safran defined the engine’s architecture, while Dongan has developed the compressor and various parts, a Safran expert explained to Vertical. The engine partnership is both about development and production.

The AC352 is equipped with the same Helionix avionics suite and four-axis autopilot as its European counterpart. Representatives from both Airbus and Safran attended the first flight. “We will continue our cooperation toward the goal of engine certification at an early date,” said Qin Yuchun, president of AECC Dongan.

The WZ16 is expected to be the first helicopter engine certified in parallel by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). The EASA certification for the Ardiden 3C is expected by the end of 2017, and the CAAC certification for the WZ16 in 2018.

According to Chinese media, Avicopter is planning on delivering the first AC352 in 2018. At China Helicopter Expo in Tianjin in 2015, the company announced oil-and-gas operator Citic Offshore Helicopter is the launch customer.

Airbus and Avicopter have shared the program but certification efforts, customer support networks and marketing areas are distinct. An agreement was signed to allow Avicopter to sell the AC352 in China and a small number of neighboring countries. However, Airbus received an order last year from Hong Kong’s Government Flying Service for seven H175s.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997891783714294}",neutral,0.9997891783714294,0
This crazy airliner concept lets airlines easily mix and match seating configurations - The Verge,"Fri, 16 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDE2LzEyLzE2LzEzOTQwMzkwL2FpcmJ1cy10cmFuc3Bvc2UtYWlycGxhbmUtaW50ZXJpb3ItY29uY2VwdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Most people don’t think about the process of assembling the interior of an aircraft when they’re flying. Instead, passengers focus on more immediate concerns like peanuts and tight legroom. But installing the inside of an aircraft is hugely important for airlines: they must make decisions about balancing that legroom with the number of seats, as well as making sufficient room for things like bathrooms and galleys.

Because installing the aircraft interior is such a labor-intensive (and highly regulated) process, even simple changes can be major undertakings. Most airlines only adjust their cabins every seven to 10 years, and even then the changes are generally minimal and limited to new seats or entertainment systems and the like. And this is a problem.

configure the interior like Lego pieces

Plane interiors set up for domestic travel might not be equipped to fly over water, or to international destinations, even when the planes themselves might be perfectly capable of making the journey. This lack of space greatly limits the flexibility airlines have when planning and swapping aircraft between flight routes.

But what if an airline could mix and match aircraft interiors like Lego pieces? Transoceanic flights are often equipped with an sleeping accommodations for first-class passengers and large galleys for serving food. Imagine if those could be quickly replaced with an all-coach seating experience for a quick hour-long shuttle flight?

That’s what Airbus hopes to make a reality with Transpose, a development from A3, the advanced projects and partnerships division of Airbus located in Silicon Valley. The idea is to create a modular commercial aircraft cabin system that would fill freight aircraft (which routinely are emptied and refilled with standardized cargo containers) with fixed-size cabin compartments that can be reconfigured very quickly.

Instead of redesigning new aircraft, Transpose looks to repurpose existing planes to make them more flexible. The vision is a little crazy: Transpose thinks airlines could install sections filled with exercise bikes to help flyers stay active on long flights, or a cafe from a major coffee chain, or perhaps a kid-safe play area. I’m not sure if airlines will jump on board with all these amenities when they could just stuff more seats in instead. But could be a compelling vision for both passengers and airlines.

“This is an interesting concept,” said a Delta spokesperson when asked about Transpose. “We’ll continue to discuss what the long-term future of aircraft cabins could be with our valued partner Airbus and others.”

Delta has recently announced that it’s going to be retrofitting it’s long-haul aircraft with a new Delta One business class offering that includes individual suites, as well as a new Premium Select class that fits between coach and business on international flights. Retrofitting all its cabins will be a long and expensive proposition, one that could be made cheaper by a modular system like Transpose.

Airbus hopes to have Transpose-enabled aircraft in operation “within a few years,” which it calls ambitious but “completely achievable.” Transpose project executive Jason Chua asks airlines, manufacturers, brands, and passionate passengers to reach out and “collaborate on changing the way we fly.”

No word on how Transpose would affect those peanuts, though.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999802112579346}",neutral,0.9999802112579346,0

dentCHECK® - Now Published in Airbus' Tool Manuals USA - English - USA - PR Web,"Thu, 01 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByd2ViLmNvbS9yZWxlYXNlcy9kZW50Y2hlY2tfbm93X3B1Ymxpc2hlZF9pbl9haXJidXNfdG9vbF9tYW51YWxzL3Byd2ViMTM4ODgyMDQuaHRt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"dentCHECK is the new gold-standard against which all dent-mapping tools will be compared in the future. Post this

“Demand for dentCHECK from airlines and MROs has been positively overwhelming, and a strong reinforcement of our vision to create a tool built-from-the-ground-up to serve the aviation industry's needs,” said Arun Chhabra, CEO of 8tree. “We are very grateful that with these TEB publications, Airbus has responded to the global airline community’s requests for dentCHECK. To the best of our knowledge, dentCHECK is the first and only truly portable and operator-friendly 3D measuring tool approved for dent-inspection on Airbus aircraft. dentCHECK is the new gold-standard against which all dent-mapping tools will be compared in the future.”

During the past 18-months, several commercial airlines, cargo carriers and MROs have been implementing dentCHECK to improve their operational efficiency. TAP-Maintenance & Engineering (TAP-M&E), a global provider of comprehensive heavy-check MRO services, recently published a case-study detailing more than 90% reduction in dent-mapping and reporting times as a result of their adoption of dentCHECK. Since implementing dentCHECK at its Brazil MRO operations last year, TAP-M&E can now conclusively inspect dents and create SRM-compliant dent reports at an effective rate of 240 dents per man-hour-day. This compares to TAP-M&E's previous industry-leading effective rate of 16 dents per man-hour-day using traditional mapping methods. TAP-M&E formally presented these findings at the 59th annual Airlines For America (A4A) NDT conference in San Diego in Sept 2016.

dentCHECK is a handheld, portable 3D surface inspection tool that delivers simple 1-button dent-mapping & corrosion blend-out analysis, which are presented as instantly actionable SRM-compliant and easy-to-understand ‘go/no-go’ color-coded results. In just a few seconds, dentCHECK calculates reliable and consistent A / Y measurements.

As a completely self-contained and fully networked tool, dentCHECK can seamlessly transfer inspection results to an airline/MRO’s secure servers using its built-in WiFi / USB capability. This allows engineering teams to rapidly generate detailed dent-reports using 8tree’s unique SRM-compliant 1-Click Analysis Report™ capability. In addition to A/Y measurements, the report equips operators with other critical information, including, numerically annotated deformation color-maps, distance to next frame/stringer, and detailed measurement logs (zone #, time-stamp, operator ID, part ID, etc.) to facilitate quick SRM compliance that is tailored to an airline's specific requirements.

With 8tree’s patented product design and augmented reality presentation of results directly on the surface of the aircraft, The Surface Becomes The Screen™. As with all 8tree products, user-programming and surface preparation (stickers, etc.) are never required. dentCHECK has been shipping to major airlines since last year.

dentCHECK empowers aircraft maintenance operations with first-of-its-kind objective and consistent dent-inspection results. This reduces aircraft Turn-around-Time (TaT), which in turn reduces lost revenues and improves operational efficiency for airlines. dentCHECK enhances safety through an improved understanding of airframe reliability.

Thinking outside the shoe - Airbus,"Fri, 02 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE2LTEyLXRoaW5raW5nLW91dHNpZGUtdGhlLXNob2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Pioneering spirit and relentless tenacity

We celebrate the UN International Day of Persons with Disabilities with Jessica Cox, an aviator with a pioneering spirit and relentless tenacity. Although born without arms as the result of a birth defect, she has never allowed that to be a limiting factor. She travels the world encouraging people to eliminate the words I can’t from their vocabulary.

Jessica became the first woman to fly an airplane with her feet, obtaining her pilot license on 10 October 2008

Mind over matter

At two years old, she would play with toys using her feet. At the age of 14 she was already a Taekwondo black belt, mimicking the movements that others made with their arms, and at 25 she became the first person in history to be a certified pilot using only her legs to fly the plane. That feat landed her in the Guinness Book of World Records.

A psychology graduate and Taekwondo black belt, Jessica Cox has turned the tables on her so-called “disability”, allowing it to enable her as a motivational speaker and advocate in the US and beyond.

She shows people how to achieve goals through self-confidence and creativity. His motto: Think Outside the Shoe. This year, a documentary about her life title Right Footed has been released after winning numerous awards at film festivals around the world.

I’ve read that you don’t like using the word ‘disabled’...

Jessica Cox: I think it is a deceptive word. Both ‘handicapped’ and ‘disabled’ are words that imply a lack of something. I prefer ‘differently-abled’. Basically, there are people who are just different, and have different ways of doing things. One example is myself. I was born without arms, but I am not disabled. I can do everything with my feet, I just live in a different world from the one I call ‘the world of two hands.’ I can do almost everything with my feet including put in my contact lenses, typing on a keyboard – 25 words per minute - cooking, washing dishes, scuba diving, driving, applying my make-up... only for certain activities do I need help or special tools. Also, the limitations that I have always encountered have made me develop a lot of creativity and imagination to find suitable ways of doing things.

What gave you the idea to become a pilot?

JC: A friend of mine who is a pilot had a big influence on my decision. I had never flown in a single-engine aircraft before. In fact, I’d had a huge fear of commercial airplanes since I was a child. However, I persuaded myself that it was a great opportunity to overcome my fears. As Eleanor Roosevelt once said, you have to look fear in the face and walk right up to it. You have to confront your fears in order to overcome them.

I can imagine that during your three years of training, you had moments of doubt...

JC: The only prerequisite for getting a sport pilot’s certificate is that you have a driving license, which I already had. However, my problem was logistical. I needed a specific model – which I found in the Ercoupe 415C – with a spacious cabin, without pedals for the tail rudder, and with a throttle on the control panel at the right height for me.

How did you feel on that first flight?

JC: I remember that when I flew for the first time, images popped into my head of a game I played as a child, sitting in a sand pit and imagining that I was Superwoman flying over the top of the school, carrying my friends. There is no experience as powerful or that gives you such a feeling of independence as piloting an aircraft. For me, there is nothing else remotely like it!

Looking at the obstacles that you have had to overcome, where does your tremendous vital drive come from?

JC: It comes from realising how many people have helped me, and my need to give to others as well. A while ago, I realised that I had been blessed, and I noticed that the things I do help to inspire other people, so I said to myself, “Why not? Why not use the gift that I have to help others?” Also, I am very persistent and maybe I do have more energy than most people, which is what helps me. In my work, I teach people that there is always more than one way of accomplishing a task.

Is that why you decided to stop using your prosthetic limbs?

JC: I got rid of them when I was 14 years old. I decided to stop wearing them because they were just not me. I actually only wore them because everyone else used to tell me I had to.

In my case, I often find it incredibly tricky to multitask. I suppose this is because I am a man, or are there any tips you can give me?

JC: Doing things and completing any task is something that comes naturally to me. Just as naturally as it does to you, or maybe slightly more so (she laughs). My mother started placing toys at my feet when I was two, and now I can do everything with them, including using chopsticks. And I’ll continue to use them to tackle new challenges. Right now I’m looking for a new adventure. I’ve finished my first book and Right Footed has been released. If you have any ideas, let me know.

Given your progress, what about learning to pilot an A380 then?

JC: Who knows (laughing)? The first step in any venture is to set your mind on it.

Airbus A330neo and A350neo in flight – Rendering, Airbus

The agreement between Iran Air and Airbus is made up of:

46 Airbus A320 family

38 Airbus A330 family

16 Airbus A350 family

The order follows on from an original letter of intent for 118 aircraft signed in 2016.

First deliveries will begin in early 2017, with an Iran Air A321 already painted and in flight test.

Both Iran Air and Airbus are please with Farhad Parvaresh, Iran Air Chairman and CEO stating.

“I am delighted that we have reached an agreement to go to the next decisive phase and start taking delivery of new aircraft. I am gratified that this new round of cooperation with Airbus has come to fruition and brought us closer with more practical steps to follow for Iran Air’s fleet renewal. Iran Air considers this agreement an important step towards a stronger international presence in civil aviation. We hope this success signals to the world that the commercial goals of Iran and its counterparts are better achieved with international cooperation and collaboration”

The order itself is subject to the US government Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) export licences which were granted in September and November 2016.

In particular, these licences are required if planes contain 10% or more of US Technology content.

The road to ordering planes for Iran Air (and other Iranian airlines) is a long one – with trade sanctions being a key barrier to renewing its fleet.

With some sanctions eased, new aircraft will start arriving. However, one cannot predict the political climate (especially in the USA) – which could bring this whole thing to a shuddering haul quickly.

Whilst not one to watch in terms of massive change, the political fallout could be more interesting.

But for Iran Air – its a step to modernise and update.

The flights will launch on Jan. 17, 2017 and will be the airport’s first commercial Airbus A350 service. Singapore launched flights from Manchester to Houston back in October.

Sheldon Hee, Singapore Airlines’ General Manager for the UK and Ireland commented on this aircraft upgrade saying, “We are excited to operate the A350, the newest and most advanced aircraft in our fleet to Singapore and Houston from Manchester shortly.”

The airline’s A350 can seat up to 366 passengers and replaces the 278-passenger Boeing 777-300ER aircraft originally used for the route. With the newly added Manchester route, flights operating from Houston will no longer need to stop in Moscow while enroute to Singapore.

Singapore Airlines currently offers five weekly flights from Houston to Manchester, each with continuing service to Singapore Changi Airport, where travelers can connect to more than 50 destinations throughout Asia.

In addition, travelers flying to Manchester can take advantage of new routes to Paris, Amsterdam, and Milan thanks to the airline’s partnership with Flybe.

Last week, the carrier also announced new service to Stockholm, which complements its existing flights to Copenhagen. This route will also be operated by the Airbus A350-900 with a stop in Moscow. Flights are expected to begin on May 30, 2017.

By the second half of 2017, at least two carriers will be operating the A350XWB out of Manchester, with the other being Cathay Pacific who announced earlier this month that they would be increasing frequencies at Manchester and Gatwick using their Airbus A350 aircraft.

"Report estimates costs, benefits of improved helicopter crash resistance - Vertical Magazine","Mon, 19 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvcmVwb3J0LWVzdGltYXRlcy1jb3N0cy1iZW5lZml0cy1pbXByb3ZlZC1oZWxpY29wdGVyLWNyYXNoLXJlc2lzdGFuY2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Requiring all newly manufactured helicopters to comply with existing crash resistance standards would cost the industry approximately $764 million over 10 years, a working group has found.

The estimate appears in a cost-benefit analysis report submitted to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA’s) Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) by the Rotorcraft Occupant Protection Working Group. According to the report, the costs of mandating compliance with U.S. regulations for crash resistant seats, structures, and fuel systems are more than five times greater than the projected economic benefits, which were estimated at around $144 million over 10 years.

However, these figures should be regarded with caution. The industry working group arrived at its cost estimate using nonstandard methodology that may have resulted in a higher estimate than FAA cost calculations would have yielded.

Meanwhile, the working group used standard FAA methodology to calculate benefits, despite some members arguing that “current FAA methodology for calculating the economic costs of fatal and serious injuries significantly underestimates the actual societal costs of these injuries.”

The FAA created the Rotorcraft Occupant Protection Working Group in late 2015, after high-profile fatal accidents — notably the fiery crash of a Flight For Life helicopter in Frisco, Colorado — drew attention to the fact that many new-build helicopters fail to meet safety standards that have been in place for decades.

The FAA adopted its current helicopter fuel system crash resistance standards in 1994, and dynamic crashworthiness standards in 1989. But because the standards do not apply to rotorcraft with type certificates approved before those dates, a majority of civil helicopters manufactured over the past two decades do not fully comply with these requirements.

In announcing the creation of the working group, the FAA noted that the numbers of U.S. fatal helicopter accidents and associated fatalities have remained “virtually unchanged” over the past decade, despite a decline in the total number of accidents.

“If the occupant protection improvement rules are not incorporated in new production helicopters,” the FAA stated at the time, “there will be no meaningful reduction in the number of fatalities in helicopter accidents.”

Twenty members of the helicopter industry were appointed to the working group, including representatives from operators, manufacturers, and industry associations. Their first assigned task was to perform a cost-benefit analysis for incorporating existing occupant protection standards into newly manufactured rotorcraft.

To accomplish the task, the working group divided into two subgroups: a Cost Task Group, consisting primarily of manufacturer and operator representatives; and a Benefits Task Group, including accident investigators, accident analysts, and safety experts.

The working group submitted its initial cost-benefit analysis report to the ARAC on March 13, 2016, but was granted additional time to complete a more accurate and detailed report, which was submitted on Nov. 10 and accepted by the ARAC last week.

In performing its cost analysis, the Cost Task Group considered both the non-recurring design costs and ongoing manufacturing costs likely to be incurred by manufacturers, as well as operator costs related to the reduction in payload, reduction in fuel load and range, and increase in fuel burn rate resulting from the design changes.

In its final report, the working group expressed the opinion that “current FAA standard methodology does not accurately consider the practical costs of aircraft modification,” and stated that it “sought to correct this by using a methodology that it feels more accurately predicts actual industry costs.”

According to an FAA statement attached to the report, the working group’s operator cost methodology does not follow the method of accounting for impact on empty weight and useful load that is used in other ARAC and FAA economic impact analyses. The FAA also noted that non-recurring costs are not broken down to a level that allows review and validation of costs from each manufacturer, and that international development costs are not split out separately, as they typically are in the FAA’s economic impact studies.

By contrast, the Benefit Task Group did use FAA methodology to calculate the value of the lives that would be saved and serious injuries avoided if crash resistant seats and structures (CRSS) and crash resistant fuel systems (CRFS) were fully implemented in newly manufactured helicopters. This methodology values the avoidance of a fatality at $9.6 million, the avoidance of a serious injury at approximately $2.4 million, and the avoidance of a minor injury at $28,800.

By analyzing accidents of rotorcraft manufactured between 2006 and 2015, the group was able to confirm that compliance with the CRFS standards of 14 Code of Federal Regulations 27/29.952 is “extremely effective at preventing post-crash fires and thermal injuries.” The group found that there were no post-crash fires in survivable accidents involving compliant rotorcraft, and that fully compliant CRFS are moderately effective even in extreme impact crashes.

However, the working group noted that its analysis was “greatly inhibited by the fact that neither [the National Transportation Safety Board] nor FAA determine impact conditions in an accident investigation nor injuries for the involved occupants,” and that “lack of these data render occupant protection analysis almost impossible.”

In a statement of non-concurrence attached to the report, working group member Krista Haugen pointed to the Frisco Flight For Life crash as an example of how the absence of detailed injury data can lead to underestimating the value of safety improvements. In the group’s analysis, the flight nurse who suffered serious injuries in that crash represented a net benefit valuation of $2.4 million, yet his medical expenses alone are likely to be much higher than that — and that’s without taking into account his lost earnings, the impact on his quality of life, or the burdens placed on family members.

“The thermally injured survivor of this crash sustained full-thickness burns to 90 percent of his body because of the post-crash fire. He was hospitalized in the burn intensive care unit for 11 months, with total hospitalization time just over 12 months,” Haugen stated. “He will require medical care for the rest of his life . . . and it must be emphasized that he literally would have walked away with minor blunt injuries, were it not for the post-crash fire.”

The lack of detailed injury data also makes it difficult to determine the effectiveness of designs that are in partial compliance with existing standards. For example, David Shear of Robinson Helicopter Company noted that Robinson has performed voluntary dynamic seat testing that “showed that the existing occupant protection features on the R22 and R44 are very effective,” meeting the head impact criteria, lumbar spine load, and seat belt tension load requirements of 14 CFR 27.562. For these models, he claimed, “there would be little to no benefit if the design revisions required to demonstrate full compliance with [the CRSS standards of ] 27.561, .562, and .785 were incorporated.”

Likewise, working group member John Wittmaak of Bell Helicopter contended that “all in-production Bell models, whether certified to 27/29.952 or not, currently have CRFS as part of their basic aircraft offering. . . . Bell Helicopter believes efforts to certify currently in-production CRFS systems provide no benefit and ultimately delay availability and increase costs associated to retrofit solutions for pre-CRFS aircraft.”

In its report, the working group observed that “partial implementation of the subject regulations may provide a significant portion of the benefits while avoiding much of the costs.” The group expects to study this further in its next task phases, which will include making specific recommendations on how to implement existing occupant protection standards, or proposing new, alternative performance-based safety regulations.

The FAA stated that it will continue to work with the group, “with the desire to create a more refined cost-benefit analysis which aligns with other ARAC and FAA economic analysis to support the next tasking actions.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9990898370742798}",neutral,0.9990898370742798,0
Airbus’ Vahana VTOL project asks what vehicle makes for the best self-flying taxi - TechCrunch,"Wed, 14 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAxNi8xMi8xNC9haXJidXMtdmFoYW5hLXZ0b2wtcHJvamVjdC1hc2tzLXdoYXQtdmVoaWNsZS1tYWtlcy1mb3ItdGhlLWJlc3Qtc2VsZi1mbHlpbmctdGF4aS_SAXdodHRwczovL3RlY2hjcnVuY2guY29tLzIwMTYvMTIvMTQvYWlyYnVzLXZhaGFuYS12dG9sLXByb2plY3QtYXNrcy13aGF0LXZlaGljbGUtbWFrZXMtZm9yLXRoZS1iZXN0LXNlbGYtZmx5aW5nLXRheGkvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus debuted Project Vahana earlier this year, an ambitious project designed with the specific intent of creating small, efficient vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) craft for use in dense urban environments with a target launch date of 2021. Now, the company is proceeding with its plans, and detailing its Trade Study, the first part of which asks what a functional VTOL that meets Vahana’s needs would look like.

In a blog post, project lead Zach Lovering describes how Vahana went from a list of needs to a more tangible view of what the best design would be to actually achieve those needs. The basic job needed from the vehicles were that they fit a single human passenger, be cost-efficient, and run on electric power. That left a huge number of potential designs, however, so Vahana got to the task of narrowing the range of options.

To start they began with the two most basic configurations of VTOL possible given their parameters – either an electric helicopter, with one large dominate rotor, or a tilt-wing design with eight fans aligned side-by-side in two rows.

Why one versus the other? Helicopters are already everywhere as functioning VTOLs today, so there are fewer hurdles in terms of coming up with an effective design. But the eight-fan tilt-wing – aside from just looking cooler – has better aerodynamic performance while cruising than a helicopter, and draws less power than other options like a tilt-rotor, which looks like this:

The eight-fan design (shown in the concept at the top of this post) also won out because it takes up less space, while also offering some redundancy in case of rotor failure, unlike the smaller, four-fan design. Again it also looks really cool, but Vahana strangely did not mention this in their official comments as a guiding reason.

Vahana also considered the right size at this stage, and found that this required a more concise definition of what hey want to achieve, and to make assumptions about the progress of technology over the next few years, since the vehicle wouldn’t enter the “detailed design” phase until around three years from now, by which time there will presumably be improvements in battery capacity and other elements of the design, like the power output possible from electric motors.

Other considerations, including sensors and autonomous flight capabilities, are assumed to be shared between the two potential aircraft designs. Vahana is planning to share more about this stage of its product design testing, and plans to share more in the new year – but it’s fun to be able to follow along as a company seeking to actually build “flying cars” – or their more realistic equivalent, at least.

Vahana still aims to be ready with a full-scale prototype next year, and a demonstration unit ready for production in time for 2020.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998569488525391}",neutral,0.9998569488525391,0

"How Safran Landing Systems tests landing gear, wheels and brakes - Runway Girl Network","Fri, 16 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTYvMTIvaG93LXNhZnJhbi1sYW5kaW5nLXN5c3RlbXMtdGVzdHMtbGFuZGluZy1nZWFyLXdoZWVscy1hbmQtYnJha2VzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The 20 November inauguration by Safran Electrical & Power of a new Charleston facility supporting the landing-gear and wiring assembly for 787s assembled on Boeing’s North Charleston line provided a gentle reminder that Safran Landing Systems (SLS) makes the landing and braking systems for the all-electric Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

SLS is a world leader in aircraft landing and braking systems. It works with 30 major commercial, military, business and regional aircraft manufacturers and supports more than 25,000 aircraft, which make over 40,000 landings each day.

Safran Landing Systems also provides landing gear and wheels and brakes for the Airbus A320 family (including all A320neo-family jets), the Airbus A330 (including all A330neos) and A340 families and the Airbus A350 XWB. SLS also provides wheels and brakes for the Boeing 737NG and 737 MAX families. Among its many landing-gear technology achievements, SLS pioneered the introduction of carbon brakes, now standard in the industry.

One important area of the landing gear, wheels and brakes business rarely discussed is how these critical assemblies are tested, so Runway Girl Network asked two senior SLS executives how it tests its wheel and brake designs for qualification and aircraft type certification.

Grant Minnes, VP systems integration and testing for Safran Landing Systems’ Landing Gear Division, says SLS’ landing gear testing is based on a pyramidal qualification structure with pre-certification flight-testing of installed landing gears at its apex. Below that is a huge body of testing work on individual landing gear components, sub-assemblies and fully assembled landing gears.

Vital to all landing-gear qualification testing is testing for robustness. This involves SLS testing from one to four examples of each component, sub-assembly and full landing-gear assembly to 150 percent of the most extreme loads and conditions to which it would ever be subjected in service. These tests, carried out long before the first flight of the aircraft itself, are performed repeatedly until the unit or assembly eventually fails.

One key robustness test is the drop test, according to Minnes. FAA and EASA commercial-aircraft-certification criteria require all main landing-gear bogeys to be able to withstand a 10ft-per-second impact with the runway without failing. Not only does SLS drop each main landing gear design – each with a 250,000lb mass load on it (the maximum aircraft weight supported by each bogey) – from a drop height which creates a 10ft-per-second impact, but it also drops them from a height which creates a 12ft-per-second impact, resulting in a 50 percent greater impact force on the bogey.

Another important area of landing-gear testing is strength tests, says Minnes. These tests emulate the entire range of operational forces the landing gear might encounter during its life cycle – high-velocity landings, hard turns, drift landings, the forces exerted by pushback tugs on nose gears, fast and slow exits to taxiways, and the forces aircraft at maximum ramp weight exert on landing gears during pre-takeoff taxiing.

Another important category of landing-gear testing is fatigue testing. This is relatively low-force testing which simulates the actual forces on each unit during each flight cycle. Fatigue testing lasts for up to eight years, is carried out constantly with only short occasional breaks for maintenance and accumulates five times the expected number of cycles the gear is expected to experience in its service lifetime. SLS begins fatigue-testing a given landing gear design well before the aircraft makes its first flight so that the landing gear has accumulated 10,000 testing cycles or more before the aircraft actually flies.

SLS also conducts intense environmental testing of its landing gears. In these tests they are subjected to extremes of temperature ranging from -55 degrees C (-67 F) to 75 degrees C (167 F) and required to demonstrate they can break through a 6mm layer of ice on the landing-gear surface to extend and retract successfully. SLS also tests its landing gears to ensure they can withstand vibration, corrosion, sand and dust, and high intensity radio frequency pulses; and that they can dissipate the charge from a lightning strike without damage and loss of function.

Qualification testing of wheels and brakes falls into similar broad performance, strength, fatigue/endurance and environmental categories. However, the testing goes to even greater extremes than it does for landing gear units, says Emmanuel Colin, VP engineering for Safran Landing Systems’ Wheels & Brakes Division.

SLS carries out wheel and brake performance testing with the wheels turning against cylindrical dynamometers rather than flat surfaces and with “several hundred tonnes” of aircraft-mass equivalent loaded on each wheel and brake. Testing is performed throughout the entire energy range from very low-energy braking during taxiing to well beyond 100 percent of the extremely high-energy braking required in a rejected take-off (RTO) at near-V1 decision speed.

Colin says in beyond-RTO-energy braking tests, SLS applies more than 100 mega-joules of energy to the carbon brakes and each carbon brake, which acts by clamping on to the fast-spinning wheel to which it is attached. The brake thus converts the wheel’s kinetic energy into thermal energy and reaches temperatures of well over 1,000 degrees C (1,832 degrees F), becoming white-hot. Extremely high-energy braking tests result in the destruction of the wheel and brake.

SLS has a highly accurate computer modeling system to confirm each brake and wheel is at exactly the right temperature at all times during braking tests. One important test each wheel-and-brake combination must pass is the ‘fuse plug no melt’ test. This test ensures that, when a carbon brake reaches a certain “very precise” temperature during braking, a fuse plug of alloy within the wheel melts, causing the tire to deflate automatically. This ensures aircraft tires don’t explode during high-energy braking, damaging wings and perhaps causing fuel fires with very hot shrapnel.

A “very dramatic” test SLS conducts on its wheel designs is the ultimate load test, each wheel being forced to bear loads well above the maximum static load of aircraft weight it would ever bear. During this test, the part of the tire between the wheel and the ground is intensely compressed, according to Colin. SLS’ wheel fatigue and endurance tests ensure they can roll throughout the life of the aircraft, each tested wheel being rolled for 80,000km (50,000mi).

In its brake endurance tests, SLS applies maximum brake pressure to each brake more than 200,000 times. SLS also performs endurance tests to demonstrate its brakes’ resistance to corrosion and vibration and (in the case of electrically actuated brakes such as those on the Boeing 787) electromagnetic compatibility with the aircraft and resistance to lightning strikes.

SLS performs environmental testing of its brakes at temperatures ranging from -55 degrees C (-67 F) to 100 degrees C (212 F, the atmospheric-pressure boiling point of water). Environmental testing is also undertaken to demonstrate SLS brake designs work properly in highly humid and icy conditions. These include the brakes being doused with water and de-icing fluid.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999780654907227}",neutral,0.9999780654907227,0
Airbus’s A380 woes deepen as top buyer Emirates delays jets | Mint - Mint,"Wed, 28 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9Db21wYW5pZXMvWlRpbHN1VWhNbnRjblBidlhrdldWSS9BaXJidXNzLUEzODAtd29lcy1kZWVwZW4tYXMtdG9wLWJ1eWVyLUVtaXJhdGVzLWRlbGF5cy1qZXRzLmh0bWzSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGl2ZW1pbnQuY29tL0NvbXBhbmllcy9aVGlsc3VVaE1udGNuUGJ2WGt2V1ZJL0FpcmJ1c3MtQTM4MC13b2VzLWRlZXBlbi1hcy10b3AtYnV5ZXItRW1pcmF0ZXMtZGVsYXlzLWpldHMuaHRtbD9mYWNldD1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Dubai/London: Airbus Group SE’s struggles with its A380 superjumbo are deepening as the planemaker delays deliveries of a dozen aircraft over the next two years to Emirates, the double-decker’s biggest customer.

The delay stems from an agreement between Emirates and engine supplier Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc, Airbus said late on Tuesday, adding that it will accelerate cost cuts at the unit to make up for the financial drag. Handovers of six A380s apiece that were originally planned for 2017 and 2018 will be shifted to a year later following a subsequent accord with Emirates and Airbus, the planemaker said, adding it still plans to deliver about 12 A380s per year as of 2018.

Emirates and Rolls-Royce reached a settlement in early December over the airline’s A380 engine performance and maintenance concerns, after the carrier revealed technical shortcomings a few weeks earlier. The delays compound Airbus’s efforts to turn around the fortunes of the A380, the world’s largest commercial jetliner, which lists for $433 million before the discounts customary in the industry.

Airbus shares fell 0.3% to €62.74 as of 12:03 pm in Paris. That pared the stock’s gain this year to 1.2%, valuing the Toulouse, France-based manufacturer at €48.5 billion ($50.6 billion). Rolls-Royce declined 0.3% in London to 679 pence, for a market value of £12.5 billion ($15.3 billion). State-owned Emirates isn’t traded.

The delays cap a year of negative news for Airbus’s flagship model. An order for A380s from Iran never materialized when that country announced purchases from Airbus in mid-December, meaning the company hasn’t received any advance contracts on the model this year. As a consequence of slack demand, Airbus cut its delivery target for the A380 in July. US competitor Boeing Co. is also having trouble selling its competing 747-8.

Emirates is by far the biggest buyer and operator of the A380, with orders for more than 140 of the plane, configured for 489 to 615 seats. The carrier, also the world’s biggest long-haul airline, is set to take delivery of its first Rolls-Royce-powered version of the jetliner on Wednesday, almost four weeks later than planned. A further two aircraft will be delivered this week, a spokeswoman for Emirates said by e-mail. The carrier will continue to take delivery of A380s as well as Boeing 777s in 2017 and 2018, she said, declining to provide a breakdown.

The Dubai-based carrier switched to Rolls-Royce engines for its latest batch of A380s after relying on General Electric Co.’s Engine Alliance joint venture with Pratt & Whitney for its first 90 orders, the last of which will be delivered early next year.

Winning Emirates as a customer for its Trent 900 engine was a major commercial victory for Rolls-Royce when it was announced in 2015. The contract for 217 powerplants—sufficient to power 50 four-engine planes, plus spares—remains the largest in the history of the UK’s prime manufacturer.

In November, Emirates president Tim Clark revealed that feedback on the powerplants indicated “technical issues"" that needed to be resolved before the first plane would be handed over. Clark said the engines required a “higher intervention rate"" than expected for maintenance, in part due to unanticipated levels of wear to fan blades stemming from their deployment in Dubai’s desert climate. Rolls-Royce will take the full financial brunt of the extra costs, he said in December.

A spokesman for the London-based engine maker said Rolls-Royce will “continue to work with Airbus and Emirates to meet their requirements."" Bloomberg

Airbus wins Canadian FWSAR contract - Skies Magazine,"Thu, 08 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZXNtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLXdpbnMtY2FuYWRpYW4tZndzYXItY29udHJhY3Qv0gFCaHR0cHM6Ly9za2llc21hZy5jb20vbmV3cy9haXJidXMtd2lucy1jYW5hZGlhbi1md3Nhci1jb250cmFjdC8_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Chris Thatcher | December 8, 2016 Chris Thatcher |

Estimated reading time 6 minutes, 52 seconds.

After more than a decade of assessing options, the federal government has selected the Airbus C295W as the Royal Canadian Air Force’s next dedicated fixed-wing search and rescue (FWSAR) aircraft.

Senior government officials made the announcement on Dec. 8, 2016, inside the hangar of 424 Transport and Rescue Squadron at Canadian Forces Base Trenton, Ont., awarding a $2.4 billion contract to Airbus Defence & Space.

“Now, I am starting to believe it is true,” said Fernando Alonso, head of military aircraft at Airbus, who had his doubts about the outcome of the competition until 48 hours before the official announcement.

The contract will be rolled out in two phases. The first includes delivery of 16 aircraft, beginning in 2019 and concluding by 2022, as well as construction of a new training centre in Comox, B.C. The second will cover five years of maintenance and support.

The agreement includes options to provide maintenance and support services for an additional 15 years, bringing the total value to $4.7 billion.

The C295W will replace the RCAF’s aging fleet of CC-115 Buffalos and the CC-130H Hercules assigned to search and rescue (SAR) duty, and will operate from the air force’s current bases in Greenwood, N.S., Trenton, Winnipeg, Man., and Comox.

The C295W features two Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127G turboprop engines, Airbus Defence and Space’s fully integrated tactical system (FITS), and an L-3 Wescam advanced electro-optical/infrared turret system, which recently surpassed 1,000 flight hours on all Airbus C295 maritime patrol aircraft. CAE will construct and deliver the training centre while Provincial Aerospace, under a joint venture with Airbus called AirPro, will provide the in-service support.

The advanced integrated radar and sensors, along with sophisticated communications and data management systems, will allow technicians to track up to 200 search objects simultaneously and share that data in real time with other air, land and sea assets.

“I believe this new fleet, with the ability to fully integrate with our SAR partners, will fundamentally change the SAR paradigm for us,” said LGen Mike Hood, commander of the RCAF, noting the aircraft’s sensor capability and increased endurance. “I believe search and rescue is going to become a lot less about search and a lot more about rescue.”

“This aircraft is a game-changer for search and rescue in Canada,” said Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, after noting the harsh and remote conditions in which SAR operators work, an 18-million square-kilometre area of responsibility that extends from the Pacific Ocean to the North Pole and deep into the North Atlantic. “It represents a great technological improvement of our [SAR] capabilities for the future.”

Unlike previous defence procurement projects that have usually specified the quantity of equipment and supporting infrastructure required, Public Services and Procurement took a different approach, inviting bidders to propose a “complete search and rescue service,” according to Minister Judy Foote, that included the number of aircraft and bases as well as a maintenance program that would ensure availability to meet the RCAF’s needs.

“If you ask industry, this was the first time they have ever been so engaged,” said Foote, noting that Canadian companies have the expertise to solve some defence challenges. “[We] have reached out to industry…[because] we want to reap the maximum benefit for Canadian companies and Canadians.”

The fixed-wing search and rescue (FWSAR) project was first announced in 2003 and at various times attracted up to seven potential bidders, including Bombardier, Viking Air, Lockheed Martin, Bell-Boeing, Leonardo (formerly Alenia), Embraer Defence and Airbus.

When the request for proposals closed in January 2016, however, the C295 was one of three, along with the Leonardo C-27J Spartan, an early favourite when the project was first launched, and the Embraer KC-390, a late entrant that is still under development in Brazil.

Both the C295W and C-27J were deemed compliant. But after a fair and open competition, “it came down to the cost,” said Foote.

Team Spartan, which included a joint venture between Leonardo Aircraft and General Dynamics Mission Systems-Canada, released a statement saying it had no comment on the contract award pending a debrief.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996805191040039}",neutral,0.9996805191040039,0

Airbus has revealed a radical design for future airplane cabins – modules (pictured) that can be customized to fit the needs of each flight

SWAPPABLE CABINS Airbus has revealed a radical design that lets airlines customize the inside of the plane cabins to fit the need of each flight. Called Transpose, this concept separates the interior into individuals modules that can host different layouts. When the plan reaches its final destination, staff can easily unload the separated modular and customize them for the needs of the next flight. The firm envisions gyms, spas, playgrounds, coffee shops, more first class seating and more in the modules. Airbus would use already existing cargo planes for this project.

'To create new passenger experience possibilities, we must first work to simplify the process of customizing aircraft cabins,' Jason Chua, project executive at Airbus, shared in a blog post.

'We're doing this with the development of a modular aircraft cabin, and by giving the ecosystem of airlines, manufacturers, passengers and regulators the tools to rapidly bring more diverse experiences to market.'

Airlines usually change their cabins every seven to 10 years due to the time consuming and rigorous process.

Even when the interior is updated, it is mostly conservative and incremental improvements.

However, Chua reveals that the firm is taking an 'ecosystem' approach with their design, which could make Transpose both 'achievable and pragmatic'.

'First and foremost, we believe that this project will enable entirely new categories of passenger experiences, making your time spent in the sky more interesting, personalized, and enjoyable,' he writes.

'Additionally, we’re taking an ecosystem approach to this challenge, drawing upon expertise and leveraging best practices from multiple industries.'

And if Airbus is successful in this venture, Chua said it will 'reduce the time it takes to customize an aircraft cabin by a factor of three, and take the speed of aircraft reconfiguration from weeks to hours, or even minutes'.

When the plane reaches its final destination, staff can easily unload the separated modular interior and customize each section for the needs of the next flight.

'Imagine an afternoon flight landing at San Jose airport,' Chua explains.

'The passengers deplane, and within minutes the seats in the cabin are being swapped out for bunks, making the aircraft's next route: a 12 hour redeye to Singapore — a much more restful experience for passengers.'

The idea is that there will not be a first class, business class or coach sections - it would be an open floor plan where each section houses a different experience for passengers. And the firm would use already existing freighter variants of large commercial aircraft

'That same plane could then be used for a short flight to Macau — in which the airline could swap out a sleeper cabin for a spa chain, ready to service vacationers eager to start their travels refreshed.'

The idea is that there will not be a first class, business class or coach sections - it would be an open floor plan where each section houses a different experience for passengers.

Turning this concept into a reality wouldn't require Airbus to design an entirely new craft.

The firm would use already existing freighter variants of large commercial aircraft, as the cabins are already empty, which would easily let the firm fill it with the swappable sections.

Besides offering passengers a more comfortable and enjoyable experience, Transpose would also save money for airlines.

Adopting a modular cabin architecture would eliminate aircraft downtime due to customization operations – a process that takes up to a month to complete.

Transpose would also allow manufactures to finish and delivery planes much faster than ever before.

PATENT HIGHLIGHTS TRANSPOSE In 2015, Airbus was awarded a patent for detachable cabins that could cut down the amount of times it takes to board a plane. To reduce a plane's turnaround time, Airbus suggests 'a removable cabin module, comprising a floor, an upper aircraft fuselage portion connected to the floor, and a first and a second end wall. Airbus was awarded a patent (pictured) in 2015 for 'detachable cabins', which suggests the firm has been working on Transpose for quite some time ‘The first and second end walls, the floor and the upper aircraft fuselage portion form a cabin for transport of passengers, luggage, freight or combinations thereof.' It suggests that passengers could be seated in the detachable cabins while they are still docked at a gate. The entire cabin can then be lowered and attached to the plane. When passengers land, their cabin is removed and immediately replaced with another, fully loaded cabin. Airbus says the 'aircraft pod concept' means 'passengers could be pre-seated in cabin pods before the plane actually arrives, ready for integration on the aircraft, saving time and making processing much simpler.'

'Currently, work on cabin interiors can't begin until the final weeks of the manufacturing process, but modular cabin interiors could be developed on a parallel timetable with the core fabrication of the aircraft itself,' Chua writes.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997468590736389}",neutral,0.9997468590736389,0

Marenco Swisshelicopter company founder steps down - Vertical Mag - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 07 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvbWFyZW5jby1zd2lzc2hlbGljb3B0ZXItY29tcGFueS1mb3VuZGVyLXN0ZXBzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Marenco Swisshelicopter CEO Martin Stucki has stepped down from his role at the company he created.

In a press release issued Dec. 7, Marenco Swisshelicopter’s board of directors confirmed that Stucki has “retired from his functions” at the company as of Dec. 5, 2016.

Effective Jan. 1, 2017, he will be replaced by Andreas Loewenstein, who served in various roles at EADS and Eurocopter (now Airbus Group and Airbus Helicopters, respectively) before joining the French naval systems manufacturer DCNS in 2010. Marenco chief operating officer Bruno Gubser will lead the company in the interim.

Stucki is the visionary behind Marenco’s flagship product, the SKYe SH09, a light single-engine helicopter that aims to compete with more established aircraft including the Airbus Helicopters H125 and Bell 407. An engineer and commercial helicopter pilot, Stucki began developing the concept for the clean-sheet SH09 in 2002, formally launching Marenco Swisshelicopter in 2007.

The company’s identity is closely tied to Stucki. The name Marenco comes from “Martin Engineering and Consulting,” and its headquarters in Pfäffikon, Switzerland, occupies a farmhouse that has been in Stucki’s family for four generations, and continues to serve as Stucki’s primary residence.

In its press release, Marenco’s board of directors expressed its “gratitude to Martin Stucki for his visionary ideas, relentless efforts and entrepreneurial spirit that led [Marenco Swisshelicopter] from a most respected engineering bureau to the brink of becoming a full-fledged player in the helicopter industry.”

The release went on to say, “The board of directors is convinced that Andreas Loewenstein together with the [Marenco Swisshelicopter] management and employees will accelerate the transition from a technology pioneer to the first Swiss global helicopter provider and manufacturer.”

The board confirmed that it remains committed to the company’s Swiss roots and to expanding its business activities in Switzerland. A company spokesperson told Vertical, “The change of management does not affect our plans in terms of locations and we will continue as planned, specifically with Mollis where we have invested significantly and started the construction of the 4,000-square-meter [43,055-square-foot] assembly facility.”

The spokesperson also told Vertical that the company continues to plan for initial type certification of the SKYe SH09 by the European Aviation Safety Agency in late 2017, with first customer deliveries in 2018. Swiss company Air Zermatt and Canadian operator Horizon Helicopters have previously been named as launch customers for the aircraft.

Loewenstein has 25 years of business development and strategy in the European helicopter and high-tech industries, having initially joined the French aerospace manufacturer Aérospatiale in 1991, according to his LinkedIn profile. From 1994, he served as group vice president, strategy and business development for Eurocopter before overseeing the post-merger integration process of EADS Group from 1999 to 2002.

In the summer of 2002, he returned to Eurocopter, serving as deputy executive VP in charge of commercial programs and external relations, and then senior VP of strategy and company development. Since joining DCNS in 2010, he has served as executive VP of strategy and development, and executive VP of strategy partnership and innovation.

According to the Marenco press release, Loewenstein will relocate to the Zurich area with his wife and three children to assume his new role.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999828338623047}",neutral,0.9999828338623047,0
"Airbus chosen to build Canada's new search planes, ending 12-year procurement odyssey - CBC News","Thu, 08 Dec 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL3BvbGl0aWNzL2ZpeGVkLXdpbmctc2VhcmNoLXBsYW5lcy0xLjM4ODU2NTPSASBodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYmMuY2EvYW1wLzEuMzg4NTY1Mw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Liberal government has chosen the Airbus C-295 transport as Canada's next fixed-wing search-and-rescue plane, in a two-step procurement process that will cost taxpayers $4.7 billion over the next two decades.

The selection of European defence giant Airbus ends a 12-year, frustrating odyssey that spans three governments.

Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan, Public Works Minister Judy Foote and the commander of the Royal Canadian Air Force, Lt.-Gen. Michael Hood, announced the deal Thursday at the country's largest military air base, in Trenton, Ont., which is also one of the principal search and rescue stations.

The first phase — at a cost of $2.4 billion — involves the purchase of 16 C-295W aircraft modified for search-and-rescue missions.

A training simulator, to be located in Comox, B.C., and 11 years of in-service support and maintenance will be included. The maintenance will be handled by PAL Aerospace in Newfoundland and Labrador.

An additional in-service support program will have to be negotiated with Airbus, at an estimated cost of $2.3 billion.

Airbus wins $4.8 billion for search and rescue fleet Duration 2:57 Ministers Judy Foote and Harjit Sajjan were on hand to announce the government's purchase of 16 new search and rescue aircraft from Airbus.

Taken together, the combined price tag is considerably more than the $3.8 billion approved by the former Conservative government in 2011, and higher than the original $3.1 billion cost affixed to the plan when Paul Martin's government first announced it in 2004.

""Whether it is in mountainous terrain, in the middle of the Atlantic or over the Arctic, the C-295 is the modern and versatile aircraft we need,"" Sajjan said Thursday.

The turbo-prop C-295 is in use in 15 countries, mostly for military transport, but also for maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare.

Elimination of operating base considered

There were three companies in the running: Alenia Aermacchi North America (now rebranded as Leonardo-Finmeccanica), Airbus Defence and Space, and Embraer, a Brazilian aerospace firm.

In a statement, a representative with Leonardo-Finmeccanica would only say that the company has been informed it is not the winner and will take some time to avail itself of a ""debrief"" from government officials before commenting.

The hybrid procurement was intended to deliver not only aircraft, but recommendations on how many planes are needed and where to station them.

The companies were asked to submit prices and aircraft numbers for a fleet that would operate out of at least four main bases across the country — Greenwood, N.S., Trenton, Winnipeg and Comox, B.C. — and a separate proposal using only three airfields.

But the announcement Thursday looks more like a straightforward procurement.

The high cost — political and financial — of dropping one of the main operating bases was, according to defence sources, a non-starter for a government that is already being knocked around over its handling of the fighter jet replacement.

The air force, which had been accused in the past of favouring the Leonardo-built C-27J, fully got behind the Liberal government's decision on Thursday.

""Thanks to the sensors and systems aboard this new fleet of aircraft, I believe search and rescue is going to become a lot less about search and more about rescue,"" said Lt.-Gen. Mike Hood. ""The C-295 more than meets the requirements of the Royal Canadian Air Force.""

Replacing 50-year-old planes

The new planes are meant to replace the air force's nearly 50-year-old CC-115 Buffalos and older model CC-130 Hercules transports currently assigned to search-and-rescue duties.

Foote says the first planes are expected to arrive in 2019 and the final delivery will take place in 2022 — 18 years after they were originally ordered.

Paul Martin's Liberal government started the competition in 2004.

""It boggles the mind,"" said Alan Williams, who was the head of military procurement when the federal Finance Department approached National Defence, saying it had $1 billion to spend on equipment for the Forces.

Fixed-wing search-and-rescue planes were an obvious choice, he said.

""The minister gets up in the House and basically says, 'We need new airplanes to find people who are lost and save them.' It was a no-brainer from that perspective,"" said Williams.

Accusations of bid-rigging

But just before the Conservatives were elected in 2006, the program stalled over accusations from defence contractors that the air force had rigged the specifications in favour of the C-27J.

Former defence minister Peter MacKay declared the purchase of fixed-wing search and rescue planes as a No. 1 priority in 2008. (Canadian Press)

The air force has long denied the allegation, but in 2012 the top brass pitched the former Conservative government on buying surplus U.S. C-27Js.

Williams says there's an important lesson in the long-drawn-out fiasco.

""The military has to know and has to be told"" on this project and other that their job is to define requirements for equipment needs and it's the government's job to hold an open, fair tender and pick the winner, he said. ""And that's it.""

Protecting military from themselves

Commenting on the issue of new fighter planes, he said, ""I have no doubt the air force wants the F-35. I can understand that. I have no doubt the air force wanted the C-27J. I can understand that, too.

""But that's why it's incumbent on the assistant deputy minister of materiel, the deputy minister and the minister to safeguard the process and protect the military — actually — from themselves.""

Former defence minister Peter MacKay said in December 2008 that the search planes were his top procurement priority, but the effort bogged down and it was eventually referred to the National Research Council for analysis.

The council agreed the military's specifications were far too specific and needed to be broadened in order to ensure competition.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999957084655762}",neutral,0.9999957084655762,0
