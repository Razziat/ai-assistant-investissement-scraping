Rolls-Royce to Replace Engines of Superjumbo Airbus Jets - Voice of America - VOA News,"Sun, 14 Nov 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2EvYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtZW5naW5lcy1tYXktbmVlZC1yZXBsYWNlbWVudC0tMTA4MTg4MzY5LzE2ODkyNy5odG1s0gFbaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm9hbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL2FpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLWVuZ2luZXMtbWF5LW5lZWQtcmVwbGFjZW1lbnQtLTEwODE4ODM2OS8xNjg5MjcuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Associated Press reports Monday that Rolls-Royce will temporarily replace entire engines on A380 Superjumbo jets, after an oil leak in an engine earlier this month caused a fire in the engine and a catastrophic failure.

British jet-engine maker Rolls-Royce would not comment on the report that it would swap out entire engines on A380 Superjumbo jets.



The company said it stands by its earlier statement that an engine fire in a QANTAS airliner was caused by a specific component in the turbine area, but declined to name the component. Industry analyst Howard Wheeldon said swapping out engines could take some time.



""It suggests that this is a three, six or maybe nine-month job to get these aircraft back in the air as opposed to and earlier hope that if could be just a few weeks,"" said Wheeldon.



Qantas has grounded its six A380s, after finding oil leaks in three of them. A QANTAS spokesman called its approach conservative. Wheeldon agrees.



""Perfectly understandable that QANTAS should want answers to what is still an unexplained problem, and to ensure that the engines in service in the future will not come up against a similar problem.""



Singapore Airlines and Lufthansa checked their planes and returned all but one to service. Wheeldon said that was a logical decision. ""We must remember that this was not a crash, this was an incident where one engine failed, there are three others, this aircraft can fly on two engines. Now obviously one does not want to see an incident like this, but the company [has] got to the bottom of it very quickly.""



This report, though, spells bad financial news for Rolls-Royce, said Wheeldon.



""Clearly the stock has already suffered, it came back on a positive front Friday after the announcement. I think we are going to see some drift here until the day comes that they can tell us that this is firmly behind them.""



A Rolls-Royce would not comment on how long repairs would take, as it would depend on how a specific airline wanted repairs to proceed. The company also would not comment on whether this would delay delivery of A380s expected to go into service in 2011.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.82314532995224}",negative,0.82314532995224,-1
Airbus seeks engine compensation - Al Jazeera English,"Thu, 18 Nov 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vZWNvbm9teS8yMDEwLzExLzE4L2FpcmJ1cy1zZWVrcy1lbmdpbmUtY29tcGVuc2F0aW9u0gFRaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWxqYXplZXJhLmNvbS9hbXAvZWNvbm9teS8yMDEwLzExLzE4L2FpcmJ1cy1zZWVrcy1lbmdpbmUtY29tcGVuc2F0aW9u?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aircraft manufacturer wants Rolls Royce to compensate it for production delays following engine blowout on Qantas plane.

A recent mid-air engine blowout aboard a Qantas Airbus A380 has sparked widespread concerns over air safety [AFP]

Airbus has said it will seek compensation from Rolls Royce after one of the British manufacturer’s engines failed on a Qantas A380 superjumbo.

The European aircraft maker said on Thursday that current production was “far from normal” and it was incurring additional costs due to Rolls Royce’s engine problem.

“We will seek financial compensation from Rolls Royce,” an Airbus spokesman said.

Rolls Royce said last week that the failure of a “specific component in the turbine area of the engine” caused the fire and mid-air blowout on the Qantas flight over Indonesia shortly after it took off for Sydney.

The partial disintegration of the engine mid-flight forced the jet, which had hundreds of passengers on board, to make an emergency landing in Singapore.

Engine replacement

Airbus’ move follows a statement by Qantas earlier on Thursday that Rolls Royce may have to replace up to 40 such engines across various carriers’ A380 fleets.

“Rolls-Royce are still working through the criteria for which engines need to be changed,” Alan Joyce, the Qantas chief executive, said in Sydney.

“… with an issue as complicated as this, Rolls Royce has no choice [but to ask Airbus to return some A380 engines]” Howard Wheeldon, analyst, BGC Partners

It is believed that around 80 Trent 900 engines are currently in use, or about to be commissioned.

Qantas, Singapore Airlines and Germany’s Lufthansa all fly Airbus A380s powered by the same engines.

A spokesman for Airbus said: “I can confirm that Rolls-Royce is arranging to supply some new engines from the production line to replace some engines removed from the serviced aircraft.”

The Airbus A380, which cost $16.3bn to develop but has struggled to attract airlines in major markets, is the world’s largest passenger aircraft with an average list price of about $350m.

Peter Harbison, the executive chairman for the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation, told Al Jazeera that the engine failure was “still something that’s obviously reflecting fairly badly on the manufacturer”.

“It’s rather uncertain what’s exactly involved [in replacing the engines],” he said.

“If it’s replacement of 40 engines, that’s a big and time-consuming production. If it’s modification, then it’s not quite such an issue, as long as they get it right this time.”

Rolls Royce’s move could be another blow to a much-delayed A380 programme as Airbus was scheduled to deliver more than a dozen Rolls Royce-powered A380s – primarily to Singapore Airlines, Qantas and Lufthansa by the end of next year.

But both Singapore Airlines and Qantas, with a combined 22 A380s still to be delivered, said on Tuesday they had not been informed of any delivery delays.

Customer reaction

Laurence Barron, Airbus’ China chief, said the first delivery to China Southern Airlines Co Ltd, China’s first A380 customer, would also go ahead as planned for next summer.

Airlines using the Rolls Royce Trent 900 engines have been ordered by European aviation authorities to undertake major tests, which analysts said were so strenuous they would likely disrupt schedules.

Shares in Rolls Royce, which on Friday said fixing the fault would lead to only slightly slower profit growth, have suffered during its probe.

They were 0.2 per cent down at 596.50 pence by 11:30 GMT on Tuesday, around nine per cent below their last trade before the Qantas incident.

Airbus parent company EADS has lost five per cent since the incident and hit a one-month low on Monday. Its shares were 1.3 per cent down at 17.78 euros.

Qantas is down 4.9 per cent since the incident.

“I suppose with an issue as complicated as this, Rolls Royce has no choice [but to ask Airbus to return some A380 engines]”, Howard Wheeldon, a BGC Partners analyst, said.

He said there would “definitely be a financial hit” for Rolls Royce because of the move.

Airbus said last week that the problem with the Rolls Royce engine could have an impact on its earnings and delivery target for 2011 but did not give details, and airlines contacted on Tuesday had no knowledge of delivery timetable changes.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.5103954076766968}",negative,0.5103954076766968,-1
Qantas Airbus 380 uncontained engine failure - The Aviationist,"Thu, 04 Nov 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlYXZpYXRpb25pc3QuY29tLzIwMTAvMTEvMDQvcWFudGFzLWFpcmJ1cy0zODAtdW5jb250YWluZWQtZW5naW5lLWZhaWx1cmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Two months ago, commenting about the uncontained engine failure involving the Qantas B747-400 just departed from San Francisco (for details read here) I wrote: “Unlike other minor failures occuring almost daily everywhere, an uncontained failure (that is quite different from an engine explosion….), is somehow rare, but not a big deal (if there’s no damage to the wing or fuselage caused by a separated engine part), especially if happening in the vicinity of the departure airport”. What happened to QF32, an Airbus A380 from Singapore to Sydney somehow prov e that such kind of emergency is not as rare at least for Qantas aircraft…. On Nov. 4, 2010, Airbus 380 “VH-OQA”, the first A380-800 flying with Qantas, with 433 passengers and 26 crew members on board, experienced an uncontained engine failure 30 minutes after departure from Singapore and was compelled to return to Changi airport where it performed a successful emergency landing after circling above the sea for fuel dumping. Parts from the #2 engine punctured the left wing while debris fell on the ground (fortunately, nobody was hurt). Even if the cause of the failure is obviously still unknown, as a consequence of the engine problem Qantas grounded its seven Airbus 380s, to be followed, according to rumors, by the Singapore and Lufthansa ones in the next few h ours (Qantas, Singarpore and Lufthansa A380s are equipped with the Rolls Royce Trent 900 variant power plant – while Air France and Emirates are powered by Engine Alliance GP7200 engines). Since I’ve not heard latelyabout similar events involving aircraft of other airlines, what happened to QF32 raises a question: what’s wrong in the Rolls Royce – Qantas duo? Perhaps nothing. Perhaps Qantas planes with Rolls Royce engines had just bad luck but investigation will have to analyse also airline’s maintenance procedures as well as engine design and type of material used to build engine components at RR.

So, what have we learnt so far from this event?

1) engine failures happens (on 4 engine aircraft but also on 2 or 3 engine planes – the number of engines is statistically irrelevant)

2) uncontained engine failures are not so dangerous, provided they don’t cause damages to the wing or fuselage

3) in the last two occurrences, the “uncontainment” happened few minutes after departure (hence, in such a phase of flight in which stress on engine is at the highest level)

4) aircraft experiencing this type of emergency can return to the departure aerodrome safely

5) this was the most serious incident worldwide involving an A380 since it entered service three years ago

6) aircraft parts sometimes fall from the sky (as in Donnie Darko movie….) so be careful :)

"Rolls-Royce to replace ""up to 40"" engines on Airbus A380s - FRANCE 24 English","Thu, 18 Nov 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi8yMDEwMTExOC1yb2xscy1yb3ljZS1yZXBsYWNlLWVuZ2luZXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzODBzLWF2aWF0aW9uLXNhZmV0eS1xYW50YXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"AVIATION

Rolls-Royce announced Thursday that they are to replace as many as 40 engines across the Airbus A380 fleet of passenger aircraft, following safety fears sparked by a mid-air explosion on board a Singapore Airlines flight earlier this month.

AFP - Rolls-Royce may replace up to 40 engines on Airbus A380 superjumbos flown by three airlines, Qantas said Thursday, after a mid-air explosion sparked safety fears over the world's biggest passenger jet.

The number accounts for nearly half the Trent 900 engines powering A380s operated by Qantas, Singapore Airlines and Germany's Lufthansa, and follows extensive checks after the November 4 blast over Indonesia.

""Rolls may have to look at replacing up to 40 engines across the entire A380 fleet,"" a Qantas spokeswoman told AFP.

""That includes the Singapore fleet and the Lufthansa fleet. Obviously Qantas doesn't have 40 engines to replace, we only have six aircraft with four engines each,"" she added.

Qantas chief Alan Joyce said that up to 14 of the airline's A380 engines could potentially need to be replaced, leaving it unclear when its fleet of A380s will resume flying their routes to Los Angeles and London.

Rolls-Royce had already been in the process of modifying the engines to prevent oil leaks, but none of Qantas's turbines had been updated, Joyce said.

Australia's national carrier grounded all six of its A380s following the explosion, which forced an emergency landing in Singapore. Qantas earlier said it will need at least three new engines after safety checks found oil leaks.

Singapore Airlines has grounded three of its 11 A380s and Lufthansa is changing an engine on one of its three superjumbos as a precaution, while other A380 operators use turbines made by different manufacturers.

""Rolls-Royce are still working through the criteria for which engines need to be changed,"" Joyce told reporters.

""We're hoping to understand precisely which engines need to be replaced and therefore we can have a firm timeline for when they will be back in the air, but we are still a few days away from that,"" he added.

Joyce said the British manufacturer had modified the Trent 900 engine to stop oil leaks before the blast and ""if this incident hadn't occurred, eventually all these engines would have had this modification"".

""It doesn't look like it is a significant modification, but it is a modification that has an impact on how the engines are performing,"" he said.

""If this was significant, and was known to be significant, we would have liked to have known about that,"" he added.

Qantas would discuss compensation for disruptions to its schedule with Rolls-Royce once the A380s returned to service, Joyce said. Rolls-Royce was not immediately available to respond to the latest comments.

Rolls-Royce has pinpointed a ""specific component"" in the Trent 900 as the cause of an oil fire behind the November 4 blast. Each A380 is powered by four engines.

The Qantas spokeswoman said she was unable to give a ""definitive answer"" on when its Airbus superjumbo would return to the skies, refusing to confirm a report which said it could remain out of action until at least early December.

A new-for-old engine swap programme was among options being discussed with Rolls-Royce to speed up the resumption of A380 services, she added.

Joyce said the A380 issues had reduced Qantas's flying capacity by between four and five percent.

The double-decker A380, which carries 525 passengers and weighs 560 tonnes at takeoff, was hailed as the future of long-haul aviation at its commercial launch in 2007.

Rival manufacturer Boeing's Dreamliner is about three years behind schedule after a series of glitches, including an on-board fire last week which forced it to cancel test flights.

Airbus A350 XWB update - Reinforced Plastics,"Tue, 16 Nov 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlaW5mb3JjZWRwbGFzdGljcy5jb20vY29udGVudC9mZWF0dXJlcy9haXJidXMtYTM1MC14d2ItdXBkYXRlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A350 XWB (extra wide body), the aircraft that Airbus Industrie did not want to build, is now visibly taking shape, propelled by fully committed engineering and management teams within Airbus itself and throughout its supply chain. George Marsh reviews the project so far.

In September, Airbus flight tested an A350 XWB fuselage panel made from CFRP. The 15 m² structure was fitted in place of an existing A340 aluminium fuselage section. The trials was designed to evaluate acoustic properties and to help fine-tune sound insulation for the A350 XWB cabin. (Picture © Airbus.)

A350 XWB fuselage material choice.

In responding to Boeing’s radical B787 Dreamliner, Airbus first hoped it could get away with an upgraded development of its established A330 twin, but this concept cut little ice with potential customers so the European company had to think again. Ultimately, it put forward an altogether new aircraft, gaining competitive edge by giving it a wider fuselage than that of the B787 (hence ‘XWB’).

Airbus leaders had to backtrack on their previous assertions that Boeing was foolish to adopt a reinforced plastic fuselage for its Dreamliner. Plastic fuselages are an undoubted challenge because previous commercial passenger jet fuselages have been metal and no-one knew how best to fabricate a large composite pressure vessel that has to accommodate hundreds of passengers. Nor was it clear how such a plastic fuselage would behave in service. Unknowns range from the likely effects of fatigue on a structure subject to repeated thermal and pressure cycles, to detection of damage in composites and subsequent repairability.

Yet, stung by Boeing’s bold adoption of a predominantly composite airframe, including the fuselage, Airbus has followed suit, notably specifying reinforced plastics for its wide ovoid fuselage as well as wings, empennage and other primary aerostructure. In fact, the billed 53% composite content of the A350 slightly trumps the 50% of the B787. The European contender is 53% composite, 19% aluminium-lithium, 14% titanium, 6% steel and 8% other materials.

Of course, operators are not interested in competition around plastic content for its own sake, but are keen to have the weight and performance benefits that composites can bring. Reassured that Airbus has recovered from its wrong-footing by Boeing, 35 customers have (at time of writing) ordered 573 A350 XWBs. (Airbus claims this number of firm orders and another 80 commitments.) Something around 600 copies is a creditable tally given that the aircraft was officially launched in 2006, more than three years after the B787.

Composites advantage

Airbus believes it has advantages in the composites arena. For a start, while Boeing has had to make a large jump from barely 10% composites content in its B777 airliner to the B787’s 50% figure, Airbus was an early composites adopter and has gained expertise while progressively adding fairings, nacelles, empennages, control surfaces and wings to its composite structures portfolio. It now has extensive experience of reinforced plastics fabrication and service behaviour, while composites engineers on the A350 programme benefit also from the 15% plastic content in the Airbus A380 ‘superjumbo’. Admittedly, Airbus might still have preferred to maintain its more incremental approach to composites adoption but, goaded by its competitor, it is now fully committed to the plastic fuselage revolution. Although low-weight metal solutions, primarily aluminium/lithium alloy and metal/composite hybrids such as GLARE, were considered, composites won out because of the prospects for greater integration, fewer parts and fasteners, lower maintenance and, it seems, the favourable attitude of airlines to the precedent set by Boeing.

Paradoxically, the European planemaker gains from not being the leader in this particular airframe race since it can learn much from the problems experienced by Boeing that have led to a likely three-year delay in first deliveries of B787s. Although the A350 programme is facing delays of its own, so far these are of the order of months rather than years. With first deliveries and service entry likely in 2014, the new Airbus should not be nearly as far behind its competitor in terms of its availability as was once anticipated.

Broadly, the A350 family will comprise three aircraft sizes; the A350-800, A350-900 and A350-1000 designed variously to carry 270 to 350 passengers (up to 400+ in the highest-density configuration). The aircraft was conceived as an A330/340 replacement and will compete with larger variants of Boeing’s new B787 and its existing B777 long-range widebody twin. All A350s will have a range in excess of 8,000 nautical miles. The variants will share a largely common wing design and wing span though the -1000 model will have a 4% larger wing area, achieved by extending the trailing section aft.

Intensive development

An intensive development effort has achieved significant milestones. One, reached in December 2008, was Maturity Gate 5 (MG 5), the point at which the aircraft configuration is considered fully defined. MG5 cleared the way for detailed design of components and enabled production of jigs and tooling to commence for long-lead items. This is crucial in the case of composites, for which production requires early commitments to tool manufacturers. Airbus regularly updates its data to these suppliers and many of the required tools are now available. The Maturity A milestone, which encompasses MG5 and earlier gates, was followed last year by Maturity B, by which point all design teams had finalised their designs.

Today the A350 XWB is progressing steadily from the design and development phase towards production. Airbus has assembled a detailed digital model of the aircraft for use as a common reference for component manufacture by its own sites and its suppliers. Rather than rely too much on this, however, the airframer has also implemented a demonstrator programme under which a physical mock-ups of the fuselage, wing and other major structures are being produced. A350 programme head Didier Evrard describes this activity as an essential ‘bridge between the digital model and the real world,’ important for validating composite production processes as manufacture ramps up towards the 10 aircraft per month rate targeted.

A modified production strategy for the A350 sees Airbus relying on a select group of Tier 1 supplier/partners chosen for their ability to shoulder full responsibility for delivering large pre-assemblies that are complete and ready for assembly into the final aircraft. It has not gone quite as far down the dispersed outsourcing track as Boeing first aimed to do and, by maintaining closer supervision within its partnership arrangements, hopes to avoid the supply chain pitfalls that have afflicted the Dreamliner programme.

The biggest difference in approach between the airframers, however, is that related to fuselage manufacture. Whereas Boeing is producing the B787 fuselage in large monolithic tape-wound barrel sections that are subsequently joined, Airbus has opted to clothe a pre-fabricated fuselage skeleton with large carbon fibre composite panels. This less radical solution reduces risk, says Airbus, while also having the advantage that panel properties can be optimised to their locations in the fuselage (whether crown, belly or sides) with resultant weight saving. Other benefits include easier handling, less expensive autoclaves and the fact that having a panel fail at post-manufacture inspection for any reason is less of a setback than losing a complete barrel. Stringers and most frames are of carbon, though certain frames in high load areas are titanium so that crashworthiness criteria can be met. Airbus reversed an earlier decision to use metal stringers in favour of co-curing carbon stringers within the skin panels. This reduces the number of separately fabricated parts and fasteners. Crossbeams, however, are of aluminium-lithium.

The nose section is only partly composite, metal having been retained because the one-piece carbon fibre structure that had earlier been considered would have required titanium reinforcement to meet bird strike requirements, making it uncompetitive on cost.

Airbus Hamburg is responsible for fuselage development and final assembly, with an associate plant at nearby Stade producing some carbon fibre panels. Centre fuselage build-up takes place at the Aerolia (formerly Airbus) site in Saint-Nazaire, France, using upper and lower shells provided by Spirit AeroSystems Inc in North Carolina, USA.

Wings are produced mainly in the UK (Filton and Broughton), while the centre wing box is manufactured at Nantes in France. However, Spirit AeroSystems is responsible for the wing fixed leading edge including the front wing spar, a 105 ft long composite structure weighing some 2000 lb. Tailplane (empennage) components are being produced by Airbus Spain and Germany, and in China. Final assembly of the aircraft will take place in Toulouse, France.

Many of the production facilities, including those for composites, are new. A €150 million fuselage assembly hangar at Hamburg, with a production area of some 15 000 m2, was completed this summer. At a ceremony in July a topping out wreath decorated with carbon fibre was a symbolically appropriate part of the occasion. A new composite production facility at Stade currently has a workforce of about 100, but this is expected to grow to nearer 500 as production builds up to full rate. In July, Spirit AeroSystems formally opened a new 46 500 m2 composite manufacturing facility in Kinston, North Carolina, after a two-year construction phase. By now, some 200 people there are engaged on Airbus work, a tally that is expected to rise to about 700 over the next few years.

The A350 has a wing and centre wing box that are more extensively composite (about 80%) than on previous Airbus aircraft and the production arrangements reflect this. With majority production of the wings taking place in the UK, Airbus has expanded its capability at Broughton, North Wales, with a new 46 000 m2 factory dedicated to A350 XWB wing production. Wing design and engineering take place at the Airbus UK site at Filton, Bristol.

Broughton is due to commence assembly of the first wing about now. According to Brian Fleet, head of the wing programme, the British operations had to fight hard to keep wing production in the UK and have committed to efficiency improvements aimed at cutting cost by around 30%.

Parts of the wing are manufactured elsewhere. The role of Spirit AeroSystems in producing the fixed portion of the forward part of the wing, including the forward spar, has already been mentioned. GKN Aerospace has invested substantially in the site at Filton that it acquired from Airbus in 2008. Here, co-located with the Airbus wing design activity, it is setting up to produce the entire portion of the wing aft of and including the rear spar, except the wing skins which are being manufactured in mainland Europe and certain trailing edge components being made by GE Aviation at Hamble near Southampton in the UK.

Dozens of organisations around the world are involved in the supply chain. Aerolia, the French aerostructures specialist that emerged out of Airbus in 2009, is responsible for A350 nose and fuselage structures in both metal and composite, and has invested €160 million in a new composites facility. Its own supply chain tail includes Corse Composites (landing gear doors), Latecoere (nose fairing), plus a number of design associates. In Germany, Premium Aerotec, a similarly semi-autonomous EADS subsidiary, is producing much of the forward fuselage plus parts of the aft fuselage including the side shells, floor grid and aft pressure bulkhead. Its investment of some €360 million in the programme has included €6.5 million on a new 25 m long by 8 m high South Korea-built autoclave weighing 260 tonnes. This is installed at a new production hall at Augsberg.

Figeac Aero, also in France, is to manufacture floor sections under sub-contract to Aerolia while FACC AG, the Austrian company now majority owned by the Xian Aircraft Industry Group, has a contract to produce blended winglets along with a number of other A350 components. The Duqueine Group, France, is to fabricate fuselage frames for Premium Aerotec and Aerolia, plus window frames for Spirit AeroSystems. Frame production work has also gone to Alliant Techsystems (ATK) in the United States, along with manufacture of fuselage stringers. ATK recently spent €175 million on expanding its composite production facilities.

China’s Avicopter, one of the country’s composite leaders, has a joint venture (JV) with Airbus parent EADS to produce A350 rudders in a new factory at the Harbin Hafei Airbus Composite Manufacturing Centre. This JV is also to produce A350 elevators, under contract to Aernnova Aerospace in Spain. Airbus and China have an understanding that 5% of the A350’s airframe should be built in China, a commitment that was fully fulfilled with the recent allocation of wing spoiler and droop panel manufacture to Chinese companies. Another EADS joint venture is that with German company SGL to produce fuselage frames. Goodrich Corporation is to supply composite engine nacelles and thrust reversers. Korean Air Aerospace Division is to fabricate three of the aircraft’s safety-critical composite doors.

Automating composite production has engaged a number of suppliers including:

MAG Industrial Automation Systems, provider of Viper automated fibre placement machines used at several production sites;

M Torres, supplier of gantry-style automated tape laying, fibre placement and inspection machines;

Flow International, manufacturer of machine tools for composites, including abrasive waterjet units; plus

Aim Engineering and several other jig and tool specialists.

Hexcel Composites expects to make billions of dollars over the life of the programme by providing composite materials, principally its HexPly toughened epoxy product incorporating intermediate modulus carbon fibre. Two years ago Hexcel opened a carbon fibre production plant at Illescas near Toledo, Spain, fibre from which goes to a partner plant in nearby Paria for conversion into prepreg.

Final aircraft assembly will take place in Toulouse where a new A350 XWB assembly unit is being built close to an existing A330/340 production line at a cost of €140 million. The 7.4 hectare assembly area, nearing completion after almost two years of construction, has impressive ‘green’ credentials. There is a high proportion of natural lighting, and with 27 000 m2 of photovoltaic roofing and an advanced energy management system, the site is expected to generate over half of its energy. Use of parallel workflow lines is expected to enable up to ten A350s to be produced per month eventually.

Logistics

As with the Dreamliner, A350 production involves considerable movement of large aerostructures. Fuselage items manufactured in North Carolina will be shipped across the Atlantic to be received at a new Spirit facility in Saint-Nazaire and assembled there into the full 65 ft by 20 ft centre fuselage frame section, which next goes to Hamburg for full fuselage integration. These and other fuselage sections completed at Saint-Nazaire are transported by Beluga – an Airbus A300 modified to carry outsized cargoes in its large whale-like cargo belly - to either Hamburg or Toulouse. Since Saint-Nazaire, Hamburg and Toulouse all have waterside access, items may optionally be shipped by sea.

Spirit AeroSystems will despatch its wing contribution to its operation in Prestwick, Scotland, for integration into the wing leading section before the latter is transported to the final assembly site. The main body of the wing, complete with the trailing edge portion, is flown from the wing assembly site at Broughton, UK, to Toulouse as a final assembly item.

Centre wing boxes are transferred from Nantes to Saint-Nazaire for integration. Other items are transported to European plants from as far afield as the United States, Korea, Malaysia and China.

‘Becoming real’

A key production milestone achieved at Nantes in December 2009 prompted Didier Evrard to declare, “the A350XWB is becoming real!” This happened when work on the centre wing box (CWB) began with the fabrication of a large carbon composite panel. The panel, with its 36 m2 surface area, was formed using a new state-of-the-art tape laying machine and is the largest ‘monobloc’ composite panel ever manufactured at Nantes. Subsequently, tooling for the keel beam was commissioned in Nantes in June. This is a large item that enables the lower shell of the keel beam and the lower panel of the centre fuselage to be laid up in one go. Assembly of the first keep beam is due to start about now.

. In August, work began on one of the largest carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) items on the aircraft – a 31.6 m by 5.6 m upper wing shell.

At Stade, in August, work began on one of the largest carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) items on the aircraft – a 31.6 m by 5.6 m upper wing shell. A massive autoclave facility installed at the plant can accommodate and cure two of these shells simultaneously. Airbus’ use for the first time of automated tape laying to produce this shell is aimed at ensuring speedy production, and consistent high product quality. In September, Airbus in Spain unveiled an even larger piece of wing skin at its Advanced Composites Centre in Illescas. The 32 m by 7 m lower wing cover, a double-curvature item fabricated to precise tolerances, is one of the biggest CFRP components ever built by the aeronautical industry.

Meanwhile in the UK, GKN Aerospace engineers early this year fabricated and evaluated their first composite wing spar, intended for the A350 wing box demonstrator. Preparations are now being finalised at Filton for series production of spars using automated fibre placement and other automated techniques.

At the same time, 11 Airbus and associated sites in Germany, France and Spain have been working together to produce a demonstrator fuselage. Recently the programme completed a second large test fuselage section (the parallel part of the fuselage is produced in three sections). The 18 m long section, with a diameter of more than 6 m, served to develop and validate the compete process chain, from the manufacture of individual panels, frames and clips to shell assembly, section assembly and production of long circumferential joints. Airbus has also had to develop and refine methods for producing fuselage frames, window frames, fasteners and doors, including a hybrid CFRP/titanium door structure being used for the first time.

As well as establishing production processes, demonstrators are used to validate the Electrical Structure Network (ESN), a critical matter with composites since electrical paths for lightning strikes have to be engineered into the structure rather than being freely available as in metals. This is achieved on A350 fuselages by connecting metal frames, aluminium strips attached to composite frames, the metal floor grid etc together in a conductive network. (Boeing is incorporating an electrically conducting metal mesh within its B787 fuselage lay-up.)

Another vital aspect of fuselage evolution is panel development. In September/October, Airbus flight tested an A350 CFRP fuselage panel on an A340 test aircraft, where it was installed in place of a standard metal panel. The 14 m2 panel, produced at Nantes, incorporates microphones so that technicians can assess the panel’s acoustic behaviour when combined with various insulation materials. This is to determine to what extent acoustic energy will be transmitted into the aircraft through a stiff carbon structure, a matter that is still in question. Fuselage sections equipped with fully furnished cabins will be used for assessing the acoustic characteristics of a full composite fuselage. Production of panels is commencing at Premium Aerotec, Aerolia and other aerostructure partners.

Frames, too, are a particular composites focus. Duqueine produced its first frame for Airbus’ demonstrator fuselage in January, using a multiaxial prepreg bending process that it developed in partnership with Airbus over the previous two years. ATK Aerospace Structures recently delivered its first composite stringers, produced using its proprietary automated stiffener forming system, and frames will follow.

Longer wait

Given what is, even for Airbus, a quantum leap further into composites, it is perhaps not surprising that the development programme is slipping behind schedule. So far the airframer has admitted to a delay of about three months, forcing it to compress the originally intended 15-month flight test programme into 12 months in order to meet early delivery commitments. Industry analysts and sources within Airbus suggest that the final delay will be greater than this.

Although manufacture of initial parts is now under way, these are for the demonstrator mock-up and parts for the first production aircraft, MSN001, come next. Start of final assembly of MSN001, the first A350-900, has been pushed back from the second quarter of 2011 to the third quarter, with first flight projected for mid 2012. The ensuing compressed flight test programme will require five aircraft to amass 2600 flight hours before certification can be achieved. The sixth aircraft manufactured will be the first for customer delivery.

Airbus cites four main issues stretching the development timescale: airframe sizing, the electrical structure network, the wing root join, and fuselage damage tolerance. Of these, the first two are considered resolved and progress on the other two is said to be good. Didier Evrard admits that the decision to push back fabrication is due to working in so many areas with carbon fibre. He says that, unlike with metal, it is not possible to commit from a global finite element model and that with composites ‘you only get one chance.‘ He adds that the delays should affect only the -900 variant. The smaller -800 should follow a year after the baseline -900, and the largest -1000 a year after that.

In addition to evidence of slippage in detailed engineering, sources within the supply chain say that shipments of some parts are up to six months late. Analysts may well be justified in suggesting that the first -900 delivery will not take place before 2014. Moreover, early aircraft are likely to be overweight.

Even so, customers do not seem unduly perturbed at present. Given the prospect of an exceptionally light, largely plastic low-maintenance long-range widebody aircraft offering operating costs some 20% lower than current-generation jets, they are prepared to wait a little longer.

Airbus: Bearing Box Failed in Rolls-Royce Engine - CBS News,"Fri, 12 Nov 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWJlYXJpbmctYm94LWZhaWxlZC1pbi1yb2xscy1yb3ljZS1lbmdpbmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An Airbus executive said Friday that Rolls-Royce has identified a faulty bearing box as the cause of the oil leak problem implicated in the midair disintegration of an engine on one of the world's largest airliners, an Australian newspaper reported.

Airbus Chief Operating Officer John Leahy told reporters in Sydney that Rolls-Royce had at some point fixed the bearing box on newer versions of the massive Trent 900 engine, a model designed for the massive A380 superjumbo. He said Rolls was now fixing it on older versions. The Herald Sun reported his comments on its website.

His comments did not address why Rolls-Royce had not fixed the bearing box in older versions of the engine.

Airbus did not elaborate and Rolls-Royce declined to comment on his remarks.

The box in question contains the metal ball bearings that allow movement of the drive shaft that spins the turbines inside jet engines. Investigators have said that leaking oil caused a fire in the engine of a Qantas A380 that heated metal parts and made the motor disintegrate over Indonesia last week, sending shrapnel into the wing and cutting vital safety systems before the jetliner landed safely in Singapore.

They have focused on broken pieces of the engine's heavy turbine disc, a plate that holds the turbine blades that move air through the motor.

EU Air Regulator Eyes Oil Fire in A380 Engines

A380 Engine Tests Ordered by Euro Regulator

Engines on the A380 malfunctioned four times before the disintegration on the flight from Singapore to Sydney. All of the planes landed safely.

The problems dating to 2008 led to two warnings for airlines to check parts of the Trent 900.

Three of the four problems centered on the turbines or oil system.

Rolls-Royce Group PLC said in an update to investors Friday that the disintegration of the Qantas engine resulted from a problem in a specific component in the Trent 900, but it did not provide details.

""The failure was confined to a specific component in the turbine area of the engine. This caused an oil fire, which led to the release of the intermediate pressure turbine disc,"" Rolls-Royce said.

The statement supports a report from the European Aviation Safety Agency, which issued an emergency order Thursday requiring airlines to re-examine their Trent 900s and ground any planes with suspicious leaks.

Leahy said the new models of the Trent 900 had been redesigned to eliminate the problem of excess oil causing turbine fires. He said that Rolls-Royce was retrofitting the older versions with new parts to stop the oil leaks and computer software that would shut down an engine with leaking oil before it was put at risk of disintegration.

""In the future the computer will have software that can identify a problem at the outset and it will shut down an engine before a turbine disc can go out of control and come apart,"" Leahy told the Herald Sun.

Leaks or oil stains have been discovered on six of the total of twenty A380s operated by Qantas, Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines that use the Trent 900, a technologically advanced model designed to be lighter, quieter and more efficient than older engines. Qantas and Singapore Airlines have grounded nine of the world's largest airliner between them while Germany's Lufthansa has already replaced an engine on one of its A380s.

Rolls-Royce's chief executive said the company will be replacing the relevant part to enable its customers to bring the whole fleet back into service.

Airbus will take Rolls-Royce engines off the final assembly line in Toulouse, France, and send them to Qantas ""so we can get Qantas back up and flying,"" the Airbus press office said.

The disintegration on the Qantas A380 was far more serious than the airline has implied in its public statements, however, experts said.

Damage from engine shrapnel to the wing over the engine occurred very close to the wing's front spar, one of two support beams in the wing that attach the wing to the plane, said John Goglia, a former member of the National Transportation Safety Board and an expert on airline maintenance. If the shrapnel had hit the spar it could possibly have weakened the spar and even have caused the wing to fall off, he said.

As it was, the shrapnel appears to have damaged electrical cables and hydraulic lines inside the wing, Goglia said. Pilots were unable to close the landing gear doors, an indication of hydraulic damage, and had difficulty shutting down the engine next to the engine that disintegrated, an indication of an electrical problem, he said. The A380 has four engines.

Photos and video of the incident and its aftermath show the shrapnel clearly ruptured a hydraulic line and an electric line in the wing, cutting off the pilots' control of half the brake flaps and the remaining engine on the affected wing, along with the door of the landing-gear compartment, said Joerg Handwerg, a spokesman for the pilots' union for Lufthansa.

In its trading update Friday, London-based Rolls-Royce said the incident will cause full year profit growth ""to be slightly lower than previously guided,"" but it also said that the company's other operations will help to offset any losses. Back in July, the company said that its underlying profits would grow by 4-5 percent compared to 2009.

Shares in the company rose after the update - a signal that investors are happy to see a definitive statement after days of silence from the world's second-biggest engine maker behind General Electric and one of the last globally important industrial manufacturing companies in Britain.

Rolls-Royce shares were up 4 percent at 607.5 pence ($9.74) in midmorning trade on the London Stock Exchange.

Handwerg said that minor problems are routine for any jet engine, but it is possible that the issues were an indication that regulators did not adequately check the engine before approving it for commercial use.

""When you see we have a problem with not just one of these engines but several then it points towards that we have a problem in the certification process,"" Handwerg said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7466001510620117}",neutral,0.7466001510620117,0
CEO: Design fault may have caused A380 engine failure - CNN,"Fri, 05 Nov 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHA6Ly93d3cuY25uLmNvbS8yMDEwL1dPUkxEL2FzaWFwY2YvMTEvMDUvYXVzdHJhbGlhLnFhbnRhcy5pbmNpZGVudC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sydney, Australia (CNN) -- A design issue rather than poor maintenance is likely to blame for the mid-flight failure of a Qantas airliner's engine, the CEO of the Australian carrier said Friday.

One of the four engines on the Qantas Airbus A380 shut down six minutes after takeoff Thursday from Singapore's Changi Airport, forcing it to return and make an emergency landing.

The plane -- with 440 passengers and 26 crew members -- was headed to Sydney, Australia. But while above the western Indonesian island of Batam, part of the engine's covering, or cowling, tore off.

""This issue does not relate to maintenance; this is an engine issue,"" CEO Alan Joyce told reporters Friday. ""And the engines have been maintained by Rolls-Royce since they've been installed on the aircraft.""

""So we believe that this is probably most likely a material failure or some sort of design issue that we're tracking and trying to understand,"" he added. ""We don't believe this is related to maintenance in any way.""

On Friday, Airbus announced that it had asked all operators of A380s with Rolls-Royce engines to inspect them as a precaution.

Following the Qantas CEO's comments, a Rolls-Royce spokesman referred back to his company's earlier news statement, which said:

""Since Qantas QF32 suffered an engine failure and returned safely to Singapore Changi Airport, we have been working closely with our customer and the authorities. In situations like these, Rolls-Royce has well established processes to collect and understand information relating to the event and to determine suitable actions.""

After the incident, Qantas -- Australia's national airline -- grounded its Airbus A380 fleet.

The airline said flights of the twin-deck planes -- the world's largest airliners -- will remain suspended until an investigation is complete.

On Friday, Joyce said Qantas hopes to resume A380 flights within 48 hours, after completing engine safety checks.

""We believe over the next 24 to 48 hours, those checks will be complete on all of the A380s, and if we don't find any adverse findings out of the checks, the aircraft will resume operations,"" he said.

Qantas has six A380s in its fleet of 191 planes. Airbus will at some point deliver 14 more, the airline said.

Passengers on the detoured Qantas flight spent the night in Singapore, then flew to Australia on Friday.

""Passengers left on a special Qantas flight at 10:30 a.m. local back to Sydney,"" said airline representative Ashley Edwards Knapp.

First major drama involving plane which came into service in 2007



Pierced by a foot-long hole and with debris lying along its wing, this is the Qantas superjumbo moments after making an emergency landing after one of its engines went up in flames.

Passengers on the Qantas Airbus A380 flight from London to Sydney via Singapore described 'a blast' before seeing smoke and door-size debris shooting past the windows 15 minutes after takeoff.

One traveller filmed the emergency from the window, also capturing the pilot's announcement on his phone as the craft turned round to make an emergency landing at Changi Airport, in Singapore.

The superjumbo was carrying 459 passengers and crew. Quantas has now grounded all six of its A380 airliners while safety checks are carried out

'I do apologise. We're having a technical issue with our number two engine,' he said.

'We have dealt with the situation at the moment. The aircraft is secure at this stage. We have to hold for some time as we lighten our load by dumping some fuel and (there's) a number of checks we have to perform.

'And as I'm sure you're aware we're not proceeding to Sydney at this stage. We're making a left turn back to Singapore.



'As we progress with this we'll keep you updated. At this stage everything is secure. The aircraft is flying safely and we'll get back to you with more information. Thank you for your patience.'

All 459 people on the flight, many of whom were British, were unhurt after the incident over western Indonesia.

Descent: A trail of fuel can be seen behind the plane as it comes into land at Singapore's Changi Airport

But Qantas has now grounded its six-strong superjumbo fleet while an investigation is carried out.

Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines powered the Qantas plane and a company spokesman said tonight that a 'number of basic precautionary engine checks' were being made.

He added: 'We will continue to work closely with our customers as the investigation moves forward. This is at a very early stage and it would be inappropriate to draw any conclusions at this time.'



The midair drama unfolded shortly after Flight QF432 had taken off from Singapore on its way to Sydney.

Passenger Lars Sandberg, a DJ from Glasgow, said he was 'just happy to be alive' after the plane landed safely back at Singapore airport.



Destroyed: One of the enginea of the Qantas airline appeared to have exploded. The pilot, who was flying the plane to Sydney, was forced to make an emergency landing in Singapore

Hose it down: Fire engines spray gallons of water over the plane's engines. A second engine failed to switch off, in addition to the one that blew-up mid-air

'When we got off and saw the engine itself and the back casing burnt off, that was pretty scary.



'It was a nerve-wracking experience and I feel a little bit shaken up. I'm just happy to be alive and safe in the terminal building,' he said.

Matt Hewitt from Cheshire, said some people on board had seen bits of a wing 'breaking up' with 'parts sticking up and wires hanging out'.



Six fire engines swarmed around the double-decker aircraft when it landed as a local reporter said he could see smoke still coming from the engine.

The engine closest to the fuselage on the left wing had visible burn marks and was missing a section of plate that would have been painted with the red kangaroo logo of the airline. The upper part of the left wing also appeared to have suffered some damage.

Relief:A large number of families - as well as more elderly passengers - were on the flight



Passenger Rosemary Hegardy, 60, from Sydney, said she heard two bangs and saw flames from her window.

'There were flames - yellow flames came out, and debris came off ... You could see black things shooting through the smoke, like bits of debris,' she said.

German passenger Ulf Waschbusch posted a message on Twitter shortly after landing which read: 'Just emergency landed back in Singapore after engine blew up at take-off and parts ripped through wings. Damn.'

Later, he told Daybreak how he had heard a loud boom noise shortly after take-off and looked out of the window to see what had happened.



'I saw pieces of the engine, number 3 engine, fly off the wing through the wings itself and short bursts of flames for about a second or two at that time,' he said.



'It was one of the scariest things I have ever seen on an aircraft.'

Witnesses on the ground on Batam Island in Indonesia told of hearing a 'very loud explosion'.

People were photographed holding pieces of the engine cover they had found on the ground.



'It sounded like a bomb,' said one witness.

Another witness spoke of hearing a screeching sound before the explosion. 'I thought I heard an explosion and when I looked up I saw a plane going round and round and there was smoke coming out of its tail,' he said.

Qantas CEO Alan Joyce denied there had been an explosion but said he was grounding his entire fleet of A380s

'Then three or four pieces of metal fell from the sky.'



A schoolteacher said some of the small pieces of debris crashed through the roof of a classroom, but no children were hurt.



Police officer Bobby Baharudin said debris was 'scattered over Batam'.



It was not immediately known if ash from the erupting Mount Merapi volcano had caused the engine problem - the volcano, which is spewing thick clouds, lies to the south of the route the jet was taking.



Geoff Reay, an Australian who lives on Batam Island, said his neighbours heard an explosion and ran out into the street.

'There are bits of aircraft lying on the ground and it landed about 200 yards from where our little boy goes to school. Other bits have fallen down in the suburb of Dutamas,' he said.

Indonesian officials are in the process of finding out if anyone has been killed or injured by the falling debris.

At first it was feared the jet had crashed - widespread rumours through Twitter reported that the plane had come down, resulting in Qantas officials issuing immediate denials.

Kompas, a leading Indonesian newspaper, had reported on its website that it was 'suspected that a Qantas plane exploded in the air near Batam.'

Mr Tatang Kurnia, head of Indonesia's Transport Safety Board, said the plane emptied fuel and returned to Singapore to make an emergency landing shortly after it had taken off from the island republic.

Emergency: Passengers emerge from the superjumbo in Singapore. They are now being offered counselling The plane was flying from London to Sydney via Singapore. Debris rained down on the Indonesian island of Batam

Fairfax Media in Australia quoted an anonymous Qantas pilot as saying that engines were routinely shut down on aircraft which fly around the world but 'it must have been quite a catastrophic failure if it blew parts off an engine.'

A Qantas jet suffered a similar incident in August when an engine on a flight to San Francisco exploded, causing debris to tear holes in the engine cover.

Investigators with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau found the engine's turbine blades had either fractured or broken away. The cause of that explosion in the Boeing 747's Rolls Royce RB211 engine is still under investigation.



Qantas denied there had been an explosion today and said the plane landed safely with no injuries.

The distinctive double-decker Airbus costs £156m and came into service in September 2007.Qantas have been using them since 2008.



The flight is a regular service that flies between Sydney, Singapore and London and is usually flown by a superjumbo. Qantas' A380s can carry up to 525 people.

A Qantas statement said the Airbus 380 plane experienced an 'engine issue' soon after taking off from Singapore for Sydney. It made a safe emergency landing in Singapore at 11:45am local time with 433 passengers and 26 crew on board, the statement said.

'Some media reports suggested the aircraft had crashed. These reports are incorrect. No Qantas aircraft has crashed,' it said.

Qantas chief executive officer Alan Joyce said the airline is now suspending all flights of its six Airbus A380 jetliners.

Qantas crew members leave the Changi air terminal in Singapore after making the emergency landing

Mr Joyce told a news conference in Sydney: 'We will suspend those A380 services until we are completely confident that Qantas safety requirements have been met.'

There are currently 37 of the A380 aircraft in operation around the world.

Singapore Airlines has 11 of the superjumbos, Emirates 13, Qantas six, Air France four and German carrier Lufthansa three.

British Airways and Virgin Atlantic are among a number of carriers who have placed orders for A380s. In all, Toulouse-based Airbus has 234 orders from 17 countries for the superjumbo.

Qantas said it was arranging hotel rooms in Singapore for passengers and crew of the affected flight today.

'We are currently planning for an aircraft to depart for Singapore to bring passengers back to Sydney tomorrow morning,' a spokesman added.

Qantas A380s use Rolls-Royce RR.L Trent 900 engines. Shares in Rolls-Royce slumped 1.2 per cent in early-morning trading following the incident.

Emirates and Singapore Airlines said all its A380s would be operating as scheduled.

The Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association said safety was a growing concern for engineers at Qantas as outsourcing of work continued.

'It's about time Qantas listened to the warning signs,' spokesman Steve Purvinas said.

'We know that the dramatic increase in the number of safety incidents involving Qantas jets coincides with an increase in the amount of work that is no longer carried out in-house.'

Mr Purvinas said Qantas had shut down every in-house engine workshop in Australia in the past 10 years, and was naive for believing the current number of maintenance engineers could maintain its growing fleet of A380s.

Airbus A320neo to enter service in 2016 | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Tue, 30 Nov 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWEzMjBuZW8tdG8tZW50ZXItc2VydmljZS1pbi0yMDE2Lzk3MTcxLmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has confirmed the launch of its A320neo, or new engine option, for entry into service in 2016.

Airlines will have a choice between the CFM International LEAP-X and Pratt & Whitney's PurePower PW1100G powerplants. The A320neo will also incorporate ""sharklet"" wing-tips that help to save fuel, says the airframer.

""The A320neo will not only deliver significant fuel savings of up to 15%, which represents up to 3,600t of CO2 savings annually per A320neo. In addition, A320neo customers will benefit from a double-digit reduction in NOx emissions, reduced engine noise, lower operating costs and up to 500nm (950 km) more range or two tonnes more payload,"" adds the EADS subsidiary.

The new engine option is offered on the A321, A320 and A319 models, and will require limited modifications primarily to the wing and pylon areas, says Airbus. The A320neo will have over 95% airframe commonality with the standard A320 family, it adds.

The company sees a market potential of 4,000 A320neo family aircraft over the next 15 years. It has, however, not named any launch customers yet.

""We are confident that the A320neo will be a great success across all markets and with all types of operators, offering them maximum benefit with minimum change. We are leveraging a reliable, mature aircraft and are making it even more efficient and environmentally friendly,"" said Tom Enders, Airbus president and CEO.

Airbus says that it seeks to provide customers with the latest and most eco-efficient technologies to improve aircraft performance and airline operations, while reducing the environmental impact.

""Over the past months, Airbus has taken the time to carefully assess and weigh up the benefits of the A320neo business case with the allocation of the highly skilled engineering resources needed, while at the same time securing the engineering skills required on other Airbus aircraft programmes,"" says the company.

The company is working to ramp up the production rates on its A380 aircraft programme, and is developing the A350 medium-range widebody that is due to enter into service in 2013.

The Pratt & Whitney PW1524G engine is scheduled for an entry into service in 2013 on the Bombardier CSeries CS100, the first of two 110 to 149-seat models offered by the Canadian aircraft maker. These will compete with the A318, A319, Boeing 737--600 and -700.

CFM is set to introduce its Leap-X1C on the 160-seat Commercial Aircraft Corp of China C919, which will see its first revenue service in 2016 as well.

""We are obviously honored to be part of this exciting (A320neo) programme,"" says Eric Bachelet, president and CEO of CFM International. ""This is a natural extension of the long and very successful relationship we have enjoyed with Airbus since the inception of the A320 family program in the early 1980s. CFM pledges its full support to the A320neo's development and certification and to its successful entry into commercial service.""

The Airbus decision comes after a protracted internal debate over the viability of re-engining the company's best selling models. Boeing still has yet to announce its future plans for the 737. Both companies, however, have been boosting production to record levels to satisfy global demand for their short-haul aircraft.

Airbus plans to continue offering A320s with the CFM56-5B or International Aero Engines V2500 powerplants.

A Qantas spokeswoman says Flight QF32 was en route from Singapore to Sydney when one of the A380 jet's four engines shut down.



Aviation industry consultant Gerry Soejatman says the airline industry term for what occurred is an uncontained engine failure.



""That means the engine failed in a manner in which it could not be contained in the engine itself. So there would be parts flying around,"" he said.



Witnesses on the Indonesian island of Batam near Singapore reported hearing an explosion as the plane passed over, and found debris that appeared to be from an aircraft.



Tatang Kurnia, head of Indonesia's Transportation Safety Board, says there are pieces of debris in Batam with red coloring on it and Singapore confirmed that an airplane in the area dumped fuel to make an emergency landing.



The plane returned to Singapore as a precaution. There were initial fears the Airbus 380 had crashed.



No injuries among 459 people on board have been reported, but in Batam two people were reportedly hit by falling debris.



The cause of the engine failure has not been reported. Australian aviation safety officials are on their way to Singapore to check the aircraft and the flight recorder. Soejatman says it is not surprising that the incident occurred during take-off.



""During the take-off phase of the flight, it is the time when the engines are put at most strain, after it shut down from the previous flight,"" he said. ""So that is mechanically the riskiest part of the flight.""



There are 37 Airbus A380 aircraft in use around the world. Qantas has six in operation and 20 more on order. The planes are the largest passenger aircraft and some can carry up to 800 people.



News of this incident comes at a time when airlines around the world are on high alert after discovery of bombs packed in air cargo in Europe.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.5149614810943604}",negative,0.5149614810943604,-1
Qantas grounds Airbus A380s after engine failure - FRANCE 24 English,"Thu, 04 Nov 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi8yMDEwMTEwNC1xYW50YXMtZ3JvdW5kcy1haXJidXMtYTM4MC1lbmdpbmUtZmFpbHVyZS1zeWRuZXktYm91bmQtZmxpZ2h0LXNpbmdhcG9yZS1jaGFuZ2ktYXZpYXRpb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"AVIATION

Australia's Qantas Airways grounded its fleet of six Airbus A380s on Thursday pending an investigation after engine failure six minutes after take-off forced one of its planes en route to Sydney from Singapore to return to Changi Airport.

AP - Qantas grounded its Airbus A380 fleet after one of the superjumbo jets blew out an engine Thursday, shooting flames and raining large metal chunks before making a safe emergency landing in Singapore with 459 people aboard.

It was most serious midair incident involving the double-decker A380, the world’s largest and latest airliner, since it debuted in October 2007 with Singapore Airlines flying it to Sydney - the same route that Qantas flight QF34 was flying when it was stricken.

Qantas said there had been no explosion, but witnesses aboard the plane and on the ground reported blasts. Officials in Indonesia said the engine trouble could not have been related to recent volcanic eruptions of Mount Merapi, some 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) to the east.

After the plane touched down in Singapore, the engine closest to the fuselage on the left wing had visible burn marks and was missing a section of plate that would have been painted with the red kangaroo logo of the airline. The upper part of the left wing also appeared damaged.

One passenger, Rosemary Hegardy, 60, of Sydney, told The Associated Press that she heard two bangs and saw yellow flames from her window.

“There was flames - yellow flames came out, and debris came off. ... You could see black things shooting through the smoke, like bits of debris,” she said.

Although it was nearly 90 minutes from the time of the explosion to the plane landing, there was no panic inside the aircraft, she said.

The captain addressed the passengers immediately by saying “’I’m sure you realize there’s a problem. We have to find out what the problem is,”” she said. Shortly after that, the captain explained that an engine had failed and needed to dump fuel before landing.

“The crew were fantastic, really - I am so amazed that everyone stayed calm,” she said. “We were all sort of really shaken up, but what could you do?”

In another seat, Tyler Wooster watched as part of the skin of the wing peeled off, exposing foam and broken wires.

“My whole body just went to jelly and I didn’t know what was going to happen as we were going down, if we were going to be OK,” Wooster told Australia’s Nine Network news.

Hegardy said the pilot informed passengers of the engine trouble and that the plane would have to dump fuel before it could land.

Residents on the western Indonesian island of Batam, near Singapore, helped authorities pick up more than 100 pieces of debris scattered in 15 locations in Batam. The pieces, mostly small, torn metal but some the size of doors, were brought to police headquarters for the investigation.

The engine trouble happened 15 minutes after takeoff from Singapore at 9:56 a.m. The plane landed after one hour and 50 minutes.

“The shut down of the Qantas engine had no connection with Mount Merapi,” said Bambang Ervan, a spokesman for Indonesia’s Transportation

Ministry. “It was too far from the volcano - the sky over Singapore and Sumatra island is free of dust.”

The flight is a regular service that flies between Sydney, Singapore and London. Qantas’ A380s can carry up to 525 people, but flight QF34 was carrying 433 passengers and 26 crew, all of whom were evacuated by a step ladder in an operation that lasted two hours.

Qantas spokeswoman Emma Kearns in Sydney said there were no injuries or an explosion on board. The airline described the problem as an “engine issue” without elaborating.

“We will suspend those A380 services until we are completely confident that Qantas safety requirements have been met,” Qantas CEO Alan Joyce told a news conference in Sydney.

Joyce appeared to blame the engine, made by Rolls-Royce.

“This issue, an engine failure, has been one that we haven’t seen before.

So we are obviously taking it very seriously, because it is a significant engine failure,” he said.

Singapore Airlines later said in a statement it would be “delaying all flights operating our A380 aircraft” after Rolls-Royce and Airbus advised it to conduct precautionary technical checks.

Experts said the problem appeared to be an “uncontained engine failure,” which occurs when turbine debris punctures the engine casing and the light cowling that covers the unit.

Aviation expert Tom Ballantyne told the AP that Thursday’s troubles were “certainly the most serious incident that the A380 has experienced since it entered operations.”

But “it’s not like the aircraft is going to drop out of the sky,” Ballantyne, Sydney-based chief correspondent at Orient Aviation Magazine, said by telephone from Brunei.

He said the engine shutdown couldn’t have caused a crash. The planes are designed to fly on just two engines, and the pilots are trained to handle engine failures, he said.

Rolls-Royce said it was aware of the situation, noting that the investigation was still at an early stage. Its shares were 4.5 percent lower at 625 pence ($10.16) in midday trade on the London Stock Exchange.

Airbus said in a statement that it was providing all necessary technical assistance to the investigation being conducted by Singaporean authorities.

Martin Fendt, a spokesman for the consortium, declined to comment on Qantas’ grounding of all its A380s, but he said no airworthiness directives have been issued mandating a halt to flights by the superjumbo.

Still, the incident is likely to raise safety questions about one of the most modern aircraft, which has suffered a series of minor incidents.

In September 2009, a Singapore Airlines A380 was forced to turn around in mid-flight and head back to Paris after an engine malfunction. On March 31, a Qantas A380 with 244 people on board burst two tires on landing in Sydney after a flight from Singapore.

Last August, a Lufthansa crew shut down one of the engines as a precaution before landing at Frankfurt on a flight from Japan, after receiving confusing information on a cockpit indicator.

The other issues with the A380s have all been relatively minor, such as electrical problems, Ballantyne said.

Qantas’ safety record is enviable among major airlines, with no fatal crashes since it introduced jet-powered planes in the late 1950s.

But there have been a run of scares in recent years across a range of plane types. The most serious - when a faulty oxygen tank caused an explosion that blew a 5-foot hole in the fuselage of a Boeing 747-400 over the Philippines - prompted aviation officials to order Qantas to upgrade maintenance procedures.

Airbus has delivered a total of 37 A380s so far. Thirteen are in service with Emirates, 11 with Singapore Airlines, six with Qantas, four with Air France and three with Lufthansa.

Emirates airlines, which has 13 A380s in operation, said all of them are flying as scheduled. It noted that its planes are powered by Engine Alliance GP7200 engines.

Thursday’s incident appeared unrelated to mail bombs sent recently on cargo planes, allegedly from Yemeni militants.

The airline described the measure as precautionary. But it casts further doubt on the safety of the world's largest aircraft and their Rolls Royce engines. Both Airbus and Rolls Royce saw their share prices dip after an engine exploded during a Qantas Airlines flight from Singapore last week.



Qantas grounded its entire fleet of A380s after finding oil leaks in three of the engines. The Singapore Airline engines to be replaced also showed evidence of oil leaks, though the airline said they did not have the same problem as the Qantas engines.



Last week's Qantas flight returned safely to Singapore with 459 people on board after one of its four engines exploded, scattering debris on an island in Indonesia. Officials are still investigating the cause of the mishap.

“The new electrical cabling for the first Airbus A380 intended for Singapore Airlines was installed last week,” Gallois had told journalists, saying that the cabin equipment for the plane, which is in the northern German city, would be installed next week.

“We are determined to complete this first delivery in October 2007, as we announced, and to prepare ourselves for the next deliveries in 2008,” he added.

Fabrice Bregier, Airbus managing director, said that the cabling for several aircraft would be completely re-installed and a temporary technical solution had been found to equip the first 25 aircraft.

From the beginning of 2008, the use of new wiring design software such as Catia V and Circe would help with the cabling of aircraft to be delivered from 2009.

Singapore Airlines has committed to buy 19 A380s with other customers including Thai Airways, China Southern Airlines, Australia’s Qantas, Malaysia Airlines, Korean Air and Virgin Atlantic.

Parcel problems

UPS, the Parcel delivery company, said on Friday that it had not decided whether to cancel its order for the superjumbos.

French business daily Les Echos, citing unidentified sources, reported on Friday that UPS would cancel its order for 10 A380s next week.

“We continue to talk to Airbus. We haven’t changed our order and we haven’t made a decision one way or the other, so the order still stands,” said Lynnette McIntire, a spokeswoman for UPS in Atlanta.

Airbus spokeswoman Barbara Kracht said on Friday that she had no information about a possible cancellation.

A cancellation would leave Airbus with no more customers for the cargo version of the A380, after FedEx and International Lease Finance canceled their orders last year.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9928938746452332}",neutral,0.9928938746452332,0
Qantas Fears Engine Design Issue After Airbus Drama - Voice of America - VOA News,"Thu, 04 Nov 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2EvcWFudGFzLWZlYXJzLWVuZ2luZS1kZXNpZ24taXNzdWUtYWZ0ZXItYWlyYnVzLWRyYW1hLTEwNjc1NDcxMy8xMjk4NDUuaHRtbNIBZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9xYW50YXMtZmVhcnMtZW5naW5lLWRlc2lnbi1pc3N1ZS1hZnRlci1haXJidXMtZHJhbWEtMTA2NzU0NzEzLzEyOTg0NS5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Australia's Qantas Airlines said Friday that a faulty part or design issue may have been responsible for a midair engine failure on an Airbus passenger plane.



Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said it is too early to say exactly what caused the engine failure that prompted an emergency landing Thursday. However, he said it was most likely some kind of material failure or a design flaw in the Rolls-Royce engine.



Rolls-Royce has been maintaining the engines on the A380s, the world's largest passenger plane. But Joyce said he does not believe the problem was in any way related to maintenance.



The Australian airline grounded all six of its Airbus A380s after the engine, one of four on the plane, failed shortly after take-off from Singapore on a flight to Sydney.



The A380 returned to Singapore safely 90 minutes later after the pilot dumped fuel to reduce its weight. Qantas said no one was injured among the 459 passengers and crew on board.



Singapore Airlines also grounded all of its Airbus A380s, but later lifted the order saying it had checked and cleared the fleet of 11 planes.



Passengers on the Qantas flight said they heard an explosion, then saw flames shoot out of the damaged engine.



The plane's manufacturer, France-based Airbus, and Rolls-Royce said they would join air safety investigators from Singapore and elsewhere in determining the cause.



Witnesses in a nearby area of western Indonesia reported hearing a loud noise in the sky and seeing an airliner circling overhead. The head of Indonesia's Transportation Safety Board, Tantang Kurnia, said debris from the aircraft was found on the island of Batam. Some fell onto houses and a shopping mall.



There are about 25 jet engine failures each year, either in flight or on the ground. But the U.S. air safety investigative agency, the National Transportation Safety Board, said the failures rarely cause problems because multi-engine jets are designed to be flown with one inoperative engine. Pilots are trained to fly aircraft after an engine failure.



There are 37 Airbus A380s in operation around the world. The jets can carry up to 853 passengers, although most airlines configure the plane's seating to carry about 550. The jumbo jet is more than 24 meters high and 73 meters long. The plane costs $347 million.



Qantas has never had a fatal crash in its 90-year history.

Engineers find oil leaks in engines on three different Qantas Airbus A380s - New York Daily News,"Mon, 08 Nov 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55ZGFpbHluZXdzLmNvbS8yMDEwLzExLzA4L2VuZ2luZWVycy1maW5kLW9pbC1sZWFrcy1pbi1lbmdpbmVzLW9uLXRocmVlLWRpZmZlcmVudC1xYW50YXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzODBzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SYDNEY – Tests have uncovered oil leaks in three Rolls-Royce engines on Qantas‘ grounded Airbus A380s, the airline’s CEO said Monday, as engineers tried to zero in on the cause of an engine failure on board one of the carrier’s superjumbo jets last week.

Australia‘s national carrier grounded its six double-decker A380s, the world’s newest and largest airliner, after an engine burst minutes into a flight from Singapore to Sydney last week, scattering debris over Indonesia‘s Batam island. The plane made a safe emergency landing in Singapore.

Engineers conducted eight hours of extensive checks on each engine over the weekend.

On Monday, CEO Alan Joyce said engineers have discovered oil leaks in the turbine area of three engines on three different A380s.

“The oil leaks were beyond normal tolerances,” Joyce told reporters. “So Rolls-Royce and our engineers have looked at what we have gathered as an accepted level and they have passed that threshold.”

“All of these engines are new engines on a new aircraft type,” he added. “The engines are not performing to the parameters that you would expect with this.”

Because of that, he said, all of the airline’s A380s will be grounded for an additional 72 hours – at least.

All three affected engines have been removed from the planes for further testing, he said.

“As a consequence, it’s now narrowing our focus on that issue,” he said.

Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines, the other airlines that fly A380s fitted with Rolls-Royce’s Trent 900 engines, also briefly grounded their planes last week but resumed services after completing checks.

The Qantas engineers are working with Rolls-Royce, who manufactured and maintains the engines, as well as Airbus.

Investigators have focused their search on a missing piece of turbine from the Rolls-Royce engine.

The Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which is leading an international investigation into the blowout on the A380, appealed for help from residents of Indonesia’s Batam island to find the missing chunk of a turbine disc.

The island was scattered with debris last Thursday when one of the A380’s four Trent 900 engines failed minutes into a flight to Sydney, with 466 people aboard. The engine was quickly shut down and the plane returned to Singapore and safely made an emergency landing.

“The recovery of that disk could be crucial to a full understanding of the nature of the engine failure, and may have implications for the prevention of future similar occurrences,” the bureau said in a statement.

It released a photograph of a jagged and bent piece of turbine disc from the Trent 900 engine and asked that anyone who might have found a similar piece should hand it to police.

It said one piece of the shattered engine that had been found on Batam was being sent to Britain for examination by Rolls-Royce engineers, under the supervision of bureau investigators. Extra experts were being sent from Australia to Singapore to examine other debris.

Rolls-Royce Group PLC, a London-based aerospace, power systems and defense company separate from the car manufacturer, has said the investigation is in its early stages and that it is too early to draw any conclusions.

John Goglia, a former National Transportation Safety Board member and an expert on aircraft maintenance, said the photo showing the broken turbine disc indicates it was the disc that may have failed. The photo didn’t show any signs of discoloration on the disc that would indicate overheating.

There are several reasons why a disc might fail, but they usually involve the metal used to make the disc or the manufacturing method, Goglia said. He cautioned that he was looking at one photo, which was not enough information to make a definitive judgment.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6160775423049927}",neutral,0.6160775423049927,0
Rolls-Royce shares recover after 'progress' on engine failure - CNN International,"Mon, 08 Nov 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHA6Ly9lZGl0aW9uLmNubi5jb20vMjAxMC9CVVNJTkVTUy8xMS8wOC9yb2xsc3JveWNlLmVuZ2luZXMvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"London, England (CNN) -- Shares in Rolls-Royce rose Monday after the company announced that it had made progress in understanding the cause of a Qantas mid-air engine blow-out.

The shares rose by 2.62 percent -- they had been 14 percent down from Thursday after the Australian carrier revealed early Monday that oil leaks had been discovered in the engines on three of its planes after being examined by Rolls-Royce engineers.

This follows last week's aborted flight by an A380, which was forced to make an emergency landing in Singapore shortly after take off when one of its engines failed.

Rolls-Royce on Monday issued a statement saying the Qantas problem was caused by an ""incident specific to the Trent 900 engine.""

""As a result, a series of checks and inspections has been agreed with Airbus, with operators of the Trent 900 powered A380 and with the airworthiness authorities,"" the Rolls-Royce statement continued.

Qantas CEO Alan Joyce told reporters the leaks were ""beyond normal tolerances"" and that the planes will not return to service until the airline is ""100 percent sure"" about their safety,

""It is disturbing that Qantas found three more engines that needed to be looked at. That's a total of four,"" aviation consultant Peter Goelz told CNN. ""This is a relatively... young aircraft. These engines have probably less than 200,000 total hours, so it is an issue that we need to be concerned about.""

New safety fears ground Qantas A380s

Singapore airlines and Lufthansa also operate the A380 equipped with Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines, but they reported no problems after carrying out their own extensive checks. Their fleets are now flying again.

Dubai-based Emirates also operate the double-decked Airbus A380 but with GP7000 engines, designed as part of a joint venture between U.S. manufacturers General Electric and Pratt and Whitney. These engines have not been part of the current safety scare.

Before the share price recovery, more than $1.6 billion had been wiped off the value of British-based Rolls-Royce, its share value dropping by 14 percent since Thursday. Shares in EADS, which owns Airbus, were down by half a percent for the same period.

""We're looking at a period of time when investors will be pretty jittery,"" said Dan Thisdell of Flightglobal.com.

""But they've got to grapple with this problem in a way that maintains confidence among their prospective customers as well as existing customers.

""If it is some kind of underlying design flaw, though this would seem unlikely given the enormous expertise and modern computer simulation technology available to Rolls-Royce, then there could be a problem given the level of investment involved.""

In August, another Rolls-Royce engine -- this time a Trent 1000 -- suffered an uncontained failure during testing in England. This particular model is designed to power Boeing's latest commercial aircraft, the 787 Dreamliner.

Rolls-Royce said on Tuesday that the Trent 1000 issue was not connected to the Qantas Trent 900 incident.

Rolls-Royce said in the statement: ""This incident happened during a development program with an engine operating outside normal parameters. We understand the cause and a solution has been implemented.""

With at least half of the 850 787s on order destined to be powered by Trent engines, Thisdell told CNN that this will be another profitable source of income for a very long time.

""Many airlines have placed orders for aircraft years down the line and have not yet selected their preferred engine,"" he said.

""But no-one has a better reputation than Rolls-Royce. Many airlines will order Rolls-Royce engines as a matter of course because they've had first rate service from them for years.

""Not every airline see it this way, but many -- particularly small and medium-sized airlines -- feel some comfort in having a single supplier of engines for all the aircraft they fly because it provides some commonality with maintenance, spares and training for mechanics.""

As if to reinforce this point, Rolls-Royce on Monday announced a new $350 million engine servicing contract with Egyptair, who operate a fleet of Airbus A330s fitted with Trent 700 engines.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6546789407730103}",neutral,0.6546789407730103,0

The Airbus A380 superjumbo explosion on November 4 grounded the world’s largest passenger aircraft [AFP]

Australia’s Qantas Airways has resumed limited Airbus A380 superjumbo flights, three weeks after a mid-air engine blast grounded the fleet for intensive safety checks.

Alan Joyce, the chief executive of Qantas, joined the first leg of flight QF31 to London via Singapore, which left Sydney at 5:30 pm [0630 GMT] on Saturday with a full load of 453 passengers.

“It’s great that we can reintroduce the aircraft,” Joyce said.

“We are 100 per cent comfortable with the operation of the aircraft.”

Only two of Qantas’s A380s will initially return to service, with the airline taking delivery of two new superjumbos before the year’s end and another two in early 2011.

The planes remain barred from trans-Pacific flights to Los Angeles because of the extra engine thrust required.

Engine problems

Qantas suspended its six A380s, which fly long-haul routes to London and Los Angeles, after a superjumbo’s engine blew-up on November 4, forcing an emergency landing in Singapore.

Checks revealed problems with 16 of the total 24 Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines powering Qantas’s A380s – four per plane – meaning the turbines would have to be replaced or modified.

“The decision to restore A380 services follows an intensive Trent 900 engine inspection programme carried out in close consultation with Rolls-Royce and Airbus,” Qantas said in a statement this week.

“Together with the engine and aircraft manufacturers and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, Qantas is now satisfied that it can begin reintroducing A380s to its international network progressively.”

Qantas, which has never suffered a fatal crash in the jet age, had visiting English football star David Beckham pose on an A380 for the media this week, while Airbus ran full-page newspaper ads for the plane on Saturday.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9957371950149536}",neutral,0.9957371950149536,0
Oil fire suspected in A380 failure | Arkansas Democrat Gazette - Arkansas Online,"Fri, 12 Nov 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMTAvbm92LzEyL29pbC1maXJlLXN1c3BlY3RlZC1hMzgwLWZhaWx1cmUtMjAxMDExMTIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"— Europe’s air safety regulator said Thursday that an oil fire may have caused an engine turbine failure on a Qantas superjumbo jet, and issued an emergency order requiring airlines to reexamine that type of Rolls-Royce engine and ground any planes with suspicious leaks.

The order by the European Aviation Safety Authority backed earlier indications from investigators that they suspect a turbine disc was the cause of last week’s engine failure on the Airbus A380, but was the first official mention of an oil fire preceding the engine’s disintegration.

The A380 engine failure shortly after takeoff from Singapore on Nov. 4 has raised concerns over the safety of the world’s biggest passenger airplane three years after its debut. The failure sent shrapnel slicing through the plane’s wing. Pilots made a safe emergency landing with 466 passengers and crew aboard.

Qantas said this week that it had found small oil leaks on Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines on three of its other Airbus A380s during tests after the Nov. 4 accident. The airline, Australia’s national carrier, said Thursday that it was keeping its six A380s grounded until further checks were completed - extending an earlier deadline.

Singapore Airlines on Wednesday grounded three of its 11 A380s after checks prompted by the Qantas accident revealed what the company called oil stains in the Trent 900 engines. Lufthansa also uses the A380-Trent 900 combination, but said Wednesday that its checks had not turned up anything untoward.

The European regulator said in a new “emergency airworthiness directive” posted on its website Thursday that airlines using Trent 900 engines should conduct “repetitive inspections” of them.

Twenty planes operated by Qantas, Germany’s Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines use the Trent 900 engines. Nine have been grounded: six Qantas jets and three Singapore Airlines jets.

The European Aviation Safety Authority said airlines should check several parts of the engines, including the oil service tubes, to ensure there is no “abnormal” leakage. If any such leaks are found, the airlines are prohibited from using the engines.

The directive was issued in response to the Qantas engine failure. The safety agency said an analysis of the investigation so far “shows that an oil fire” in part of the engine “may have caused the failure” of the engine’s intermediate pressure turbine disc.

“This condition, if not detected, could ultimately result in uncontained engine failure potentially leading to damage to the airplane and hazards to persons or property on the ground,” the directive said.

The Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which is taking the lead in the investigation, has focused on a mangled section of a shattered turbine disc that was recovered from the stricken plane. It has been sent to Britain for testing, with investigators coordinating with Rolls-Royce, the bureau said.

The Qantas and Singapore accidents are not the first problems Rolls-Royce has faced with its engines. In September 2009, a Singapore Airlines A380 was forced to return to Paris midflight after an engine malfunction. Last August, a Lufthansa crew shut down one of its engines as a precaution before landing in Frankfurt after receiving confusing information on a cockpit indicator.

Qantas airlines has announced that it will keep its Airbus A380 super-jumbos grounded for at least three more days after finding oil leaks in some engines. This follows a serious incident last week when an engine broke apart in mid flight, forcing the plane to make an emergency landing in Singapore.

Qantas Chief executive Alan Joyce said rigorous testing had uncovered the anomalies on the Rolls-Royce engines on three separate aircraft, pushing back the return to action of the long-haul planes by 72 hours.

""The oil leaks were beyond normal tolerances,"" Joyce told journalists in Sydney on Monday. ""All of these engines are new engines. At this stage, Qantas does not expect to operate the A380 fleet for at least another 72 hours.""

Qantas has not had a fatal jet crash in 90 years, but has suffered from two incidents in just a week.

In the second one, a Qantas Boeing 747 also had to turn back to Singapore after another model of Rolls-Royce engine also failed in mid-air.

The A380 is the world's biggest commercial jet, servicing lucrative routes from Los Angeles and London to Australia's major cities of Sydney and Melbourne.

"Qantas A380: Rolls-Royce Eats Crow, May Replace Dozens of Engines - CBS News","Tue, 16 Nov 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvcWFudGFzLWEzODAtcm9sbHMtcm95Y2UtZWF0cy1jcm93LW1heS1yZXBsYWNlLWRvemVucy1vZi1lbmdpbmVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus A380s around the world continue to sit on the ground as the hunt for what caused an engine to fail earlier this month winds up. It now appears that dozens of engines may have to be replaced completely and that could take a long time. What's even more amazing about this is that Rolls-Royce, the manufacturer of the Trent 900 engine in question, seems to believe the problem is a known issue that had already been fixed on newer engines. Rolls-Royce is looking terrible right now.

According to Airbus, the oil leak that caused the uncontained failure is related to a bearing box that's standard on newer engines. See, Rolls-Royce apparently knew about the problem but didn't think it was a big enough issue to bother fixing the old ones right away. Because of this, it's possible that 20 engines on Singapore Air A380s and 14 on Qantas A380s will need to be replaced. Lufthansa, the only other airline operating the A380 with Rolls-Royce engines, is unaffected.

If the engines do in fact need to be replaced, that's going to create a nightmare for Rolls-Royce, Airbus, and the airlines. This is not a high volume production aircraft, and the Trent 900 engines are only on the A380. So there aren't a large number of engines just lying around. It's being reported that Airbus will start taking engines off of planes in production and that could impact future deliveries. As you can imagine, this isn't good news for the A380 program, which is already fairly sparse on orders, with 234 in hand at last check.

But it's an even bigger program for Rolls-Royce. With deliveries potentially taking a big delay, might current operators turn to the other engine offered on the A380 to speed things up? Or will operators be so concerned about the Rolls-Royce engine product that they walk away regardless of timing issues? It's a very real concern.

At the very least, even if Rolls doesn't lose orders, it will have to pay millions of dollars for new engines. It's also inevitable that Qantas will look to Rolls for compensation for the weeks that these planes sat idle. The tab is going to be sky high.

It's certainly going to burn some bridges in the relationship between Rolls and Airbus. As the airplanes continue to sit on the ground waiting for new engines, the news seems likely to only get worse.

A team of 10 experienced sports parachutists, including Enders and Bruno Delannoy, A400M programme manager for Europe's OCCAR procurement agency, took part in the test. They jumped from the aircraft's rear cargo ramp from an altitude of 12,000ft (3,660m) above the La Juliana drop zone near Seville, Spain. The skydivers involved had previously made a combined 35,000-plus descents, Airbus says.

Using MSN3, Airbus Military performed the first paradrop tests with an A400M near Toulouse, France on 4 November.

EADS expects a new development and production contract for the military transport to come into effect late this year, after receiving the required parliamentary approvals from European partner nations Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain, Turkey and the UK. They will receive 170 A400Ms from early 2013 under the programme, with export customer Malaysia also to acquire four.

Airbus Military's current three development aircraft had been flown more than 230 times by early November and logged a combined 765 flight hours, the company says. MSN4 will join the flight test programme before the end of this year, with a fifth and final example to follow during 2011.

Airbus set to launch A320 NEO | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Tue, 30 Nov 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLXNldC10by1sYXVuY2gtYTMyMC1uZW8vOTcxNjkuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus will launch a re-engined version of its A320 family aircraft Wednesday, for entry into service in 2016, say industry sources.

The A320 new engine option, or NEO, will be launched with variants of Pratt & Whitney's PW1000G and CFM Leap-X engines.

The 150-seat A320, the original member of the European airframer's narrowbody family first introduced in 1988, will be the first model offered with the new engine option.

Airbus expects to achieve up to 15% improvement in fuel burn with the new engines, which includes a 3.5% boost with new Sharklets, which enter service in 2012 with Air New Zealand.

The Pratt & Whitney PW1524G engine is scheudled for an entry into service in 2013 on the Bombardier CSeries CS100, the first of two 110 to 149-seat models offered by the Canadian aircraft maker, that are intended to compete with the Airbus A318, A319, Boeing 737-600 and -700.

CFM is currently set to introduce its Leap-X1C under the wing of the 160-seat Chinese Comac C919, which will see its first revenue service in 2016.

The Airbus decision comes after a protracted 'will they, won't they' debate over hanging new engines on the company's best selling models. Boeing still has yet to announce its future plans on its 737, though the decision by Airbus comes as both airframers are boosting production to record levels to satisfy global demand for short-haul aircraft.

Airbus has maintained that it will continue to offer its A320 powered by CFM56-5B and IAE V2500 engines along side those with the new engine option.

3 Airlines Halt A380 Flights Over Engine Explosion - BlueRidgeNow.com,"Fri, 05 Nov 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsdWVyaWRnZW5vdy5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDEwLzExLzA1LzMtYWlybGluZXMtaGFsdC1hMzgwLWZsaWdodHMvMjgyNTY1NjYwMDcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"3 Airlines Halt A380 Flights Over Engine Explosion

HONG KONG — Three airlines suspended flights of Airbus A380 superjumbo jetliners on Thursday after an engine on a Qantas plane blew apart shortly after takeoff from Singapore.

Debris fell on an Indonesian island, and the plane, with more than 450 people aboard, spent 90 tense minutes circling with its three remaining engines, dumping fuel and preparing for an emergency landing back in Singapore. The episode ended with passengers cheering and praising the flight crew for maintaining calm. There were no reported injuries.

Justin Dubon, an Airbus spokesman in France, said it was the first uncontained engine failure and the most serious problem experienced by the A380, which entered service in 2007. Such a failure is extremely rare and occurs when components fly off the main engine housing, often with explosive force.

Qantas — Australia’s largest carrier — Singapore Airlines and Lufthansa each canceled flights. Qantas, with six of the A380s, and Singapore, with 11, grounded their fleets. Lufthansa, which has three A380s, called off a late-night flight from Frankfurt. On Friday morning, Singapore Airlines resumed flying its A380s.

The European Aviation Safety Agency, which regulates Airbus and the engine’s maker, Rolls-Royce, said it was working closely with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau to determine the cause. “We take this issue very seriously,” said Jeremie Teahan, an agency spokesman in Cologne, Germany.

The A380 can seat up to 800 passengers. Currently, 37 are being flown by five airlines. The 20 operated by Qantas, Singapore and Lufthansa all use the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine. Seventeen others operated by Air France and Emirates use a different engine.

The 37 planes have completed roughly 21,400 flights, said Mr. Dubon, the Airbus spokesman. Previous mechanical problems with the A380 have been relatively minor, involving fuel and braking systems, Mr. Dubon said.

Flight 32 was minutes into its route to Sydney when the engine blew out.

One passenger said he heard a noise “like a bang, like a shotgun going off, like a big, loud gun.”

“My whole body just went to jelly,” the passenger, Tyler Wooster, told Australia’s Nine Network, “and I didn’t know what was going to happen as we were going down, if we were going to be O.K.”

Passengers said the flight crew made frequent and reassuring announcements. Some took cellphone video of smoke pouring from under the left wing.

The flight was set upon by emergency crews after it returned to Changi International Airport in Singapore about 11:45 a.m. Local news media broadcast images of the charred No. 2 engine — the inside engine on the left wing — being doused by fire engines. Television images from the island of Batam in Indonesia showed people holding large chunks of metal, some bearing the red and white paint of the Qantas insignia.

Photographs taken by several passengers from inside the plane and posted on the Internet showed at least two large punctures on the upper side of the wing, with bits of metal skin protruding.

“It looks like there are a couple of pretty good sized holes with the metal blown out,” said William R. Voss, president of the Flight Safety Foundation, based in Alexandria, Va. “That almost certainly means that debris came up through the bottom of the wing.”

Alan Joyce, Qantas’s chief executive, said the airline would suspend the A380s “until we are confident that Qantas safety requirements have been met,” according to a statement on the airline’s Web site. But he said that the episode would not affect Qantas’s current order for 14 more A380s.

In a statement, Rolls-Royce, based in London, said the company felt it was “prudent to recommend that a number of basic precautionary engine checks are performed,” given that the Trent 900 engine had been in service for only three years. It added that “it would be inappropriate to draw any conclusions” so early in the investigation.

Nicholas Ionides, a Singapore Airlines spokesman, said that based on the Rolls-Royce advice, the airline was temporarily suspending flights by its A380s.

A Lufthansa spokesman, Aage Dünhaupt, said that an A380 that flew from Frankfurt on Thursday afternoon for Tokyo would undergo an inspection of its engines after landing on Friday. Josh Rosenstock, a Rolls-Royce spokesman, declined to give further details about the types of inspection it was recommending. (Rolls-Royce is a separate company from the carmaker, a subsidiary of BMW.)

The episode represents a fresh setback for Rolls-Royce after a different engine model, designed to power Boeing’s long-awaited 787 Dreamliner, had an uncontained failure that caused minor damage to a testing center in August. The failure of that engine, a Trent 1000, led Boeing to postpone deliveries for the 787 — already two years behind schedule — until early next year.

Qantas, an airline with a reputation for safety, has experienced several problems this year. In late March, a Qantas Boeing 747 bound for Singapore returned to Sydney after a pilot reported mechanical problems that affected one of the plane’s engines, according to Australian news media. On March 31, the airline reported that a brake had locked up as an A380 landed in Sydney, causing two tires to blow out.

On Aug. 31, the airline reported a “catastrophic failure” in an engine of a 747 flying from San Francisco to Sydney, according to the newspaper The Australian. The jetliner returned safely to San Francisco.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9092279672622681}",neutral,0.9092279672622681,0

Australian airline Qantas said Monday that it would keep its Airbus A380 fleet grounded for at least another 72 hours after investigators found oil leaks in some engines.

AFP - Qantas kept its Airbus A380 superjumbos grounded for at least three more days on Monday after finding oil leaks in some engines, reviving safety fears after two mid-air blow-outs last week.



Chief executive Alan Joyce said rigorous testing had uncovered the anomalies on the Rolls-Royce engines on three separate aircraft, pushing back the return to action of the long-haul planes by 72 hours.



""The oil leaks were beyond normal tolerances,"" Joyce told journalists in Sydney. ""All of these engines are new engines.""



""At this stage, Qantas does not expect to operate the A380 fleet for at least another 72 hours.""



Qantas's impeccable safety record -- the Australian flag-carrier has never had a fatal jet crash in 90 years -- has come into question after two engine explosions in as many days last week.



On Thursday, a Qantas Airbus A380 was forced to return to Singapore for an emergency landing after one of its four Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines exploded just minutes into its flight, showering an Indonesian town with debris.



And on Friday, a Qantas Boeing 747 -- which was carrying the A380's captain -- also had to turn back to Singapore after another model of Rolls-Royce engine also failed in mid-air.



Both flights, which were carrying a combined total of 897 passengers and crew, arrived safely back in Singapore but some of those onboard have spoken of their fear at hearing blasts as the engines failed.



""I just looked at my wife and held hands and I really thought I was going to die,"" New Zealander Hamzah Munif said of his experience on the Boeing 747-400 after returning to Sydney on Sunday.



But Swedish passenger Peter Geisler said he was not frightened by the malfunction which he described as ""no big deal"" given the aircraft was able to operate on its three other engines.



""I didn't hear any riots or people crying or anything,"" he told reporters.



Qantas's six A380s, the world's biggest commercial jet, service lucrative routes from Los Angeles and London to Australia's major cities of Sydney and Melbourne.



The grounding has forced the carrier -- which has refused to speculate on the cost of the operation -- to add extra services on some routes and use other aircraft to allow thousands of passengers to make their journeys.



Joyce said Qantas's A380s would not take to the skies until the airline was ""100 percent sure that we can assure the safety of our operations"".



""We are not going to take any risks whatsoever,"" he told reporters.



Qantas said last week an engine design flaw on the double-decker planes may be at fault, and Joyce said the oil leaks would help narrow investigations into the blast, which also caused damage to the wing and one other engine.



It was possible ""this is a problem with the engine not meeting its design criteria"", he said.



Joyce said Qantas, the only airline which has still grounded its A380s, took safety ""unbelievably seriously"" but he still expected the massive aircraft to be flying again within days.



""We still believe with the progress we are making -- this is days not weeks -- but we will take as long as it needs to in order that we are absolutely comfortable the aircraft is safe to fly,"" he told ABC Radio.



Qantas has angrily denied union claims that the problems may be linked to the outsourcing of maintenance work to companies abroad.



The incidents have overshadowed Qantas's anniversary celebrations which started on Saturday, with visiting ""ambassador-at-large"" and trained pilot John Travolta forced to defend the airline's safety record.



The Hollywood star said Qantas' pilot training was arduous ""and that's why you guys are so safe.""



Shares in the ""Flying Kangaroo"" shed 2.1 percent to 2.80 Australian dollars.

The crash of the Cuban airliner ATR-72 yesterday killed 86 people and came just after the Qantas flight from Singapore to Sydney was forced to turn back after one of it's engines blew up.

Airliner safety is recorded by organisations that detail the data for all airliners worldwide.

Consultancy, Ascend Worldwide, have provided a data set looking at the most popular airliners in the world. The data shows how many fatal accidents have occurred and how many passenger fatalities there have been. It does not include terror attacks.

The data shows some key results:

• The MD 80 has the highest number of passenger fatalities although the Boeing 737 (CFMI) follows closely with 1049 fatalities.

• The Boeing 777, Airbus A319 and ERJ- 145 have all recorded no fatal accidents to passengers or passenger fatalities.

• Boeing 737 (NG) currently holds the highest number of operating airliners at 3274 worldwide.

""Six freefall paratroopers made jumps from aircraft ""Grizzly Three"" in separate passes from 6,000ft [1,820m] at the Fonsorbes drop zone near Toulouse on 4 November,"" Airbus says.

The personnel were drawn from the UK and French armed forces, and from the latter's CEV flight test centre. Two jumped from the A400M's rear cargo ramp, and four from the aircraft's left-hand paratroop door.

Airbus says initial feedback received from the paratroops is that the A400M is ""easier to jump from than other transports"". The company cites the type's ability to fly at just 110kt (203km/h) during the drop procedure as a contributory factor.

Visible in the released image, the A400M's new side door deflectors were added to the development aircraft fleet after initial tests with the ramp and side doors open resulted in high noise levels and turbulence inside the cargo hold, says Fernando Alonso, Airbus Military's senior vice-president flight and integration test centre.

Conducted after initial tests using water-filled balloons and also followed by the release of instrumented dummies from static lines, the first paratroop jumps will lead to further trials scheduled to take place during 2011, Airbus says.

Each A400M will be able to carry up to 116 fully equipped paratroops once the delayed type enters operational service around 2013.

After reaching a new agreement in Toulouse last week, Airbus expects to sign a new production contract before year-end with its European launch customers Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain, Turkey and the UK. The nations are now expected to take delivery of 170 production aircraft; 10 fewer than previously contracted for. Malaysia will also receive four examples under the company's lone export deal for the type.

Qantas and Singapore Airlines have grounded their fleets of A380 aircraft after “significant engine failure” caused an Airbus superjumbo operated by Qantas to make an emergency landing in Singapore on Thursday.

Advertising Read more

REUTERS - Qantas Airways and Singapore Airlines suspended flights of Airbus A380 superjumbos on Thursday after engine failure forced an emergency landing in Singapore.

One passenger reported hearing a ""massive bang"" before the aircraft turned back and Indonesian TV showed pictures of debris on the ground near Batam airport which it said belonged to the Qantas plane.

Authorities said none of the 459 people on board the Qantas flight was hurt in the most serious incident for the world's largest passenger plane in three years of commercial flight.

""THERE WAS A BANG, AND THEN ANOTHER BANG"" ""This was a significant engine failure,"" Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce told reporters in Sydney. ""We are not underestimating the significance of this issue.""

Qantas A380s use Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines. Rolls-Royce, whose shares were down more than 5 percent, said it was working with authorities to understand the incident.

Planemaker Airbus said it will provide full technical assistance to Australian and French accident investigators.

One of the Airbus A380's four Rolls-Royce engines failed minutes after it had left Singapore for Sydney. Qantas CEO Joyce said the plane was capable of flying on two engines.

Passengers said they saw parts of the engine fall off.

""I just heard this massive bang, like a shotgun going off,"" Tyler Wooster told Australia's Network Nine television. ""Part of the skin had peeled off and you could see the foam underneath, pieces of broken wires sticking out."" The flight had begun in London.

Qantas, which operates six A380s, said it was grounding the aircraft pending a full investigation. Three A380 flights scheduled for Thursday, one originating in Sydney and two in Los Angeles, have been scrapped.

""We will suspend all A380 takeoffs until we are fully confident we have sufficient information about (flight) QF32,"" Joyce told reporters.

Singapore Airlines said it will delay all flights on its A380 fleet pending precautionary checks recommended by Airbus and Rolls-Royce. It was not immediately clear how many flights would be affected or for how long.

Investigation

The Australian Transport Safety Bureau was leading the investigation into the incident, Joyce said. Passengers will stay in Singapore overnight and another plane will be dispatched for them on Friday morning.

Initial media reports said the plane had crashed after an explosion over the Indonesian island of Batam, near Singapore.

There have been no fatal incidents involving A380s since they were launched in 2005 as the greenest, quietest -- as well as the biggest -- jetliner. Shares in Airbus parent company EADS were down more than 4 percent by 1245 GMT. Qantas shares were little changed.

Emirates said it was not considering suspending flights as its engines are from a different supplier. European airlines Air France and Lufthansa said they would continue to use the aircraft as normal.

The plane involved in the incident was built in 2008.

More than 200 orders have been placed for the A380, and 37 are in operation worldwide, according to Airbus. The plane cost $17 billion to develop and has been dogged by production delays.

Qantas has never had a fatal accident. A mid-air explosion blew a minivan-size hole in the side of a Qantas 747-400 in 2008 which Australian air safety investigators blamed on an oxygen bottle.

One of the planes operated by Qantas burst two tyres this year when landing in Sydney, and in September 2009 an A380 was forced to turn around in mid-flight and return to Paris.

""This is probably the most serious incident involving the A380 since it began flying in commercial service,"" said aviation expert Tom Ballantyne, chief correspondent of Orient Aviation magazine. ""There have been minor engine incidents before but nothing like this.""

Singapore's Channel NewsAsia said the plane circled Singapore to burn fuel before making an emergency landing.

Former aircraft engineer Neil Shephard was on board.

""Four or five minutes after the flight (took off) there was a loud bang,"" he told Reuters. ""The pilot said there was a technical issue with the plane and then we circled around for an hour to dump the fuel. During the landing, it was a bit wobbly.""

Passengers were kept informed at all times, others who were on board said.

""It appears from the images of the plane that one of the engines has experienced a failure and it looks to be a fairly massive internal failure at that,"" said Peter Marosszeky at the University of New South Wales' aviation department.

""This failure has caused some of the engine ducting known as bypass ducting to depart from the engine. This type of incident has been seen previously but it was a long time ago and with much older planes than the A380.""

A Reuters reporter said the plane was surrounded on the ground by emergency vehicles but there was no sign of any smoke or fire. One of the four nacelles -- structures that house the engines -- was missing and there appeared to be charring around that area of the plane.

Rusdi, a witness in Batam, told Indonesia's Metro TV: ""After an explosion, the plane was still moving but smoke was trailing from one of its wings.""

Indonesian volcano Mount Merapi has erupted several times in the past week, spewing ash into the sky, but is several hundred miles from the A380's flightpath.

Thursday's incident came just days before Qantas was due to celebrate its 90th anniversary with a special open day in Brisbane.

Qantas A380 landing: Airlines were warned in August over engine safety - The Guardian,"Thu, 04 Nov 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDEwL25vdi8wNC9haXJidXMtYTM4MC1xYW50YXMtc2luZ2Fwb3JlLWVuZ2luZdIBVGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDEwL25vdi8wNC9haXJidXMtYTM4MC1xYW50YXMtc2luZ2Fwb3JlLWVuZ2luZQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Two airlines grounded their fleets of Airbus A380 superjumbos today following an emergency landing by a Qantas plane after one of its engines blew apart in mid-air, damaging a wing and showering debris on the ground below.

It emerged tonight that in August Europe's air safety watchdog issued an alert about abnormal wear inside the British-made Rolls Royce engines used on the huge, double-decker planes, though experts said it was too early to tell if the two were connected.

Flight QF32 from London to Sydney had just taken off from a stopover in Singapore when the plane suffered what the Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, described as a ""significant engine failure"".

Passengers described a loud bang and a flash of flame. They then saw part of the casing of engine apparently stripped away, and a small hole in the wing. Dozens of pieces of debris, believed to be from the engine, were found on the Indonesian island of Batam. ""There were flames, yellow flames came out, and debris came off. You could see black things shooting through the smoke, like bits of debris,"" said passenger Rosemary Hegardy.

While the plane, carrying 433 passengers and 26 crew, was able to circle to dump fuel before landing safely at Singapore's Changi airport shortly before midday local time, Qantas – famous, thanks to the film Rain Man, for its enviable safety record – announced it was grounding its A380s. Experts from the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch flew to Singapore yesterday to help the inquiry.

""We do take our safety reputation unbelievably seriously and we're not going to take risks with passenger safety,"" Joyce said. ""As a precaution, we're suspending flights of the A380."" Early this morning Singapore Airlines said its A380 services would continue as technical checks had been completed. Lufthansa was conducting checks without interrupting flights. Two other airlines that fly the A380 use other engines.

The incident – the most serious safety scare involving the world's biggest airliner in its three years of service – is a particular worry for Rolls Royce, which makes the Trent 900 engines fitted to most A380s at its Derby factory. The company, which lost more than 5% of its share price today, said it was working with airlines to see what went wrong. It refused to discuss the directive issued by the European Aviation Safety Agency in August which warned that scrutiny of stripped Trent 900s had found that unusual wear on splines used to secure the turbines could lead to engine failure coupled with ""oil migration and oil fire"".","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9916514754295349}",negative,0.9916514754295349,-1
Airbus engine failure warning weeks before Qantas scare - Channel 4 News,"Thu, 04 Nov 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoYW5uZWw0LmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1lbmdpbmUtZmFpbHVyZS13YXJuaW5nLXdlZWtzLWJlZm9yZS1xYW50YXMtc2NhcmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Exclusive: Channel 4 News reveals the Rolls-Royce engines used on the Airbus A380 were identified as “potentially unsafe” weeks before a Qantas jet was forced to make an emergency landing.

The double-decker Qantas plane made an emergency landing in Singapore after one of its engines shut-down in mid-air.

All 459 people on the “Superjumbo” plane, which was flying to Australia, were uninjured, and a Qantas statement said they were now investigating what caused the problems with the aircraft.

We are obviously taking this very seriously, because it was a significant engine failure. Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce

It has grounded its remaining Airbus A380 fleet while it works with Airbus and the engine manufacturer, Rolls-Royce, to find out the cause of the incident.

Singapore Airlines has also delayed all Airbus A380 flights.

Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce said: “We will suspend all A380 take offs until we are fully confident we have sufficient information about [flight] QF32… The A380 is a fantastic aircraft. This issue of an engine failure is one we have not seen before.

“We are obviously taking this very seriously, because it was a significant engine failure.”

While everyone, quite rightly, is warning against speculation over the cause of the engine failure that caused the Qantas A380 Airbus to make an emergency landing at Singapore, Channel 4 News can reveal only a month ago airlines were warned of a turbine problem with the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines used on the A380 planes now in service with Qantas, Singapore Airlines and Lufthansa, and which will power British Airways’ planes when they are delivered.

In August, the European Aviation Safety Authority (EASA) issued an Airworthiness Directive warning of increased wear on a coupling on the engine’s Intermediate Pressure shaft that “present a potential unsafe condition to the aeroplane”.

The coupling allows the axial setting of the turbine to be controlled and the directive says the increased wear would allow the Intermediate Pressure turbine to move rearwards which “would enable contact with static turbine components and would result in loss of engine performance with potential for in-flight shut down”.

That’s dry engineering-speak for a potentially catastrophic in-flight engine failure where turbine blades, spinning at high velocity, smash into the casing or other solid parts of the engine and shatter explosively, much as passengers on board the Qantas flight have described. Fire, from escaping fuel and oil is often the result.

See the Airworthiness Directive in full here

'I was just waiting for us to start going down'

Passenger Tyler Wooster, from Melbourne, Australia, told Channel 4 News: ""All of a sudden I heard a big shotgun-like bang, just a massive bang. It wasn't like a fire, it was just like the top split open and it became a little smoky. I could see the wires hanging out, it didn't look good.



""Everyone was shocked, everyone was wondering what was going to happen. I was just waiting for us to start going down. I could see the skin peeling off the wing - that was pretty nerve-wracking.



""After about three minutes the pilot told us we were running on three engines and everything was fine. Then we had to fly around in circles to get rid of fuel.



""When we landed we finished right on the end of the tarmac - it was a real uncomfortable landing. When we landed everyone was cheering and clapping.""



Modern aero engines, of course, are designed to withstand such failures and contain the blow-out and the shattered turbine blades and, in the case of Qantas Flight QF32 that seems to have been successful.

The EASA ordered more frequent inspections of the critical parts and corrective action where necessary.

Air accident investigators will inevitably want to inspect these parts of the damaged engine closely, and will check Qantas maintenance records to confirm the inspections had been carried out.

Investigators will be trying to establish exactly what happened to the Qantas engine and if a problem such as the one identified here could have occurred. Rolls Royce declined to comment when contacted by Channel 4 News.

A top aircraft engineer in Australia told Channel 4 News that the “most likely scenario”, based on the amount of information available so far, was a problem with the engine.

Paul Cousins, president of the Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association, said: “The pictures we have seen suggest, it looks like a turbine disc has given way in the rear of the aircraft and broke off and looks like that came out and caused panels of the engine to come off.

“That would make that kind of bang that passengers heard.”

What the captain said - announcement to passengers:

""I do apologise, I'm sure you're aware we have a technical issue with our number two engine.



""We have dealt with the situation - the aircraft is secure at this stage. We're going to have to hold for some time while we lighten our load by dumping some fuel and [there are] a number of checks we have to perform.



""I'm sure you are aware we're not proceeding to Sydney at this stage, we're making a left turn now to track back towards Singapore.



""As we progress with this we'll keep you informed. At this stage everything is secure - the aircraft is flying safely. We'll get back to you very shortly with further information.""



""Thank you for your patience.""

Mr Cousins said the damage on the aircraft did not tally with other potential causes – such as a bird striking the plane.

“Both Rolls Royce and Airbus will be taking a keen interest in what has gone on, and Qantas will make sure they have a keen interest, because when something like this happens it damages the reputation of all three organisations, and if there is a manufacturing defect it needs to be fixed,” he added. He also said maintenance was an issue.

“It’s only an initial observation but we also would have concerns over maintenance,” he said. “We would want to know the maintenance history of that aircraft.”","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9833138585090637}",negative,0.9833138585090637,-1
Qantas to replace half of its Rolls-Royce A380 superjumbo engines - The Guardian,"Thu, 18 Nov 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDEwL25vdi8xOC9xYW50YXMtcmVwbGFjZXMtcm9sbHMtcm95Y2UtZW5naW5lc9IBVGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDEwL25vdi8xOC9xYW50YXMtcmVwbGFjZXMtcm9sbHMtcm95Y2UtZW5naW5lcw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Rolls-Royce's troubles deepened today after Australia's Qantas announced that half of the engines made by the British firm on Airbus A380 superjumbos needed to be replaced. Germany's Lufthansa also had to replace a second engine on one of its aircraft.

A Qantas A380 flying from London to Sydney was forced to make an emergency landing two weeks ago when one of its four Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines blew out.

The Australian airline has since grounded its six A380s, while rival Singapore Airlines, which operates 11 of the Rolls-Royce powered aircraft, has recalled three of them and cancelled some flights after discovering oil leaks.

Alan Joyce, Qantas chief executive, said: ""We've been talking to Airbus and Rolls-Royce and we understand that the number [of engines to be replaced] is around 40. We've already replaced three, and there could be more.""

Lufthansa, which replaced a turbine last week as a ""precautionary measure,"" decided to replace a second Rolls engine after discovering a part that could be linked to the Qantas explosion. This will not affect flight schedules. The German carrier said it would continue to perform checks every 10 flight cycles, as required by the European Aviation Safety Agency.

There are 37 A380s in operation worldwide. Twenty of the $350m superjumbos are powered by the Trent 900.

A week ago, Rolls-Royce said it had identified a single faulty part responsible for the Qantas engine explosion over Indonesia. It started a programme to inspect all Trent 900s in service and either repair them or replace the faulty part, so that the entire A380 fleet could be brought back into service. Some faulty engines will be removed and replaced temporarily with new ones while the leaking part is being fixed. The old engine will then be refitted in the plane.

Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, chief executive of Air France-KLM, said: ""I have no doubt whatsoever that Rolls-Royce will deal with this issue, and that the problem will be completely resolved within a few weeks or months.""

Joyce declined to confirm an Australian newspaper report that his airline's six A380s were likely to remain grounded until December or later.

But he did confirm it wanted Airbus to replace some of its existing engines with new ones from aircraft still on the assembly line. The problem with the Trent 900 is thought to develop over time, so the new engines should not present safety issues and will give Rolls-Royce time to come up with a permanent solution. Airbus has orders for almost 200 A380s.

Airbus said todayit would seek full compensation from Rolls-Royce for any costs incurred. Rolls warned last week that the problems would hit its profits this year. Shares in the world's second-largest maker of aircraft engines edged 4p higher to 603.5p.

The A380 programme has already suffered a number of delays. Airbus was due to deliver more than a dozen Rolls-Royce-powered aircraft – mainly to Singapore Airlines, Qantas and Lufthansa – by the end of next year.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.8299237489700317}",negative,0.8299237489700317,-1
Qantas CEO says 'faulty design' may be behind engine failure - The Guardian,"Fri, 05 Nov 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDEwL25vdi8wNS9xYW50YXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtZmF1bHR5LWRlc2lnbtIBTmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDEwL25vdi8wNS9xYW50YXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtZmF1bHR5LWRlc2lnbg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Qantas said the mid-air blowout near Singapore on one of its Airbus superjumbos was likely caused by material failure or faulty design in one of its Rolls-Royce engines, as the carrier ferried stranded passengers to Australia today.

The Qantas CEO, Alan Joyce, told a news conference in Sydney that it was too early to say exactly what caused the engine failure that prompted the emergency landing on Thursday shortly after takeoff from Singapore, and said that a thorough investigation was under way.

The company grounded all six of its fleet of Airbus A380s.

""This is an engine issue and the engines have been maintained by Rolls-Royce since they were installed on the aircraft,"" Joyce said. ""We believe this is probably most likely a material failure or some type of design issue. We don't believe this is related to maintenance in any way.""

It was most serious mid-air incident involving the double-decker Airbus A380 since it debuted in October 2007 with Singapore Airlines flying it to Sydney the same route that Qantas flight QF32 was flying when it was stricken.

Passengers were put on a relief flight bound for Australia on Friday morning, a day after the A380 suffered an engine blowout soon after taking off from Singapore, shooting flames and shedding large metal chunks over an Indonesian island.

It later made a safe emergency landing in Singapore, and Qantas grounded all six of its A380s.

""We have just taken off now. The flight was slightly delayed but we are told to expect a fast short flight of 6 hours 45 minutes,"" passenger Matthew Hewitt said in a text message. Other passengers earlier said some of them were flying on two scheduled Qantas flights to Perth and Sydney, which had already left.

The A380 was carrying 440 passengers and 26 crew. Qantas had earlier said the plane was carrying 433 passengers but corrected the number on Friday without an explanation.

After the plane touched down in Singapore, the engine closest to the fuselage on the left wing had visible burn marks and was missing a plate section that would have been painted with the red kangaroo logo of the airline. The upper part of the left wing also appeared damaged, indicating that one or more pieces from the engine gouged a hole in the wing.

Passenger amateur video from inside the plane showed white vapour coming out of the wing as the A380 landed.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9346787333488464}",negative,0.9346787333488464,-1

Singapore Airlines is switching three of its A380 engines as a “precautionary” measure [EPA]

Singapore Airlines says it will be changing its A380 Rolls Royce engines in the wake of the incident during a Qantas flight.

Singapore Airlines (SIA) announced on Wednesday that it plans to switch the engines on three of its Airbus A380 planes as a “precautionary” measure after finding oil stains on them, almost a week after Qantas, its Australian rival, grounded its own A380 fleet due to an engine failure.

“Based on further analysis of inspection findings as the investigation into last week’s incident involving another operator’s Airbus A380 is progressing, Singapore Airlines will be carrying out precautionary engine changes on three A380s,” the carrier said in a statement.

Lufthansa, a German airline, also said it would change one of its three Airbus A380 planes following talks with Rolls-Royce.

“This has nothing to do with oil leaks detected in engines of Qantas and Singapore Airlines” a spokesman for the airline told the AFP news agency.

Qantas’s six A380s have been grounded for nearly a week, when a Rolls Royce engine partly disintegrated mid-flight, forcing the plane to make an emergency landing.

The incident has triggered investigations into oil leaks inside the Rolls Royce Trent engines – the same model used to power Singapore Airlines’ A380 fleet.

Rolls Royce moved to limit the crisis of confidence on Monday, saying it was making progress in finding out what caused last week’s blowout on the Qantas flight.

‘Design flaw’

Singapore Airlines said the oil stains were unrelated to the Qantas problems.

“We apologise to our customers for flights disruptions that may result,” a spokesperson for the airline said.

Singapore Airlines said the three A380s would be equipped with new engines of the same model, with a minor variation. A380 flights out of Melbourne and Sydney were cancelled on Wednesday.

Qantas said last week that a design flaw could be to blame for the engine explosion on a Sydney-bound flight.

Shukor Yusof, an aviation analyst for Standard and Poor, said the ongoing problems with the engines would give the Airbus A380’s reputation “a bit of a dent, given this is the flagship carrier of SIA, Emirates and other airlines”.

“The incident has been detrimental to the image of the A380s and casts a shadow on the residual value of the aircraft… given that it is relatively new in the market,” he said.

Rolls Royce shares have tumbled since the Qantas A380 plane was forced to make its emergency landing in Singapore.

On Tuesday, the British firm – which had kept a low profile since the incident last week – said they were making progress in understanding the cause of the blowout.

“It is now clear this incident is specific to the Trent 900 engine,” it said in a statement on Wednesday.

“As a result, a series of checks and inspections has been agreed with Airbus, with operators of the Trent 900 powered A380 and with the airworthiness authorities,” it added.

“These are being progressively completed, which is allowing a resumption of operation of aircraft in full compliance with all safety standards”.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9902235865592957}",negative,0.9902235865592957,-1

The boss of Qantas has blamed a design fault in the British-built Rolls-Royce engine for a mid-air explosion during a superjumbo flight from London to Sydney.

Alan Joyce said the blow-out - which pierced the wing of the plane and forced the pilot to make an emergency landing - was down to an issue with one of the Rolls Royce engines and not one of maintenance on the two-year-old A380.

The engine model, the Trent 900 - which is constructed in Rolls Royce's Derby factory where 11,000 people work - has already been at the centre of two previous scares.

Aviation safety officials issued warnings about potential problems in Rolls-Royce jet engines less than three months before one malfunctioned in mid-air, forcing a superjumbo to make an emergency landing.

In August, the pilot on a Lufthansa flight from Tokyo to Frankfurt was forced to shut down an engine shortly before landing, while in September last year, a Singapore Airlines A380 had to return to Paris because of an engine malfunction.

Hose it down: Fire engines spray gallons of water over the plane's engines. A second engine failed to switch off, in addition to the one that blew-up mid-air

Of the 37 A380s in use, 20 - six Qantas, 11 Singapore Airways and three Lufthansa - use the Trent 900 engine.

The European Aviation Safety Authority (EASA) issued an airworthiness directive on August 4 this year concerning 'wear beyond engine manual limits' on the powerful Trent 900.



The directive said the wear could lead to 'loss of engine performance with potential for in-flight shut down' and 'potential unsafe conditions'.

A spokesman for Rolls-Royce said a 'number of basic precautionary engine checks' were being made.

He added: 'We will continue to work closely with our customers as the investigation moves forward. This is at a very early stage and it would be inappropriate to draw any conclusions at this time.'

Mr Joyce told a news conference in Sydney today that it was too early to say exactly what caused the engine blow-out shortly after the plane took off yesterday from Singapore and that a thorough investigation was under way.

'Rolls-Royce have identified a number of potential areas,' said Mr Joyce. 'This issue does not relate to maintenance.'

Qantas has grounded its fleet of six A380s pending safety checks which will take 24 to 48 hours to complete. A team of investigators from Britain's Air Accident Investigation Branch have flown to Australia to examine the failed engine.

'If we don't find any adverse findings in those checks the aircraft will resume operations,' said Mr Joyce.

The Australian Transport Safety Bureau said today there was no indication foul play had contributed to the incident.

In a statement this morning Airbus said it had asked all owners of A380 aircraft with Rolls-Royce engines - including Singapore Airlines and Germany's Lufthansa - to conduct engine checks 'to ensure continuous safe operations of the fleet'.



Singapore Airlines resumed flying its A380s on Friday, lifting a grounding order imposed after the Qantas incident. German airline Lufthansa said it would conduct checks without interrupting flights.

It has now emerged that the Qantas A380 also suffered a problem with another of its engines.

Mr Joyce confirmed a second engine had failed to shut down after landing but said it could have been affected in some way by the first engine mishap, which caused parts to fly off.



'We are still investigating the causes of that,' he said

Passengers said after landing they had been warned of the dangers of using any electronic device, as fire fighters sprayed the aircraft which was leaking fuel from a hole in the wing.



'Obviously in the back of your mind you're concerned about a very hot engine next to leaking fuel,' passenger Christopher Lee said. 'Obviously you're in a state of anxiety.'

Travellers described 'a blast' before seeing smoke and door-size debris shooting past the windows 15 minutes after take-off.

One passenger filmed the emergency from the window, also capturing the pilot's announcement on his phone as the craft turned round to make an emergency landing at Changi Airport, in Singapore.

'I do apologise. We're having a technical issue with our number two engine,' the pilot is heard saying.



PASSENGERS WATCHED DRAMA UNFOLD ON THE IN-FLIGHT TV

Passengers on the Qantas flight watched in horror as the plane's engine burst into flames - live on their in-flight TV screens.

They had been watching footage of the take-off from a tail camera when the engine suffered a blow-out in mid-air.

Passenger Mike Tooke said: 'I was watching the video when there was a loud bang and a puff of smoke from the engine. 'It pretty much disintegrated.'

'We have dealt with the situation at the moment. The aircraft is secure at this stage. We have to hold for some time as we lighten our load by dumping some fuel and (there's) a number of checks we have to perform.

'And as I'm sure you're aware we're not proceeding to Sydney at this stage. We're making a left turn back to Singapore.



'As we progress with this we'll keep you updated. At this stage everything is secure. The aircraft is flying safely and we'll get back to you with more information. Thank you for your patience.'

All 459 people on the flight, many of whom were British, were unhurt after the incident over western Indonesia.

The midair drama unfolded shortly after Flight QF432 had taken off from Singapore on its way to Sydney.

Passenger Lars Sandberg, a DJ from Glasgow, said he was 'just happy to be alive' after the plane landed safely back at Singapore airport.



'When we got off and saw the engine itself and the back casing burnt off, that was pretty scary.



'It was a nerve-wracking experience and I feel a little bit shaken up. I'm just happy to be alive and safe in the terminal building,' he said.

Matt Hewitt from Cheshire, said some people on board had seen bits of a wing 'breaking up' with 'parts sticking up and wires hanging out'.

Six fire engines swarmed around the double-decker aircraft when it landed as a local reporter said he could see smoke still coming from the engine.

The engine closest to the fuselage on the left wing had visible burn marks and was missing a section of plate that would have been painted with the red kangaroo logo of the airline. The upper part of the left wing also appeared to have suffered some damage.

Passenger Rosemary Hegardy, 60, from Sydney, said she heard two bangs and saw flames from her window.

'There were flames - yellow flames came out, and debris came off ... You could see black things shooting through the smoke, like bits of debris,' she said.

German passenger Ulf Waschbusch posted a message on Twitter shortly after landing which read: 'Just emergency landed back in Singapore after engine blew up at take-off and parts ripped through wings. Damn.'

Later, he told Daybreak how he had heard a loud boom noise shortly after take-off and looked out of the window to see what had happened.

'I saw pieces of the engine, number 3 engine, fly off the wing through the wings itself and short bursts of flames for about a second or two at that time,' he said.



'It was one of the scariest things I have ever seen on an aircraft.'

Witnesses on the ground on Batam Island in Indonesia told of hearing a 'very loud explosion'.

People were photographed holding pieces of the engine cover they had found on the ground.



'It sounded like a bomb,' said one witness.

Another witness spoke of hearing a screeching sound before the explosion. 'I thought I heard an explosion and when I looked up I saw a plane going round and round and there was smoke coming out of its tail,' he said.

'Then three or four pieces of metal fell from the sky.'



A schoolteacher said some of the small pieces of debris crashed through the roof of a classroom, but no children were hurt.



Police officer Bobby Baharudin said debris was 'scattered over Batam'.



It was not immediately known if ash from the erupting Mount Merapi volcano had caused the engine problem - the volcano, which is spewing thick clouds, lies to the south of the route the jet was taking.



Geoff Reay, an Australian who lives on Batam Island, said his neighbours heard an explosion and ran out into the street.

'There are bits of aircraft lying on the ground and it landed about 200 yards from where our little boy goes to school. Other bits have fallen down in the suburb of Dutamas,' he said.

Indonesian officials are in the process of finding out if anyone has been killed or injured by the falling debris.

At first it was feared the jet had crashed - widespread rumours through Twitter reported that the plane had come down, resulting in Qantas officials issuing immediate denials.

Kompas, a leading Indonesian newspaper, had reported on its website that it was 'suspected that a Qantas plane exploded in the air near Batam.'

Mr Tatang Kurnia, head of Indonesia's Transport Safety Board, said the plane emptied fuel and returned to Singapore to make an emergency landing shortly after it had taken off from the island republic.

There are currently 37 of the A380 aircraft in operation around the world.

Singapore Airlines has 11 of the superjumbos, Emirates 13, Qantas six, Air France four and German carrier Lufthansa three.

British Airways and Virgin Atlantic are among a number of carriers who have placed orders for A380s. In all, Toulouse-based Airbus has 234 orders from 17 countries for the superjumbo.

METAL FATIQUE, VOLCANIC ASH OR BIRD STRIKE: WHAT WAS TO BLAME?

Technicians inspect the damaged engine By Michael Hanlon

Speculation about the cause of the dramatic engine failure on Flight QF32 includes a bird strike, a design flaw, a one-off manufacturing defect or even ash from an erupting volcano a few hundred miles from where the explosion occurred.

Only after close examination of the wrecked Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engine, plus the debris which landed on Indonesia’s Batam Island, will engineers be able to say for sure what happened.

What is known is that the engine, unique to the Airbus A380, virtually disintegrated ten to 15 minutes into the flight from Singapore to Sydney.

Photographs show what looks like part of a turbine mounting disc – a hefty piece of solid titanium from the core of the turbofan engine – being examined near where it fell.

A major component breaking out of the engine cowling indicates a catastrophic internal failure.

This was not a case of ‘contained’ engine failure, which would lead to an orderly shutdown and an undramatic landing on the three remaining power plants. As well as the rotor disc punching its way out of the engine cowling, pictures taken by a passenger show the port wing above the engine support clearly punctured in at least two places near its leading edge.

Reports also suggest a breakdown in the aircraft’s hydraulic control systems, and that the pilots were unable to shut down engine number one, alongside the stricken motor.

The Airbus may have had a lucky escape – if hot engine components had punctured the main fuel tank in the wing, it could have exploded.

If the accident is traced to a design flaw, with the engine or with the aircraft as a whole, it will be a disaster for Airbus and Rolls-Royce.

The largest passenger aircraft in the world has been beset by problems since the double-decked behemoth first took to the air six years ago. The aircraft’s safety record was untarnished since it entered commercial service in October 2007, but there has been a string of issues that have beset the A380, including managerial shambles at the international Airbus consortium, cost over-runs and delays.

The focus, inevitably, is on Rolls-Royce to supply an explanation, and reassure airlines and passengers that if there is an endemic fault with this engine, it will be fixed.

According to Professor Jeff Jupp, former technical director of Airbus UK, the Rolls-Royce engine is unlikely to be inherently unsafe, because it is not a completely new powerplant, but ‘an evolution of earlier designs’. More likely, he says, the failure resulted from a one-off ‘flaw in metal quality as opposed to a design flaw’.

A bird strike is possible, Professor Jupp says, although it would have had to have been a large bird. Like all engines, the Trent will have been subjected to the ‘chicken test’, when an 8lb bird is fired at a running engine on a testbed at several hundred miles an hour.

Reports say the engine failed at least ten minutes into the flight, by which time the aircraft would have climbed to more than 10,000ft, making a bird strike even less likely.

Finally, volcanic ash, although certainly present over Indonesia, is unlikely to have caused such catastrophic and sudden damage.

While attention is focused on the Rolls-Royce engine, it is not impossible that a failure of one of the other aircraft systems was to blame.

Experts point out that even a catastrophic engine failure such as this would be very unlikely to lead to a crash; the A380 is designed to be flown on just two engines.

Superjumbo engine failure hurts Airbus sales drive - Times of Malta,"Fri, 05 Nov 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZm1hbHRhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL3N1cGVyanVtYm8tZW5naW5lLWZhaWx1cmUtaHVydHMtYWlyYnVzLXNhbGVzLWRyaXZlLjMzNDc1ONIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The dramatic mid-air loss of engine power by a Qantas A380 superjumbo was a severe blow to the image of European planemaker Airbus, just as it hopes to sell dozens of jets to China.

Yesterday’s drama, which saw the ultramodern jet making an emergency landing in Singapore with 466 on board and smoke trailing from a broken jet engine, could hardly have come at a worse time for the French-based firm.

Airbus and its parent company EADS had hoped the expected announcement of a major Chinese contract during President Hu Jintao’s visit to Paris would put an end to a streak of bad publicity surrounding its planes.

Instead, early A380 customer Qantas has grounded its fleet of the company’s massive flagship, and air crash investigators are examining how some kind of explosion had knocked out the engine and severed part of its outer housing.

French flag-carrier Air France has not grounded its A380s, noting that its planes use jet engines made by Engine Alliance – a consortium of Pratt and Wittney, General Electric and Safran.

Qantas, on the other hand, uses engines from Britain’s Rolls Royce, and these are expected to come under scrutiny, along with the plane itself, which has only been in service three years and has never had a major accident.

Aviation officials have urged calm, insisting that a four-engined jet can lose one of its four jets and still land within normal emergency procedures.

But while the investigation continues, markets are nervous. In Paris, EADS shares fell 3.99 per cent in a rising market. In London, Rolls Royce stock plunged by even more, losing 4.3 per cent on the news.

“For pilots, an engine cutting out is not an exceptional event, even if it doesn’t happen every morning,” said Air France captain Eric Bernard. “What’s new here is that it has happened to an A380 for the first time.”

Mr Bernard said that an experienced pilot should be able to land a plane with one engine out without drama, as appears to be the case with the Qantas crew, who turned back six minutes out of Singapore and landed without incident.

Nevertheless, industry analysts said Airbus had suffered a blow.

“It’s clearly an image problem, with Qantas’ fleet stuck on the deck,” said one expert, speaking on condition of anonymity so as no to ruffle feathers in France’s close-knit aviation industry.

“The punishment is immediate, because the markets know that this implies extra costs to get these planes into service,” he said, referring to Airbus’ slow delivery of the flagship A380, marked by a series of technical delays.

He nevertheless said he thought the brutal drop in EADS share price “exaggerated”, given that the problem may turn out to be Rolls Royce’s.

He and another expert pointed to Air France and Emirates’ decision to keep flying on their Engine Alliance engines as a sign that the industry is leaning towards the suspicion that the motors and not the airframe are at fault.

Investigations are continuing into other recent Airbus incidents, including the loss last July of an Air France A330, which plunged into the Atlantic en route between Rio and Paris with the loss of all 226 people on board. No firm cause for that crash has been established, but since the accident Airbus has ordered all customers to replace the model of air speed probe fitted on the lost jet with a newer generation model less prone to icing up.

Mr Hu began his visit to Paris yesterday, and EADS hopes to conclude deals for $7 billion worth of Airbus airliners. China Southern Airlines has already indicated it might buy 26 of them for $3.78 million.

For its part, Airbus was insisting yesterday that the Singapore incident is a matter for Rolls Royce and promising the A380 delivery schedule – including one for Qantas by the end of the year – would remain unchanged.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9017254710197449}",negative,0.9017254710197449,-1
Rolls-Royce to take back A380 engines from Airbus – The Mail & Guardian - Mail and Guardian,"Tue, 16 Nov 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vbWcuY28uemEvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDEwLTExLTE2LXJvbGxzcm95Y2UtdG8tdGFrZS1iYWNrLWEzODAtZW5naW5lcy1mcm9tLWFpcmJ1cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Engine maker Rolls-Royce has asked Airbus EAD to return some Airbus A380 engines from production lines so it can use them to replace faulty ones on airplanes already in service.

Rolls-Royce’s move could be another blow to a much-delayed A380 programme as Airbus was scheduled to deliver over a dozen Rolls-Royce-powered A380s — primarily to Singapore Airlines, Qantas and Lufthansa by the end of next year.

But both Singapore Airlines and Qantas, with a combined 22 A380s still to be delivered, said on Tuesday they had not been informed of any delivery delays. Qantas said it expected none.

“I can confirm that Rolls-Royce is arranging to supply some new engines from the production line to replace some engines removed from the serviced aircraft,” an Airbus spokesperson said, without saying which airlines would receive those engines.

The Airbus A380 — the world’s largest passenger aircraft with a list price of about $350-million — has been hit by safety concerns after a Rolls-Royce engine partly disintegrated mid-flight, forcing a fully laden Qantas plane to make an emergency landing on November 4.

Airlines using the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines have been ordered by European aviation authorities to undertake major tests, which analysts said were so strenuous they would likely disrupt schedules.

“Until this problem is fully resolved I think the situation with the delivery of A380 to customers … will be in jeopardy,” Standard & Poor’s analyst Sukhor Yusof said.

Airbus said last week that the problem with Rolls-Royce engine could have an impact on its delivery target for 2011.

The price to pay

Airbus is in the process of arranging for engines to be taken off the A380 production line in Toulouse in France and shipped to Sydney to be fitted to the grounded Qantas aircraft, according to a report in the Aviation Business, which cited Airbus chief operating officer John Leahy in Sydney last week.

Qantas’ fleet of six A380 aircraft have remained grounded since the incident earlier this month.

“The cost is roughly $1-million for Qantas for each day the A380 is grounded. But the biggest issue is reputational. It’s down to the consumer and there’s a price to pay there as well,” an Australian analyst, who declined to be identified, said.

However, the problem would not lead to cancellation of orders as it was the problem with the engine instead of the airframe, he added.

Qantas — set to take five A380s by the end of next year, including three within the next few months — said it had not been notified of any delivery delays and expected deliveries to remain on schedule.

Singapore Airlines spokesperson Nicholas Ionides said the carrier had not been informed by Airbus of any delay on its A380 delivery schedule.

The world’s second-biggest carrier by market capitalisation currently operates 11 A380s and is scheduled to receive eight more before end-March 2012.

Rolls-Royce shares are down nearly 9% since the incident. Qantas shares have lost about 5% since then, while Singapore Airlines shares have been flat. – Reuters","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.970403254032135}",negative,0.970403254032135,-1

Australia’s Qantas Airways, which has never suffered a fatal jet crash in its 90-year history, said it was grounding all six of its A380s following the incident.

Qantas said flight QF32 developed major engine trouble just six minutes into a flight from Singapore to Sydney, and it dumped fuel over Indonesia before returning to Singapore’s Changi Airport.

There were no injuries to the 433 passengers or the 26 crew, officials said.

Metal debris slammed into areas of the Indonesian city of Batam, on an island just south of Singapore.

Yanes Tri, 55, said a “large piece of metal” punched a hole in her house. “I was shocked but I’m grateful I wasn’t standing next to the wall,” she said.

Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said the plane had experienced “a significant engine failure” to one of its four Rolls-Royce Trent 900 jets. The British engine maker pledged to work with Qantas to identify the problem.

“We will suspend those A380 services until we are completely confident that Qantas safety requirements have been met,” Mr Joyce told reporters in Sydney.

The four other airlines that fly the world’s largest passenger plane – Singapore Airlines, Air France, Emirates and Lufthansa – all said they had no plans to ground their own fleets.

But Airbus and Rolls-Royce later advised Singapore Airlines, which uses the same engine model as Qantas in its A380s, to conduct technical checks on its aircraft.

Airbus, which is betting its future on the commercial viability of the double-decker plane, said the Qantas incident had been “significant” but stressed the A380 was safe to fly on three engines.

“We are not playing down the incident, but it is covered in the certification procedures,” a spokesman for the French-based company said, as France’s air accident investigation agency launched a probe.

After disembarking, relieved passengers recounted the incident to reporters.

German passenger Ulf Wasch­busch said there was a loud boom and flames on the plane’s left wing soon after take-off.

“Something ruptured the left wing,” Mr Waschbusch, a technology executive based in Singapore, said.

“Everyone was surprisingly calm on the plane. We are not going crazy at all,” he said. “The crew helped tremendously. I felt in good hands. Qantas did a great job in keeping us safe.”

Six fire engines swarmed the jet on landing, spraying liquid on it, according to an AFP reporter at the Singapore airport.

One of the engines on the plane’s left wing was blackened and its rear cowling was missing.

Passengers began emerging in the arrival hall about five hours after landing, but were whisked away by security officers as a throng of journalists shouted questions.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8835065960884094}",neutral,0.8835065960884094,0

The Rolls-Royce family of Trent engines power more than half of the world's modern wide-bodied aircraft. Dating back to 1995, the first version of the Trent was the 700 series, chosen to power Cathay Pacific's fleet of A330 aircraft and opening the door for the Derby-based company's new family of commercial airline power plants. Trent engines have their roots in the RB211, originally designed to power the Lockheed TriStar in the 1970s. The Trent 900 is one of the latest incarnations of the engine to enter service and was developed by Rolls-Royce for the Airbus A380. Other engines in the Trent family include the 500 (for the Airbus A340) and the 800, built for the Boeing 777 which entered service in 1996. Twelve years later a British Airways Boeing 777 flying from Beijing to London, crash-landed at Heathrow after both of its Trent 800 engines lost power during final approach. The investigation found the cause was ice being released from the fuel system leading to a restriction in the flow of fuel to the engines. The Trent 900 first flew on a test aircraft in 1994 Modifications to the engine's heat exchanger were ordered and later extended to the 500 and 700 series engines after a similar loss of power in one engine of an Airbus A330. Production delay The development of the Trent 900 was not without its problems. Rolls-Royce announced it would develop the engine in 1996 and it made its maiden flight on a test aircraft in 2004. However, delays in the development of the Airbus A380 meant that, in 2006, production of the Trent 900 was suspended for around 12 months. When production recommenced in 2007 Rolls-Royce aimed to deliver 100 of the engines each year. The engine maker's safety record is generally excellent. However, the incident with engine number two of a Qantas Airbus A380 in November 2010 is not the first sustained by the Australian carrier. This is the second failure Qantas has sustained with Rolls-Royce engines in three months. On 1 September the airline said a Boeing 747 bound for Sydney returned to San Francisco after an engine failed and was shut off soon after take-off. The explosion on that occasion was in an RB211 and blew a hole in the engine's outer casing. In August 2010 a Trent 1000 engine blew up on Rolls-Royce's Derby test bed. The failure of the engine, built to power the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, resulted in the engine being destroyed and damage to the test bed facility.
