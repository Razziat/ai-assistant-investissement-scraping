Airbus tells French lawmakers there's no 'Plan B' for FCAS - Defense News,"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9nbG9iYWwvZXVyb3BlLzIwMjEvMDMvMTcvYWlyYnVzLWV4ZWNzLXRlbGwtZnJlbmNoLWxhd21ha2Vycy10aGV5LWhhdmUtbm8tcGxhbi1iLWZvci1mY2FzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"COLOGNE, Germany — Airbus executives said they see no viable “Plan B” for the embattled Future Combat Air System, as Eric Trappier, the CEO of fellow prime contractor Dassault, suggested earlier this month.

Antoine Bouvier, the head of Airbus strategy, mergers and public affairs, and Dirk Hoke, CEO of the aerospace giant’s defense division, testified before the French Senate’s foreign affairs committee on March 17 in an effort calm tensions boiling in the trinational program, known as FCAS (or SCAF in French).

Airbus and Dassault are the two main contractors for the program, with work shares to be equally divided between partner nations France, Germany and Spain. The participants had envisioned kicking off the next project stage, dubbed Phase 1B, by this summer. But new disagreements over governance procedures and the sharing of industry secrets have put the program’s future in question.

The two Airbus executives sought to pin the program’s success to the broader vision of a more independent Europe. Failure would mean the Americans can swoop in and sell their F-35 aircraft to a continent in need of its own advanced warplane industry, Bouvier argued.

“There is is no ‘Plan B,’ ” he said, referring to the suggestion that Dassault’s CEO made before the same committee a week prior.

The Dassault boss lamented that the division of labor following Spain’s inclusion would make his job as the main risk taker on the program’s central element, the Next-Generation Fighter, near impossible. In addition, Airbus was on track to become too dominant a player, given that the company also has roots in Spain and Germany, he argued.

Bouvier sought to dispel the idea of Dassault getting outplayed, noting that Airbus teaming arrangements include other French industry heavyweights such as Thales and MBDA. Airbus is firmly entrenched in the business of French defense, he said, suggesting the company should not be viewed as leaning too German when it comes to FCAS.

The bias on both sides goes something like this, according to Bouvier: Some Germans think the French want to build a French airplane with German money, while some French think the Germans want to steal trade secrets and build a weapon of their own.

The “invective and polemic” surrounding the program — French business newspaper La Tribune had recently trashed Germany’s FCAS motives in a series of articles — was beginning to “pollute” the debate, Bouvier warned.

Speaking in French during the in-person committee meeting in Paris, Hoke said Airbus made a new offer for Dassault to retain four of six strategic work packages. In addition, negotiations were ongoing about contract language for Phase 1B to preserve companies‘ unique know-how in critical domains.

“That is easier said than done,” Hoke said.

A speedily inked deal is critical so Germany’s parliament has time to study and approve it before the summer recess in late June, Hoke said. Timing and the political context in Germany is the reason why Airbus has largely kept quiet about the FCAS kerfuffle, he added, as there is no telling how the issue would fare if dragged into Germany’s election season.

Sky Perfect JSAT orders first Airbus satellite - SpaceNews,"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9za3ktcGVyZmVjdC1qc2F0LW9yZGVycy1maXJzdC1haXJidXMtc2F0ZWxsaXRlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TAMPA, Fla. — Japanese satellite operator Sky Perfect JSAT has ordered a spacecraft from Airbus for the first time, choosing the European aerospace giant to build Superbird-9 for a launch in 2024.

Superbird-9 will be based on Airbus’ reconfigurable payload platform OneSat, which can steer and reassign beams for different customers and services.

JSAT said the geostationary (GEO) satellite will replace a key broadcasting mission, while simultaneously providing high-speed broadband services to maritime, aero and other markets.

It will use Ku-band to provide broadcast and broadband services, primarily over Japan and Eastern Asia, and also have Ka-band capability.

The Japanese company expects to invest 30 billion yen ($275 million) in the project.

“This is a landmark contract for Airbus in Japan and it marks the first time a Japanese telecommunications operator has ordered a satellite from Europe,” said Jean-Marc Nasr, head of space systems at Airbus.

The contract announcement comes days after Airbus said it secured the first commercial GEO signed order of 2021.

Eutelsat Communications said March 22 it picked Airbus to build Eutelsat 36D, which is also a replacement satellite slated for launch in 2024.

Airbus expects 15-18 GEO orders this year, with the majority being replacement missions.

That would be a notable improvement for the industry, after satellite manufacturers booked just 14 orders in 2017 and 2018 combined.

In 2019, there were 15 commercially competed GEO communications spacecraft and two military comsats awarded without open bidding.

The picture became complicated in 2020. Despite the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, last year saw a significant uptick in GEO orders.

However, the vast majority of those were made to help satellite operators clear C-band spectrum for terrestrial use. Analysts do not expect a similar event to happen any time soon.

Story behind name: why is it called Airbus A380? - AeroTime,"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjc1MjMtc3RvcnktYmVoaW5kLW5hbWUtd2h5LWlzLWl0LWNhbGxlZC1haXJidXMtYTM4MNIBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjc1MjMtc3RvcnktYmVoaW5kLW5hbWUtd2h5LWlzLWl0LWNhbGxlZC1haXJidXMtYTM4MC9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Just recently, the last superjumbo rolled out of its hangar and departed for its maiden flight. While the history of the A380 does not end with that – the giant will most likely remain flying in the skies for decades to come – the end of the aircraft production is still a bitter date for its fans.

Nevertheless, it should be remembered that this aircraft’s birth was as dramatic as its size. For over a decade Airbus, and its various divisions, worked on the concept of the world’s largest airliner. It went through various stages, one weirder than another, and became the aircraft we know and love through thousands of decisions made by hundreds of engineers.

One of those decisions was the name of the aircraft. Believe it or not, there was a very high chance the A380 would be called differently. Through its development, it had a lot of names before the company settled on the current one.

Birth of the A3XX

The first project that would later become the A380 was initiated by Airbus in 1988. It was called the UHCA: Ultra High Capacity Aircraft. Quite predictably, one of the goals for it was to break Boeing’s monopoly in the jumbo market and create something that could rival the legendary 747. But it would have also competed with other similar projects by Lockheed Martin and McDonnel Douglas. Building a massive double-decker aircraft just seemed like a perfect idea at the time.

The first idea for the UHCA – drafted by Airbus engineer and the mastermind behind the A330 and A340 Jean Roeder – was to attach two A340 fuselages to each other side-by-side, making the aircraft ultra-wide, instead of double-decked. This model was called HDB (horizontal double-bubble), and while the concept did not progress much further, it became the earliest version of what would later become the A380.

Still not throwing away the HDB, the team behind the ULCA project came up with another idea. They pitted various Airbus subsidiaries against each other to design the superjumbo, with an expectation to eventually merge their creations into one. So, in the early 90s, a whole bunch of European double-decker jet proposals appeared, such as the DASA A2000 and the BAe AC14. While all of them could be considered as predecessors of the A380 – as the final aircraft inherited a lot of their features – there was no chance that either one of them would be built or that Airbus’ final superjumbo would be called by any of their names.

In 1993, three of them got joined together and the real development of the A380 began. Those were the DASA P502/P602 (further developments of the A2000), the BAe AC 14, and the Aerospatiale ASX 500/600. All of them were called the Family 1 by Airbus, and the working title of the aircraft that could be born from joining them was the 3E P500-100 (smaller version) and the 3E P500-200 (larger version).

Variants, variants, variants

Of course, we know that a new Airbus aircraft with a name like that would sound weird. Airbus names start with “A3” – a tradition that began a long time ago and has a story of its own.

The new airplane would have to follow that format. But what number would it get? Airbus already had A300, A310, A320, A330, and A340. The logical answer would be A350, right?

For many, that was not apparent. At this early stage, Airbus did not want to reveal too much and renamed the project to the A3YY. This meant that the airplane was on route to become a real member of the Airbus lineup, quite a big deal for the company. It was also a rather brief moment. For one reason or another, the “Y” got changed into “X” shortly and when Airbus started presenting their new creation to the wide public, it already had a name that stuck to it for many years to come: the A3XX.

However, at that point it was still not clear how the airplane would eventually look. Even the HDB, the twin-A340 design, was still being seriously considered, by this point becoming the A3XX-H600. The conjoined 3E P500 project, a collection of Family 1 airplanes, got designated the A3XX-V600.

By 1994, the H600 was thrown away as not economical enough and the Family 1 got combined into one aircraft. The A3XX took its now-familiar shape, with two versions: the base A3XX-100 with approximately 500 seats and the A3XX-200 with approximately 600 seats. Meanwhile, its evolutionary stages, with subtle changes to the airframe, got assigned internal designations: Status 1, Status 2, Status 3, and so on, until Status 10. The tenth variant was what we would recognize as the A380 today.

With the design nearly finished, the talks with potential customers began. A long-range variant, the A3XX-100R, was added to the lineup in 1996, following some recommendations. In 1997, it was joined by the A3XX-50, a shortened variant specifically for Lufthansa (LHAB) (LHA). The A3XX-100E freighter (later renamed the A3XX-100F) and the A3XX-100C combi (half-freighter half-passenger aircraft) were also in the works. Airbus was drawing crowds at airshows with scale models of the A3XX, and the future seemed bright.

Rebranding

But then, several problems struck. The Asian financial crisis began, forcing many potential customers to back off. The Airbus design team was also unable to meet the required fuel efficiency levels that would make the A3XX much more attractive than the competing Boeing 747. The program slowed down. Had it not, there was a large chance that the superjumbo would have been called the Airbus A350 to this day, with its -50, -100, -200, and other variants ‒ a logical continuation after the A340.

By 2000, there were fears that the aircraft would never see the light of day, just like many of its superjumbo peers. Despite an interest from airlines, a new push was needed. And a rebranding.

In the last months of that year, Airbus came to a decision: the aircraft was going to be launched and it would have the final name: the A380.

There are many versions of why the company jumped from “4” straight to “8”. Some say it was because such a sequence left the gap that could later be filled by intermediary aircraft – larger than the A340, but not as large as the A380. Others say that it was because “8” is considered a lucky number in China – a badly needed symbolic boost, considering the company’s relative failure in Asia.

While those are valid guesses, and likely contributed to the decision in their own right, the man behind that decision is of a different opinion. As Guy Norris and Mark Wagner write in their book “Airbus A380: superjumbo of the 21st century”, Noël Forgeard – the CEO of Airbus SAS at the time – had a different idea.

“8 suggests double-decks, one on top of the other,” Forgeard reportedly said. And so, the decision was made, and the name got stuck to the aircraft.

The whole proposed family underwent a significant revamp too. The A3XX-50, the smallest variant, was dropped. Another, larger stretch was proposed. The old designation system – with -100, -200, and so on – was dropped due to sounding “obsolete”, and the new outlook of the family was drafted, with numbers that would better emphasize the size and the advancement of the airplane: the A380-700, the A380-800, and the A380-900. With these three models, the aircraft was launched. Later joined by the ultimate version, the A380-1000, and the freighter A380F, the aircraft seemed to be the successful forerunner of the new market. Until it wasn’t. But that is a story for another day."

Airbus' A220-300 is among the newest passenger aircraft in American skies, and it just started flying passengers for Delta in November.

The pandemic masked the aircraft's arrival but Delta has already taken delivery of six planes that offer an impressive passenger experience with in-flight entertainment and mood lighting among them.

On the technical side, the A220-300 boasts an impressive transcontinental range of around 3,400 nautical miles and seats 130 passengers in Delta's configuration that includes a first class cabin. Fuel-efficient Pratt & Whitney engines also give Delta a fuel savings of around 20% when compared to similar aircraft.

Delta first began flying the smaller A220-100 in 2020 as part massive order for the aircraft that was threatened when Boeing opened a trade dispute against Canada's Bombardier, the plane's original manufacturer. Airbus ultimately took over the program, rebranding the aircraft as the A220, and the deal continued with Boeing later losing the dispute.

JetBlue Airways is the only other US airline to operate the Airbus A220-300 with plans to start passenger service in the spring between Boston and Fort Lauderdale. David Neeleman's new startup, Breeze Airways, also plans to use the aircraft as its flagship but won't take delivery of its first model until later this year.

This portal, called Pegasus, will allow the French Armed Forces to augment the usage of available capacities on both military and commercial satellites.

The Copernicus project also aims to improve the operability of the multi-satellite communications network Comcept.

Airbus-designed Comcept was commissioned by the French Armed Forces in 2017.

Besides the Ku- and C-band capacities of commercial satellites, Comcept uses the broadband Ka-band transmission capacities of the ATHENA-FINDUS, a Franco-Italian military satellite.

According to Airbus, Comcept can use the high-speed Ka-band of future satellites SYRACUSE 4A and 4B.

Last month, Thales was selected as prime contractor for the ground segment’s development and deployment for capacity expansion of the Syracuse IV system for the French Armed Forces.

Syracuse is a suite of secured telecommunication satellites designed for the French Armed Forces to enable continuous communication between mainland France and other military units deployed worldwide.

Three generations of Syracuse satellites have been deployed during 1984 and 2015.

The Syracuse IV programme is designed to replace the Syracuse 3A and Syracuse 3B satellites currently in orbit, with the first satellite scheduled to enter service next year."
Airbus to boost “cold” technology testing as part of its decarbonisation roadmap - Airbus,"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0wMy1haXJidXMtdG8tYm9vc3QtY29sZC10ZWNobm9sb2d5LXRlc3RpbmctYXMtcGFydC1vZi1pdHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse, 29 March 2021 – Airbus has launched “Advanced Superconducting and Cryogenic Experimental powertraiN Demonstrator” (ASCEND) to explore the impact of superconducting materials and cryogenic temperatures on the performance of an aircraft’s electrical propulsion systems.



The introduction of superconducting materials can lower electrical resistance, meaning that electrical current can supply power without energy loss. When coupled with liquid hydrogen at cryogenic temperatures (-253 degrees Celsius) electrical systems can be cooled in order to significantly increase the performance of the overall electric propulsion system.



Airbus will use ASCEND to explore the feasibility of these promising technologies in order to optimise propulsion architecture ready for low-emission and zero-emission flight. Results are expected to show the potential for component weight and electrical losses to be at least halved, as the volume and complexity of systems installation is reduced, as well as a reduction in voltage to below 500V, compared to current systems.



ASCEND will assess electric architectures from several hundred kilowatts to multi-megawatt applications with and without liquid hydrogen on board.



Airbus will design and build the demonstrator over the next three years at its E-Aircraft System House. Solutions that could be adapted to turboprop, turbofan and hybrid propeller engines will be tested and evaluated by the end of 2023. It will support Airbus’ decision making-process for the type of propulsion system architecture required for future aircraft. ASCEND is also expected to support performance improvements on existing and future propulsion systems across the entire Airbus portfolio, including helicopters, eVTOLs, as well as regional and single-aisle aircraft.



The demonstrator is hosted within Airbus UpNext, an Airbus subsidiary created to give future technologies a development fast-track by building demonstrators at speed and scale, evaluating, maturing and validating new products and services that encompass radical technological breakthroughs.

An A350 fuelled by 100% SAF just took off - Airbus,"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIxLTAzLWFuLWEzNTAtZnVlbGxlZC1ieS0xMDAtc2FmLWp1c3QtdG9vay1vZmbSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The study of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)’s impact on the full scope of aircraft emissions has been few and far between. An Airbus-led project is looking to change that by conducting a series of flight and ground tests aimed at shedding light on the emissions performance of 100% SAF.

On a chilly but pleasant March day, an A350 moved into position, revved its jet engines and took off from the runway at Blagnac airport in Toulouse, France. But this was no ordinary flight: the test aircraft was fuelled by 100% SAF.

Today, all Airbus aircraft are certified to fly with up to a 50% blend of SAF mixed with kerosene. But the emissions performance of SAF when unblended with any type of fossil fuel has remained a question mark across the industry—until now.

The Airbus-led Emission and Climate Impact of Alternative Fuels project, in collaboration with Rolls-Royce, German aerospace research centre DLR and oil refining company Neste, has set its sights on providing insight on that very question.

Airbus SAF Flight Test show more show less Airbus SAF Flight Test 17032021 STVA V4 Web

This research project will help us to better understand the impact of unblended SAF on the full scope of aircraft emissions, while supporting SAF’s future certification for blends that exceed today’s maximum of 50%.

- Steven Le Moing, Airbus New Energy Programme Manager

Throughout the year, the project will test the emissions performance of 100% SAF on one engine of a Trent XWB-powered A350 test aircraft in the air and on the ground. It is the first in-flight study of its kind using a commercial passenger jet.

“SAF is one of the aviation industry’s best low-carbon solutions with an immediate impact on CO2 emissions today,” Steven Le Moing, Airbus New Energy Programme Manager, says. “This research project will help us to better understand the impact of unblended SAF on the full scope of aircraft emissions, while supporting SAF’s future certification for blends that exceed today’s maximum of 50%.”

Ground tests will measure particulate emissions in local environments, while flight tests will assess the volume and consistency of contrails. Initial fuel clearance tests have already begun.

“The first flight went exceptionally well,” explains Emiliano Requena Esteban, Airbus Flight Test Engineer. “There’s no perceptible difference in engine behaviour between jet fuel and SAF. It's very exciting for me to contribute to a project that participates in the decarbonisation of our skies!”

The A350 test aircraft is refuelled with 100% SAF before its first clearance test flight.

Understanding the SAF impact on aircraft emissions

The test flight, conducted on March 16, 2021, is the first in a series of clearance tests scheduled this month to analyse the safety of 100% SAF. Then, in April, DLR’s Falcon 20E ""chase"" aircraft equipped with a “sniffer” (i.e. sensors) will follow 50 metres behind the A350 test aircraft to measure the emissions directly from the SAF-fuelled engine exhaust.

Indeed, over the past decade, SAF has demonstrated its efficacy in reducing CO2 emissions when used as a substitute for conventional or fossil-based jet fuel. However, little research has been carried out on how SAF can have a positive impact on other aircraft emissions. This means the industry can paint only half the picture of aviation’s overall climate impact.

“Decarbonising aviation is not just about reducing CO2 emissions,” Steven explains. “At Airbus, our priority is to deal with the complete climate-impact challenge, which includes overall greenhouse gases and other aircraft emissions. Our decarbonisation plan focuses on accelerating technology development to this end, in complement to a dynamic deployment of SAF.”

For this reason, the project will help to better analyse the impact of other climate-relevant emissions from aircraft engines, including:

Carbon monoxide (CO)

Nitrogen dioxide (NOx)

Water vapour

Soot

Aerosol and sulphate aerosol particles

Contrails and contrail cirrus clouds (i.e. clouds of ice crystals produced by aircraft engines at high altitude under certain meteorological conditions)

Unblended SAF of European origin

The 100% SAF is a key component of the research project. The series of flight and ground tests will compare findings from the unblended SAF mixture made from Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) against those of standard kerosene and low-sulphur kerosene. HEFA feedstock generally consists of globally sourced animal fat and used cooking oil, but locally sourced feedstock from specific regions can also be used. The feedstock supplied to Airbus for the project is of EU origin.

In addition, the 117 tonnes of neat SAF that will be used for the entire test campaign were entirely produced in Europe and supplied by Finland-based Neste. The SAF refining process was carried out at the company’s refinery in Porvoo, Finland. After refining, the SAF was then transported by ship to Rotterdam, where the final processing step, known as fractionation, took place. From Rotterdam, transportation via truck brought the SAF to Toulouse, France in ISO containers.

Initial results from the ground and flight tests are expected later in 2021 and more complete results in 2022. The Emission and Climate Impact of Alternative Fuels project, focused on SAF’s emissions performance, is one of several climate-impact programmes that Airbus is currently leading with its partners in an effort to support significant reductions in aircraft emissions across the aviation industry in the decades to come."
World-class alternative-propulsion testing starts here - Airbus,"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIxLTAzLXdvcmxkLWNsYXNzLWFsdGVybmF0aXZlLXByb3B1bHNpb24tdGVzdGluZy1zdGFydHMtaGVyZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"There is no better place to assess the possibilities and limitations of tomorrow’s propulsion technologies than Europe’s largest facility dedicated to just that—the E-Aircraft Systems House. Here, Airbus engineers are leveraging the lessons learned from key electrification initiatives to offer world-class testing to a variety of alternative-propulsion projects across Airbus—and beyond.

The wealth of alternative-propulsion technologies currently in development is reinventing the way the transport industry approaches the design and implementation of future mobility solutions. For the aerospace industry, the challenge is to adapt and mature these leading-edge technologies, notably by increasing power, decreasing weight and reducing cost.

It is a not-so-simple task, especially as electrification and hybridisation—particularly when combined with greater autonomy and digitalisation—require novel means of interacting with and controlling the propulsion system. To get there, these systems must be simulated and tested at a facility with the equipment and amenities necessary to adequately put them through the paces.

In Europe, this facility has a name: the E-Aircraft Systems House.

The E-Aircraft Systems House is Europe's leading facility to test alternative-propulsion systems and alternative fuels.

In 2016, Airbus first opened the doors of its E-Aircraft Systems site. Back then, the building featured about 225 m2 of medium-voltage testing space. Three years later, a new 2,500-m2 facility —complete with two GenSet test beds, four propulsion unit test beds, two control rooms and a power-distribution hall—was added, thereby significantly expanding high-voltage testing capabilities.

Today, a flurry of activity is underway at E-Aircraft Systems. The team is hard at work, providing design and testing support in the following key areas:

Hybrid-electric system architecture integration (i.e. system layout and installation, clearance, simulations, etc.)

Integration of all associated subsystems (i.e. propellers, gearboxes, motors, power electronics, fuel cells, cooling systems, batteries, control systems and software, etc.)

Power generation in hybrid architectures (i.e. batteries, fuel cells) using alternative energy sources (i.e. sustainable aviation fuel, hydrogen)

At E-Aircraft Systems, we can offer world-class testing for multiple components and architectures related to electric-propulsion systems.

- Benjamin Struss, Airbus Head of E-Aircraft Systems

From medium- to high-voltage testing

Testing activities at E-Aircraft Systems are carried out at two distinct facilities, depending on the level of voltage:

Medium-voltage testing : This facility is dedicated to testing the electric powertrain of helicopter-size aircraft, such as eVTOLs.

: This facility is dedicated to testing the electric powertrain of helicopter-size aircraft, such as eVTOLs. High-voltage testing: This facility is dedicated to testing the motors and engines of passenger-size commercial aircraft.

“Airbus is spearheading several alternative-propulsion projects across its business lines, from CityAirbus at Airbus Helicopters to ZEROe at Airbus,” explains Benjamin Struss, Airbus Head of E-Aircraft Systems. “So we have high demand to test various zero-emission technologies at our E-Aircraft Systems facilities.”

For example, in 2019 and early 2020, various aspects related to the E-Fan X’s hybrid-electric propulsion system architecture were designed, in close cooperation with partners, at E-Aircraft Systems. These aspects included the propulsion unit, and the transmission, energy storage, and power generation systems. Although E-Fan X has now come to a close, the lessons learned on hybrid-electric architecture integration and network installation rules for a 3,000-VDC (Volts Direct Current) unit have helped to foster the engineering know-how needed to better evaluate the performance of other alternative-propulsion projects.

Meanwhile, at the medium-voltage facility, the CityAirbus demonstrator’s electric-propulsion system has been undergoing testing since 2018. As a result, the team has developed a solid understanding of electric propulsion for rotorcraft as a result of testing the following components:

The eight electric motors with silicon-carbide (SiC) inverters

Liquid cooling integration

Individual propeller control integrated with vehicle flight controls

CityAirbus has conducted its first fully automatic flight.

In the months (and years) to come, the ZEROe pre-programme is expected to take centre stage at E-Aircraft Systems. This means E-Aircraft Systems is poised to play a key role in helping to define the propulsion technologies that will power Airbus’ future zero-emission aircraft.

The ZEROe concept aircraft feature three configurations (turbofan, turboprop and blended wing body) that are all powered by hybrid-hydrogen technology.

World-class testing capabilities in Europe

To date, all alternative-propulsion units and systems tested at E-Aircraft Systems have been attached to Airbus projects. But that will soon change.

Zeleros, the European start-up developing a scalable hyperloop system for ultra-fast city-to-city travel, recently confirmed that it will entrust E-Aircraft Systems to support the development of its vehicle propulsion system. The system is based on zero-emission and energy-efficient technology, including a fully electric powertrain.

“At E-Aircraft Systems, we can offer world-class testing for multiple components and architectures related to electric-propulsion systems,” Benjamin says. “This is evidenced by our hands-on experience with key Airbus electrification projects. We’re looking forward to applying our know-how in alternative propulsion to help companies like Zeleros accelerate their development timelines, while at the same time, paving the way towards a more sustainable mobility future.”"
Urban air mobility... from the ground up - Airbus,"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIxLTAzLXVyYmFuLWFpci1tb2JpbGl0eS1mcm9tLXRoZS1ncm91bmQtdXDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Four members of Airbus’ UAM department talk about the projects they’re working on, what got them interested in urban air mobility, and how it might change the skies for future generations.

Mona Moren, Avionics Systems Engineer for CityAirbus Demonstrator, Airbus Helicopters

“I always had a natural curiosity for anything related to science and engineering. After getting my masters I decided to start working in aeronautics—a fun, challenging industry. You see what it does for you in daily life, and I wanted to be a part of that.

On the CityAirbus demonstrator, I’ve worked on the avionics systems architectures onboard and in the ground control station, where the pilot commands the aircraft. This involved diverse activities, from design to operations support, following through with iterations as needed. Getting to flight was a team effort: it took every member’s involvement, specialties, collaboration and dedication.

The difference between UAM today and the classic aeronautics industry is that the product did not exist three years ago. When I joined the team, the demonstrator was just two structural beams connected together—that was the vehicle. The CityAirbus team is small and dynamic. We worked like a fast start-up with simplified processes and leaner ways of working. The timelines are shorter, and one of the goals is to learn as much as possible about the design dreamed up just a few years ago.

You also see first-hand how each detail has its importance. Every team contributor did what was needed, and everything found its place—now we have a demonstrator that we’ve built and tested in record time, and flown in a few locations.

The most exciting part of working in UAM is being part of the exploration of a modern-day frontier. It involves working with experienced people who are passionate, dedicated, collaborative and excited about trying new things—all while keeping people safe.”

Dr. Markus May, Managing Director Airbus Urban Mobility GmbH

“When the UAM organisation was created three years ago, my manager asked if I wanted to join this journey. I liked the idea of opening up the sky in urban areas and bringing zero-emission vertical mobility into our cities.

“I’ve had the chance to found two companies in the past. So, I saw it as a nice challenge to build a modern legal entity for UAM in the form of a corporate start-up. We started off by identifying the basic principles, we built a team and defined the culture together so that we could set up lean processes and state-of-the-art tools, while ramping up and working on the content in parallel.

“From a vehicle perspective we deliberately chose two different configurations for technology demonstration. On the one hand, Vahana as a singlepassenger vehicle with a tilt-wing configuration that is capable of flying 20 minutes with a 50 km range. On the other hand, CityAirbus was designed for four passengers and with the objective to test the electric propulsion system for this weight category. Distributed electric propulsion is completely opening up the conventional design space and there is a variety of vehicle configurations out there at this stage. And we know that autonomy will be a key enabler for a commercially viable transport service in the future.

“All in all, we’re really at the spearhead of innovation and it feels exciting to be part of this revolution in aviation, and more generally in mobility. Aspects like sustainability and public acceptance become more and more important in our daily lives. And it is a great adventure to paint the picture of how we integrate this new type of vertical mobility in our cities.”

Romain Legast, Head of Procurement at Airbus Urban Air Mobility

“In 2018, I was selected to lead the procurement and supply chain for Airbus Urban Mobility U.S. for the Vahana demonstrator. Since June 2020, I’ve been in charge of managing the supply chain for UAM developments by all Airbus entities.

“What I find fascinating is we are creating a new type of industry. Upcoming generations expect immediate solutions on demand, but they also want to live in a more sustainable world. Inside Airbus, we can be part of this adventure.

“It’s really exciting to work on an electric aircraft. The decarbonisation of the industry is important, for me personally, but for the public in general. It would be a profound success if the aeronautics industry could become decarbonised. What’s also exciting is we are challenged by new competitors, which helps us to be more agile and define ways of working so that we’re in a position to move at the same speed as these new companies. Having worked in Acubed* helped a lot! During my years there I learned how to manage risk when taking a decision – it may not always be the best one but it allows you to be fast.

“Since new generations are changing how they live, UAM ultimately allows people to redefine cities and the way we operate them.”

* Acubed, Airbus’ innovation lab based in Silicon Valley

Jose Carlos Ramos Fernandez, Program & Strategy at Airbus Urban Mobility GmbH

“I came to UAM because I wanted to be part of the next transformation of flight. The people in UAM are a diverse team who share a passion to create the future of aviation.

“I’m setting up the project management office for the CityAirbus vehicle. One of my jobs is analysing how to streamline project management. Airbus has processes to develop and certify an aircraft or helicopter. We want to benefit from processes already in place and adapt them with new and more agile ways of working to improve efficiency across projects and teams.

“While the core of UAM is the vehicle development, we also have colleagues working on influencing its public acceptance, others who work with city projects, or are working in airspace management and regulations. We will not develop the entire infrastructure, but we will need to make sure this vehicle is integrated in this ecosystem.

“It is exciting to be part of the creation of a future transport and contribute to smarter and more sustainable cities. This is one of my motivations as an engineer. It’s a dynamic environment – so we need to be fast enough to react. You don’t only develop your resilience in this area, but also your antifragility: get better, thrive as result of volatility. Approaching such a challenge requires people who share the spirit of developing a project in an uncertain environment.”"

Helicopters battle the blaze - Airbus,"Wed, 03 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIxLTAzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLWJhdHRsZS10aGUtYmxhemXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Uncontrolled fires have become a distressing annual occurrence in recent years. The link between climate change and the increasing severity of wildfires is so well documented that few deny its existence. Firefighting, traditionally considered to be just one of the many aerial roles of helicopters, is now becoming one of their most critical tasks, especially in summer.

“Unprecedented”

Wildfires are increasingly becoming larger, faster, and more difficult to control. Climate change is one reason for this. The hotter global temperatures have created drier conditions, sapping vegetation’s moisture. The depopulation of rural environments and the shift away from mountain living, as well as human actions, are some of the factors that make the new generation of fires more difficult to control.

Attacking on all fronts

An Airbus-built rotorcraft operated by Mont Blanc Helicoptères supports firefighting efforts, complementing ground crews.

Country by country, the resources and response to fires vary. Fighting wildfires is a seasonal business that on average takes no more than three months; many countries’ aerial fleets are multi-purpose, flying other missions during the offseason. Subcontracting is another answer: to deal with unprecedented events, many national or state firefighting agencies call on a list of private operators specialised in firefighting. Increasingly, agencies are investing in dedicated firefighting resources, as in the case of the Tokyo fire department, which operates an H225 primarily for urban firefighting.

An actor today and in the future

Whether those aircraft are fully dedicated to fighting blazes or are seasonal, the market is in full swing. Firefighting makes up the second-largest segment (after law enforcement) in Airbus Helicopters’ global public services fleet, which includes around 4,950 units in flight, of which firefighting counts for 14% of the market.*

An Airbus-produced H125 helicopter deploys a bucket-type water dispersal system to support firefighting efforts.

What are a helicopter’s missions during firefighting?

Denis Bargès, Head of the Bouches-du-Rhône fire service’s Forest Fire Group Doctrine and Flight Service, explains the different types of helicopter interventions in the event of a fire:

“When a fire breaks out, helicopters offer the best way to reach the scene very quickly. Therefore, this is the solution that we look to first. During such an intervention, water bomber helicopters equipped with a supple bucket called a ‘Bambi Bucket’ or a Simplex kit, will contain the fire and slow down its progress by dropping an average of about 800 litres of water each time the helicopter flies over the fire (about 800 litres for an H125, 1,200 for an H145, and up to 4,000 for an H215). The helicopter’s main advantage compared to a plane is that it can drop water every two or three minutes if there is a water source nearby. If the fire is contained, the helicopter hands over to the fire trucks so that the ground personnel can finish extinguishing the fire.”

Kuwait’s Ministry of the Interior uses Airbus-produced H225 helicopters for firefighting missions.

“However, if the fire becomes too large, the water bomber helicopters are replaced by planes that can easily drop 6,000 litres of water each time they fly over the site. In parallel, the second mission – coordination – starts for helicopters deployed in firefighting. Personnel, vehicles on the ground, helicopters and planes all have to be coordinated. Ensuring that all these resources are used without interfering with each other is the work of the onboard air officer transported by the helicopter.”

In firefighting operations, the Helicopter Transport Intervention Detachment involves carrying equipment, personnel, or water that will be emptied into reservoirs for the teams on the ground.

“The helicopter’s third key mission in firefighting is known as the Helicopter Transport Intervention Detachment. This involves carrying equipment, personnel, or water that will be emptied into the 3,000-litre reservoirs provided for the teams on the ground. This type of flight also is very technical owing to the risk of collision with trees or obstacles on the ground and the difficulty in avoiding smoke. All this explains the very close relations between the firefighters and helicopter pilots (to whom we rent aircraft on average two or three months a year and who we know well). It is precisely the skill of one such pilot that saved my life a few years ago when the Bambi got stuck on the side of the water basin and the helicopter started to nose up as we took off. In order to be able to deal with any situation aboard a helicopter, we spend most of the winter months training and we work in the forests to prepare for the coming season by installing water sources so as to secure the area. Water sources every two kilometres guarantee a bombing rate of every two to three minutes.”

A321XLR demonstrator testing teams fine tune production maturity across the sites - Airbus,"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIxLTAzLWEzMjF4bHItZGVtb25zdHJhdG9yLXRlc3RpbmctdGVhbXMtZmluZS10dW5lLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tbWF0dXJpdHktYWNyb3Nz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The assets for the first A321XLR are being built and the major component production lines are taking shape across the various sites in the UK, Germany and France. Many components and parts are now in the final test phase to de-risk the route to flight clearance and serial manufacturing. ​​​​​​Key to achieving this are various demonstrators, which together play a major role to validate all the design work, assembly processes and ensuring that the parts are fully prepared for manufacturing.

​These full-size demonstrators are also being used to pre-train production-line staff at the final assembly facility in Hamburg where the first A321XLR will be built. Overall, this phase is supported by many people, with demonstrators and physical mock-ups in various sites, with the teams working transversally in collaboration.

Overview of mockups & demonstrators

Gary O’Donnell, Head of the A321XLR programme brings us up-to-speed on how the demonstrators are helping the teams across the Airbus sites and their supply chains to develop an early maturity for design, production, training and maintenance: “For some time already we have been using a rich mixture of 3D digital data, which includes virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), to demonstrate the 3D digital model. We have also been using early physical demonstrators, which could be wooden mockups like those in Hamburg, or 3D printed parts. More recently we come to the full-scale production demonstrators which we see more and more of today – primarily focusing around Saint Nazaire and Hamburg.”

O’Donnell continues: “Why do we use them? I see three steps: The early physical demonstrators and the virtual demonstrators enable us to validate our design decisions and close these topics. Most of that was completed in 2020. Then we have the second stage: the full-scale production standard demonstrators which primarily support the training and the industrial process maturity, and they help secure our ramp-up, as we run them ‘at rate’. This is happening across the assembly areas – Saint Nazaire, Hamburg, and also in Broughton. Likewise for the new water/waste tank, landing gears and brakes.”

“Then for the third level we are running demonstrators for maintenance, repair and customer support teams, in order that they can use the demonstrators to create the airline documents, the technical documents and repair manuals,” explains O’Donnell. “There is a mixture here of physical demonstrators with VR and AR to allow the teams to really test how they can change and fix parts in the operations system – whether in a hangar or on the apron, so that when they are writing the repair manuals or the technical documents they have been able to check on these virtual references to make the process easier.”

Focus on Centre & Aft Fuselage (CAF) and Nose & Forward Fuselage (NFF) sections

As the major component assembly (MCA) phase of the first A321XLR flight-test aircraft draws closer, the focus at the time of writing – in terms of demonstrators – is naturally on two large fuselage structures and systems demonstrators located in Hamburg, Germany and in Saint Nazaire, France. Respectively, these Physical Mock-ups (PMUs) are the “Pre-Industrial System Accelerator” (PISA) for the Centre & Aft Fuselage (CAF) section, and the Nose & Forward Fuselage (NFF) section.

Martin Schnoor, A321XLR Airframe Leader explains: “In the PMU demonstrator for the forward section we are focused on the XLR’s structure reinforcement due to the different loads, and also on the new systems improvement for cabin comfort. The PMU gives us the opportunity to bring all modifications together from Airframe, Systems and Cabin to confirm the industrial interfaces.”

“Meanwhile the PMU in Hamburg is focusing on the XLR’s major components including the rear-centre-tank (RCT) integration; water tank integration; the extended fuel system and the modified hydraulic system. Here, we take full advantage of the proximity of the rear fuselage PMU to the Final Assembly Line (FAL) to provide production operator training before they go into the first serial produced aircraft,” says Schnoor.

He points out that these demonstrators are not just a one-off exercise. “We will keep these PMU demonstrators ‘on stage’ not only during the XLR’s introduction, but also to be continually updated over the longer term, such as for future modifications and heads-of-versions “HoVs”, as well for shop-floor training.”

Hauke Delmas, Head of Single Aisle XLR Equipping in Hangar 259 concurs: “All these demonstrators help us to observe the systems, activities, workflows and premises under holistic real conditions at an early stage before start of production. The demonstrators, along with classroom training and VR/AR training, will be an integral part of our employee training and onboarding in the future. They provide a protected space for learning and further development. It is thus possible to learn from mistakes on the mock-ups without endangering production or safety. Of course, it also makes sense from a business point of view to decouple ongoing production from design changes, modifications, new installations and the training of new employees.”

Demonstrator case studies

Pre-Industrial System Accelerator “PISA"" – for A321XLR Centre & Aft Fuselage (CAF)

In August 2020 the A321XLR programme management took the opportunity to use an available A321LR fuselage specimen MSN8531, which was previously used to mature the Airspace Cabin before entry into the FAL, and transform it into a “Pre-Industrial System Accelerator”, known as “PISA”, to serve as the systems integration platform for A321XLR.

“The PISA demonstrator offers a hybrid configuration: The main-deck is applicable to both the A321LR (“Standard-008”) fuselage and A321XLR (“Standard-009”) – primarily for the Airspace cabin elements – while in parallel, the lower-deck is being configured to specifically represent the A321XLR’s structures and systems,” explains Frank Dohrmann Head of XLR Demonstrators, who leads the PISA project. “The demonstrator will also facilitate repetitive blue-collar training sessions to ensure the manufacturing process of the flight-test aircraft and subsequent ramp-up of the customer Heads-of-Versions (HoVs).”

Located in hangar 10 in Hamburg, a ‘Standard-008’ A321 CAF section was pulled out of production. This section was already fully equipped, so once the teams have removed all the systems they can subsequently install the new systems into the lower-deck, so as to conform to the -XLR’s ‘Standard-009’ configuration. The upgrade of this section to the full-scale -XLR PISA is now being performed time-wise and area-wise as an integral approach to most efficiently combine the Main Landing Gear Bay and the Belly Fairing changes as ‘Step 1’ – as well as systems installation. Subsequently the remaining areas for ‘Step 2’ and include the RCT area – specifically the orbital joint C35 in Section 17 – plus the new waste-water tank involving Section 17/18, as well as the ‘e-rudder’ systems. In short, the PISA demonstrator embodies the end-to-end process from design changes to industrialization of the A321XLR. Moreover, it is not just for the ramp-up of the -XLR, but also for future adaptations and major mods.

Physical Mock-Up “PMU”– for A321XLR Nose & Forward Fuselage (NFF)

Meanwhile, over in Saint Nazaire, the Physical Mock-Up “PMU” is taking shape in its own dedicated station in the recently commissioned Industrial Maturity Center. As with the PISA mockup (described above), this demonstrator is also based on a real pre-made A321 fuselage section from the production line – in this case MSN9893.

Denis Abraham, in Single Aisle VSM Programme Management, explains the overall rationale of the PMU: “The project enables the development and industrial implementation of Single-Aisle evolutions to be as secure as possible. These evolution changes will therefore first be integrated into this mockup, making it possible to identify risks and potential disruptions and make the necessary modifications to optimize integration on the production lines. This preliminary work will also help to achieve the quality objectives more easily. At the same time, it will also be used for training companions on XLR and DDMS projects.”

Abraham points out that even though it is not yet fully upgraded to -XLR configuration, the PMU is already proving value with its use for the first trial installation and integration of a new main instrument panel (MIP) structure which will become standard on for all the A320 Family and is a prerequisite for the -XLR. “The pre-FAL operators in Saint Nazaire are now able to understand this new MIP structure in real factory conditions with the installation and ergonomics validation on the PMU. Furthermore, this new test in the final production environment has proven to be essential for optimizing the logistics flow and the placement of tooling on the line, in advance of actual production,” he adds.

Another example of important demonstrator activity is taking place in the “Operability Virtual Reality Room” in Toulouse. This allows the teams to test the maintenance of new designs implemented on A321XLR.

Thomas Candela, Airbus Operations’ Virtual Reality expert, explains: “By mixing virtual means – such as virtual reality (VR) masks & trackers for full body tracking, leap motion for hand tracking, augmented reality (AR) masks, 3D printed parts – concurrently with physical mock-ups, we are proposing more and more realistic environments to test the accessibility, tools positioning and equipment removal paths. It therefore offers the opportunity to check associated documentation, propose design evolutions and reduce the number of tests needed on the actual aircraft.”"
Airbus pioneers first satellite factory in space - Airbus,"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0wMy1haXJidXMtcGlvbmVlcnMtZmlyc3Qtc2F0ZWxsaXRlLWZhY3RvcnktaW4tc3BhY2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PERIOD consortium to prepare concept for in-orbit demonstrator

In-space antenna and satellite assembly: first steps towards space manufacturing

Bremen, 11 March 2021 - Airbus has been selected by the European Commission to study spacecraft manufacturing in space through the Horizon 2020 Programme. The PERIOD (PERASPERA In-Orbit Demonstration) project focuses on satellite assembly and manufacturing in orbit. This A/B1 phase study contract, worth € 3 million, will last two years, with the objective to continue with a demonstrator in orbit.

The “orbital factory” envisioned by PERIOD will pioneer construction of major components such as antenna reflectors, assembly of spacecraft components and satellite payload replacements, directly in space.

This is the precursor to future manufacturing of large structures in orbit. Producing directly in orbit will revolutionise the way space systems are designed, built and operated. It has significant advantages over the traditional approach – where everything is produced on Earth and subsequently transported to space – since objects made in space are freed from the constraints and requirements of launch (launcher mass and volume limitations, structural strength to withstand launch).

To achieve this goal, Airbus Defence and Space in Bremen, is leading a team of seven European innovators, bringing their own expertise in fields such as robotic operation, virtual reality, and in-space assembly: DFKI, EASN-TIS, GMV, GMV-SKY, ISISPACE, SENER Aeroespacial and Space Applications Services.

By validating disruptive capabilities, PERIOD will demonstrate the value of in space servicing, manufacturing and assembly. It will also help Europe develop capability and industrial infrastructure to put it at the leading edge of the in-orbit servicing and manufacturing market. PERIOD will stimulate future research and generate new market opportunities, leading to jobs and growth in forward-looking technology.

The future space factory, as well as the demonstrator, could be orbited by a launcher and would then activate and start producing in orbit as a free flyer. An alternative demonstration mission, offering more flexibility and for a lower cost, would be to use ISS infrastructure.

“Airbus has been working on in-orbit manufacturing technologies for more than a decade and the PERIOD programme will help Europe move its combined technological know-how to the next level,” said Silvio Sandrone, head of Space Exploration future projects at Airbus. “Future large scale space systems can only be manufactured and assembled in orbit, so it’s crucial that Europe is at the forefront of this key capability.”

Airbus teams are already involved in a number of other in-space research programmes including Metal3D, the first ever metal 3D printer due to be deployed to space next year, in a project funded by the European Space Agency (ESA), and the MANTOS project, which demonstrated robotic and AI-based assembly operations with the support of German Space Agency (DLR).

The aircraft landed back at Toulouse’s Blagnac airport at 2:22 p.m. local time on Sept. 25 after 2-hr. and 22-min. During the flight, the aircraft stayed near Toulouse and started opening the flight envelope at a medium speed and altitude range initially. The aircraft was flown by Philippe Pellerin and Etienne Miche de Malleray, both experimental test pilots. Airbus will use eight new-engine-option aircraft for the flight-test campaign: four A320s, two A319s and two A32Is.

With few modifications made to the aircraft itself, Airbus’s main challenge beyond the flight tests was to succeed with an unprecedented ramp-up of NEO production, from zero to 46 aircraft per month within three years. The transition from the current A320 version to the NEO was to be completed in 2018.

Airbus nets first commercial GEO order of 2021 with Eutelsat replacement satellite - SpaceNews,"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9ldXRlbHNhdC1vcmRlcnMtcmVwbGFjZW1lbnQtZ2VvLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS1ldXRlbHNhdC0zNmQtZnJvbS1haXJidXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This story was updated March 22 with comments from Eutelsat and Airbus.

TAMPA, Fla. — Eutelsat Communications has ordered a geostationary (GEO) satellite called Eutelsat 36D from Airbus for a launch in 2024.

The contract marks the first commercial GEO signed order of 2021, according to an Airbus Defence and Space spokesperson.

Eutelsat 36D will replace Eutelsat 36B long before it reaches the end of its life in 2026 at the 36° East orbital position, where the satellite provides TV broadcast and government services across Africa, Russia and Europe.

The new satellite will launch in the second half of 2024. It will take between five to six months to enter service because it is using all-electric propulsion.

Eutelsat spokesperson Marie-Sophie Ecuer said it is creating headroom between Eutelsat 36D’s availability and Eutelsat 36B’s expiration to guard against launch failures, or other potential disruptions, because of how critical 36° East is for the company.

It is Eutelsat’s third most crucial orbital position in terms of broadcast revenue, and second for government services. Eutelsat 36C is also providing services from 36° East.

[spacenews-ad]

“We are delighted to rely once again on one of our longstanding partners, Airbus, to assure this critical satellite program,” said Pascal Homsy, Eutelsat’s chief technical officer.

“This new state-of-the-art satellite will assure enhanced service continuity for our key DTH customers in the major markets of Africa and Russia.”

Eutelsat 36D will have 70 physical Ku-band transponders, 18 kW of power and is based on the Airbus Eurostar Neo platform.

It is one of six satellites that Eutelsat has ordered for launches between 2021 and 2024.

Airbus order spree

Eutelsat 36D is the 26th satellite that Eutelsat has ordered overall from Airbus, which has built four of the all-electric satellites currently in orbit. The European manufacturer said it has 17 additional all-electric, high-capacity telecoms satellites under construction.

Intelsat signed a contract with Airbus at the end of 2020 for two satellites, announced in early 2021.

Airbus expects 15-18 GEO orders will be made this year as the commercial market slowly recovers from years of sluggish demand.

A series of commercial GEO communications satellites ordered in 2020, to help operators clear C-band spectrum for cellular 5G networks, provided a major —albeit temporary — boost for the market.

“The covid pandemic has shown the need for reliable, resilient and universal connectivity so we think the structural fundamentals for a return to growth are there and solid,” the Airbus Defence and Space spokesperson said.

Airbus expects around 70% of the future orders will be replacement satellites like Eutelsat 36D, addressing similar missions but with potentially different technology.

“We are at a moment where operators had to push their satellites to the limits of their lifetimes and have now to replace their assets with the new technologies and price points we can offer to adapt to their current and future business,” the spokesperson added."

Created by Airbus Commercial and powered by Maana, AIRKOG encodes the subject matter expertise of people, orchestrates a range of tools, and uses terabytes of data from multiple sources for the development and deployment of intelligent applications to answer critical technical questions on A320, A330 and A350 aircraft models.

“As a transformational platform, AIRKOG is helping us to drive improvements at Airbus Commercial,” said Florent Bouix, AIRKOG Platform Manager for Big Data products service line at Airbus. “We provide solutions to thousands of employees with an increasing number of intelligent applications in engineering, procurement, logistics, quality, program management, as well as rapid analysis for plant and final assembly line improvements.”

Using AIRKOG platform capabilities, Airbus consolidates data from tens of different systems; identifies and establishes a vast number of relations and correlations, implement computations and run analysis across multiple operational domains; all on a single platform.

“Thanks to AIRKOG, we achieved multi-million Euro cost savings per year at various areas,” Mr. Bouix stated “for example:

Managing complex process related to new parts introduction due to aircraft changes for new Head of Version (involving engineering, sourcing, ordering, and manufacturing),

Supporting the margin reviews or costs reduction of some aircraft options,

Mastering electrical harnesses configuration changes and reallocation by providing multivariate analysis to avoid scrapping in a complex manufacturing organization with multiple plants.”

AIRKOG started in 2017 as a proof of concept for use of knowledge graph technology to reduce time spent by Airbus engineers and technicians searching for information. AIRKOG moved to pilot phase in 2018, and into production in 2019. After two years running in production at scale, Airbus Commercial and Maana extended their partnership for another three years for 2021-2023.

“AIRKOG is an intelligent platform, like its consumer-facing cousins Siri and Alexa,” said Babur Ozden, Founder and CEO of Maana. “However, it answers far more difficult questions regarding many complex aspects of making, maintaining, and repairing aircraft.”

“Thanks to AIRKOG platform and the computational knowledge graph at its core, we reduced costs by 20% - 30% and lead-time for analysis by 30% - 75% on our digitalization platform” said Marc Monties, WideBody digitalization plateau leader at Airbus.

A new phase begins at Airbus Foundation - Airbus,"Wed, 03 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIxLTAzLWEtbmV3LXBoYXNlLWJlZ2lucy1hdC1haXJidXMtZm91bmRhdGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This year, the Airbus Foundation is embarking on a new phase in its evolution, a journey that began nearly two decades ago in 2008. Julie Kitcher, Airbus EVP Communications and Corporate Affairs and newly appointed Airbus Foundation Board Chair, describes the new vision, as well as how it ties into Airbus’ overall purpose.

5 questions with Julie Kitcher, Airbus Foundation Board Chair

Q. You were recently named the Airbus Foundation Board Chair. What does your role entail?

My role is to help drive the Foundation’s mission forward. This includes making sure we’re reinforcing our commitments to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as well as ensuring we have the framework in place to encourage an employee-centric approach designed to support local initiatives.



Q. What is the vision behind this new phase at Airbus Foundation?

We're not reinventing the wheel. Our goal is to continue to build on the incredible work—consisting of showcasing how Airbus people, products and business know-how can be a force for societal good—already done by the Foundation. At the same time, we want to incite a “grassroots” approach to enable the Foundation to become more “employee-centric,” facilitating volunteering and fundraising for all employees.

I believe there’s no greater catalyst for change than the power of a collective movement. Through the Airbus Foundation, we have tremendous potential to continue to foster inclusivity and education, while helping address the broader challenges within our communities.

- Julie Kitcher, Chair of the Airbus Foundation Board

Q. Can you explain these three pillars in more detail?

We’re refocusing the Foundation’s mission around the following three core pillars for corporate and employee activities:

Humanitarian : Emergency response will continue to be our main focus. This involves providing corporate support through our products and services for key “first responder” partners in the form of humanitarian relief flights, satellite imagery, and more.

Education : Promoting STEM topics to youth remains a key priority. But we’ll now focus on leveraging our “Discovery Space” digital platform to share engaging and innovative digital resources designed to inspire young people to get excited about STEM topics.

Environment: Given the increasing global challenge of climate change, the environment has become a new key pillar. Our efforts will focus on contributing to the climate strategies of our current partners, developing unique partnerships with environmental institutions and/or NGOs, and supporting a wider scope of employee-led environment initiatives within our communities.



Q. How is the current context reflected in the Foundation’s work?

We’re in the midst of an unprecedented health, economic and social crisis, which is creating historic levels of disparities. Nurturing partnerships with volunteer associations and international aid organisations, as well as increasing access to quality education opportunities and essential services through the Airbus Foundation will therefore be even more vital.

I’d also like to note that Airbus’ long-term commitment to society has never been more apparent than during the height of the COVID-19 crisis.

Key initiatives, so far, have included:

funding humanitarian flights between China and Europe to transport millions of masks for public distribution

working in partnership with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Aviation sans Frontières and other NGOs to provide medical and education equipment around the world

launching the “Discover at Home” campaign, which promoted digital STEM content for children studying at home during the lockdown period

supporting innovation projects and employee initiatives through the Humanity Lab @ ProtoSpace.

Furthermore, the Foundation’s new roadmap includes establishing an advisory council to draw in additional support and provide expert advice and strategic direction on how we can best help the recovery from COVID-19.



Q. How does the Foundation support Airbus’ overall purpose?

The Foundation is a great example of how we use our products, services and business know-how as a force for good. For me, this goes hand-in-hand with our purpose of pioneering sustainable aerospace for a safe and united world. I also believe there’s no greater catalyst for change than the power of a collective movement. Through the Airbus Foundation, we have tremendous potential to continue to foster inclusivity and education, while helping address the broader challenges within our communities.

Airbus wins its first Syracuse IV ground segment programme contract - Airbus,"Thu, 04 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0wMy1haXJidXMtd2lucy1pdHMtZmlyc3Qtc3lyYWN1c2UtaXYtZ3JvdW5kLXNlZ21lbnQtcHJvZ3JhbW1lLWNvbnRyYWN00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris, 4 March 2020 – Within the Syracuse IV programme, Airbus has been awarded a 10-year framework agreement called Copernicus for the construction and upgrading of part of the ground segment for the telecommunications satellites used by the French Armed Forces. As part of Copernicus, the French Directorate General of Armaments (DGA) has placed an initial order worth more than € 100 million.

Dominique Maudet, Head of French Defence Sales at Airbus Defence and Space said: “We are building the future broadband and multi-satellite ground segment for France’s Armed Forces. It will be fully integrated, intelligent and dynamic, giving operators access to a decision-making tool unique to satellite communications management.”

This first order specifically covers the development of the future satellite communications management system for the French Ministry of Defence. This unique portal called Pegasus, accessible to all units, will enable the French Armed Forces to optimise use of the available capacities on military and commercial satellites. It will make it possible to coordinate requests entered by central military staff or any unit deployed on the ground, at sea or in the air. Allocation of satellite capacities will be optimised in terms of operational criteria completed by the units, such as the type of terminals used, ground cover, level of cyber security, jamming resistance, as well as the need for availability.

The Copernicus project also aims to increase the operability of Comcept, the multi-satellite communications network designed by Airbus and commissioned by the French armed forces in 2017. Comcept uses the broadband Ka-band transmission capacities of the Franco-Italian military satellite ATHENA-FINDUS, in addition to the Ku- and C-band capacities of commercial satellites. Thanks to these developments, Comcept will also be able to use the high-speed Ka-band of future satellites SYRACUSE 4A and 4B.

Different elements of the SYRACUSE IV programme’s future ground segment and the Pegasus portal will enable the French armed forces to use the entire spectrum of satellite capacities efficiently and dynamically, from the most secure and resilient to the high-speed and wide coverage capacities, in all areas of operations.

Largest study yet of 100% biofuel-use for airliners starts at Airbus - Aerospace Testing International,"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZXJvc3BhY2V0ZXN0aW5naW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC5jb20vbmV3cy9lbmdpbmUtdGVzdGluZy9sYXJnZXN0LXN0dWR5LXlldC1vZi0xMDAtYmlvZnVlbC11c2UtZm9yLWxhcmdlLWFpcmxpbmVycy1zdGFydHMtYXQtYWlyYnVzLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus, Rolls-Royce, Neste and DLR are to conduct one of the largest trials yet of fuelling large commercial airliners with a 100% biofuel blend.

The Emission and Climate Impact of Alternative Fuels (ECLIF3) project will be the world’s first study of the in-flight emissions produced by a wide-body commercial passenger aircraft running off 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Under global rules overseen by the body ASTM International, the current maximum blend ratio of biofuels and conventional jet fuel that can be used in aircraft is a 50/50 one.

The SAF will be produced with HEFA (hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids) technology and provided by Finnish biofuel company Neste.

DLR has already tested SAF produced by HEFA technology at various blends on the ground and during flight using the Airbus A320 ATRA (Advanced Technology Research Aircraft) in 2015 and in 2018 with NASA.

Boeing’s annual ecoDemonstrator test program has also tested various biofuel blends on commercial passenger airliners. Last year a 50/50 mix was flown on a 787 between Seattle and North Charleston in the USA.

The ECLIF3 study, which is also examining the effects of SAF on aircraft performance, will consist of a series of ground and flight tests using an Airbus A350-900 aircraft powered by Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines this year.

The first engine tests for the project, including a first flight to check operational compatibility of using 100% SAF with the aircraft’s systems, was done at Airbus’ testing facilities in Toulouse, France, earlier this week.

The flight-emissions tests are planned to be conducted in April and Autumn this year. During the flight tests DLR’s Falcon 20-E chase plane will carry out measurements to investigate the emissions impact of using SAF.

At the same time ground tests that measure particulate-matter emissions will indicate the environmental impact of using SAF on airport operations. The results of the tests will be compared against the emissions from fossil kerosene and low-sulphur fossil kerosene.

Additional measurement and analysis for the characterisation of the particulate-matter emissions during the ground testing will be delivered by the UK’s University of Manchester and the National Research Council of Canada.

Steven Le Moing, new energy programme manager for Airbus said, “Aircraft can currently only operate using a maximum 50% blend of SAF and fossil kerosene. This collaboration will not only provide insight into how gas-turbine engines function using 100% SAF with a view to certification, but identify the potential emissions reductions and environmental benefits of using such fuels in flight on a commercial aircraft too.”

Dr Patrick Le Clercq, ECLIF project manager at DLR said, “By investigating 100% SAF, we are taking our research on fuel design and aviation climate impact to a new level. In previous research campaigns, we were already able to demonstrate the soot-reduction potential of between 30 and 50% blends of alternative fuels, and we hope this new campaign will show that this potential is now even greater.”"

The team at THC used their fleet of Airbus-built H125s to ensure safety and reliability in the desert terrain.

The Dakar Rally is not for the feeble hearted. A gruelling two-week race, the rally is known for its long circuit – covering some several thousand kilometres in total – and through off-road conditions that put each driver’s skill to the test. The 2021 race circled almost the entirety of Saudi Arabia, through deserts and sand dunes, skimming the shores of the Red Sea and finishing in Jeddah.

The H125 is a multi-task helicopter that can easily be reconfigured for various missions.

- Arnaud Martinez, CEO of The Helicopter Company

“Our fleet of H125s was selected because of its reliability. The H125 is a multi-task helicopter that can easily be reconfigured for various missions, therefore, is well suited for major sport events such as Dakar to cover the event’s needs from aerial work to emergency medical services (EMS) and private charters,” said Arnaud Martinez, the CEO of THC.

A race against the clock

“This year’s race was very close. The top competitors were not far from each other – two-to-three minutes apart – so it was going very fast,” said Gilles Plaisance, Director of Flight Operations at THC. “If one of the competitors was injured during the race, it was our job to get them to the hospital as fast as possible. It was a race against time for us.”

A team of four H125s, an ambulance and fixed-wing aircraft were at the ready throughout the race. THC was charged with the task of airlifting injured drivers from difficult-to-access terrain.

H125 rotorcraft operated by The Helicopter Company (THC) provided emergency medical services, VIP transport and aerial work at the 2021 Dakar Rally in Saudi Arabia.

The helicopters followed the race closely; flying 100 km every several hours to stay near the head of the race. In the event of an accident, the team was immediately contacted, allowing them to arrive on the scene within minutes. THC’s fleet was equipped with the necessary tools to extract the driver from the vehicle if needed, while the medical team on board provided emergency care. The patient was then transported to the nearest primary medical field where they could be flown via fixed-wing aircraft to the nearest hospital.

“It was very organised, and the crews were highly-experienced in air medical services,” said Plaisance, whose team carried out a total of 28 EMS missions during the rally.

VIP and aerial work

Alongside EMS operations, THC was responsible for VIP transportation: an H130 and H125 were light enough to land in any of the sandy dunes near the race circuit, allowing viewers to catch a glimpse of the heart of the action. When an accident occurred in an isolated area, once the driver was evacuated, it was a THC helicopter that airlifted the leftover vehicle back to the camp, clearing the path for other drivers.

Harsh desert environment

80% of the surface in Saudi Arabia is covered in sand, which causes particular challenges to aircraft. “You need a really strong helicopter to survive in desert conditions. The sand creates a difficult environment for the blades, the engine,” said Plaisance. “It has to be powerful, but also light enough to land on the soft dunes. With the H125, we could land anywhere.”

You need a really strong helicopter to survive in desert conditions…With the H125, we could land anywhere.

- Gilles Plaisance, Director of Flight Operations at THC

Another challenge to flying in desert conditions is understanding how high you are. “It’s like flying over snow – it’s very uniform and is hard to tell if you are high or low in altitude, which can cause a pilot to become disoriented,” said Plaisance. “All of our Airbus-built helicopters were equipped with radar-altitude devices. It’s incredibly helpful in sandy environments.”

The Helicopter Company (THC) utilised Airbus-produced H125s and H130s during the 2021 Dakar Rally in Saudi Arabia.

Coordination in the air

With several aircraft flying during the race, from VIP transportation, HEMS aircraft, to near-to-the-ground filming crews, coordination in the air was paramount. The Helicopter Company’s Airbus-built helicopters were equipped with Traffic Collision Avoidance Systems (TCAS). “Each pilot could see on their instrument panel in real-time where all of the other aircraft in the area were. It was a big improvement for safety, and works really well on the H125,” said Plaisance.

“This day is an ongoing journey reminding government, businesses and everyone else that society has come a long way,” said Susan Breton, Head of Inclusion & Diversity at Airbus. “In countries where women once could not vote, they can now lead such countries. While women once faced restrictions on where they worked, they are now running corporations. In many parts of the world, they have rights that their grandmothers could only have dreamed about. However, much remains to be done and progress is slow.”

Breton added that International Women's Day – observed today, 8 March – is the opportunity for everyone to renew their commitment, evaluate and push issues that are most relevant for the progress of women. She continued: “For me, every day is International Women's Day.”

A commitment to gender equality

Airbus has a strong commitment to making progress in promoting a more inclusive environment and enhancing gender diversity and inclusion.

Different initiatives have been put in place to support the development of women, including a “Balance for Business” platform that oversees various employee resource groups – all dedicated to promoting and raising awareness of inclusion and diversity topics from gender diversity and culture to disability. In addition, there are flexible working policies for parents/caregivers and recruitment strategies for new female talent.

For me, every day is International Women’s Day.

- Susan Breton, Head of Inclusion & Diversity at Airbus

Several official commitments also have been endorsed, including the United Nation’s seven Women’s Empowerment Principles – which are designed to empower women in the workplace, marketplace, and community.

Despite this, the gender balance evolution over the past five years has been slow, from 17.4% women in 2015 to 18.7% by the end of 2020 – making it even more important to celebrate the company’s female employees and the fantastic contribution they make. That’s why this International Women’s Day, Airbus is calling on everyone everywhere to make this day one that truly makes a positive difference for women."

Release Date March 17, 2021 The Airbus A330 is lost in the pandemic’s economic Twilight Zone Purchase a PDF of this analysis

The A330 is Airbus’s best-selling twin-aisle aircraft and sold in incredible numbers over the last decade ahead of a generation of all-new designs.

That has left a surplus of twin-aisle aircraft firmly in place before the pandemic hit, throwing the market into deep uncertainty as those aircraft were too cheap to sell, but too-expensive to part-out.

Parking the surplus A330s in anticipation of better times remains the least-bad alternative for owners and lessors.

2021 is not a good time to own a wide-body passenger aircraft. Even as traffic continues its slow return, it is the long-haul, international traveler that has yet to return – and the very passenger on which the wide-body aircraft most relies.

As the remaining passenger market temporarily shifts to a short-haul, domestic form of travel, the requirement for smaller narrow-body aircraft has proven to be more buoyant than their wide-body counterparts. This trend is both intuitive and apparent in the data, as outlined by TAC Analysis in late summer, 2020.

Yet, within the widebody segment there remains a diverse fleet of aircraft experiencing varying levels of impact. The mid-sized wide-body segment spanning approximately 250 to 350 seats necessitates a closer look as it grapples with an abundance of classic aircraft and a strong order book for a new generation. Alongside the comparatively recent introductions of the Boeing 787-8 and -9, as well as the Airbus A350-900 and A330-900neo, the mid-sized segment was home to an already robust fleet of aircraft, including the 777-200ER and most notably, the A330-200 and -300.

It is the latter of these aircraft, the classic A330 and its market potential where we focus our attention for this TAC Analysis amidst a clear twin-aisle aircraft recession. How is the aircraft faring in the new mid-pandemic/pre-recovery market, and what factors are at play which could define its ultimate value to airlines and lessors?"
Corsair takes delivery of its first A330neo - Airbus,"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0wMy1jb3JzYWlyLXRha2VzLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LW9mLWl0cy1maXJzdC1hMzMwbmVv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse, 31 March 2021 - Corsair has taken delivery of its first A330-900, on lease from Avolon, to join the French airline’s fleet.

By selecting a total of five A330neos, Corsair is executing its strategy to become an all-A330 operator. Thanks to the A330neo’s latest technologies, Corsair will benefit from cost-effective and eco-efficient solutions, while providing passengers with the best comfort standards in the quietest cabins in its class.



The aircraft features 352 seats in a three-class layout, providing all the comfort and amenities of Airbus’ leading ‘Airspace’ cabin, including state-of-the-art passenger in-flight entertainment (IFE) and full WiFi connectivity throughout the cabin.



The A330neo is powered by Rolls-Royce’s latest-generation Trent 7000 engines. The Corsair aircraft will also be the first A330neo to feature an increased maximum take-off weight of 251 tonnes. This capability will allow the airline to fly long-haul destinations up to 13,400 km (7,200nm) or benefit from ten tons more payload on board.



The A330neo is a new-generation aircraft and successor to the hugely popular A330ceo widebody family. As well as the new engine option, the aircraft benefits from a host of innovations, including aerodynamic improvements and new wings and winglets that together contribute to 25% fuel-burn and CO2 reductions.



Corsair, which already operates an Airbus fleet of five A330 Family aircraft, became a member of the Airbus Skywise ‘Open Data Platform’ in 2020, thus benefiting from several Skywise-based services, such as a real-time in-service fleet performance analysis capability (aircraft health monitoring), reliability analysis and predictive maintenance.

Opinion: Boeing’s Project Means Work For Airbus Strategists - Aviation Week,"Wed, 03 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L2FpcmNyYWZ0LXByb3B1bHNpb24vb3Bpbmlvbi1ib2VpbmdzLXByb2plY3QtbWVhbnMtd29yay1haXJidXMtc3RyYXRlZ2lzdHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Conventional wisdom had it that Boeing’s recent woes would keep it from being able to afford developing an all-new aircraft in the foreseeable future, even if it were strikingly necessary. But, as Aviation Week has reported, Boeing has begun talks with suppliers about a project built on its previous work for a new midmarket airplane, currently available technologies and an aggressive timetable (AW&ST Feb. 8-21, p. 12). This raises the very real prospect that the company may actually launch an aircraft in the not-too-distant future in spite of all the constraints.

It is worth looking at the long-term, strategic consequences of such a move—in other words, the game theory behind it. To start with the obvious: Boeing would not seriously pursue this if it did not deem it absolutely necessary to contain the already worrying loss of market share in the large-narrowbody segment, where the Airbus A321XLR is vastly outselling the 737-9 and 737-10. The project would also further lock in Boeing on its path toward continued use of current technologies in combination with sustainable aviation fuels, rather than the more radical approach Airbus is proposing. Boeing has to be convinced it can sell a conventional aircraft for many years as the industry pursues its environmental transformation.

Given what has transpired, Boeing appears to be planning an aircraft that is 10-20% larger than the A321XLR and has more range at 5,000 nm. In terms of range and size, it would be a modern replacement of the 757—production of which began in 1983 and ended in 2004 after 1,050 units had been built. With the proposed aircraft, Boeing is anticipating resumption of the trend toward fragmentation of long-haul routes, which accelerated before the novel coronavirus pandemic. This would come after a relatively brief refocus on hubs, as many airlines have retrenched from direct services during the crisis. Airbus has to have the same hopes for its A321XLR. Both can take comfort in the fact that those routes are not new: Continental Airlines famously deployed a large fleet of 757s on secondary North Atlantic markets when others focused on higher-demand routes and larger aircraft.

Significantly, and unlike the 757, Boeing’s new aircraft is almost certainly going to be a widebody.

Game theory states that strategic moves should be targeted against an opponent’s weak spot. Obviously, the A321XLR is one of Airbus’ greatest strengths in terms of sales and positioning. Whether a new conventional widebody can really be much more efficient than a stretched narrowbody with state-of-the-art engines remains to be seen. Airbus can also probably look at further upgrades in due course, should they be needed.

Airbus’ biggest weakness is the A330neo. The aircraft is conceptually very similar to the first iteration of the A350 that Airbus pitched in the mid-2000s, after Boeing launched the 787. The concept was dropped quickly after negative customer feedback, but several years later the idea of a relatively cheap upgrade of the A330 resurfaced and morphed into the A330neo.

The A330neo is not selling well for several reasons. Many young and very cheap A330s are in service—Airbus probably produced too many in the boom years. Airlines that want more capacity in that category therefore have a big pool of used aircraft available that compete with the A330neo. Blue-chip carriers, with the exception of Delta Air Lines, have never really been interested in the aircraft. Airbus tried to place it with Emirates as part of the A380 order termination talks, but the airline unsurprisingly preferred the A350. Airbus is currently building the A330neo at a rate of around two aircraft per month.

With widebody demand likely to remain low for longer, the prospects are poor. And when demand is likely to pick up again, around 2025, Boeing may well be in the market with a cheaper, slightly smaller—and probably more efficient—widebody that will target routes for which the A330neo is too big and also compete directly with it on some others.

In that scenario, Airbus would have to take a hard look again at the lower end of its widebody portfolio—just as it has to define its path toward more sustainable aircraft in the narrowbody segment, where it is pitching the introduction of a small hydrogen-powered aircraft by 2035. Assuming that will still be the plan a few years from now, how will it combine with modernizing larger narrowbodies, for which hydrogen is not an option yet, not to mention tackling the renewed emerging competition from Boeing in the widebody field?

Airbus is in a comfortable position right now vis-a-vis Boeing, mainly because of the A320neo family and the A350. The company can take its time to decide next steps. But sooner or later it could be forced to solve a rather complex puzzle that is complicated by the upcoming technology transition. Whatever Airbus does will have to work in the long term."

This plasma purifier is improving access to safe drinking water - Airbus,"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIxLTAzLXRoaXMtcGxhc21hLXB1cmlmaWVyLWlzLWltcHJvdmluZy1hY2Nlc3MtdG8tc2FmZS1kcmlua2luZy13YXRlctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"

More than two billion people worldwide still lack access to safe drinking water. Today, an innovative plasma water purification system—funded by the Airbus Foundation for deployment in schools in Kenya—is improving hygiene, health and access to education for vulnerable populations.

For many of us, access to safe, readily available drinking water at home is something we take for granted. However, an estimated 2.1 billion people worldwide—almost 30% of the global population—still lack this access.

Safe water, sanitation and hygiene are among the most basic requirements for human health, as the COVID-19 pandemic has shown. For this reason, the United Nations has made access to clean water and sanitation one of its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In fact, the UN aims to achieve universal access to safe water across the globe by 2030. To achieve this goal, a variety of solutions will need to be developed—and technology is expected to play a key role.

An innovative plasma water purification system is showing promise in this regard. Developed by inventor Alfredo Zolezzi at the Advanced Innovation Centre, the system has already delivered tangible results in Chile. Today, the Airbus Foundation—in partnership with the Kenya Red Cross Innovation Unit administered under the International Centre of Humanitarian Affairs—is supporting the deployment of this innovative technology to make a difference in the lives of vulnerable children in Kenya.

Children arriving at the Mukuru School in Mukuru, an informal settlement in Nairobi County, Kenya.

""We hope the impact generated in the Kenya pilot will inspire other corporations to follow Airbus’ lead by working to make change globally.""

Alfredo Zolezzi, water plasma purifier inventor

Plasma power for drinkable water

For water to be safe and drinkable, it must be free of viruses and bacteria. Zolezzi used this as the starting point for his technical inquiry. But how to eliminate impurities at the source?

He found the answer in plasma.

His purification system starts by transforming a continuous flow of contaminated water into a plasma state. Plasma is often referred to as the fourth state of matter, in addition to solids, liquids and gases. It is similar to a gas, but the atomic particles are positively charged rather than neutral. Once the water reaches a plasma state—thanks to a pressurised reaction chamber and electric current—oxidation, ionisation and reactive species eliminate the microbiological water content. The water elements are then recombined and condensed as drinkable water.

“According to our tests, the plasma procedure can eliminate over 99.9999% of bacteria, achieving an unprecedented efficacy,” Zolezzi explains. “In doing so, the system can deliver access to safe drinking water to those in need quickly and efficiently.”

So far, the system has been used in Chilean slums and rural schools to great success. However, the first version of the system has been costly to produce and difficult to transport. Recognising the plasma water purifier’s potential, Airbus collaborated with Zolezzi’s team via the Airbus China Innovation Centre to adapt a prototype that not only costs less but is also much smaller, providing a highly efficient distributed solution at the point of use.

“We hope the impact generated in the Kenya pilot will inspire other corporations to follow Airbus’ lead by working to make change globally,” Zolezzi says.

A plasma water purifier unit has been installed on the premises of the Gatoto Community Primary School in Mukuru, Nairobi County, Kenya.

Innovative solutions to tackle everyday challenges

Now that the plasma water purifier is easily transportable, the Airbus Foundation has teamed up with the Kenya Red Cross Innovation Unit and the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) department to deploy this solution in an effort to reduce water-borne diseases in Kenya. As part of the partnership, the Airbus Foundation is funding the installation of seven water purifiers.

Currently, three units have been deployed in the Mukuru, an informal settlement in Nairobi County. The units are housed on school premises to enable children to access safe and pure drinking water. The children can also bring water home for use outside of school hours. Four more units will be installed in schools by the Plasma World team as soon as the COVID-19 situation improves and they are able to travel to Kenya again.

The implementation programme includes installation, extensive community outreach and impact measurement. Although schools have been closed throughout 2020 as a result of COVID-19, children are able to access the premises to collect safe drinking water for their families. Gatoto Primary School was one of the first schools to have received the units. To date, the school is still operational with over 1,000 students enrolled.

“The plasma water purifiers have made an enormous impact on the health, dignity and quality of life of children living in our community,” says a school teacher at the Gatoto Community Primary School in Mukuru. “Not only does good hygiene improve health, it also supports greater access to education because the purifiers are placed in schools.”

For the Airbus Foundation, the initiative builds on its mission to support communities, particularly in the context of youth development. It also enables Airbus to demonstrate its commitment to taking an active role in “Partnerships for the Goals,” a global goal of the UN SDGs and a framework on which Airbus bases its sustainability contributions.

“Innovation is essential, but innovation with purpose can be world-changing,” explains Rachel Schroeder, Airbus Foundation Managing Director. “We’re very happy if the plasma water purifiers can make such a meaningful difference in the lives of youth in Kenya.”"
Ariane 5 bulkhead design assessed for Airbus airliners - European Space Agency,"Mon, 01 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzYS5pbnQvRW5hYmxpbmdfU3VwcG9ydC9TcGFjZV9FbmdpbmVlcmluZ19UZWNobm9sb2d5L0FyaWFuZV81X2J1bGtoZWFkX2Rlc2lnbl9hc3Nlc3NlZF9mb3JfQWlyYnVzX2FpcmxpbmVyc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Enabling & Support Ariane 5 bulkhead design assessed for Airbus airliners 01/03/2021 3031 views 44 likes

An adapted version of a composite bulkhead that safeguards satellites during their ascent on the ESA-developed Ariane 5 launch vehicle has been tested for service aboard single aisle Airbus aircraft. Fitted in the rear tail cone, it would serve as a firewall to protect passengers in the event of the rear auxiliary power unit engine catching fire or the main cabin pressure bulkhead rupturing.

Ariane 5 liftoff Spanish structural specialist CITD collaborated in the design of the Ariane 5 bulkhead with Airbus Defence and Space Spain and worked with ESA’s Technology Transfer and Patent Office (TTPO) to probe the feasibility of transferring the design from rocket launcher to airliner. “The task of this bulkhead aboard Ariane 5 is to protect the satellite from the launcher exhaust, dust or overpressure from the launcher stage below it,” explains Marta García Cosío of CITD. “But the original version was a glass fibre cloth supported by massive aluminium rings and fasteners. It was very complicated to manipulate and integrate, so was seen as an opportunity for improvement. Accordingly we looked into the use of carbon-fibre reinforced polymer, CFRP – although new challenges appeared in turn.”

CFRP firewall with conduits and fire sensors Strong yet light CFRP is made by casting plastic resin with carbon fibres threaded through it for robustness, following a similar approach to steel-reinforced concrete. It can be moulded into complex rigid shapes, such as the aerodynamic bodies of Formula One automobiles, or the wingtips or noses of many modern aircraft – and the solid rocket motor casings of Europe's Ariane 6. “We came up with an effective wavy shape to render the flat CFRP bulkhead stiff and self-supporting, as well as pressure resistant,” adds Marta. “Then it flew for the first time aboard Ariane 5 in 2020 and is now the baseline for this launcher, as well as the upcoming Ariane 6.”

Mold to cast firewall But the CITD team thought that the ‘crumpled petal’ design also had potential for wider use, Marta explains: “We already had contacts with Airbus, and it seemed obvious to us this would be a good fit for commercial aviation as well. We pushed and pushed then finally, through ESA’s involvement, we got our chance to try.” CITD worked with TTPO, initially through a Feasibility project, then a follow-up Proof-of-Concept project which culminated in the prototype 2-m diameter bulkhead being successfully tested at Airbus, incorporating critical fuselage interfaces such as fuel and air bleed ducts and fire sensors. ESA structural engineer Shumit Das advised on the project: “The candidate bulkhead to replace was carefully chosen. We didn’t want to touch the primary bulkheads maintaining pressure in the cabin, instead we chose a secondary aft bulkhead, a firewall that is adjacent to the small gas turbine engine that provides power while the aircraft is on the ground, providing protection in the event of these engines catching fire.

Fitting firewall onto Airbus fuselage “The current bulkhead is a flat piece of titanium with hundreds of fasteners and stiffeners needed to stop it collapsing – which involves a long process to install. What the project team has done is swap this with a single piece of composite, made to exactly the right shape with all necessary holes for power and fuel conduits, and fire sensors. By saving hours at a time, this could have a big impact when it comes to integrating dozens of aircraft per month.” The Proof of Concept project was overseen for ESA by Technology Transfer officer Mercedes Sanchez Alvarez: “The fit check by Airbus Spain was the moment of truth. It always takes an effort to replace a legacy part, and if the manufacturing teams involved don’t like our demonstrator, then they won’t be interested in taking it further. The good news is the system installations went well, and CITD is now looking into taking the concept further, at the same time as Airbus is designing its coming generation of aircraft.” “This new CFRP firewall is a very promising revolutionary structural concept that will be considered for the next generation of aircraft,” states Javier Vazquez from Airbus’s research and technology team.

CFRP firewall tested for Airbus This next step would include overpressure and fire testing, and consideration of manufacturing scale options. The bulkhead demonstrator was cast from automotive grade composite material, for instance rather than the more costly aeronautic grade material. “We did this to keep costs low, but Airbus said that maybe it is a good idea, and any operational version could be made the same way,” adds Marta. “Because the company is looking into reducing costs as well, and if the existing bulkhead meets all performance requirements, why not?” Tommaso Ghidini, heading ESA’s Structures, Mechanisms and Materials Division, comments: “This is a great example of the kind of initiative that cuts across disciplines and industry sectors. By selecting just the right shape with the right materials, space engineers can combine form with function, to do more with less for our projects, and pass on enhanced efficiency to terrestrial sectors too.”"
Touring JetBlue’s new coach cabin on the Airbus A321neo - The Points Guy,"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL25ldy1qZXRibHVlLWVjb25vbXktdG91ci1hMzIxbGQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"JetBlue's newest plane is getting ready for takeoff.

In addition to offering the carrier's brand-new Mint Suite and Studio business-class products, JetBlue's latest Airbus A321neo, dubbed the A321LD, also features a redesigned economy cabin.

JetBlue first revolutionized the coach — or ""Core,"" as the airline calls it — experience when it became one of the first carriers to offer free live TV for every customer. Since then, the carrier has added free high-speed Wi-Fi, power outlets and USB ports to create an industry-leading offering that's won two TPG Awards.

Building on a strong foundation, JetBlue's new A321neo features the carrier's latest coach experience. Let's take a look inside.

Spacious 3-3 configuration

To start, the 144 coach seats are arranged in a 3-3 configuration spread across 24 rows.

Each features a width of 18.4 inches, which is above average for a narrowbody aircraft. Though our cabin tour was short, it didn't take long to appreciate the extra width.

Unlike JetBlue's all-coach A321neo which sports a second mini-cabin, economy on the A321LD is arranged in one large cabin.

JetBlue selected the Collins Meridian seat for this new coach cabin. The airline has been using the same seat for all retrofitted and new aircraft, including the soon-to-debut Airbus A220-300.

Forty-two of the 144 coach seats are designated as Even More Space (EMS) seats. The upcharge for these extra-legroom seats varies by route — but it typically ranges from $30 to $70. Mosaic elite members can also redeem TrueBlue points for these seats, or they can score one for free at the airport during check-in.

You may unsubscribe at any time.

The A321LD is the first JetBlue jet with all EMS seats located in the first seven rows of the cabin, thanks to the location of the overwing exit doors.

The Even More Space cabin starts with a bulkhead that features a bit of extra legroom. Note that you'll need to store all personal belongings in the overhead compartment if you're seated in Row 9. Also, the armrests are immovable, because the tray table folds out of them.

The next six rows sport standard Even More Space seats, easily identifiable by orange stitching, with 35 inches of pitch and standard recline.

The two exit rows — Row 13 and Row 14 — feature a similar amount of pitch as the other EMS seats, but the windows don't have an armrest.

As for the remaining standard ""Core"" seats, they each have 32 inches of pitch. The last row even reclines, but the close proximity to the lavatory could be bothersome.

Note that you'll want to avoid rows 23 and 24 due to missing windows.

JetBlue says that each seat features an enhanced cushion, but our 30-minute tour wasn't long enough to determine whether it was a noticeable improvement.

Each seat has adjustable, winged headrests that provide additional neck support for those looking to catch some shuteye.

Tray tables measure 17 inches wide and nine inches long, just big enough for my 13-inch MacBook Pro. It could definitely be a bit uncomfortable to work if you're seated in the middle with a full cabin.

JetBlue added its customized seat-back storage holders to the A321LD, which feature three individual mesh pockets, each capable of holding a water bottle and other loose items.

Lastly, the contoured seatback design creates a bit more space by the knees, a notable improvement for taller passengers.

Top-notch onboard entertainment and amenities

In addition to a spacious coach configuration, the A321LD is decked out with thoughtful amenities and enhanced connectivity.

The most noticeable improvement to the core experience is the refreshed pantry, which will be stocked with complimentary grab-and-go snacks and soft drinks. (Due to the pandemic, JetBlue has temporarily closed the pantry fleetwide.)

The old A321s with Mint, as well as the carrier's all-coach A321neos, also feature a walk-up pantry, but this one is the most modern of the bunch. It's located just behind the Mint cabin.

Each seat features a 10.1-inch high-res seat-back screen, the same ones you'll find on the carrier's Airbus A220-300s. Powered by the Thales AVANT Android-based software, the personal entertainment monitors are loaded with hundreds of movies, TV shows and over 100 channels of live TV.

The seat-back monitors feature an enhanced flight map, as well as the ability to use your own phone as a remote control.

Every passenger can access free gate-to-gate Wi-Fi. The carrier opted to install the faster ViaSat 2 satellite receivers onboard, which boosts internet coverage, speed and reliability compared to the older JetBlue planes.

Finally, each row is equipped with shared power outlets. Even More Space seats get one outlet per person, while there are two outlets for every three seats in standard ""Core.""

In addition to a universal power outlet, there's also a USB-A port at each outlet, as well as a second USB-A port underneath the seat-back monitor.

Unfortunately, JetBlue didn't install a USB-C port in the coach cabin, like it did for the new A220-300.

Cabin design, lavatories

The A321LD sports JetBlue's latest cabin design.

All four full-size lavatories feature a subway tile mosaic, in a nod to the carrier's New York hometown.

The forward lavatory is reserved for Mint flyers, while the remaining three are spread throughout the coach cabin.

There's one directly behind Mint, and two others at the back of the cabin.

While the plane boasts a host of flyer-friendly improvements, flight attendants will likely appreciate that the A321LD has heated galley floors.

Interestingly, there are no curtain dividers between Mint and coach.

Another subtle, yet notable improvement are the spacious overhead bins. The oversized Airspace XL bins first debuted with American Airlines back in 2019, and now they're making their way to JetBlue. They accommodate larger carry-on luggage and allow standard rollaboards to be loaded on their sides, creating room for one additional bag per bin.

The new Airspace XL bins will help JetBlue achieve its new carry-on bag guarantee, though note that basic economy flyers will no longer be allowed to bring a full-size carry-on, regardless of the aircraft type they're flying.

Bottom line

If you're flying in coach, you can't go wrong with JetBlue's new A321neo. If all goes to plan, the plane will launch on flights between New York-JFK and Los Angeles (LAX) as early as this June.

With a spacious economy configuration with ergonomic seats, personal TVs, high-speed Wi-Fi, power outlets and more, JetBlue's award-winning coach experience is only getting better.

Airbus agrees to avoid involuntary layoffs in three countries until 2023 - Aerospace Technology,"Fri, 05 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm9zcGFjZS10ZWNobm9sb2d5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1sYXlvZmYtaW52b2x1bnRhcnktMjAyMy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has entered an agreement with a German trade union to avoid involuntary layoffs in three countries until the end of 2023.

Under this deal, the aircraft manufacturer will protect jobs at its sites in France, Germany and the UK, reported Reuters.

The company will resort to other measures such as voluntary redundancy programmes, early retirement or internal transfers.

Last June, the company revealed plans to cut approximately 15,000 jobs worldwide, or 11% of its total workforce, as part of a restructuring following the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

This would affect 5,000 posts in France, 5,100 in Germany, 900 in Spain, 1,700 in the UK, and 1,300 elsewhere this year, according to the media agency.



Airbus was quoted by AFP as saying: “At this moment, and thanks to the effectiveness of all social measures deployed so far, Airbus does not see the need to implement forced redundancies in France, Germany and the UK.”

On 4 March, Airbus entered an agreement with German metalworkers’ union IG Metall to avoid thousands of forced redundancies in Europe.

The company employs 55,000 people in Germany.

Airbus workers council head Holger Junge head said in a news conference: “The decision of Airbus management to rule out forced redundancies is a huge relief for all of us.”"
Oh Hail! - Aviation Week,"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1hdmlhdGlvbi9zYWZldHktb3BzLXJlZ3VsYXRpb24vb2gtaGFpbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An airliner pulls into a gate exhibiting dramatic structural damage to its nose cone, wing leading edges and windshields. A stressed passenger proclaims, “It was the tensest 10 min. of my life.” Pictures of the damage caused by hail to Delta Air Lines Flight 1889 on Aug. 7, 2015, while en route from Boston Logan International Airport (KBOS) to Salt Lake City International Airport (KSLC), were jaw-dropping and resulted in an official NTSB investigation that revealed decision points not uncommon for pilots attempting to navigate around lines of convective activity.

The dispatch release packet contained SIGMET 1C, which warned of areas of severe thunderstorms moving from 250 deg. at 30 kt. with thunderstorm tops above FL 450. Tornadoes, hail up to 2 in. and wind gusts to 60 kt. were all possible in these severe thunderstorms. The Minneapolis Center controller informed the flight crew of the large area of moderate-to-extreme precipitation at their 12 o’clock position and 130 mi. out, and advised them of the decisions of other flight crews headed in that direction to deviate well north or south around that area. The Delta flight crew chose to continue toward the gap in the weather, and both pilots believed they would be able to maintain at least 20 mi. lateral separation between each individual thunderstorm cell (as required by Delta procedures for thunderstorm avoidance). With the flight still more than 50 mi. from the thunderstorms, the gap in thunderstorm activity had closed to 12 mi.

The pilot of eastbound Southwest Airlines Flight 3318, which had just passed through the hole in the weather in the opposite direction, provided a pilot weather report (PIREP) to the Denver Center controller indicating that the hole was starting to close and that he did not think anybody should go through it behind them. However, the Denver Center controller did not provide this PIREP to the Delta flight crew.

At the time that the Delta flight entered the gap, the distance between the areas of thunderstorm activity had reduced to less than 10 mi. and was continuing to decrease. According to the incident captain, he also noted a temperature increase at cruise altitude, followed by a ""rough ride"" and ""static discharge,"" and he was briefly unable to hear the radio due to the static interference. The captain decided to turn away from the weather, and the Denver Center controller provided him a heading to avoid the weather. As the airplane began to turn left, its radar display showed additional weather, and the flight crew chose to turn back to the right.

The flight then began to encounter hail, which shattered the outside panes of the forward windows. In addition, the wing leading edges, engine cowlings, parts of the aircraft skin, and especially the radome sustained surface damage. The nose cone damage also resulted in damage to the airborne weather radar antenna, which rendered the system unusable. The flight crew declared an emergency, diverted to Denver and requested an ILS approach due to the visibility problems through the shattered outer panes of the windshield. The aircraft landed safely on Denver's Runway 35L.

The NTSB determined that the flight crew's continued flight into a closing gap between areas of thunderstorm activity and their failure to maintain the required lateral separation from the thunderstorms resulted in the airliner's encounter with hail and subsequent airplane damage.

Hail Encounters

Despite onboard radar, aircraft are still experiencing substantial damage from hail encounters. For this report BCA examined an international aviation incident database (avherald.com) for inflight hail encounters between 2017 and 2019. We found a total of 20 incident summaries that reported substantial damage. The aircraft types involved included two turboprop transports, one regional jet, 15 medium jet transports ( Boeing 737 and Airbus 320, for example) and two widebodies. Seven of the incidents occurred in the climb phase of flight, seven during cruise and six during descent.

Seven of the incident reports indicated that the aircraft’s altitude at the time of the hail strike exceeded FL 300 (nine reports were missing the altitude information). This is problematic because upper levels of a towering cumulonimbus are far above the freezing level, where any form of precipitation is likely to be in the form of “dry” hail. Dry hail is a pellet that is completely frozen without a thin layer of water on the surface, and is a very poor reflector of energy. Thus, it can lead to a flight crew underestimating a storm’s intensity.

Windscreens and radomes take a battering in hail encounters. Thirteen of the 20 hail incidents caused substantial damage to the windscreen. Windscreens are designed under the damage tolerance concept to withstand much larger impacts from bird strikes, thus the damage is usually confined to the outer ply while the inner plies maintain sufficient structural integrity to keep the entire windscreen from imploding inward onto the flight crew. Nonetheless, a high-speed encounter with hail is likely to damage the outer ply of the windscreen bad enough to completely obscure forward visibility for the landing.

Eleven of the 20 aircraft experienced substantial damage to the radome. Damage to the aircraft’s nose can be severe enough to cause structural failure of the radome whose debris then causes a cascading chain of structural damage to other portions of the aircraft. This occurred on June 9, 2006, to Asiana Airlines Flight 8942, an Airbus 321-100, while en route from Jeju International Airport (RKPC) to Gimpo International Airport (RKSS) in South Korea. Hail pummeled the aircraft for 36 sec., causing enough structural weakening to the radome that it detached from the front of the aircraft. Components of the weather radar were destroyed due to exposure from the hail. The noise generated by the detaching radome seriously hindered conversations between the flight crewmembers and with the approach controllers. Fifty-two separate failure messages saturated the flight crew’s attention span. Not only were the captain’s and first officer’s airspeed indicators showing large differences from each other, but the aircraft also exhibited a banking tendency that further complicated control. While dealing with those emergency conditions, the aircraft was flying toward mountainous terrain. ATC provided instructions to climb to avoid getting any nearer to terrain.

The Airbus’ cracked windshield seriously impeded the flight crew from having visual contact with the runway and making a landing. Flight 8942 executed two missed approaches due to difficulties encountered with speed and altitude control as well as the inability to see the runway environment through the severely cracked windshield. A more-experienced air traffic controller was then utilized to provide a PAR (precision approach radar) whereupon the aircraft was landed safely without further incident. The accident report lauded the captain for “completing his mission by safely landing the aircraft under the exceptional situation.”

Post-landing inspection of the aircraft found substantial damage to the radome, windshield, nose structure, wing leading edges, wing skins, engine cowlings, engine nacelles and horizontal stabilizer leading edges. Debris from the radome struck the bottom of the left wing, causing skin damage. Forty indentations were found on the forward pressure bulkhead. The left engine also was damaged by debris from the radome, causing rivet heads to break off. Total damage to the aircraft was estimated to be about $3.5 million.

"KID-Systeme talks aircraft W-IFE linefit, retrofit and monetization - Runway Girl Network","Tue, 23 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjEvMDMva2lkLXN5c3RlbWUtdGFsa3MtYWlyY3JhZnQtdy1pZmUtbGluZWZpdC1yZXRyb2ZpdC1hbmQtbW9uZXRpemF0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"KID-Systeme GmbH confirms it is supporting Airbus’ new linefit W-IFE solution by providing the wireless hardware for the ALNA-Open Software Platform. This positions KID-Systeme — a wholly-owned subsidiary of Airbus which operates as an independent company — to secure new contracts for its SKYfi-branded retrofit offering as and when linefit customers seek commonality for in-service aircraft.

To be clear, KID-Systeme is not a content or software provider. It worked with Airbus to pioneer the linefit Airline Network Architecture (ALNA) for inflight connectivity in 2007. Airbus recently started allowing airlines to effectively take the onboard wireless part of ALNA for content streaming. So now, KID-Systeme’s hardware is also being used for ALNA-OSP, the backbone of Airbus’ new linefit W-IFE solution.

As such, KID-Systeme will not participate in ALNA-OSP in the same way that, say, Bluebox Aviation Systems and other subscribers of the new OSP program will participate. “We are the enabler for all software providers and suppliers to get on a state-of-the-art, proven and reliable linefit solution with their products,” confirmed KID-Systeme director of marketing and strategy Matthias Zachäus and product manager Andreas Fuchs. The linefit W-IFE solution will initially be available for A320 and A330 family aircraft.

Given KID-Systeme’s favorable positioning, its SKIfi hardware stands to benefit in the retrofit market. To date, SKIfi has secured “several hundreds of installations worldwide through leading aircraft manufacturers including Airbus and Boeing”, according to KID-Systeme’s online marketing materials.

But Zachäus and Fuchs confirm to Runway Girl Network that the “complete marketing and sales activities” around Airbus’ linefit W-IFE “are beneficial, especially when we are talking about mixed fleets and fleet commonality. The hardware and basic software are ideal for creating a unique product and brand appearance for the airline, due to the autonomy of the software solution.”

They see this autonomy as a differentiator in the retrofit market, especially as wireless IFE is seeing fresh momentum amid the COVID-19 crisis. Asked what type of interest the firm is fielding for SKYfi during the pandemic, the two executives said:

SKYfi became an open platform. Our customers can decide with which software they want to implement and through from whom. We are the hardware experts and deliver a product with many interfaces for all applications wanted or needed. And that is a significant difference to our competitors — the Open Software Platform is an independent platform and flexible hardware solution for Airbus and Embraer linefit or in retrofit – on any other aircraft type.

The Embraer arrangement was announced in 2017. Among KID-Systeme’s rivals, Kontron has long embraced an open source approach. We await word on Boeing’s chosen partner for its new wireless IFE solution, Boeing Digital Direct.

In terms of onboard trends, say the two KID-Systeme executives, “we see the trend to BYOD is increasing. Passengers using their own devices minimizing the ‘touch points’ in the cabin. Therefore, we also acknowledge an amplification of WiFi and connectivity needs in the aircraft cabin. And we see the ancillary revenue providers coming into the market. So, the interest and necessity for an Open Software Platform is present, especially for an independent one like SKYfi.

“Some airlines already have hardware, some don’t. For the inexpensive and flexible integration of content and applications it is indispensable to work with an open product which guarantees maximum freedom at a minimum cost for implementation.”

KID-Systeme is also an in-seat power supplier, duking it out against industry stalwart Astronics Corporation and others in the space. A few years ago, the company tabled a MoneyPower add-on to its existing SKYpower offering to enable airlines to monetize in-seat power.

“We have a lot of discussions with airlines about this solution. We talk about integration and operability. Based on the customer feedback and interest, we hold on to this concept and re-engineer it to offer an even better design. We believe that we will see an increase of ancillary revenue concepts for the passenger cabin during the ramp up after the COVID-19-crisis,” said Zachäus and Fuchs.

Meanwhile, the firm’s solutions for onboard video surveillance — its Cargo Cam and Cabin Cam products — are still on offer, but business is, understandably, seeing a lull: “There is a halting behaviour on the market. We talk about reflections regarding GDPR for example. But the product is ready and we successfully concluded big programs in the past,” they noted.

Etihad Airways likely retiring Airbus A380 and The Residence - Business Insider,"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vZXRpaGFkLWFpcndheXMtbGlrZWx5LXJldGlyaW5nLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLWFuZC10aGUtcmVzaWRlbmNlLTIwMjEtM9IBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vZXRpaGFkLWFpcndheXMtbGlrZWx5LXJldGlyaW5nLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLWFuZC10aGUtcmVzaWRlbmNlLTIwMjEtMz9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By clicking “Sign Up”, you accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy .

Etihad Airways is the latest airline that's preparing to say goodbye to the world's largest passenger jet.

Tony Douglas, CEO of Etihad Aviation Group, said in an interview with The National that the airline's Airbus A380s may soon become a casualty of the pandemic.

""We have now taken the strategic decision to park the A380s, I'm sure it's very likely that we won't see them operating with Etihad again,"" Douglas told the publication.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

The move is the latest nail in the coffin for the dying aircraft program and would mean the end of Etihad's ultra-exclusive cabin, known as ""The Residence,"" found exclusively on the A380s. A step above even first class, The Residence is among the pinnacles of luxury travel that offered flyers multi-room apartments in the skies.

Ticket prices regularly exceeded $20,000 for a one-way journey, and securing a seat was a bucket-list item for aviation enthusiasts.

Entrepreneurial frequent flyers could also find themselves in the cabin without paying the exorbitant costs. Travel blogger Sam Huang, for example, paid only 60,000 American Airlines AAdvantage miles and $108 for a $23,000 flight in the cabin from Abu Dhabi, UAE to Sydney, Australia in 2016.

A ticket for The Residence granted access to the most exclusive areas of the airport including secret areas of Etihad's newest lounges complete with full bars, sit-down dining, and showers, followed by chauffeur service to the departure gate.

The fully-enclosed suites, more comparable to a New York City studio apartment than first class on any US carrier, come complete with a sofa, recliner chair, closet, minibar, and a full vanity mirror. Connected to the suite are a private bedroom and en suite bathroom with its own shower, all on the upper level of the Airbus A380.

Flight attendants serving the cabin are also complemented by a Savoy Hotel-trained butler that roams the cabin, as well as an onboard chef to prepare meals. High-end champagne and expensive caviar were frequent choices of the well-to-do guests.

Etihad, unlike fellow UAE-based airline Emirates, didn't invest in having a large fleet of A380s and only operated 10 prior to the pandemic that served its top routes to cities including London, UK; New York; Sydney, Australia; Paris, France; and Seoul, South Korea.

The strategy was similar to Middle Eastern rival Qatar Airways, which is also downsizing its A380 fleet as it charts a post-pandemic recovery.

""The A380, I think, is one of the worst aircraft when it comes to emissions that is flying around today,"" Akbar Al Baker, group chief executive officer of Qatar Airways, said in January at a Centre for Aviation CAPA Live event, as CNN reported.

Qatar Airways has already retired half of its formerly 10-aircraft-strong A380 fleet, primarily used on routes to popular European and Asian-Pacific cities. Both Qatar Airways and Etihad have invested more in twin-engine aircraft like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, Boeing 777X, and Airbus A350 XWB over the A380, which served more as a status symbol.

Airbus' largest passenger jet was among the earliest casualties of the pandemic as airlines struggled to fill the massive cabins intended to shuttle hundreds of flyers at a time. Air France abruptly retired its A380 fleet in May while Lufthansa, Qantas, and British Airways have sent their double-decker fleets into storage to ride out the pandemic.

Of Lufthansa's 14 A380s, six are slated for retirement, and eight have been ""temporarily decommissioned"" with little prospects for a return to passenger service, according to the company's 2020 annual report.

The Boeing 747 was similarly dropped by countless passenger carriers like Virgin Atlantic Airways, British Airways, and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. But the jet proved invaluable to the cargo realm of the industry that carried everything from personal protective equipment that kept healthcare workers safe to home office equipment that fueled the protracted work-from-home economy.

Portuguese charter airline Hi Fly began flying A380 cargo flights during the pandemic but ultimately parted with the aircraft in 2020 at the end of its lease.

The Airbus A380 entered passenger service at a time when airlines were starting to look for smaller aircraft and the pandemic only accelerated its increasingly short-lived tenure. All Nippon Airways was the last new customer to take delivery of a new A380 in 2019, just 14 years following the aircraft's first test flight in 2015.

Emirates will likely be the last carrier to fly the A380 as the world's largest operator of the model. Airbus is gearing up for the final delivery, slated for May 2022, and has already trucked the final fuselage to its Toulouse production facility."
'Mule guy' takes reins at Airbus Columbus - The Commercial Dispatch,"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vY2Rpc3BhdGNoLmNvbS9jYXRlZ29yeS1uZXdzL211bGUtZ3V5LXRha2VzLXJlaW5zLWF0LWFpcmJ1cy1jb2x1bWJ1cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On one end of the open bay at Building A on the Airbus campus sat two helicopters, which provided a backdrop for the company’s announcement of a new manager for the facility.

Before outgoing manager Mike Spears or his successor Johannes Dienemann spoke, the two helicopters had already told a big part of the Airbus Columbus story, which began in 2003 and has seen the plant build or assemble more than 14,000 helicopters since.

At one end sat a sleek twin-engine helicopter built for NASA to perform surveillance and security operations. At the other end sat a single-engine aircraft built for mosquito control for a customer in Florida.

“The diversity we have here is key for us,” said Spears, who is retiring after eight years as the Airbus Columbus manager. “We do everything from full assembly to customizing aircraft to fit the requirements or needs from law enforcement to medical and everything in between.”

The changing of the guard also reflects that diversity. Spears grew up farming in south Alabama. Dienemann, 42, was born in Berlin, Germany, and studied in Australia and Ohio, before beginning his career in France — when Airbus was known American Eurocopter — in 2007.

Although he is the new man in charge in Columbus, he is no stranger to the facility.

Since moving to the U.S., for good in 2008, Dienemann has spent much of the past two years shuttling between Dallas and Columbus.

“Now I get the opportunity to spend my time in Columbus and I’m excited about that,” he said. “It’s exciting what’s happening here and to be a part of it.”

Dienemann’s history goes back to a pivotal moment in the company’s history. In 2006, the company landed a contract with the U.S. Army to build LUH Lakota helicopters, which quickly became the Columbus facility’s bread and butter.

“When I first started (at Airbus) they sent me to Huntsville, Alabama, just as the Lakota program was ramping up,” Dienemann said. “So my connection to that aircraft goes back almost to the start.”

Spears said Airbus Columbus has produced about half of the Army’s current 463 Lakota fleet.

While Dienemann’s connection to the company’s Lakota production is traced almost to the beginning, Spears arrived in Columbus at a time when Army demand for the aircraft was waning.

“When I first got here eight years ago, the Army was talking about winding the Lakota down, so we realized we had to do something to stabilize what we were doing,” Spears said. “That’s when we brought the full assembly line for the H-125 from France. We got that up and running and then a few years later we moved our completion center here, which is where we customize aircraft for the customers’ needs. On top of that, while we had always done some maintenance work on the Lakotas for the Army, we’ve doubled, maybe tripled our maintenance work. So now we have two assembly lines, the completion center and maintenance going on.”

Dienemann said Airbus Columbus works on “six or seven” of the company’s 15 unique aircrafts, something he said is a tribute to the 270 employees at the Columbus facility.

“We have an almost endless spectrum of work,” he said. “We build some helicopters from scratch, some from parts and pieces, some fully assembled that we do completion work on and maintenance, so it’s a very diverse type of work. We have people in our shops that make wire harnesses, assemble engines, assemble gear boxes, paint on all those different aircraft. We have 60 to 70 aircraft come through here every year. So we have to make sure we cross-train our people for our production lines and completion center. That’s a tribute to the skill and talent of our workforce.”

While the backgrounds of the outgoing manager and his successor are different, they do share one common bond, and an unusual one at that.

FCAS: Dassault ready for “plan B” if cooperation with Airbus fails - AeroTime,"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjc0ODQtZGFzc2F1bHQtcmVhZHktZm9yLXBsYW4tYi1pZi1haXJidXMtY29vcGVyYXRpb24tZmFpbC1mY2Fz0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWVyb3RpbWUuYWVyby9hcnRpY2xlcy8yNzQ4NC1kYXNzYXVsdC1yZWFkeS1mb3ItcGxhbi1iLWlmLWFpcmJ1cy1jb29wZXJhdGlvbi1mYWlsLWZjYXMvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Since the beginning of 2021, many voices have been heard doubting the feasibility of the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) program, a “system of systems” built around a sixth-generation fighter jet, the Next Generation Fighter (NGF). Contracted by the authorities of France, Germany, and Spain, the program brings together the competency of various European manufacturers under the leadership of Dassault Aviation and Airbus Defense and Space.

On March 10, 2021, Éric Trappier, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Dassault Aviation, was heard by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defense and Armed Forces of the French Senate, to discuss the relevance of the project and its viability.

Dassault Aviation feels cornered

Trappier criticized the inclusion of Spain in the project, which hinders the leadership initially given to France. He explained that in the case of a disagreement, matters are sent to the three procurement agencies of the three states. “If two states ally, they will make the decisions,” he explained. “How can we ensure our French leadership and our French project management in such an organization?”

He also regretted the inclusion of the Spanish branch of Airbus in the program, which created an imbalance in the negotiations. “For the NGF and Pillar 1, it’s a two-person household, with Airbus and Dassault. But then, Airbus will weigh two-thirds and Dassault a third. It shifted from the 50/50 equilibrium where Dassault held the lead, to two-thirds/one-third.”

And Airbus’ weight in the project already forced Dassault to make concessions. For example, Dassault reportedly accepted that about 50% of “work packages” were to be done without a designated manager and that the other half would be divided into three, leaving only a third for the French manufacturer to lead.

This manager-less system was the one adopted by the Eurofighter partners (that included Germany and Spain, but not France) for the development of the Typhoon. That model, however, could result in a budget overrun and unclear operational needs, according to Trappier. “The Rafale did not cost France more than the Eurofighter did Germany, the United Kingdom or Italy,” noted Dassault’s CEO. “I let the operational staff judge and establish a comparison between the Eurofighter and the Rafale, but I can say that the Rafale lands on an aircraft carrier and carries the airborne nuclear component (CNA), which is not the case with the Eurofighter.”

Germany was also given the leadership of Pillar 3, which concerns the development of “remote carriers” ‒ combat drones that would assist the fighter jet much like the “loyal wingmen” concepts developed by the United States, Australia, or Russia.

Dassault already has experience in the domains, having led the development of the nEUROn stealth combat drone demonstrator whose maiden flight dates back to December 2012. But on November 5, 2019, Airbus Defense and Space unveiled the existence of its “Low Observable UAV Testbed”, or LOUT. Developed in secret, the demonstrator visibly gave Airbus enough leverage to be awarded Pillar 3.

More points of contention

Despite the concessions already made, Germany and Airbus are now asking for more, according to Trappier. They required to also have the final word about the flight controls of the NGF, the aircraft’s “nervous system, essential for its safety and maneuverability,” the cockpit, and the stealth capability. In these conditions, Dassault would not have any leverage over the strategic areas of the NGF, despite having received the leadership of its development.

Germany further upped the ante on intellectual property. In the words of Luftwaffe Chief of Staff Ingo Gerhartz, Berlin would refuse to deal with technological “black boxes” over which it could not have control due to the lack of intellectual property. “It should be possible to hand intellectual property rights from one branch of industry to the other so that all partners can make their own developments in the future,” Gerhartz commented, hinting at the use of Dassault’s technologies for other German programs.

“Intellectual property is not a black box,” answered Trappier. “In the FCAS, the States will know everything that is on the plane and can even modify it. Knowing how a system and an aircraft work and how it is designed, however, does not require knowledge of the rules to achieve the result. […] If I give my background today and the program is canceled in two years, how would I be protected from the competition?”

A plan B? Yes, but not alone

Thus, Dassault is already studying the possibility of a “plan B” if the situation is not resolved. “My plan B does not necessarily consist in doing it alone, but in finding a method of governance that allows Europeans to be brought in, but not according to the rules set today, because that will not work,” Dassault’s CEO hinted.

The method of governance that Trappier alluded to could be the one that led to the development of the nEUROn. Unlike the FCAS which has to answer to three countries, the nEUROn was developed under the aegis of a single procurement and technology agency, the French Directorate General of Armaments (DGA). Instead of being imposed by the government, the industrial base was integrally composed by Dassault Aviation as the prime contractor. “For the nEUROn, the State asked us to find partners and we have found partners[…] and we have built political cooperation around an industrial project. It is the opposite today,” Trappier argued. “Finding other partners is not up to me, but to the State. I did not choose Germany, the decision is political.”

As a reminder, Dassault had chosen the French group Thales, Leonardo for Italy, Saab for Sweden, EADS-CASA (since merged into Airbus Defense and Space) for Spain, HAI for Greece, and RUAG for Switzerland, to participate in the development of the nEUROn. “For €450 million, half of which was paid by France, we managed to fly a drone the size of a Mirage 2000, ultra stealthy in fairly fast conditions and in six countries,” he recalled. “I can’t tell you about the performance, since it is classified, but it is better than expected and on budget.”

The matter now appears to be in the hand of the authorities. Questioned on the problems currently affecting the FCAS, the French Minister of Armed Forces Florence Parly said she required, along with her German counterpart Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, for the industrialists to continue the discussions in order to reach an agreement… if possible.

“However, we should not forget the major principles which have been laid down by the President of the Republic [Emmanuel Macron] and the Chancellor [Angela Merkel] since the beginning,” Parly commented. It seems unlikely, however, that the Bundestag, which repeatedly voiced its concern that the project was favoring the French industry over the German one, will sing the same tune.

On March 17, 2021, Dirk Hoke, CEO of Airbus Defence and Space, was heard by the French Senate on the same subject. “There is no Plan B,” Hoke said. “Plan B is FCAS, any other solution would be much less favorable for everyone.”"
Southwest Leans to Boeing 737 Max Order After Rare Flirtation With Airbus - airlineweekly.skift.com,"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZXdlZWtseS5za2lmdC5jb20vMjAyMS8wMy9zb3V0aHdlc3QtbGVhbnMtdG8tYm9laW5nLTczNy1tYXgtb3JkZXItYWZ0ZXItcmFyZS1mbGlydGF0aW9uLXdpdGgtYWlyYnVzL9IBeGh0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZXdlZWtseS5za2lmdC5jb20vMjAyMS8wMy9zb3V0aHdlc3QtbGVhbnMtdG8tYm9laW5nLTczNy1tYXgtb3JkZXItYWZ0ZXItcmFyZS1mbGlydGF0aW9uLXdpdGgtYWlyYnVzLz9hbXA9MQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Southwest Airlines appears poised to stay an all-Boeing 737 operator after giving the Airbus A220 a close look during the Max grounding.

Speaking at a J.P. Morgan investor conference on Monday, Southwest Chief Financial Officer Tammy Romo said the carrier “continues to believe that there are many advantages to having a single fleet type, including a greater degree of simplicity and efficiency, translating to lower costs,” according to a report on the session. She did note that the A220 was a “viable competitor” to the Boeing 737 Max.

The comments were arguably the least surprising yet among the most momentous at the event. Boeing’s future as a major commercial aircraft manufacturer hangs, at least partially, on the Dallas-based carrier’s pending order for a jet to replace many of the 470 737-700s in its fleet over the next decade. A defection to the A220 by the largest 737 operator in the world would be a huge blow to the planemaker at a time when it is desperate to rebuild its tattered reputation after the 20-month Max grounding.

To be clear, Romo did not commit to an order for the 737-7 at the conference. However, her comments fit with a recent Reuters report that Boeing and Southwest are near a “multibillion-dollar deal” for dozens of the jet.

Southwest reintroduced the Max on March 11 after nearly two years. The 737-8 will fly just 10 routes on any given day until mid-April when the aircraft will begin flying across the airline’s network. Southwest plans to operate 69 737-8s by year-end.

And initial reports indicate travelers are not as wary of the Max as was suggested during the grounding. American Airlines, the first to resume Max flights in the U.S., did not see travelers booking away or changing their flights during the first weeks of service for its 737-8s.

Southwest’s orderbook stood at 249 firm Maxes plus 115 options at the end of 2020. The firm orders included 30 737-7s with the first seven due this year, plus 219 firm 737-8s and 115 options.

The airline confirmed that it was considering the A220-300 and 737-7 for the 140-150 seat segment of its future fleet last October. At the time, Chief Operating Officer Mike Van de Ven said they were “looking at both airplanes,” and planned to continue their evaluations. The comments came more than a year after The Air Current broke the news that Southwest executives had visited an A220 operator in Europe to kick “the proverbial tires” on the aircraft.

But in the months since Van de Ven’s comments, the Max was re-certified by the FAA and other global regulators, and Boeing has racked up hundreds of new orders from opportunistic airlines. Alaska Airlines, Ryanair and United Airlines have all made sizable new commitments to the jet — though the airframer remained down 759 orders for the 737 at the end of February.

Snagging an add-on order for the 737-7 from an existing Max customer will not be enough for Boeing to climb out of its hole. Besides its Max problems, Boeing has been plagued with production delays for its 787 widebodies. At a separate panel at the conference, Air Lease Corp. CEO John Plueger urged Boeing to iron out its manufacturing problems, saying the airframer has to “fix its house.”"

"Airbus, Boeing vie as Qantas says “now is the time to buy” - ch-aviation","Mon, 22 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoLWF2aWF0aW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzLzEwMTc0MC1haXJidXMtYm9laW5nLXZpZS1hcy1xYW50YXMtc2F5cy1ub3ctaXMtdGhlLXRpbWUtdG8tYnV50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As Airbus and Boeing vie for a multi-billion dollar Qantas (QF, Sydney Kingsford Smith) order to replace its ageing B737-800 fleet, the Australian carrier's president and chief executive Alan Joyce has said at a conference that, as prices are so low, now is time to acquire them.

The fierce runoff is between the A320neo Family and the B737 MAX, as Qantas looks beyond the expected recovery in demand for air travel in 2023-2024 through to the 2040s.

“We have to replace the domestic fleet over the next decade. Now is the time to order aircraft because the prices are very good,” Joyce told The Australian Financial Review’s Business Summit, which took place at the Hilton Sydney on March 9-10, as quoted by Executive Traveller.

“We know that aircraft prices are very attractive out there, so it’s a big opportunity for us to get really low prices for some period of time.”

Attending to the domestic fleet is one of “two big projects we’ll have on,” the other being to reassess the viability of Project Sunrise flights, the direct routes connecting Australia and Europe which may now have the prospect of launching in mid-2024.

Qantas revealed in February that it was considering launching a tender process later in 2021 to renew its domestic fleet. According to the ch-aviation fleets module, the airline currently operates seventy-five B737-800s, which have an average age of 13.0 years. Of these, 33 are between 15 and 20 years of age. Sixteen of the 75 are leased, while 59 are owned.

The airline also operates eighteen A330-200s, ten A330-300s, and eleven B787-9s, as well as twelve A380-800s that Qantas has placed in long-term storage.

Qantas Group already has 109 A320neo Family jets on order (45 A320neo and 64 A321neo including the A321-200NX(LR) and A321-200NY(XLR) variants) for various low-cost affiliates such as Jetstar Airways, Jetstar Asia Airways, and Jetstar Japan, while the group’s regional carrier Network Aviation (NWK, Perth International) operates routes in Western Australia under the QantasLink brand.

Joyce has said previously that “we’ll take a decision closer to the time of delivery about which parts of the group will use these aircraft, but there is plenty of potential across Qantas and Jetstar.”

However, basing Qantas’ future domestic fleet around the MAX would continue a relationship in place since October 1993, when the airline took delivery of its first B737, a B737-300, the first of twenty-one of the type according to the ch-aviation fleets history module, followed by twenty-two B737-400s."

Airbus' A300 Beluga Is the World's Strangest Looking Cargo Plane - The National Interest Online,"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWxpbnRlcmVzdC5vcmcvYmxvZy9yZWJvb3QvYWlyYnVzJUUyJTgwJTk5LWEzMDAtYmVsdWdhLXdvcmxkJUUyJTgwJTk5cy1zdHJhbmdlc3QtbG9va2luZy1jYXJnby1wbGFuZS0xODAzNzTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Although the cargo area is temperature-controlled, it is not pressurized.

Here's What You Need to Remember: Still, as Airbus’ first oversize cargo plane the Beluga provides a crucial function—and can be seen from miles away.

Airbus is a truly pan-European corporation, and as such has production facilities in Spain, France, Germany, the United Kingdom—not to mention the United States, Canada, and China. Final assembly of Airbus airframes generally takes place in various centers in Europe.

Due to the decentralized nature of production, parts for Boeing airframes are shipped across Europe—a time-consuming and expensive process that was historically done by road transport, or rail when possible. Rail and road transport are not ideal—they’re slow, and expensive. In the late 1980s and 1990s, Airbus needed something big enough to transport their components by air.

Super Guppy

There was one option—the American-built Super Guppy oversize transport, built by Aero Spacelines of California. As I previously wrote, the Super Guppy was an elongated, large-domed airframe that NASA had contracted to transport bulky parts for the Apollo program and other missions from the West Coast to Florida, for final assembly at Cape Canaveral.

The Super Guppy design was based on a C-97J Turbo Stratocruiser—a Boeing design. Boeing was, and remains, Airbus’ arch-rival. But they had what Airbus needed.

The Super Guppy airframes were based on 1940s-era passenger airline airframes. By the 1980s they had started showing their age. So, Airbus decided to drop the Guppies in favor of their own design, tailored to Airbus needs.

Big Beluga

Airbus settled on the Airbus A300, a capable and proven wide-body airliner that originally debuted in the mid-1970s. Engineers got to work modifying the A300 for oversize cargo transport.

The A300’s nose and cockpit were lowered slightly to give loading crews straight-in access to the cargo bay, which cut down loading and unloading times. The other advantage to a lowered immovable cockpit is that the Beluga does not have to disconnect electrical and flight systems between loads, which greatly reduces loading and unloading time.

The top of the fuselage was expanded to twenty-five feet in diameter, giving the Beluga its customary puffy look. Loading is done through the top of the expanded section. This section opens upwards, in contrast the Super Guppies, which pivot outwards on hinges like a door.

The Beluga’s transported one of its more unusual cargo items in 1999. A Beluga flew with Eugène Delacroix’s iconic painting Liberty Leading the People, a stylized depiction of the French Revolution. The painting itself was nearly ten feet tall and twelve feet wide, and could not fit inside other commercial airliners, so the Beluga stepped in and flew it from Paris to Tokyo.

In addition to one-of-a-kind pieces of art, the Beluga has transported components for the International Space Station, large pieces of industrial machinery, and even other planes and helicopters.

Although the cargo area is temperature-controlled, it is not pressurized. It therefore cannot carry certain types of cargo, such as live animals. It is also somewhat hindered by its payload capacity—only 47 tons.

Still, as Airbus’ first oversize cargo plane the Beluga provides a crucial function—and can be seen from miles away.

Scheduled to launch in April 2021 on a Vega launcher, Pléiades Neo 3, the first of the new generation of very high-resolution satellites will join the existing Airbus fleet of optical and radar satellites, with increased resolution, revisit and coverage. It will be closely followed by its twin, Pléiades Neo 4, also scheduled for launch on a Vega rocket a few weeks later.

Entirely funded, manufactured, owned and operated by Airbus, Pléiades Neo will provide commercial and institutional customers with high-level insights for the next decade. Each satellite will add half a million km² per day at 30cm native resolution. The images will be easily accessible on Airbus’ OneAtlas digital platform, allowing customers immediate access to both freshly acquired and archive data, as well as extensive analytics.

Comprising four identical satellites, the Pléiades Neo fleet will work hand in hand with the existing Pléiades satellites. The highly compact Pléiades Neo spacecraft have a light weight, next generation silicon carbide optical instrument. They also have inter-satellite links with SpaceDataHighway (EDRS) geostationary satellites to enable urgent acquisitions just 30 to 40 minutes following the tasking request to swiftly respond to the most critical situations.

Should Airbus And Boeing Develop New Aircraft Based On Existing Tech? - Aviation Week,"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L2FpcmNyYWZ0LXByb3B1bHNpb24vc2hvdWxkLWFpcmJ1cy1ib2VpbmctZGV2ZWxvcC1uZXctYWlyY3JhZnQtYmFzZWQtZXhpc3RpbmctdGVjaNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ask the Editors: The Aviation Week Network invites our readers to submit questions to our editors and analysts. We’ll answer them, and if we can’t we’ll reach out to our wide network of experts for advice.

Does it even make sense to develop brand new aircraft based on existing technology? Should Boeing and Airbus instead concentrate on disrupting themselves?

This question came up during a recent Aviation Week webinar. Panelist Sash Tusa, an aerospace analyst at London-based research firm Agency Partners, answers:

The problem with “disruption” as often understood in the technology, automotive or even space sectors is that these areas have rapid paybacks—certainly relative to the decade or longer cycles of civil aircraft and engines—and relatively high tolerance of product failure and in-service problems. Likely none of those reading this would want to fly in a passenger jet that does not at least meet current levels of safety. This drives certification standards and timescales that may appear inflexible but have stood the test of time, safety and passenger acceptance.

In our view, it is extremely unlikely that either Airbus or Boeing would develop a new model using existing technology—defined as being the design and manufacturing technology used for aircraft currently in production. It is near axiomatic in this industry that any new model needs to offer 15% better economics than the models that it would replace, and such an improvement can only come from major changes and improvements in airframes, engines and systems.

So any new large aircraft (more than 150 seats) launched this decade (for production all through the 2030s and into the 2040s) is likely to need a combination of:

A new geared turbofan (GTF). While there is only one GTF in service at present, from Pratt & Whitney, both Rolls-Royce (with UltraFan) and GE/CFM are working on their own designs. But a standard turbofan will simply not cut it, especially since any new engine will likely need to be ready to accept 100% synthetic aviation fuels and probably also hydrogen. Our view is that any smaller aircraft (fewer than 100 seats) will need a technology path to electric or hybrid propulsion.

Extensive use of room-temperature (“cold-cure”) composites, especially for the wings.

A design and manufacturing process that wholly adopts digital design and supply chain management to reduce cycle times, working capital, labor cost and the current heavy use of over-specialized jigs and tooling.

This may not sound much like disruption to some, but it could produce step changes in economics, production costs and emissions, and hence sociopolitical acceptance of air travel.

"Too big, too late: did Covid-19 make a dinosaur of the A380? - Style","Fri, 19 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lcy9zdHlsZS9sdXh1cnkvYXJ0aWNsZS8zMTI2MTE3L2VuZC1ldGloYWRzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLWFuZC1pdHMtbHV4ZS1yZXNpZGVuY2Utc3VpdGUtYWtiYXLSAXZodHRwczovL2FtcC5zY21wLmNvbS9tYWdhemluZXMvc3R5bGUvbHV4dXJ5L2FydGljbGUvMzEyNjExNy9lbmQtZXRpaGFkcy1haXJidXMtYTM4MC1hbmQtaXRzLWx1eGUtcmVzaWRlbmNlLXN1aXRlLWFrYmFy?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tony Douglas, CEO of Etihad Aviation Group, said in an interview with The National that the airline’s Airbus A380s may soon become a casualty of the pandemic.

Etihad Airways is the latest airline that’s preparing to say goodbye to the world’s largest passenger jet.

“We have now taken the strategic decision to park the A380s – I’m sure it’s very likely that we won’t see them operating with Etihad again,” Douglas told the publication.

The move is the latest nail in the coffin for the dying aircraft programme and would mean the end of Etihad’s ultra-exclusive cabin, known as The Residence, found only on the A380s. A step above even first class, The Residence is among the pinnacles of luxury travel, offering fliers multi-room flats in the skies. Ticket prices regularly exceeded US$20,000 for a one-way journey, and securing a seat was a bucket-list item for aviation enthusiasts.

Entrepreneurial frequent fliers could also find themselves in the cabin without paying the exorbitant costs. Travel blogger Sam Huang, for example, paid only 60,000 American Airlines AAdvantage miles and US$108 for a US$23,000 flight in the cabin from Abu Dhabi, UAE to Sydney, Australia in 2016.

A ticket for The Residence granted access to the most exclusive areas of the airport including secret areas of Etihad’s newest lounges complete with full bars, sit-down dining and showers, followed by chauffeur service to the departure gate.

The fully-enclosed suites, more comparable to a New York City studio flat than first class on any US carrier, come complete with a sofa, recliner chair, wardrobe, minibar and full vanity mirror. Connected to the suite are a private bedroom and en suite bathroom with its own shower, all on the upper level of the Airbus A380.

Flight attendants serving the cabin are also complemented by a Savoy Hotel-trained butler that roams the cabin, as well as an on board chef to prepare meals. High-end champagne and expensive caviar are frequent choices of well-to-do guests.

Etihad, unlike fellow UAE-based airline Emirates, didn’t invest in having a large fleet of A380s and only operated 10 before the pandemic, serving its top routes to cities including London, New York, Sydney, Paris and Seoul.

The strategy was similar to Middle Eastern rival Qatar Airways, which is also downsizing its A380 fleet as it charts a post-pandemic recovery.

“The A380, I think, is one of the worst aircraft when it comes to emissions that is flying around today,” Akbar Al Baker, group chief executive officer of Qatar Airways, said in January at a Centre for Aviation CAPA Live event, CNN reported.

Qatar Airways has already retired half of its former A380 fleet, also of 10 aircraft primarily used on routes to popular European and Asia-Pacific cities. Both Qatar Airways and Etihad have invested more in twin-engined aircraft like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, Boeing 777X and Airbus A350 XWB over the A380, which served more as a status symbol.

Airbus’ largest passenger jet was among the earliest casualties of the pandemic as airlines struggled to fill the massive cabins. Air France abruptly retired its A380 fleet in May while Lufthansa, Qantas and British Airways have sent their double-decker fleets into storage to ride out the pandemic. Singapore Airlines even turned one of its grounded aircraft into a pop-up restaurant late last year as a way to make money.

Of Lufthansa’s 14 A380s, six are slated for retirement and eight have been “temporarily decommissioned” with little prospects for a return to passenger service, according to the company’s 2020 annual report.

The Boeing 747 was similarly dropped by countless passenger carriers like Virgin Atlantic Airways, British Airways and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. But the 747 proved invaluable to the cargo realm of the industry for carrying everything from personal protective equipment that kept health care workers safe, to home office equipment that fuelled the protracted work-from-home economy.

Portuguese charter airline Hi Fly began flying A380 cargo flights during the pandemic but ultimately parted with the aircraft in 2020 at the end of its lease.

The Airbus A380 entered passenger service at a time when airlines were starting to look for smaller aircraft and the pandemic only accelerated its increasingly short-lived tenure. All Nippon Airways was the last new customer to take delivery of a A380 in 2019, 14 years after the aircraft’s first test flight in 2015.

Emirates is likely to be the last carrier to fly the A380 as the world’s largest operator of the model and has even recently launched a new cabin in a bid to attract customers. Airbus is gearing up for the final delivery, slated for May 2022, and has already trucked the final fuselage to its Toulouse production facility.

Singapore receives its first H225M helicopter - Airbus,"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0wMy1zaW5nYXBvcmUtcmVjZWl2ZXMtaXRzLWZpcnN0LWgyMjVtLWhlbGljb3B0ZXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Singapore, 29 March 2021 – The Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) has taken delivery of its first H225M helicopter in Singapore.

Airbus Helicopters signed a contract with Singapore’s Ministry of Defence for the acquisition of H225M Medium Lift Helicopters in 2016.

Congratulating Singapore on the H225Ms, Airbus Helicopters CEO Bruno Even said: “Airbus is very happy to celebrate this important milestone with the RSAF. This delivery is exceptionally significant as Airbus and the RSAF overcame the COVID-19 pandemic challenges in 2020 to achieve a smooth handover of the helicopter.”

“The RSAF has been a long-term partner of Airbus since its first Aerospatiale SA316B Alouette III entered into service more than 50 years ago. We appreciate the trust Singapore has placed in our helicopters, and we look forward to the H225Ms playing a critical role in the RSAF for many years to come,” added Even.

Singapore’s fleet of H225Ms is expected to assume a wide range of roles, including search and rescue, aeromedical evacuation, as well as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations.

A combat-proven multi-purpose and versatile asset, the H225M enables military forces to deploy wherever and whenever needed. 104 H225Ms are currently in service across the world, having accumulated more than 143,000 flight hours. The H225M is relied upon by Brazil, France, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico Thailand to support their most demanding missions."
