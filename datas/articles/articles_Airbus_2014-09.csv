Airbus facilitates passengers with reduced mobility - Runway Girl Network,"Mon, 22 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTQvMDkvYWlyYnVzLWZhY2lsaXRhdGVzLXBhc3NlbmdlcnMtd2l0aC1yZWR1Y2VkLW1vYmlsaXR5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Using today’s small aircraft lavatories requires even the most physically mobile passengers to be dexterous and flexible. But what do you do if you’re not able to easily squeeze into or navigate your way around those tiny compartments? What about passengers with reduced mobility (PRMs)? We’ve heard some horror stories about PRMs trying to use the lavs on board aircraft, and the indignities they suffer.

Airbus wants to accommodate these passengers. It does so splendidly with its original ‘Space-Flex v1’ configuration for the Airbus A320, which rearranged the footprint of the rear galley by placing the two lavatories together. This not only added three seats (six if a full galley wasn’t necessary), but also catered to PRMs with a retractable partition between the two lavatories. It is currently flying on A320s operated by TAM, LAN, Pegasus, and Loong Air.

The airframer says Space-Flex v2 builds on the in-service experience from Airbus’ Space-Flex v1 as well as market feedback from Zodiac Aerospace’s hugely popular “Innovative Space Interior System”. Thanks to a more optimized centre lavatory design, Space-Flex v2’s enlarged galley area will accommodate up to eight half-size trolleys (or three full-size plus two half-size trolleys), as well as the two lavatories – of which one is PRM capable.

But – and this is a significant “but” – the second iteration is not nearly as PRM-friendly as the first version.

“For Space-Flex v2, the swinging partition separating the two v1 lavatories is replaced by a fixed partition featuring a tip-up seat. The wheelchair bound passenger transfers from the wheelchair to the tip-up seat and then, unassisted, to the toilet seat. So we now have two Space-Flex options. Both maximize the efficiency of space at the back of the A320 Family to allow extra revenue generating seats in the cabin,” says an Airbus spokesman.

He notes that airlines make the ultimate choice.

By combining Space-Flex with reduced aircraft seat pitch, seat count on the A320 can be increased from a current maximum 180 seats to 189. Space-Flex v2 is expected to be introduced in the first quarter of 2016.

The news that aircraft seat pitch will be tightened to accommodate 189-passenger A320s is not new. And it certainly highlights a far broader trend in the industry to fit economy-class cabins with high-density configurations.

Airbus maintains that seats with 18 inches between the armrests can afford to have a smaller pitch, thus allowing for extra seats without sacrificing comfort. The wider cross-section of the A320 accommodates this 18-inch width, a comfort standard that Airbus actively promotes.

A survey conducted by the airframer of approximately 40,000 participants found the majority felt they had more room for their legs and knees when they had 18 inches between armrests. Personally, I too felt quite comfortable in sample seats displayed at Airbus’ booth during last week’s APEX Expo, though it has been pointed out that at 5ft 5in, my knees aren’t exactly “high risk”. It’s also worth noting that as soon as the seats recline, everyone will imaginably be a little unhappier, though some carriers have handily eradicated this problem by not offering reclinable seats on short-haul flights in the first place.

The forthcoming re-engined A321neo will also feature increased seat count, which will be achieved by removing Door 2 and replacing it with two over-wing exits. Combined with Space-Flex v2, seat repitching, slimline seats, increased exit capacity, and Smart-Lav (a new efficient lavatory design) the seat count can be brought up to 240 from 220.

With new passenger space comes the need for more overhead bin space. Confirming a story we broke last year, Airbus has launched a new pivoting bin solution, which allows for 60% more bags. The bins are designed to accommodate eight standard rolling carry-ons across four frames (as opposed to the present five suitcases across four frames). Because more and more passengers are traveling with rolling carry-on luggage, Airbus created bins tall enough for suitcases to be stored on their sides, which will require some passenger reeducation. The move will ensure Airbus can better compete against Boeing, which recently introduced new Space Bins for the 737. Delta is the launch customer of Airbus’ new bins, which are expected to enter service on the carrier in the first quarter of 2016.

Meanwhile, all of these planned changes will equate to more revenue for airlines. Airbus head of aircraft interiors marketing Zuzana Hrnkova says a 1% increase in revenue is equivalent to reducing maintenance costs by 10-11%; rentals, depreciation, and insurance by 8-9%; fuel cost by 4-5%; and cash operating cost by 2-2.5%. That’s certainly good for airlines, but we know that the best news from this announcement is that PRM-friendly lavatories are becoming a fixture on new aircraft. And Airbus and Zodiac will see to it."
Airbus: Maiden flight of A320neo is a success - USA TODAY,"Thu, 25 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTQvMDkvMjUvYWlyYnVzLW1haWRlbi1mbGlnaHQtb2YtYTMyMG5lby1pcy1hLXN1Y2Nlc3MvMTYxOTkzNzMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus: Maiden flight of A320neo is a success

Airbus flew its first-ever flight of its new Airbus A320neo Thursday morning, with the maiden flight of the new aircraft taking off from Toulouse, France, at around noon local time (6 a.m. ET). The flight on the test aircraft lasted more than two hours before returning to Toulouse at 2:22 p.m. local time.

The A320neo flew around southern France, with Airbus saying the test-flight crew ""explored the aircraft's flight envelope and systems operation … while the progress was monitored by experts on the ground in real-time via a direct telemetry link.""

""I congratulate the whole A320neo development team, ground crew and air crew for making this day happen,"" Airbus President and CEO Fabrice Brégier said in a statement at the conclusion of the flight. ""The A320neo which has taken to the air today builds on the outstanding success of the A320 Family. The aircraft through its incremental innovations combines the most efficient engine and aerodynamic technologies, as well as new cabin features to bring to market a product which will consume 20% less fuel per passenger.""

Airbus says Thursday's maiden flight ""marks the beginning of a rigorous flight test campaign involving eight aircraft involving all models"" of the A320 family of aircraft.

So far, Airbus has more than 3,200 orders from more than 60 airlines for planes in its A320neo family of aircraft. Airbus' A320neo family includes the A319neo, A320neo and A321neo variants. The aircraft seat up to 160, 189 and 240 passengers, respectively.

The A320neo is expected to be the first variant in the Airbus' Neo Family to receive type certification and is projected to enter commercial airline service in the fourth quarter of 2015 with launch customer Qatar Airways.

The ""neo"" — short for ""new engine option"" — is Airbus' update of its popular A320 narrowbody jet, used for medium and short-haul flights by carriers across the globe. Aerodynamic improvements, an updated cabin interior and increased fuel efficiency are hallmarks of the modernization program for the A320.

Airbus has received more than 3,000 orders for the A320neo, which officially was launched in 2010. Airbus' decision to modernize the A320 is thought to have been a major factor in pushing Boeing to make its own update to its 737 model, the U.S. jetmaker's competing model to the A320. Boeing finally launched that effort in 2011, dubbing the update the 737 MAX. Delivery to launch customer Southwest is expected in 2017."
A five-Airbus formation flight is as beautiful and crazy as it sounds - The Verge,"Tue, 30 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDE0LzkvMzAvNjg3MzQ3My9hLWZpdmUtYWlyYnVzLWZvcm1hdGlvbi1mbGlnaHQtaXMtYXMtYmVhdXRpZnVsLWFuZC1jcmF6eS1hcy1pdC1zb3VuZHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It isn't often you see airliners flying in formation. There's a good reason for that, of course: they're too busy earning money for the airlines that own them to engage in any sort of photogenic tomfoolery.

Occasionally, though, it all comes together. Airbus is in the midst of launching its A350 XWB, a next-generation hauler that will replace the A330 and A340 while doing battle with Boeing's 777 and 787 Dreamliner. In celebration of achieving certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency — Europe's FAA — it put five A350s in the air at the same time for a once-in-a-lifetime formation flight.

If you look out your window on your next flight to Omaha and see an A350 this close to you, some semblance of alarm is in order. When Airbus does it, though, it's basically the most awesome thing you can do with a five-pack of matching jets.

Airbus files plans for sensory isolation helmets - CNN,"Tue, 16 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLXZpcnR1YWwtcmVhbGl0eS1oZWxtZXRzL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Story highlights Helmets will control what passengers see, hear and smell, according to Airbus patent Incorporated into headrests, the system will also feature mini-airbags to deploy in turbulence No indication when or even if Airbus will go ahead with proposed design

CNN —

It’s either a genius idea for reducing the miseries of long-haul air travel – or an extreme method of distracting passengers from arguments about leg room.

Either way, an Airbus proposal for in-flight virtual reality sensory isolation headgear that controls sights, sounds and even smells experienced by travelers is likely to turn heads – although if the heads are stuck in helmets, there might not be much room for turning.

The European aircraft manufacturer has filed a patent for the headgear which French inventor Bernard Guering says could help alleviate boredom, reduce stress and prevent injury via a mini-airbag system designed to deploy in the event of turbulence.

“During aircraft flights, certain passengers have periods when they are bored either during a wait phase preceding take off or following landing or during a cruise phase,” the patent application says.

“More-over it is known that aircraft flights generate stress for certain passengers.”

‘Odorous substances’

The patent suggests that placing passengers in partial or total “sensorial isolation” by piping audio and video directly into their eyes and ears – and squirting “odorous substances” up their nose – will help make all this go away.

“This isolation allows the passenger to better profit from some of the distractions offered, for example listening to music, watching films,” says the screed attached to the invention blueprints.

Finger food or virtual keyboard? From Airbus

“If the passengers is sensitive to stress, this isolation, possibly associated with one of the above-mentioned activities allows him/her to more easily calm down and relax.”

The helmets, designed to be incorporated into the headrest, will also feature remote controls and technology that projects a virtual reality keyboard on the fold down table, enabling passengers to hammer out emails directly on to the detritus of their in-flight meal.

It’s not known if there are any plans to introduce the helmets in the near future – Airbus hasn’t responded to a CNN query – but it’s likely they’re at the same distant stage as another unusual Airbus patent that proposes cycle saddle-style seating.

It remains to be seen whether sensory isolation can genuinely improve the in-flight experience, but the innovation must surely be a gift to airline staff.

While the eyes of their passengers are helmeted in virtual reality, cabin crew can return to actual reality and relax the mandatory smiles.

Airbus critiques the Boeing 737 MAX 200 - Leeham News and Analysis,"Sun, 21 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNC8wOS8yMS9haXJidXMtY3JpdGlxdWVzLXRoZS1ib2VpbmctNzM3LW1heC0yMDAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With the formal launch by Boeing of the 737 MAX 200, the 200-seat high density version of the 737-8 with an order for 100+100 from Ryanair, Airbus was quick to launch its own critique on the airplane.

Kiran Rao, Executive Vice President, Sales & Marketing for Airbus, was quick to take aim at the advertised seating capacity of the MAX 200 and at the 197 seats Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary says will be in the carrier’s configuration.

In an interview with Leeham News and Comment, Rao said that Boeing has to eliminate too many galley carts, even at reduced food and beverage options, to adequately service passengers. One cart is needed for every 40 passengers.

“The galley on the 189 seat A320 has eight trolleys (carts),” Rao told us. “The 200 seater 737 has only five trolleys. We have spent time optimizing our design as all our customers needed galley space. Up to 30% of low cost carrier revenue comes from ancillary revenue. You don’t get a free meal or drink on an LCC but you can buy one and the margin on sales is greater than the margin selling seats. Hence LCCs need galley space and our A320 with 189 seats is the optimum use of space.”

As we noted last week, the MAX 200, at 200 seats, requires an additional flight attendant. At 199 seats, the additional attendant (and its cost) is not required. O’Leary said his Max 200s would be configured with 197 seats. Rao believes Ryanair ultimately will have to configure for 194 seats because of the trolley requirement to efficiently service the passengers for the ancillary revenue that is the staple of Ryanair’s business model.

O’Leary said the average seat pitch will be 30 inches. Rao disagrees.

“At 200 seats the vast majority of seats are at 28 inch pitch. Even at 194 the seat pitch is 28, as the lost seats are replaced with galley,” he says. “For the A320 at 189 seats, the majority of seats between Door 1 and mid cabin exit are at 30 in pitch. Behind the mid- cabin we are also at 28 in pitch.” He also says that the narrower 17.2 inch wide seat on the 737, compared with the 18-inch wide seat on the A320, had to be offset by seat pitch, which is now more cramped.

Rao doesn’t stop there.

“The MAX 200 max weighs 300 kg more than the 737-8, [resulting in a] 0.3% increase in fuel burn. Will Boeing make the [MAX 200] modification standard? That means 70% of customers will carry 300kg they don’t need. If it’s not standard, 30% of the customers have a sub-fleet.”

Rao also claimed the MAX 200 won’t have enough overhead bin space for the increased passenger capacity, though we might point out that since nearly all LCCs charge for checked baggage, this may not be viewed as a negative.

“The overhead bins on the 737 are already too small,” Rao said. “With 200 passengers, I would not like to be the cabin crew trying to solve the space puzzle.”

Rao said that the A320 189-seat configuration is retrofitable and available now. The MAX 200 is not retrofitable and not available until 2019.

Rao also claims the MAX 200 makes the 737-9 “redundant.”

“The 737-9 is stuck at 215 seats with poor performance and a small customer base,” he says. “The 200 seat 737-8 makes the 215 seat 737-9 redundant. Hence the 737 family will be reduced to one member,” calling the 737-7 a “non-seller.” (There are 55 orders to two customers.) “The A321…goes up to 240 seats vs 189 seats on the A320. There is no aircraft in the world that beats the seat mile cost of a 240 seat A321neo.

“In summary, the nine seat delta today between the 737-8 and the A320 will be reduced to five seats. Our fuel efficiency will make the five seat delta insufficient to cover the delta costs. Hence the A320neo will lead the market for the next decade,” Rao says. “The A321neo is an order of magnitude better than the 737-9…and the sales figures prove it. Boeing is not well positioned in the Single Aisle market.”

Airbus hopes adding seats will lift aircraft sales - Fortune,"Tue, 23 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAxNC8wOS8yMy9haXJidXMtYWRkaW5nLXNlYXRzLWJvb3N0LXNhbGVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It seems aircraft companies have decided that one way to boost sales of commercial airliners is by squeezing more and more seats into their already massive planes.

European aircraft manufacturer Airbus is considering just such an option to improve the disappointing sales numbers of its double-decked A380, already the largest passenger aircraft. Now, the company tells The Financial Times that Airbus does, in fact, plan to increase capacity in the cabin of the A380 from 575 passengers to 600 in an attempt to drive up interest from airlines. “Clearly we will have to win more orders,” Airbus CEO Fabrice Brégier told FT.

The company has only sold around 320 of the A380 (at more than $400 million a pop) since it became available in 2001 after Airbus spent more than $10 billion over a decade to develop the aircraft, according to FT. Airbus did, however, deliver 10 of the planes to Qatar Airways last week and the company is hopeful that the airline will buy more in the future.

This isn’t even the first time this year that Airbus has looked to increase seating capacity on some of its planes. The manufacturer announced in July that it was adding nine seats to its A320ceo model, to increase the total to 189, while also adding 20 seats to its A321neo model to accommodate up to 240 passengers.

Airbus’ move to add more seats to its largest aircraft comes after rival U.S. manufacturer Boeing (BA) landed a major $11 billion order from Irish low-cost airline Ryanair for 100 Boeing 737s, which were also recently redesigned to make room for as many as 200 seats – 11 more than were previously offered, allowing Ryanair to maximize its profit on every flight. That deal came with an option for Ryanair to purchase another 100 planes in the future."

For its trouble Airbus will receive access to Aerion’s proprietary natural laminar flow technology, which could be applied in the designs of future Airbus airliners.

Led by billionaire investor Robert Bass, Aerion for the last several years has sought to engage a certification and manufacturing partner for its proposed supersonic jet, the latest iteration of which is a three-engine design that would be capable of cruising at Mach 1.6 over oceans and sparsely populated regions and at high subsonic speeds over populated areas.

With a projected price tag of $100 million, Aerion predicts there will be no shortage of buyers for the jet, dubbed the AS2, certification of which is targeted for 2021.

While the full details of the collaboration have yet to be revealed, Aerion said its engineering staff will work alongside professionals from Airbus Group’s Space and Defense division at newly expanded offices in Reno, Nevada, where Aerion is based.

The Aerion AS2 was featured in our “Rising Stars: 5 Planes That Will Change Aviation” in our July issue.

Airbus exec Zuzana Hrnkova on making aviation dreams real - Runway Girl Network,"Fri, 19 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTQvMDkvYWlyYnVzLWV4ZWMtenV6YW5hLWhybmtvdmEtb24tbWFraW5nLWF2aWF0aW9uLWRyZWFtcy1yZWFsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Slovakia-born Zuzana Hrnkova first joined the Airbus marketing team in 1994 and has been the head of aircraft interiors marketing for the airframer since 2011. A very busy working mother of two who travels often between Airbus locales in Hamburg and her home base in Toulouse, France, Hrnkova is a hard woman to track down. So, RGN was delighted when Hrnkova agreed to chat with regular contributor Tomás Romero via email and later in person, at this year’s APEX Expo in Anaheim, California for our Lean Into Aviation platform, which highlights the achievements of women in aviation.

Question: Let’s start off with your history. Tell me a little bit about yourself, your background, where you grew up?

Answer: My personal aviation story started very early in [my] native Slovakia, when I was a child. My grandfather … was a pilot so I started flying as [a] hobby, and spent a lot of weekends in the flying club. This passion for aircraft led me to study Aeronautical Engineering in Slovakia and then [also] in France.

Question: Along those same lines, a lot of people I’ve talked to in the industry knew from a very early age that they wanted to work in aviation. Was it like that for you? And do you remember what you wanted to be when you were a little girl?

Answer: I didn’t know exactly what I wanted to do, however, I knew what I [didn’t] want. I didn’t want to be a teacher.

Question: Tell me about your career in aviation? Where did you start out?

Answer: My professional career started in January 1994, when I joined Airbus marketing as a trainee to do my Diploma Thesis from the French School of Civil Aviation in Toulouse. Then in October of 1994 I received a full time contract. This was a big achievement from a young girl [newly] arrived from Eastern Europe.

Question: Definitely! Were there any mentors (male or female) who helped you out along the way?

Answer: During my career I’ve met a lot of fantastic people who supported or inspired me. However I would like to mention some of those who supported me in the important milestones of my professional life: Phillippe Tournaux who offered me a trainee position in 1994 and then Philippe Jarry, who offered me a full time job [at] Airbus.

Question: What’s an average work week like for you? How much time do you spend “in the air” versus at your actual office?

Answer: In my current position, with more leadership and management responsibilities, I’m traveling less than before, however, I’m not spending [much] working time “just in my office”. My working days consist of meetings … with my team in Toulouse or in Hamburg, meetings/workshops with airline customers, in [our] mock-up center, videoconferences, in [our] cabin furnishing center or sometimes with suppliers.

Question: I read somewhere that you have your pilot’s license. Can you talk a little bit about that? Your first solo flight perhaps? Your most memorable flight?

Answer: I did my first solo flight on [a] single engine aircraft in July 1988 in Roudnice nad Labem, a nice aero club close to Prague. I had spent two months flying during summer holiday with my schoolmates [and] the target of this “stay” was to go through basic training, reach 50 flying hours and accomplish a private pilot license at the end of the summer. It was a really great time, we worked very hard but we had all together a lot of fun and went through [some] crazy situations. I have a big smile on my face when I’m remembering it.

My most memorable flights were those I did with my instructor Pepo Kriz – [a] very experienced pilot and also a great professor – when we landed at [the] international airport in Prague and I did all of the exchange[s] with ATC in English, or [my flights] over the Vysoke Tatry mountains. And [my] most stressful [flights] were with my uncle. It is always more difficult to be “teached” by family members. (laughs) But I have to admit that it was also very useful because I learned a lot from him.

Question: Despite the remarkable things women have accomplished in this industry, many people still think of aviation as a traditionally male-dominated industry. What do you think? Is it harder for women to succeed in the world of aviation than men?

Answer: [When] I was a student I realized that the number of girls was very minor, around 15%. When I joined Airbus Marketing in 1994, [the] proportion of women in the division was roughly [the] same. Since then, the proportion of women in our division has more than doubled. And if we look at … my team of 14 people I have [an] equal split of both genders. This balance wasn’t driven by any specific target, it’s the result of [having] the right skills, knowledge and dedication. We can observe [the] same phenomenon in other different companies. So there [are] more and more woman joining the aviation industry.

Question: Have you ever experienced any sexism in the industry?

Answer: Based on my own experience, during my study and working/professional life, I’ve never had any bad experiences. I think it is very important to understand that whoever we are, [you] have a role to play and value to add to this industry. As an employee, I have two “diversity hats”, I’m Slovak and female, and honestly, I believe that my contribution [coming from] a different cultural background and point of view continuously contribute to enriching my working environment.

Question: And finally, what advice would you give to young women looking for a career in aviation? Or even young men for that matter? Why is a career “in the air” still, to paraphrase the old pilot credo, better than anything you can do on the ground?

Answer: Young ladies, young men, [the] aviation industry is offering large opportunities for any kind of profile – from engineers, designers, sales persons, marketers, legal, pilots, communication, for creative or analytical personalities. THE CHOICE IS YOURS! Make your dream reality!"

"Odds and Ends: Delta/Airbus/Zodiac unveil A320 interior; Upgauging narrow-bodies, down-gauging 747s - Leeham News and Analysis","Tue, 16 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL2xlZWhhbW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMTQvMDkvMTYvb2Rkcy1hbmQtZW5kcy1kZWx0YWFpcmJ1c3pvZGlhYy11bnZlaWwtYTMyMC1pbnRlcmlvci11cGdhdWdpbmctbmFycm93LWJvZGllcy1kb3duLWdhdWdpbmctNzQ3cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A320 interior upgrade: After nearly a year of denying a story by Mary Kirby of Runway Girl Network and avoiding our own report from two years ago, Delta Air Lines, Airbus and interior OEM Zodiac revealed a new interior for the A320 family.

The announcement was made at the APEX convention by Airbus. The interior will appear beginning in Q12016, in this case in Delta’s A321ceos.

The overhead bins, which mimic the A350 design, are available for retrofit. Airbus says there is 10% more space compared with today’s bins.

Boeing significantly upgraded the interior of the 737, including pivot bins, announcing the change in 2009. The upgrade was inspired by the 787 and is branded as the Boeing Sky Interior.

Zodiac has designed space-saving lavs and galleys that will also be used for the A320 family. Part of Airbus’ Space-Flex interior option, announced last year, the smaller lavs and galleys allow Airbus to put more seats in the A320 Family: up to 189 in the A320 and up to 240 in the A321.

Upgauging in narrow-bodies: Aviation Week reports that narrow-bodies continue a trend toward larger capacity. AvWeek takes a close look at the shifting sands in the A320/B737 families and how the baby Airbus and Boeing products are showing weak sales and the largest members of the families are picking up steam.

Meanwhile, Boeing 747-400s continue to come out of global fleets in a trend toward down-gauging, Aviation Week reports. The aging 747-400s are being replaced by Boeing 777-300ERs, A350s and eventually 777Xs.

What Makes Airbus A320 the World's Best-Selling Narrow-Body Airplane? - The Motley Fool,"Tue, 09 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy9nZW5lcmFsLzIwMTQvMDkvMDkvd2hhdC1tYWtlcy1haXJidXMtYTMyMC10aGUtd29ybGRzLWJlc3Qtc2VsbGluZy1uYXIuYXNweNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus A320 has been a boon to the European aircraft manufacturer in the single-aisle market, and the company’s going all out to preserve its dominance.

The battle for a greater market share is fierce between aviation stalwarts Airbus (EADSY -3.02%) and Boeing (BA -1.90%). Boeing leads in the wide-body segment, while Airbus is the winner in the narrow-body market. The European aero major forecasts that around 70% (20,242 planes) of the total demand for aircraft over the next two decades will be for the single-aisle variety. So we can expect to see plenty of action there. It'll be interesting to see whether Airbus' A320 can manage to retain its position as the segment leader. Let's uncover what makes it the world's most popular narrow-body plane and find out whether Airbus can maintain its lead in this category.

Hitting the skies

Airbus developed the most successful single-aisle aircraft family in aviation history, the A320, in the 1980s. It's the third plane the company built after the A300 and the A310. Though it had toyed with the idea of making the long-haul A330 or A340 before the A320, it decided on the latter because of the growing popularity of medium-range 130- to 170-seater aircraft.

Building a smaller aircraft involves fewer risks, and any corrections come in much cheaper compared with bigger aircraft. The A320 solidified Airbus' presence in the narrow-body segment and has emerged as the preferred choice of airline operators around the globe. The family includes the game-changing A318, A319, A320, and A321 planes.

Air France was the launch customer of the A320, taking its delivery in March 1988. Since then, the company's delivered 6,171 units and had orders for 4,754 more as of July. In the past 12 years, Airbus dispatched 4,255 units, which made up approximately 78% of its total deliveries. In 2013, the aero major made a record 493 deliveries as demand for fuel-efficient aircraft soared.

Side by side with Boeing 737

A discussion on A320 is incomplete without a comparison with its arch rival. The Boeing 737 arrived in 1968 and was the undisputed narrow-body champion for the next two decades. But things changed after the A320 hit the skies. Boeing started feeling the heat as the 737 kept losing business in the face of strong competition from the A320 that continued outshining the former in terms of size, range, and pricing.

One key reason that Airbus has sold huge numbers in this segment is its popularity in the Asia-Pacific region, where there are bunches of low-cost carriers, or LCCs, that demand more narrow-bodies. The LCCs love the A320 family aircraft, as they offer faster turnarounds because of their spacious aisles, efficient service doors, and larger cargo area, which is easy to access. They also offer the most cabin baggage space in their class.

Airbus' market share in terms of seat capacity has grown phenomenally here, from 2% in 2003 to 25% currently, with Southeast Asia leading at 58%.

""This market heavily partners with Airbus,"" says COO John Leahy. True enough. In 2013, around 82% of the orders placed by Asia-Pacific airlines (68% in terms of value) came to Airbus. And this region is expected to flourish massively, driving future growth. Airbus estimates the Asia-Pacific region will absorb more than 33% of single-aisle deliveries in the next 20 years.

Raising the successor to the throne

While Airbus is constantly on its toes to maintain its narrow-body lead, Boeing is equally energized to bridge the gap. So the two giants are reengineering their smaller workhorses.

In December 2010, Airbus announced the A320neo program. Offering both CFM International's LEAP-X and Pratt & Whitney's PurePower PW1100G engines, the modified aircraft would offer 16% better fuel consumption and cut carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions.

Every action in a duopoly sees an instant reaction. James F. Albaugh, former CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, originally said the company intends to build an all-new aircraft by 2020, though it eventually took to reengineering the 737. In August 2011, Boeing declared that it planned to add new engines to the 737 successor and called the derivative plane the 737Max. Boeing claims that the plane, powered by LEAP-1B engines, would save 14% on fuel and lower carbon dioxide emission.

Airlines around the globe eagerly await both of the narrow-body planes, but A320neo has established a lead over 737Max. Orders for A320neo run over 3,000 units, with the plane scheduled to enter service in 2015, a couple of years before the 737 Max. Boeing 737Max is bucking up with firm orders for more than 2,100 planes.

Last word

Airbus and Boeing are fighting it out with their bleeding-edge technology. In the long term, the market has enough demand to absorb the duo's offerings, but it would be interesting to see how the two stack up against each other in this battle of narrow-bodies. Though it's too early to say who will emerge as the leader over the coming years, Airbus definitely has the first mover's advantage with the A320neo."
Airbus Defense and Space helps secure Saudi border - UPI News,"Tue, 23 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVwaS5jb20vRGVmZW5zZS1OZXdzLzIwMTQvMDkvMjMvQWlyYnVzLVNhdWRpLUFyYWJpYS1maW5pc2gtTm9ydGhlcm4tQm9yZGVyLVNlY3VyaXR5LXByb2plY3QvODMxMTQxMTQ5MDIyMy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"UNTERSCHLEISSHEIM, Germany, Sept. 23 (UPI) -- The final stage of a program to help secure Saudi Arabia's border with Iraq has been officially inaugurated.

Airbus Defense and Space, working with its civil works partner, was the principle contractor for the Northern Border Project that covers about 559 miles of frontier.

""I am proud to be responsible of this final stage of the project and to see all our years of hard work and technical know-how finally culminating in this inauguration of our state-of-the art border security system,"" said Project Director Dietmar Pilz.

The Northern Border Project, part of the Saudi Border Guard Development Program, consists of one sand berm, three fences, seven command-and-control centers, and 32 response stations.

About 240 response vehicles and 10 surveillance and reconnaissance vehicles are also being used, Airbus said.

Surveillance towers -- 40 in all -- equipped with Airbus DS TRGS-SEC radars and day/night cameras; and 38 communication towers are connected to the command-and-control centers and the Ministry of Interior through fiber-optic cable.

""These assets, combined, provide superior operational awareness and means to mitigate and monitor threats of all nature,"" Airbus Defense and Space said."
Airbus A320neo first flight - DW (English),"Thu, 25 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR3LmNvbS9lbi9mYXN0LXNlbGxpbmctYWlyYnVzLWEzMjBuZW8tY29tcGxldGVzLW1haWRlbi1mbGlnaHQvYS0xNzk1NjA2ONIBVGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmR3LmNvbS9lbi9mYXN0LXNlbGxpbmctYWlyYnVzLWEzMjBuZW8tY29tcGxldGVzLW1haWRlbi1mbGlnaHQvYS0xNzk1NjA2OA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The bulk of global airline routes are short- and medium-range intercity flights, and ever more people are flying. That's why medium-range single-aisle jets like Airbus's new A320neo sell like hotcakes.

Airbus sent its new-model single-aisle medium-range A320neo into the skies above Toulouse in southwest France for two hours on Thursday for the aircraft's first test flight.

The company has already taken orders from 60 airlines for a total of 3,257 new A320neos, Airbus chief operating officer for customers John Leahy told reporters.

It's a remarkable sales figure, given that not a single A320neo has been delivered yet. Airbus first began producing the aircraft's predecessor, the popular A320, in 1986, and has built and delivered about 6,200 A320s in the 28 years since then.

Smoother, quieter, more efficient

The A320neo is a revamped version of Airbus's long-established flagship A320 line of short- to medium-range narrow-body commercial passenger jet airliners.

The 'neo' in A320neo stands for 'new engine option'. Airlines will be able to choose between two different new, more fuel-efficient, quieter engines.

'Sharklet' winglets at the tips of the aircraft's wings, aerodynamic improvements, and weight reductions also contribute to the A320neo's enhanced fuel efficiency. Taken together, the improvements mean the A320neo will burn 20 percent less fuel per seat compared to the previous A320, according to a company statement.

The changes also mean lower emissions, and an increase in flight range of about 500 nautical miles (926 kilometers, or 575 miles).

Inside the aircraft, the A320neo features a new cabin with larger luggage spaces and an improved air purification system compared to the previous A320.

Airbus versus Boeing: a perennial contest

Airbus says its A320neo presently has a 60 percent market share - measured in firm advance orders - compared to the aircraft's direct competitor, the Boeing 737 MAX. The first deliveries of B737 MAX aircraft are scheduled for 2017. In contrast, Airbus expects to deliver its first A320neos to customers in late 2015.

The B737 MAX is an updated iteration of Boeing's 737 line of aircraft. It features new engines, a new wingtip device, and other changes to improve aerodynamics - in short, very much the same sort of changes Airbus made to its A320 line.

The duopolistic competition between the two great commercial aircraft makers, Europe-based Airbus and US-based Boeing, is a boon for customers. Neither company can rest on its laurels technologically, and neither can get away with overpricing.

A320neo: An arrow aimed at the heart of a growing market

Airbus released fresh forecasts on Wednesday that project robust sales over the next twenty years, as dynamic economies in Asia drive air travel to new heights. The company projects a global rate of growth of 4.7 percent in air travel from 2014 through 2033, generating a need for 31,400 new aircraft worth 3.6 trillion euros ($4.6 trillion).

""Aviation is growing impressively and our latest forecast confirms its long term growth,"" Leahy said.

Boeing's 737 MAX will compete directly with the Airbus A320neo for medium-range airline routes Image: picture-alliance/dpa

The A320neo, which has room for up to 180 passengers, promises to be a strong seller for Airbus in coming years. Most of the forecasted increase in air travel demand will be in the medium-range single-aisle aircraft segment.

In the medium-range segment, Airbus forecasts demand over the next 20 years for more than 22,000 new aircraft worth $2.1 trillion - or 70 percent of all new airliner sales, and 45 percent of the value of total deliveries for all the commercial airliner sector.

Airbus hopes to grab as large a proportion of that total as possible - but as ever, it will have to contend with its perennial rival Boeing for customers."
Will More Seats Help the Airbus A380 Pay Back Its Development Cost? - 24/7 Wall St.,"Wed, 24 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vMjQ3d2FsbHN0LmNvbS9hZXJvc3BhY2UtZGVmZW5zZS8yMDE0LzA5LzI0L3dpbGwtbW9yZS1zZWF0cy1oZWxwLXRoZS1haXJidXMtYTM4MC1wYXktYmFjay1pdHMtZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQtY29zdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Will More Seats Help the Airbus A380 Pay Back Its Development Cost?

The A380 from Airbus took 10 years to develop at a cost of approximately $25 billion. The company has delivered just 139 of the gigantic planes since the first one was sent to Singapore Airlines in October of 2007. Airbus has taken orders for a total of 318 of the planes, and, as we noted earlier this week, the largest customer for the plane is Emirates, which currently has 52 of the list-priced $414.4 million planes in its fleet out of an order total of 140.

But while Emirates wants Airbus to add more fuel-efficient engines to the plane, Airbus’s commercial division CEO, Fabrice Brégier, is working on adding more seats to the existing plane. An A380-900 configured as an all-economy class plane can carry 900 passengers. The current average configuration for the plane includes 575 seats in three classes (first, business and economy). Airbus is looking to increase that to 600 seats.

Emirates has pledged to order at least another 60 A380s if Airbus will put new, more fuel-efficient engines on the plane. As it is, the current A380 has been called a “costly, four-engine fuel hog” and one aerospace analyst described the plane this way:

It’s a commercial disaster. Every conceivably bad idea that anyone’s ever had about the aviation industry is embodied in this airplane.

According to the Financial Times, it is unlikely that the A380 will ever return all its development costs. Brégier told the Times, “I won’t be CEO any more [when that happens].” The company has already written off a large part of the plane’s development costs, a move that Brégier described as “an investment.”

While the plane may never be profitable, it is not getting a lot of competition from the 747-8, the other jumbo jet made by Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA). And Boeing has no plans to make any modifications or improvements to its four-engine jet. Boeing’s order book for the 747-8 shows just 28 orders for the commercial version and 18 for the 747-8F freighter version.

The Boeing 787’s development cost has been estimated at north of $30 billion, and we’ve written before about rumored steep discounts to the list price of $218.3 million for a 787-8 and $257.1 million for the larger 787-9.

The A380 has been discounted as much as 50% on its $400 million+ list price, according to some analysts. Every one that Airbus sells increases its “investment.” The A380 is one of those things that probably won’t go on forever because it can’t. Will Boeing’s 787 be another?

Airbus satellite bracket production optimised by Additive Manufacturing - Metal Additive Manufacturing magazine,"Tue, 09 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ldGFsLWFtLmNvbS9haXJidXMtc2F0ZWxsaXRlLWJyYWNrZXQtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1vcHRpbWlzZWQtYnktYWRkaXRpdmUtbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Share to your network:









Airbus Defence and Space is using Additive Manufacturing equipment from EOS to produce satellite retaining brackets at its Competence Centre for Composite Materials in Madrid, Spain.

with the carbon fibre panel of the reflectors and



feeder facilities at the upper end (Courtesy EOS)



The current generation of satellites include metal brackets that serve as a link between the body of a satellite and the carbon fibre reflectors and feed array mounted at the upper end. The brackets must fix securely to the satellite body and withstand high thermal stresses caused by extreme temperature fluctuations in space, ranging from -180°C to +150°C.

Titanium is preferable for such applications due to its thermal conductivity properties and high strength-to-weight ratio. The latter is especially important, as every kilogram carried into space costs many thousands of dollars, often running into six figures depending on the carrier system and the orbit to be reached.

Brackets manufactured by conventional metal cutting did not meet the requirements of Airbus Defence and Space, as design limitations prevented optimisation of the weight of the component and the stresses.

Additive manufacturing technology was selected as an alternative production method. The bracket is built up from successive layers of metal powder that are melted and hardened by a laser beam driven by data that originates from the CAD model of the part. Titanium is still usable as a tried and tested material and the process allows the design of components to be adapted easily.

“Additive manufacture has two main advantages. We are not only able to optimise the design of parts but can also produce them in one piece,” stated Otilia Castro Matías, who is responsible for antennae at Airbus Defence and Space in Madrid. “When the precision workpiece is complete, no excess material remains except for raw titanium powder that can be reused in our EOSINT M 280.”

The new devices meet all expectations of the experts involved. Most important of all is the improved temperature resistance of the entire structure, which now can easily and permanently withstand a 330°C temperature variation under a force of 20 kN. In addition, production time for the three brackets required for each satellite has been reduced by five days to less than one month.

“Thanks to Additive Manufacturing, we were able to redesign the bracket and eliminate the vulnerability caused by thermal stress at the interface with the carbon fibre panel. The improvements also significantly reduced thermally induced failure during the qualification test campaign. The cost of space activities is relatively high, so it is especially important to protect any hardware from possible failure,” added Matías.

The European Space Agency (ESA) has also supported this program, the successful completion of which allows further use of this efficient production technology in the field of aerospace.

“Additive Manufacturing brought measurable benefits to critical aspects of the project without requiring cuts to be made elsewhere, so there were no compromises – something engineers don’t get to hear very often. In addition, cost savings in bracket production amounted to more than 20% and the weight was reduced by about 300 g, which means a saving of nearly one kg per satellite.”

Airbus Defence and Space, a division of Airbus Group, was formed on 1st January 2014 by combining the business activities of Cassidian, Astrium and Airbus Military. The new division is Europe’s number one defence and space enterprise and the second largest space business worldwide.

Present for the signing were Romanian prime minister Victor Viorel Ponta; vice prime minister, minister of internal affairs Gabriel Oprea; minister of national defense Mircea Dusa; minister of economy Constantin Nita; minister of finance Maria Petrescu; Airbus Helicopters president Guillaume Faury; and Jean-Louis Mascle, general executive director of Eurocopter Romania.

The ceremony underscored the commitment to build on the shared history of success and to confirm Airbus Helicopters’ presence in the country for future decades. Today’s memorandum paves the way for Airbus Helicopters to extend here in Romania, our activities and further develop our production capabilities for the Super Puma MK1 helicopter at Brasov Aerospace Technological Park.

With more than 300 Puma and Alouette helicopters (IAR330 and IAR316) produced under license in the 1970s for national and export markets, Airbus Helicopters has enjoyed a longstanding partnership with the Government of Romania. The helicopter manufacturer’s presence in Brasov dates to 2002 through Eurocopter Romania, a joint venture with the state-owned company Industria Aeronautica Romana (now IAR S.A. Brasov).

More than 170 highly skilled employees perform major inspections and repairs of Pumas and Super Pumas, as well as work on maintenance export contracts. In 2012, the United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence took possession of its first upgraded Puma Mk1 as part of the Puma Life Extension Program (LEP) contract awarded to Eurocopter UK in 2009 which upgrades Mk1 helicopters to Mk2. The three-year support contract affects a fleet of 24 Royal Air Force Puma Mk1 helicopters being upgraded at Brasov to extend their life, and enhance performance, mission capability and operational safety. In addition, Airbus Helicopters aircraft perform missions for several Romanian State institutions, including the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Interior, and the Intelligence Service Agency (SRI).

Eurocopter Romania’s strides in developing cost-effective solutions to maintain and retrofit the workhorse Puma helicopter have been driven by the excellence of its workforce, and have earned global recognition for the Romanian facility, with achievements that have made the Brasov customer center a reference and success story in the production and overhaul of Pumas. With today’s memorandum, Airbus Helicopters hopes to benefit from this industrial capacity in its evaluation of development options for its family of twin-engine medium helicopters."
Airbus A320neo completes its first flight - Economy Class & Beyond - Kevin Marshall,"Fri, 26 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vZWNvbm9teWNsYXNzYW5kYmV5b25kLmJvYXJkaW5nYXJlYS5jb20vMjAxNC8wOS8yNi9haXJidXMtYTMyMG5lby1jb21wbGV0ZXMtZmlyc3QtZmxpZ2h0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus have been working away with their updated version of their narrowbody aircraft – the Airbus A320neo.

The new version of the Airbus A320neo entered assembly in March, and rolled out in July.

Yesterday, the new aircraft (registered as F-WNEO, frame MSN6101),it took its first flight into the skies to begin the test and certification campaign.





During take-off



Air-to-Air



All images, Airbus

The A320neo completed a two hour twenty-two minute sortie across southern France, beginning a 3000 hour flight test programme.

For the first flight of the A320neo, the aircraft was fitted with Pratt & Whitney “PurePower” PW1100G-JM engines (which look big in comparison to the engines on a normal A320). In addition, the A320neo is fitted with sharklets and other aerodynamic improvements.

Future aircraft will be offered with the CFM International’s LEAP-1A engine as an option.

In total, eight aircraft will form the cadre of test aircraft made up of:

Four A320neo’s (two using Pratt and Whitney Pure Power, two using CFM Leap 1A)

Two A321neo’s (one using Pratt and Whitney Pure Power, one using CFM Leap 1A)

Two A319neo (one using Pratt and Whitney Pure Power, one using CFM Leap 1A)

Why is this important? Fuel efficiency. With airline fuel still a major cost and forming a lot of the bill to fly a plane around, anything to reduce costs would be welcome to airlines to keep fares low, or to increase profits.

The A320neo is a very anticipated aircraft, with orders of 3257 aircraft from 60 customers. The launch customer of the Airbus A320neo will be Qatar Airways (also the launch customer of the Airbus A350) towards the end of 2015.

It may not be a totally new innovation in terms of aircraft design, but as the market moves towards incremental updates – updated designs that save airlines money can only be good news for those of us who pay for tickets out of our own pockets.

British Airways to fly its Airbus A380s to San Francisco - USA TODAY,"Mon, 15 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTQvMDkvMTUvYnJpdGlzaC1haXJ3YXlzLXRvLWZseS1pdHMtYWlyYnVzLWEzODBzLXRvLXNhbi1mcmFuY2lzY28vMTU2NDAxOTEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"British Airways to fly its Airbus A380s to San Francisco

British Airways will use its Airbus A380 superjumbo jets on about a third of flights between San Francisco and London Heathrow this summer.

British Airways currently flies twice daily on the route, using Boeing 747-400 aircraft for its 14 weekly round-trip flights. But starting April 2, BA will switch to A380s on five of those flights. The change is scheduled to last throughout the summer travel season.

British Airways says Flight 286 from San Francisco to London will be operated with A380s on Mondays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. The carrier will continue to use 747s for Flight 286's Tuesday and Wednesday schedule. The return from London operating with the A380 will fly as BA Flight 287, featuring A380 service on the same days.

British Airways' A380s can hold 469 passengers, including 14 suites in first class and 97 in its Club World business-class section. Seats in both sections recline into a fully flat position, leading BA to claims its A380s ""will have more full flatbeds than any other flight departing from San Francisco."" United and Virgin Atlantic also fly nonstop between San Francisco and London Heathrow.

Elsewhere, BA's A380s offer 55 premium economy seats and 303 in regular coach.

""I'm delighted that British Airways customers in the Bay area will be able to experience one of the newest and most advanced aircraft in our fleet,"" Sean Doyle, British Airways' Executive Vice President–Americas, says in a statement. ""I believe the extensive inflight entertainment options and expansive, comfortable cabins will be a big hit with our frequent fliers.""

BA's second daily San Francisco-London route — operating as Flight 284 to London and Flight 285 to San Francisco — will continue to be on 747s.

British Airways has ordered 12 A380 aircraft, touting the order as part of an $8 billion program to invest ""in new aircraft, smarter cabins, elegant lounges, and new technologies to make life more comfortable in the air and on the ground."" BA expects to take the last of its A380s in 2016.

BA currently uses A380s on its routes between London and Los Angeles, Hong Kong and Johannesburg. Next month, British Airways will begin using the aircraft on its flights to Washington Dulles (starting Oct. 2) and to Singapore (starting Oct. 28)."
Airbus's A350-900 superjumbo ready to fly after receiving Euorpean safety clearance - RFI English,"Tue, 30 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJmaS5mci9lbi92aXNpdGluZy1mcmFuY2UvMjAxNDA5MzAtYWlyYnVzLXMtYTM1MC05MDAtc3VwZXJqdW1iby1yZWFkeS1mbHktYWZ0ZXItcmVjZWl2aW5nLWV1b3JwZWFuLXNhZmV0eS1jbGVh0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"European Union - France

European aircraft builder Airbus has received EU safety clearance for its huge new long-haul superjumbo jet, meaning that the A350-900 can now take off in competition with Boeing’s Dreamliner.

The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) on Tuesday issued a type certificate for the A350-900, declaring that “the aircraft complies with the regulatory safety and environment requirements defined by EASA for the European Union”.

The ultra-modern Airbus A350-900, which is equipped with Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines, can carry 315 passengers for up to 14,500 kilometres.

It can now be delivered to its first buyer, Qatar Airways.

Airbus invested 10-12 billion euros in the project in an attempt to compete with US rival Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner and its 777.

In mid-August Airbus announced that the A350-900 had finished its “route proving” by flying around the world in 20 days under real flight conditions.

It travelled 151,300 kilometres, flew for 180 hours and touched down in 14 airports.

In 14 months of tests the A350-900 notched up 2,600 hours in flight.

""We dealt with a very mature aircraft,” EASA Executive Director Patrick Ky said in a statement. “Airbus and EASA have learnt from experience and have established pragmatic working methods which have proved to be the recipe for the successful type certification and the way forward for future certification programmes. I wish a long and safe journey to the A350 programme throughout its life in service"".

Airbus’s largest factory is in Toulouse in the south of France.

First look: Etihad shows off new paint scheme on its A380 - USA TODAY,"Thu, 25 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTQvMDkvMjUvZmlyc3QtbG9vay1ldGloYWQtc2hvd3Mtb2ZmLW5ldy1wYWludC1zY2hlbWUtb24taXRzLWEzODAvMTYyMTIwNzcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"First look: Etihad shows off new paint scheme on its A380

Etihad Airways unveiled a new paint scheme for its aircraft today, showing off the design for the first time at an Airbus production facility near Hamburg, Germany.

The Abu Dhabi-based airline showed off the livery – which it dubs ""Facets of Abu Dhabi"" – on the first Airbus A380 superjumbo jet to join its fleet.

""Only a few months ago Etihad Airways unveiled the new cabin interiors for our A380 aircraft and we are now proud to show the world how this aircraft will look on the outside,"" Etihad CEO James Hogan says in a statement detailing the new paint scheme. ""The striking new livery also continues our commitment to breaking from convention and doing things differently. This is a real divergence from the norms of traditional airline livery design and will stand out in the sky and at every airport we fly to.""

Etihad is also set to unveil its first Boeing 787 Dreamliner this Saturday (Sept. 27) at Boeing's production line in Everett, Wash. That aircraft also will debut with Etihad's new paint scheme.

Etihad says its new ""Facets of Abu Dhabi"" paint scheme ""uses a color palette which reflects the varying hues of the landscape of the UAE (United Arab Emirates)."" Additionally, Etihad says, the new look gives the national emblem of the UAE ""prominence along the fuselage next to the Etihad name and the national flag is respectfully featured forward near the cockpit.""

Etihad says all of its new aircraft will arrive in the new paint scheme. Existing aircraft will be repainted, with all of Etihad's fleet of more than 100 aircraft expected to have the new look within three years.

Although unrelated, Etihad's redesign comes after three U.S. carriers have unveiled their own new liveries during the past three weeks.

Southwest was first, unveiling its new ""Heart"" logo and paint scheme on Sept. 8. The look is Southwest's first change to its aircraft since 2001, when it adopted the Canyon Blue scheme that the Heart livery will replace.

Frontier followed with its own new look a day later, rolling out a different paint scheme for its planes on Sept. 9. Like Southwest, Frontier's new livery was more update than an overhaul, with the airline opting to keep its signature animals on the tails of its aircraft. But the airline also moved to add touches that pay homage to a previous version of Frontier Airlines that launched in 1950 and ceased flying in 1986.

And then on Sept. 15, Spirit Airlines became the third U.S. carrier to unveil a new image. Unlike both Southwest and Frontier, Spirit's new look was both a well-kept secret and a dramatic change. Spirit went with a bright yellow and black paint scheme, replacing its current look that features a mostly white fuselage with blue lettering and a multi-colored tail logo."

Powered by a pair of Pratt & Whitney PurePower PW1100G-JM engines, the aircraft flew for 2.5 hours performing initial system checks and began the process of expanding the flight and performance envelope, reaching a maximum altitude of 26,500 feet. The airplane will also be offered with CFM International’s LEAP-1A engine as part of a drive to develop the most fuel-efficient aircraft possible. The design includes Sharklet winglets to improve range and efficiency. Airbus said the NEO promises innovative new cabin equipment, fixtures and seat designs, although the company’s release did not specify whether seating was going include the semi-standing, bicycle saddle-style seats for which Airbus recently filed a patent application.

In its announcement about the flight, Airbus said that the flight “kicks off Airbus’ NEO flight test and certification programme, which will include some 3000 flight hours across eight aircraft-a fleet comprising two A320neos, one A321neo and one A319neo for each engine type.” The test program is intended to lead to the A320neo’s entry into service with Qatar Airways in the fourth quarter of 2015. Airbus said that with the offered engine options, its NEO jets are to bring 15 percent fuel burn savings per seat by the time of entry into airline service, which, with additional enhancements, will increase to 20 percent by 2020. Airbus has received more than 3200 orders from 60 customers for the NEO family of jets."

Qatar Airways took delivery of its first A380 super-jumbo jet from Airbus on Wednesday. The Middle Eastern airline has ordered a total of 10 of the planes and expects to receive four by the end of the year. The airline also has an option on three additional A380s.

The A380 seats 517 passengers on twin decks and is configured to accommodate eight first-class passengers, 48 business-class passengers and 461 economy-class travelers.

The A380 will join 43 A320-family jets and 33 A330/340 family jets in Qatar’s commercial fleet. The airlines also flies 35 of Boeing Co.’s (NYSE: BA) 777-200/300 jets and 14 787-8 Dreamliners. The airline’s website indicates that it has unfilled orders for one additional A320, 80 of the new A320neo jets, 80 of the A350 planes and 13 A380s (which includes the options).

In an interview last March in Paris, the airline’s CEO Akbar Al Baker said that Qatar Airways will not use the A380 on “ultra-long haul” flights because the plane is very expensive to operate on that type of flight. Also in March the airline was expecting to receive its first three A380s in June and to begin service to London.

Qatar Airways is Airbus’s world launch customer for the A350 XWB, which is expected to be delivered before the end of this year. The airline also has orders on Boeing for 100 of the 777X and 46 more of the company’s 787-8 Dreamliners.

The new aircraft, which is based at Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton, Ohio, joins CareFlight’s all-Dauphin fleet of four air medical transport helicopters.

“We have a lot of confidence in the Dauphin,” said Candy Skidmore, Premier Health vice president, Emergency, Trauma, and CareFlight. “We’ve been operating Dauphins for 25 years and we’ve had good reliability.”

The AS365 N3+, sold by Airbus Helicopters Inc. (AHI), of Grand Prairie, Texas, met the key criteria CareFlight established for selection of a new aircraft, including speed, twin engines, single pilot IFR and night vision capability. The new Dauphin’s cabin size accommodates the needs of pilot, crew and patients. The AS365 N3+ was completed with an air medical transport equipment package by Metro Aviation, of Shreveport, La.

“We are really excited to get our new aircraft,” said Skidmore. “We went back and looked at other aircraft again, all the usual suspects, before selecting the Dauphin. The speed is very important to us and we like the 4-axis autopilot system to reduce the pilot’s workload. I also like the safety of the Fenestron, as opposed to the open tail rotor. Anything we can do to enhance safety is a plus.”

“Airbus Helicopters Inc. is pleased that CareFlight, after reviewing the alternatives, has again selected an Airbus Helicopters Dauphin to carry out its vital, life-saving emergency medical services (EMS) and other medical transport missions,” said Treg Manning, Airbus Helicopters Inc. vice president, Sales & Marketing. “All of us at AHI are proud that CareFlight has entrusted our company to provide their aircraft and follow up support.”

Miami Valley Hospital is a division of Premier Health, which operates five hospitals in southwest Ohio. CareFlight provides service to areas within about a 150-mile radius from Dayton. Each of CareFlight’s four Dauphin helicopters is equipped as a mobile ICU with the latest in emergency medical care technology and the most advanced communication equipment available. Since its beginning in 1983, CareFlight has completed more than 74,000 flights.

CareFlight helicopters are operated and maintained by Air Methods Corp., and the program is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Medical Transport Systems (CAMTS).

The AS365 N3+ is a fast and powerful helicopter offering operators an outstanding useful load, excellent performance and long range. The AS365 N3+ features more powerful turboshaft engines and increased gross weight, plus a glass cockpit and 4-axis autopilot.

Airbus Helicopters Inc. is the leading U.S. provider of new helicopters for air medical transport and EMS missions with a 75 percent market share over the last decade. The company’s industry leading product range includes high performance single-engine, light twin-engine and medium twin-engine aircraft.

It is a modernized version of the CH-47 Chinook and its primary role is the transportation of troops, vehicles and cargo. The Huron exists in two variants: the armed variant with two side gunners manning 6.5 mm gatling guns, and the transport version which replaces the gunners with two additional passenger positions.







The Mi-290 Taru is a heavy utility helicopter with coaxial rotors and a unique modular construction. Various mission pods allow the Taru to serve many different roles. It can transport cargo, troops, and provide battlefield supplies (ammunition, fuel, repair facilities, and medical equipment). The helicopter can also transport light vehicles thanks to its sling loading capabilities. The latter, sling loading, is a brand new feature in Arma 3, and will be demonstrated in the official Sling Loading showcase scenario, which is included in the Helicopters DLC package.



Overall, the addition of the two new helicopters and their skin variants will place a stronger emphasis on the role of logistics in Arma 3's open-world combat. This idea is complemented by the upcoming Arma 3 platform update, which delivers a variety of free new playable content, alongside multiple game-changing features.



In terms of content, the Arma 3 platform update will ship the brand new Support multiplayer mode, where players will need to provide various types of helicopter support, such as troop transport and medevac in Sector Control multiplayer scenarios. In addition, the update will include a set of ten VR Training helicopter stages, and five helicopter Time Trials, of which four will be exclusive to Helicopters DLC owners. A variety of new in-game objects, ranging from landing platforms to military decorations and more, will also be made available to Arma 3 content creators. Plus, Bohemia Interactive will add a related set of new Steam Achievements to the game.



With regards to the new features, the Arma 3 platform update comes with the optional RotorLib helicopter flight model, which is an upgraded version of the flight model used in Bohemia Interactive's Take On Helicopters. Furthermore, the platform update will include the aforementioned new ability to sling load cargo, and last but certainly not least: the much-anticipated firing-from-vehicles feature. This functionality enables vehicle passengers to fire their weapon while seated.

The Arma 3 Helicopters DLC will be available on November 4th for 12.99 EUR/10.99 GBP/15.99 USD on Steam and Store.bistudio.com. People can already purchase the Arma 3 DLC Bundle, which includes the Arma 3 Karts, Arma 3 Helicopters, and the upcoming Arma 3 Marksmen DLC, for 19.99 EUR/16.99 GBP/24.99 USD on Steam and Store.bistudio.com. As a result of Bohemia Interactive's new approach to DLC in Arma 3, which the studio announced in May, players will be able to try out all new DLC content before buying.

Should Airplanes Be Flying Themselves? - Vanity Fair,"Wed, 17 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbml0eWZhaXIuY29tL25ld3MvYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAxNC8xMC9haXItZnJhbmNlLWZsaWdodC00NDctY3Jhc2jSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bonin said, “What is it? How is it that we’re continuing to descend so deeply?”

Robert directed Captain Dubois to the overhead switching panel. He said, “Try to see what you can do with your controls up there! The primaries, etc.”

Dubois said, “It won’t do anything.”

Bonin said, “We’re getting to level 100!” Four seconds later he said, “Nine thousand feet!” He was struggling to keep the wings level.

Dubois said, “Easy on the rudder.”

Robert said, “Climb, climb, climb, climb!” He meant, Pitch up!

Bonin said, “But I’ve been at full-back stick for a while!” DUAL INPUT.

Dubois said, “No, no, no! Do not climb!” He meant, Do not pitch up!

Robert said, “So go down!” DUAL INPUT.

Bonin said, “Go ahead—you have the controls. We are still in TOGA, eh.” Someone said, “Gentlemen . . . ” Otherwise, for the next 13 seconds none of them spoke. Count it on a clock. Robert was doing the flying. The cockpit was lousy with automated warnings.

Dubois said, “Watch out—you’re pitching up there.”

Robert said, “I’m pitching up?”

“You’re pitching up.”

Bonin said, “Well, we need to! We are at 4,000 feet!” But pitching up is what had gotten them into trouble to start with. The ground-proximity warning system sounded. A synthetic voice said, SINK RATE. PULL UP.

Dubois said, “Go on, pull.” With that, it seems, he had resigned himself to death.

Bonin was younger. He had a wife in the back and two little children at home. He assumed control, saying, “Let’s go! Pull up, pull up, pull up!”

Robert said, “Fuck, we’re going to crash! It’s not true! But what’s happening?”

In sequence the alarms were sounding PULL UP, C-chord, STALL, C-chord, PULL UP, PRIORITY RIGHT. At the same time either Robert or Bonin said, “Fuck, we’re dead.”

Dubois calmly said, “Ten degrees pitch.”

Thousand one, thousand two. Flight 447 then pancaked into the equatorial Atlantic. The time in Rio was 11:14 P.M., 4 hours and 15 minutes into the flight, and 4 minutes and 20 seconds into the upset. Two years later, when the flight-data recorder was retrieved, it showed that by the last moment the airplane had turned 225 degrees off course and was flying due west with its nose 16 degrees up and its wings nearly level; thoroughly stalled, it was progressing at merely 107 knots, but with a descent rate, despite full thrust, of 11,000 feet per minute. The impact was shattering. Everyone aboard died instantly, and the wreckage sank in deep water. In the small debris field soon found floating on the surface lay 50 bodies, including that of Captain Marc Dubois.

VI. Brave New World

For commercial-jet designers, there are some immutable facts of life. It is crucial that your airplanes be flown safely and as cheaply as possible within the constraints of wind and weather. Once the questions of aircraft performance and reliability have been resolved, you are left to face the most difficult thing, which is the actions of pilots. There are more than 300,000 commercial-airline pilots in the world, of every culture. They work for hundreds of airlines in the privacy of cockpits, where their behavior is difficult to monitor. Some of the pilots are superb, but most are average, and a few are simply bad. To make matters worse, with the exception of the best, all of them think they are better than they are. Airbus has made extensive studies that show this to be true. The problem in the real world is that the pilots who crash your airplanes or simply burn too much fuel are difficult to spot in the crowd. A Boeing engineer gave me his perspective on this. He said, “Look, pilots are like other people. Some are heroic under pressure, and some duck and run. Either way, it’s hard to tell in advance. You almost need a war to find out.” But of course you can’t have a war to find out. Instead, what you do is try to insert your thinking into the cockpit.

First, you put the Clipper Skipper out to pasture, because he has the unilateral power to screw things up. You replace him with a teamwork concept—call it Crew Resource Management—that encourages checks and balances and requires pilots to take turns at flying. Now it takes two to screw things up. Next you automate the component systems so they require minimal human intervention, and you integrate them into a self-monitoring robotic whole. You throw in buckets of redundancy. You add flightmanagement computers into which flight paths can be programmed on the ground, and you link them to autopilots capable of handling the airplane from the takeoff through the rollout after landing. You design deeply considered minimalistic cockpits that encourage teamwork by their very nature, offer excellent ergonomics, and are built around displays that avoid showing extraneous information but provide alerts and status reports when the systems sense they are necessary. Finally, you add fly-by-wire control. At that point, after years of work and billions of dollars in development costs, you have arrived in the present time. As intended, the autonomy of pilots has been severely restricted, but the new airplanes deliver smoother, more accurate, and more efficient rides—and safer ones too.

It is natural that some pilots object. This appears to be primarily a cultural and generational matter. In China, for instance, the crews don’t care. In fact, they like their automation and rely on it willingly. By contrast, an Airbus man told me about an encounter between a British pilot and his superior at a Middle Eastern airline, in which the pilot complained that automation had taken the fun out of life, and the superior answered, to paraphrase, “Hey asshole, if you want to have fun, go sail a boat. You fly with automation or find some other job.”

He kept his job. In professional flying, a historic shift has occurred. In the privacy of the cockpit and beyond public view, pilots have been relegated to mundane roles as system managers, expected to monitor the computers and sometimes to enter data via keyboards, but to keep their hands off the controls, and to intervene only in the rare event of a failure. As a result, the routine performance of inadequate pilots has been elevated to that of average pilots, and average pilots don’t count for much. If you are building an airliner and selling it globally, this turns out to be a good thing. Since the 1980s, when the shift began, the safety record has improved fivefold, to the current one fatal accident for every five million departures. No one can rationally advocate a return to the glamour of the past.

Nonetheless there are worries even among the people who invented the future. Boeing’s Delmar Fadden explained, “We say, ‘Well, I’m going to cover the 98 percent of situations I can predict, and the pilots will have to cover the 2 percent I can’t predict.’ This poses a significant problem. I’m going to have them do something only 2 percent of the time. Look at the burden that places on them. First they have to recognize that it’s time to intervene, when 98 percent of the time they’re not intervening. Then they’re expected to handle the 2 percent we couldn’t predict. What’s the data? How are we going to provide the training? How are we going to provide the supplementary information that will help them make the decisions? There is no easy answer. From the design point of view, we really worry about the tasks we ask them to do just occasionally.”

I said, “Like fly the airplane?”

Yes, that too. Once you put pilots on automation, their manual abilities degrade and their flight-path awareness is dulled: flying becomes a monitoring task, an abstraction on a screen, a mind-numbing wait for the next hotel. Nadine Sarter said that the process is known as de-skilling. It is particularly acute among long-haul pilots with high seniority, especially those swapping flying duties in augmented crews. On Air France 447, for instance, Captain Dubois had logged a respectable 346 hours over the previous six months but had made merely 15 takeoffs and 18 landings. Allowing a generous four minutes at the controls for each takeoff and landing, that meant that Dubois was directly manipulating the side-stick for at most only about four hours a year. The numbers for Bonin were close to the same, and for Robert they were smaller. For all three of them, most of their experience had consisted of sitting in a cockpit seat and watching the machine work.

The solution might seem obvious. John Lauber told me that with the advent of C.R.M. and integrated automation, in the 1980s, Earl Wiener went around preaching about “turn-it-off training.” Lauber said, “Every few flights, disconnect all that stuff. Hand-fly it. Fly it like an airplane.”

“What happened to that idea?”

“Everybody said, ‘Yeah. Yeah. We gotta do that.’ And I think for a while maybe they did.”

Sarter, however, is continuing with variations on the theme. She is trying to come up with improved interfaces between pilot and machine. In the meantime, she says, at the very least revert to lower levels of automation (or ignore it) when it surprises you.

In other words, in a crisis, don’t just start reading the automated alerts. The best pilots discard the automation naturally when it becomes unhelpful, and again there appear to be some cultural traits involved. Simulator studies have shown that Irish pilots, for instance, will gleefully throw away their crutches, while Asian pilots will hang on tightly. It’s obvious that the Irish are right, but in the real world Sarter’s advice is hard to sell. The automation is simply too compelling. The operational benefits outweigh the costs. The trend is toward more of it, not less. And after throwing away their crutches, many pilots today would lack the wherewithal to walk.

This is another unintended consequence of designing airplanes that anyone can fly: anyone can take you up on the offer. Beyond the degradation of basic skills of people who may once have been competent pilots, the fourth-generation jets have enabled people who probably never had the skills to begin with and should not have been in the cockpit. As a result, the mental makeup of airline pilots has changed. On this there is nearly universal agreement—at Boeing and Airbus, and among accident investigators, regulators, flight-operations managers, instructors, and academics. A different crowd is flying now, and though excellent pilots still work the job, on average the knowledge base has become very thin.

It seems that we are locked into a spiral in which poor human performance begets automation, which worsens human performance, which begets increasing automation. The pattern is common to our time but is acute in aviation. Air France 447 was a case in point. In the aftermath of the accident, the pitot tubes were replaced on several Airbus models; Air France commissioned an independent safety review that highlighted the arrogance of some of the company’s pilots and suggested reforms; a number of experts called for angle-of-attack indicators in airliners, while others urged a new emphasis on high-altitude-stall training, upset recoveries, unusual attitudes, flying in Alternate Law, and basic aeronautical common sense. All of this was fine, but none of it will make much difference. At a time when accidents are extremely rare, each one becomes a one-off event, unlikely to be repeated in detail. Next time it will be some other airline, some other culture, and some other failure—but it will almost certainly involve automation and will perplex us when it occurs. Over time the automation will expand to handle in-flight failures and emergencies, and as the safety record improves, pilots will gradually be squeezed from the cockpit altogether. The dynamic has become inevitable. There will still be accidents, but at some point we will have only the machines to blame."
Final A330neo analysis; cabin improvements gives the A330neo gains over today’s A330 - Leeham News and Analysis,"Sat, 06 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNC8wOS8wNi9maW5hbC1hMzMwbmVvLWFuYWx5c2lzLWNhYmluLWltcHJvdmVtZW50cy1naXZlcy10aGUtYTMzMG5lby1nYWlucy1vdmVyLXRvZGF5cy1hMzMwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When we did our analysis of the A330neo after the Farnborough launch we limited our checks to trip fuel efficiency as we did not have enough clarity of the cabin improvements that Airbus announced. After a meeting in Toulouse last week with Airbus cabin experts we know have the missing information.

Airbus gives the A330 cabin an interesting update for the A330neo. It comprises A330 ideas (improved crew rests), A350 ideas (improved lighting and IFE) and finally ideas tried out on the A320 (SpaceFlex and SmartLav lavatories). Combined they give the A330neo cabin a better passenger experience and improved utilization of cabin space.

We will now go through these improvements one by one to review the technology behind them and show how they affect the A330neo efficiency. Base for these comparisons are the A330 and A330neo cabin layouts we got from Airbus:

Improved cabin ambiance

Airbus introduces the LED mood lighting from the A350 but does not bring over other things like overhead bins etc. The mood lighting together with improved IFE options will improve passenger experience but it is already available as BFE (Buyer Furnished Equipment) on the A330ceo (e.g. Virgin Atlantic A330ceo’s have similar mood lighting):

Improved crew rest

The A330 cross-section does not have enough crown volume (top of fuselage space) to allow the cockpit and cabin crew rest modules to be placed above the main cabin area like for the A350, Boeing 787 or 777. Therefore Airbus has been confined to use cabin area crew rests or cargo bay modules accessed via staircases from the cabin. Older generation A330-300 have not had a strong requirement for crew rests as their practical endurance has been 8 hours (the limit in most Airworthiness jurisdictions for mandatory rest for crew members). When the A330-200 was introduced in 1998 it complemented the A330 for longer range missions which could span up to 12-13 hours. It thereby inherited the most popular crew rest solutions that were developed for the long-range A340. These consisted of a 2 bed closet for the pilots directly behind the cockpit door, there replacing the standard forward galley and a 3rd door placed staircase to a Lower Deck Movable Crew Rest (LDMCR). This crew rest is housed in an aft cargo hold LD36 container which holds 6 beds for cabin crew.

For the A330neo Airbus will develop an 8 bed lower deck crew rest for both flight and cabin crew, thereby removing the need to take cabin area for crew resting purposes. This frees the area behind the cockpit for galley use which in turn frees up an area equivalent to 4 economy seats in the cabin.

More flexible and narrower lavatories

Airbus has developed the SpaceFlex lavatory/galley concept and the SmartLav lavatory for the A320. These are now added to the A330neo cabin options to enable increased cabin efficiency also for long-haul. The SpaceFlex lavatory allows the combination of two normal lavatories to be combined into one PRM lavatory (PRM=Persons with Reduced Mobility). The PRM lavatory allows a wheelchair bound person to use the lav after cabin crew have folded away the separation wall to create one big lavatory.

The person then use the one lav as the parking area for the wheelchair while sliding over to use the other lavatory. This dual lavatory module is more efficient then the PRM and normal lavatory it replaces, freeing up space equivalent to a little more than 2 seats.

Further space is found by introducing the narrower type lavatory which Boeing is introducing on the new Delta 737-900, there called “Modular lavatory”. Airbus variant is called SmartLav and is in development for the A320. They both redistribute space for plumbing/pumps from the lav’s sink side to a “dog-house” bulge in the non-occupied feet area of the last seat-row before the lav. They thereby can narrow down the system area on the sink side of the lavatory, this is combined with a narrow sink which is pushed further into the lavatories gangway.

The overall effect is a lav that occupies 15% less cabin length compared to today’s standard of 36 inch/0.92m. This gains the cabin 1/3 of a seat per lavatory so several lavatories have to be combined to gain a seat, but in the cabin of today every inch counts.

Does these gains exist in practice?

The Airbus cabin drawings are done so that gains realized by the changes could be combined to a total of 10 seats in the case of the A330-900 vs A330-300 and 6 seats for the A330-800 vs. A330-200. Would one also see these gains in an operator designed cabin? The gains from the changed crew rests are real, they free the space equivalent to 4 economy seats. The SpaceFlex lavatory is a nice solution to the problem of providing a PRM capable lavatory in the cabin, the effect is a gain of slightly more than 2 seats. Thereby Airbus has gained the 6 seat they need for their claimed increase of per seat fuel efficiency of A330-900 vs. A330-300 of 2%.

Airbus has also said that the total potential for a A330-900 would be an increase to 10 seat if SmartLav technology is added to the mix. This is more questionable as each SmartLav only gains 1/3 of a seat. In the example Airbus uses 4 SmarLavs (the rearmost lav is shorter and therefore stays the normal width) for a total gain of 1 and 1/3 seat. Together with the space left over from the SpaceFlex one might see a total of 2 further seats, should narrower lavs be acceptable for a long haul aircraft. We think it might be for the economy class but not for the 2nd and 3rd lavatory for the business class as in the Airbus example. The gains would then reduce to around 1 seat in addition to the 6 we gained before.

Conclusion

The 2% gain in per seat efficiency for the A330neo is plausible as this is gained before the question of narrower lavs comes into play. It will be up to each operator to decide if they want to introduce the SmartLav into long-haul, we doubt it will be allowed into the premium areas of the cabin. One could thereby say that Airbus claims for the A330neo would be substantiated, given that the 12% trip gain is correct. Our analysis with our proprietary model shows that the gains are plausible but only under the conditions given at launch, Airbus slides state “Datum is a A330-300 235t MTOW with Trent 772B engines Vs,” i.e. the variant flying today. The gain over the A330 242t ceo variant due in 2015 thereby stays at around 10% trip and 12% per seat on the given 4000nm mission.

Airbus still provide cabins for comparisons with a fixed business class of 36 seats both for the 250 seat and 300 seat segments, this makes their results non-comparable between the models. How this all stack up with more realistic average mission lengths, fully normalized cabins and how the final A330neo compares to Boeing’s 787 we will describe in our updated A330neo report, we now have all the details for this update.

Royal Thai Police takes delivery of new Airbus AS365 N3+ helicopter - Homeland Security Technology,"Wed, 24 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ob21lbGFuZHNlY3VyaXR5LXRlY2hub2xvZ3kuY29tL25ld3MvbmV3c3JveWFsLXRoYWktcG9saWNlLXRha2VzLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LW9mLW5ldy1haXJidXMtYXMzNjUtbjMtaGVsaWNvcHRlci00Mzg1NDczL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters has delivered the first of two search and rescue configured AS365 N3+ helicopters to the Thai Police aviation division, the Royal Thai Police (RTP).

Delivered as part of an order placed between 2012 and 2013, the new helicopter is equipped with electrical hoist, rappelling installation, cargo sling and search lights.

An RTP spokesperson said: ""This new acquisition is part of RTP’s modernisation programme to reinforce our capability to protect and serve the people.

""This helicopter will be particularly useful in rescue activities as well as in supporting our traditional police missions such as border protection, anti-smuggling and anti-terrorism.""

Capable of being operated in hot climates and high altitudes, the AS365 N3+’s size and manoeuvrability are said to enable police forces to manoeuvre in the most curbed areas.



The helicopter’s 4-axis autopilot feature is expected to ease troop workload and assist in simplifying the most demanding operations including search and rescue missions.

Airbus Helicopters Southeast Asia managing director Derek Sharples said: ""Besides benefiting from Airbus Helicopters’ Bangkok-based support centre, RTP will also receive high quality training in nearby Singapore where the AS365 N3+ full-flight simulator is located.""

The RTP has been operating a fleet of Airbus Helicopters’ Dauphin family comprising five EC155s since 2009 as Royal transport aircraft.

The second aircraft under the order is expected to be delivered in mid-2015.

Airbus Joins Aerion's SST Project - AVweb,"Tue, 23 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF2d2ViLmNvbS9yZWNlbnQtdXBkYXRlcy9idXNpbmVzcy1taWxpdGFyeS9haXJidXMtam9pbnMtYWVyaW9ucy1zc3QtcHJvamVjdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has agreed to collaborate on technology development with Aerion Corporation, the Reno, Nevada, company that has been working over the last decade to develop a supersonic business jet. “To further their mutual objectives, both companies will exchange knowledge and capabilities in design, manufacturing and certification,” Aerion announced on Monday. Airbus will provide technical and certification support, including the assignment of senior engineering staff to the Aerion program. “This is a major step forward for Aerion,” said chairman Robert Bass. “It puts us solidly on track toward our objective of certifying the world’s first supersonic business jet in 2021. Needless to say, we are thrilled with the resources Airbus Group will bring to the program.”

Under the current timeline, Aerion is targeting first flight of the AS2 supersonic jet in the 2019 timeframe. “This agreement accomplishes two major objectives,” said Aerion CEO Doug Nichols. “It provides validation from the industry leader in aerospace innovation, and it decisively kicks the program into high gear.” Initial collaboration activities have commenced between engineering teams from Aerion and Airbus Defence and Space, which is Airbus Group’s principal liaison organization for AS2 development. The AS2 would carry 8 to 12 passengers at speeds up to Mach 1.6, with a range of about 5,000 nm. It comes with a price tag of about $100 million; the company says it has letters of intent for 50 aircraft.AVweb’s editorial director Paul Bertorelli recently took a look at the Aerion program; click here for his video update and here for his analysis."
A350 certified; we provide a comprehensive program review - Leeham News and Analysis,"Tue, 30 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNC8wOS8zMC9hMzUwLWNlcnRpZmllZC13ZS1wcm92aWRlLWEtY29tcHJlaGVuc2l2ZS1wcm9ncmFtLXJldmlldy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus’ most recent all-new aircraft, the A350 has achieved civil airline airworthiness certification from EASA today September 30, FAA certification will follow. It marks an end to an eight year program to develop an all-new airliner in the 250-350 passenger segment. It also creates a point where a review of this last (for quite a while) big aircraft program is called for.

Below we go through all the aspects of the A350, not only program and technical aspects but also organizational, economical and market communication aspects. In all those dimensions it was the big step forward.

The first incarnation of the A350 was conceived as a response to Boeings 787 during summer 2004, initially as a revamped A330 (very much like today’s A330neo) and then finally as a re-winged, re-engined A350, very similar in its changes to today’s 777X.

When the program started in its final iteration at the Farnborough Air Show in 2006, 53% of the airframe and wings were composites. The concept had been stretched from an eight abreast design to nine abreast, then called A350 XWB for extra wide body. Final industrial launch was 1 December 2006.

A350 XWB design

The XWB variant did away with the A330 fuselage cross section and introduced a carbon fiber re-enforced plastic (CFRP) fuselage which now had a 0,35m or 14 inches wider cabin to enable nine abreast seating with 18 inch seats. Much has been made about the A350 fuselage now being made of large panels, which has four longitudinal joins for the panels to form a barrel section. The competing Boeing 787 was made with shorter barrels which were only joined circumferentially. This is probably the difference between the design that has the least operational and technical influence between the aircraft. They are both CFRP based fuselages which enable higher cabin pressure and humidity for passenger comfort and reduced maintenance requirements as CFRP is virtually fatigue and corrosion immune.

The A350 and the 787 share many design solutions, such as CFRP based structure, wing design with high lift arrangement (cooperating spoilers and flaps for simple and effective high lift trailing edge, adaptive wing for optimal cruise lift versus drag ratio and load alleviation) and way of attaching the main landing gear by means of a Y spar arrangement on the inner trailing edge (the so-called Yehudi). They also have similar avionics concepts, based on networks of computing nodes connected with an adapted Ethernet network (AFDX).

The biggest difference between the A350 and the 787 is the way they deliverer power to the aircraft’s different systems. Boeing decided 2003 that it was time to go for an all electrical power conversion chain from the engine source to the power consuming system whereas Airbus decided to stay with a conventional system (inherited from the A380) which split the power delivery between an electrical conversion chain and a pneumatic one. While Airbus could migrate a modern classical system and its vendors to the requirements of the A350, Boeing had to start from scratch, architecting numerous firsts in the process such as water-cooled conversion electronics in an extra equipment bay behind the main landing gear bay. New designs from scratch means new challenges and Boeing had its share of operational problems with the more electrical systems architecture (conversion panel short-circuits, battery problems….). The all electrical architecture also means higher requirements on auxiliary power, the high electrical requirements of the 787 have made more than one airport power aggregate look bleak.

In contrast, the A350 system side has been smooth sailing with a high system maturity evident in the unusually trouble-free flight test period. This should also give initial airliner service an easier start. Once through the initial problems the more efficient power conversion of an electrical system should gain the 787 a slight efficiency advantage on the system side. In retrospect Boeing probably ask itself if it was worth all the hard lessons.

The A350 continues the Airbus tradition of a Fly-By-Wire aircraft with a family look-and-use cockpit (including side-stick), enabling an aircraft characteristics and cockpit commonality which has reduced aircrew cross-certification requirements since the A320. The Fly-By-Wire system is now in its fourth major revision with the signaling to the rudders going full digital; its maturity and adaptability has been obvious. We met with some of the A350 test pilots at Farnborough and they all said the A350 was very similar to an A330 to fly and the flight testing of the base characteristics of the aircraft had been virtually trouble-free.

System and Flight testing

Airbus has had the advantage to work with mature system concepts and their retained suppliers from previous programs. While all components have been brought up to date there has been no major architectural change in critical systems like flight control, power distribution, hydraulics, air conditioning etc. This has laid the foundation for a system and flight test that could focus on system maturity at EIS instead of getting the systems to work correctly. The final flight testing had been preceded by an extensive system test of individual components up to complete system rigs. But even before A350 hardware was available the correct functioning and interaction of all the myriad of system had been tested with digital models simulating the interaction of all critical systems.

As a consequence of all these preparations flight testing has been unusually trouble-free. The flight test team recognized they got an unusually mature aircraft when preparing for the 14 June 2013 first flight. This impression has since not changed. The aircraft has gone through flight testing without any major findings, allowing Airbus to stick to the 3Q2014 certification schedule set after previous development delays.

Program management

Airbus had major deficiencies in the program management of its previous program, the A380. The company was still suffering from having been a consortium of independent national companies, each convinced that they knew best how to design and produce their part, to the extent that they even reserved the right to have their own tools (the famous Catia version 4 to version 5 incompatibility between the German and the French parts being only the tip of the iceberg). Lessons learned from the A380 (and from observing the tortured development of the Boeing 787) were applied to the A350 program, not in the least in the company structure and program management. The company was galvanized into one by several restructuring programs (Power8, Future EADS) and program management was reinforced.

The A350 program manager, Didier Evrard, reported to the COO, Fabrice Brégier, and when Brégier was elected CEO, Evrard moved up as well in the corporate structure. Evrard thereby had the position to escalate any resource conflict or hold-up in the company. Further lessons learned were drawn from the troubled A380 program. All parts of the company were forced to work on the same toolset (the main being the product lifecycle management system, Windchill, and the 3D design tool, CATIA). Strict rules were introduced where every engineer and partner (in total 5,000 people including 60 partners) had to manifest every change of a design in the gigantic Windchill database. Catia was then used to visualize in 3D any changes in the design of the aircraft in real time. This visual mode, which is constantly updated to stay current, is called DMU (Digital Mock Up). The realtime DMU meant there was only one copy of the virtual A350 and one could rely on all the data in the database being current. This was a big change from the A380 where multiple copies of the aircraft were being worked on in the different countries and no-one knew which model was up to date and if so in what part of the model.

Another area which was given much attention was program management rules. In earlier projects, should, for instance, a part of the flap system not be finished for a critical design review, one could still let the wing pass the review and let the failing part catch up on a side-track to the main design. This rule, to keep the time plan and fix later, lead to the traveled work on the A380 and 787. It meant that work was being done by persons other than those who should normally handle the matter, requiring re-learning for these persons once the traveled work package was closed. It created inefficiencies and that knowledge was built up in the wrong hands. When finally the part was to be installed, one often had to disassemble the aircraft first as the part was now out of sequence. Further, the original tasks that should have been performed on the parts removed now had to wait until things are reassembled. Finally the knowledge had to be transferred to those in the production chain who should normally handle the task. Airbus changes this to the principle of “Stop and Fix” for the A350. It is better to take a delay immediately than later. This ensured that whatever problem caused the part to not meet the deadline the fix was worked on by the relevant persons or groups. It also builds the pre-production competence in the right places. This principle was also extended to production. Airbus was extremely cautious in the ramp of the test aircraft and later the first production aircraft, with the benefit of not having (too many) parts out of sequence.

The principle of “stop and fix” could be seen in work in the early parts of the program. The new composite construction caused some new problems to solve. CFRP parts don’t conduct electricity so an extra layer of metal mesh had to be introduced to serve as a lightning conduction part and as an electrical return path. The design of this rather complex “electrical structural network” took longer than planned. Another aspect of CFRP is that it is very strong in the fiber’s long axis but not in the traverse axis. Consequently a lot of work and testing had to be done on the so called “damage tolerance” of the aircraft’s skins. The strength of CFRP allows these skins to be very thin in places but the normal bumping into the aircraft by ground vehicles, docking for catering or cargo loading, could cause non-visible damage to the layered matrix. Hence the CFRP material thickness had to be increased beyond what was required from a structural point, as this adds weight the investigations into just how much were important and these took longer then planned.

The effects can be seen in the schedule graph which is a cut from Airbus presentations in early 2010 and late 2011. By 2010 these delays had eaten up all margins and the subsequent discovery of other issues lead to the rescheduling of the whole program, first to mid 2014 delivery, then finally to “second half of 2014”.

These are just examples of the myriad of causes that forced Airbus to delay the program first by a year and then finally by 18 months. The effect of this principle was the there were delays in the initial and mid-part of the program. Once the necessary maturity had been reached for the different parts and systems, the time-plan stabilized and the test period was one of the smoothest ever. There has been no further delay since summer 2013.

Program communication

The A350 program has also broken new ground in how communication has been handled. Initially the communication tone was “we will not be delayed like the 787” i.e. a self-assured style like its competitor, with exact milestones that would not be touched. When it was seen that delays were inevitable, the communication tone changed and became more understated and cautious. Milestones were always given as “second half of 2013” rather than exact and it was always stressed that the program was very challenging.

Nowhere was the communication more elegantly handled then around the considerable weight creep the program experienced. All-in–all, the Operating Empty Weight increase from launch to EIS was in the region of 6%-7% compared with 12% for the weight-troubled 787-8. Boeing subsequently got that down to 9%. Where the outcry re the 787 weight creep was massive, it was virtually non-existent for the A350. Airbus waited with all hints of major weight changes until flight testing had shown exactly where they were, then the range was quietly cut with 350 nautical miles despite a change to a lighter two class interior of 315 seats (instead of the original 314 seat 3-class interior) and the addition of a maximum MTOW variant that raised MTOW from 268t to 275t. The few that noticed the range changes were told that if was indeed no specification change, the cabin had changed and so did the range. These changes represent more than an hour’s worth of fuel but few seems to have noticed (other than Leeham News, which reported it at the time). There has been no media attention on this blip. (The customers have, of course, known all the time; the only one who has been vocal about it is Emirates Airlines, which canceled their order for this reason among others).

This media strategy has rendered Airbus a lot of good will, to the degree that when slip up occur it does not have much news value.

Entry into service and production ramp

The challenge now for Airbus is the first customer’s experience of the aircraft’s reliability and how Airbus can manage the ramp up of production. Perhaps unfortunately for Airbus, the first operator will be Qatar Airways, whose CEO, the mercurial Akbar Al-Baker, isn’t the least bit shy about criticizing any of the OEMs on real and perceived shortcomings, often doing so publicly.

To ensure a high degree of visibility on the operationional maturity problems that can occur, the Airbus flight test operation worked as Airline number 1, i.e. all operational routines, etc. has been carried out as if the flight test was an airline operating the five test aircrafts. This has made it possible for Airbus to identify any problem areas that might not come up in traditional flight testing where aircrafts are fixed for glitches directly by the development organization.

We have carefully monitored the production during recent years. The flight test aircraft had slips in their entry into service of typically 1-2 months over of what was originally presented. For the customer deliveries we see the chance of two aircraft delivered to Qatar this year and for a further six Qatar deliveries first Quarter 2015. This is enabled by the FAL start curve we see below presented by Airbus at the innovation days in June, the rate, presently at two starts per month, goes to three starts per month end of this year and these aircraft will be delivered end Q2 2015.

Production time is around 8.5 calendar months for the first aircraft, then gradually reducing to seven months for deliveries in Q1 2015 and six months by next summer. Airbus has made several expansions in the production facilities in Toulouse and right now we see no reason that they should not deliver to their latest communicated plan.

A350-800 and -1000

The A350 is the latest in a range of clean sheet designs by the large OEMs (A380, 787, A350). Its fortunes will decide Airbus’ market share in the profitable large twin widebody segment. The smallest variant was officially canceled last week by CEO Brégier, its place being taken by the A330neo. This leaves the A350 production system free to focus on the above 300 seat segment where we are now waiting for its larger variant, the -1000. Programmed for mid-2017 EIS, its fortunes will be decided by how Airbus can control the weight increase versus the A350-900, right now by 10-13 tonnes. Its position was comfortable when the competition was the heavy and under-winged Boeing 777-300ER. This has all changed since Dubai Airshow last year where Boeing launched its answer to the A350-1000, the 777-8X and -9X. The -9X is especially troublesome for Airbus as it flies more passengers further at about the same seat cost as the A350-1000. For an airline that does not need the capacity, the A350-1000 is a safer choice with considerably lower trip costs. Should the airline need more capacity, the A350-1000 is pressed. We expect an answer from Airbus in the 400 seat segment in the coming years.

Summary

The A350 had a troubled birth, an initial development that generated delays and then a final two years where everything has gone to plan. The initial development tactic of accepting delays to build maturity in the design has paid off. The next phase of the A350 program will be no less interesting then the first, to follow the induction into service; it has potential to set new benchmarks for modern clean-sheet designs.

Aerion and Airbus Defence and Space professionals will work together at Aerion’s new and larger engineering offices in Reno, Nevada.

“This is a major step forward for Aerion,” said the company’s chairman and principal investor, Robert M. Bass. “It puts us solidly on track toward our objective of certifying the world’s first supersonic business jet in 2021. Needless to say, we are thrilled with the resources Airbus Group will bring to the program.”

Over the longer term, Aerion will provide proprietary technology and assistance to Airbus Group in its high-performance aircraft technology development. These technologies include Aerion’s extensive research, its proprietary design tools and patented aero

dynamic designs.

“Aerion’s pioneering work has broad applications for both performance and efficiency. We are looking forward to a fruitful cooperation,” said Jean Botti, Airbus Group chief technical officer.

The joint effort provides expanded engineering capabilities to Aerion as it enters a design phase in which propulsion systems, structures, avionics and equipment are specified and sourced. Under the current timeline, Aerion is targeting first flight of the AS2 in

the 2019 timeframe.

“This agreement accomplishes two major objectives,” according to Aerion CEO Doug Nichols. “It provides validation from the industry leader in aerospace innovation, and it decisively kicks the program into high gear. Each company will benefit. Aerion moves quickly toward building a supersonic jet, and Airbus Group gains exclusive access to more than a decade of successful research and proprietary high-performance aircraft technology.”

Initial collaboration activities have commenced between engineering teams from Aerion and Airbus Defence and Space, which is Airbus Group’s principal liaison organization for AS2 development."
Next-generation Airbus A350 plane gets EU green light - Yahoo Singapore News,"Tue, 30 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHA6Ly9zZy5uZXdzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXh0LWdlbmVyYXRpb24tYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtcGxhbmUtZ2V0cy1ldS1ncmVlbi0xMTQxNTcyNTQuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"EU authorities gave the green light Tuesday for Airbus's new long-haul A350 plane to enter service, opening the way for delivery of the next-generation aircraft to first client Qatar Airways. Designed to help the European manufacturer catch up with its American rival Boeing in the market for long-haul, fuel-efficient planes, the A350-900 makes extensive use of light composite materials which reduce fuel consumption and costs. ""Airbus demonstrated that the aircraft complies with the regulatory safety and environment requirements defined by EASA (the European Aviation Safety Agency) for the European Union,"" the EU aviation watchdog said in a statement. Airbus has positioned its A350 between the Boeing's popular 777 and its 787 Dreamliner, hoping to eat away at both planes' markets. ""Every new type of aircraft needs to obtain a ... certificate before it can be delivered to an airline,"" EASA said in its statement. ""This EASA certificate guarantees that the A350-900 is set for delivery from a safety and environment point of view."" The plane can carry 315 passengers over a distance of 14.500 kilometres (9,000 miles), and to date, 750 A350 aircraft have been ordered by 39 customers worldwide. In August, Airbus had announced that the plane had completed its ""route proving"", a round-the-world in 20 days trip aimed at testing the aircraft's readiness for airline operations, during which it flew 180 hours and stopped off in 14 airports."

Named the Covert Aeronautical Cocktail Shaker, it comes with an Art-Deco airplane shape that made us think of the famous Airbus Beluga, considered one of the world’s strangest-looking airplanes.

The Airbus A300-600ST has recently celebrated 20 years of existence, but this article is not about that. However, the moment we’ve stumbled upon this cocktail shaker we instantly thought about the whale-like shaped famous airplane. Beluga is a version of the standard A300-600 wide-body airliner modified to carry aircraft parts and oversized cargo. At first, it was named Super Transporter.Now, back to our little party toy. According to the source , it’s shape is supposed to recall the covert cocktail shakers developed during prohibition, an Art-Deco airplane shaker that serves up chilled drinks. The fuselage-shaped shaker rests horizontally on the winged stand with two propellers, evoking an executive’s desk ornament. It removes from the stand, while its rounded lid opens for adding enough ice, vermouth, gin and olive juice for three mean martinis.The three aeronautical stabilizers act as sturdy feet for keeping the shaker upright on a bar and the plated nickel exterior can be hand washed and buffed to maintain its sheen. That being said, for 100 bucks you’ll have the shaker that could make the difference.So, are you ready to party on the weekend?"

Airbus, the world’s leading commercial aircraft manufacturer, has recently made a patent application for a virtual reality isolation helmet that might change the way we think of flying.

With similar looks to what we’re used to seeing in Sci-Fi movies, the helmet would allow the users to fully immerse themselves in in-flight entertainment as it cancels out all other peripheral noise. Created by French designer Bernard Guering, the device includes a carrier and a helmet for at least partially housing the head of the passenger.According to the patent application , the helmet is attached to the carrier and is movably mounted in relation to the it. Its most important feature is the capacity of the device to completely isolate the passenger from any exterior disturbance and create a sort of virtual reality. Its creators have designed it with several options, as the isolation can be a sound, visual and/or olfactory, total or partial for any of these aspects.Each in-flight headset would come with a built-in video screen, glasses for better viewing and earphones designed to be used while watching films, listening to music or playing video games.Will it become reality? It’s hard to say. “It is just a patent. In order to satisfy the needs of our airline customers and their passengers, our industry looks into the future a year and a hundred years ahead,” Airbus Communications Manager Mary Anne Greczyn told Yahoo. It turns out the company files thousands of patents for almost anything the design team create, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they all make it to production."

The overhead stowage area offers 10 per cent more space than the existing bins. In addition, the bins take advantage of the A320’s cross-section fuselage to increase overall capacity for luggage by 60 per cent.

Aesthetically, the pivoting overhead lockers embody the same modern curved appearance that has influenced Airbus’ most recent designs – such as the cabin of the upcoming A350 XWB airliner.

The new cabin feature will be available starting from Q1 of 2016, with Delta Air Lines slated to be the first to receive the updated design. The American carrier has 45 A321s currently on order.

According to Airbus, the upgrade is also available for retrofit, meaning that carriers with older models of the A320 will be able to have those aircraft modified with the new feature.

World's Largest Passenger Plane Lands at DFW - NBC DFW,"Thu, 25 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2Rmdy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9kZnctcmVhZHktZm9yLXdvcmxkcy1sYXJnZXN0LXBhc3Nlbmdlci1wbGFuZS8xMTM0MjMv0gFcaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjZGZ3LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2Rmdy1yZWFkeS1mb3Itd29ybGRzLWxhcmdlc3QtcGFzc2VuZ2VyLXBsYW5lLzExMzQyMy8_YW1wPTE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The largest passenger jet in the world, the Airbus A380, landed Monday at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, completing the longest currently flown nonstop route in the world.

The 8,600-mile flight was the first of what will be six weekly, nonstop flights on Australia's Qantas Airways between Sydney's Kingsford Smith International Airport and DFW. The flights will depart and arrive every day but Tuesday and are expected to take just under 15 hours to DFW and 15 hours and 30 minutes to Australia.

""It's very appropriate that the longest flight in commercial aviation, Sydney to Dallas-Fort Worth, now has the largest airplane flying it,"" said Sean Donohue, the CEO of DFW International Airport.

In honor of the inaugural flight, the airline added a bit of flair to their kangaroo livery — including a cowboy hat and bandanna.

Additionally, travelers were offered the option of a Texas-inspired menu including barbecue sliders, Dr Pepper, rib-eye steaks and chipotle pork tacos.

After crossing the Pacific Ocean and Mexico, Qantas Flight 7 lumbered along on final approach before touching down about 25 minutes early Monday afternoon. After which, the travelers were greeted with a celebratory water cannon salute before coming to a stop at a specially-modified gate at Terminal D.

Actor John Travolta, who serves as the airline's ambassador, helped welcome the first flight to DFW.

""That was the happiest group of passengers and crew I have ever seen get off a 15-hour flight,"" said Travolta.

The Qantas A380 seats 484 passengers, including 14 First Class Suites, 64 Business Class seats, 35 Premium Economy seats and 371 Economy Class seats with room for four crew rest areas.

Qantas A380 Lands at DFW Airport

On Wednesday, Emirates Airlines joins Qantas as the second airline flying the superjumbo passenger jet into DFW; Emirates flights will be direct to and from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

DFW Airport has been preparing for its newest arrival for years. A decade ago, Terminal D was designed with the European-built A380 in mind.

“It always was the dream for this particular terminal to have A380 service,” said Perfecto Solis, vice president for airport development and engineering.

Consider the stats for the double-decker behemoth:

500+ passengers

261 foot wingspan

79 feet tall

The plane is so large that workers at DFW painted its outline on the tarmac to see exactly how much space it would need. They also used 3-D computer models to see how the A380 would fit in at DFW.

Starting next week, the Airbus A380 – the largest passenger jet in the world – will begin scheduled service at DFW. Australia’s Qantas will fly the A380 between DFW and Sydney.

Despite years of advance planning, DFW still had to make $4.5 million in tweaks to accommodate the A380. Taxiways have been widened, and hundreds of seats have been added inside the terminal for waiting passengers.

But the most visible changes are at the gate. The A380 will occupy two gates at once — D15 and D16. Passengers will use three jet bridges, one of which rises more than 30 feet off the ground to reach the plane's upper deck.

With the arrival of the A380, DFW joins the ranks of cities like London and New York, where the A380 is a regular sight.

“I think it speaks directly to the fact that the international community sees DFW as an international powerhouse,” said Solis.

Airline officials say the new addition will have a $200 million economic impact on North Texas.

""This is a huge boost of confidence for Dallas-Fort Worth Airport and the community,"" said Qantas Senior Executive Vice President Vanessa Hudson.

Etihad Airways ready to roll out luxury Airbus A380 - The National,"Tue, 23 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5hdGlvbmFsbmV3cy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvZXRpaGFkLWFpcndheXMtcmVhZHktdG8tcm9sbC1vdXQtbHV4dXJ5LWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLTEuMjM3MzU30gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Etihad Airways has an opportunity to outshine its rivals by offering another level of luxury when it begins operating the world’s largest passenger aircraft – the Airbus A380 – later this year, aviation analysts said.

Etihad will roll out its first two-deck superjumbo aircraft Thursday and deploy it on its three-times-a-day flight to London and its Sydney route. The Abu Dhabi carrier will also revamp the upper deck of the Airbus jet as it seeks to raise the stakes of luxury travel with a flying hotel suite on the plane.

“Many people have already found Etihad to have a superior premium product than Emirates,” said Will Horton, a senior analyst at the Sydney-based Capa Centre for Aviation. “Etihad may not have Emirates’ A380 bar, but people like Etihad offering lie-flat, direct-aisle-access business class seats across its long-haul fleet. Emirates and Qatar don’t have that.”

Qatar Airways, which received its first A380 last week, had failed to impress or fallen behind on the interior spec, according to analysts. But this can also be attributed to the airline's rather ""practical"" strategy.

The Qatar Airways chief executive, Akbar Al Baker, had said that his A380 was not coming with butlers and other goodies. The airline is now keen to optimise revenue.

It will start flying its A380 next month from its Doha base to London Heathrow. The carrier has ordered 10 A380s and has options for three more.

“Differentiation in strategies is clearly paramount in succeeding with the Middle East big three at each others’ doorsteps,” said Daniel Tsang, the founder and chief analyst at the Hong Kong-based aviation consultancy Aspire Aviation.

“Etihad is adopting an equity-alliance and luxury approach. Emirates is offering the most comprehensive network connecting virtually every port on Earth, and Qatar is seeking to deepen its ties with IAG’s British Airways unit on a possible joint venture between Doha and London Heathrow.”

Emirates, the world's biggest operator of the super-jumbo plane, already flies 50 of the aircraft and awaits 90 more in its book order.

“It was the Emirates A380 that became the symbol of the region’s airlines,” said Addison Schonland, a founder and partner of US-based AirInsight.

“The colours on the tail of an Emirates A380 have probably been the single greatest item to ‘show the flag’ worldwide,” he added.

As for routes, Emirates has spoken of an operating cost advantage for the A380. It can provide more seats at peak times, which a higher frequency could not necessarily do, according Mr Horton.

Another advantage for the double-deck plane is its larger capacity. It provides more seats in cases where a country’s bilateral aviation agreement does not allow higher frequencies.

“Many airlines continue to look at the A380 with some fear – it’s big and expensive,” said Mr Schonland. “Yet we see Emirates has successfully deployed it all over – on routes nobody would have thought of, like Manchester.”

Mr Schonland added that Emirates tends to build traffic on routes. The airline will switch from the smaller Airbus A330 to the Boeing 777, then switch again to the A380, which makes competitors “dread the arrival of Emirates” on a route, he said.

As for space, airlines that operate the A380 have tremendous flexibility with the seating. They can redesign the seating to optimise economics on routes. “The A380 to India is quite different than the A380 to New York in Emirates’ fleet,” said Mr Schonland.

Richard Aboulafia, the vice president for analysis at Teal Group Corporation, said that the A380 works only if an airline is growing. If the business is flat or declining, “it’s a disaster”. For the A380, an airline needs to focus on premium traffic, not economy; otherwise, buying a bigger plane just means more “low-margin backpackers”.

“The A380 works for the Arabian Gulf carriers, and pretty much nobody else,” said Mr Aboulafia.

“This is largely because of geography. What kills the A380 for the legacy carriers in Europe and Asia and the US is that you’d bring people into hubs, and then you’d need to send a large proportion of these passengers out again on smaller flights that are less efficient.

“However, for Gulf carriers everyone coming in arrives in long-haul twin jets, and they leave on long-haul twin jets. There are very few short-range smaller connecting flights,” he added.

Discussing the airline's much anticipated upcoming IPO, Pham said the widebodies would be replaced by ten A350-900s and eight B787-9s the first models of which are expected to begin arriving next year.

The new aircraft, Pham said, would allow the airline to begin services to the United States though their launch would depend on weighing the risks up given that flights to North America, while longer than European flights, are only slightly more profitable.

""Therefore, after equitization, investors may want to give priority to flights to Europe than to open a route to the United States,"" he said.

The signing of a Bilateral Air Services Agreement between Vietnam and the US in 2003 allows US airlines to serve Hanoi Noi Bai International, Ho Chi Minh City, and Da Nang while Vietnamese carriers are allowed to serve five destinations in the US.

In 2005, Vietnam Airlines announced plans to commence services to San Francisco though these never materialized.

Currently, there are no scheduled carriers connecting the US directly with Vietnam."
"Patching up aircraft, the composites way (Part 2) - Reinforced Plastics","Tue, 30 Sep 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlaW5mb3JjZWRwbGFzdGljcy5jb20vY29udGVudC9mZWF0dXJlcy9wYXRjaGluZy11cC1haXJjcmFmdC10aGUtY29tcG9zaXRlcy13YXktcGFydC0yL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Composite patches are becoming an increasingly attractive option to repair aircraft structures, but the process needs to be speeded up. George Marsh reports on the various techniques being investigated.

As composites become more widely employed in commercial aircraft fast techniques to repair these materials are becoming more important. (Picture courtesy of Christian Lagerek/Shutterstock.com.)

Part 1 of this article introduced the concept of composite patch repair and discussed techniques studied under the European AeroPlan programme. Part 2 outlines composite repair techniques being used by Boeing and Airbus.

Boeing and Airbus solutions

Composite patches are increasingly preferred because they can be bonded rather than bolted, forming a superior repair.

While taking into account the R&D programmes brought together in AeroPlan, the leading airframers have, unsurprisingly, been developing their own patch repair solutions. Both Boeing Commercial Airplanes and Airbus have sought to address the issue of ‘ramp rash’ – the sort of generally modest damage caused when service vehicles and equipment bump into aircraft, particularly their fuselages. Traditionally, these ‘dings’ have been fixed with bolted metal patches that are familiar on aluminium aircraft. These have been of aluminium or titanium, although today composite patches are increasingly preferred because they can be bonded rather than bolted, forming a superior repair.

For the new breed of passenger jets having composite fuselages, composite patches are recommended due to the more effective bonds that can be formed between the similar materials. Boeing has developed for its B787 Dreamliner, the first composite-fuselaged passenger jet to enter service, a quick-cure repair patch. This patented system comprises a pre-cured carbon fibre/epoxy patch which, when heated with a chemical heat pack, enables a typical repair to be carried out ‘in an hour,’ according to the company. Because it utilises an adhesive that cures at relatively low temperature, the repair is intended as temporary and sufficient to restore enough strength to permit continued service until a full restorative repair can be undertaken. A number of quick-cure repairs have already been made to in-service aircraft.

Airbus has sought to make patch repairing a more automated procedure, having developed a small mobile system able to tailor pre-cured composite patches for specific repair sites. Its automated system first gathers 3D surface data of the damaged area using a stereoscopic camera, then ultrasonically tests the area to determine the damage extent. Next, it applies robotic milling to remove damaged material. The repair patch is produced using a 3D scan of the milled repair area, and then applied to the fuselage with a film adhesive. After being vacuum bagged, the repair is cured under heat and pressure. Infusion option

German aerospace research organisation DLR reminds us that a pre-impregnated, pre-cured (hard) patch is not the only patch option and champions a solution based on infusing a dry preform in situ. DLR says this method produces results as good as those achievable with hard patches. It is said to suit curved surfaces better, avoiding the need to produce a tool in which to mould a hard patch, with the associated time and expense.

This infusion method is part of an automated system DLR has developed that can make repairs which are flush to the repaired surface rather than formed over the top. It would therefore suit more permanent repairs made at times when base maintenance is scheduled. The automated cell uses NDE tools to survey the damage and produce 3D digitised imagery, then cuts out damaged material under computer control to precise dimensions derived from the survey. It then manufactures a preform to match those dimensions, inserts this into the excised space, infuses resin into the preform and applies heat and pressure to effect a cure.

Automated repair technology 'virtually essential' to the profitable operation of composite aircraft.

In repairs that extend the full depth of the laminate, the infused preform is more a plug than a patch. Either way, the patch/plug has chamfered edges that sit precisely on a matching edge profile lasered into the repair site. This ensures a flush finish that renders the final scarfed repair virtually invisible. It is more integral and should be inherently stronger than an overlain patch as well as aesthetically superior.

Other automated repair cells are being developed outside Europe, including one in the USA under development by a consortium led by American GFM, a branch of Austrian machine tool maker GFM. Proponents of this and other systems see automated repair technology as being virtually essential to the profitable operation of composite aircraft, particularly as these begin to populate the skies in significant numbers. Automated cells should reduce labour costs and the chances of human error as well as that crucial MRO metric, time to repair.

Largest patch

Demonstrably the largest composite patch so far implemented for repairing primary aerostructure is that produced by Boeing for the Ethiopean Airlines B787 that suffered a fire while parked, empty, at London’s Heathrow Airport in July 2013. The fire, caused by a faulty emergency locator beacon, burned out a sizeable section of the crown of the monolithic carbon/epoxy fuselage laminate.

Reports describe how, to make the repair, Boeing accessed an entire rear fuselage barrel in the factory and cut out a ~25 ft long area of its crown corresponding with the damaged area on the Ethiopean jet. This became the repair patch. This large patch, complete with sections of the attached frames and co-moulded stringers, was then flown to Heathrow where it was lowered into the same-sized aperture left by the removal of damaged composite from the airliner. The small gap left around the insert’s perimeter was filled with a sealant.

Next, technicians working inside the fuselage glued a splice plate to the inside surfaces, overlapping the joined edges by a few inches on each side. After vacuum bagging the repair, technicians applied thermal blankets to heat and pressurise the site for the duration of a carefully monitored and controlled cure. Heatcon controllers were used. Some joining and making good of the stringers and frames was also necessary. Mechanical fasteners were used to complement the bonding.

The cured repair was carefully evaluated, both on the ground using ultrasonic NDE and in the air with strain and other sensors during flight tests. Test results enabled Boeing to declare the repaired fuselage to be as sound as the original. Only time will tell whether this will be justified by continued integrity of the repair in the harsh conditions of a high-flying airliner constantly cycling between environmental extremes over many years.

Meanwhile, Boeing has gained valuable experience from the development and application of the ultra-large pre-cured repair patch used for this ambitious repair. Its engineers certainly knew they were breaking new ground well outside the normal scope of the SRM.

Composite patch repairs to airframes have already come some way. Aircraft manufacturers and operators, MRO specialists and research bodies will all help ensure that this crucial enabler for the economic success of extensively composite aircraft develops further yet. ♦
