"In Boeing-Airbus Rivalry, Hidden Hand of Diplomats - The New York Times","Sun, 02 Jan 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTEvMDEvMDMvYnVzaW5lc3MvMDN3aWtpbGVha3MtYm9laW5nLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This article was reported by Eric Lipton, Nicola Clark and Andrew W. Lehren and was written by Mr. Lipton.

WASHINGTON  The king of Saudi Arabia wanted the United States to outfit his personal jet with the same high-tech devices as Air Force One. The president of Turkey wanted the Obama administration to let a Turkish astronaut sit in on a NASA space flight. And in Bangladesh, the prime minister pressed the State Department to re-establish landing rights at Kennedy International Airport in New York.

Each of these government leaders had one thing in common: they were trying to decide whether to buy billions of dollars’ worth of commercial jets from Boeing or its European competitor, Airbus. And United States diplomats were acting like marketing agents, offering deals to heads of state and airline executives whose decisions could be influenced by price, performance and, as with all finicky customers with plenty to spend, perks.

This is the high-stakes, international bazaar for large commercial jets, where tens of billions of dollars are on the line, along with hundreds of thousands of high-paying jobs. At its heart, it is a wrestling match fought daily by executives at two giant companies, Boeing and Airbus, in which each controls about half of the global market for such planes."
Airbus lands largest contract in 'commercial aviation history' - FRANCE 24 English,"Wed, 12 Jan 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi8yMDExMDExMi1haXJidXMtc2F5cy1pbmRpZ28tcGxhY2VzLW1hc3NpdmUtb3JkZXItMTgwLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWJpZ2dlc3QtZGVhbC1oaXN0b3J50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"BUSINESS

France's Airbus unveiled a mega-order for its new, eco-conscious A320neo jet by the Indian airline IndiGo. The European aircraft manufacturer is calling the deal the largest of its kind in aviation history.

AFP - Indian budget airline IndiGo has signed an agreement to buy 180 Airbus A320 aircraft, the European plane maker said, in a record sale worth up to $15.6 billion (12 billion euros).

""It is the largest single firm order number for large jets in commercial aviation history,"" Airbus said in a statement, although the company has signed contracts worth more financially.

The low-cost airline has signed a memorandum of understanding to acquire 150 single-aisle A320neo jets. The neo versions -- ""new engine option"" -- are equipped with more efficient engines and fuel-saving wing tips.

IndiGo is the first client for this new version of the aircraft, which Airbus only unveiled last month and plans to start delivering in early 2016.

The other 30 planes are to be standard versions of the A320.

The value of the deal was not announced, but is expected to come in lower than the Airbus' catalogue price of $15.6 billion.

""That is a guidline price and does not take into account eventual reductions for bulk purchases,"" a source close to the deal said.

""This order for industry leading fuel efficient aircraft will allow IndiGo to continue to offer low fares,"" said Rakesh Gangwal and Rahul Bhatia, co-founders of IndiGo.

The aircraft are expected to deliver fuel savings of up to 15 percent, with corresponding cuts in pollution.

""Ordering more A320s was the natural choice to meet India's growing flying needs.

""The opportunity to reduce costs and to further improve our environmental performance through the A320neo were key to our decision,"" they said in a statement.

John Leahy, Airbus' Chief Operating Officer for Customers, said the deal gave IndiGo a strong position in the fast growing Indian air travel industry.

""This order positions IndiGo to take full advantage of the predicted growth in Indian air travel and we are delighted that they continue to build their future with Airbus,"" he said.

Airbus said it has delivered some 4,500 of the A320 aircraft in its various forms to 310 airlines, with another 1,300 on the order books, making it the world's best-selling single-aisle aircraft family.

The A320neo is Airbus' bid to counter rival aircraft such as Canada's Bombadier CSeries and China's C919, as well as heading off Boeing, which has not yet decided on the future of its medium-haul 737.

Airbus will offer airlines a choice of motors on its A320neo.

They will be able to choose between the latest model from CFM International, a joint venture between France's Safran and General Electric in the United States, and a US Pratt & Whitney engine.

IndiGo had not yet decided what engine it wanted for its models and would make an announcement at a later date, Airbus said.

Airbus Secures Biggest Order in History from India - 24/7 Wall St.,"Wed, 12 Jan 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vMjQ3d2FsbHN0LmNvbS9pbnZlc3RpbmcvMjAxMS8wMS8xMi9haXJidXMtc2VjdXJlcy1iaWdnZXN0LW9yZGVyLWluLWhpc3RvcnktZnJvbS1pbmRpYS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Secures Biggest Order in History from India

India’s low-fare airline IndiGo has placed a $15.6 billion order with European Aeronautic Defence and Space NV (OTC: EADSY) for 180 new aircraft, including 150 of EADS’s re-modeled Airbus A320. The order could push Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) to re-vamp its 737, something the company has been reluctant to do.

IndiGo is the third largest airline in India, flying domestic routes only. The airline is expected to place a firm order with EADS within two months for 30 of the company’s current A320 planes and 150 new versions of the same plane that will offer improved fuel economy. IndiGo plans to seek authorization to fly international routes in August 2011, when it will meet a mandated five years of operation as a domestic carrier.

IndiGo has not yet lined up financing for the 180 new planes, and the bulk of the order won’t begin arriving from EADS until 2016.

The supply of aircraft in India is far outstripped by the population. According to Reuters, China, with a similar-sized population, sports a fleet of 2,600 aircraft to India’s 400. Passenger traffic in India grew by 19% in 2010 to about 47 million people through November 2010, compared with about 230 million passengers in China in all of 2009.

Boeing probably did not even have a chance to win this order, which is being touted as the largest in aviation history. IndiGo already flies 32 of the Airbus A320 aircraft, and as a low-cost flier, the company has essentially standardized on a single aircraft to help cut maintenance and training costs. Think Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE: LUV).

For Boeing, which has so far been slow to upgrade its 737, the IndiGo deal with EADS could be a wake-up call. The company has been so focused on its 787 Dreamliner that it hasn’t paid a lot of attention to its cash cow. The new engines for the Airbus A320 will not fit under the wings of a Boeing 737, unless the Boeing aircraft’s ground clearance is redesigned. The more efficient engines will give Airbus a substantial boost in fuel efficiency and range. For regional or domestic carrier use, this can be a deal-maker or a deal-breaker.

A Bloomberg story notes that Boeing has said it can offer the 737 with a more efficient engine, but the company doesn’t think the business is large enough to repay the investment.

SHORT TAKE: Virgin American Launch Customer for Airbus A320neo With 30 on Order - Airline Reporter,"Wed, 19 Jan 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMS8wMS9zaG9ydC10YWtlLXZpcmdpbi1hbWVyaWNhbi1sYXVuY2gtY3VzdG9tZXItZm9yLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIwbmVvL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Virgin American has announced they are the launch customer of the new Airbus A320neo with 30 orders of the aircraft. Before the first deliveries of the A320neo start in 2016, Virgin America also has orders for 30 Airbus A320’s with sharklets. This is a huge deal for the relatively new airline.

The Airbus A320neo is the next generation of the A320 family. The aircraft will allow New Engine Options (hence “neo”) which will increase range, lower fuel costs, while allowing airlines to keep a single fleet family of A320 aircraft.

Virgin America Set to Become Airbus A320neo Launch Customer - NYCAviation - NYCAviation,"Mon, 17 Jan 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55Y2F2aWF0aW9uLmNvbS8yMDExLzAxL3Zpcmdpbi1hbWVyaWNhLXRvLWJlY29tZS1haXJidXMtYTMyMG5lby1sYXVuY2gtY3VzdG9tZXIvMTI2NTTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Virgin America announced early Monday that it will become the launch customer for the new Airbus A320neo, set to take delivery of 30 of the new aircraft in 2016.

The deal firms up an memorandum of understanding for an order of 60 Airbus jets signed by Virgin America at the Farnborough Airshow in July 2010. Thirty current-model A320s will make up the first half of the order, with deliveries to begin in 2013.

The neo version of Airbus’s wildly popular A320 aircraft, announced in 2010, is expected to deliver substantial gains in efficiency and range. Neos will burn 15 percent less fuel while emitting fewer carbon emissions while reducing operating cost. The planes will also be quieter and fly up to 500 nautical miles further than the current A320.

Virgin America’s fleet will more than triple in size when deliveries are complete, from 34 today to 111 in 2019.

“At just three years old and at a time when many carriers are contracting, we’re pleased to be growing and bringing our award-winning service to new markets,” said Virgin America President and CEO David Cush. “We credit a great deal of our success to date to having the right aircraft. The low operating costs, cabin comfort and carbon-efficient design of our all new Airbus A320 Family fleet has helped fuel our growth and success in the North American market – and we’re confident the A320neo will only build on that.”

The deal also marks a significant milestone for Airbus: the consortium’s 10,000th order.

“We hit our 5,000th order in August of 2004 – after more than 30 years. To achieve the 10,000th order just over six years later is a ringing endorsement of our product line,” said Tom Enders, Airbus President and CEO. “And to do so with Virgin America, one of our newest and trendiest customers, is very fitting. The fact that this milestone also embraces the first firm order for our new, eco-efficient A320neo is also very inspiring.”"

The risks of speedy turnarounds - Salon,"Fri, 28 Jan 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbG9uLmNvbS8yMDExLzAxLzI4L2Fpcl9hc2lhL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Dipping back into my story from the Thai islands ... about that Air Asia flight:

Air Asia is a young, low-cost carrier (LCC) headquartered in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. In less than 20 years the company has grown to become one of the biggest and most successful airlines in the region -- an equatorial Southwest of sorts.

Air Asia is unusual in that it's something of a multinational, with hubs in Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. These divisions are operated semi-autonomously (not unlike those of LAN, the highly regarded Latin American airline with bases on Chile, Peru, Argentina and Ecuador). It is also one of the few LCCs to venture into the long-haul, intercontinental realm, with a network now stretching to Europe and Iran. The track record for long-haul LCCs isn't good -- one thinks of People Express, Tower Air and Laker, all three of which failed. That was a long time ago, though, and the Asian market of 2011 is a lot different from the transatlantic market of the 1980s. Smart money says Air Asia will continue to grow and succeed.

People certainly seem to like Air Asia -- it won Skytrax World's Best LCC award for 2009 -- but my own experience, a round-trip between Bangkok and the tourist ghetto of Phuket, wasn't without its kinks.

Both flights were late, for starters, including a 60-minute delay on the outbound leg. No reasons or apologies were provided. And I was less than impressed with the Air Asia website, which at steps along the way attempts to trick the customer into purchasing add-ons he or she probably doesn't want: priority seating, insurance, etc. And when we tried to make an online reservation in Bangkok, the site would not accept any of our credit cards issued by U.S. banks, ultimately requiring a phone call to book the old-fashioned way. To encourage online booking, Air Asia adds a ""dot-com"" to its name pretty much everywhere -- in print, on the Web and in bright red paint on the flanks of its aircraft. It ought to have a friendlier interface.

As for the onboard experience, well, it was what it was: a no-frills, get-what-you-pay-for ride. The plane, an Airbus A320, was spotlessly clean, but there is something downmarket, even ugly, about the carrier's red and black interiors -- not to mention the advertisements splashed over the tray tables and overhead bins. Seat pitch is minimal, and there's a charge even for water or soft drinks. It's hard to complain when our tickets ran less than a hundred bucks each way, but 50 Thai baht for a can of Coke Zero seems a little unnecessary.

Flying out of Phuket we were delayed about 15 minutes due to our plane's tardy arrival. But it could have been worse save for a remarkably fast turnaround time. The inbound Airbus was relieved of its passengers and luggage, refueled and reboarded (with almost every seat taken), and ready to push in what couldn't have been more than 20 minutes!

Rapid turnarounds are a point of pride at Air Asia, just as they are at Southwest and other LCCs, where super-high aircraft utilization rates are part of the game, but something about a 20-minute turn makes me uneasy. The logistics of a turn are perhaps more involved than people realize. From the minute a plane docks to the point where the brakes are released for push-back, a long series of tasks has to be accomplished.

For the ground staff, those tasks include the following:

arriving passengers need to disembark with all of their carry-ons

departing passengers and their carry-ons need to be boarded

incoming luggage, mail and freight need to be offloaded

outgoing luggage, mail and freight need to loaded

the cabin needs to be cleaned and, if necessary, re-catered

the aircraft needs to be fueled in accordance with outbound flight plan

The cockpit crew, meanwhile, has its own list of chores:

complete the parking and shutdown checklists

perform an exterior walk-around inspection

receive and review updated weather for origin and destination

load the outbound flight plan into the flight management system (FMS )

receive and review the flight's air traffic control clearance (sometimes this happens after push, during taxi)

review the departure profile and set up various instruments correspondingly -- review the expected taxi route

receive weight-and-balance report and load the necessary data into the FMS

perform the pre-flight and before start checklists (covering dozens of items, typically)

take a whiz

That's a lot of moving parts. There is paperwork to deal with as well, plus communicating and coordinating with company handlers, cabin crew and ATC, as needed. Actual tasks, and the order in which they're performed, will vary, but it's never anything less than what you see above. Usually it's more. And the list above presumes there is no crew change. For pilots, a crew swap means having to stow our bags, then set up and organize our gear (charts, maps, headset and so on). This alone can take several minutes.

For perspective, I begin my preparations for a long-haul flight a good 90 minutes prior to departure. Sure, an hour-long domestic hop is different, but it's not that different, and the basic responsibilities are the same. Trying to get everything done in 20 minutes is pushing it under conditions. I am not accusing Air Asia, or anybody else, of being reckless, but as anybody knows it's easy to make mistakes when you're in a hurry. One of the basic tenets of air safety is to keep things slow, methodical and unrushed.

Airlines tend to hyperventilate when it comes to getting a plane off the gate as quickly as possible. I've never understood this. Scheduled flight times are usually padded, for one, and on-time performance is measured by arrival time not departure time.

Not that it didn't feel good getting the hell out of Phuket.

Airbus A330 tanker damaged in refuelling mishap | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Thu, 20 Jan 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWEzMzAtdGFua2VyLWRhbWFnZWQtaW4tcmVmdWVsbGluZy1taXNoYXAvOTc5NjIuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Military has launched an investigation into an in-flight refuelling mishap that damaged one of the Royal Australian Air Force's delayed A330 multi-role tanker transports (MRTT).

The aircraft was being operated by Airbus Military personnel from the company's Getafe site near Madrid, Spain when the incident happened at around 17:00 local time on 19 January. Also involved was a Lockheed Martin F-16 fighter from the Portuguese air force.

""The incident resulted in the detachment and partial loss of the refuelling boom from the MRTT,"" the Australian Department of Defence says. The separated part fell into the sea after causing ""some damage to both aircraft"", which then ""returned safely to their home airfields"", it adds.

""Airbus Military and the relevant European military airworthiness authorities will have the lead responsibility for investigating the incident,"" the DoD says. Australian experts will also participate in the process.

Designed by EADS, the MRTT's advanced refuelling boom system uses fly-by-wire controls and has an extended length of 18.2m (60ft). The system is also being installed on A330 tankers on order for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

The mishap comes at an embarrassing time for EADS North America, which is offering the A330-based KC-45 against the Boeing 767 NewGen Tanker in the US Air Force's 179-aircraft KC-X contest. Its offer draws heavily on the MRTT configuration developed for Australia.

Airbus chief executive Tom Enders describes KC-X as ""a very important business opportunity for EADS and Airbus"".

Australia will receive five MRTTs under the nation's Project Air 5402 acquisition. The first two had been due to arrive in December, but Airbus Military and the DoD are still working to complete the necessary paperwork ahead of the transfer. To be designated the KC-30A in RAAF service, the type had originally been due to enter use from mid-2009.

"Quieter, super-sized jumbo jet coming to SFO - The Mercury News","Thu, 27 Jan 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lcmN1cnluZXdzLmNvbS8yMDExLzAxLzI3L3F1aWV0ZXItc3VwZXItc2l6ZWQtanVtYm8tamV0LWNvbWluZy10by1zZm8v0gFXaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWVyY3VyeW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMTEvMDEvMjcvcXVpZXRlci1zdXBlci1zaXplZC1qdW1iby1qZXQtY29taW5nLXRvLXNmby9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After years of delay, a quieter jumbo jet will finally arrive at San Francisco International Airport.

The airport said this week that its first Airbus A380 service will launch May 10 with Lufthansa flights to Frankfurt, Germany. Capable of holding 526 passengers, the double-decker is the largest commercial aircraft on the market.

The four-engine planes are 30 percent quieter than a typical wide-body aircraft and also 12 percent more fuel-efficient, officials said. Airbus, the French company that makes the plane, claims it generates 50 percent less noise on takeoff than its nearest competitor and is three to four times quieter while landing.

The hushed airplanes, if they become commonplace for long-distance flights, as the airport hopes, should help appease Peninsula residents who for decades have complained that it’s too loud to live near the airport or under flight paths.

Officials and residents have been sparring for years over the issue, leading the airport to spend millions of dollars on noise monitoring and home insulation. But it hasn’t always worked, and Brisbane residents recently launched a campaign to quiet the noise. In the most extreme example, a litigious Hillsborough man so fed up over the racket sued the airport in 2009 saying it ruined his marriage.

SFO Director John Martin said the airport had the huge airliners in mind when it designed its International Terminal, which opened in 2000 and remains the largest international hub in North America. Airport officials thought the Airbus A380 would arrive in 2007, when the plane hit the market, but the costly aircraft did not come as soon as they had hoped.

In addition to being quieter, the “superjumbo” jets are cheaper to operate.

“Passengers flying on the A380 will be treated to world-class service and amenities both in the air and on the ground,” Martin said in a statement.

India Refloats Tender for Six new Flying Tankers - Defense Update,"Sat, 15 Jan 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5zZS11cGRhdGUuY29tLzIwMTEwMTE1X2luZGlhX3Rhbmtlci5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Indian Air Force (IAF) is seeking to buy six new flying tankers to augment its existing aerial refueling capability. The two companies are competing on this tender, expected to cost around 9,000-crore (US$2 billion) include Russia’s United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) and EADS. Both offers include the planes they put forward for the first tender. U.S. aircraft maker Boeing considered its new-generation 767 model as a possible contestant, but missed the January 12 deadline to submit its bid. Boeing cited uncertainty with the U.S. Air Force’s order for 179 aerial tankers as a reason for not entering the competition for the Indian order, which is estimated at $2 billion.

EADS is offering the A-330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport currently being delivered to Australia. The company said it will be able to deliver the first A330 MRTT within three years of signing the order, with the remaining five to be supplied up to 15 months later. The IAF currently operates 6 Ilyushin IL-78MKI. These planes are customized variants of the Il-78ME built in Uzbekistan, designed specifically for the Indian Air Force. They are fitted with a aerial refueling system designed by IAI Bedek, capable of refueling 6-8 Su-30MKIs on each sortie.

In September 2009, the Indian Finance Ministry had rejected the Indian Air Force/MoD selection of the A330 MRTT as too costly. Reports at the time suggested the final price of the A330 MRTT package for six aircraft was Rs 8,000-crore (around $1.8-billion), compared with Rs 5,000-crore ($1.12-billion) paid for the previous IL-78MKI package. However, these planes have experienced serviceability issues with the IAF, which led the service to cancel the bid, raising its requirement for the new tender.

As a side route for the Boeing 767, Israel proposed to equip India with used 767 planes, modified into military flying tankers, but the Indian Air Force insists on buying new aircraft, therefore shelving the Israeli proposal.

The Russian offer likely to be the least costly, has also gained another advantage, since it is likely to integrate the Israeli system that already has proven to work with all Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) contenders during recent flight testing carried out last summer in India. EADS is likely to offer their own refueling systems, already integrated into their respective platforms."

The premier airline, which would launch international services later this year subject to government permission, signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Airbus at Toulouse in France last evening for the 180 single-aisle aircraft.



Of these planes, 150 would belong to the eco-efficient 'neo' series, which are yet to be produced, and the remaining 30 are the standard A-320s.



They are expected to be delivered between 2016 and 2025. Engine selection for the aircraft would be announced by the airline at a later date, an Airbus spokesperson said.



Though the value of the deal was not announced, but according to Airbus catalogue price the sale is $15.6 billion or 12 billion euros.



""It is the largest single firm order for large jets in commercial aviation history,"" she said, adding it also makes IndiGo a launch customer for the A-320neo.



This is the second time IndiGo has placed such a massive aircraft order, after its first agreement with Airbus in 2005 to buy 100 A-320s when the total order was worth $6 billion. That order, the planes under which are currently in the process of being delivered, was one of the highest by any domestic carrier at the time.



The A-320neos would incorporate more efficient engines and large wing tip devices called Sharklets that would deliver significant fuel savings of up to 15 per cent and reduce emissions and engine noise, the spokesperson said.



""This order for fuel efficient aircraft will allow IndiGo to continue to offer low fares,"" said Rahul Bhatia, group managing director of InterGlobe Enterprises that runs IndiGo, and Rakesh Gangwal, its co-founder.



IndiGo President Aditya Ghosh said the additional aircraft ""will enable us to take our low fares and courteous, hassle-free service to more customers and destinations and will create more job opportunities and growth for several other aviation related businesses"".



The airline has already sought government's permission for launching global operations from the middle of this year when it completes five years of domestic service.



Ghosh had earlier said the global operations would be launched to several destinations in West Asia, besides Bangkok, Singapore, Kathmandu and the Maldives.



IndiGo recently tipped Air India for the third position in domestic market share, after Jet Airways and Kingfisher Airlines respectively.

South Korea's Asiana Airlines to buy six Airbus A380 jumbo jets - FRANCE 24 English,"Thu, 06 Jan 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi8yMDExMDEwNi1zb3V0aC1rb3JlYS1hc2lhbmEtYWlybGluZXMtYnV5LXNpeC1haXJidXMtYTM4MC1qdW1iby1qZXRz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"AVIATION

South Korea's Asiana Airlines has agreed to a $1.8 billion deal to buy six Airbus A380 jumbo jets to be used on routes to Europe and the United States, the airline said on Thursday. The planes are to be delivered between 2014 and 2017.

AFP - South Korea's Asiana Airlines said Thursday it had agreed to buy six Airbus A380 superjumbos in a deal worth $1.8 billion as it tries to cash in on booming demand from China and the rest of Asia.



The country's second-largest carrier said the European manufacturer had agreed to deliver the planes between 2014 and 2017, adding they would be used on routes to Europe and the United States.



The agreement, worth 2.04 trillion won ($1.8 billion), comes as an easing of visa rules on South Korean visitors to the United States and an ever-growing number of Chinese travellers fans demand for lucrative trans-Pacific flights.



""Long-haul flights are expected to grow by more than five percent each year due to free trade agreements (with the United States and the European Union) and the visa waiver programme,"" CEO Yoon Young-Doo said in a statement.



""We made the decision to accelerate our growth,"" he said.



The Seoul-based air carrier has largely operated short-haul routes into Asia, while its bigger rival Korean Air has long dominated the long-haul market.



The aggressive investment plan came as airline operators seek to capitalise on soaring demand from China's increasingly affluent population and to attract more Asian passengers travelling to the US and Europe.



""The ultimate goal here is attracting more travellers from China and Southeast Asia who transfer flights in Incheon airport to go the US and Europe,"" said Song Jae-Hak, analyst at Woori Investment and Securities, referring to South Korea's main international airport.



China's demand for airline services in 2010 grew nearly 40 percent from a year earlier despite the global downturn which stifled growth in industrialised markets, Song said, calling Asiana's investment plan ""doable.""



""It's about absorbing more demand from the neighbouring Asian region... and the A380 is the best option to transport the maximum number of passengers, up to 700 people for each flight,"" he said.



China's rapidly expanding economy has seen the country's aviation sector grow at a blistering pace over the past few years, with few analysts seeing any likelihood of a slowdown.



In September, Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific said it had confirmed an order for 30 long-range A350 Airbus aircraft with a book price of $7.82 billion -- the biggest single order in the carrier's history.



Industry association IATA last month warned global airline earnings for 2011 would slide amid high fuel prices and ongoing European debt crisis dampening demand.



Growth will largely come from fast-growing Asia, which will post 4.6 billion dollars in earnings in 2011, half of next year's profit, the International Air Transport Association forecasted.

Leaked embassy cables show that US diplomats aggressively pushed foreign governments to purchase Boeing airplanes, helping the US aviation giant in the bitter transatlantic battle with its European rival, Airbus.

In late 2007, the national airline of the Kingdom of Bahrain announced a huge deal to buy airplanes from European aviation giant Airbus. But only a few weeks later, Gulf Air’s decision was suddenly reversed and a new contract signing ceremony with US aerospace rival Boeing was scheduled to coincide with then US President George W. Bush’s trip to Bahrain – the first ever visit of a sitting US president. Airbus had been sidelined by backdoor dealings at the highest levels, and not even an eleventh-hour appeal by French President Nicolas Sarkozy could undo the damage. It was just one of many incidents of US diplomatic wrangling that led foreign governments to favour Boeing over Airbus. Hundreds of newly leaked cables , obtained by the US daily the New York Times, show that US diplomats have aggressively lobbied foreign governments to buy commercial jetliners built by the Seattle-based airplane manufacturer. “United States diplomats were acting like marketing agents, offering deals to heads of state and airline executives whose decisions could be influenced by price, performance and, as with all finicky customers with plenty to spend, perks,” the daily wrote. The cables describe how US diplomatic staff approached, wooed and sometimes cajoled foreign officials who were still considering whether to buy airplanes from Boeing or Airbus. The bargaining chips included not only presidential visits, but negotiations over landing rights at New York’s John F. Kennedy Airport and private jet upgrades. The leaked embassy cables shed new light on what is recognised as one of the most bitter and ongoing transatlantic commercial feuds, despite a decades-old trade agreement between US and European leaders to keep politics out of airline deals. But with billions of dollars and tens of thousands of jobs at stake US and European diplomats felt compelled to intervene, especially during an economic crisis. While it is common knowledge that diplomats intervene to promote their country’s businesses, the newly leaked cables reveal the extensive backroom negotiations propelling major multinational aviation contracts. In the case of the Gulf Air contract, it was the former US ambassador, Adam Ereli, who appealed directly to the kingdom’s crown prince to overturn the deal reached between the airline company and Airbus, even though the Airbus deal was 400 million dollars less than Boeing’s offer, the cables revealed. “Seeing that Airbus had been outmanoeuvred, France’s president, Nicolas Sarkozy, made a last minute bid to save the deal… He offered to visit Bahrain after Bush had left, but that stop-over was cancelled when the Boeing agreement was signed in January 2008,” the New York Times reported. In 2006, a senior Commerce Department official hand-delivered a personal letter from former President Bush to the Jeddah office of the Saudi King, urging him to buy 43 Boeing jets . According to the cables, the king replied in turn with a personal request: “all the technology that his friend, President Bush, had on Air Force One,” for his own private jet. According to the New York Times, the cables also suggest demands for bribes “still take place”. But the embassy documents also revealed that Boeing and US officials turned away some requests to hire intermediaries who charge illegal commissions. Boeing and Airbus each control about half of the global market for commercial jetliners, but Boeing eclipsed Airbus in net orders in 2010 , securing 484 orders against 388, according to November data. The revelations of Washington’s sales pitches for Boeing comes before a much-anticipated contract decision by the US Air Force slated for early in 2011 ; one which involves rival bids from Boeing and Europe's EADS –the European aviation and defence group that includes Airbus. The Pentagon’s plan to buy 179 tankers to renew its fleet of Eisenhower-era refuelling aircraft is worth up to 38 billion euros ($50 billion). The current contest marks the Pentagon’s third try to buy new tankers, which has been dragged out by complaints by both parties of faulty and unfair bidding practices, and claims of illegal subsidies to the aviation giants . In July 2010, the World Trade Organization partly backed a US complaint that some state support for aerospace giant Airbus is illegal. The US had complained that Airbus had received “illegal help” from the EU totalling 139 billion euros since 1967. The EU hit back saying that Boeing’s financial assistance from the US government was nearer to 300 billion euros over the same period and has launched an appeal."
Airbus Military details 'limited damage' to A330 tanker after boom mishap - Flightglobal,"Wed, 26 Jan 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLW1pbGl0YXJ5LWRldGFpbHMtbGltaXRlZC1kYW1hZ2UtdG8tYTMzMC10YW5rZXItYWZ0ZXItYm9vbS1taXNoYXAvOTgwNDMuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus Military-operated A330 multirole tanker transport (MRTT) that was involved in an in-flight refuelling training incident on 19 January suffered only ""some limited damage"", the company says.

Scheduled for delivery as part of a Royal Australian Air Force order for five MRTTs, the aircraft was supporting a Portuguese air force Lockheed Martin F-16 fighter when part of its boom was broken off.

""The boom detached at the root of the structural mast,"" says Airbus Military, responding to questions from Flightglobal. ""There is no damage to the boom attachment, nor is there any significant damage to the [aircraft's] fuselage,"" it adds.

However, the company is assessing the likely duration of limited repairs required, which it says are ""in the non-pressurised area of the tail cone and auxiliary power unit area (structure)"".

The company test crew piloting the A330 flew the aircraft for a further 1h 40min after the incident before landing at its Getafe site near Madrid. They reported ""no impact or consequences on the overall systems behaviour of the aircraft"", it notes.

The F-16 also sustained minor damage as a result of the mishap, but landed safely at Monte Real air base. The broken boom section fell into the sea following the contact.

Meanwhile, the UK's first A330-200-based Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft has cleared a significant milestone, having passed fuel for the first time via its centreline Cobham 805E fuselage refuelling unit. Airbus Military performed the test from Getafe on 21 January with the support of two Spanish air force Boeing EF-18 fighters.

""Contacts were successfully performed with both fighters at an altitude of around 15,000ft [4,570m] and at speeds from 250kt [462km/h] to 325kt,"" says Airbus Military.

New Airbus A320 NEO a 'bizarre' idea: bank - Sydney Morning Herald,"Thu, 20 Jan 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNtaC5jb20uYXUvdHJhdmVsbGVyL3RyYXZlbC1uZXdzL25ldy1haXJidXMtYTMyMC1uZW8tYS1iaXphcnJlLWlkZWEtYmFuay0yMDExMDEyMC0xOXg3Mi5odG1s0gFoaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuc21oLmNvbS5hdS90cmF2ZWxsZXIvdHJhdmVsLW5ld3MvbmV3LWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIwLW5lby1hLWJpemFycmUtaWRlYS1iYW5rLTIwMTEwMTIwLTE5eDcyLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus this week announced an order for 30 A320 NEOs from Virgin America. The Toulouse, France-based planemaker has also agreed a preliminary deal to supply 150 NEOs to New Delhi-based IndiGo. Customers will have a choice of new engines from United Technologies's Pratt & Whitney and CFM International, a venture between General Electric and Safran.

""The A320 NEO will strengthen even further the market- leading position of the A320 family as a sound long-term investment both for airlines and the financing community,"" said Sean Lee, an Airbus spokesman. ""This is already being borne out by the overwhelmingly positive reaction from the market.""

Boeing has had a difficult time making a ""compelling business case"" for fitting its 737 with new engines, Jim Albaugh, president of its commercial aeroplane operations, said this month. The Chicago-based company has said it will decide by midyear between offering new powerplants or waiting to develop a replacement aircraft.

Airbus, the world's biggest commercial plane maker, plans to begin deliveries of the A320 NEO in early 2016 and it last month predicted market potential of as many as 4000 aircraft over 15 years. A successor to the A320 won't come before the middle of next decade because materials won't be advanced enough before then to justify the development expense, the company has said.

MUMBAI: Gurgaon-based low-cost airline IndiGo has ordered 180 Airbus A320s from European aircraft manufacturer Airbus for a valuation of $15.6 billion (Rs 70,000 crore), indicating that the aviation industry is beginning to fly out of turbulence.“With this order, IndiGo has given a kick-start to aviation coming out from a downcycle,” said Kiran Rao , Executive Vice-President, Marketing and Contracts, and President India , Airbus.The deliveries are expected to begin from 2016 and continue till 2025. IndiGo currently has a fleet of 34 Airbus A320s. It flies to 24 destinations and has 221 daily flights.The national carrier, Air India, had earlier placed an order for 111 Boeing and Airbus aircraft for $11 billion in 2005. The aviation market in India has been growing at 15% and is poised to expand by 20% in the near future, surpassing booming markets such as China and Brazil.“This aircraft will allow IndiGo to continue to offer low fares,” said Rahul Bhatia, Group Managing Director, InterGlobe Enterprises, the promoter company of the airline. IndiGo, known to surprise the industry with big aircraft orders, had ordered 100 Airbus aircraft at the 2005 Paris Air Show.The budget airline has become the launch customer for A320neo (a new generation version of the A320 available to airlines from 2016). Of the 180 aircraft, 150 will be A320neos.Some aviation experts feel IndiGo’s order size is just a smart move by the airline to bargain for a better price from the manufacturer, make quick money on the sale and lease back. “Not all the 180 aircraft will be deployed by the airline. It will be more of a strategic step to managing costs and fleet optimisation,” said Mark Martin, an Indian aviation expert and Head of operations control centre at the Boeing 767 Middle East Operations.According to Airbus, IndiGo will use 100 of the 180 aircraft for fleet replacement while the remaining 80 will be used to add capacity.The Indian market has seen fierce competition between two big aircraft manufacturers, Everett, Seattle-based Boeing and Airbus, based in Toulouse, France. Boeing’s market share has slumped in the Indian market with this deal and Airbus now controls 73% of the Indian pie. “As Airbus offers more fuel-efficient aircraft, in a country like India where fuel costs are high, airlines value the fuel cost savings,” Rao said.“We expect another wave of orders for Airbus aircraft from Indian carriers this year and the next. We expect the number of Airbus A330s to double from the current 25. The number of A320s is also likely to double quickly from 150 now,” Rao added. Industry observers will be interested in the engine make chosen by IndiGo, as it is having trouble with the current engine V2500 manufactured by IAE, a joint venture between Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce.No other carrier has so far announced plans to expand the way IndiGo has done. In its turnaround business plan, which is in approval stage, national carrier Air India talks of doubling its fleet size from 115 aircraft to 248 by 2014. Kalanithi Maran-promoted SpiceJet announced a big order but that was for 30 Bombardier Q400 aircraft (of which 15 are firm orders) for regional services at about $900 million.Jet Airways, despite its talk of deploying capacity, has not placed any fresh orders yet as it is to take delivery of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which is getting delayed. Air India too has to receive its 27 Dreamliners on order.IndiGo flew 8,43,460 passengers till November 2010 and overtook national carrier Air India to emerge as India’s third-largest airline by market share. The airline has cornered 17.3% market share.IndiGo posted a net profit of Rs 550 crore for financial year 2010 with a profit margin of 25% on revenues of Rs 2,664.5 crore. The unlisted airline is also in the process of selling shares in an initial public offer and has appointed JM Financial as the arranger."

The list price of the planes is $1.1 billion but the budget airline has received a substantial discount, as is typical of most similar deals.

The announcement is an important vote of confidence in the future of the airline. Its expansion strategy had been contested by its founder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who still owns a sizeable chunk of the business.

Sir Stelios had also criticised easyJet’s relationship with Airbus, the European aeroplane manufacturer, and said that competition with Boeing should be re-engaged. He"

European based easyJet has signed a contract to buy a further 15 A320 aircraft and to convert an existing order for 20 Airbus A319s into the larger A320 model. The agreement is part of an order book which now totals 242 Airbus A320 Family aircraft, making easyJet one of the world’s largest customers for this type.

“We are pleased to announce this agreement with Airbus. It will help deliver easyJet's strategy of continued profitable growth, whilst providing even more flight capacity for our passengers. A central feature of the agreement is the flexibility it gives easyJet to vary the growth rate in its capacity to reflect economic conditions and market opportunities,"" said Carolyn McCall, easyJet Chief Executive.

“This easyJet order from a world leader in low cost air travel is a great endorsement and recognition of our state of the art A320 Family. The A320 is the industry benchmark for passenger comfort, reliability, productivity and eco-efficiency,” said John Leahy, Chief Operating Officer Customers.

Today, easyJet operates a fleet of 182 Airbus A320 family aircraft. Reflecting the airline’s ambitious expansion, easyet took delivery of its first A320 family aircraft an A319 in September 2003 and of its 100th aircraft just three and a half years later in April 2007.

Airbus invests 100 million euros a year in keeping the A320 Family technology state of the art, and maintaining it as the most fuel efficient and modern aircraft family, which delivers unrivalled operating economics and also passenger cabin comfort.

Airbus aircraft share a unique cockpit and operational commonality, allowing airlines to use the same pool of pilots, cabin crews and maintenance engineers, bringing operational flexibility and resulting in significant cost savings.

The A320 Family (A318, A319, A320 and A321) is recognised as the benchmark single-aisle aircraft family. Over 6,800 Airbus A320 Family aircraft have been ordered and over 4,500 delivered to more than 310 customers and operators worldwide, making it the world’s best-selling single-aisle aircraft family."
