How a fello'fly flight will actually work - Airbus,"Wed, 09 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIwLTA5LWhvdy1hLWZlbGxvZmx5LWZsaWdodC13aWxsLWFjdHVhbGx5LXdvcmvSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus fello’fly demonstrator project is putting the principles of wake-energy retrieval to the test as a way to reduce CO2 emissions—by between 3 and 4 million tons per year—on widebody operations. But flying two large passenger aircraft close together poses new operational challenges for the aviation ecosystem at large, requiring new procedures to be identified. Airbus has therefore signed agreements with two airline customers and three air navigation service providers (ANSPs) to tackle these challenges head on.

In the animal world, migrating geese have been benefiting from the flight technique of wake-energy retrieval—or surfing the air upwash of a leader bird—since time immemorial. And the benefits are obvious: free lift means staying aloft for longer distances with a lot less energy expenditure—pragmatic reasons that persuaded Airbus engineers to take a closer look at applying the same technique to aircraft to help airlines reduce fuel consumption.

At Airbus, this demonstrator project is called fello’fly. But while initial flight tests have yielded the prospect of 5-10% fuel savings per trip, many have wondered: how can two aircraft fly sufficiently close together to safely carry out a fello’fly operation?

The answer to that question is multi-faceted. For airlines, the main concern is understanding which two aircraft are well-suited to this collaborative activity on any given day, as well as changes to the pilot’s role in executing a new kind of operation. For ANSPs, the key focus is helping controllers safely bring two aircraft together into a shared operation while managing new air traffic control (ATC) requirements. To demonstrate the operational feasibility of the project, and identify procedures for transatlantic operations, Airbus will collaborate with Frenchbee and SAS Scandinavian Airlines, as well as France’s DSNA (Direction des Services de la Navigation Aérienne), the UK’s NATS and EUROCONTROL.

How a fello'fly flight works?

Bringing two aircraft safely together

Aircraft fly along known routes within controlled airspace, based on flight plans approved in advance by ANSPs. This air traffic management system works effectively to prevent collisions and organise air traffic flow.

In oceanic airspace, two aircraft typically need to be 30 to 50 nautical miles (55 to 90 kilometres) apart, according to today’s regulations. However, during fello’fly operations, this separation will need to be reduced to 1.5 nautical miles (3 kilometres) to reap the full benefits of wake-energy retrieval. While this sounds challenging, a pair of fello’fly aircraft will still remain ten times farther apart longitudinally than the 1,000-feet vertical separations that have been safely in practice for over two decades.

In the aviation industry, achieving our emission-reduction targets will require implementing innovative new ways to use aircraft in the skies. Our collaboration with our airline partners and ANSPs on fello’fly shows that we’re making good efforts towards these goals.

- Nick Macdonald, fello’fly Demonstrator Leader

In today’s operations, aircraft are directed by ATC to enter transatlantic routes at a specific time and altitude via a designated oceanic clearance point. Pilots then use a flight management function to direct the aircraft to arrive at the designated point at the specified time and altitude. In the case of two fello’fly aircraft, ATC will direct them to arrive at the same clearance point but on two different flight levels separated by 1,000 feet. Under the rules of today’s airspace and procedures, this is the closest aircraft can fly together.

Once both fello’fly aircraft have reached the clearance point, they will collaborate to manoeuvre into the rendez-vous position, which is when the follower aircraft is 1.5 nautical miles behind the leader aircraft and separated by 1,000 feet. From here, pilots will use flight assistance functions to move the aircraft safely to a position in the updraft where it is saving fuel through wake-energy retrieval. When both aircraft need to separate to head to their destinations, one aircraft will reposition itself into the spare flight level and inform ATC, which will again start identifying them as individual aircraft within the ATC system.

An industry-wide collaboration to solve operational challenges

But before further fello’fly flight tests can be carried out in today’s airspace, this set of procedures and actions must be defined to allow airlines and ATC to plan and execute them. And the fello’fly team has been working closely with its partner ecosystem to make it happen.

According to Nick Macdonald, fello’fly Demonstrator Leader, the objective of the collaboration is to put in place safe and practical procedures that make it possible to share wakes generated by aircraft to reduce emissions.

“In the aviation industry, achieving our emission-reduction targets will require implementing innovative new ways to use aircraft in the skies,” Nick Macdonald, fello’fly Demonstrator Leader, explains. “Our collaboration with our airline partners and ANSPs on fello’fly shows that we’re making good progress towards these goals.”

Initial flight tests have already begun. The fello’fly team and their flight test colleagues are testing pilot assistance technology—designed to ensure safety standards are optimal when flying two aircraft close together—in a programme that will lead the way to flight demonstrations in an oceanic airspace in 2021, involving airlines and ANSPs and a controlled Entry-Into-Service by 2025.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9344534277915955}",neutral,0.9344534277915955,0
Blue skies: Airbus plans for hydrogen-powered passenger jet by 2035 - Recharge,"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlY2hhcmdlbmV3cy5jb20vdHJhbnNpdGlvbi9ibHVlLXNraWVzLWFpcmJ1cy1wbGFucy1mb3ItaHlkcm9nZW4tcG93ZXJlZC1wYXNzZW5nZXItamV0LWJ5LTIwMzUvMi0xLTg3ODg4MtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"European plane manufacturer Airbus has unveiled a concept called ZEROe for three possible aircraft types that run on a mixture of hydrogen combustion and H 2 -powered fuel cells, with the goal to bring at least one zero-emission commercial airplane to the market by 2035.

One of the models unveiled looks similar to a classic commercial aircraft, except with longer, more flexible wings. Another resembles a turboprop-powered airliner with its arrangement of six-bladed propellers. And the third is a “blended-wing body”, a revolutionary design that Airbus claims has seen some traction among engineers over the last year.

“As recently as five years ago, hydrogen propulsion wasn’t even on our radar as a viable emission-reduction technology pathway,” said Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus vice president for zero-emission aircraft.

“But convincing data from other transport industries quickly changed all that. Today, we’re excited by the incredible potential hydrogen offers aviation in terms of disruptive emissions reduction.”

Air travel is responsible for 2% of worldwide carbon emissions, but aviation is a sector considered difficult to decarbonise. Batteries for larger electronic planes would be too heavy if current battery technology is used, while non-fossil synthetic fuels or green hydrogen are still very expensive.

French energy group Engie and European aerospace joint venture Ariane Group – in which Airbus owns a 50% stake – earlier this month had already signed a cooperation agreement on renewable liquid hydrogen to speed up the decarbonisation of heavy transport and airplanes.

Airbus estimates hydrogen has the potential to reduce CO 2 emissions in aviation by up to 50%.

The ZEROe concept aircraft would be powered by modified gas-turbine engines that burn liquid hydrogen as fuel. At the same time, they also use hydrogen fuel cells to create electrical power that complements the gas turbine, resulting in a highly efficient hybrid-electric propulsion system, the manufacturer explained.

“Hydrogen has a different volumetric energy density than jet fuel so we have to study other storage options and aircraft architectures than existing ones,” said Jean-Brice Dumont, Airbus EVP Engineering.

“This means the visual appearance of our future zero-emission aircraft will change. These three configurations provide us with some exciting options for further exploration.”

Each of the three options Airbus has unveiled have a slightly different approach to integrating the liquid hydrogen storage and distribution system:

In the Turbofan model two hybrid turbofan engines provide thrust. The liquid hydrogen storage and distribution system is located behind the rear pressure bulkhead.

Airbus expects a zero-emission commercial aircraft to roll off its assembly lines for entry into service by 2035, if hydrogen technology development progresses at the expected rate.

According to its plan, the plane maker will need to launch the ZEROe aircraft programme by 2025. That gives the company’s engineers about five years to mature all the required hydrogen technologies.

Over the coming months, several hydrogen demonstrator programmes, which will test hydrogen fuel cell and hydrogen combustion technologies respectively, are estimated to be formally launched. A full-scale aircraft prototype is estimated to arrive by the late 2020s.

“At the same time, they also use hydrogen fuel cells to create electrical power that complements the gas turbine, resulting in a highly efficient hybrid-electric propulsion system.”

Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury says the ZEROe concepts mark a “historic moment” for the commercial aviation sector, the BBC reports. And the use of hydrogen had the potential to “significantly reduce aviation’s climate impact”, by reducing carbon emissions, he added.

The combination of the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change and jet fuel price hikes has seen the aviation sector hit a turbulent patch in recent years.

In late June, after calculating the economic costs of what the Financial Times describes as this “difficult time”, Airbus announced plans to cut around 15,000 jobs - including 1,700 in the UK - from its commercial aircraft division by mid-2021.

But despite the many challenges facing the sector, Airbus engineers are focusing on developing their new “greener” aircraft.

Presenting the new designs, Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus VP Zero-Emission Aircraft, said: “As recently as five years ago, hydrogen propulsion wasn’t even on our radar as a viable emission-reduction technology pathway. Today, we’re excited by the incredible potential hydrogen offers aviation in terms of disruptive emissions reduction.”

Airbus has unveiled plans to produce the world's first zero-emission commercial planes to run on hydrogen by 2035.

The European aerospace company on Monday released three different aircraft concepts, each exploring a different approach to achieving zero-emission flight but all relying on hydrogen as a primary power source.

""This is a historic moment for the commercial aviation sector as a whole and we intend to play a leading role in the most important transition this industry has ever seen,"" Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said in a statement.

'Exciting options'

The first concept could carry between 120 and 200 passengers across some 2,000 nautical miles. The turbofan design would be powered by a modified gas-turbine engine running on hydrogen, rather than jet fuel, through combustion.

The second concept, a turboprop design, would carry up to 100 passengers over 1,000 nautical miles, while the third one, a ""blended-wing body"" design, would welcome up to 200 passengers for a 2,000 nautical miles trip.

""Hydrogen has a different volumetric energy density than jet fuel so we have to study other storage options and aircraft architectures than existing ones"" Jean-Brice Dumont, Airbus EVP Engineering, said.

""This means the visual appearance of our future zero-emission aircraft will change. These three configurations provide us with some exciting options for further exploration,"" he went on

Airbus engineers are to start working on hydrogen demonstrator programmes over the coming months to test hydrogen fuel cell and hydrogen combustion technologies with the aim to have a full-scale aircraft prototype ready by the late 2020s.

""As recently as five years ago, hydrogen propulsion wasn't even on our radar as a viable emission-reduction technology pathway, Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus VP, Zero-Emission Aircraft, noted.

""But convincing data from other transport industries quickly changed all that. Today, we're excited by the incredible potential hydrogen offers aviation in terms of disruptive emissions reduction,"" he added.

€430 billion

Direct emissions from aviation account for about three per cent of the European Union's total greenhouse gas emissions and more than two per cent of global emissions, according to the EU Commission.

In 2020, global annual international aviation emissions are around 70 per cent higher than in 2005 and they could grow by a further 300 per cent by 2050.

The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) estimates that that it will be physically possible to meet 100 per cent of international jet fuel demand with sustainable aviation fuels by 2050 and that this would correspond to a 63 per cent reduction in emissions.

It cautions however that ""this level of fuel production could only be achieved with extremely large capital investments in sustainable aviation fuel production infrastructure,T and substantial policy support.""

Faury stressed on Monday that ""decisive action from the entire aviation ecosystem"" as well as ""support from government and industrial partners"" will be needed for the company to reach its 2035 target.

The EU aims to become the world's first carbon-neutral region by 2050 and has made hydrogen a cornerstone of its strategy.

Hydrogen is a gas that makes up 75 per cent of the universe and which does not emit any carbon dioxide when used but it is difficult to isolate. A new European Clean Hydrogen Alliance aims to invest €430 billion until 2030 to scale up the hydrogen value chain across the Old Continent.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9203314781188965}",neutral,0.9203314781188965,0

Airbus is looking to a cleaner future for the commercial aircraft industries, where hydrogen powers the (local) zero-emissions aircraft of tomorrow.

With today's reveal of three designs collectively known as the ZEROe concepts, the company is looking to be at the front of the effort to decarbonize the aviation industry, and it is aiming to bring the first hydrogen-fueled aircraft into service as soon as 2035.

""This is a historic moment for the commercial aviation sector as a whole and we intend to play a leading role in the most important transition this industry has ever seen,"" Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said. ""The concepts we unveil today offer the world a glimpse of our ambition to drive a bold vision for the future of zero-emission flight. I strongly believe that the use of hydrogen – both in synthetic fuels and as a primary power source for commercial aircraft – has the potential to significantly reduce aviation's climate impact.""

A turbofan passenger aircraft capable of carrying up to 200 for more than 2,000 nautical miles Airbus

At this stage, as you would expect, details are scant but we do know that one of the concepts is based around a turbofan design that's expected to have a range of over 2,000 nautical miles (2,300 mi/3,700 km) and will be capable of carrying between 120 and 200 passengers. Gas-turbine engines will be modified to run on liquid hydrogen instead of jet fuel, with the hydrogen stored in tanks located behind the rear pressure bulkhead.

Pitched as being ideal for short hops, the turboprop concept can carry up to 100 passengers for over 1,000 nautical miles Airbus

Next up is a 100-passenger aircraft that will use turboprops instead of a turbofan design. Again, it will employ modified gas-turbine engines but is aimed at short hops, having an expected range of 1,000 nm (1,150 mi/1,852 km) or more.

Airbus is working on a number of hydrogen-fueled clean aircraft, including this blended wing concept Airbus

The third concept offered up by Airbus is arguably the most visually striking. Designed to transport up to 200 passengers, this aircraft sports a ""blended-wing body"" that allows for numerous fuel storage and cabin layout configurations. It features a turbofan array to the rear, and is expected to be capable of flying over 2,000 nm.

Such environment-friendly flyers would certainly help to clean up our skies, but as we have noted previously, the production of hydrogen ""can vary from the relatively green (electrolysis of fresh water using solar or wind-based energy) to the profoundly filthy (gasification of brown coal) – and the filthiest are by far the cheapest.""

While there are promising signs for the production of clean, green hydrogen in the years ahead, Airbus also recognizes that new support infrastructures for an aviation industry fueled by hydrogen will be needed too – including scaling up hydrogen production, and investing in transport and refueling infrastructure.

""The transition to hydrogen, as the primary power source for these concept planes, will require decisive action from the entire aviation ecosystem,"" added Faury. ""Together with the support from government and industrial partners we can rise up to this challenge to scale-up renewable energy and hydrogen for the sustainable future of the aviation industry.""

Opinion: A Five-Part Strategy For Airbus - Aviation Week,"Tue, 01 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9hZXJvc3BhY2UvcHJvZ3JhbS1tYW5hZ2VtZW50L29waW5pb24tZml2ZS1wYXJ0LXN0cmF0ZWd5LWFpcmJ1c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For the two big commercial aircraft OEMs, the next few years will be very tough going. It will be important for them to maintain a strategic plan, a list of goals and directions beyond mere survival. In July, Kevin Michaels’ column provided a definitive list of Boeing’s priorities (July 27-Aug. 13, p. 10). Here is my equivalent strategic priorities list for Airbus:

(1) Make a tough twin-aisle choice. Airbus A350-XWB output is falling quickly, probably by at least 50%. Meanwhile, Airbus’ other twin-aisle, the A330neo, has an extremely weak orderbook and faces years of two-per-month production rates. The two aircraft are not all that different in terms of capabilities and price point. Airbus must decide whether to bolster A350XWB sales by killing the A330, which would end a profitable long-running program but rationalize production, saving money.

This decision largely comes down to Delta Air Lines, the only truly strategic (and healthy) A330neo customer. Since Delta is also an A350XWB customer, consolidating these orders should not be a problem. Airbus also needs to consult with Rolls-Royce, the engine prime on both programs, since Airbus needs to be mindful of Rolls’ health.

(2) Maintain aircraft design capabilities. Overall, Airbus’ product portfolio is in better shape than Boeing’s, since the latter company is heavily dependent on the 737-8 for its single-aisle market standing, while Airbus enjoys a strong presence throughout its narrowbody product line. It will be easy for Airbus to become complacent and coast on this product lineup, though, jeopardizing its strong design capabilities.

So far, unlike Boeing, Airbus has not announced serious R&D budget cuts. Yet it is not really clear what its engineers are doing: Airbus has not had an active new commercial development program since the A350-1000 entered service in February 2018. Factory digitization, green initiatives and ancillary aviation concepts are not the same as designing a new jet. Some kind of new program—even just a stretched A220-500—is essential to keep jet design and integration skills intact.

(3) Rejuvenate defense. Two decades ago, Airbus (and predecessor EADS) defense programs were all about to hit their stride. The A400M transport, Eurofighter/Typhoon, Tiger and NH90 helicopters and others had promising futures. Today, these platforms are winding down, with dwindling backlogs.

There are few new European programs, and the most important by far, the Franco-German-Spanish Future Combat Air System, has been given to Dassault. Dassault has a strong fighter culture and is not famous for cooperating with other primes.

For Airbus, the challenge is clear: It must motivate political leaders to create new programs, get more work on existing programs or promote military derivatives of civil platforms such as the KC-30 tanker or H160M helicopter.

(4) Preserve a global production strategy. Boeing has six final production lines in three sites: Renton (737) and Everett (777/777X, 767/KC-46, 787, 747) in Washington, and Charleston (787) in South Carolina. The Boeing 747 line is closing, and one 787 line is likely to close, leaving four lines. Airbus has nine lines in five sites: Toulouse (A320, A330, A350, A380); Hamburg, Germany (A320/321); Mobile, Alabama (A220, A320/321); Tianjin, China (A320/321); and Montreal (A220). This line proliferation represents high fixed costs, and in a downturn there will be some temptation to rationalize these sites.

But in many cases, particularly in China and the U.S., secondary lines have helped to circumvent protectionist trade barriers. While the A330neo may be on the chopping block and the A380 is dying, Airbus would be well-advised to preserve the other seven lines, despite the overhead.

(5) Leverage better supplier relations. With Partnering for Success and other initiatives, Boeing has been squeezing its suppliers’ margins by demanding price concessions, aftermarket rights and lengthened payment terms. The results are a weakened supply chain and a lot of alienation.

Airbus can take advantage of Boeing’s aggressive approach by quietly telling suppliers that it will offer better terms and conditions in exchange for superior and more innovative products. This approach could mean that the next generation of Airbus jets will be more competitive than Boeing’s, since Airbus’ will be enabled by best-in-class subsystems and technologies that surpass what Boeing’s aggrieved suppliers are willing to provide.

The COVID-19 downturn will be brutal. But if Airbus prioritizes long-term outcomes, it will come out of it stronger than ever.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.48703619837760925}",positive,0.48703619837760925,1

Airbus's new program will launch in 2025 and follows a teaser appearance in July.

The three designs represent progressively further-future looks for hydrogen aircraft.



After teasing hydrogen innovation in a July panel, Airbus has released prototypes of a line of hydrogen aircraft, including a passenger airliner, a prop-boosted plane, and a wild stealth-looking little blended wing the company says represents the farther future of passenger aircraft.

✈ You like badass planes. So do we. Let's nerd out over them together.

At that panel , Airbus’s vice president for zero emissions technology said he believed hydrogen made sense as a stepping stone from fossil fuels, and suggested pulling up automotive technology to help give aeronautics engineers a little bit of a head start. Now, Airbus has shared three prototypes, just one of which looks like a familiar airliner silhouette:

Airbus The turbofan, turboprop, and blended-wing body configurations are all powered by hydrogen propulsion.

The first concept aircraft is a traditional-looking passenger airliner that Airbus says will carry between 100 and 200 passengers—so in the range of the Airbus A318 or A319 up to the Airbus 310 or comparable, and including the range of the perennially popular Boeing 737.

You'll Love This The Flying Wing of the Future

This airliner, Airbus says, will have a traditional engine setup that will run on liquid hydrogen instead of today’s jet fuel. Presumably to head off concerns about combustion, Airbus says the hydrogen will be stored at the extreme rear end of the plane: “behind the rear pressure bulkhead,” CNBC reports .

The second concept is smaller than the first, but also uses blended propulsion with powerful turboprop engines supported by hydrogen fuel. It also has broader wing blades mounted from the top or shoulder of the plane and a T-top tail. The overall design looks kind of like the De Havilland Canada Dash 8 , which dates back to 1983, but has been made in its largest-ever size since 1999.

The third concept is where all comparisons fail—it’s a blended wing that Airbus says will be able to carry as many as 200 passengers. To date, there are no production blended wings that carry passengers.

Most have been prototypes or concepts, and different military projects have made modified versions for real life. The Airbus image looks more like the shuttlecraft seen on major science fiction TV shows, with a bulbous cabin chased by sleek, tiny wings.

Airbus

Airbus explains this concept:

“The exceptionally wide interior opens up multiple options for hydrogen storage and distribution. Here, the liquid hydrogen storage tanks are stored underneath the wings. Two hybrid hydrogen turbofan engines provide thrust.”

CNBC says Airbus’s concept planes “could enter service by the year 2035,” but Airbus’s own language is more circumspect.

Through this program, the coalition of three geospatial organizations will bring new technologies and transparency to advance the mission of Norway’s International Climate and Forests Initiative (NICFI). This contract, valued up to 405M NOK (~$43.5M, ~37M ‎€), is designed to protect the world’s tropical forests and provide sustainable pathways to economic development for forest communities and countries.

“This will revolutionize global forest monitoring. Better insight into what is happening in the rainforests will enhance efforts to protect these priceless ecosystems”, says Sveinung Rotevatn, Norway’s Minister of Climate and Environment.

This unique and distinct partnership between the public and private sectors is the result of a comprehensive public procurement process led by Norway, with the ambition to utilize technology and data to help facilitate solutions towards the global challenge of tropical deforestation. Planet will provide high-resolution (sub-5m per pixel) Basemaps of the full tropics, covering over 64 developing countries, updated every month. These will be freely available for anyone to view and use through Norway’s technology partners like Global Forest Watch. Additionally, beginning in mid-October, anyone will be able to download the analysis-ready monthly Basemaps of these regions through Planet’s online satellite imagery platform, Planet Explorer, for the purpose of supporting NICFI’s mission. Planet, KSAT and Airbus will also work with select Norwegian partners to share the original image data, providing key global science and policy leaders with Planet’s daily imagery and Airbus’s unique high-resolution archive.

“Revolutionizing satellite data so we could see deforestation happening fast enough to stop it was one of the key reasons we founded Planet nine years ago,” said Will Marshall, CEO and co-founder of Planet. “We are honored to partner with Norway, KSAT and Airbus on this global crisis. Norway has taken a systematic approach to measuring natural capital in the key area of tropical forests, demonstrating the way to enable the transition to a sustainable economy.”

This comprehensive offer is part of a team led by KSAT, the world-leading provider of Ground Station services and Earth Observation products drawing from the largest portfolio of satellites, who is the first point of contact and technical support for this Contract.

Aerospace industry pioneer Airbus is also on the team and is uniquely positioned to contribute to the project with its huge archive of SPOT high resolution imagery, dating back to 2002-2015. Airbus’ SPOT satellites paved the way for the commercial use of satellite images by allowing coverage of large areas in record time for this resolution. This imagery archive represents a unique historical heritage at this scale to monitor the evolution of our planet over time.

“Our satellites have been monitoring the Earth for over thirty-five years, supporting a wide range of environmental initiatives fighting deforestation. Our unique library of millions of square kilometers of imagery, built over decades, is a key asset in the fight against deforestation,” said François Lombard, head of Intelligence Business at Airbus Defence and Space. “Indeed our SPOT 5 archive will allow users to go back in time and understand the processes that led to the current situation, in order to help prevent them from happening again in the future.”

One of the most compelling cases for these joint technical capabilities is monitoring and measuring forests by working with leaders in the international community. Satellite imagery is currently being utilized by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to monitor and protect the forests in Chile, Colombia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Costa Rica, Ghana, Indonesia, Mexico and Mozambique. While Global Forest Watch is providing access to geospatial data to the public through the NICFI contract, it’s also working with the Forest Development Authority in Liberia, Amazon Conservation Association (ACA) and many more. It is clear that a global coalition is required to make a considerable impact on the 28 million hectares of forests being cut down every year while working to protect what is left.

“We are pleased to bring together two industry-leading providers of optical satellite imagery in this disruptive initiative by NICFI and the Norwegian Ministry of Climate and the Environment. By providing high resolution satellite images and making them publicly available, KSAT will contribute to a needed transparency with the goal to stop global deforestation,” said Rolf Skatteboe, president and CEO of KSAT. “This contract is important to KSAT and our joint effort aligns perfectly with our other global environmental monitoring and protection initiatives.”

Airbus reveals plans for zero-emission aircraft fuelled by hydrogen - The Guardian,"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIwL3NlcC8yMS9haXJidXMtcmV2ZWFscy1wbGFucy16ZXJvLWVtaXNzaW9uLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWZ1ZWxsZWQtaHlkcm9nZW7SAW1odHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMC9zZXAvMjEvYWlyYnVzLXJldmVhbHMtcGxhbnMtemVyby1lbWlzc2lvbi1haXJjcmFmdC1mdWVsbGVkLWh5ZHJvZ2Vu?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has announced plans for the world’s first zero-emission commercial aircraft models that run on hydrogen and could take to the skies by 2035.

The European aersospace company revealed three different aircraft concepts that would be put through their paces to find the most efficient way to travel long distances by plane without producing the greenhouse gas emissions responsible for global heating.

UK holidaymakers and business travellers could fly from London to the Canary Islands, Athens or eastern Europe without producing carbon emissions, should the plans become a commercial reality.

Guillaume Faury, the Airbus chief executive, said the “historic moment for the commercial aviation sector” marks the “most important transition this industry has ever seen”.

“The concepts we unveil today offer the world a glimpse of our ambition to drive a bold vision for the future of zero-emission flight. I strongly believe that the use of hydrogen – both in synthetic fuels and as a primary power source for commercial aircraft – has the potential to significantly reduce aviation’s climate impact,” he said.

All three of the aircraft concepts rely on hydrogen as a fuel because the only emissions produced when it is burned is water vapour, making it a clean fuel option for heavy vehicles such as planes, trains and trucks.

The first of the Airbus concepts could carry between 120 and 200 passengers more than 2,000 nautical miles by using a turbofan design that includes a modified gas-turbine engine running on hydrogen, rather than jet fuel, which could be stored in tanks located behind the plane’s rear pressure bulkhead.

The second concept, a turboprop design, would also use a modified gas engine but could carry up to 100 passengers for 1,000 nautical miles on short-haul trips.

The aviation giant’s plans also include a plane with an “exceptionally wide” body that blends into the plane’s wings to open up multiple options for hydrogen storage and the cabin layout. This plane could carry as many passengers as the turbofan design and travel as far too.

Faury said the design options would help the aircraft maker mature plans for what would become “the world’s first climate-neutral, zero-emission commercial aircraft”, which it planned to have in service by 2035. Huge investment in infrastructure would be required to make hydrogen planes a reality, he said.

Grazia Vittadini, the chief technology officer at Airbus, said the “very ambitious” development plan would yield its first results by the middle of next year, and a final concept would be chosen by 2025. It did not rule out exploring the possibility of producing electric aircraft in the future, she said, but it could happen on a smaller scale and using different models.

In the decades ahead, the shift from traditional fossil fuel gas to hydrogen is expected to help shrink the carbon footprint of the transport sector, as well as heavy industry and even home heating and cooking hobs, as governments attempt to build carbon neutral economies.

The promise of a low-carbon economy has triggered plans to upgrade existing gas infrastructure to use hydrogen, and to produce the gas in a sustainable way.

Vittadini said the safety of its hydrogen distribution systems would be a priority for Airbus, and also stressed the need to lower the cost of “green hydrogen” to help aviation have the smallest carbon footprint possible.

Hydrogen can be made by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen particles using an electrolyser machine powered by renewable electricity, or even nuclear energy. But it can also be made from fossil fuel gas in a process that releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, meaning it would not be a clean energy source without using carbon capture technology during the process.

Airbus said hydrogen planes would also require airports to install hydrogen transport and refuelling infrastructure, and government support to upgrade aircraft fleets to allow airlines to retire their older, less environmentally friendly aircraft sooner than planned.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9993129968643188}",neutral,0.9993129968643188,0
These new Airbus concept aircraft have one thing in common - Airbus,"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIwLTA5LXRoZXNlLW5ldy1haXJidXMtY29uY2VwdC1haXJjcmFmdC1oYXZlLW9uZS10aGluZy1pbi1jb21tb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By 2035, the world’s first zero-emission commercial aircraft could take to the skies. To bring this vision to reality, Airbus is exploring game-changing concept aircraft – known as ZEROe – powered by hydrogen, a disruptive zero-emission technology with the potential to reduce aircraft emissions by up to 50%.

At first glance, the three recently unveiled Airbus “concept” aircraft offer little more than a sense of déja vu. One looks remarkably similar to a classic commercial aircraft – except with longer, more flexible wings. Another resembles a turboprop-powered airliner with its arrangement of eight-bladed propellers. And the third is a “blended-wing body,” a revolutionary design that has seen some traction among engineers over the last year.

But upon closer inspection, the trio features one game-changing difference compared to predecessors: hydrogen propulsion.

“As recently as five years ago, hydrogen propulsion wasn’t even on our radar as a viable emission-reduction technology pathway,” explains Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus Vice President, Zero-Emission Aircraft. “But convincing data from other transport industries quickly changed all that. Today, we’re excited by the incredible potential hydrogen offers aviation in terms of disruptive emissions reduction.”

That is indeed the objective. Airbus recently announced its ambition to develop the world’s first zero-emission commercial aircraft by 2035. This means only the most disruptive zero-emission technology to reduce the aviation industry’s climate impact will need to be rigorously tested and evaluated. And hydrogen certainly stands out from the pack: according to internal calculations, Airbus estimates hydrogen has the potential to reduce aviation’s CO2 emissions by up to 50%.

Three game-changing concepts for future aircraft

In aircraft, there are two broad types of hydrogen propulsion: hydrogen combustion and hydrogen fuel cells. Airbus’ three zero-emission “concept” aircraft – known as ZEROe – are all hybrid-hydrogen aircraft. This means they are powered by modified gas turbine engines that burn liquid hydrogen as fuel. At the same time, they also use hydrogen fuel cells to create electrical power that complements the gas turbine, resulting in a highly efficient hybrid-electric propulsion system. However, each option has a slightly different approach to integrating the liquid hydrogen storage and distribution system. Airbus engineers have conceptualised integration solutions that carefully take into account the challenges and possibilities of each type of aircraft.

As recently as five years ago, hydrogen propulsion wasn’t even on our radar as a viable emission-reduction technology pathway. Today, we’re excited by the incredible potential hydrogen offers aviation in terms of disruptive emissions reduction.

- Glenn Llewellyn, Vice President, Zero Emission Aircraft

Turbofan: Two hybrid-hydrogen turbofan engines provide thrust. The liquid hydrogen storage and distribution system is located behind the rear pressure bulkhead.

Turboprop: Similar to the turbofan aircraft, this concept’s liquid hydrogen storage and distribution system is located behind the rear pressure bulkhead. However, six hybrid-hydrogen turboprop engines, which drive the eight-bladed propellers, provide thrust.

Blended-Wing Body (BWB): This configuration features an exceptionally wide interior, thereby opening up multiple options for hydrogen storage and distribution. In this example, the liquid hydrogen storage tanks are stored underneath the wings. Like the turbofan aircraft, two hybrid-hydrogen turbofan engines provide thrust.

“Hydrogen has a different volumetric energy density than jet fuel, so we have to study other storage options and aircraft architectures than existing ones,” explains Jean-Brice Dumont, Airbus Executive Vice President, Engineering. “This means the visual appearance of our future zero-emission aircraft will change. These three configurations provide us with some exciting options for further exploration.”

The world’s first zero-emission commercial aircraft by 2035

If hydrogen technology development progresses at the expected rate, Airbus’ highly anticipated zero-emission commercial aircraft is expected to roll off the assembly line for entry-into-service by 2035.

To meet this ambitious 2035 target, Airbus will need to launch the ZEROe aircraft programme by 2025. This time frame gives Airbus engineers approximately five years to mature all the required hydrogen technologies. Over the coming months, several hydrogen demonstrator programmes – which will test hydrogen fuel cell and hydrogen combustion technologies respectively – are estimated to be formally launched. A full-scale aircraft prototype is estimated to arrive by the late 2020s.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.996288537979126}",neutral,0.996288537979126,0

Comac C919: China takes on Airbus and Boeing - CNN,"Fri, 04 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvY29tYWMtYzkxOS1jaGluYS1haXJidXMtYm9laW5nL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAUVodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi90cmF2ZWwvYXJ0aWNsZS9jb21hYy1jOTE5LWNoaW5hLWFpcmJ1cy1ib2Vpbmc?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CNN —

In a year of startling upheaval for the aviation industry, one seismic change, at least, had already been predicted.

For years, China has been en route to become the world’s biggest aviation market, eclipsing the United States. The International Air Transport Association predicted it would happen by 2024, but it seems the Covid-19 crisis has fast-tracked the takeover.

China snatched the crown of largest country market in May 2020, according to data from aviation analysts OAG, and, while the US sputters, IATA now says that China “continues to lead the global recovery of aviation activity.”

This aligns well with the country’s “Made in China 2025” strategy, which aims to bolster domestically designed and manufactured products. For China’s aviation ecosystem, this means less reliance on buying foreign airplanes.

Underpinning this transition is a huge migrational shift of China’s workforce towards urban centers, which, at least before the pandemic, was generating a burgeoning demographic of middle-class consumers with higher disposable incomes and an insatiable appetite for air travel.

As of the beginning of this year, more than 200 extra airports were scheduled to be built in China over the next 15 years to cope with the relentless growth spurt. And, not so long ago, Boeing’s 2019-2038 Commercial Market Outlook was saying that China would require 8,090 new passenger aircraft deliveries plus associated support services over the next 20 years – a market that Boeing estimated as being worth $2.9 trillion.

Meanwhile, transportation dots are finally being joined up across the country’s vast expanse, helping to drive the extraordinary scale of China’s infrastructural ambitions.

“China has become criss-crossed with direct domestic air routes,” says Cristiano Ceccato, director of Zaha Hadid Architects, the firm behind the recently opened Beijing Daxing International Airport.

“This fine-grain reticulum of connectivity mirrors China’s High Speed Rail network and reflects the exponential growth in need for small and medium-sized airliners which can satisfy the traveling public’s demand for safe, fast and inexpensive means of travel.”

International airliner with Chinese character

The latest analysis by IATA estimates that global passenger traffic won’t return to pre-Covid-19 levels until 2024.

Against that backdrop, China is likely to remain a strong power against a weakened United States and Europe as they face ongoing lockdowns and travel restrictions due to new localized spikes of the coronavirus.

As aviation tentatively reboots, Boeing and its European rival Airbus are duking it out for the lion’s share of the recovering market with their B737 and A320 airplanes respectively – a dynamic that’s contingent upon Boeing resolving its 737 MAX woes.

Meanwhile, China has developed – and is now at the stage of flight testing – a homegrown contender, the COMAC (Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China) C919.

All three competing aircraft have comparable specifications. They’re all single-aisle, twin-engined aircraft with a seating capacity for between 150 and 180 passengers (depending on class configuration) and are suitable for servicing domestic and regional routes – exactly the flight envelope of the bulk of China’s aviation networks.

“The COMAC C919 is designed to be an ‘international airliner with Chinese characteristics,’” says Ceccato. “This means an ability to match the quality and safety established by Boeing and Airbus, but also by incorporating the specific needs of the Chinese market: High-density, high-frequency missions with fast turnaround times from airfields with broadly varying levels of development.”

The C919 has a range of up to 5,555 kilometers and has garnered a running total of 815 orders from 28 customers, predominantly Chinese airlines. That could put a serious dent in the order books of their incumbent suppliers.

At a time when many Western carriers have been parking their planes in the desert and deferring or canceling airplane deliveries from manufacturers, COMAC’s order book was boosted by the formation in February of OTT Airlines, a new China Eastern Airlines subsidiary.

The plan is that OTT will be a launch customer for the C919, with the carrier operating on trunk and regional routes, focused around the Yangtze River Delta region and radiating out towards the surrounding provinces.

But what sets the COMAC plane apart from its Western rivals in terms of the in-flight experience?

The Airbus A320 was launched in 1984. Airbus

The French connection

While the major elements of the airplane such as the nose, fuselage, outer wing, vertical stabilizer, horizontal stabilizer and movable surfaces have been independently designed by COMAC, the company has enlisted Western expertise, notably that of French high-tech industrial group and aero-engine manufacturer Safran, which is producing the aircraft’s cabin and nacelles (the structure that houses the engines and connects them to the wings).

The C919’s LEAP-1C engines are being produced by CFM, a joint venture between US engine-maker GE Aviation and Safran.

Subsidiary Safran Cabin says it will supply the lavatories, galleys, and cockpit doors for the C919. The company told CNN that “the lavatories are larger than what is now commonly seen on competing aircraft.”

That will be welcome news for passengers forced to do contortions in modern airplane toilet compartments.

More spacious lavatories would mean it would be possible to move around with less contact with surfaces, and it could also make cleaning and maintenance a less onerous task for the crew that scramble on board between flights to disinfect the toilets – a boon in the Covid era.

Larger restrooms aren’t the only difference. The back of the aircraft will feature a full-sized galley with ample space for the flight crew to work. Safran says it “recognizes that many of its airline partners based in China will fly these aircraft on short routes within China, which makes meal service a challenge.”

To address the compressed flight times on domestic routes, Safran says its cabin designers have come up with an “ergonomic galley design, with large work surfaces, equipped with easy-to-maneuver ‘Hybrite S trolleys,’ which help the crew get meals, snacks and drinks out to passengers quickly.”

Spacious galleys are also likely to be a selling point worldwide as airlines work towards complying with new inflight catering guidelines set out by the Airline Catering Association (ACA).

For reasons of heightened food-handling standards introduced in response to the pandemic, airlines are now switching to touchless on board food service. This means a lot more packaging, which in turn means a need for extra gallery space. The C919’s galleys conveniently tick that box.

As for environmental concerns, Safran says it “has made advancements in its composite structures which enable interiors to be both lightweight and durable, helping to reduce carbon footprint while withstanding the rigors of short-haul service.”

The aircraft’s engines are also claimed to be more efficient. The CFM LEAP-1C engine, which was selected by COMAC as the sole Western engine option for the C919, offers “a 15% reduction in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions versus current engines, and up to a 50% margin on NOx emissions,” says Safran. The engines will also mitigate noise in and around the airports where the C919 operates.

Safran’s involvement in the C919 program is hardly surprising. The company has been trading with China for over a century and has formed strong ties with the leading companies in the Chinese aviation industry, and today supplies all the major Chinese airlines.

It also has established specialized maintenance and repair facilities with major Chinese airlines such as Air China and China Eastern Airlines.

When can we fly in it?

COMAC has built a fleet of six prototype versions of the C919 that have been pacing through flight testing programs.

The first prototype made its maiden flight in 2017 and the most recent publicly declared flight test took place, despite the Covid-19 crisis, in February 2020, when prototype AC106 took off and landed at Dongying Shengli Airport.

Although the test aircraft are clocking up the air miles, no official date for the C919’s first entry into passenger service has been announced. Speculation about time frames has proved, in the past, to be optimistic. When first launched in 2008, the program had slated 2014 for a first test flight, but this slipped to 2017.

Late 2021 or early 2022 is now being mooted as a possibility for commercial operations, but a mix of factors could impede that.

The outcome of the US elections could influence America’s deteriorating relations with China – either for better or worse, which in turn could have ramifications over the export of CFM engines.

CFM partner GE Aviation recently, as reported by CNN, “dodged a bullet” by being granted permission to export the LEAP 1C to China, despite US national security concerns that the engine technology could be reverse-engineered.

Then there’s the broader context of the ongoing pandemic, which has bludgeoned public inclination towards nonessential air travel.

There’s also the question of whether a new narrow body entrant would have sufficient market demand while there’s a glut of unused short-and-medium-haul airplane capacity parked, airworthy and ready for reactivation at short notice. Attractive deals on nearly new 737s and A320s is a distinct possibility – a consequence of airline fleet cutbacks.

Finally, on a technical level, the COMAC C919 flight test regime and associated certification for airworthiness could be delayed due to unforeseen glitches that are part and parcel of developing any new type of airliner.

Clearly, Comac’s C919 still has some way to go, especially in uncertain times. But if successful, longer term, a third option for aviation’s short- and medium-haul market, as air travel emerges from the pandemic, could significantly redistribute the balance of power in civil aviation.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9793339967727661}",neutral,0.9793339967727661,0

By removing the largest single variable cost from aviation — jet fuel — there is an expectation that the necessary green future will also be more economically efficient. For an electric future of propulsion powered by batteries, the economics of flying have the potential to be radically transformed with the price of electricity — a mere fraction of jet fuel.

But sitting here in 2020, all-electric aviation holds little immediate promise for passenger aircraft with more than 19 seats on short-haul flights. The aircraft fuel, batteries in this case, needs to mature into the propulsion — not the other way around, as has been the case since the birth of aviation. Energy densities in batteries fall far short of what’s needed for mass air transport.

“Our experience with batteries shows us that battery technology is not moving at the pace we want and this is where hydrogen comes in,” said Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus vice president of zero emission aircraft. “We don’t believe that really it’s, today, a relevant technology for large commercial aircraft and we see hydrogen having much more potential.”

Read: Airbus makes a case for disruptive stability in the A321XLR

Embedded inside the strategic assumptions underpinning flying with hydrogen paint a very different future for aviation than the one to which the industry has become accustomed over the last 40 years. The realities of a carbon-free future powered by hydrogen means the enablers of growth — lower costs, higher frequencies, market liberalization — that allowed flying to scale globally will need to recede.

Airbus on Sept. 21 unveiled three conceptual aircraft designs, each relying on hydrogen fuel for their propulsion. Service entry of one of the three concepts is still 15 years away, but the company outlined a roadmap to commercial launch in 2027 or 2028. The company in April shelved its once-promising eFan X hybrid-electric demonstrator earlier this year as business collapsed with the onset of the pandemic, instead shifting its attention to carbon-less propulsion with hydrogen.

In July, The Economist mused about a what if scenario where aviation (and its industrial output) never returned to its pre-pandemic highs, permanently depressed by travel restrictions, environmental concerns, and no longer needed business travel.

The effect would be transformative as the aerospace and airline industries shifted into a greater reliance on governments to stay afloat and maintain employment. “That COVID-19 has exposed the fragility of globalization is particularly apparent in the case of aviation,” wrote the author, Charles Read. “The industry can no longer rely on the steady growth of the past, or indeed any growth at all.”

If that is indeed the case, then the peak of commercial aviation operations powered by traditional jet fuel may in fact be behind us. That comes with not only the near-term market realities of COVID-19, but the longer-term acknowledgment that a post-mature industry has fundamentally different needs than one in its ascent.

Bjorn’s Corner: The challenges of Hydrogen. Part 10. Airbus' Hydrogen ZEROe concepts - Leeham News and Analysis,"Fri, 25 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMC8wOS8yNS9iam9ybnMtY29ybmVyLXRoZS1jaGFsbGVuZ2VzLW9mLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLXBhcnQtMTAtYWlyYnVzLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLXplcm9lLWNvbmNlcHRzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"September 25, 2020, ©. Leeham News: In our series on Hydrogen as an energy store for airliners, we look at the three hydrogen-based concept aircraft Airbus presented this week.

They are called ZEROe and are concepts and not products, but their design tells us a lot about where Airbus is with its studies and how the hydrogen demonstrator aircraft might look like come 2026-2028.

How to understand Airbus’ Hydrogen concepts

Are the pictures of Airbus’ hydrogen-based ZEROe aircraft from Monday’s presentation also a hint of how future products will look like? Airbus EVP development Jean-Brice Dumont pointed out that concepts are not products.

The concepts are created to give Airbus and suppliers concrete example aircraft to work around when they look at configurations, aerodynamics, system solutions, and needed avionics to build efficient hydrogen-fueled airliners.

If we discard the Blended Wing-Body (BWB) variant, which I judge is there to spawn ideas and excitement more than show a realistic concept for the next move, the concepts still say a lot about what might come. Let’s look at what we can conclude from the Airbus presentation.

Hints for the 2027 demonstrator and 2035 first product

A demonstrator aircraft is scheduled for 2026-2028, but the program has a main supporter in the French government and the Paris Air Show is 2027. So let’s use June 2027 as the likely presentation date for a hydrogen-fueled demonstrator.

Will this be singular or plural? Airbus owns 50% of ATR and the turboprop concept looks very much like a more exciting ATR72, Figure 1.

At the same token, the Turbofan concept has several similarities with the Airbus A220, Figure 2. It would not be difficult to put the chain saw in the rear fuselages of former prototypes of an A220 and an ATR72, install the hydrogen tanks in modified rear tail cones as shown, and put the aircraft together again, now a bit shorter in the back (we come to why).

As we have seen, the challenge with hydrogen aircraft is the hydrogen tanks. The change of the rest of the fuel system components and the conversion of the Jet fuel-based engines to hydrogen is less of a challenge.

Airbus confirmed that all three concepts are hydrogen fueled gas turbine aircraft (also the BWB, I wasn’t sure directly after the presentation). It has come to the same conclusion as I, the step to a fuel cell-based hybrid with electric propulsion is risking a lot with no gains at the moment.

At the announcement Grazia Vittadini, the Airbus CTO said the gas turbine-based engines will have electric motors built-in. This is the electric starter generators I talked about in this Corner.

By moving the air starter and generators from the engine auxiliary gearbox to one of the shafts of the core, the acceleration of the engine can be faster and the core can be optimized with smaller margins to compressor stall. This leads to a more efficient engine compared with today’s engines with air starters and generators on the auxiliary gearbox.

I could talk to Vittadini in connection with the presentation and she confirmed that changing the APU to a hydrogen fuel cell that produces electrical energy is attractive, now that the main fuel is LH2. There was no confirmation or denying that this would find its way to the demonstrators or ultimately a product. We just have to wait and see.

Converting the APU of an A220 based demonstrator to hydrogen is straight forward, should the APU remain to reduce the risk budget. The ATR72 doesn’t have an APU so no problem there (but a hydrogen variant might, the concept turboprop has an APU).

How much do the concepts say about a 2035 Airbus product?

Probably a few things:

It will have hydrogen-fueled gas turbine Turbofan propulsion.

The likely seating will be at the heart of the single-aisle market. I would guess around 180 seats.

The general configuration of the aircraft will likely be like the Turbofan concept, with the tank in the rear of the aircraft. The heavy LH2 tank placed in the tail cone behind the cabin will move the wing back to balance the aircraft.

The wing can be made more slender as there is no volume requirement on the wing’s wingbox to house fuel. Many would say thinner but the profile of the wing and by it the thickness is dictated by super-critical transonic considerations and wing thickness is important for low wing weight. The wing cord (the width) will be shorter however to gain a high aspect ratio when paired with a large span. Folding wingtips might be used to get into the 36m gates of narrowbodies.

There will be Fly-By-Wire and aerodynamic adaptations to cater to the change in the Center of Gravity (CG) for the aircraft when the 1.5t hydrogen sitting behind the CG gets consumed during a typical 800nm to 1,000nm sector. We can view the large swept-back winglets as such an adaptation. We will probably see more innovations to cater to this CG shift.

These concepts have a hydrogen-based APU. Will the 2035 product? This will depend on the developments for the fuel cells. Will these be small, light, and reliable enough by 2035 to take over this role?

Materials for the LH2 tank and all fuel related components will be intensively researched and tested. A major task for the demonstrators will be to test materials under realistic operational conditions over a longer time.

Major aspects that are not shown in the concept pictures are the ground handling and airport infrastructure needed for hydrogen airliners. Once again, an important task for a demonstrator aircraft to test out.

As can be seen, we can deduce a number of hints from these concepts. We shall just avoid thinking these concepts define a 2035 product. Dumont said, one of the reasons is the market for a hydrogen airliner is not clear.

The demonstrator will be vital for airlines to understand all the aspects of operating a hydrogen airliner compared with today’s carbon-based types. When this becomes clearer, including the cost picture of hydrogen contra carbon-based airliners and state subsidies/taxes, products can be defined.

Will there be a hydrogen turboprop demonstrator and then a product from ATR? Probably. The French €15bn program announced in June contained program components for the regional industry, and in France this means ATR. We can expect a Turboprop demonstrator, based on a converted ATR72 and this can be followed by a product should the market reaction be positive.

Airbus Had to Redesign a Cockpit Control Panel Because Pilots Keep Spilling Their Coffee - Food & Wine,"Wed, 09 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2RhbmR3aW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1yZWRlc2lnbi1jb2NrcGl0LXBpbG90cy1zcGlsbC1jb2ZmZWXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What's the worst thing that could happen if you spill a cup of coffee at work? You soak several months' worth of calendar pages? You lose a handful of consonants on one side of your keyboard? Your chair smells like an abandoned Starbucks for the rest of the summer? Nothing really terrible will happen—well, not unless your workspace is in the cockpit of an Airbus A350.

According to World of Aviation, Airbus recently redesigned an entire control panel for its A350 aircraft because the previous configuration made it dangerously easy for pilots to knock their coffee cups over. In the past eight months, two A350-900s experienced single-engine shutdowns because of spilled drinks on the control panel—which is where the engine start switch and some electronic aircraft monitoring systems are located.

PASCAL PAVANI / Contributor/Getty Images

The problem is that pilots were using the previous control panel as ""a makeshift coffee table"" during flights, because they've found that the cup holders in the cockpit are too small. After those two high-profile incidents, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) banned all liquids from the center console, and Airbus updated its flight manuals to define that area as a liquid-free zone.

""Airbus, being a good European manufacturer, builds cup holders sized for French coffee rather than US sized coffee,"" one aviation website noted. But rather than, you know, make the cup holders bigger, Airbus has designed an entirely new control panel, one which is resistant to liquid spills.

Simple Flying reports that the first high-profile spill took place last fall on what was believed to be an Asiana Air flight when someone knocked their tea over. (The carrier has not been confirmed, but an A350 flying from Seoul to Singapore made an emergency landing in Manila on the same day that a spill-related incident was reported.) Several months later, a Delta flight from Detroit to Seoul had to be diverted to Fairbanks, Alaska just 15 minutes after a drink was spilled in the cockpit.

Last September, a Condor Airlines flight from Frankfurt, Germany to Cancun had to be diverted to Shannon, Ireland after a pilot knocked his coffee cup over in the cockpit of an A330 aircraft. The cabin filled with smoke and a not-at-all unsettling smell of burning electrical components, but there were no injuries reported among the 11 crew members or 326 passengers. ""We have comprehensively investigated this incident and reviewed the procedures of liquids in the cockpit,"" a spokesperson for the airline said at the time. ""Our crews were reminded of [the need for] careful handling as well as to use appropriate containers for their water or coffee.""

If EASA gives its approval, the new spill-proof panels will be installed in A350-900s and A350-1000s within the next eight months. Maybe handing out a few Euro-sized travel mugs—with lids—would help too.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7965484857559204}",neutral,0.7965484857559204,0
Airbus charts path to zero emission aviation by 2035 - pv magazine International,"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB2LW1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS8yMDIwLzA5LzIxL2FpcmJ1cy1jaGFydHMtcGF0aC10by16ZXJvLWVtaXNzaW9uLWF2aWF0aW9uLWJ5LTIwMzUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The planemaker was circumspect when it came to estimating the cost of its hydrogen flight effort.

With pressure mounting on the airline industry to play its part in combating greenhouse gas emissions, European manufacturer Airbus today announced plans for three emissions-free aircraft. The Toulouse-based planemaker said the models could enter commercial service by 2035.

“This is a historic moment for the commercial aviation sector as a whole and we intend to play a leading role in the most important transition this industry has ever seen,” said Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury. “The concepts we unveil today offer the world a glimpse of our ambition to drive a bold vision for the future of zero-emission flight. I strongly believe that the use of hydrogen – both in synthetic fuels and as a primary power source for commercial aircraft – has the potential to significantly reduce aviation's climate impact.”

Best of three

The first of the three concept aircraft revealed features a turbofan design and could transport 120-200 passengers and travel more than 3,700km, the manufacturer claimed. The engines would be modified gas-turbines that could run on hydrogen rather than conventional jet fuel. The hydrogen would release its stored energy through combustion, rather than reacting in a fuel cell.

The aircraft, which appears similar to ordinary commercial planes, would also feature an embedded electric motor powered by hydrogen fuel cells, for use when extra power is necessary, according to the company presentation.

A second, fairly ordinary looking airplane concept revealed by Airbus has a turboprop design which would feature propeller-based propulsion instead of jet engines. That model could host up to 100 passengers and would also use hydrogen combustion in modified gas turbines to generate energy, with embedded electric motors similar to the design above. The concept could travel almost 2,000km and would be used for short-haul flights, according to Airbus.

The third model revealed featured a blended-wing design, could carry 200 passengers and would have a range of almost 4,000km, as a relatively large fuselage would accommodate passengers and hydrogen. Here too, the Airbus anticipates using a combination of hydrogen combustion and fuel cell reaction to optimize the power supply.

Grazia Vittadini, chief technology officer at Airbus, said hydrogen has the same energy level as kerosene but just a third of the weight. The “catch,” is the fact hydrogen occupies four times the volume of the conventional fuel, rendering its use in long-haul flights challenging.

Airbus said the hydrogen would be cooled to -253 degrees Celsius, at which point it would become liquid and increase volumetric density. For additional onboard storage capacity, some fuselage space could be devoted to the fuel, rather than passengers. That switch, however, would necessitate a reconfiguration of fuselage length and diameter, with a negative impact on aerodynamic drag. Optimizing that change would be among the challenges facing Airbus over the next 15 years, the company stated.

Popular content

Next year, Airbus expects to launch a hydrogen ground demonstrator, which could take-off in demonstration flights in 2023. Safety verification and validation processes, and the development of hydrogen infrastructure on the plane and at airports, would be a long process. Add in certification with permission to use the designs for commercial aviation and the 15-year timeline begins to appear ambitious.

Why hydrogen?

“Battery technology is not moving at the pace we want,” said Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus VP and head of zero-emission aircraft at today's press conference. “And this is where hydrogen comes in. It's got several thousand times more energy per kilogram than batteries could have today.” Llewellyn added, Airbus has started work with airlines, airports and energy companies because the endeavor will require enormous joint efforts.

Before hydrogen-powered aircraft can take to the sky, Airbus noted, airports will require significant hydrogen transportation and refueling infrastructure investments. The EU-based manufacturer said governments should support its objectives by providing funding for research and technology, plus digitalization to manage the projects necessary.

States should also incentivize airlines to switch legacy aircraft to hydrogen-powered models, said Airbus.

Quizzed about strategic partners, CTO Vittadini said: “For sure, the challenge of decarbonizing aviation is such that by no means [is it] something we intend to do on our own. So indeed, we are going to be reinforcing partnerships across the sector, across the industry, considering, of course, research institutes, our customers. We have, of course, already several projects going.”

The three Airbus executives present at today's event were less forthcoming on just how much their hydrogen flight effort would cost, with Llewellyn stating only that the initiative would require “billions.” One of the spin-off benefits that could be anticipated, said the airplane manufacturer, would be a reduction in hydrogen costs beyond the aviation industry.

Consultant McKinsey published an EU-commissioned report in June which estimated hydrogen-powered flight would only add around 10% to short-haul flight ticket costs – around $5-10 – and could be viable in 8-15 years, pending technology breakthroughs, certification and standards and infrastructure. Medium-range hydrogen flights would require a 30-40% rise in ticket prices, saidMcKinsey, as the larger fuselages required to store liquid hydrogen would lead to 25% more in-flight energy consumption. And long-haul passengers would have to pay 40-50% more for hydrogen tech, meaning synthetic fuel, or'synfuel', may offer a more effective path towards decarbonization for that segment of the industry.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9992015957832336}",neutral,0.9992015957832336,0
Airbus offers look inside new A220 assembly line - AL.com,"Mon, 14 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsLmNvbS9uZXdzL21vYmlsZS8yMDIwLzA5L2FpcmJ1cy1vZmZlcnMtbG9vay1pbnNpZGUtbmV3LWEyMjAtYXNzZW1ibHktbGluZS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Celebrating five years of building aircraft in Mobile, Airbus has provided a first look inside its new assembly line for A220 jetliners.

Commercial aircraft production began in Mobile on Sept. 14, 2015. (The first made-in-Alabama A321, named “BluesMobile,” was delivered to JetBlue amid great fanfare on April 25, 2016.)

Five years later, Airbus USA has much to celebrate. It pegs its five-year economic impact on Mobile and Baldwin counties at $1.1 billion, not to mention 12,000 jobs “through construction and payroll alone.” It has delivered more than 180 A320-family jetliners to eight customers and undergone a huge expansion to manufacture the A220.

Among other things, that involved adding 70 acres to its existing 116-acre footprint and going from 736,000 square feet of facilities to 1.26 million. That includes the new Final Assembly Line, new hangars and an expansion to the Delivery Center so that it can accommodate more deliveries. That building is being named for Tom Enders, the former CEO who pushed for Airbus to build jets in Mobile.

But the company also is weathering a global near-shutdown of commercial air travel caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Leading into 2020, manufacturers such as Airbus and Boeing had been steadily pushing production levels upward to meet seemingly insatiable demand. But the lack of travel has made airlines reluctant to take delivery of new jets, which has led manufacturers to drastically slow production, which has sent shock waves through their complicated international supply chains. Industry experts have predicted it’ll take several years to return to normal, but many have also questioned whether 2019, the peak of a long boom, should really be considered normal.

Airbus executives in Mobile assessed their situation with a mix of pride, optimism and realism. On Friday Daryl Taylor, vice president and general manager of the Mobile facility, said that “while COVID has had an impact, I can tell you it has not had an impact on our ability to be ready to get our employees in position to get the aircraft built and to deliver on our commitments.”

Taylor said that 2019 had been “a period of extreme and fast workforce growth. Faster than we’ve ever experienced.” The local workforce had grown to about 1,000, 90% of whom reside in Mobile or Baldwin.

“Today we’ve had no impact to our permanent workforce” due to COVID, Taylor said. Elaborating on that, he said some contract work had been eliminated but there’d been no furloughs or layoffs for full-time, permanent employees.

“We’re also confident we build the right products in Mobile,” he said.

Industry experts have suggested that demand will be strongest for narrowbody aircraft, particularly long-range versions such as the A321LR and A321XLR as the industry recovers over the next few years. The thought is that they’ll provide a more efficient way of handling reduced volumes of travelers. If that holds true, the Mobile facility’s portfolio of A320s and A220s would seem to put it in a good position.

“We know that after decades of growth, 2020 will be the first real significant step-down in aerospace,” Taylor said. The effect clearly will be more long-lasting than those of the 2002-04 SARS epidemic or the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, he said.

“Our view, and I think the industry’s overall view, is it could be as late as 2024 or 2025, assuming vaccines and everything are in place in the next short period of time, before the industry recovers,” he said. “Why we think the single-aisle is on the front end of that is because international travel is certainly is the hardest hit.” Domestic travel also is likely to rebound sooner, he said.

“The 220 and 320 in Mobile, we have the right products,” Taylor said. “Even in a bad time, these are the products to be building.”

The flow line where A220s are assembled looks much like the line for A320s: Inside a cavernous hall, jetliners are lined up nose to tail. Each advances in turn through a series of stations where various stages of the assembly process are completed.

One difference is that where the A320 moves through four stations, an A220 moves through five. It may seem odd that the smaller, newer product has a more complicated path, but Paul Gaskell, president of the A220 program in Mobile, said that it comes down to “the maturity of the product.”

Airbus has been building A320-family jets since the late ’80s, Gaskell said, and the Final Assembly Line in Mobile is the fourth for the program. Over the decades, the company has found ways to consolidate the process and make it more efficient. The A220 is much newer, so that hasn’t happened yet.

“We have a lot more work content on the 220 than we actually do on the 320, and that’s why we need five stations instead of four,” he said. But he predicted that as lessons are learned, eventually the A220 assembly process will more closely resemble that of the A320.

Airbus still expects to deliver the first U.S.-built A220 this year, but a date for that delivery has not yet been set.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997217059135437}",neutral,0.9997217059135437,0
First A350 cabin to cargo conversion with Airbus Service Bulletin completed with Asiana Airlines - Airbus Aircraft,"Wed, 30 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vYWlyY3JhZnQuYWlyYnVzLmNvbS9lbi9maXJzdC1hMzUwLWNhYmluLXRvLWNhcmdvLWNvbnZlcnNpb24td2l0aC1haXJidXMtc2VydmljZS1idWxsZXRpbi1jb21wbGV0ZWQtd2l0aC1hc2lhbmEtYWlybGluZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"30 September, 2020

South Korea’s Asiana Airlines has become the world’s first airline to embody the Airbus solution to convert an A350 passenger cabin to carry freight. This solution, packaged as an Airbus Service Bulletin (SB) no. SB 25-P170, was developed in close cooperation between Airbus, European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and Asiana.

The modified A350 was put into service in the last week of September flying the Seoul-Los Angeles route, transporting IT and electronic equipment, as well as e-commerce exports such as clothing.

From October, the aircraft will service additional high-demand routes including Seoul-Ho Chi Minh. The project required the replacement of 283 economy seats with cargo pallets on the cabin floor to firmly secure cargo loads. The two-week modification increases the aircraft’s cargo capacity by five additional metric tonnes to 23 tonnes. Amidst the global impact of COVID-19 on the aviation industry, Asiana is pursuing an active response towards utilising the cargo carrying capabilities of its passenger airliner fleet to expand its cargo capacity.

We took the decision for aircraft modification after a close review of its capability to secure safety and increase profitability. Cargo sales have become a big part of the airline’s business during the COVID-19 situation, and we will carry out various efforts for the segment

Kim Kwang-seok, Senior Executive Vice President of Cargo Business at Asiana

Since the onset of COVID-19 earlier in the year, EASA issued exemption guidelines to airlines for the transportation of medical and urgent cargo. Airbus then worked with EASA to develop a SB for the modification of passenger aircraft, which Asiana adopted. Once the SB was granted, the Airbus field service team in South Korea helped to facilitate discussions between the Airbus’ Flight Ops Support team in Singapore, together with its Flight Ops Support and Engineering Support teams based in Toulouse.

Compared with loading cargo onto seats, the Airbus SB solution – announced in April this year – facilitates easier and quicker loading and unloading operations, as well as reduced ‘wear & tear’ to the seats themselves. Other important benefits for airlines include the added security of robust fire protection, and the 9g load restraint capability to prevent anything from shifting in flight. Its scope includes the removal of the seats & IFE (Inflight entertainment), installation of cargo pallets and associated safety equipment – and also the re-installation of the original passenger cabin elements for reverting back to passenger operations. The SB approach will also be valid beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.

We congratulate Asiana Airlines on becoming the first operator to convert an A350 using Airbus’ solution. During these challenging times we are heartened to see our airline partners move nimbly to address their needs. Airbus remains committed to support our airline partners by providing solutions to their new needs

Airbus CEO Tom Enders said in an official statement :

We have no substantial A380 backlog and hence no basis to sustain production, despite all our sales efforts with other airlines in recent years.

Following a review of its operations and in light of developments in aircraft and engines, @Emirates agrees with Airbus to

➡ reduce its A380 order book by 39 aircraft

➡ order 40 #A330neo & 30 #A350

As a result, A380 deliveries will cease in 2021

Release: https://t.co/hCyvPElB1O pic.twitter.com/S8t2KI3Ge4 — Airbus Newsroom (@AirbusPRESS) February 14, 2019

The statement comes as Airbus’ biggest customer, Dubai-based airline Emirates slashed its order for the 500-plus-seat passenger plane, leaving Airbus with no other choice than to pull the plug on the A380 program. A decision the planemaker says could substantially affect 3,500 jobs within the company. By far its biggest client, the Emirates owns 96 A380 and has another 46 on its way.

Emirates Chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum also commented on his company’s decision to cancel further orders, while focusing on the fuel-efficient A330 and the A350s in a company statement :

While we are disappointed to have to give up our order, and sad that the program could not be sustained, we accept that this is the reality of the situation. The A380 will remain a pillar of our fleet well into the 2030s.

We are pleased to announce an order with @Airbus for 40 A330-900neo and 30 A350-900 aircraft, worth US$ 21.4 billion at list prices.

Unloved Superjumbo

Airbus’ Global Market Forecast had estimated that the company would deliver 1,235 superjumbos to airlines within 19 years. However, as at January 2019, Airbus had received a mere 313 orders for the A380 and delivered 234 aircraft .

The A380 program was launched in 1994, as a direct response to Boeing’s 747, designed to carry large passengers to big airports before splitting them into smaller planes on their way to their final destination. The plane’s large number of seats was seen as instrumental in helping free up traffic in congested airports like London’s Heathrow and New York’s JFK. The orders poured in, Airbus went into production, and the first plane took to the skies.

Fourteen years ago, the first A380 took to the skies carrying customers from Singapore to Sydney flown by Singapore Airlines. Not long after, British Airways, Emirates, Air China carriers littered the skies.

The double-decker giant plane, which is priced publicly at $445 million but comes with steep discounts worked well for both airlines and their customers. Customers were enchanted with the walk-up bars, and the additional space, airlines charged a premium on tickets for routes using the A380.

Fuel-efficient Alternatives

The success of the A380 was quickly undermined by the arrival of lighter and fuel efficient planes such as Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner and Airbus’ A350.

Widely seen as the aircraft Airbus did not want to build , the A350 was an instant hit with airlines. The A350 was a response to Boeing’s 787, and it came with some features in the A330 model along with lighter fuselage made from carbon fiber reinforced plastic and new engines from Rolls Royce to enhance its fuel efficiency capacity.

For passengers, the A350 planes have cabin pressure equal to around 1800 meters above sea level and 600 meters lower than what you’d get on an average aircraft, providing your lungs with more oxygen, moisture, and comfort on that long haul flight. There are currently 240 Airbus A350s flying in the skies operated by popular carriers like Qatar Airways, British Airways, Delta Air Lines, China Airlines and others.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999148845672607}",neutral,0.9999148845672607,0
Airbus reveals three hydrogen fueled concept aircraft - Aerospace Testing International,"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm9zcGFjZXRlc3RpbmdpbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLmNvbS9uZXdzL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvYWlyYnVzLXJldmVhbHMtdGhyZWUtaHlkcm9nZW4tZnVlbGVkLWNvbmNlcHQtYWlyY3JhZnQuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has revealed three zero-emission hydrogen fueled commercial aircraft concepts that it claims could enter service by 2035.

The three concepts – all codenamed “ZEROe”, and all fueled by hydrogen -include a turbofan design, a turboprop concept and a blended-wing body.

“The concepts we unveil today offer the world a glimpse of our ambition to drive a bold vision for the future of zero-emission flight,” said Guillaume Faury, Airbus CEO. “I strongly believe that the use of hydrogen – both in synthetic fuels and as a primary power source for commercial aircraft – has the potential to significantly reduce aviation’s climate impact.”

In a statement detailing the proposed aircraft, Airbus explained that the turbofan concept (a 120 – 200 passenger airliner) will have a range of 2,000+ nautical miles and will be powered by a modified gas-turbine engine running on hydrogen, rather than jet fuel, through combustion. The liquid hydrogen will be stored and distributed via tanks located behind the rear pressure bulkhead.

A separate turboprop design (up to 100 passengers) will also be powered by hydrogen combustion in modified gas-turbine engines. This would be capable of traveling more than 1,000 nautical miles, said the firm.

The third concept is for a “blended-wing body” design (up to 200 passengers) in which the wings merge with the main body of the aircraft with a range similar to that of the turbofan concept. The exceptionally wide fuselage opens up multiple options for hydrogen storage and distribution, and for cabin layout.

“These concepts will help us explore and mature the design and layout of the world’s first climate-neutral, zero-emission commercial aircraft, which we aim to put into service by 2035,” said Faury. “The transition to hydrogen, as the primary power source for these concept planes, will require decisive action from the entire aviation ecosystem. Together with the support from government and industrial partners we can rise up to this challenge to scale-up renewable energy and hydrogen for the sustainable future of the aviation industry.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9501401782035828}",neutral,0.9501401782035828,0

Airbus hopes it can encourage a tectonic industry shift toward new types of fuel that reduce emissions. It plans to put these planes in the skies by 2035, which is, um, not that far away.

There’s a jet-like mode that’s capable of carrying up to 200 passengers as far as 2,000 nautical miles (2,300 miles). This one is powered by Turbofans that combust hydrogen stored in the rear pressure bulkhead. Airbus says this would be the choice of craft for transcontinental travel.

There’s also a propeller driven model, which is powered by Turboprops, this model should be able to carry up to 100 passengers, and will supposedly be capable of travelling 1,000 nautical miles (1,150 miles). In other words, this is the preferred choice for short-haul trips.

The most futuristic, out-there design is what Airbus calls a “blended-wing design.” It will use a similar propulsion method as the Turbofan design, but is far more striking in its appearance. It’s got an essence of the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk about it, in that it’s hard to say where the wings stop and the fuselage begins.

According to an Airbus engineer cited by Bloomberg, the blended-wing design will be the most challenging to produce and develop.

“The concepts we unveil today offer the world a glimpse of our ambition to drive a bold vision for the future of zero-emission flight,” said Guillaume Faury, Airbus CEO. “I strongly believe that the use of hydrogen — both in synthetic fuels and as a primary power source for commercial aircraft — has the potential to significantly reduce aviation’s climate impact.”

At the unveiling, Glenn Llewellyn, head of zero emissions aircraft at Airbus, was critical of battery technology, saying that it wasn’t developing at the rate the aerospace industry needs.

“The challenge when we really go to larger commercial aircraft like applications we see the need for hydrogen, there is far more times energy needed. Batteries are just not improving at the rate we need,” he said.

“To meet the climate change agreement there needs to be impressive implementation of renewable energy and hydrogen,” Llewellyn added.

Realistically though, hydrogen has a number of benefits over battery electric power, in that refueling a plane can take minutes not hours, and when the fuel is used you’re not carrying dead weight in the form of batteries.

Airbus’ dreams of the future are all well and good, but the whole success of these aircraft and whether they can operate at all depends on the industry embracing the concept and providing hydrogen infrastructure.

“Developing a hydrogen aircraft on that timeline will be a real challenge because of the massive amounts of infrastructure and government investment required,” Bloomberg’s Charlotte Ryan writes.

Airbus has reportedly already started talking with airports, other airlines, and energy providers. The company is also calling on governments to offer incentives that will encourage an industry-wide shift to hydrogen power, these could include financial kickbacks for retiring old planes and investing in new h-powered versions.

This might not be as challenging as it sounds, Airbus has close ties to German and French government as those two countries are the company’s largest shareholders and have put some $2.9 billion towards development of clean propulsion systems.

“The transition to hydrogen, as the primary power source for these concept planes, will require decisive action from the entire aviation ecosystem,” said Faury.

It seems two of the main players in the industry — aircraft makers and governments — have their priorities aligned. Now we just need the airports to get on board.

The European aerospace behemoth released initial plans for three airplanes that, although appearing quite similar to aircraft currently cruising among the clouds, all operate in a much more environmentally conscious way. Airbus believes that the technology could be viable and in use by 2035 with the potential to cut aircraft emissions by half. That’s a critical figure as commercial planes generated 918 million metric tons of CO2 in 2018, 2.4 percent of the total generated globally by fossil fuels, according to the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT). And the United Nations aviation department predicts that number will triple by 2050 if left unchecked.

“As recently as five years ago, hydrogen propulsion wasn’t even on our radar as a viable emission-reduction technology pathway,” said Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus VP, Zero-Emission Aircraft, in a press statement. “But convincing data from other transport industries quickly changed all that. Today, we’re excited by the incredible potential hydrogen offers aviation in terms of disruptive emissions reduction.”

This development comes on the heels of Airbus announcing its goal to develop the world’s first zero-emission commercial aircraft. The company chose hydrogen specifically because it stands apart from many other clean-fuel alternatives, not only because of its viability with land-based vehicles but because of its ability to reduce overall emissions so drastically right from the start. When it comes to aircraft, there are generally two types of hydrogen fuel systems: hydrogen combustion and hydrogen fuel cells. The three nascent plane concepts take a hybrid approach that uses modified gas-turbine engines to burn liquid hydrogen as fuel, while hydrogen fuel cells would create electrical power.

“Hydrogen has a different volumetric energy density than jet fuel so we have to study other storage options and aircraft architectures than existing ones,” said Jean-Brice Dumont, and Airbus engineering executive, said in a press release. “This means the visual appearance of our future zero-emission aircraft will change. These three configurations provide us with some exciting options for further exploration.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9993496537208557}",neutral,0.9993496537208557,0
The hydrogen-powered aircraft takes shape - DW (English),"Fri, 25 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR3LmNvbS9lbi9hdC1haXJidXMtYS1oeWRyb2dlbi1wb3dlcmVkLWFpcmNyYWZ0LXRha2VzLXNoYXBlL2EtNTUwNTE1NznSAVJodHRwczovL2FtcC5kdy5jb20vZW4vYXQtYWlyYnVzLWEtaHlkcm9nZW4tcG93ZXJlZC1haXJjcmFmdC10YWtlcy1zaGFwZS9hLTU1MDUxNTc5?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus wants to launch a plane that is completely CO2 neutral by 2035 with the help of hydrogen-powered engines. It's a big step away from fossil fuels and toward a cleaner future up in the sky.

It doesn't exactly look like an aviation revolution. Airbus's newest aircraft design study glides through cloudless skies accompanied by celestial music — in an animated video. On a closer look it becomes evident though that the back of the fuselage doesn't have any windows at all (see photo below). On top of the vertical stabilizer there is something sticking out that looks a bit like an antenna.

These characteristics show that this indeed might be a breakthrough. ""In the aft part of the aircraft, behind the pressure bulkhead of the cabin, the hydrogen tank is located, and the nozzle on top of the stabilizer serves to let off gas in the case of a leak,"" explained Airbus Chief Technology Officer Grazia Vittadini at a recent presentation of the company's first studies on hydrogen-powered airliners.

The aim is ambitious: By 2035 Airbus wants to bring the world's first emission-free passenger aircraft to market.

Moving away from fossil fuels

For this, the European manufacturer came up with three competing concepts, one of which shall become reality. Under strong pressure from politicians mostly in France and Germany, Airbus wants to be at the forefront of the transformation, accelerating aviation's move away from fossil fuels and fostering decarbonization.

Germany has already developed its own hydrogen strategy. France pledged in early September to invest €7 billion ($8.1 billion) in hydrogen technology. So Airbus's venture comes at exactly the right time.

""This is an historic moment for the commercial aviation sector as a whole,"" said Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury about this ""bold vision."" Vittadini stressed ""these exciting concepts are also intended to inspire future generations of engineers.""

Hydrogen is difficult to handle

The idea to use hydrogen instead of kerosene as the energy source for aircraft engines isn't exactly new, but it is still challenging to turn into reality. That's why until today there is a lack of aircraft concepts that are up to harsh day-to-day use as well as economical operations.

Aircraft manufacturing in crisis To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video

Hydrogen is not easy to care for. Compared to kerosene, it has three times the energy density, which is a big advantage over batteries, and only weighs a third as much. But planes need up to four times the volume to keep them in the air. And space is notoriously scarce and thus precious on any aircraft.

On top of that — and this makes things very demanding — hydrogen is a so-called cryogenic fuel: A gas that only liquefies at minus 253 degrees Celsius (minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit). And even then, it can only be used for propulsion if compressed under high pressure. This necessitates a double-walled, cylindrical or spherical tank.

Back in 1988, engineers in what was then the Soviet Union modified a three-engine Tupolev Tu-154 airliner in a way that the right engine was powered by hydrogen. They called the test bed Tu-155.

Revolutionary but conventional

Hydrogen can be used on aircraft in different ways: For direct combustion in modified gas turbines, converted to electrical energy via fuel cells or as synthetic kerosene, produced in combining it with CO2.

""We have to redesign the aircraft around this concept,"" said Vittadini. In doing this Airbus proposes a trio of different concepts.

The first concept is the conventional looking turbofan design described at the beginning of this article. It is able to carry 120 to 200 passengers on routes of up to 3,700 kilometers (2,300 miles), meaning it is neither capable of doing long-haul flights nor transcontinental flights.

The concept aircraft is slightly smaller than the current base model A320neo, operated by Lufthansa among others, but achieves the same speed of over 800 kilometers per hour also operating on hydrogen.

The second concept is a turboprop aircraft with propellers, taking up to a hundred passengers on short-haul routes and achieving 600 kilometers per hour, making it about a hundred kilometers per hour faster than current turboprops. Both designs feature modified gas turbines for propulsion, complemented by a hybrid electrical motor run by fuel cells.

It is all kept fairly conventional on purpose, ""so we don't have to invest in completely new technologies,"" explained Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury.

Going for the Flying V

But there is also a third, disruptive concept: the hydrogen-powered Blended Wing Body design. Its wings and fuselage form one continuous aerodynamic body. This design is deemed the preferred one for future aircraft, such as the Flying V study recently unveiled in the Netherlands by airline KLM and the Delft University of Technology.

""The blended wing is aerodynamically the most advantageous model to integrate hydrogen tanks,"" Vittadini told DW. ""But that doesn't mean that it is the ultimate solution for all other parameters.""

Airbus's initiative is also getting support from the science world. ""The world is ready for it and Airbus has seized the opportunity,"" Dragan Kozulovic, professor for flight propulsion at the Hamburg University for Applied Sciences, told DW.

He finds it remarkable that the designs make do completely without using kerosene. He also thinks the planned entry into service by 2035 is realistic. Kozulovic sees the turboprop design as the most probable winning concept. But then, he stresses, it is crucial for its success that the necessary infrastructure for hydrogen operations on the ground is put into place, from production to storage and tanking. ""That is a mammoth task,"" he said.

Hydrogen is only sustainable if produced from ""green"" energy, for example solar or wind power. Still Kozulovic objects to Airbus billing its concepts, called ZEROe, as being entirely ""emission free.""

Even if no CO2 is emitted, combusting hydrogen still produces water vapor, causing contrails in the skies that have a climate impact, as well as nitric oxide. ""These aircraft will be significantly better, but not emission free,"" he explained.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9303064942359924}",neutral,0.9303064942359924,0
"Aviation, an irreplaceable force for good - Airbus","Fri, 25 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIwLTA5LWF2aWF0aW9uLWFuLWlycmVwbGFjZWFibGUtZm9yY2UtZm9yLWdvb2TSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aviation, an irreplaceable force for good in the world, is today at risk as borders remain closed and influential voices in Europe call for permanent curbs on flying. Guillaume Faury, Airbus Chief Executive Officer, shares his view on why it is important to act now.

Aviation’s precious role in society is at risk, as borders remain closed and influential voices in Europe call for permanent curbs on flying.

The commercial aviation industry supports a total of more than 80 million jobs worldwide encompassing the tourism sector, the industry’s supply chain, airlines, airports and many more. Closing borders and cancelling flights mean families are dispersed across the world and unable to meet face-to-face, demonstrating how aviation has become fundamental to many people’s way of life.

Aviation connects and unites people, cultures and businesses. Providing the lifeline of international trade, aviation supports development, education and global economies. Airtravel does not only broaden our intellectual horizons, it eases tensions by bringing us together to learn from and understand each other, helping us find answers to our shared problems. Aviation safeguards global peace and stability. It underpins the multilateralism, diplomacy and conflict resolution that many have taken for granted in the latter part of the 20th century. Clearly then, a more connected world is a more prosperous world, a prosperity that provides the foundation for innovation at scale and lasting transformation.

The longer the hiatus on international trade and movement, the more serious the consequences will be. A prolonged economic malaise will leave governments and businesses on a weaker footing to address the most pressing issues. Major changes are needed on a global scale if we are to tackle the biggest challenge of our time: climate change. In order to rise to this challenge, a rapid transformation of everything from the power and transport sectors to heavy industry and construction is needed. This in turn depends on the urgent deployment of vast amounts of capital. Yet this crisis is constraining business investment and, amid closed borders, the world has become a more unstable place in 2020 due to growing nationalism, geo-political conflict and protectionism.

All this is at stake during this pandemic. All this explains why the safe, swift revival of air travel can help heal the wounds of this crisis.

Yet aviation’s value to society is currently in question, as public concern about the environment mounts. So addressing this concern is now a priority.

Each sector must take its part and we are committed to taking ours. While emissions from aviation only account for 2-3% of all man-made CO2 emissions, we want to be at the forefront of this major transformation. At Airbus, our ambition is to lead the decarbonisation of our sector and build the world’s first emissions-free airliner by 2035. We are committed to this ambition as demonstrated by our new emission-free aircraft concept designs. We believe we can pioneer the industry, with key partners, to make carbon-free commercial flight a reality. The 2020s hold the promise of far-reaching progress towards zero-carbon aviation and governments are providing new impetus as they commit research funding to sustainable aviation.

That’s why the debate in Europe and across the globe needs urgent re-framing. The aviation industry is entering a period of innovation to match anything since the dawn of air travel. Aviation leaves little physical imprint on the ecosystem - landscapes, flora, fauna and natural river courses remain untouched as aircraft fly over them. And what about other transport sectors? For example, expectations of what rail can achieve by itself outreach the current reality. Europe’s high-speed network remains fragmented. By contrast, aviation offers passengers an unparalleled breadth of connections - 8,600 direct routes between cities in Europe alone - and greater range: the average distance of each flight in Europe is over 1,700 km, more than five times the length of most rail journeys. Aviation brings these advantages while protecting the Earth and its ecosystem by flying over it - this gives us an opportunity to be even more visionary from an ecological standpoint.

These are difficult, febrile times for us all. My message for policymakers is clear: aviation is an irreplaceable force for good in the world. It must remain so in the post-pandemic world.

Airbus Marks Five Years in Mobile - Business Alabama,"Mon, 14 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3NhbGFiYW1hLmNvbS9haXJidXMtbWFya3MtZml2ZS15ZWFycy1pbi1tb2JpbGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Five years to the day after Airbus began work on its first A321 aircraft in Mobile, the firm today is celebrating its growth and its impact on the Mobile community.

That first aircraft was delivered to JetBlue Airways, and since then the firm has delivered 186 A320-family planes to eight airlines. Those planes have carried some 60 million passengers for some 500 million miles.

In the meantime, Airbus has added a second final assembly line in Mobile to make the smaller A220 jets.

U.S. production has allowed Airbus to increase its market share here from 40%, before it started U.S. production, to 70%, said Daryl Taylor, vice president and general manager of the Mobile facility.

Total employment has grown from 250 in 2015 to 1,000 today, and total facilities investment has topped $1 billion, company officials say, with another $24 million spent on training. The firm has created a facts-and-figures flipbook, which is available here.

“When we announced our intent to build A320 family aircraft in the United States and to locate that facility in Mobile, Alabama, we also stated our intent to be a good neighbor, to create jobs and opportunities and to help strengthen the U.S. aerospace industry. Five years later, we have become a major economic driver in creating an aerospace hub on the Gulf Coast,” said C. Jeffrey Knittel, president and CEO of Airbus Americas Inc.

The University of South Alabama’s Center for Real Estate & Economic Development calculates the firm’s impact in Mobile and Baldwin counties at $1.1 billion supporting 12,000 jobs, with an impact of $1.2 billion and 15,000 jobs in the entire state.

In addition, the firm identifies more than 40 charitable and civic causes that it has supported since opening here.

Just before the coronavirus-caused drop in air travel, Airbus Mobile was poised to turn out seven of the bigger A320-family planes and four of the A220 planes each month. That production rate has slowed drastically, but work continues and employment has held steady at 1,000.

The firm has also opened a second delivery facility, where airlines come to pick up their new planes. The facility is named for Tom Enders, who long urged the European firm to build planes in Mobile. A new hangar is also under construction on site.

Airbus has had a presence in Mobile since 2005, when it opened a C212 and CN235 support unit at Mobile Regional Airport. The Airbus engineering center, which now supports most commercial aircraft products, opened in 2007. The Final Assembly Line, the first such Airbus facility in the U.S., opened in 2015.

In 2019, Airbus outsold its U.S.-based rival Boeing for the first time in the commercial aircraft market.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5305383801460266}",neutral,0.5305383801460266,0
Airbus signs $350 million contract to build CRISTAL ice-monitoring satellite for EU - SpaceNews,"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXJidXMtc2lnbnMtMzUwLW1pbGxpb24tY29udHJhY3QtdG8tYnVpbGQtY3Jpc3RhbC1pY2UtbW9uaXRvcmluZy1zYXRlbGxpdGUtZm9yLWV1L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"VALLETTA, Malta — The European Space Agency signed a 300-million-euro ($352 million) contract with Airbus Defence and Space on Sept. 21 to develop an ice-monitoring satellite for European Union’s Earth-observing Copernicus program.

The Copernicus Polar Ice and Snow Topography Altimeter mission, or CRISTAL, is one of two Earth-observing missions Airbus was awarded this summer as Europe expands the network of Sentinel satellites it began launching in 2014 to keep closer tabs on the environment.

Thales Alenia Space, which was chosen as prime contractor for three of the six new-generation Copernicus missions awarded in July, will build CRISTAL’s main instrument under an 88-million-euro subcontract to Airbus signed this week.

With a planned launch in 2027, the European Union intends to use CRISTAL to monitor the cryosphere, which includes all areas of the Earth’s surface where water is found in solid form. Specifically, the satellite will gauge the thickness of sea ice and the snow that covers it, both of which are key indicators to predicting climate change.

“It will be critical in monitoring climate indicators, including the variability of Arctic sea ice, and ice sheet and ice cap melting,” said Josef Aschbacher, the European Space Agency’s director of Earth observation programs. ESA will oversee the development, launch and operation of the mission on behalf of the European Commission-led Copernicus program.

Airbus said the 1.7-ton CRISTAL satellite it has been tasked to develop will feature six fixed and two deployable solar arrays, and onboard storage for up to 4 terabits of science data the satellite will collect over its planned 7.5-year lifetime.

Airbus said the spacecraft will build on a satellite design it used for the Sentinel-6 ocean topography satellite launching in November and CryoSat-2, a CRISTAL forerunner mission that launched in 2010 and remains in service.

Thales Alenia Space will be responsible for developing CRISTSAL’s primary payload, the Interferometric Radar Altimeter for Ice and Snow (IRIS) instrument. The Franco-Italian spacecraft manufacturer signed an 88-million-euro contract with Airbus on Sept. 21 to develop two flight-ready IRIS instruments for the mission.

The IRIS instruments are dual-frequency Ku-/Ka-band radar altimeters that will be used to measure the thickness of sea ice and the snow that covers it. The instruments will also measure and monitor the height of the world’s ice sheets and glaciers. Thales Alenia Space said the instruments’ dual-frequency operation will help it make more accurate measurements than earlier ice-monitoring altimeters.

Once CRISTAL is complete, it is expected to be launched into a polar orbit approximately 760 kilometers above the Earth.

According to Copernicus program manager Guido Levrini, the spacecraft will be designed to be compatible with two different launch vehicles, one of which is the Arianespace Vega-C — a light-lift launch vehicle now expected to debut in mid-2021. Levrini did not indicate what other rocket was being considered for the mission.

The CRISTAL prime contract is the second Copernicus deal that ESA has formalized since announcing its contractor selections for all six missions July 1. The first was a 445-million-euro contract that ESA signed with Germany’s OHB Space Systems July 31 to build a pair of satellites for the Copernicus Carbon Dioxide Monitoring mission. Instruments for that mission will be built by Thales Alenia Space.

The European Commission inaugurated its Copernicus environmental monitoring system in 2014 with the launch of the Sentinel 1-A radar satellite. Six more Sentinel satellites have followed, with seven now in orbit, the most recent of which — the Sentinel-3B oceanography satellite — was launched in 2018. The next Copernicus satellite, Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich, is slated to launch Nov. 10 from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999617338180542}",neutral,0.9999617338180542,0

What passenger experience future for Airbus hydrogen aircraft? - Runway Girl Network,"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjAvMDkvd2hhdC1wYXNzZW5nZXItZXhwZXJpZW5jZS1mdXR1cmUtZm9yLWFpcmJ1cy1oeWRyb2dlbi1haXJjcmFmdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has chosen its preferred technology for the next generation of aircraft power: hydrogen. With the release of three concepts in the regional to small airliner category — a turboprop, a turbofan and a blended wing body aircraft — as part of its “ZEROe” zero-emissions programme, the European airframer is aiming at a 2035 date to introduce this substantially less polluting power source for aircraft.

“France, land of innovation!” tweeted French president Emmanuel Macron at the news, and indeed it is promising to see this sort of futurism and big-picture thinking as the climate crisis continues to loom.

But it should be noted up front that Airbus is perhaps over-egging the pudding by calling these “climate-neutral, zero-emission commercial aircraft”. Hydrogen can be produced for fueling without direct carbon emissions, but it will have a supply chain, and whether it is burned or used in a fuel cell there will be some consequences at altitude.

A May 2020 report (PDF) by McKinsey for the European Union suggests that, for hydrogen, “combustion could reduce climate impact in flight by 50 to 75 percent and fuel-cell propulsion by 75 to 90 percent”.

Of the aircraft proposed, the smallest essentially looks like an update of the ATR 72 turboprop, but sized for “up to 100 passengers” over some 1000nm in range, slightly further than the Airbus-Leonardo turboprop in current service.

The next size up is a turbofan narrowbody carrying some 120-200 people for “2000+” nautical miles, which would give transcontinental range in the US, or all of China from Beijing. The aircraft rather resembles a size-adjusted A220 or A320.

Of note, the wings of both these aircraft are positioned around two thirds back on the aircraft rather than in the middle, which would take account of the substantial weight of the hydrogen compared with kerosene, but it’s not clear how weight and balance as the fuel is utilised would be managed.

On the inside, the passenger experiences on the turboprop and turbofan aircraft aren’t expected to be revolutionary, with Airbus vice president of engineering Jean-Brice Dumont highlighting in response to a question from Runway Girl Network that, “for the passengers, it shouldn’t mean a lot! It means being excited by flying with no climate impact. That’s the heart of the passenger. But seen by the passenger themselves, at least in two out of the three concept planes, it wouldn’t change much.”

The third aircraft is the most revolutionary design, a blended wing body that is clearly developed from the Airbus Maveric testbed demonstrator revealed only this February. Interestingly, the concept appears to have moved fairly swiftly to distributed propulsion along the rear rather than DC-10-style “banjo” turbofans on the Maveric project.

The shape of the aircraft, with a substantial part of the rear flattening out, could provide some interesting storage options for the hydrogen, especially if it is of a size to seat “up to 200 passengers” as Airbus suggests. But the scale of the blended wing body aircraft in the digital renderings that Airbus produced is curious.

The passenger doors and flight deck windows seem to be of a similar size, but if the door is two metres high then the rest of the aircraft could only seat perhaps five to ten passengers. Obviously this will need to scale up, but this — and indeed the lack of wheels on the rendering of the turboprop — raises questions about exactly where in the process Airbus is with all of this.

For passenger experience on the blended wing body, says Airbus’ engineering head Dumont, “it’s very exciting to see how we can modify the passenger cabin arrangement on a flying wing, but that’s a side topic to the development of hydrogen onboard the aircraft.”

It is clear that this is but the official start of a fifteen-year process to get a smaller hydrogen-powered aircraft certified and flying. There are many questions remaining: what precise method will be used to power the aircraft? How will fueling infrastructure be provided? What are the technology enablers needed? Just how much less polluting is hydrogen power, and how can this be minimised further? What is the ecosystem of other companies that needs to be in place to secure this future?

“Of course it’s not going to be easy,” says the airframer’s chief technology officer Grazia Vittadini. “But at Airbus we don’t like easy things. Let’s not forget that we are only fifty years old, and that we started from scratch… building the first widebody aircraft to cross the ocean on two engines. We’ve demonstrated it in the past, and we look forward to demonstrating it in the future.”

Airbus Debuts Plan for Hydrogen-powered Zero Emissions Plane - Travel + Leisure,"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGFuZGxlaXN1cmUuY29tL2FpcmxpbmVzLWFpcnBvcnRzL2FpcmJ1cy16ZXJvLWNhcmJvbi1lbWlzc2lvbnMtYWlycGxhbmVzLTIwMzXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus hopes to bring the world’s first zero-emission aircraft — powered by a hydrogen propulsion system — into commercial service by 2035.

“As recently as five years ago, hydrogen propulsion wasn’t even on our radar as a viable emission-reduction technology pathway,” Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus’s VP of Zero-Emission Aircraft, said in a statement on Monday. “But convincing data from other transport industries quickly changed all that. Today, we’re excited by the incredible potential hydrogen offers aviation in terms of disruptive emissions reduction.”

The manufacturer is also working on a concept aircraft called the ZEROe, which could reduce aircraft emissions by up to 50 percent. The ZEROe planes are hydrogen hybrid aircraft that use both liquid hydrogen fuel and a gas turbine, “resulting in a highly efficient hybrid-electric propulsion system,” according to the manufacturer.

In order to get the zero-emission aircraft into the air by 2035, Airbus hopes to launch its hybrid ZEROe aircraft program by 2025.

Over the coming months, Airbus engineers will launch several hydrogen demonstrator programs, hoping to perfect hydrogen propulsion. And by the late 2020s, Airbus hopes to have a full-scale aircraft prototype. But it will take a few years to decide what the plane will look like.

The three different iterations of the concept plane currently up for consideration include a turbofan (which most closely resembles common commercial aircraft today), a turboprop plane, and a blended-wing body, that looks like a flying manta ray.

“The ZEROe will be the world’s first zero-emission commercial aircraft,” says Jean-Brice. “As an engineer, I can’t think of working on anything more exciting than that.”

The global aviation industry is responsible for about two percent of the world’s carbon emissions and 12 percent of all emissions from transportation in general, according to Air Transport Action Group. The industry has also committed to halving its 2005 carbon emissions levels by 2050, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has said.

Why Airbus And Boeing May Need To Cut Production More - Aviation Week,"Wed, 09 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9hZXJvc3BhY2UvcHJvZ3JhbS1tYW5hZ2VtZW50L3doeS1haXJidXMtYm9laW5nLW1heS1uZWVkLWN1dC1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLW1vcmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Six months after commercial aerospace entered its worst-ever crisis, more data on traffic trends is becoming available, and analysts are beginning to better understand what the near- and long-term outlooks are for commercial aircraft production. New Aviation Week Intelligence Network data suggests demand will be down around 30% over the next 10 years compared to previous assumptions. The more worrying near-term threat is that OEMs have not yet cut production enough and will have to decide on more reductions quickly.

Some big-picture perspective is needed to recap where the industry is. Twenty-nineteen was the last year in what was called a super-cycle. Airlines in the U.S. in particular finally found ways to generate good profit margins, so good that American Airlines CEO Doug Parker predicted they would never suffer a loss again. Traffic growth flattened and overall airline profits declined toward the end of the last decade, but times were still really good.

Aircraft manufacturers believed in a never-ending growth cycle, too. Airbus at one point talked about monthly single-aisle production in excess of 70 aircraft. Boeing was chasing its rival, only to be held back by the grounding of the 737 MAX, angering customers that complained the OEM was destroying network expansion and profits at a time when more capacity was needed.

More aircraft production cuts loom, analysts say

Aviation week data suggests 16,000 deliveries in 10 years

Market contracts by 30% compared to previous forecasts

There is an argument that pre-COVID-19 production planning was too optimistic, even if the good times had persisted. In its 2019 global market forecast (GMF), Airbus projected a demand for 39,000 new aircraft over the next 20 years, while Boeing saw a market for 44,000 units. If Airbus’ projection had been accurate, the industry as a whole could have produced an average of 1,970 aircraft with more than 100 seats annually until 2038. But in 2019, Airbus and Boeing alone would have already ended up close to 1,900 aircraft had MAX deliveries continued as planned. Taking the GMF into account, there was already no more room for any growth beyond last year’s rates. And there was hardly any room left for existing or emerging competitors such as Embraer, Comac or United Aircraft Corp. (UAC) that would surely take a share of the large regional/small narrowbody demand—or more painful for Boeing and Airbus, the domestic China and Russia markets.

Going into the COVID-19 outbreak, the thinking was still that there would be a relatively short-term dip through which narrowbody deliveries could be sustained at a relatively high rate. That rate would have even allowed Boeing to resume some level of MAX deliveries from the end of this year or when regulators unground the aircraft. The target OEMs had in mind was to reach the level of production they were used to as quickly as possible. Only a few weeks ago, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury was still dreaming of a steep rise in narrowbody deliveries from 2022, which admittedly could still happen if things go exceptionally well. But the sentiment from most analysts has now changed. The summer, as illustrated by the July traffic figures released by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), continues to be disappointing. Global air travel is still down 80% from last year, and long-haul international travel is hardly existent as most countries keep some form of travel restrictions in place.

The outlook for the fall and winter, low seasons even in economic booms, is so frightening that IATA Director General and CEO Alexandre de Juniac is now calling for a second round of government bailouts: “The initial round of measures will need to be topped up, and the debt burden cannot be increased,” he said. According to IATA, governments have pumped around $120 billion into the airline sector globally to avoid financial collapse.

“If airline passenger volumes don’t start to improve meaningfully in 2021, we are likely to see further aircraft production rate cuts,” writes Jonathan Root, senior vice president at Moody’s Investors Service. Large commercial aircraft production will be around 30-40% lower than 2019 levels in 2021. New-aircraft build rates will partially depend on resumption of Boeing 737 MAX production, with manufacturing volumes for other aircraft remaining flat or even declining, Root wrote in an Aug. 27 report.

The outlook from credit analyst Root matches what a growing list of sell-side stock analysts are expecting. A trio of AllianceBernstein analysts told their investor clients on Aug. 24 that they are not seeing substantial improvement in prospects since a June industry report. Doug Harned, George Zhao and Caius Slater said they expect Airbus and Boeing to eventually deliver most airplanes currently in production, as airlines have already paid in cash and the aircraft have been built for specific carriers. But they see risk rising later this year and into 2021, with airlines reluctant to put more cash into progress payments.

“Even with high replacement demand, which we expect, production rate plans at Airbus and Boeing through 2023 are too high relative to deliveries,” they said. “This is particularly an issue for Airbus, which intends to produce 40 A320neos per month through 2021. Airbus was able to deliver those in July, but we do not believe that rate can be sustained. It is an issue for Boeing and Airbus on widebodies, [as both] are already delivering far fewer airplanes than they are producing. If one expects a global resolution of COVID issues in 2021 that could change the outlook. But we see the odds as against that.”

Agency Partners analyst Sash Tusa wrote to clients: “We remain very surprised that, given an arguably weakening COVID-19 backdrop, and impending oversupply as Boeing restarts 737 MAX deliveries, Airbus should even be talking about raising production rates, let alone from as early as the second half of 2021. We suspect that Airbus and Boeing are now playing a potentially damaging game of chicken: Neither will cut rates until airlines agree to pay the costs of the deferrals, especially since premature cuts might cede deliveries share to the competitor.”

Airbus so far cut rates for the A320neo family from 60 to 40 aircraft per month, for the A350 from 10 to five, and for the A330neo from five to around two. But Tusa argues more painful reductions have to be made. He predicts that A320neo rates will shrink to 24 aircraft per month in 2021, while A220 output will go from four per month in 2019 to two, new-build A350 aircraft will be down to three, and A330neo production will drop to two.

In 2025, Tusa expects Airbus to produce no more than 46 A320neo family aircraft monthly, as well as six A350s, six A220s and three A330neos.

However, Charles Armitage, European Aerospace and Defence analyst at Citi Research, has a different view. “What [Airbus] is doing is not stupid,” he says. “If you believe that 2,400 aircraft is the demand over the next four years, then it is a sensible thing to do.” He argues that it is not very painful to build up inventory in a low-interest-rate environment because it saves Airbus the difficulty of cutting back and then rebuilding in a few years and does not disrupt production unduly. The question is whether the market will recover to the expected level and when it will do so. “There are huge uncertainties,” Armitage says.

Another twist comes from the opportunities for order cancellation and deferral stemming from the MAX debacle. “Earlier this year, we thought having 737 MAX exposure was a liability for U.S. airlines, and in January we downgraded Southwest Airlines on this,” Vertical Research Partners wrote Aug. 19. “Now we view a MAX orderbook purely as a source of fleet optionality, a valuable asset when the demand outlook is less certain than ever.”

What Vertical’s Rob Stallard, Karl Oehlschlaeger and Darryl Genovesi mean is: Because Boeing has failed to meet its contractual commitments, firm MAX orders have become options for airlines to take MAX deliveries “if and when they see fit.” Vertical’s forecast is that Boeing will deliver only 45 MAXs this year and just 192 in 2021. That would equate to 53% of the currently parked MAX inventory, with the rest being delivered in 2022.

“While this means that our 737 production forecast is more elongated than Boeing’s plan of getting to 31 [aircraft per] month in early 2022, we still think there is downward risk to our estimates,” they add. “For airlines to be taking these 237 new MAX aircraft in 2020-21 is dependent on [recertification] timing, demand recovering, no further coronavirus waves, and no additional trade war flare-ups.”

According to the Aviation Week Intelligence Network forecast, the active global air transport fleet will be 10% smaller at the end of 2020, compared to a year earlier, thanks to a blend of retirements, temporary storage and a precipitous drop in deliveries. Looking further ahead, lower demand coming out of the novel coronavirus pandemic will reduce new-aircraft deliveries 30% in the decade ahead compared to pre-downturn projections.

Global passenger and cargo carriers will have 27,300 aircraft in service on Dec. 31, down from 30,500 at the start of the year, the revised figures show. The net decline of 3,200 aircraft includes a projected 720 retirements, or 2.4% of the active fleet.

Deliveries this year are projected to total just 895 aircraft. The timing of the Boeing 737 MAX return-to-service approvals could affect this number, as the manufacturer has more than 450 built MAXs sitting in storage that it would very much like to hand over to customers. Assuming regulators do not start granting MAX approvals much before late in the year, however, an aggregate delivery total of fewer than 1,000 new aircraft is a strong possibility.

If so, it would mark only the 10th time in the last three decades that air transport manufacturers jointly handed over fewer than 1,000 aircraft in a calendar year—and the first time since 2006. Last year’s total, held down by the MAX delivery halt that kept some 400 aircraft from entering service, was 1,425.

The drop in deliveries and jump in both retirements and temporary removals will leave the year-end 2020 global fleet of aircraft certified for 19 or more seats on par with 2015’s fleet size, underscoring the pandemic’s ramifications on global air traffic demand.

While retirements are on the rise, many stored aircraft are expected to rejoin operators’ fleets to support demand recovery. Aviation Week projects 2,100 aircraft returning from long-term storage by 2023.

The global fleet is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 2.4% in 2021-30, resulting in a fleet of 38,300 aircraft, the forecast says. New deliveries will total 16,200 during the decade—about 30% lower than prepandemic estimates.

Widebody deliveries likely will total about 2,500 during the 10-year stretch, which is 42% below the prepandemic forecast, reflecting the slower expected return of long-haul demand. Narrowbody deliveries will top 11,500—a 28% decline compared to prepandemic calculations. Regional jets, already on the decline, thanks largely to upgauging trends, are projected to account for 1,150 deliveries, or 38% less than before the COVID-19 outbreak.

In other words, there is room for an annual average of 1,150 narrowbody deliveries for the entire industry, 250 wide-bodies and 115 large regional jets. In 2018, Airbus and Boeing combined delivered 1,225 narrowbodies (and only 816 in 2019 because of the MAX grounding). The two OEMs handed over 380 widebodies in 2018 and 426 last year, showing the degree of contraction that is needed to adjust to the new demand level.

Airlines will permanently retire nearly 9,200 aircraft during the decade, the Aviation Week forecast shows. Calendar-year peaks are projected to come in 2028 and 2029, with each year expected to see more than 1,000 retirements.

The average of 920 retirements per year during the coming decade is a notable jump over recent figures. Aviation Week data shows that annual retirements in 2015-19 averaged 657 before climbing to a projected 720 in 2020, in part due to the pandemic’s fallout.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9896682500839233}",negative,0.9896682500839233,-1
Airbus Wants to Bring a Hydrogen-Powered Aircraft to Market by 2035 - DirectIndustry e-Magazine,"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vZW1hZy5kaXJlY3RpbmR1c3RyeS5jb20vMjAyMC8wOS8yMi9haXJidXMtd2FudHMtdG8tYnJpbmctYS1oeWRyb2dlbi1wb3dlcmVkLWFpcmNyYWZ0LXRvLW1hcmtldC1ieS0yMDM1L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has set the ambitious goal of being the first manufacturer to produce carbon-neutral jets by 2035. On Monday, the European aircraft manufacturer unveiled three hydrogen-powered aircraft concepts, as part of a several tens of billions of euros program code-named “ZEROe”. The first prototype could be flying by 2035.

What seemed impossible a few years ago is no longer a futuristic scenario. The first commercial flight of a hydrogen-powered jet could take off in 15 years. On Monday, September 21, Guillaume Faury, the CEO of aerospace company Airbus, unveiled its “zero-emission aircraft in 2035” project called “ZEROe”.

“The concepts offer the world a glimpse of our ambition to drive a bold vision for the future of zero-emission flight. I strongly believe that the use of hydrogen — both in synthetic fuels and as a primary power source for commercial aircraft — has the potential to significantly reduce aviation’s climate impact. This is a historic moment for the commercial aviation sector as a whole and we intend to play a leading role in the most important transition this industry has ever seen.”

This investment of several tens of billions of euros, if completed, will give the group a significant lead over its American and historical rival, Boeing.

Three New Models

Mr. Faury presented three aircraft concepts.

The first one is a conventional medium-haul twin-turbojet aircraft that could carry 120 to 200 passengers (like the A220 and A320). It could fly more than 3,500 kilometers, thanks to a gas turbine-powered by liquid hydrogen, instead of kerosene, stored in the rear part of the fuselage. In addition, the jet would be equipped with a fuel cell, also powered by hydrogen, to “bring extra power to the engines when needed,” explained Jean-Brice Dumont, Airbus’s Executive Vice President of Engineering.

Two other possible models are in the pipeline: a 100 seats jet with propellers for flights not exceeding 1,800 km; and a flying wing with about 200 seats with a much wider fuselage, favoring hydrogen storage and distribution, but also space for the passenger cabin. These aircraft were christened with the same name: “ZEROe”. “We can’t say which of the three will be the winner,” Dumont warns.

The coronavirus crisis, as well as the “flygskam movement” (“the shame of flying”) due to CO2 emissions (2 to 3% of global emissions come from air transportation), have put a strain on the aeronautics sector which is working twice as hard to move towards a carbon-neutral air transport.

Many Challenges

But the road to 2035 is long and the technological, industrial and financial challenges of such a program are enormous. Storage is one of the biggest problems. In an interview with French newspaper Le Parisien, Mr. Faury pointed out that hydrogen, when liquefied at -253°C and highly compressed in a cryogenic tank, occupies a volume four times bigger than that of kerosene.

But the tight schedule chosen by the group, which is not the usual aeronautical time scale, is a challenge. Indeed, the project involves a technological breakthrough but Airbus has five years to choose the best technology and two years to find suppliers and build the factories. So the program won’t be able to start before 2028.

Mr. Faury also recalled that airports will have to get prepared to handle hydrogen and build new transport and refueling infrastructure to meet the needs of day-to-day operations.

Finally, hydrogen will need to be produced in large quantities from renewable energies (hydraulic, wind, solar, etc.) and at a competitive cost.

All this is imperative if the sector wants the aircraft of tomorrow to be a profitable business model.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9955955147743225}",neutral,0.9955955147743225,0

Since July, Satair, an Airbus services company, has taken the lead on global material support and services for A220 operators, working in close coordination with the A220 programme team in Airbus Canada.

The transfer represents a key milestone for Airbus and a significant step in the overall further integration of the A220 programme. “All A220 customers will benefit from the same level of service and global network offered by Satair on all other Airbus platforms”, said Rob Dewar, Senior Vice President, A220 Customer Services, Customer Satisfaction and Product Policy. “This is a significant contributor to improving the overall satisfaction of our growing A220 customer base worldwide.”

“Satair’s footprint of service centres and warehouses will contribute to a greater scope of spare parts available for all A220 operators. Customers can look forward to leveraging Satair's global presence”, said Bart Reijnen, CEO of Satair. “We are very proud to be supporting the A220 aircraft with our strong Satair organization.”

The A220 material management services transition to Satair started officially on July 1st, 2020. Overall Satair is now in charge of a wide range of value-adding activities including planning & inventory; purchasing; quality inspection; certification; warehousing & distribution; customer order handling; 24/7 AOG handling; initial provisioning and tool lease. Over time, as the A220 fleet grows and also gains in maturity, Satair will also develop the areas of parts lease, repair and exchange for the A220. The customer order handling of the A220 programme is solely managed in the Satair | OEM parts and services channel with its global group of Satair companies.

The A220 programme headquarters are located in Mirabel, Canada together with main customer services functions, such as engineering expertise and 24/7/365 Customer Response Center.

Benefitting from the latest technologies, the A220 is the quietest, cleanest and most eco-friendly aircraft in its category. Featuring a 50% reduced noise footprint compared with previous generation aircraft, 25% lower fuel burn per seat and 50% lower NOx emissions than industry standards, the A220 is a great aircraft for neighbourhood airports.



The A220’s order book comprises 642 A220 aircraft on firm order as of end of July 2020.



As of end July 2020, 118 A220s have been delivered to seven operators and are being flown on routes in Asia, America, Europe and Africa, proving the great versatility of Airbus’ latest family member.

Airbus Presents Three Hydrogen-Powered Aircraft Concepts - Aviation Week,"Sun, 20 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9hZXJvc3BhY2UvYWlyYnVzLXByZXNlbnRzLXRocmVlLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLXBvd2VyZWQtYWlyY3JhZnQtY29uY2VwdHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is narrowing in on three concept studies for liquid-hydrogen-powered aircraft as it tries to define a next-generation commercial aircraft to enter service in 2035. The three concepts include a regional turboprop, a narrowbody in the A320neo-family size category and a blended wing body (BWB).

“Hydrogen is one of the most promising technologies,” Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said. “It has a lot of potential.”

In its preliminary studies, Airbus has come to the conclusion that of the various options, liquid hydrogen combustion is the most realistic technology path in the manufacturer’s efforts to produce what it hopes will effectively be a carbon-neutral aircraft. “We don’t need to invest in technologies that are completely disruptive,” he said.

Airbus, like all aircraft manufacturers and the civil aviation industry as a whole, is under enormous political pressure to reduce its environmental impact after it recovers from the coronavirus pandemic. The European aircraft-maker can benefit from massive government funding in hydrogen research both in France and Germany—state budget allocations that are intended to keep forced redundancies at Airbus and other aerospace companies to a minimum while also accelerating aviation’s transition to a greener future. The French government in particular has made clear that it expects a hydrogen aircraft, for which it has provided research funding, to enter service by 2035.

“A lot of investment is needed, and we have to be fast,” Faury said. “But we are very convinced.”

Airbus’ timeline foresees five years (until 2025) to mature technologies and more closely define which of the three avenues it will pursue further for the 2035 aircraft. “It is fair to assume that we will start small and go up in size over time,” Faury said. But he does not rule out that the first aircraft could be a narrowbody or that the narrowbody could be developed in parallel with the turboprop—noting that Airbus worked on the A350 and the A380 simultaneously.

Faury foresees the formal industrial launch in 2027 or 2028, preceded by two years of work to set up an industrial concept, negotiating with partners and suppliers as well as work on the business case. Airbus is allocating around seven years for the actual development phase, similar to conventional aircraft.

The liquid-hydrogen-powered narrowbody would likely have the most transformative effect on civil aviation. Airbus is looking at a family of aircraft with 120-200 seats and a range of 2,000 nm or more. The aircraft would be somewhat smaller than the current A320neo family, which ranges from around 130 to more than 240 seats, depending on the configuration of the A319neo, A320neo and A321neo.

The narrowbody concept is planned to be designed for a Mach 0.78 cruise speed, and its liquid hydrogen combustion would be complemented by a hybrid-electric system powered by fuel cells. A conventional tube-and-wing lay-out is the target, although the fuselage would be significantly longer to accommodate large hydrogen tanks in the rear.

A range of 2,000 nm or somewhat more is significantly shorter than that of the A320neo (3,400 nm), but it would be enough to cover all of Europe. A range well in excess of 2,000 nm would be needed for U.S. transcontinental services.

Faury is leaving open for now whether the hydrogen aircraft will be the only successor to the current A320neo family or whether another more conventional design—using synthetic fuels to reduce its environmental footprint—might complement or precede it. “Two things could be combined or could be independent in terms of timing or solution,” he said.

The A320neo will have been in service for almost 20 years by 2035; its first delivery came in 2016.

Faury concedes there are major challenges to making the new-technology aircraft a reality. Massive investment in ground infrastructure would be required to ensure that “decarbonized hydrogen is available at airports,” he said. Aviation will also need “a regulatory framework that is very different from today’s, and we will have to have clarity in 2027 or 2028,” he pointed out.

Accommodating liquid hydrogen tanks on the aircraft is a challenge manufacturers, including Airbus, have been studying for decades. The size and weight of liquid hydrogen tanks differ from kerosene tanks, and storing liquid hydrogen safely is a crucial hurdle. Faury made clear that “the level of safety has to be comparable to today’s aircraft.”

But Airbus’ biggest challenge may well be convincing industry partners that it is time for the jump to new propulsion technology, even though it might require limited changes to current engines. Sources in the engine industry are not sharing Airbus’ enthusiasm, yet their participation is imperative for the project to succeed.

And Airbus does not claim hydrogen is a solution for all segments, not even for decades. Synthetic fuels are “a low-risk solution at an affordable cost for long-haul flying,” Faury said. He did admit that the rise of hydrogen could have an impact on the already difficult business case for synthetic fuels, which are far from being available in anything near industrial quantities. Yet the two concepts could serve different applications, he said, noting that where they don’t, “competition is healthy.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9904831647872925}",neutral,0.9904831647872925,0

The investigation itself was fascinating. The results, less so. It’s hard to believe that BEA even tried to find the engine, let alone succeed in recovering it. But in a matter of days investigators did all of that, in large part because it was an urgent matter. After all, no one knew why the fan and inlet cowling had failed and separated in flight. Was it a problem that would recur on other A380s?

The crews were just changing over as they cruised along over Greenland with 497 passengers and 24 crewmembers on board, heading to Los Angeles from Paris when the number-four engine stalled, as indicated by a warning in the cockpit, and then failed altogether. The flight diverted to Goose Bay, Canada, where it landed without incident.

The quick response is impressive. But how does one find an engine fan and inlet cowling separated in flight? How do you find a big part of a giant engine in a vast wilderness of ice? Well, you use the flight data recorder and go from there.

For starters, Denmark, which has jurisdiction over Greenland where the engine failed, designated French BEA team to take charge of the investigation. They did so with help from Airbus, the Alliance GP7200 engine manufacturers (GE and Pratt & Whitney are 50/50 partners on the engine), the NTSB and others.

Amazingly, within days of the accident—it’s classified as such—investigators located the area in Greenland where the engine had failed and fallen off, and dispatched teams to find it. And it’s a good thing they hurried, because the fan was already buried in more than 10 feet of snow, and it was hard enough to dig it out from that depth. No doubt, but people got some exercise.

Despite the sterling effort from all involved, the report, issued this week, is less than reassuring. Investigators, who were looking for a smoking gun as to why the engine failed and the fan separated, wanted something reassuring to say to the world. The report does anything but. While it’s very technical in nature about the metallurgy involved in the manufacture of such engines, the report’s authors essentially said that it found nothing to show why the engine failed.

It did conclude that there were several areas of concern that were “likely to have contributed to the accident.” These are all associated with the properties of the titanium alloy, Ti-6-4, used in the components that failed and the risk that the material is more susceptible to failure in larger structures. The Alliance GP7200-series engine is one of the largest turbofans in the world. It’s outfitted on just under half of A380s in the fleet, with the Roll-Royce Trent 900, the original A380 engine, comprising the slight majority.

There have been, thank goodness, no recurrences of the issue, though the thought of what might have happened if things had gone slightly differently should be enough to motivate those scientists and engineers looking for an answer.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.5690350532531738}",negative,0.5690350532531738,-1
Airbus Unveils Hydrogen Designs for Zero-Emission Flight - SupplyChainBrain,"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1cHBseWNoYWluYnJhaW4uY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzMxOTM0LWFpcmJ1cy11bnZlaWxzLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLWRlc2lnbnMtZm9yLXplcm8tZW1pc3Npb24tZmxpZ2h00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"European planemaker Airbus SE unveiled three designs it’s studying to build hydrogen-powered aircraft as it races to bring a zero-carbon passenger plane into service by 2035.

The approaches include a turbofan jet with capacity for as many as 200 passengers — similar to its A321neo narrow-body — that can fly more than 2,000 nautical miles, according to a statement. It would be powered by a modified gas-turbine engine running on hydrogen.

The manufacturer also showed a design for a propeller plane which would seat about 100 passengers for smaller distances, and a flying-wing concept with 200 seats.

Hydrogen is becoming an increasing area of focus for Airbus as it evaluates technologies for emission-free flight. The company is under pressure from the French and German governments, its biggest shareholders, to speed development of new aircraft after aiding the planemaker during the coronavirus crisis. Together, the two countries have committed some 2.5 billion euros ($2.9 billion) toward cleaner propulsion.

While there are different approaches, hydrogen is likely to be used in aerospace and other industries to meet climate-neutral targets, Airbus said. The company has already said it’s targeting the mid-2030s for the first zero-emission passenger jet. Developing a hydrogen aircraft on that timeline will be a real challenge because of the massive amounts of infrastructure and government investment required.

“The question is how big can we go with batteries,” said Glenn Llewellyn, vice president of zero-emissions technology at Airbus, in a briefing. “We don’t believe that it’s a today-relevant technology for commercial aircraft and we see hydrogen having more potential.”

Airbus said it plans to test the three designs over the next five years.

In the turbofan design, liquid hydrogen will be stored and distributed through tanks located behind the rear pressure bulkhead, while at the same time hydrogen fuel cells will create electric power that complements the gas turbine. The turboprop will also use modified gas-turbine engines.

The blended-wing plan, resembling a flying V, opens up new options for hydrogen storage and distribution, along with cabin layout. It is the most challenging out of the three designs, according to the company’s chief engineer, Jean-Brice Dumont.

If the company gets everything right immediately it can consider moving ahead with the “revolutionary” V-shaped model, he said. Otherwise it is likely to choose one of the other two, more classic designs and look at developing such an aircraft later.

The company, based in Toulouse, France, plans to launch several hydrogen demonstrator programs over the next few months. It expects it will take another two years to choose suppliers and manufacturing sites before the program is scheduled for around 2028, and the aircraft comes into service in 2035. The program will likely cost Airbus billions, said Dumont.

Infrastructure Requirements

The success of any such program would depend on infrastructure at airports and support from governments to fund development, as well as incentives for airlines to retire older aircraft, Airbus said. The company has already started discussions with airports, airlines and energy companies. It is also calling on governments to put the right incentives in place to push the industry to shift toward hydrogen power.

The French state is backing research into low-carbon flight and sees Airbus’ development of a hydrogen powered plane as the best answer to “aviation bashing,” French Transport Minister Jean-Baptiste Djebbari said on LCI Television Monday.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999009370803833}",neutral,0.9999009370803833,0
Airbus A321 embarks on second act in e-commerce - FreightWaves,"Wed, 16 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWlnaHR3YXZlcy5jb20vbmV3cy9haXJidXMtYTMyMS1lbWJhcmtzLW9uLXNlY29uZC1hY3QtaW4tZS1jb21tZXJjZdIBVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWlnaHR3YXZlcy5jb20vbmV3cy9haXJidXMtYTMyMS1lbWJhcmtzLW9uLXNlY29uZC1hY3QtaW4tZS1jb21tZXJjZS9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Australia’s Qantas Airways is scheduled this month to receive the world’s first Airbus A321 converted from a passenger configuration into a freighter. Aviation engineering firms are gearing up to produce more A321 converted freighters, which experts say is ideal for domestic and regional express carriers that fly e-commerce shipments.

The arrival of the freighter — the first narrowbody aircraft with space for containers in the lower deck — comes at an opportune time. The coronavirus greatly constrained air cargo capacity by decimating airline passenger networks that carry the majority of the world’s air shipments and spurred a surge in online shopping as people protect themselves from infection by avoiding brick-and-mortar stores.

Airlines, lessors and conversion houses say the A321 is an attractive airframe for a converted freighter because of a 20% advantage in fuel efficiency for its class, lower operating costs and the available feedstock of aircraft. It beats the Boeing 737 converted freighter with 50% more capacity — or 9 more tons — and is viewed by all-cargo operators as the best replacement for older Boeing 757s.

It is also the first narrowbody freighter able to carry small containers and pallets on the lower deck. The 737 and 757 only take bulk cargo below because their doors are smaller. Overall, the A320 family can accommodate 14 containers on the main deck and 10 more in the belly hold.

“The A321 passenger-to-freighter has the potential to be the game changer for any hub-and-spoke or point-to-point cargo operation,” Steve Zissis, CEO of BBAM Aircraft Leasing and Management, said in February after his company placed two firm orders for the planes from Elbe Flugzeugwerke GmbH (EFW). “For this reason, we made the decision to offer this conversion solution to our customers.”

Qantas’ freight division plans to take up to three A321 converted freighters. Vallair, a Luxembourg-based aviation leasing company, is delivering the first one. Vallair has acquired 10 of the planes and hired EFW to convert most of them over two years. The Dresden, Germany, engineering house is a joint venture between Airbus and ST Engineering in Singapore. Qantas has also ordered a converted A321 from Keystone Holdings, an ST Engineering leasing joint venture.

Qantas Freight will operate the converted narrowbody planes for Australia Post, which is experiencing consistent strong growth each year in parcels tendered by e-commerce retailers.

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and the European Aviation Safety Agency certified EFW’s conversion design for the A321 in late July and February, respectively. Modifications include adding a large cargo door in the forward fuselage area and a reinforced barrier wall in the upper deck to protect the crew cabin from shifting cargo. Seats and other features designed specifically for passengers must also be removed.





Air Transport Services Group (NASDAQ: ATSG), which operates all-cargo aircraft for Amazon and DHL Express, is also developing an A321-200 converted freighter through a joint venture with Precision Aircraft Solutions in Portland, Oregon. Vallair is the launch customer for 321 Precision Conversions, the joint venture, and has placed the aircraft with an unnamed European operator.

The initial test flight is scheduled for the first week of October in Florida. FAA approval for a supplemental certificate allowing the modification is likely to spill into early 2021 because COVID-related precautions have delayed some inspections, Brian McCarthy, Precision’s vice president of sales and marketing, said in an interview.

ATSG’s strategy is to convert the A321s itself and then place them with its two biggest customers, but 321 Precision Conversions is set up to serve the broader industry. The narrowbody Airbus aircraft will complement the B767 currently operated by ATSG’s charter providers ABX Air and Air Transport International.

“The A321 will be the base of an express network freighter,” providing linehaul service along with the medium-size Boeing 767, ATSG CEO Rich Corrado said in an interview for the summer issue of “Air Cargo Focus,” the in-house magazine of Cargo Network Services Corp. “The A321’s cubic volume is very close to the B757 freighter, which with its installed base of over 300 aircraft, is getting long in the tooth. This should create a great market” for the Airbus product.”

ATSG disclosed in financial reports that it has contributed $6.8 million so far to the joint venture with Precision to develop the A321 converted freighter.

Precision does the design and engineering, manufactures the cargo doors and surround structures, manages installation and airworthiness certification, and handles product support, warehousing and logistics.

Avocet Aviation Services in Sanford, Florida, near Orlando, is building the prototype and likely will get the initial orders, McCarthy said. A network of authorized installation facilities is being planned for when volume increases, which could include ATSG subsidiary Pemco Conversions in Tampa, Florida, as well as sites in Europe and China.

Precision Aircraft currently converts other planes in Chengdu, China, through a company called Ameco.





Airbus forecasts about 1,000 small freighter conversions will be required during the next 20 years, with the A321 a strong candidate to meet that demand.

More freighers for e-commerce

E-commerce is driving more new investment in cargo aircraft than general air cargo, and smaller planes are becoming more desirable for operators.

The global e-commerce market is expected to grow to $2.4 trillion this year from $1.8 trillion in 2019, according to Research and Markets. It forecasts the market will grow to $3.1 trillion at a compound annual growth rate of 14% through 2023, enabled by rising Internet penetration and growing use of smartphones, before stabilizing.

The U.S. Department of Commerce reported that second-quarter domestic e-commerce sales grew by almost a third from the previous quarter and 44.5% from the same period a year ago, while e-commerce’s share of total retail sales jumped to 16.1% from 10.8% year-over year.

eMarketer estimates e-commerce will make up 14.5% of U.S. retail sales this year, up from 11% last year — the largest year-over-year increase since it began tracking the industry in 2008.

COVID-19 has increased online demand for essential supplies such as food, medicine, hand sanitizer, tissue and disinfectants, as well as electronics, leisure clothing and outdoor sporting goods useful during a period of self-isolation, analysts and logistics providers say.

During the second quarter, the gross merchandise value for e-commerce sales increased 45% from 2019, according to a graph posted on LinkedIn by Jason Goldberg, chief strategist at Retailgeek Consulting. Best Buy experienced a 242% increase in Internet sales, with Ulta, Target and Dick’s Sporting Goods all near 200% growth in the category.

By comparison, aircraft manufacturers and airlines project long-term growth for general air cargo to be in the 3% to 4% range.

Transportation providers are under increased pressure to help online retailers meet customer expectations for faster fulfillment of online orders. Smaller cargo jets can bring packages closer to the end user by using secondary airports outside big cities and are better suited for the shorter routes e-commerce networks need to ship freight more frequently.

Online shipments contributed to ATSG’s strong profit and revenue growth in the second quarter.

Good value for used aircraft

Interest in the A321 converted freighter has increased since the pandemic started, said Alistair Dibisceglia, chief leasing and trading officer at Vallair.

Lower acquisition costs are helping the conversion case. With a glut of passenger planes grounded by anemic travel demand due to the coronavirus, values have decreased, although aircraft consultant Stephen Fortune encouraged investors in a recent note to wait until the market drops closer to its bottom.

Dibisceglia told FreightWaves that Vallair is evaluating more than 20 A321-200s for purchase after market values fell 5% to 14% in the second quarter following an earlier drop in January.

At the start of 2020, there were 65 A321s already parked because of airline failures, including the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook a year ago, which unexpectedly dumped 36 of the planes into the market. Airlines were expected to lease many of those surplus aircraft to meet travel demand during the popular summer season, but the pandemic killed those plans. The number of A321s in circulation is also higher, Dibisceglia explained, because the grounding of the 737 MAX 18 months ago after two fatal crashes led airlines to acquire A321s to fill the capacity void.

“The pandemic has increased the number of available assets which for us is unprecedented. We are focused on increasing our feedstock,” he said.

Rather than be stuck with unusable assets that airlines returned prematurely, many lessors are making the uncomfortable decision to convert planes that are only 10 to 12 years old, McCarthy said. Owners have to spend several million dollars for the conversion and accept lower lease rates than for a passenger aircraft, which pushes back the timeline for depreciation and recouping the initial investment. But that can be preferable to no revenue stream, expensive storage fees and maintenance for returning planes to service, as well as the serious degradation of components associated with inactivity.

Usually passenger aircraft are candidates for conversion when the airframe is close to scrap value, with the overall price dictated by the engine.

“We’re looking at planes with 20,000 flight hours, which is crazy. We never see planes that young,” McCarthy said.

Integrated logistics companies with their own airlines — Amazon, DHL, FedEx, UPS — typically take a much longer view than hedge funds and other aircraft investors because they often pay for aircraft in cash and depreciate them over 15 years or more, he explained.

“They’re fixated on reliability; it’s a different school of thought,” Precision Aircraft’s sales chief said.

Brittain Ladd, a supply chain management and e-commerce fulfillment guru who spent two years at Amazon working on the company’s grocery strategy, agreed: The A321 “will be a step up,” he said

In addition to an extra main rotor blade, the new version of the enduringly popular aircraft adds a bearingless main rotor system with a fully composite flex-beam and main rotor blades. It also dispenses with the main rotor head entirely. The net result is an increase of 330 pounds (150 kilograms) in useful load over the four-bladed H145.

The type includes upgraded avionics in the form of Airbus’s Wireless Airborne Communication System, which allows navigation and mission database information to be imported from a tablet, and has the capability for cockpit Wi-Fi.

The variant is offered as a new aircraft off the production line, or through a retrofit kit for operators of the four-bladed H145.

“I would like to thank the Norwegian Air Ambulance Foundation for their trust in our helicopters and especially in the H145 family of helicopters. I can’t wait to see this new version in operation, contributing to the success of life-saving missions,” said Bruno Even, Airbus Helicopters’ CEO. “Our teams have worked hard to bring this enhanced multi-mission helicopter to the market quickly.”

Hans Morten Lossius, Secretary General of Norwegian Air Ambulance Foundation, said the organization was proud to be the launch customer for the variant. “The increased useful load and the smooth flight make the new H145 the perfect choice . . . to further push the boundaries and enhance helicopter emergency medical services [HEMS] in Norway and in the whole air ambulance community.”

Aircraft to be used for medical research

The Norwegian Air Ambulance Foundation, founded by Norwegian doctor Jens Moe in 1978, is the mother company and owner of the Norwegian Air Ambulance. It brought HEMS to Norway by opening a first base near Oslo, using a BO105 helicopter rented from Germany. Today, Norwegian Air Ambulance operates all 13 HEMS bases in Norway and all four bases in Denmark using a fleet of H135s and H145s.

The new H145 will now be flown to Norway, where the Norwegian Air Ambulance will install an Aerolite interior to enable it to fly HEMS missions. “Our main target with this aircraft is research and development projects,” said Erik Normann, director of flight operations development at the Norwegian Air Ambulance. “Of course, part of medical research is flying actual patients, so we will put it into service towards the end of this year.”

Normann said the aircraft would be “an important tool” in the organization’s research projects.

These include a wide variety of different medical research projects, from testing small devices that could help the service in their daily work, to more ambitious projects.

Among the latter is the idea of carrying a CT scanner on board a helicopter. “A CT scanner is normally 400 to 500 kilograms, located in a hospital,” said Normann. “We would like to put it in this aircraft to improve stroke treatment dramatically.”

The organization has another two five-bladed H145s on order, and also plans to retrofit its entire fleet of four-bladed H145s to the five-bladed version when the kit to do so is available.

The five-bladed H145 was initially unveiled at Heli-Expo 2019 in Atlanta, Georgia.

The European Union Aviation Safety Agency certified the type in June. Axel Humpert, senior vice president and head of the H145 program at Airbus, said the Federal Aviation Administration “is close to finalizing the validation” of the new type, and he expected to have it confirmed “definitely this year.” Humpert added that Airbus is “very close” to signing a contract for the first military customer for the type.

Airbus currently has 90 orders for the five-bladed H145, and 80 orders for the retrofit kit.

The certification for the military version of the five-bladed H145 will be granted in 2021. The H145 is developed jointly with Kawasaki Heavy Industries. The first delivery by the Japanese cooperation partner is scheduled for early next year.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9571914076805115}",neutral,0.9571914076805115,0
"airbus ZEROe concept — three zero-emission, hydrogen-fueled aircraft - Designboom","Mon, 21 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlc2lnbmJvb20uY29tL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvYWlyYnVzLXplcm9lLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLWFpcnBsYW5lcy0wOS0yMS0yMDIwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"airbus has unveiled three zero-emission commercial aircraft concepts that could take to the skies by 2035. dubbed ZEROe, the game-changing concepts are powered by hydrogen, a disruptive zero-emission technology aiming to reduce aircraft emissions by up to 50%.



images by airbus

each airbus ZEROe concept represents a different approach to achieving zero-emission flight, exploring different technology paths and aerodynamic configurations in order to pave the way in the decarbonization of the aviation industry. one of the concepts looks like a classical commercial aircraft; another resembles a turboprop-powered airliner; and the third is a blended-wing body — a ground-breaking design with an exceptional wide interior. what ties them is the hydrogen propulsion.

‘as recently as five years ago, hydrogen propulsion wasn’t even on our radar as a viable emission-reduction technology pathway,’ explains glenn llewellyn, airbus VP, zero-emission aircraft. ‘but convincing data from other transport industries quickly changed all that. today, we’re excited by the incredible potential hydrogen offers aviation in terms of disruptive emissions reduction.’

to fly, the airbus ZEROe concepts are powered by modified gas-turbine engines that burn liquid hydrogen as fuel. simultaneously, they also use hydrogen fuel cells to create electrical power, complementing the gas turbine and resulting in a highly efficient hybrid-electric propulsion system. ‘I strongly believe that the use of hydrogen – both in synthetic fuels and as a primary power source for commercial aircraft – has the potential to significantly reduce aviation’s climate impact,’ says guillaume faury, airbus CEO.

the three concepts – all code-named ZEROe – include: a turbofan design (120-200 passengers) with a range of 2,000+ nautical miles, capable of operating transcontinentally; a turboprop design (up to 100 passengers) using a turboprop engine instead of a turbofan and also powered by hydrogen combustion in modified gas-turbine engines, which would be capable of traveling more than 1,000 nautical miles, making it a perfect option for short-haul trips; and a blended-wing body design (up to 200 passengers) concept in which the wings merge with the main body of the aircraft with a range similar to that of the turbofan concept.

‘these concepts will help us explore and mature the design and layout of the world’s first climate-neutral, zero-emission commercial aircraft, which we aim to put into service by 2035,’ concludes faury. ‘the transition to hydrogen, as the primary power source for these concept planes, will require decisive action from the entire aviation ecosystem. together with the support from government and industrial partners we can rise up to this challenge to scale-up renewable energy and hydrogen for the sustainable future of the aviation industry.’

Airbus to launch hydrogen commercial aircraft by 2035 | electrive.com - www.electrive.com,"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsZWN0cml2ZS5jb20vMjAyMC8wOS8yMS9haXJidXMtaXMtcGxhbm5pbmctaDItY29tbWVyY2lhbC1haXJjcmFmdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has presented three concepts for the world’s first zero-emission commercial aircraft, which could enter service by 2035. All these concepts, code-named ZEROe, rely on hydrogen as the main energy source, but each follows a different approach.

With the announcement of the three aircraft studies, Airbus wants to put itself at the forefront of the transformation in aviation. According to the company, the trio’s various technological paths and aerodynamic configurations should give it a “pioneering role in the decarbonisation of the entire aviation industry”. The company describes hydrogen as a primary energy source as an extremely promising solution.

“I strongly believe that the use of hydrogen – both in synthetic fuels and as a primary power source for commercial aircraft – has the potential to significantly reduce aviation’s climate impact,” says Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury, who is not stingy with superlatives: “This is a historic moment for the commercial aviation sector as a whole and we intend to play a leading role in the most important transition this industry has ever seen,” says the Group CEO.

Faury calls the three concepts a “bold vision” for the future of emission-free flying. In detail, Airbus is showing an aircraft study with a turbofan engine for 120 to 200 passengers and an estimated range of more than 2,000 nautical miles, equivalent to 3,700 kilometres. The aircraft transports the liquid hydrogen in tanks beyond the rear pressure bulkhead. According to the manufacturer, it is suitable for transcontinental flights.

The second study is a smaller aircraft with a propeller turbine (“turboprop”) for up to 100 passengers. Here, too, the modified gas turbine engines are powered by the combustion of hydrogen. With a range of a good 1,000 nautical miles (about 1,850 kilometres), the aircraft is expected to attract some attention, especially for short-haul routes.

Airbus calls the third concept an aircraft with “blended-wing body”, i.e. with wings that merge with the main body of the aircraft. The aircraft should be able to carry up to 200 passengers and have a range of 2,000 nautical miles, or about 3,700 kilometres. According to Airbus, the study’s unusually wide fuselage opens up numerous options for both hydrogen storage and distribution, as well as for the cabin layout.

“These concepts will help us explore and mature the design and layout of the world’s first climate-neutral, zero-emission commercial aircraft, which we aim to put into service by 2035,” says Faury. The transition to hydrogen as the primary energy source for these concept aircraft requires decisive action by the entire aviation ecosystem, he said. “Together with the support from government and industrial partners we can rise up to this challenge to scale-up renewable energy and hydrogen for the sustainable future of the aviation industry,” he concluded.

Airbus also points out that airports will need an extensive infrastructure for hydrogen transport and refuelling in the future to meet the demands of daily operations. According to the largest European aircraft manufacturer, this can only work if public funding for research and digitalisation in general and the more specifically, the development of sustainable fuel technologies and the renewal of aircraft fleets is increased. In other words: Airbus is signalling that it is actively driving forward the radical changes in aviation, but wants the risk to be shared by governments.

At Airbus, ZEROe follows a bumpy development project called E-Fan X. Launched in 2017 together with Siemens and Rolls-Royce, the project aimed to equip a 100-seat regional aircraft with a hybrid-electric drive train for the first time by 2020. But as early as May 2019, it was announced that Airbus and Siemens had ended their cooperation for hybrid-electric aircraft drives ahead of schedule. Airbus announced the official end of the overall project in May of this year, without a study even taking off.

The fact is that the meagre outcome of the project has only limited connection to the Covid-19 pandemic and the drastic economic consequences for the entire aviation industry. At Airbus, former CEO Tom Enders was seen as the driving force behind the project. The German manager expressed his confidence in developing hybrid drives for medium-sized aircraft by 2030. However, with Guillaume Faury’s move to the top of the company and the appointment of Grazia Vittadini as Chief Technology Officer, the hybrid course at Airbus has changed. The focus is now clearly on hydrogen.

Since then, 180 A320 family aircraft have been built in Alabama for eight airline customers. The Alabama-made passenger jets have flown 60 million passengers 500 million miles, according to Airbus.

“When we announced our intent to build A320 family aircraft in the United States, and to locate that facility in Mobile, Alabama, we also stated our intent to be a good neighbor, to create jobs and opportunities, and to help strengthen the U.S. aerospace industry,” said president and CEO of Airbus Americas C. Jeffrey Knittel.

The Airbus facility at the Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley directly employs more than 1,000 people. Earlier this year, Airbus opened a second assembly line at the complex that produces A220 aircraft. The operation represents an investment of around $1 billion.

“The achievements of the Airbus U.S. Manufacturing team over these past five years are just the beginning,” Knittel said. “We are proud to call Mobile our American aircraft manufacturing home, and we look forward to many more years of partnership with the community, our customers and suppliers.”

“Airbus has announced a series of expansions over the past few years that have placed Alabama on the map as a leader in the aerospace industry. Business analysts predict that by 2023, Alabama will be number 4 or 5 in the world for the production of commercial aircraft,” said economic developer Nicole Jones. “This is a testament to teamwork and strategic partnerships between the public and private sector as well as the quality, dedicated, and skilled workforce Alabamians provide and companies need. Alabama has a history of leadership in aerospace and aviation, and Airbus is an international pioneer in the industry. We are thankful to Airbus team for their continued commitment to our state, nation, and the world.”

This has been an extremely difficult year for the airline industry due to far less business travel, decreased tourist travel and many nations imposing travel restrictions for people from other countries due to the threat of the coronavirus. Many airlines are asking Congress to provide more stimulus dollars.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9657605886459351}",neutral,0.9657605886459351,0

Airliners Could Fly in Formation | Why Do Birds Fly Together? - Popular Mechanics,"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHVsYXJtZWNoYW5pY3MuY29tL2ZsaWdodC9haXJsaW5lcy9hMzQwNTQwNTEvYWlybGluZXJzLWZseS1pbi1mb3JtYXRpb24tYmlyZHMtYWlyYnVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review.

An experimental Airbus concept shows airplanes flying in formation to save fuel.

This concept carefully capitalizes on wake turbulence, which engineers have fought against for more than a century.

Birds are hard to study, and we still don't understand their flight formations well.



Could passenger planes begin flying in formation to draft each other’s wingtip vortex effects? One Airbus-based startup concept thinks so. The concept uses a formation idea inspired by birds, who commute north to south and back in large V shapes to capitalize on the updraft generated by the birds in front.

✈ You love badass planes. So do we. Let's nerd out over them together.

When airplanes push through the air at high speeds, they generate something called wingtip vortex, also called wake turbulence, even though it’s not true turbulence at all. True turbulence is more like the way fall leaves follow and swirl in circles after a car passes through, because cars are not as aerodynamic and are usually interacting with more complex surroundings. Wingtip vortex is so uniform and predictable that it lingers in the air for minutes and can even work to pull on the airplane, which is called vortex drag.

You Have to Read This The Epic Quest To Build a Better Airplane Wing

In the concept pushed by the Airbus incubator, appropriately named “fello’fly,” planes line up over a mile apart, which is still close enough to benefit from the wingtip vortices generated on either side of the lead plane.

Airbus

This sounds like a good idea, and when employed in the right way, it really can be. But it’s counterintuitive to a lot of ideas pilots are taught about wake turbulence.

“Extremely powerful vortices—especially those generated by a large aircraft—have been known to flip smaller planes that have encountered the horizontal tornado of air streaming behind,” CNN explains . “Avoiding wake turbulence is part of a student pilot's curriculum, as it will be in the fello'fly demonstration.”

To ride the wave without facing adverse outcomes, fello’fly planes will use an updraft of air that’s just outside the tube of wingtip vortex. That means careful planning and formation that’s more offset to make sure the planes truly follow in the updraft instead of the vortex. The updraft they want to ride is invisible, but basically, the planes will bodysurf in the most advantageous portion of the full spread of wake from the lead plane.

Maverick and Goose Would Be Proud 'Top Gun' Scene Recreated in Flight Simulator

Let’s use an analogy everyone understands: Top Gun. In the movie, Tom Cruise practices extremely close formation flying, and the climactic events are caused by something the characters refer to as jetwash. Unlike wake turbulence, jetwash, which is an umbrella term for the massively propelled air and gases that flow out of jet engines, is definitely highly turbulent. In the context of the movie, that idea is used to suggest that fighter jets can basically stall out within that turbulent blast.

Our Favorite Hobby RC Planes

Wake turbulence is less of an immediate threat, although flipping planes is still a big deal that can disorient pilots and cause dangerous complications.

Think about driving a small motorboat when a yacht or even a cruise ship passes and being swamped and tossed around in the larger boat’s wake. But a carefully controlled and technology assisted formation, Airbus says, could mean lower fuel costs—a reduction of 5 to 10 percent.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999032020568848}",neutral,0.9999032020568848,0
Airbus releases three zero-emission flight concepts - Lonely Planet Travel News,"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxvbmVseXBsYW5ldC5jb20vbmV3cy9haXJidXMtemVyby1lbWlzc2lvbi1mbGlnaHQtY29uY2VwdHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sustainable travel is high on everyone's agenda, so the news that Airbus has revealed three concepts for the world’s first zero-emission commercial aircraft is a very positive one .

The concepts each represent a different approach to achieving zero-emission flights, and they could enter service by 2035. They explore various technology pathways and aerodynamic configurations, but all rely on hydrogen as a primary power source. Airbus believes it holds exceptional promise as a clean aviation fuel, and feels it is likely to be a solution for aerospace and many other industries to meet their climate-neutral targets.

The concepts include a turbofan design that can hold between 120 and 200 passengers, with a range of over 2000 nautical miles. It is capable of operating transcontinentally and is powered by a modified gas-turbine engine running on hydrogen through combustion. The liquid hydrogen will be stored and distributed via tanks located behind the rear pressure bulkhead.

The second concept is a turboprop design, designed to hold up to 100 passengers using a turboprop engine. Also powered by hydrogen combustion in modified gas-turbine engines, it would be capable of traveling more than 1000 nautical miles, making it a perfect option for short-haul trips.

The third concept is a a “blended-wing body” design concept in which the wings merge with the main body of the aircraft with a range similar to that of the turbofan concept. The exceptionally wide fuselage opens up multiple options for hydrogen storage and distribution, and for cabin layout. It can hold up to 200 passengers.

According to Airbus, airports will require significant hydrogen transport and refueling infrastructure to meet the needs of day-to-day operations of these concept planes. “The transition to hydrogen as the primary power source for these concept planes will require decisive action from the entire aviation ecosystem,"" says its CEO, Guillaume Faury. ""Together with the support from government and industrial partners we can rise up to this challenge to scale-up renewable energy and hydrogen for the sustainable future of the aviation industry.”

HTM-Helicopters to become the first operator to use the new H145 for Offshore Wind operations - Airbus,"Fri, 18 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMC0wOS1odG0taGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtdG8tYmVjb21lLXRoZS1maXJzdC1vcGVyYXRvci10by11c2UtdGhlLW5ldy1oMTQ10gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Donauwörth, 18 September - Airbus Helicopters and HTM-Helicopters have signed a contract for the purchase of two additional H145 helicopters. HTM will be the first operator to use the new five-bladed H145 in the Offshore Wind segment.

“We thank HTM for their continued trust in Airbus Helicopters and our products”, says Thomas Hein, Head of Sales Western Europe at Airbus Helicopters. “Since HTM started offshore wind operations in 2008, they rely on H135 and H145 helicopters for their demanding operations.”

The delivery of the first helicopter, a four-bladed H145, is scheduled for the fourth quarter this year, while the second aircraft, a five-bladed H145 will be delivered mid next year. The four-bladed H145 will also later be upgraded with the new five-bladed rotor system by HTM’s maintenance organization.

The two new aircraft will be operated from HTM’s bases at Norden-Norddeich, Emden, Borkum and Helgoland. For their missions, which include passenger transport to and from wind farms and hoisting technicians to the wind-turbines, the two helicopters will be equipped with a powerful hoist, floatation equipment, and a cargo hook.

Powered by two Safran Arriel 2E engines, the H145 is equipped with full authority digital engine control (FADEC) and the Helionix digital avionics suite. It includes a high performance 4-axis autopilot, increasing safety and reducing pilot workload. Its particularly low acoustic footprint makes the H145 the quietest helicopter in its class.

The new upgrade of the H145 boasts several new features that will allow customers to enhance their operations: The innovative five-blade bearingless rotor increases the useful load by 150 kg, further enhancing the mission capabilities of the aircraft. This new rotor also improves crew and passenger comfort. Other advantages include a smaller D-value, allowing the H145 to operate in more confined areas, simplified maintenance, and an increased availability rate.

HTM Helicopters is one of the largest helicopter companies in Germany and employs around 150 people. Since April 2020, it has been fully owned by HERISTO Aktiengesellschaft. The core business of the HTM Group is the provisioning of helicopters for civil and military customers, offshore operations, emergency medical services, commercial air transport, flight training and aerial work which includes external load operations in mountainous terrain. The Intercopter GmbH is part of the HTM Group and a Part-145 approved maintenance organization.

Will The Proposed Airbus A220-500 Enter The Market This Decade? - Aviation Week,"Wed, 16 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L2FpcmNyYWZ0LXByb3B1bHNpb24vd2lsbC1wcm9wb3NlZC1haXJidXMtYTIyMC01MDAtZW50ZXItbWFya2V0LWRlY2FkZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ask the Editors: The Aviation Week Network invites our readers to submit questions to our editors and analysts. We’ll answer them, and if we can’t we’ll reach out to our wide network of experts for advice.

Do you think the proposed Airbus A220-500 will be the next 150-seat platform, and could it enter the market well before 2030?

Aviation Week Executive Editor, Commercial Aviation Jens Flottau responds:

The potential A220-500 would be a great strategic asset for Airbus in the long-standing competition with Boeing and the 737 MAX. Airbus has an opportunity to launch a state-of-the-art, 150-seat aircraft that would, by all expectations, be far more economical than its chief competitor, the Boeing 737-7. Airbus could then disregard the 100-150-seat segment in its considerations for a future new narrowbody, because it already has an A220 platform on which to build.

Airbus would likely make some updates to the -500, compared with the A220-300, beyond stretching the fuselage and equipping it with more powerful engines. The company could also look at improving commonality between the A220 and the A320neo family or bring in technologies that could play a role in a future new narrowbody.

The timing of a launch would depend on several factors. Airbus has all but ruled out any new aircraft developments except continuing work on the A321XLR for the short-to-medium term, given the devastating financial impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic. The company already has a major market share advantage vis-a-vis the 737 MAX, so there is no pressing need to move first.

Most observers expect Airbus to wait for Boeing to decide what its next new aircraft will look like—a move that might not be clear for several years—and then react in two ways. First, Airbus would build the A220-500 for the 150-seat market because it would be available years ahead of any new Boeing offering for that segment. Second, Airbus could then start a clean-sheet narrowbody at a larger baseline capacity of 180-200 seats.

The big unknown is how aircraft demand will change as air travel recovers post-COVID-19. One possible scenario is that airlines will move to operate smaller rather than larger units for several years if passenger demand does not justify as many large-capacity narrowbodies as in the past. If that were to become an established trend, Airbus could decide to take advantage of the situation and offer a relatively quick solution: the A220-500.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9990571141242981}",neutral,0.9990571141242981,0
Could stretch have saved Airbus A380? - AeroTime,"Sun, 20 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjU5MzYtYTM4MC1zdHJldGNoLXNhdmXSAT5odHRwczovL3d3dy5hZXJvdGltZS5hZXJvL2FydGljbGVzLzI1OTM2LWEzODAtc3RyZXRjaC1zYXZlL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It is more than likely that the days of the Airbus A380 are numbered. As international air travel remains largely in shambles, and with no short-term recovery in sight, airlines have put their A380s into long-term, or even worse, permanent storage. Even before the current crisis, however, its days were coming to an end, as no secondary market was on the horizon for ex-airline units.

Could a stretch, a re-engine or any other design changes have saved the Airbus A380?

Stretching a 72.7-meter giant

One of the first proposals that Airbus offered to airlines was a stretch of the original A380, dubbed the A380-900. Traces of the A380-900 can be found in documents from 2005, as the double-decker’s airport and maintenance planning documents mentioned that a stretch “could be developed when required by the market.”

The stretched variant could seat up to around 1,000 passengers in an all-economy configuration. Currently, the A380 has an exit limit of 868, according to its European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) issued type certificate.

In 2012, Bob Lange, the manufacturer’s Senior Vice President of Marketing, was quoted as saying that 2020 would be the appropriate time to launch the stretched A380. Increasing the length of the aircraft by 6.4 meters would have allowed airlines to seat more than 100 passengers more in a typical, three-class interior configuration. At Airbus Global Investor Forum in 2014, the company’s former Chief Executive Officer Fabrice Bregier stated that Airbus would “one day launch a stretch,” as it is very obvious that a stretch has “extra potential”. The chief executive also briefly mentioned a re-engined A380, the Airbus A380neo.

“We will one day launch a 380neo,” Bregier told investors in December 2014.

Airbus A380neo

A few months prior, in June 2014, the company’s Chief Operating Officer John Leahy confirmed that Airbus was studying an A380neo.

“When your largest customer is encouraging you to study it, we will continue to study it,” stated Leahy. However, the company did not commit to building it at the time. In December of the same year, reports alleged that the manufacturer was inching ever-closer to an initial agreement deal with Rolls-Royce to upgrade the engines on the Superjumbo. The British manufacturer was already one of the engine suppliers of the A380 program with the Trent 900 family of engines.

The largest customer that Leahy was referring to was, of course, Emirates. The Dubai-based airline’s president Tim Clark remarked that Emirates would have been very keen to upgrade to the neo, eventually replacing all of the airline’s planned 140-unit Airbus A380 fleet. According to Clark, the new engines would have consumed between 12 and 15% less fuel than the current engines, further improving the economics of the A380.

At Dubai Airshow 2015, Emirates’ executive was quoted as saying that the airline “would like them [Airbus – ed. note] to get on with,” the development of the A380neo.

“We’re sending a message that this airplane has scope although others in the industry don’t share that view,” added Clark.

Airbus A380plus

However, with the announcement of the A380plus on June 18, 2017, it seemed like Airbus gave up on the A380neo. The manufacturer presented the newest model of the double-decker in the form of a development study. Its main goal was to reduce operating costs as much as 13% compared to the original design of the A380, including the fact that new winglets would have provided with 4% fuel burn savings, indicated the planemaker.

“The A380plus is an efficient way to offer even better economics and improved operational performance at the same time,” commented Airbus’ COO John Leahy. The aircraft would be a new step to “best serve worldwide fast-growing traffic and the evolving needs of the A380 customers,” he continued.

“The A380 is well-proven as the solution to increasing congestion at large airports, and in offering a unique, passenger-preferred experience.”

Improved economics of the Superjumbo was not the only thing Airbus promised. The company also presented a new product onboard, called Cabin Enablers – a multitude of options would have increased the typical four-class configuration of 497 passengers to 575 passengers. Cabin Enablers consisted of New Forward Stairs (NFS, additional 20 seats), Combined Crew-Rest Compartment (CRRC, three extra Premium Economy (PE) seats), an 11-abreast layout in Economy (23 additional Economy seats), a new Aft-Galley Stair Module (AGSM, 14 more passengers and two extra food trolleys), the option to remove the upper-deck sidewall stowage for 10 extra Business class seats, and a nine-abreast layout of Premium Economy for 11 more PE passengers.

An increased Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW) would have provided an additional 300 nautical miles of range. Furthermore, increased maintenance check intervals, reduced six-year check downtime, and improved systems onboard would have reduced maintenance costs and increased aircraft availability, according to Airbus release announcing the A380plus.

A turning tide

As exciting these new versions of the double-decker were, they never saw the daylight. On February 14, 2019, Emirates and Airbus delivered the devastating news that broke many hearts on that year’s Valentine’s Day – the production of the A380 would stop in 2021. The Dubai-based airline reduced its backlog by 39 units. Having only 14 aircraft on order left and without any other interest in sight, Airbus canceled the program.

Signs of trouble at the A380 production line slipped through the lines a day before Bregier told that Airbus would stretch and slap on new engines on the double-decker. Chief Financial Officer Harald Wilhelm stated that the program could be axed as soon as 2018, as sales dried up. While from 2015 to 2017 the company was set to break-even on the program, Wilhelm added that 2018 would be a loss-making year for the A380 program.

In 2018, Airbus booked a €463 million ($548 million) charge related to the A380 program.

But other turning tides could point to the fact that neither a stretch, nor new engines could have saved the Airbus A380. The perfect example could be the Boeing 747-8, which entered the market four years after the Airbus double-decker. The latest and last iteration of the Queen of The Skies was the successor of the 747-400, a model which Boeing managed to sell just shy of 700 units. The 747-8, however, has booked only 195 orders, according to Boeing Order and Deliveries data. Only 57 units were delivered to passenger airlines, showcasing just how little demand there was for a 747 with new engines.

In some ways, acquiring the 747-8 made more sense than the A380. As it was a derivative of an older model, flight crew training was cheaper, there was a commonality between the -8 and the 747-400, reducing daily operating costs. Furthermore, improved operating costs achieved via new engines and aerodynamic improvements, more cargo, and passengers onboard resulting in extra revenue, including reduced maintenance intervals – the overall economic package of the Boeing 747 was improved. Yet very few bit the bullet to buy the newest iteration of Boeing’s original double-decker. As the manufacturer reported its Q2 2020 results, the company also announced that the production line of the 747 would push out its final unit in 2022, ending a 54-year run.

It could be pointed out that quad-engine aircraft did not make sense anymore. In Airbus’ own backyard, the four-engine A340 sat in the shadows of its more successful kin, the A350 and A330, as the manufacturer ended the production of the A340 in September 2011 with only 377 units delivered to airlines across 20 years of production.

But if we go back to Boeing’s backyard, the situation of the 777X might also indicate that the demand for large aircraft is shaky, at best. The 777X, which seats up to 426 passengers in a two-class configuration, attracted 350 orders from airlines since its inception in 2011. In comparison, the 747-8 seats 410 passengers in a three-class layout.

The folding-wingtip jet got its first order from Emirates in 2011. Meanwhile, between 2011 and 2020, the whole Boeing 787 family amassed 907 orders. Its most popular variant was the mid-sized 787-9 with 610 orders alone throughout nine years, outshining not only its family members, but the 777X as well.

And if the newest and largest twin-engine wide-body struggles to sell, how would a quad-engine giant fare, even with new engines?","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999401569366455}",neutral,0.9999401569366455,0
"Airbus set to deliver first Alabama-made A220 jetliner, marks five years in Mobile - Alabama Today","Tue, 15 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vYWx0b2RheS5jb20vYXJjaGl2ZXMvMzY1NjEtYWlyYnVzLXNldC10by1kZWxpdmVyLWZpcnN0LWFsYWJhbWEtbWFkZS1hMjIwLWpldGxpbmVyLW1hcmtzLWZpdmUteWVhcnMtaW4tbW9iaWxl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus SE is preparing to deliver its first U.S.-made A220 jetliner to Delta Air Lines Inc. as soon as this month, a milestone that comes as the airplane manufacturer marks five years in Alabama where it has had more than a $1 billion economic impact.

Since opening a plant in 2015 in Mobile, Airbus has used it to make more than 180 planes from its other narrow-body family – the A320 – for U.S. customers. Those aircraft have subsequently flown 60 million passengers 500 million miles, Airbus said.

“When we announced our intent to build A320 family aircraft in the United States, and to locate that facility in Mobile, Alabama, we also stated our intent to be a good neighbor, to create jobs and opportunities, and to help strengthen the U.S. aerospace industry,” Jeffrey Knittel, chief executive officer of Airbus Americas, said. “Five years later, we have become a major economic driver in creating an aerospace hub on the Gulf Coast.”

The Airbus U.S. Manufacturing Facility officially began producing its first aircraft, an A321 destined for JetBlue, on Sept. 14, 2015.

Since then, the Airbus production team has:

Directly employed more than 1,000 people (90% who currently live in Mobile or Baldwin County; 26% being military veterans; representing 29 nationalities).

Announced and opened a second assembly line for A220 aircraft (doubling the size of its footprint at Brookley Field).

Supported more than 40 local charitable and community organizations through money, time and donations.

“The achievements of the Airbus U.S. Manufacturing team over these past five years are just the beginning,” Knittel said. “We are proud to call Mobile our American aircraft manufacturing home, and we look forward to many more years of partnership with the community, our customers and suppliers.”

Doubling down on the Alabama site with a new assembly line building A220s, an advanced Canadian-designed jet, enables Airbus to avoid U.S.-imposed tariffs for the planes it delivers to American carriers. As trade tensions flare and a long-running dispute nears its resolution in the World Trade Organization, the U.S. outpost shores up the global reach of the world’s largest planemaker and its growing presence on Boeing Co.’s home turf.

“Mobile will not be affected relative to the WTO strategy,” Knittel told Bloomberg. “As a matter of fact, Mobile has proven the logic of a broad-based industrial footprint.”

Over the coming weeks, a panel of three WTO arbiters will determine whether the European Union can retaliate against the U.S. for any illegal subsidies provided to Boeing. The trade body has already awarded $7.5 billion to the U.S. in a parallel dispute about European subsidies to Airbus. The latest ruling could spur the two sides to settle their 15-year-old trade battle.

International expansion

While Boeing confines its jet assembly to the U.S., Toulouse, France-based Airbus has extended its industrial footprint into key international markets. It produces A320 aircraft in four countries: Germany, France, China and the U.S. The A220, which Airbus acquired from struggling Bombardier Inc., is made in Quebec and Mobile.

Airbus’s expansion anticipated a “new phase in globalization,” marked by increasingly nationalistic policies and trade restrictions, said aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia. “That’s the big picture, one that requires a greater in-country presence. It’s no longer taking open borders for granted.”

The strategy has its downsides. With its facilities spread out in different countries, Airbus wasn’t able to move as quickly as Boeing to pare output and costs after the coronavirus pandemic caused demand for new jetliners to plunge. In Mobile, Airbus is pausing plans to speed up A320 production as it cuts global output for the jetliner family to 40 planes a month, Knittel said.

Delta has taken only three of the 17 of the smaller A220-100 jets it was originally scheduled to receive this year, and its plans for the Mobile-made A220-300 models aren’t clear. The carrier has been working with Airbus to minimize deliveries over the next 18 to 24 months, Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian said in July.

Still, to avoid larger-scale layoffs in its U.S. operations, Airbus plans to shift some employees from A320 production to the A220 line, where work is still ramping up, Knittel said. Airbus plans to build four A220 a month in Mobile by mid-decade, which would double its current output.

“We’re working through the issues. We’ve basically flattened the production rate,” Knittel said of the Mobile site’s response to the market turmoil. “We’re hopeful that in the future things will pick back up, but we have to prepare for the climate we’re in.”

Airbus said its newly expanded delivery center in Mobile will be named after one of the company’s former leaders, Tom Enders. Enders supported and drove the establishment of an Airbus aircraft production facility in the U.S. during his tenure as CEO of Airbus. A dedication ceremony will be held in the coming months.

On this fifth anniversary of production in Alabama, the University of South Alabama Center for Real Estate and Economic Development reported that Airbus has had a $1.1 billion economic impact in Mobile and Baldwin counties these first five years, supporting more than 12,000 jobs through construction and payroll alone. When extended to the state of Alabama, the impact was $1.2 billion and more than 15,000 jobs.

Sad: The Final Airbus A380 Has Been Assembled - One Mile at a Time,"Thu, 24 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL2ZpbmFsLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLWFzc2VtYmxlZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This week marks another milestone for the plane that never really reached its full potential…

Airbus completes assembly of the final A380

Yesterday the final Airbus A380 to ever be produced rolled out from the final assembly line in Toulouse, France. Airbus held a special event for employees to commemorate this milestone, which was attended by Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury.

The final A380 has the manufacturer serial number (MSN) 272, so that’s how many A380s have been produced since production started in 2005.

Ceremony to commemorate the final A380

There are still a total of nine outstanding Airbus A380 deliveries, with eight of the whales going to Emirates (for a total of 122 A380s), and one plane going to All Nippon Airways (for a total of three A380s).

Understandably airlines are trying to defer delivery of these planes as long as possible given that they have no need for them, so only time will tell when these planes are actually flying with paying passengers.

We knew this day would come…

For so long the A380 seemed like the future of air travel. Before the pandemic, the number of people traveling annually continued to climb, so with airports becoming increasingly congested, you’d think larger planes would also represent the future.

Unfortunately that’s not how it worked out, though. Airlines prefer planes like the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787, which are smaller and long range, while still being fuel efficient. This allows airlines to profitably operate point-to-point routes, which the A380 could only do in a limited number of markets.

Emirates was the only airline that fully embraced the A380, and the airline operated nearly as many A380s as all other airlines combined.

We officially learned that A380 production would end in early 2019. The future of the A380 came down to Emirates, and the Dubai-based airline realized it didn’t make sense to singlehandedly keep the plane “alive” forever.

Emirates has embraced the A380 more than any other airline

How much longer will the A380 fly?

While this marks the end of A380 production, we can still expect the plane to be flying for many years to come. Well, or at least that was the plan before the pandemic.

Since the pandemic started, Air France has retired its entire A380 fleet, and Lufthansa will retire its entire A380 fleet unless there’s an “unexpectedly rapid market recovery.”

Before the pandemic Emirates indicated it would fly A380s through the mid-2030s. The A380 has been flying passengers for about 13 years, so hopefully it’ll be flying for at least 13 more…

Lufthansa plans to retire its A380 fleet

Bottom line

There’s a lot to be sad about in the airline industry during the pandemic, from aircraft retirements to layoffs. This particular A380 development doesn’t come as a surprise, as we knew A380 production would end even before the pandemic.

I totally get why A380 production is being discontinued, and why airlines are opting for smaller planes, that are easier to fly more profitably. Still, as the world population continues to grow, and as travel hopefully (eventually) recovers, one has to wonder if we’ll ever see a 500+ person plane produced again.

Understandably there are other focuses, and this week we’ve even seen Airbus unveil prototypes for zero-emission aircraft, which could be flying by 2035.

Airbus debuts hydrogen net-zero concept aircraft for 2035 launch - Electrek,"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vZWxlY3RyZWsuY28vMjAyMC8wOS8yMS9haXJidXMtaHlkcm9nZW4tbmV0LXplcm8tY29uY2VwdC1haXJjcmFmdC0yMDM1L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Image courtesy Airbus.

Airbus has revealed three concepts for the world’s first emissions-free commercial aircraft that could enter service by 2035 — and all would run on hydrogen. Each concept explores different technology pathways and aerodynamic configurations to achieve net zero.

The Toulouse, France-headquartered company’s three aircraft concepts are all codenamed “ZEROe.” The three concepts are:

Upper left in photo: A turbofan design (120-200 passengers) with a range of 2,000+ nautical miles, capable of operating transcontinentally and powered by a modified gas-turbine engine running on hydrogen, rather than jet fuel, through combustion. The liquid hydrogen will be stored and distributed via tanks located behind the rear pressure bulkhead. Bottom center in photo: A turboprop design (up to 100 passengers) using a turboprop engine instead of a turbofan and also powered by hydrogen combustion in modified gas-turbine engines, which would be capable of traveling more than 1,000 nautical miles, making it a perfect option for short-haul trips. Upper right in photo: A “blended-wing body” design (up to 200 passengers) concept in which the wings merge with the main body of the aircraft with a range similar to that of the turbofan concept. The exceptionally wide fuselage opens up multiple options for hydrogen storage and distribution, and for cabin layout.

Airports would require significant hydrogen transport and refueling infrastructure to meet day-to-day operations needs. Governmental support would be required to meet these ambitious objectives with increased funding for research and technology, digitalization, and mechanisms that encourage the use of sustainable fuels and the renewal of aircraft fleets to allow airlines to retire older aircraft earlier.

Guillaume Faury, Airbus CEO, said:

These concepts will help us explore and mature the design and layout of the world’s first climate-neutral, zero-emission commercial aircraft, which we aim to put into service by 2035. The transition to hydrogen, as the primary power source for these concept planes, will require decisive action from the entire aviation ecosystem. Together with the support from government and industrial partners we can rise up to this challenge to scale up renewable energy and hydrogen for the sustainable future of the aviation industry.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999566078186035}",neutral,0.9999566078186035,0
