Virtual reality with real benefits - Airbus,"Mon, 25 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE3LTA5LXZpcnR1YWwtcmVhbGl0eS13aXRoLXJlYWwtYmVuZWZpdHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As a company, there are few things more exciting than technologies with the power to completely transform how we work. Some of the most promising and impactful innovations can be found with virtual, augmented and mixed reality (VR, AR and MR). Our Airbus Holographic Academies are now taking these technologies to the next level through prototyping and implementation of the most encouraging ideas.

AR, VR and MR technologies have been well known at Airbus for years: heads-up displays support pilots during certain flight phases and we have already designed and deployed VR software tools throughout the aircraft design process. Taking advantage of CAD data, engineers can use VR to see, interact with and adjust 3D digital models, before the parts are actually made. The value it brings is significant: we can simulate and reproduce situations in a safe, normalised environment that would otherwise be costly, complex or even dangerous.

On the digital shop floor, augmented reality can project data, information and design details to help with construction and inspection processes. Since 2011, our engineers and operators have used a hand-held device that displays a 3D model on top of the real aircraft, providing valuable insight into size and positioning. Sensors track the environment and user movements and send video feeds to view the digital and physical structure combined.

This approach can be a major time-saver. The inspection time of 60,000 brackets used on an Airbus A380 fuselage, for instance, has dropped from three weeks to just three days.

In the last decade, VR and AR technologies have become more mobile, affordable and easy to use than ever, freeing up potential to completely transform many areas. To harness this potential, the Holographic Academies are paving the way for global adoption and innovation programmes, with more than 250 different use cases identified to date across the company.

For example, VR is transforming how people interact with our data. Very soon, any Airbus employee will be able to access digital aircraft data and use a Rift or Vive headset to pull out a 3D digital model and view it from any angle to quickly review space accessibility, maintenance processes or simply test a new design.

Thanks to the Microsoft HoloLens augmented reality glasses, our electrical teams can view the different parts of a virtual harness cable superimposed on top of the actual aircraft. This hands-free guidance makes things quicker, easier and more comfortable for operators, enabling a 25% quicker installation.

And the possibilities extend much wider: our marketing team is currently testing a holographic application combining a physical and virtual cabin to configure and customise cabin space in real time. Internally, our HR team is using AR to introduce new employees to the company in a more immersive and engaging way. We can also better share information in training sessions by delivering complex technical lessons to a group through interactive, shared 3D, or even provide training via holographic coach.

The Airbus Holographic Academies are forming strategic partnerships to gain access to pre-market virtual, augmented and mixed reality technologies. Our HoloLens cooperation with Microsoft, including the Microsoft Mixed Reality Partner Program, allows us to better understand the technology’s capabilities and leverage its vast potential.

This combination of technologies is mapping out an exciting journey. Because of their wide-ranging potential, we are focusing on implementation enablers to make them a standard tool for employees across the company.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9979797005653381}",positive,0.9979797005653381,1

European plane-maker Airbus announced this week that 1,500 of its airplanes were now in service for U.S. and Canadian airlines. The milestone was celebrated at the company's Mobile, Ala., assembly line with a brand new American Airlines A321 jet.

Airbus first entered the U.S. market in 1977 with Eastern Airlines. Then a relative upstart competing against American manufacturers Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, Airbus loaned four A300 jets to Eastern, betting that they'd perform so well that the airline would place an order.

The bet paid off, and Eastern ordered 23 of the airplanes, impressed with their economics.

Airbus Installs 3D Printed Titanium Aircraft Production Part - SME.org,"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNtZS5vcmcvYWlyYnVzLWluc3RhbGxzLTNkLXByaW50ZWQtdGl0YW5pdW0tYWlyY3JhZnQtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1wYXJ00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Arconic and Airbus have achieved a 3D printing first with the installation of a 3D printed titanium bracket, shown here, onto a series production Airbus commercial aircraft, the A350 XWB. (Photo courtesy Business Wire)

Airbus has achieved a 3D printing first with the installation of a 3D printed titanium bracket on a series production commercial aircraft. Manufactured by Arconic, a global technology, engineering, and advanced manufacturing company, the 3D printed titanium bracket was installed on a series production Airbus commercial aircraft, the A350 XWB. Arconic is 3D printing these parts for Airbus’s newest wide-body aircraft at Arconic’s additive manufacturing facility in Austin, Texas. “Arconic is proud to partner with Airbus to advance aerospace additive manufacturing,” said Jeremy Halford, president of Arconic Titanium and Engineered Products. “Our comprehensive capabilities, from materials science leadership to qualification expertise, helped make this achievement possible. We look forward to continuing to advance the art of the possible in additive for aerospace.”

This first installation of a 3D printed titanium part on a series production Airbus commercial aircraft marks a milestone for additive manufacturing in aerospace. While airplane makers have been using 3D printed parts for quite some time, largely for components inside the cabin, equipping airframes with metal parts produced via additive manufacturing is new. In addition, Airbus’s installation of this 3D printed titanium bracket on a series production commercial airplane, as opposed to a test airplane, marks a significant step forward in the qualification of more complex 3D printed parts for production aircraft. 3D printed parts, including metal printed cabin brackets and bleed pipes, are already flying on Airbus A320neo and A350 XWB test aircraft. This 3D printed titanium bracket is part of an ongoing partnership between Airbus and Arconic. Last year, Arconic announced three agreements with Airbus to produce titanium and nickel 3D printed parts for commercial aircraft, including the A320 platform and A350 XWB. These agreements draw on Arconic’s cutting-edge 3D printing technology capabilities, including laser powder bed and electron beam processes.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9835725426673889}",neutral,0.9835725426673889,0
Airbus looks to China for A380 jumbo amid sluggish global sales - Yahoo Finance,"Tue, 19 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9haXJidXMtZXllcy1jaGluYS1hMzgwLWp1bWJvLTEwMDQxNDQ2OS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Brenda Goh

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese airlines could need between 60 and 100 Airbus A380 jets over the next five or so years as passenger traffic grows, the plane maker's China head said on Tuesday, amid rising questions over future demand for the super jumbo.

Strong demand in China - if translated into orders - would be a major boost for the A380, the world's biggest jetliner, which has faced sluggish demand as airlines shift focus towards a generation of nimbler, more fuel-efficient long-haul planes such as the A350 and rival Boeing Co's 787.

China is the world's fastest growing aviation market and is a key battleground for Airbus as well as Boeing which recently predicted the country would spend over $1 trillion on planes over the next 20 years.

""When I look at the market flow, the passenger flow, route by route and the economics, I'm fully confident that the Chinese carriers will need a minimum of 60 A380s over the next 5 to 7 years,"" Airbus China Head Eric Chen said at an event in Beijing.

Airbus has sold five A380s to China Southern Airlines Co Ltd but has otherwise failed to penetrate the market with the double-decker jet despite its robust demand forecasts.

The aircraft manufacturer believes the A380 will come into its own in markets that face booming tourism and congestion like China, but the aircraft has struggled to compete with smaller and more flexible twin-engined models.

In July, Airbus signed an agreement to sell 140 A320 and A350 planes to China in a deal worth almost $23 billion. China represents around 22 percent of Airbus global deliveries.

""What I can say is that if one airline takes the lead to order a large number of A380s, the others will follow. I would expect a domino effect and I'm working on it to produce that domino effect that has not happened yet,"" Chen said.

He admitted though that it would not necessarily be an easy task to win over Chinese buyers.

""A lack of confidence to operate the A380, that is something to work on continuously with the airlines in China,"" he said.

Story continues

Europe's largest aerospace company will on Wednesday inaugurate a completion and delivery centre for its A330 jet in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin. The facility is Airbus' first for wide-body aircraft outside Europe and is expected to deliver its first A330 aircraft this year.

Francois Mery, chief operating officer at Airbus China, said that there was talk of placing more higher-value work in China, as the company has set a target of doubling its industrial cooperation activity in the country to $1 billion by 2020.

""It's not only about the figure, it also about the content,"" he said.

""They have the ambition of getting into the business, making their own aircraft, they need to develop all kinds of things. And so without being naive, of course we are working with them.""

Airbus' comments came as the Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd (COMAC), which is leading China's efforts to become a key player in the global civil aerospace market, on Tuesday announced 130 in orders for its C919 jet.

Airbus has inaugurated its A330 Completion and Delivery Centre (C&DC) in Tianjin, China, taking additional steps in the expansion of its global footprint and strategic partnership with China. At the same time, the first A330 to be delivered from the C&DC was handed over to Tianjin Airlines.

Located at the same site as the Airbus Tianjin A320 Family Final Assembly Line and the Airbus Tianjin Delivery Centre, the A330 C&DC covers the aircraft completion activities including cabin installation, aircraft painting and production flight test, as well as customer flight acceptance and aircraft delivery. Some 150 Chinese staff members of the C&DC were trained by Airbus experts in Toulouse.

The new plant is composed of paint shop, weighing hangar and one main hangar with three aircraft positions covering an area of 16,800m2.The A330 C&DC in Tianjin will employ more than 250 people and is ready to deliver two aircraft per month by early 2019.

“The inauguration of our A330 C&DC in Tianjin, together with the first of many deliveries, marks a new milestone for Airbus’ international footprint and underlines the strong spirit of cooperation with our Chinese partners,” said Fabrice Brégier, Airbus COO and President of Commercial Aircraft. “Wide-body aircraft completed in China is an Airbus and an industry first which demonstrates our mutual commitment to a strong and growing Chinese aviation sector.”

To celebrate C&DC inauguration, a first A330 aircraft was delivered to Tianjin Airlines. The aircraft which was assembled and equipped in Toulouse with Chinese and European staff is powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engines and is configured in two classes with 260 seats.

By the end of August 2017, the in-service Airbus fleet with Chinese carrier included 1,484 aircraft, 1,282 A320 Family and 202 A330 Family. The A330 is the most popular wide-body aircraft in China operated by nine airlines.

The A330 is one of the world’s most efficient and versatile widebody aircraft with best in class operating economics. To date the A330 Family has attracted nearly 1,700 orders and over 1,300 A330 Family aircraft are currently flying with more than 110 operators worldwide. With an operational reliability of 99.5 percent and various product enhancements the A330 Family is the most cost-efficient and capable widebody aircraft to date.

Airbus is a global leader in aeronautics, space and related services. In 2016 it generated revenues of €67 billion and employed a workforce of around 134,000. Airbus offers the most comprehensive range of passenger airliners from 100 to more than 600 seats. Airbus is also a European leader providing tanker, combat, transport and mission aircraft, as well as one of the world’s leading space companies. In helicopters, Airbus provides the most efficient civil and military rotorcraft solutions worldwide.

United Airlines has increased the number of A350 XWB aircraft it will bring into its fleet, updating and expanding its previously existing order for 35 A350-1000 to 45 A350-900 widebody aircraft to replace older, less efficient aircraft, supporting future growth at the airline.

The A350-900 is the cornerstone member of the A350XWB (Xtra Wide-Body) family, which is shaping the future of air travel. The aircraft typically seats 325 passengers in a standard three-class configuration and features state-of-the-art comfort and amenities, offering an exclusive flight experience to passengers on board with the new Airspace by Airbus cabin. The A350-900’s unique combination of payload and true long-range range capabilities makes it an ideal aircraft for United Airlines’ international route system. These aircraft will be the first Airbus widebodies to join United’s global fleet.

“For the past year, United has done a complete review to ensure that we have the right long-term fleet strategy, and it was clear that the A350 aligns with our replacement needs and our network,” said Andrew Levy, Chief Financial Officer of United Airlines. “The combination of the range performance and efficiencies make the A350 an attractive aircraft for United.”

“This updated and expanded order is a strong reaffirmation of the A350 XWB Family,” said John Leahy, Chief Operating Officer – Customers. “United and Airbus have had a long and strong partnership for many years, and we’ve worked together to ensure their requirements for the future are met, if not exceeded. The airline’s decision to grow its widebody fleet with, for the first time, a widebody model from Airbus, shows they know that the A350 will meet their financial and performance demands, while pleasing their customers who will enjoy the quietest and most comfortable cabin in its class.”

The A350 XWB is the world’s newest and most efficient twin-aisle airliner, featuring the latest aerodynamic design, carbon fiber fuselage and wings, plus new fuel-efficient Rolls-Royce engines. Together, these latest technologies translate into unrivalled levels of operational efficiency, with a 25 percent reduction in fuel burn and emissions, and significantly lower maintenance costs.

Talk to me - Airbus,"Sun, 24 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE3LTA5LXRhbGstdG8tbWXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Enabled by major advances in natural language processing and natural language understanding, chatbot launches are exploding. As tech companies open up their messaging platforms to developers, the growth of these sophisticated, unmanned algorithms that can ‘talk’ to users has been massive: three months after Facebook announced its platform for building bots, Facebook Messenger had more than 11,000 bots.

Their potential is vast. But Ronny Fehling, who heads initiatives in artificial intelligence and cognitive computing at Airbus, is quick to urge caution. A chatbot must answer a couple of classic tests, he says. First, is it better, cheaper or faster? If not, then intelligent search via a website or app is often a better option. Second, does the chatbot try to replace tasks that people love doing or hate doing?”

In the simplest terms, chatbots are artificial intelligence-based applications that automate processes, he says. At Airbus, chatbots are seen as a part of robotic process automation. “They should strive to automate processes in a business-to-human interaction context and aim to replace those repetitive tasks that people hate doing.”

For Airbus, the value in chatbots is their ability to use machine learning to deliver domain knowledge. “The chatbot needs to be trained on three things: domain classification; data content, i.e. the information you actually want to search for; and interaction models.”

Currently, however, most chatbots are not successful, Fehling says. “We are definitely in a hype cycle, but there are a couple of cases where chatbots really make sense: when you have long conversations, a lot of frustrating back and forth, typically over email, between humans. Or in HR, for instance, where lots of people ask the same or similar questions.”

24/7 support

Simple frequently asked questions are a great place to look to develop chatbots. “For example, our support engineers typically have to ask a lot of questions before they can provide an answer,” Fehling explains. “But a chatbot could have a fully-fledged conversation and prepare an answer that the engineer can verify. If it is correct, we reduce the cognitive workload for our support engineers and the time to closure for the support ticket.”

This would be useful when a plane engineer needs out-of-hours support from Airbus. Head of R&T at Airbus Customer Services Laurent Pouget is currently working on a project to do just that. “While it may not provide a verified answer, a chatbot system could react immediately and help cover a lot of ground. They could really help us improve our support,” he says.[GP1]

Chatbot in the cockpit

Airbus Research & Innovation Chief Jean Jacques Toumazet is also involved in a chatbot project, one that could lead to the introduction of a virtual assistant in the cockpit to assist pilots in resolving complex situation management issues.

“Perhaps you need to divert to another airport and you have 250 passengers on board,” he says. “Does this airport have the correct hotel capacity? Maybe the best trade-off is to divert to another airport that can accommodate all the passengers.”

Toumazet also envisages a chatbot or virtual assistant that can anticipate problems before they arise. “We are looking at how to predict whether the pilot might make a hard landing – when the aircraft touches down at high speed with more force than normal. This is not really based on interaction, like a chatbot, but a machine learning system that can understand what is going on and then warn you without waiting for you to ask a question.”

Considering sustainability

On the ground, Michael Sillus, who works on innovations at Airbus in Hamburg, is developing a chatbot for the shop floor that will help with technical questions as part of Airbus’ vision of a factory of the future. “We could have a bot to help find the right answer to de-block a manufacturing situation, for example; a first-line, design organisation support inside the factory.”

He also points to a chatbot currently underway that will help project managers consider sustainable development goals as laid out by the UN. “As an initial proof of concept, we are building an ecoDESIGN BOT. It will be integrated into a framework of other bots to help project managers ask the right questions and provide data to support the correct decisions, thus avoiding expensive and time-consuming life cycle assessments afterward.”

Giving value to data

For Laurent Pouget, the long-term goal is to develop a system that can create chatbots across the company. “The rise of chatbots will change how we work, communicate and access knowledge. Today, nearly everything is digitised, but it is a black hole; we can’t take advantage of it because there is too much information and it is difficult to handle. The chatbots will be able to give value to what is digitised.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9987902045249939}",neutral,0.9987902045249939,0

The company delivered its first North American-operated aircraft to U.S.-based Eastern Airlines in 1977 and has gone on to tally more than 2,000 orders with 25 airline companies and lessors in the region.

A celebration was held at the Airbus U.S. Manufacturing Facility in Mobile, AL, with delivery teams from American Airlines and Airbus marking the milestone.

Paul Oliver, Vice President-Customer Services for Airbus Americas, praised the teamwork of both Airbus and American citing their commitment to hard work in advancing the future of airline transportation. “This milestone showcases the continued growth of commercial aviation in North America – and our four decades of commitment to providing the right aircraft at the right time with benchmark customer support for our customers. We’re proud to recognize this milestone with our partners at American Airlines, and it’s gratifying for it to happen with an aircraft built in the U.S.”

American Airlines operates more Airbus passenger aircraft than any other airline in the world. Since the first delivery of 25 Airbus aircraft to American in 1988 and 1989, the relationship between both companies has grown, with American now flying 416 Airbus aircraft in their fleet, with another 122 on order.

Joe Maloy, Director of Fleet Acquisitions, Dispositions and Records for American Airlines was in Mobile to accept the aircraft. “As the world’s largest operator of Airbus aircraft, American Airlines is proud to accept the 1500th in-service Airbus aircraft in North America, and that the aircraft was built at the state-of-the-art manufacturing site in Mobile, Alabama. American greatly values our relationship with Airbus. Congratulations to Airbus for reaching this milestone!” he said.

Airbus increases footprint in China with new aeroplane completion plant - World Finance,"Wed, 20 Sep 2017 11:16:17 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndvcmxkZmluYW5jZS5jb20vbWFya2V0cy9haXJidXMtaW5jcmVhc2VzLWZvb3RwcmludC1pbi1jaGluYS13aXRoLW5ldy1hZXJvcGxhbmUtY29tcGxldGlvbi1wbGFudNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The first Airbus A330 plane was delivered to China at the opening of the company's original completion centre in Tianjin

On September 20, European aircraft manufacturer Airbus opened a completion plant in China, with the aim of meeting surging demand in the world’s fastest-growing aviation market.

The opening comes at a time when increasing passenger numbers are boosting business. Looking ahead, China is expected to spend over $1trn on aeroplanes over the next two decades, Reuters reported.

With this projected growth in mind, Airbus is increasing its footprint in the country with hopes to turn favourable forecasts into profitable orders. Until now, Airbus’ presence in China has been limited to a final assembly line for A320 jets, operating since 2008 in Tianjin, in the north of the country.

The new plant, also located in Tianjin, will focus on the company’s A330, a profitable wide-body jet, the demand for which has slowed in recent years amid an upward trend for more agile planes. Now, Airbus estimates that airlines’ demand for large planes could reach 60 to 100 over the next five years.

Airbus is increasing its footprint in the country with hopes to turn favourable forecasts into profitable orders

The strategic move is a joint venture with two Chinese companies – the Aviation Industry Corporation of China and Tianjin Free Trade Zone Investment Company – and is the materialisation of an agreement first made in 2014, when President Xi Jinping visited France, home to Airbus’ headquarters.

As with operations worldwide, the European aerospace firm will also face competition from Boeing in China. The US rival plans to build a 737 completion plant to increase its presence in the China, in partnership with Commercial Aircraft Corp of China.

The market seems to have room for both. According to the International Air Transport Association, there will be a sharp growth in Chinese air travel in the next 20 years, with passenger numbers reaching a record 1.3 billion, from 817 million in 2016.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9974299073219299}",positive,0.9974299073219299,1

Sponsored by the European Union, the the project is examining the commercial feasibility of using a laminar wing. For the Breakthrough Laminar Aircraft Demonstrator in Europe, Airbus is once again putting A340 MSN 001 into service.

How to Track the BLADE

Follow A340 MSN 001 with registration F-WWAI. The aircraft is expected to conduct 150 hours of flight tests as part of the BLADE program.

The BLADE’s First Flight

The aircraft, now dubbed ‘Flight Lab’, is the first test aircraft in the world combining a transonic laminar wing profile with a standard aircraft internal primary structure. The goal of the tests are to bring a 50% reduction of wing friction and through that reduction in friction a decrease in CO 2 emissions of up to five percent.

Speaking of today’s first flight, Airbus Flight-Test Engineer, Philippe Seve said, “We began by opening the flight envelope to check that the aircraft was handling correctly. We achieved our objective to fly at the design Mach number, at a reasonable altitude and check everything was fine. We also checked that the FTI was working as expected, to identify further fine-tuning for the next flights.”

Over 16 months of work at Tarbes, the aircraft was fitted with two representative transonic laminar outer-wings and a host of test instrumentation inside the fuselage. Airbus has also installed hundreds of sensors on the wing to measure the waviness of the surface. These instruments will help engineers determine ithe waviness’ influence on the laminarity. Airbus has also installed infrared cameras on the fin pod of the A340 to measure wing temperature.

Other Use as a Testbed

Among other missions A340 MSN 001 has performed, the aircraft served as a flying test bed for the Rolls Royce Trent 900 engine, which powers the A380.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999815225601196}",neutral,0.9999815225601196,0

Airspace by Airbus - Aircraft Interiors International,"Wed, 06 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmNyYWZ0aW50ZXJpb3JzaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvYWlyc3BhY2UtYnktYWlyYnVzLTMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aviation enthusiasts aside, do the flying public really notice or appreciate which aircraft type they are traveling in? According to Airbus research, they do. As an example, over a two-year period Airbus used in-house metrics and sites such as Routehappy and TripAdvisor to measure the sentiment of passengers who had taken a flight in an A380, and found that when the A380 is associated with an airline, that aircraft generates a better brand sentiment with passengers than the airline’s name alone.

This finding that aircraft type can be important to airline brand perception has led Airbus to create a new brand of its own: Airspace by Airbus, which will fly on the A330neo in late 2017 with launch customer TAP Portugal. By offering strong, consistent and recognizable cabin characteristics that passengers appreciate – such as the minimum 18in seat width in economy – Airbus hopes that passengers will actively seek out flights with Airspace cabins, favoring airlines that fly them.

“Airspace is a tool that helps airlines better face the challenge of social media,” explains Kiran Rao, Airbus’s EVP of marketing and strategy. “When passengers book flights they look at social media to compare airlines, seats and experience, and that is driving change. In the past we created a great product and enabled airlines to customize it as they wanted, but today we’re reaching out to passengers because they make big decisions based on product and experience. So we’ve listened to our customers and our customers’ customers.”

Crossing branding lines?

The question is, isn’t ensuring the happiness of customers’ customers the job of the, well, customers? After all, airlines will surely be more concerned about immersing passengers in their own onboard brand experience, rather than the Airbus brand.

“We’ve had this debate with airlines,” responds Rao. “Think about an apartment. If the rooms are wrongly proportioned, the floors are of low quality, the windows are badly positioned and the lighting is poorly placed, then even if you bring in the best furniture in the world, the apartment will still be poorly designed. Airspace offers [the aircraft equivalent of] a luxurious apartment for you to bring in your own furniture and make it fantastic. We are not interfering with airlines’ branding; we are actually providing a way to enhance it.”

(Jana) white space

The key is that an Airspace cabin is a blank canvas, finished in floor-to-floor white, a shade named Jana white that was introduced in the A350 and designed by Airbus to work well with LED light of any color (16.7 million variations are available). Airbus first experimented with this ‘any color as long as it’s white’ concept with the A350, about which François Caudron, SVP of marketing, says Airbus “didn’t get a single negative message”.

“The key customization feature for airlines remains the seat and all its attributes, its features, the trim and finish, the custom carpets, the features in the galleys, and the decoration on monuments,” explains Caudron. “What is being offered is the framework. It is white for everyone and they paint the cabin with light. Airlines love it, as they can project the exact ambience they wish by programming the system. We didn’t get any messages about Airspace being too restrictive when we disclosed it to customers.”

Perhaps the biggest fan of the commonality of Airspace cabins will be leasing companies, which, according to Caudron, account for 48% of Airbus aircraft orders. If a leasing company is placing an aircraft with a new operator, the work required to convert the cabins to the new carrier’s interior choices will be minimal.

“For lessors, having an Airspace cabin guarantees strong residual values for the aircraft,” states Caudron. “High residual values are good for airlines as well – it means they are investing in the right product. That’s what Airspace is bringing to the community.”

Many airlines will be happy with this approach, but there are a few carriers for whom a standard cabin could be considered anathema, a prime example being Etihad. We posed the question of how the customization demands of an airline like Etihad could be met with Airspace to Paul Edwards, head of industrial design at Airbus: “It’s always a balance between delivery of aircraft, cost of aircraft, and how much they are able to customize. It would become an individual definition discussion between them and Airbus about what is achievable, how long it would take and where the costs lie.”

Something that all airlines will like is the space efficiency of the A330neo cabin, which in the same footprint as the A330ceo can accommodate an additional 10-14 passengers without the cabins feeling more cramped. Features such as space-efficient lavs have enabled Airbus to carve out this extra space, and a new overhead stowage bin design with a claimed 66% extra capacity means there is also more than enough room for the additional baggage.

As Rao states, “We are using the space more wisely and efficiently. The Airspace concept actually gives passengers a greater feeling of space and a better experience through the design language and design concepts.”

Space language

When Airbus first had the notion of creating the Airspace brand, it began an intensive design research process. Studies were carried out from a passenger point of view, information gathered from social media, and customer focus teams that consulted key members of airlines about products, pain points, what is important to them, and what they thought would be important in the future.

A 40-strong design team at Airbus’s Hamburg and Toulouse centers then used this research to develop the Airspace cabin concept, including trim and finish designers, lighting designers, product designers and a few engineers. An unnamed design agency was also brought in to give an external perspective on the project.

“We wanted to create a clear and defined design language about how we design the cabin, with straight parallel lines, continuous split lines, continuous surfaces, and using lighting to make elements like the bins ‘float’,” explains Edwards.

“Our design language is built on our European heritage. We have a really classical, contemporary and simple approach, with simple, straight lines. We do make shapes curvaceous where needed though – for example, flat sidewall panels would look great, but they are curved to give every possible millimeter to the passenger.

“We’re trying to create something really timeless, something that lasts. But it’s not just about creating a style, because if you create a style then it dates, and that’s something airlines don’t like. It’s about leveraging our European heritage of classic, simple versatile design. Everything we do is for a reason; it’s a balance of the visual, the aesthetic and the functional. Nothing is there as a superfluous piece of beautification. It all goes back to us creating a backdrop for the airline branding.”

The future

The Airspace cabin design you see in these pages is largely what appears in TAP Portugal’s first A330neo. However, that is just the beginning, with Airbus’s plan being to progressively roll Airspace out across the complete product family, with the initial focus being on wide-body models.

As Rao explains, “If you look at the A320 and A380, they are individual products with individual features, but as we work through the Airbus family, they will all become Airspace aircraft.”

Looking further ahead, Airspace will evolve to reflect new technologies and trends. Airspace is a brand, not a set of rules, so as new technologies such as ‘bionic’ 3D printing – as shown in Airbus’s recent ‘bionic partition’ concept – become relevant, they can be applied in the cabin.

“The response we’ve received so far from airlines is very positive,” concludes Caudron. “They say it’s great that Airbus is investing money in where airlines make their money – the cabin. They say it’s great to see Airbus backing innovation and harmonizing cabin product across different aircraft. That is really being perceived very positively.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8901810050010681}",neutral,0.8901810050010681,0

JetBlue to launch Airbus Airspace cabin for A320 family - Runway Girl Network,"Tue, 26 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTcvMDkvamV0Ymx1ZS10by1sYXVuY2gtYWlyYnVzLWFpcnNwYWNlLWNhYmluLWZvci1hMzIwLWZhbWlseS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONG BEACH — Airbus is aiming for the Americas market with its new Airspace cabin for the A320 family as it unveils a detailed cabin mockup today at the Aircraft Interiors Expo. And Runway Girl Network can reveal that JetBlue Airways is the launch customer.

Airbus has secured suppliers for key aspects of the cabin, including Chinese interiors conglomerate AVIC’s FACC arm for the bins, and is also newly announcing retrofit options for key parts of the Airspace cabin.

Runway Girl Network spoke with Airbus’ Ingo Wuggetzer and Paul Edwards at the unveiling of the A320 family Airspace cabin at the Paris Air Show in June, and sat down at APEX with Wuggetzer for an update. Airbus is plainly and openly moving at speed with Airspace, just over a year since the widebody A330 and A350 Airspace brand was launched at the Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg in spring 2016. “We want to be fast, and be transparent, to see that it’s not only a concept, it’s reality. Second, of course, we see a very strong market in the US, and that’s why we thought APEX in Long Beach was the best place to do so,” vice president for cabin marketing Wuggetzer told RGN.

“We are pushing hard to be ready for 2019 to deliver the bins, and we follow up a year later with the whole cabin — the whole package of Airspace will be delivered in 2020,” Wuggetzer said. Airbus has evolved its thinking on this approach slightly, with the thinking at le Bourget less firm on the two step programme. This approach, Wuggetzer said, “was driven clearly by customer demand. There is really strong value for that feature (of the bin) especially. There is not enough space today, and this is clearly the benchmark in the industry, and that’s why everybody wants it.”

Airbus selected FACC for the bins “because of the experience they have with the current product, which was a clear advantage because we want to deliver not only on time but with a clear, robust product for our customers.”

“We have customers for both steps, big customers, signed,” for the Airspace introduction, Wuggetzer said. JetBlue is a North American launch customer. A second customer has been secured.

After the Paris Air Show, Wuggetzer told RGN, “we got a lot of feedback from leasing companies that we now create a concept that has a consistency between programmes. For them it’s a very positive sign, because of spare parts, commonality in the fleet, that we now push within one year for three programmes all for the same design language, the same solutions, same technology that we also applied for those programmes.”

“There’s a clear preference for the package” from customers, Wuggetzer said. “The commonality is a standard that they want to see as soon as possible. The product is really driven by customer needs. We have signed a customer contract providing retrofit solutions, which is also interesting because that is really new that we have a new interior and people also retrofit elements like bins and so on. That was a really positive signal for us.”

How much can be retrofit — the entire cabin? “You could, of course, but there are things that provide more value and are easier to do, and there are others may be less and harder to achieve,” Wuggetzer admitted. “That’s why our focus is mainly on the bin and on the new lighting system for retrofit. The sidewalls in general are more difficult because you have to change things behind it. It’s not just a new design, because we gained another inch, so that’s more difficult to do. The lightings and the bins are bringing most value.”

Airbus is still working on the bin release mechanism, however, given the additional height of the cabin. “The height of the bin door to close is about the same as we have today in the A330. It’s not really exceptional, but of course it’s used a lot more. That’s why we’re thinking about some feature that makes it even easier than that” to close the bin, Wuggetzer said. “That’s part of the development phase with the supplier that we just started, and there are several options and alternatives available at the moment, and we want to see what is the best solution that is simple, doesn’t add any weight, and is robust.”

How Airbus is accommodating Qantas A380 refit - Runway Girl Network,"Tue, 12 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTcvMDkvaG93LWFpcmJ1cy1pcy1hY2NvbW1vZGF0aW5nLXFhbnRhcy1hMzgwLXJlZml0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Very few aviation industry observers would have predicted Qantas to have selected Airbus as the overhaul partner for its 12 A380 aircraft as the airline seeks to fully revamp the upper deck and perform a lighter refresh on the main deck. Yet Airbus has been quietly looking to do more of this kind of refurbishment work for some time. It’s interesting that Qantas, which has its own large maintenance, repair and overhaul operation for other aircraft in its fleet in Brisbane, as well as a much shorter route to the generally lower priced MRO operations in Asia, would select Airbus for this work.

“Airbus will be responsible for the overall upper-deck integration,” the airframer notes, and this type of work is likely a significant part of Qantas’ selection of the original equipment manufacturer for the task.

There will need to be a certain amount of certification and recertification during the process, and it makes a good amount of sense that Airbus is closely involved. To RGN’s knowledge, for example, this will be the first Airbus A380 cabin with the Thompson Aero Seating Vantage XL seat that Qantas brands as its Business Suite, as well as the airline’s premium economy seat, unveiled earlier this year and also produced by Thompson.

It’s not just seating, either, and with the airline interiors industry not exactly showering itself with glory in recent years with its ability to produce monuments and other cabin items to spec and on time, the move may well signify that airlines — and indeed airframers — have had enough.

“In addition Airbus will develop specific tailored monuments for Qantas and a new and unique business lounge area in the forward upper-deck,” the airframer says. The lounge work will be carried out in conjunction with Qantas’ designer David Caon, who also collaborated with the airline on its present business and premium economy seating.

Airbus notes that, “in particular, the new interior takes advantage of the A380’s large floor area to most efficiently embody Qantas’ latest seat products for business class and premium economy.”

It’s also notable both how far out this announcement has been made, and how quickly the actual upgrades will take place

“The installation phase will start in the second quarter of 2019,” Airbus says. This amount of lead time could signify a relatively major certification effort required on the part of the airframer, as well as Qantas’ desire to be able to unveil the passenger experience upgrade news as part of its showcase year-end financial results. It’s unclear what Qantas (or indeed Airbus) would gain from delaying for two weeks after the upgrade news to announce the refit partner.

The refit, when it comes, will be a fast one, with Airbus noting that “all 12 aircraft are planned to be upgraded by around the end of 2020.” If we take that to mean the end of 2020 and not halfway through 2021, that’s one aircraft every six weeks if the refits are programmed to take place consecutively, or every twelve weeks if the programme goes two A380s at a time. Some of this capacity will be taken up by the transition of the Melbourne-Dubai-London A380 flight to the Boeing 787-9 via Perth, and indeed by the replacement of Boeing 747-400 and -400ER aircraft by other Dreamliners in the fleet on the longer and thinner routes where Qantas believes that it can operate the 787 most efficiently.

But from a passenger experience viewpoint, there are real questions for Qantas as to whether a staggered seat like the Vantage XL will continue to capture the premium market if newly installed on its A380s five years after the airline first started to install it.

From a current perspective, it would be like an airline installing five-year-old seats. Consider the 2012 vintage of business class products today: Lufthansa’s bespoke Diamond-based Rockwell Collins product; KLM’s customised version of Diamond; Austrian’s first-generation Vantage; Virgin Atlantic’s now-scrapped Dream Suite. None are class-leading, and one is being removed. A lot can happen in five years — and, indeed, Delta Air Lines has already been doing a lot with its Vantage XL+ version of the Qantas seat, offering as it does a proper suite with door for every passenger. Qantas will need to do a significant amount of work to keep its passenger experience up to date.

On the accountancy side of the equation, Airbus says it will “further improve passenger comfort on long-haul operations while maximising economics,” the latter of which has been and continues to be a problem for the A380 from the airline perspective. The airframer will be glad to have an opportunity to set out its stall in a practical, real-world feeling with an A380 refit that includes a modern, four-cabin aircraft, a decade on from the introduction into service of the superjumbo.

“The upgrade will meet the airline’s increased demand for revenue-enhancing premium cabins on flights to the US, Europe and Asia,” Airbus notes, and indeed this increased premium demand, together with the concomitant demand for space in the cabin, is one of the arguments that the manufacturer will continue to use for the A380’s future. Clearly, if airlines are going to want to nearly double the amount of premium economy seats they offer on an aircraft, as Qantas has done here, they will need larger jets if they want to transport the same number of passengers.

But at the end of the day, Airbus commercial aircraft executive vice president for programmes Didier Evrard also rather hit the nail on the head for why Airbus may have been keen to undertake the work: “This also shows the continued confidence of Qantas in the A380 as a key member of its fleet to offer its passengers a unique way to travel.” That continued confidence — and from an airline as respected for its considered and long-term view of fleeting as Qantas — is very valuable indeed to Airbus.

"Engine breaks up on Air France Airbus A380, forcing emergency landing in Canada - The Guardian","Sat, 30 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDE3L29jdC8wMS9lbmdpbmUtYnJlYWtzLXVwLW9uLWFpci1mcmFuY2UtYTM4MC1mb3JjaW5nLWVtZXJnZW5jeS1sYW5kaW5nLWluLWNhbmFkYdIBeGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDE3L29jdC8wMS9lbmdpbmUtYnJlYWtzLXVwLW9uLWFpci1mcmFuY2UtYTM4MC1mb3JjaW5nLWVtZXJnZW5jeS1sYW5kaW5nLWluLWNhbmFkYQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An Air France A380 superjumbo jetliner taking more than 500 people from Paris to Los Angeles made an emergency landing in Canada on Saturday following “serious damage” to one of its four engines, the airline said.



“Flight 066 landed without further damage at the Goose Bay military airport in Canada and all of the 520 people on board were evacuated with no injuries,” an Air France spokesman in Paris said.

The Airbus double-decker, wide body aircraft was rerouted as it passed over Greenland, landing in Goose Bay in eastern Canada, the spokesman said.

The landing went off with no problems for the jetliner carrying 496 passengers and 24 crew members, the spokesman said. The airline was exploring options to get the passengers to the US.

Video and photo images posted on social media, apparently by passengers or their relatives, showed extensive damage to the front of the outer starboard engine, with part of its external cowling stripped away.

The cause of the problem was unknown, with one of the plane’s passengers suggesting that a bird might have collided with the engine which was damaged.

The passenger, Miguel Amador, posted online brief video footage apparently filmed from a window of the plane showing the damaged engine.

“Engine failure halfway over the Atlantic ocean … birdstrike possibility,” he wrote.

Air France operates 10 Airbus A380s, which are the largest passenger planes in the world.

Their version of the craft uses GP7200 engines, a giant turbofan built by General Electric and Pratt and Whitney of the US.

Goose Bay is a base operated by the Royal Canadian Air Force but is also a designated standby airport for diverted transatlantic flights.

Sales of the mammoth A380 have been sluggish and Airbus has said it will reduce production in 2019 to just eight of the superjumbos.

In 2015 the company produced 27 of them.

Nonetheless, Airbus CEO Tom Enders recently voiced confidence in the future of the plane.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9851400256156921}",negative,0.9851400256156921,-1
Airbus and Arconic install first metal additively manufactured part on series production commercial aircraft - Metal Additive Manufacturing magazine,"Thu, 21 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ldGFsLWFtLmNvbS9haXJidXMtYXJjb25pYy1pbnN0YWxsLWZpcnN0LW1ldGFsLWFkZGl0aXZlbHktbWFudWZhY3R1cmVkLXBhcnQtc2VyaWVzLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tY29tbWVyY2lhbC1haXJjcmFmdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Share to your network:









Airbus and Arconic Inc. have installed a metal additively manufactured titanium bracket on a series production aircraft. The bracket, which is being produced at Arconic’s Additive Manufacturing facility in Austin, Texas, USA, is installed on the Airbus A350 XWB, the company’s newest widebody commercial aircraft.

While airplane makers have been using Additive Manufacturing for some time, until recently this has primarily been for components inside the cabin. Equipping the airframes themselves with metal AM parts is a newer field.

In addition, the bracket’s installation on a series production commercial airplane, as opposed to a test airplane, marks a significant step forward in the qualification of more complex metal AM parts for production aircraft. While metal additively manufactured cabin brackets and bleed pipes are already flying on Airbus’s A320neo and A350 XWB test aircraft, this reportedly marks the first installation of a titanium additively manufactured bracket on a commercial aircraft for series production.

Jeremy Halford, President of Arconic Titanium and Engineered Products, commented, “Arconic is proud to partner with Airbus to advance aerospace Additive Manufacturing. Our comprehensive capabilities, from materials science leadership to qualification expertise, helped make this achievement possible. We look forward to continuing to advance the art of the possible in additive for aerospace.”

This AM titanium bracket is the latest product of Airbus and Arconic’s ongoing partnership, which was founded in December 2016 with the signing of three agreements for Arconic to produce titanium and nickel additively manufactured parts for commercial aircraft, including the A320 platform and A350 XWB.

Airbus prepares the future European Governmental Satellite Communications programme - Airbus,"Mon, 11 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNy0wOS1haXJidXMtcHJlcGFyZXMtdGhlLWZ1dHVyZS1ldXJvcGVhbi1nb3Zlcm5tZW50YWwtc2F0ZWxsaXRl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris, 11 September 2017 – Airbus has been contracted by the European Space Agency (ESA) to produce a demonstrator for the future European Governmental Satellite Communications (GOVSATCOM) programme. Supported by the European Commission, the European Defence Agency (EDA) and ESA, GOVSATCOM aims to provide key European countries, organisations and operators with secured satellite communication services. The programme should be launched by 2020 and follows in the footsteps of major European programmes such as Copernicus, Galileo and EDRS-SpaceDataHighway.

The demonstrator contract is to last two years and comprises two parts. The first part involves producing a system of dynamic sharing of satellite capabilities. The core of the ground system is based on the Newtec Dialog technology developed by the Belgian company Newtec and will be installed at the Airbus site in Toulouse. It will be operated by various European governmental entities and employed particularly in overseas theatres of operations. An end-to-end service demonstrator will illustrate the attractiveness, flexibility and simplicity of the proposed services.

The second part of the project concerns a technological development designed to improve the performance of Newtec Dialog platform. The objective is to draw all possible benefits from the pooling of capabilities for the future generation of governmental satellites, whose coverage areas will be configurable in real time. The innovation will enable mobile users to switch transparently from one satellite beam to another while at the same time protecting the confidentiality of their operations.

This demonstrator contract follows on from the two design studies in which Airbus participated between 2015 and 2017 on behalf of the ESA and EDA respectively. These studies served to define and quantify the nature of the European governmental users’ needs and assess the various technologies and architectures of the GOVSATCOM programme, as well as the advantages of the ‘pooling and sharing’ model.

The GOVSATCOM programme should initially focus essentially on the pooling and sharing of communication capabilities provided by governmental satellites and commercial operator satellites already in orbit. The demonstrator project developed by the ESA and Airbus prepares for this first step that is also supported by the EDA with fourteen European Union countries (Austria, Belgium, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom) and Norway agreeing in June 2017 to develop a demonstrator for pooling and sharing satellite communication capabilities.

As a ground segment integrator and communications satellite manufacturer and operator, Airbus already supplies satellite communication systems to the governments of European countries such as France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Norway, as well as to the EDA and NATO.

European laminar flow research takes a new step with Airbus' BLADE Flight Lab - Airbus,"Tue, 26 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE3LTA5LWV1cm9wZWFuLWxhbWluYXItZmxvdy1yZXNlYXJjaC10YWtlcy1hLW5ldy1zdGVwLXdpdGgtYWlyYnVzLWJsYWRlLWZsaWdodC1sYWLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus today initiated its latest research in further reducing the fuel consumption of airliners – keeping the company and Europe at the forefront of enhancing air transportation’s ecological footprint.

Today’s milestone was the Airbus A340 Flight Lab’s first takeoff equipped with outer wing sections designed for highly smooth airflow over their surfaces. Known as natural laminar flow, such smoothed passage of air creates less drag than the airflow on traditional wings, potentially reducing fuel burn by as much as 4.6 percent on an 800-nautical mile trip.

Designated as project BLADE – an acronym for Breakthrough Laminar Aircraft Demonstrator in Europe – this research effort utilises the first-ever A340 jetliner produced by Airbus, with its outboard wings replaced with approximately 10-meter-long laminar wing panels. These panels represent about two-thirds of the wing size on a short- or medium-range airliner, for which the laminar flow technology is deemed best suited.



Collecting 2,000 parameters during some 150 flight test hours

BLADE is organized through Europe’s Clean Sky aeronautical research program. The BLADE project involves 21 European partners with 500 contributors, including GKN Aerospace: designer of the starboard laminar flow wing panel, and Saab: designer of the port wing segment.

Airbus flight test engineer Philippe Seve said preparations of the A340 BLADE testbed spanned 16 months, which included integration of the laminar flow wing sections, along with the installation of a highly complex installation of sensors and instrumentation to collect 2,750 dedicated measurements during some 150 flight test hours.

A team of 10 specially-trained pilots, test engineers and flight test engineers have been preparing for the A340 BLADE flight evaluations, spending time in a simulator and familiarising themselves with the mission equipment – the most technologically-advanced to be installed on an Airbus flight test aircraft.

Bombardier pushes for competition that will benefit consumers - USA TODAY,"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9vcGluaW9uLzIwMTcvMDkvMjIvYm9laW5ncy1iYXR0bGUtYWdhaW5zdC1ib21iYXJkaWVyLXB1bmlzaGVzLWNvbnN1bWVycy82ODg3NTEwMDEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing's battle against Bombardier punishes consumers The anti-dumping case filed against the Canadian plane-maker will stifle innovation.

We all know that today’s airplanes are not designed to keep coach passengers happy. But, what if they were? In fact, a Canadian company, Bombardier, has created an aircraft with an eye toward passenger comfort and safety. And guess what happened? The giant Boeing Inc. filed an anti-dumping case to stop Bombardier from selling its new, passenger-friendly aircraft in the U.S.

Bombardier’s new regional plane, the CS100, addresses today’s main airline consumer issue — coach passengers are squeezed into tiny seats like sardines. Bombardier’s wider seats, bigger overhead baggage space, larger windows, and quieter engines add up to a better passenger experience. Travelers United would like to see more of these kinds of improvements.

More so, new competition within the airline industry is a welcome change. When two mega-companies — Airbus and Boeing — control most of the marketplace any new competition brings a smile to a consumer’s face. Plus, when new technology is used to change the flight experience and allows airlines to better match aircraft to route dynamics, consumers win.

Boeing’s competitive issues with Bombardier were quiet until the Canadian firm made a big sale to Delta Air Lines. Though the mighty US company has no direct competition with the 100-to-150-seat Bombardier aircraft, Boeing has taken the case to the International Trade Commission (ITC) accusing Bombardier of dumping planes on the American market. Thus, Boeing is claiming competitive harm.

Sun Country and Spirit Airlines also are opposed to Boeing’s antidumping case filed against Bombardier C Series. Both low-cost airlines decry the assault by Boeing on competition and innovation.

There are a few salient issues that make this a case important for Travelers United and all air travelers looking for a better flying experience.

· The Bombardier plane has been created with passenger comfort in mind. Wider coach than any installed in Boeing aircraft – 18 inch for the aisle and window seats; and up to 19-inch-wide middle seats — can be installed.

· Larger overhead baggage bins are available that can take four rollaboards per row above seats, eliminating overcrowding with bags and the need to check many bags.

· Windows are larger on this “small” aircraft than on the Boeing 737 creating a more pleasant flying experience.

POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media

Our organization changed the airplane seat size debate in DC to substantive issues like safety when dealing with emergency evacuation and health considering deep vein thrombosis. In 2016, the Department of Transportaion’s (DOT) Advisory Committee for Aviation Consumer Protections held half a day of meetings to discuss both health and safety of current aircraft seating configurations and urged the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to retest its approved seat configurations to ensure that planes do not become death traps in emergencies.

One consumer group even took the FAA to federal court. The group claimed that the FAA-mandated 90-second evacuation requirements cannot be ensured as the flying public gets bigger and seat size gets smaller. This summer, the courts said FAA must produce evacuation studies showing that proper testing has been completed with the kind of tight seating being installed in many aircraft today. The FAA evacuation studies either need to be redone or released, if complete.

Depending on the outcome of the Boeing complaint, Bombardier may have found a way to wedge its way into the world’s largest aircraft market.

Competition among the major aircraft manufacturers is the elixir for a better passenger experience. As Bombardier planes penetrate the Airbus/Boeing manufacturing world it will help drive seat costs lower for airlines and, thus, passengers. Just as Airbus entered the aviation world to provide competition to McDonald Douglas and Boeing, Bombardier can bring back a three-company competitive environment and better consumer comfort while aloft.

Alaska Airlines is going to roll out a San Francisco Giants Airbus A321 - USA TODAY,"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFodHRwczovL3d3dy51c2F0b2RheS5jb20vc3RvcnkvdHJhdmVsL2ZsaWdodHMvdG9kYXlpbnRoZXNreS8yMDE3LzA5LzEzL2FsYXNrYS1haXJsaW5lcy1nb2luZy1yb2xsLW91dC1zYW4tZnJhbmNpc2NvLWdpYW50cy1haXJidXMtYS0zMjEvNjYyMTc2MDAxL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Alaska Airlines is going to roll out a San Francisco Giants Airbus A321

Alaska Airlines will soon be flying an Airbus A321 painted in the colors of the San Francisco Giants baseball team.

The Seattle-based carrier announced the news Wednesday as it detailed an agreement to become the official airline of the team for the next seven years.

The move also underscores Alaska Airlines’ attempt to win over the San Francisco market following its acquisition of hometown carrier Virgin America in a deal that closed late last year. Alaska Airlines’ new pact with the Giants extends a deal that had been in place with Virgin America.

""Our commitment to San Francisco and our Bay Area employees has never been stronger and, as part of that, we're thrilled to extend the Giants sponsorship for the next seven years,"" Andrew Harrison, Alaska Airlines' chief commercial officer, said in a statement.

Aside from the snazzy Giants-themed jet, there will be a “customized” Alaska Airlines suite at AT&T Park, the Giants’ home stadium. The stadium’s club level section also will be renamed as the ""Alaska Airlines Club Level.”

Alaska Airlines’ move to cement its ties to the Bay Area comes amid a turf war over California that seems to have erupted following its acquisition of Virgin America. Both Alaska Airlines and rival Southwest have been adding new routes at a breakneck pace at a number of California airports this year.

That includes more than a dozen new routes announced by Alaska Airlines for the San Francisco hub it is inheriting from Virgin America. Alaska and Virgin America are now in the process of integrating their operations and frequent-flier programs, with the Virgin America name expected to be phased out in 2019.

As for the Giants aircraft, it will be the second to fly in a pro baseball-themed livery for Alaska Airlines. In June, the carrier rolled out a ""specially-marked"" Boeing 737-800.

Boeing claims victory in 13-year-long war with Airbus over subsidies - Business Insider,"Tue, 05 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYm9laW5nLXdvbi1hLW1ham9yLXZpY3RvcnktaW4tYS1iYXR0bGUtd2l0aC1haXJidXMtc3Vic2lkaWVzLTIwMTctOdIBZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYm9laW5nLXdvbi1hLW1ham9yLXZpY3RvcnktaW4tYS1iYXR0bGUtd2l0aC1haXJidXMtc3Vic2lkaWVzLTIwMTctOT9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Boeing 777-9X.

The World Trade Organization has reversed a ruling that Boeing received prohibited subsidies for its 777X jet.

Airbus and Boeing have been engaged in a 13-year-long dispute over government subsidies.

The ruling is not expected to end the long-running dispute.

PARIS/GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Trade Organization has reversed a ruling that Boeing received prohibited support for its newest aircraft, dealing a blow to the European Union in its long-running row with the United States over subsidies.



Monday's decision by WTO appeal judges overturns a ruling which had banned some Washington-state support for plants including a $1 billion factory designed to build the world's largest carbon-composite wings for Boeing's 777X jet.



A WTO panel ruled last year that a reduction in the state's business and occupation tax in return for a decision to place 777X production in the state had deliberately shut out imports.



But its appeals body found the tax breaks had not explicitly targeted trade flows, removing them from the WTO's most severe category of banned aid known as ""prohibited"" subsidies.



The decision neutralizes a potential trump card, which the EU played in 2014 to shake up the world’s biggest trade dispute.



Prohibited subsidies are a form of aid that the WTO's 164 members consider exceptionally market-distorting and are automatically banned wherever they are proved to exist.



The WTO appeals body did not consider whether the 777X tax credits fell under the more common banner of ""actionable"" subsidies, since the EU had not resorted to fallback arguments as it gambled on securing a quick, game-changing victory.



But the EU may use evidence from the case to try to widen a previous successful claim against earlier versions of the same tax credits, meaning that although the EU's latest gambit failed, the 13-year-old war between Washington and Brussels over support for their dominant plane makers will continue.



""Today’s ruling will strengthen the (original EU) case on the long term and allow us to expand our compliance demands,"" Airbus spokeswoman Maggie Bergsma said, while Boeing called the ruling a ""sweeping and clear win"".



U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the EU had lost most of its claims and ""cannot justify their own illegal subsidies by hiding behind groundless claims against the U.S.""



COMPLIANCE



Neither side has been able to make the key charge of prohibited subsidies stick at the appeals stage but both have won billions of dollars of claims about ""actionable"" subsidies, while disagreeing over who comes off worst and racking up an estimated $100 million in costs.



The WTO is considering appeals on whether each side complied with previous demands to remove billions of dollars of unfair support. A decision on whether the EU has fallen into line is expected at the end of the year, with a ruling on U.S. compliance due in 2018.



U.S. sources say the timetable could give the administration of President Donald Trump, who has pledged tough enforcement of trade laws, the first crack at introducing sanctions that could theoretically be targeted at any industry, not just aerospace.



If either side is found not to have complied by removing the harmful support for its planes, the other will be able to impose counter-measures. However, new disputes could arise if sanctions are imposed, despite claims to have complied subsequently.



A European source predicted legal procedures could continue indefinitely until both sides decide to settle. Airbus renewed a call for a broad global agreement on support for planemakers.

First civil customer Nolas takes delivery of an H135 with Helionix - Airbus,"Mon, 04 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNy0wOS1maXJzdC1jaXZpbC1jdXN0b21lci1ub2xhcy10YWtlcy1kZWxpdmVyeS1vZi1hbi1oMTM1LXdpdGgtaGVsaW9uaXjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Donauwörth, – The Norwegian air ambulance operator Norsk Luftambulanse AS (NOLAS) is the first civil customer to receive an H135 equipped with Helionix. Six additional H135s with Helionix will be delivered to NOLAS in 2017 and 2018. In December 2016, the UK MoD was the first military customer to receive the new H135 with Helionix.

NOLAS won a national HEMS (Helicopter Emergency Medical Services) tender in Norway in 2016, and a total of 12 bases and 17 new helicopters will be operated from June 1, 2018. All helicopters are equipped for 24/7 operations with state-of-the-art configuration for Single Pilot IFR/Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) operation, Aerolite interiors and the latest medical equipment. With a specially trained anesthesiologist, a pilot and a HEMS crew member, and a specially configured helicopter, NOLAS do on-scene missions as well as advanced intensive care transportation in the demanding environment of Norway.

The H135 obtained EASA certification for the Helionix avionics suite in November 2016. The Helionix avionics system designed by Airbus offers operators with increased mission flexibility and safety. Helionix is a family concept with standardized features and is already available on the H175 and H145.

On top of the 4-axis autopilot, Helionix offers an innovative cockpit layout which helps to increase situational awareness. Designed with three large electronic displays on the H135, the cockpit is Night Vision Goggle compatible and includes a First Limit Indicator which highlights the appropriate engine instrument data for the pilot in one indicator.

The H135 is a helicopter of reference for air ambulance operators worldwide. It combines a wide, unobstructed cabin with excellent performance, range and payload capacity – along with low-noise operations. The oversized sliding side doors and rear clamshell doors enable fast loading/unloading of patients, with additional safety during ground operations provided by Airbus’ signature shrouded Fenestron tail rotor.

“In demanding environments and under almost all kind of weather challenges, it is great to have the support of the new technological developments that the Helionix version can offer”, said NOLAS CEO Rune Midtgaard. “It reduces the pilot workload, increases the safety of the operation and in the end the ability to reach the patients in need of the advanced medical support the service can offer.”

“We are proud that NOLAS trusts our helicopter and the Helionix suite for their challenging missions” said Martin Schneider, head of the H135 programme. “The H135 is the unbeaten market leader in light twin-engine, multi-purpose helicopters. Traditional missions for this class of helicopters include emergency medical services, law enforcement, VIP and business passenger transport, maintenance of industrial wind parks and military training.”

Airbus has delivered more than 1,250 H135s to customers around the globe who have logged a total of more than four million flight hours.

About Nolas

NOLAS is fully owned by the Norwegian Air Ambulance Foundation. Since 1978 has the Foundation supported and developed the pre-hospital care in Norway, and through NOLAS executed advanced HEMS with BO105s, AS 365s, EC 135s and EC145. NOLAS is also sole HEMS operator in Denmark with three EC135s under contract with the Danish Regions. From June 2018 the company will be the national RW HEMS operator of Norway, with seven H135, eight H145 and two AW139s.

JetBlue will become the first airline to introduce Airspace by Airbus on the A320 Family, following an agreement unveiled at APEX Expo. JetBlue customers will experience this newest A320 Family cabin aboard JetBlue aircraft starting in late 2020.

Robin Hayes, President and CEO of JetBlue commented: “The Airspace cabin is aligned with our efforts to create an experience as comfortable as your own living room. We are looking forward to our continued partnership with Airbus. The launch of the new Airspace by Airbus interior will takes JetBlue’s commitment to customer experience to the next level.”

Dr. Kiran Rao, Deputy to COO Customers at Airbus Commercial Aircraft said: “We are delighted to be working together with JetBlue on the next generation of cabin experience for the A320 Family.” Rao added: “Airspace offers the kind of features previously reserved for a few long haul cabins, so bringing that to our best-selling aircraft family is really going to be noticed by airlines and passengers.”

The longstanding partnership between Airbus and JetBlue began in 1999 when JetBlue was launched and took delivery of its first A320. Two years later the airline placed an order for 48 Airbus planes. Following years of extraordinary growth, JetBlue now operates a fleet of 176 A320 and A321 aircraft and has another 102 on order from Airbus.

Ingo Wuggetzer, VP Cabin Marketing said: “We are very proud to jointly reveal with JetBlue the first A320 Airspace mock-up at APEX Expo in Long Beach, California, which gives a first glimpse of what promises to be a match made at 35,000ft.” He adds: “As industry leader and trendsetter, JetBlue has the ideal DNA to launch the world’s newest single-aisle interior with us.”

Highlights of the new Airspace cabin in the A320 Family include: a unique welcome experience. In particular, a customizable welcome effect is extended throughout the cabin by a central lighting strip which is visible even with open bin doors during boarding. The A320 Family cabin with Airspace features the industry’s largest overhead bins, whose conformal exterior profile facilitates smooth boarding. Throughout the cabin passengers will appreciate the increased interior width, the soothing ambience of the latest full-colour LED lighting, and a contemporary lavatory design with new comfort features.

“Arconic is proud to partner with Airbus to advance aerospace additive manufacturing,” said Jeremy Halford, President of Arconic Titanium and Engineered Products. “Our comprehensive capabilities, from materials science leadership to qualification expertise, helped make this achievement possible. We look forward to continuing to advance the art of the possible in additive for aerospace.”

As for Airbus,this is not a première for the specialist of aerospace regarding additive manufacturing in general. Indeed, the company had already signed a commercial agreement with Dassault Systèmes for a large-scale production using additive manufacturing. Another collaboration is seen with 3D Systems to achieve first 3D Printed RF Filter.

A 3D printed titanium part, a milestone for AM in aerospace

The reality is that, airplane makers have been using 3D printed parts for quite some time, largely for components inside the cabin. Equipping airframes with metal parts produced via additive manufacturing is new.

In addition, Airbus’s installation of this 3D printed titanium bracket on a series production commercial airplane, as opposed to a test airplane, marks a significant step forward in the qualification of more complex 3D printed parts for production aircraft.

3D-printed parts, including metal printed cabin brackets and bleed pipes, are already flying on Airbus A320neo and A350 XWB test aircraft.

This 3D printed titanium bracket is part of an ongoing partnership between Airbus and Arconic. Last year, the technology, engineering and advanced manufacturing giant announced three agreements with Airbus to produce titanium and nickel 3D printed parts for commercial aircraft, including the A320 platform and A350 XWB.

"Malaysia Airlines further clarifies fleet strategy, to lease six Airbus 330-200 - aviator.aero","Wed, 27 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3c3Jvb20uYXZpYXRvci5hZXJvL21hbGF5c2lhLWFpcmxpbmVzLWZ1cnRoZXItY2xhcmlmaWVzLWZsZWV0LXN0cmF0ZWd5LXRvLWxlYXNlLXNpeC1haXJidXMtMzMwLTIwMC_SAXFodHRwczovL25ld3Nyb29tLmF2aWF0b3IuYWVyby9tYWxheXNpYS1haXJsaW5lcy1mdXJ0aGVyLWNsYXJpZmllcy1mbGVldC1zdHJhdGVneS10by1sZWFzZS1zaXgtYWlyYnVzLTMzMC0yMDAvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Kuala Lumpur, 27 September 2017: Malaysia Airlines today provided further clarification on its fleet strategy, following its previous updates on the matter.

Malaysia Airlines fleet strategy is a key component of the ongoing five-year 12-point MAS Recovery Plan (MRP) unveiled on 29 August 2014, which calls for the resetting of the airline’s operating business model towards a competitive cost position, with a focus on the network and revenue management.

At a special briefing for the media held today, Malaysia Airlines Chairman Tan Sri Md Nor Yusof said: “The airline business is extremely complex and dynamic where there is often a mismatch between readiness and opportunity, where readiness to expand does not often coincide with appropriate and available aircraft and available customers does not automatically mean available landing rights. Airlines have to be agile in order to balance this.”

In his presentation to media, Malaysia Airlines Chief Executive Officer Peter Bellew provided an in-depth update on Malaysia Airlines’ fleet strategy, as well as its business performance, products and services, among others.

As emphasized in its statement on 21 September 2017, Malaysia Airlines has a firm order of 25 Boeing 737 aircraft and options on other types of aircraft, including both new and used aircraft from Boeing and Airbus. Overall, this strategy will provide Malaysia Airlines with the flexibility in deciding which aircraft suits its operational environment best moving forward.

In line with this, Bellew also announced that Malaysia Airlines has signed a Letter of Intent (LOI) for the lease of six (6) second hand Airbus A330-200, as replacement for six narrowbody Boeing 737 that are being returned to lessors . The A330-200 aircraft, expected to begin arriving from February 2018, will allow the airline to bridge the next generation wide-body aircraft orders. The LOI with AerCap, the lessor of the aircraft, was signed today.

As per the LOI, the A330-200s will be leased for six years from 2018 to 2023 and will mainly be used to up-gauge several high-demand medium haul routes. The aircraft features are very similar to Malaysia Airlines’ current A330-300 fleet with exactly the same Pratt & Whitney engines. Malaysia Airlines is negotiating a maintenance support programme with Pratt & Whitney. The six aircraft will have a two class configuration, 287 seats with 19 fully lie flat Business Class seats, brand new IFE on all seats and WiFi.

Group CEO Peter Bellew said, “As laid out in the MRP, we are working hard on bringing the airline to a competitive cost position. We also want to rebuild Malaysia Airlines so we can reassume our previous premier position in the industry. The current lease rates are incredibly competitive and we are being opportunistic by leasing them at this point.”

“As I have communicated, we have an immediate need for widebodies to offer more lie flat beds in Business Class on our flights over three hours. Malaysia Airlines has done an opportunistic deal on super aircraft from a failed European carrier. I am grateful to AerCap for their speed in working with Malaysia Airlines to help rebuild our premium business,” Peter Bellew concluded.

Malaysia Airlines currently operates six A380s, 15 A330-300s and 48 B737-800s.

Tan Sri Md Nor Yusof said, “I am pleased to share that Malaysia Airlines saw a gap in our service a year ago and this foresight has enabled us to act swiftly when this opportunity of potentially adding six very affordable widebody aircraft, arose. The right aircraft at the right time at the right price is key to our success and these aircraft will enable us to create a much improved customer experience as we move towards transforming the airline into a premium 5-star carrier once again.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999970197677612}",neutral,0.9999970197677612,0
Britain's aerospace sector could be priced out after Brexit - The Guardian,"Sun, 03 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDE3L3NlcC8wMy9icml0YWluLWFlcm9zcGFjZS1zZWN0b3ItY291bGQtYmUtcHJpY2VkLW91dC1hZnRlci1icmV4aXTSAWpodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAxNy9zZXAvMDMvYnJpdGFpbi1hZXJvc3BhY2Utc2VjdG9yLWNvdWxkLWJlLXByaWNlZC1vdXQtYWZ0ZXItYnJleGl0?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A grey metal box in the North Wales countryside is home to the jewel of Britain’s aerospace industry.

Airbus’s factory in Broughton, Flintshire, is where the pan-European aerospace and defence group manufactures all the wings for its commercial aircraft. The well-paid jobs, cutting-edge technology and headline-grabbing products are highly prized – by Britain, and by other Airbus factories around Europe.

Airbus has long fought off green-eyed advances from its plants in Toulouse, Hamburg and elsewhere, which are keen to wrest wing production from Britain’s clutches. But there are concerns that the vote to leave the European Union has weakened Britain’s grip on this precious gem.

High-tech manufacturers such as Dyson have dismissed concerns that extra tariffs and possible delays at borders after Brexit will hinder trade.

That may be true for independent businesses but less so for foreign-owned companies that are part of supply chains across the EU, from the car industry to pharmaceuticals, plastics and, crucially, aerospace where politics plays such an important role.

Britain has maintained its slice of the Airbus pie as long as it has been a large net contributor to the EU budget. Without that leverage, there must be a question mark over future investment.

Paul Everitt, the chief executive of ADS, the trade body for the aerospace, defence, security and space sectors, said: “We are concerned that there could be a long-term erosion of Britain’s competitiveness and that big projects will not be allocated to the UK. We are currently a big player in the aerospace industry.”

Everitt is not alone. Senior Airbus executives have warned that erecting barriers to the free movement of parts and people across its European sites may cause lasting damage to Britain’s aerospace industry.

Airbus spends about £4bn a year with suppliers in the UK – a significant contribution to Britain’s aerospace industry, which supports about 110,000 high-value, highly skilled jobs. The group employs 15,000 people directly in the UK. About 4,000 of these design the wings for Airbus planes at Filton, Bristol; a further 6,000 workers build more than 1,000 wings each year at Broughton.

The Welsh factory is where aviation classics, such as De Havilland’s Comet and Mosquito, were produced. These days, it is responsible for assembling the wings for all Airbus civil aircraft, including the new-generation A350 XWB (extra wide body).

The enormous plant receives millions of components each year from other Airbus factories and suppliers around Europe. Once the wings are built, these complex, giant structures are delivered to final assembly lines in various ways, including by road and on the Airbus Beluga super transporter aircraft.

Wings for the A380 are sent by road and sea for final aircraft assembly in Toulouse. At present, there are no restrictions or tariffs on the movement of these parts or on the people who oversee this fiendishly complicated jigsaw.

Everitt noted: “As an industry, we run a complex set of manufacturing processes in which millions of components need to pitch up from Toulouse at the right time and in the right order. [Brexit] implies significant cost … The concern is that the UK becomes less competitive because there are extra costs with moving people and components around.”

He noted that aerospace was a capital-intensive, long-cycle industry, so there were unlikely to be dramatic changes on day one of Britain’s exit from the EU.

Last month, Katherine Bennett, the head of Airbus UK, wrote in Bristol’s Western Daily Press: “We can’t shy away from the fact that future investments made by Airbus will inevitably depend on the economic environment in which we operate. The company’s business model is based on our ability to move products, people and ideas around Europe free from restrictions.”

Bennett’s comment hints at the internal dialogue at Airbus – that Brexit may hand a crucial advantage to sites in Toulouse and Hamburg, which want to grab future wing work from Britain. Even before the vote to leave the EU, well-placed sources said there was constant lobbying from the French and Germans to prise wing manufacturing away from Britain.

A senior industry source said: “It’s a constant and transparent pressure. They have always argued for that work. The next plane that comes out, I would be very surprised if the UK got much work on it. The numbers will be difficult for the UK [because of Brexit]. The question asked will be ‘why should [new aircraft projects] come to the UK?’”

What about the expertise of the engineers at Filton and Broughton? The source reckons 10% of the commercial aviation workforce – about 1,000 key engineers [800 at Filton and just 200 at Broughton] – “make the difference”. “Everything else is a commodity; everything else is up for grabs,” he said.

“For future products, as the business grows, the company will have to progressively globalise its business. I think they will offer what they do in the UK, which is cutting-edge wing design, to other companies for them to manufacture.”

A Brexit-inspired shift in wing production would not only be a huge blow to Broughton, it would be likely to trigger an exodus of suppliers. Worryingly, GKN, an engineering group that supplies the aerospace industry, last month said it would be forced to follow Airbus if it shuffled work from Britain to other sites in Europe.

Kevin Cummings, chief executive of GKN’s aerospace business, said the FTSE 100 engineering group would have to move its emphasis to where its customers were. “We are also just as much European as we are a UK company,” Cummings added.

Despite this, insiders reckon the Broughton plant should be secure for another 20 years, because it produces wings for the bestselling short-haul A320 and the mid-range A350 aircraft. But there is a growing acknowledgement that new models could be built elsewhere, unless Brexit can deliver “frictionless trade”.

Another source with knowledge of Airbus said: “Airbus is looking to make big decisions over the next two to five years. So the government needs to do what it did for the A320 and chuck in a big sum of money [to secure work for the next model].”

If the competitiveness of British sites is threatened, there is likely to be a long-term detrimental effect on Airbus’s future in the UK. “A rejection of the EU by the UK is perceived by many people in Airbus as a rejection of the values that underpin Airbus,” said the source.

“It would be foolish for Airbus to take work out and shut Broughton. But it doesn’t want to give the Europeans an excuse to marginalise the UK, and Brexit gives them an excuse.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7979763150215149}",neutral,0.7979763150215149,0
Airbus installs first 3D printed titanium bracket on a production A350 aircraft - 3D Printing Industry,"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vM2RwcmludGluZ2luZHVzdHJ5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1pbnN0YWxscy1maXJzdC0zZC1wcmludGVkLXRpdGFuaXVtLWJyYWNrZXQtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1hMzUwLWFpcmNyYWZ0LTEyMTIxMi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has completed the installation of a 3D printed titanium bracket on an in-series production A350 XWB aircraft.

Though in service since January 2015 with 1,000 3D printed parts on board, the A350 bracket marks Airbus’ expansion of its 3D printed part catalog for the plane, showing that additive manufacturing for production continues to make progress.

3D printing is not a gimmick

The 3D printed bracket is part of the aircraft pylon, the segment of a plane attaching jet engines to the wings.

Historically, Airbus has used Concept Laser M2 cusing machines to produce its metal additive parts. As of December 2016, the company has also been developing Sciaky’s electron beam additive manufacturing (EBAM) for use in large, flight-integral parts.

In ongoing improvements to the double-deck A380 plane, Airbus worked with Swiss industrial and mechanical engineering company Liebherr and the Chemnitz University of Technology to 3D print the spoiler actuator valve block inside the wing.

Ben Sandilands, transport specialist and editor of Plane Talking, writes that the new 3D printed titanium bracket from Airbus is “a note to those who think 3D printing is a gimmick.”

As 3D Printing Industry readers will already be aware the use of additive manufacturing for the production of aerospace components has a long history.

One example being the F-15 Pylon Rib made by Airbus rival, Boeing. Entering service in 2003, Boeing’s Leo Christodoulou, Director of Structures and Materials, Enterprise Operations and Technology, describes the titanium components as, “the biggest success story that exists”.

Additive manufacturing in aerospace

The A350 XWB plane is Airbus’ competition for Boeing’s 787 and 777 models.

Together with Dassault Systèmes, Boeing has created a digital twin of the 777 aircraft, aiding in the further development of the company’s long-range plane that has been in service since 1994.

The GE9X engine, containing components made on EOS additive manufacturing machines, is also set for installation in the forthcoming 777x upgrade. For the interior of the A350, Airbus has standardized the use of Stratasys ULTEM material, and it renewed a $15 million materials contract with Hexcel Corp in October 2016.

The aerospace sector’s continued commitment to additive manufacturing will ensure that the industry adapts to the shifting commercial landscape. One example is the recent news that Boeing has set up a new avionics group to make aircraft controls and electronics. The new division is in competition with existing aerospace suppliers including Rockwell Collins Inc, Honeywell International Inc and United Technologies Corp.

Airbus Launches Internal Corruption Probe into Unexplained US$ 19M Payment - OCCRP,"Wed, 20 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9jY3JwLm9yZy9lbi9kYWlseS83MDIwLWFpcmJ1cy1sYXVuY2hlcy1pbnRlcm5hbC1jb3JydXB0aW9uLXByb2JlLWludG8tdW5leHBsYWluZWQtdXMtMTltLXBheW1lbnTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Leaked documents obtained by the paper show how two companies secretly controlled by Airbus engaged in transactions involving €19 million (US$ 22.7m), a large part of which went to a mysterious company via a tax haven.

In 2007, Eolia, a Maltese company that retrofits passenger jets to transport cargo, bought 26% of Avinco Holdings, a Dutch company that sells second-hand aircraft and helicopters. Both firms presented themselves as independent entities without any significant external support from other firms but in reality they were secretly controlled by Airbus, the paper wrote.

Avinco Holdings, founded in 2000, is mainly financed by a UAE businessman who held 14,999 shares through a holding company. Airbus owned only one share through a shell company called Yellow Sun Holdings in the tax haven of Curacao, in the Caribbean.

But according to a secret agreement, Airbus had the right to seize control of Avinco Holdings at any time. In exchange, the UAE businessman received an annual dividend equivalent to 20% of his total investment.

Bank documents show that in 2007 Eolia transferred €19.4m (US$ 23m) to Avinco Holdings with the transaction marked “share purchase Avinco.”

A week later, the holding company paid €16.2m (US$ 19.4m) to the bank account of a Panamanian company called Rochade Consultancy. On the same day, Rochade paid an identical sum to another company, Malana Holding. It’s unclear who owns Malana, or where it is incorporated.

Avinco Holdings recorded the payment to Rochade as an “interim dividend” in internal financial documents. But it's unclear why Rochade, which is not a shareholder, would have the right to any dividend.

Airbus didn’t have an explanation as to why its control of the two companies was concealed and who received the money.

“As part of our ongoing compliance upgrade and investigation into historic business practices within the company, Airbus is determined to uncover any non-compliance and improper practices to ensure that they can never happen again,” the aerospace firm said, according to the Guardian.

“If non-compliance is identified, the company will take all actions necessary to root it out, inform the relevant authorities and ensure those responsible are held accountable.”

Lawyers for Eolia denied that the firm was involved in money laundering and said until recently it had no knowledge of the €16.2m (US$ 19.4m) payment.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999032020568848}",neutral,0.9999032020568848,0

Sepang Aircraft Engineering (SAE) officially opened its second hangar today with a ceremony attended by Dato‘ Sri Ong Ka Chuan, Minister of International Trade and Industry II, Malaysia. The event also celebrated the 10th anniversary of the independent maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) centre.

The 12,000 square metre hangar boosts SAE’s capacity to handle the Airbus A320 Family, and can accommodate two of the aircraft at any time for major maintenance checks. It also features Malaysia’s first eco-friendly closed-door dedicated paint bay, as well as state-of-the-art workshops for the repair and overhaul of a wide range of components used on Airbus aircraft, including hydraulic and pneumatic systems.

Speaking at the event, SAE Chief Executive Officer Pierre Reville said that the second hangar will strengthen and expand the MRO centre’s capabilities.

“As an EASA-approved independent aircraft MRO centre, SAE is able to offer world class maintenance services to airlines from across South East Asia and beyond. The new hangar gives us added flexibility and space to offer more services for our customers,” he said.

“Since we opened in 2007, we have completed 500 C-Checks and established a strong reputation in the MRO market for on-time and reliable service. We are proud of our contribution to the growth of the Malaysian aerospace sector.”

SAE’s first hangar, which opened in 2007, has a floor area of 37,000 square metres and can accommodate up to six single-aisle aircraft or two widebody aircraft at any one time.

In addition to its commercial aircraft activities, SAE provides spare parts and technical support services to the Royal Malaysian Air Force’s fleet of A400M military airlifters. The facility also houses a major regional inventory of spare parts for Airbus A320, A330 and A380 aircraft for airlines that have selected the Airbus Flight Hour Services (FHS) total support package for their fleets.

SAE employs some 500 people. Its customers include the AirAsia Group, Cebu Pacific, Indigo, Jetstar Asia, Scoot, Malindo Air, MASWings, and VietJet Air.

With over 700 aircraft ordered by airlines in the country, Malaysia is Airbus’ third-largest market in the Asia-Pacific region, after China and India. In addition, Airbus has a major industrial presence in the county. Apart from SAE, this includes an engineering design centre at Sepang and an extensive supplier base with Malaysian companies that produce parts for the complete Airbus commercial aircraft product line, as well as for the A400M military transport and H130 helicopter. The value of Airbus work undertaken in the country currently stands at USD 400 million per year, and is set to rise by 25% to USD 500 million by 2021.

Notes for Editors

The 'C’ check is a major scheduled aircraft maintenance check, and is usually performed every 20 months on an A320. It entails an inspection of most of the aircraft’s components, and can take up to two weeks to complete. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) is the regulatory body that certificates Airbus aircraft for commercial service and provides approvals for MRO facilities to undertake work on in-service fleets.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9887209534645081}",neutral,0.9887209534645081,0
Airbus faces large fine in corruption probe: report - Business Insider,"Fri, 15 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vci1haXJidXMtZmFjZXMtbGFyZ2UtZmluZS1pbi1jb3JydXB0aW9uLXByb2JlLXJlcG9ydC0yMDE3LTnSAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL3ItYWlyYnVzLWZhY2VzLWxhcmdlLWZpbmUtaW4tY29ycnVwdGlvbi1wcm9iZS1yZXBvcnQtMjAxNy05P2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS/LONDON (Reuters) - A newspaper said Airbus could face a ""1 billion pound-plus"" fine from British and French prosecutors over corruption allegations, but people familiar with the case said it was premature to talk about a settlement in an inquiry expected to drag on for years.

The London-based Evening Standard reported British and French prosecutors met last month to discuss the terms of a settlement deal known as a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) following a probe into the use of middlemen to sell jetliners.

It quoted a source close to Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) as saying SFO head David Green hoped to agree a DPA with Airbus before leaving his post in April next year. The report comes as the British government considers folding the SFO into another agency.

The SFO and Airbus declined to comment. France's Parquet National Financier (PNF) fraud police were not available to comment.

The investigations began after Airbus drew the attention of regulators to inaccurate declarations it had made to Britain's export credit finance agency over payments to sales agents.

The SFO launched its investigation in August 2016, followed seven months later by the PNF, which legal experts say makes it a relatively young investigation for such a complex case.

Sources familiar with the case said the investigation could last for several years.

Airbus has said the process may be a long one.

Some analysts say the company could face a record fine.

It cannot enter into negotiations over a DPA but can be offered one at the end of official investigations, depending on its level of cooperation. It has embarked on a sweeping internal investigation, hampering sales efforts and fuelling tensions with third parties whose payments have been frozen.

In January, the SFO struck a DPA with Rolls-Royce forcing the company to pay a record 500 million pound ($680 million) fine for a settlement of this type. That followed what was then the SFO's largest ever investigation.

The scope of the Airbus case is widely seen as larger with dozens of sales contracts and over a billion euros worth of business under the spotlight, according to one source.

Airbus is meanwhile preparing to hit back in a row with Austria over allegations of fraud in a fighter deal, which targets individuals including Chief Executive Tom Enders.

The company is expected to issue a defense in coming days and has not ruled out taking the unusual step of legal action against one of its national customers, sources said.

EASA issues emergency AD for H225 - Vertical Mag - Vertical Magazine,"Fri, 29 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvZWFzYS1pc3N1ZXMtZW1lcmdlbmN5LWFkLWgyMjUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has this week issued an emergency airworthiness directive (AD) for the Airbus Helicopters H225 (also known as the EC225 LP in the Super Puma family). It appears not to be linked to the main gearbox problems that have plagued Super Pumas since 2009, the latest causing a fatal crash in April 2016. Nevertheless, it adds weight on Airbus’ shoulders as the aircraft’s return to operations has been slow since October 2016.

Airbus Helicopters has determined that the control rod attachment yokes of the main rotor’s swashplate are susceptible to crack development, EASA said. Due to aging, the phenomenon could lead to structural failure of a yoke, “possibly resulting in loss of control of the helicopter.” Airbus has therefore issued an emergency alert service bulletin, which EASA is referring to in its emergency AD.

For those swashplates more than seven years old, strict inspections must be implemented. The interval between two inspections should not exceed 15 flight hours or seven days, whichever comes first. Then, within 100 flight hours after the effective date of the AD, each yoke area should be stripped, inspected and reworked.

Such an emergency AD for a technical problem is not exceptional. The EASA issued one for the Leonardo AW139 earlier this month. However, this additional technical concern for the H225 is emerging at a time when Airbus is still struggling to regain confidence from operators, especially in the offshore industry.

Last month, Era Group said that “any broad-based return to service . . . will be dependent upon the confidence . . . amongst oil-and-gas companies and the labor unions representing their employees.” Era will not operate the H225 “until we can develop a detailed safety case that demonstrates [it] can be operated safely,” the company said. It owns nine H225s.

Last November, if filed a lawsuit against Airbus Helicopters, alleging breaches of various contracts, fraudulent inducement and unjust enrichment from the sale by Airbus of H225s to the company.

Helioffshore, a safety-focused organization founded by offshore helicopter operators, yesterday said it is “stepping up work on key projects that it has prioritized as having the greatest potential to save lives.” Among the priority projects is “improved system reliability and resilience to eliminate the main causes of safety-critical system failure.”

The impact of the H225’s troubles on the industry will probably be a matter of hot debate this week at the Helitech show in London.

No crack has ever been identified on this part in service, Airbus Helicopters emphasizes. Most H225s qualify for the additional inspections. The first ones in the production run use a yoke made from a different alloy, which is not susceptible to develop cracks, the company says.

Out of a global fleet of 346 civil and military H225s and Super Puma L2s (the two types affected by earlier main gearbox problems), 183 have returned to service.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.539560854434967}",neutral,0.539560854434967,0

Airbus BLADE hopes for cut-through on wing efficiency - Airline Ratings,"Wed, 27 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyYXRpbmdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1ibGFkZS1ob3Blcy1jdXQtd2luZy1lZmZpY2llbmN5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus BLADE project may not have may not have produced the prettiest wing ever designed and it certainly isn’t the work of art gracing the Airbus A350.

But if the Breakthrough Laminar Aircraft Demonstrator in Europe can achieve its aim of reducing wing friction by 50 per cent and carbon dioxide emissions by 5 per cent, it will provide a handy weapon in the fight to reduce aviation’s ecological footprint.

READ: PLane makers face new environmental standards.

Two transonic laminar outer-wings have been attached to Airbus’ A340 Flight Lab in what the manufacturer says is world first and the test aircraft took to the air this week. It will perform around 150 flight hours in the coming months.

Laminar Flow might sound like a name for a progressive rock band but it refers to the state in which a fluid or gas travels smoothly or in regular paths.

On aircraft, this means a smooth airflow over the wings that makes them more aerodynamic and therefore more efficient.

It has been a holy grail of manufacturers but laminar wings have not been used in commercial aviation because the technology up to now was not mature enough and had not been flight tested.

The arrival of new flow simulation tools has given the quest a big boost.

The extensive modifications to the A340-300 test-bed aircraft, which is packed with flight-test instrumentation, were made over the course of 16 months in Tarbes, France, with the support of Airbus industrial partners across Europe.

“We began by opening the flight envelope to check that the aircraft was handling correctly,” said Airbus flight-test engineer Philippe Seve.

“We achieved our objective to fly at the design Mach number, at a reasonable altitude and check everything was fine. We also checked that the flight-test instrumentation) was working as expected, to identify further fine-tuning for the next flights.”

A small team of specially-trained pilots, test engineers and flight test engineers prepared for months prior to the first flight, spending time in a simulator and familiarizing themselves with the flight-test instruments.

Teams from Bremen, Germany and Broughton, UK worked on the outer wings with a team from Stade, Germany, installing infra-red cameras.

Airbus for the first time is using a testing method involving hundreds of points to measure the waviness of the surface to help engineers ascertain its influence on the “laminarity”.

The tests use infrared cameras inside the pod to measure wing temperature, an acoustic generator which measures the influence of acoustics on laminarity and an innovative reflectometry system, which measures overall deformation in real-time during flight.

They aim to be able to measure the tolerances and imperfections which can be present and still sustain laminarity.

“To this end, Airbus will simulate every type of imperfection in a controlled manner, so that at the end of the campaign the tolerances for building a laminar wing will be fully known,’’ the manufacturer said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999005794525146}",neutral,0.9999005794525146,0

United Airlines has increased the number of A350 XWB aircraft it will bring into its fleet, updating and expanding its previously existing order for 35 A350-1000 to 45 A350-900 widebody aircraft to replace older, less efficient aircraft, supporting future growth at the airline.

The A350-900 is the cornerstone member of the A350XWB (Xtra Wide-Body) family, which is shaping the future of air travel. The aircraft typically seats 325 passengers in a standard three-class configuration and features state-of-the-art comfort and amenities, offering an exclusive flight experience to passengers on board with the new Airspace by Airbus cabin. The A350-900’s unique combination of payload and true long-range range capabilities makes it an ideal aircraft for United Airlines’ international route system. These aircraft will be the first Airbus widebodies to join United’s global fleet.

“For the past year, United has done a complete review to ensure that we have the right long-term fleet strategy, and it was clear that the A350 aligns with our replacement needs and our network,” said Andrew Levy, Chief Financial Officer of United Airlines. “The combination of the range performance and efficiencies make the A350 an attractive aircraft for United.”

“This updated and expanded order is a strong reaffirmation of the A350 XWB Family,” said John Leahy, Chief Operating Officer – Customers. “United and Airbus have had a long and strong partnership for many years, and we’ve worked together to ensure their requirements for the future are met, if not exceeded. The airline’s decision to grow its widebody fleet with, for the first time, a widebody model from Airbus, shows they know that the A350 will meet their financial and performance demands, while pleasing their customers who will enjoy the quietest and most comfortable cabin in its class.”

The A350 XWB is the world’s newest and most efficient twin-aisle airliner, featuring the latest aerodynamic design, carbon fiber fuselage and wings, plus new fuel-efficient Rolls-Royce engines. Together, these latest technologies translate into unrivalled levels of operational efficiency, with a 25 percent reduction in fuel burn and emissions, and significantly lower maintenance costs.

The 100th A350 was delivered at the end of July 2017, just some 30 months after the first delivery of the world’s most modern widebody aircraft in December 2014. To date*, Airbus has recorded a total of 848 firm orders for the A350 XWB from 45 customers worldwide.

The Airbus Airspace Cabin Will Debut On jetBlue in 2020: Wins Top Award at APEX Awards - paddleyourownkanoo.com,"Wed, 27 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhZGRsZXlvdXJvd25rYW5vby5jb20vMjAxNy8wOS8yNy9haXJidXMtYWlyc3BhY2UtY2FiaW4td2lsbC1kZWJ1dC1qZXRibHVlLTIwMjAtd2lucy10b3AtYXdhcmQtYXBleC1hd2FyZHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bigger, brighter, better – that’s what pan-European aircraft manufacturer, Airbus is promising with the introduction of its snazzy looking Airspace cabin interior product for A320 model aircraft. The promise is to bring the same kind of features previously reserved just for long-haul aircraft to the short-haul sector.

Of course, the problem with a short-haul, single-aisle aircraft like the A320 won’t come as much of a surprise. The planes are incredibly popular with airline’s but passengers feel like they’re being crammed into a tiny space. The low ceilings and tight spaces don’t do anything to improve the overall passenger experience.

And things are set to get even worse. Now airline’s are managing to cram even more seats into the same space by reducing both the seat pitch (the distance between seats) and the size of the seats themselves. Redesigned galley’s and lavatories under the Space-Flex project will only compound the problem.

So Airbus is addressing the problem head-on – bringing the same design elements that were first launched on its ultra-modern A350 widebody jet to its short-haul aircraft range.

“Airspace offers the kind of features previously reserved for a few long-haul cabins, so bringing that to our best-selling aircraft family is really going to be noticed by airlines and passengers,” explained Airbus’ Dr Kiran Rao at this year’s APEX Expo in Long Beach.

Others clearly agree with Rao. The company won the award for Best Passenger Comfort Innovation at the APEX Awards ceremony, with judges noting the “consistent experience” that customers could now look forward to.

And now we know which airline’s passengers will first get to enjoy the new experience. That airline, it turns out is going to be New York-based low-cost carrier, JetBlue. The first A320neo with the Airspace interior will be delivered to the airline in late 2020.

“The Airspace cabin is aligned with our efforts to create an experience as comfortable as your own living room,” commented Robin Hayes, JetBlue’s president at the unveiling ceremony.

The airline has been a longstanding Airbus customer and now operates a fleet of 176 A320 and stretched A321 aircraft. JetBlue has more than 100 aircraft still on order with Airbus.

So how does Airspace actually make the passenger experience any better? Well, first of all, there’s the redesigned overhead bins – long the single biggest source of customer woe onboard single-aisle aircraft. The Airspace bin, however, is 40% bigger than the old version with the ability to store 8 carry-on bags in the same space that used to only take 5 bags.

And passengers should start feeling the positive effects of Airspace as soon as they board the aircraft, thanks to what Airbus calls “iconic ceiling lighting”. The same effect continues throughout the cabin with coloured LED lighting and a central lighting strip that’s visible even when those huge overhead bins are open.

Airbus has even found a way to make the cabin feel bigger – even if it hasn’t got much roomier at all. That’s achieved with redesigned cabin sidewall panels that add an inch of width at shoulder height. It’s not much but it might be just enough to give passengers a sense of increased personal space.

Then there’s the new window surround – the actual window is no bigger than before but again, it’s all in the design, hoping to give passengers a greater sense of comfort and room.

For the time being, JetBlue is the only Airspace customer but expect more to be announced soon. Airbus also claims the product is fully retrofittable on existing A320 aircraft although how many airlines’s decide to shell out for a full cabin refit remains to be seen.

One more thing, the Airbus Airspace cabin comes seven years after rival, Boeing launched its own new-look cabin interior for its short haul 737 aircraft. The Boeing Sky Interior boasts many of the same benefits of Airspace – including larger overhead bins, sculpted sidewalls and new lighting options.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9797906279563904}",positive,0.9797906279563904,1
U.S. Coast Guard's Airbus Ocean Sentry Fleet Attains - GlobeNewswire,"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbG9iZW5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAxNy8wOS8yMi8xMTMxNjI0LzAvZW4vVS1TLUNvYXN0LUd1YXJkLXMtQWlyYnVzLU9jZWFuLVNlbnRyeS1GbGVldC1BdHRhaW5zLUZsaWdodC1ob3VyLU1pbGVzdG9uZS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MOBILE, Ala., Sept. 22, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- After eight years in service, the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) fleet of 18 Airbus HC-144A Ocean Sentry maritime patrol aircraft has surpassed 100,000 flight hours.



A photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/6d811952-2b2a-4b8a-bb6a-03533f81578c

The flight-hour milestone achievement is a product of the Coast Guard’s dedication to mission performance, but has been made possible by the aircraft’s superior availability and reliability. Airbus and the U.S. Coast Guard commemorated the milestone at the Airbus Defense and Space maintenance, repair and overhaul facility in Mobile, Alabama.

“The Ocean Sentry has provided the U.S. Coast Guard the capability to fly more hours per sortie without having to stop to refuel or complete maintenance,” said Capt. Joe Kimball, Chief of the USCG Office of Aviation Forces. “The ability to stay in the air longer with Ocean Sentry has allowed us to increase the effectiveness of our Aviation Assets responding to Coast Guard missions.”

While in service with the USCG, the HC-144A has been involved in 3,500 search and rescue missions saving 620 lives, and supported 8,400 law enforcement missions, including 890 drug interdiction missions. It also played a response role during the recent hurricanes Harvey and Irma.

""Mobile is proud to be a U.S. Coast Guard city, and it was my pleasure to congratulate them on 100,000 life-saving flight hours with the HC-144,” said Mobile Mayor Sandy Stimpson. “We're proud of our relationship with the Coast Guard and Airbus and the great work they do in Mobile.""

Airbus Defense and Space offers comprehensive maintenance, repair and overhaul services, professional engineering and technical support for the aircraft in Mobile.

“Being here in the Gulf Coast, we get to witness every day the continuous support the Coast Guard provides to our region and worldwide across a range of demanding missions,” said Stephan Miegel, Head of Military Aircraft Services, Airbus Defence and Space. “We take a lot of pride watching the Ocean Sentries taking off every day just across the flight line from us.”

The current fleet of Ocean Sentry aircraft operates out of Coast Guard Air Stations in Cape Cod, Mass.; Mobile, Ala.; Corpus Christi, Texas; and Miami. By the year 2022, the fleet is expected to reach 200,000 flight hours.

German Federal Aviation Office certifies world's first H145 full flight simulator at Airbus Helicopters - Airbus,"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNy0wOS1nZXJtYW4tZmVkZXJhbC1hdmlhdGlvbi1vZmZpY2UtY2VydGlmaWVzLXdvcmxkcy1maXJzdC1oMTQ1LWZ1bGzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Donauwörth, The H145 simulator at the Airbus Helicopters Training Academy in Germany has been awarded level D status by the German Federal Aviation Office – the highest possible certification for a full flight simulator. With such airworthiness authority approval, more training hours accumulated by pilots in the full flight simulator are now authorized to be logged as actual flight hours.

The simulator provides national and international customers with a wide range of training opportunities, in particular for missions under extreme flight conditions and for practising various emergency procedures. Not only is it the world’s first certified full flight simulator for the H145, but it is also the first helicopter simulator in Germany to receive EASA level D certification. Level D helicopter simulators must meet a number of criteria, including the ability to move in six directions, to provide a field of view of at least 180°, to work with realistic acoustic and visual simulations, and to perform several special motion effects. The new simulator in Donauwörth fulfils and partially exceeds the requirements.

An additional important feature of the new simulator is that it can accommodate developments that are still on the horizon: the simulator cockpit developed and constructed in-house by Airbus Helicopters can be easily rolled on and off the simulator, allowing it to be replaced with other configurations. This guarantees maximum flexibility with regards to future helicopter variants or configurations.

The H145 simulator is suitable for pilots’ initial training and refresher courses, for specific instruction on emergency procedures, for flights according to Instrument Flight Rules (IFR), in offshore conditions and at night (with night vision goggles), as well as for Cat. A operations. Each year, more than 400 pilots pass through the Training Academy in Donauwörth, completing over 1,500 flight hours in the process.

“Thanks to the world’s first H145 simulator, we can provide our customers with an excellent training environment,” explains Charles Hebeka, Head of Airbus Helicopters Training Centres in Germany. “This is a further step we are taking together with our customers towards guaranteeing maximum flight safety when operating our helicopters.”

In order to make the H145 flight simulation as realistic as possible, the simulator is provided with an extensive H145 OEM level D data package from Airbus Helicopters and its suppliers. This includes H145 software, an original cockpit and further H145 parts, all of which guarantee the fully simulated and realistic functionality of the helicopter, its engines and the Helionix avionics suite. Furthermore, the simulator has been tested and validated by the design experts, flight test engineers and test pilots who were involved in the development of the H145. It has been built in cooperation with Indra Systemas, a Spanish flight simulator manufacturer.

Cathay Pacific prefers slimmer version of Airbus A350 aircraft - South China Morning Post,"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjbXAuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2NvbXBhbmllcy9hcnRpY2xlLzIxMTExODEvY2F0aGF5LXBhY2lmaWMtY2FzdHMtZXllLWEzNTBzLXNsaW1tZXItc2libGluZy10cmlwcy1haXJidXPSAXNodHRwczovL2FtcC5zY21wLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9jb21wYW5pZXMvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMTExMTgxL2NhdGhheS1wYWNpZmljLWNhc3RzLWV5ZS1hMzUwcy1zbGltbWVyLXNpYmxpbmctdHJpcHMtYWlyYnVz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For Cathay, which is cutting costs to help revive earnings, the switch could save about $288 million, based on list prices.

The Cathay decision narrows the order book for the 366-seat A350-1000 to 171 aircraft, based on the planemaker’s latest data, while lifting the backlog for the 325-berth -900 to 679 planes. The larger jetliner is falling out of favour as carriers around the world rein in capacity expansion to ease pressure on fares, while United Chief Financial Officer Andrew Levy said the -1000 is also too close in size to the largest Boeing Co. 777 model.

The model switch, announced by Asia’s biggest international carrier on Wednesday, follows a decision last week at United Airlines to swap on order for 35 A350-1000s to 45 -900s, a move that increased the overall value of the deal but took a large bite out of the bigger jet’s backlog.

Airbus SE’s newest widebody jet lost more orders as Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. switched a contract for six A350-1000s to the smaller -900 variant and deferred delivery of five more by a year.

The order revisions suggest that the sweet spot for twin-engined widebody orders remains in the 250-350 seat range at a time of excess capacity and with the low oil price making it possible for carriers to put off fleet renewal and upgrades, aerospace consultant Richard Aboulafia said.

Cathay Pacific didn’t give a reason for the A350 flip, announced as part of an order for 32 A321neo planes, saying only that the move would save it US$288 million. The Hong Kong carrier has altered course on the A350 before, having ordered 30 -900s in 2010 before two years later switching 16 to -1000s and placing a separate US$3.3 billion order for 10 more of the larger aircraft.

All told, Cathay is now due to take 26 -900s -- of which 16 have been handed over -- and 20 -1000s. The five deferred -1000s will be pushed back by a year to arrive from 2021.

Airbus said that the A350-1000 is complementary to the -900 and part of a successful family that has accrued 848 firm orders from 45 customers spanning seven years of production. Switches between models aren’t a major issue since all stations on the A350 final assembly line can accommodate both models, as can tooling and personnel, spokesman Stefan Schaffrath said in an email. He added that past experience shows that aircraft sizes within a model series increase over time and that Airbus is “very bullish” about the A350 line-up.

A handout picture provided by Airbus on 15 June 2015 shows an Airbus A350 XWB airplane during the Paris Air Show 2015, at Le Bourget airport, in Paris, France. Photo: EPA The fortunes of the A350-1000, which had its maiden flight on Nov. 24. 2016, are stuttering even before its first delivery, scheduled to be to Qatar Airways before the end of this year.

Qatar Air is also the largest customer for the plane, with 37 on order. United was set to be the second-biggest operator before its exit, leaving Abu Dhabi’s Etihad Airways PJSC ranked next on 22 aircraft, though the Persian Gulf company is reviewing its business model after a $1.87 billion loss in 2016 and bankruptcy filings at two carriers in which it held stakes.

Cathay’s remaining 20 orders will make it the No. 3 customer, followed by IAG SA’s British Airways and Iran Air, which are scheduled to take 18 and 16 aircraft respectively. Dubai-based Emirates was also a major -1000 buyer with 20 orders before it scrapped the deal in 2014, along with one for 50 -900s.

Airbus abandoned the smallest A350-800 variant, which would have carried 280 people, in 2014 as airlines embraced bigger twin jets. As recently as January the company said it was stepping up work on a stretched version of the -1000 carrying 396 people in three classes to challenge the sales success of the biggest version of the Boeing Co. 777X series due at the end of the decade. It has since shelved that plan.

A winglet of the Airbus A350 XWB flight-test aircraft is pictured during a media day event at Guarulhos airport in Sao Paulo August 7, 2014. Photo: Reuters The European manufacturer will be anxious that the A350’s travails stop with the -1000; as part of United’s restructured deal the handover of the smaller -900s won’t now begin until 2022, years later than planned. At the same time the retention of the order earmarks the A350 as a preferred replacement for the current generation 777, for which United was the launch customer in 1995, with Boeing yet to secure a North American contract for the 777X.

In December 2013, Cathay ordered 21 of the larger -9 version of Boeing’s 777X for US$7.5 billion at list price, becoming the first Asian carrier to sign up for the new jet. Deliveries of the planes will run from 2021 through 2024.

Delta Air Lines Inc. also said in May it would defer 10 orders for the A350-900 due in 2019 and 2020 by two to three years and instead take a stretched version of Airbus’s A320 single-aisle workhorse in the near term, while American Airlines Group Inc. has postponed deliveries of 22 -900s.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9870879650115967}",neutral,0.9870879650115967,0
"Delta’s state-of-the-art flagship touches down in Denver, but no local flights planned (for now) - The Denver Post","Tue, 26 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbnZlcnBvc3QuY29tLzIwMTcvMDkvMjYvZGVsdGEtYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtOTAwLWRlbnZlci_SAUdodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZW52ZXJwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDE3LzA5LzI2L2RlbHRhLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLTkwMC1kZW52ZXIvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Delta’s new, state-of-the-art flagship made waves when it was spotted on the runway at Denver International Airport Tuesday morning.

The Airbus A350-900 sighting, which was promoted for “av geeks” (or aviation enthusiasts) with a trio of photo tweets from DIA officials, marks the first time the A350-900 has appeared in Colorado.

“The A350 has been conducting training flights for the last month or so,” Michael Thomas, manager of corporate communications for Delta Air Lines, wrote in an email. “This week, as part of the certification prior to entering revenue service, the A350 was flow to unique airports — in this case Denver for its high altitude. We’ll also be flying to Seattle and San Francisco.”

While no Denver-centric routes are planned for the widebody commercial jet just yet, Delta will officially debut the plane on Oct. 30 with a route from Detroit to Tokyo’s Narita International Airport, marking the first time the A350 has flown passengers for a North American carrier.

“I think there’s always the possibility,” a Delta spokesman said of a Denver route.

The industry excitement over the A350 stems from features Delta touts as “the future of international travel,” such as a lightweight, composite body that allow for longer-range flights, better fuel efficiency, lower operating costs and reduced noise and emissions.

When it debuted for Qatar Airways in 2015, the A350 represented a step up from Boeing’s 787, according to Aviation Week, with nine-abreast economy seating that can fly 315 passengers 7,750 nautical miles at Mach 0.85 — compared with the 787-9’s 280-person capacity and a maximum range of 8,300 nautical miles.

Delta will take delivery of five A350s this year, with more coming in 2018, to replace its retiring widebody aircraft, the company said.

Delta is also hoping an improved customer experience will draw travelers to the plane, as the A350 will be Delta’s first to feature Delta One Suite, “the world’s first business class cabin to feature a sliding door,” and Delta Premium Select, “a new premium economy experience.”

The A350 offers 32 seats in the Delta One cabin, 48 seats in Delta Premium Select and 226 seats in the main cabin. Customers in all cabins will have access to high-speed 2Ku Wi-Fi internet with speeds that support streaming video and work-related VPN networks.

“A modern cabin environment will also be outfitted on Delta’s A350 with high capacity overhead bins, full spectrum LED ambient lighting and in-seat, in-flight entertainment at every seat,” according to a Delta press statement.

Delta’s first A350 arrived at the airline’s hub in Atlanta in August, following multiple test flights in May and June, and six-month assembly and ground-testing period in Toulouse, France.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9990799427032471}",neutral,0.9990799427032471,0

PETERSBURG — So long, MD-80s. Budget airline Allegiant Air has replaced all of their aging planes at St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport with Airbus models as of August, scrapping its current local fleet.

Allegiant is the predominant carrier at the airport, flying 382 routes across the country.

""Moving to a single fleet-type will create operating efficiencies across our entire operation, from crew training to scheduling,"" Hilarie Grey, spokesperson for Allegiant, said in an email.

Grey said passengers are likely to see ""other aircraft types"" throughout the transition, however.

The move is part of a larger plan to replace the company's MD-80 planes by 2019, which are inefficient in terms of gas mileage and prone to mechanical problems. The average age of the planes is about 26 years.

A Tampa Bay Times investigation in October 2016 found that mechanical issues made Allegiant four times more likely to have unscheduled landings than other airlines in 2015.

Airbus 320s average about $98 million each, though Allegiant may have negotiated a bulk price. The airline committed in late 2016 to buying 12 Airbus planes. It did not disclose the final price.

Allegiant's Las Vegas-basedparent company, Allegiant Travel Co., posted $400 million in revenue for the second quarter of 2017, a 16 percent increase from the same quarter last year.

United Technologies merges with Rockwell Collins - The Economist,"Sat, 09 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb25vbWlzdC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAxNy8wOS8wOS91bml0ZWQtdGVjaG5vbG9naWVzLW1lcmdlcy13aXRoLXJvY2t3ZWxsLWNvbGxpbnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WHEN passengers board an aircraft, only a few care whether it was built by Airbus or Boeing, two giants that make all the world’s big airliners. Fewer still would recognise the names of the thousands of suppliers that produce the 2m or so parts that go into a modern jet. Surprisingly little of the work is done by Boeing and Airbus. Boeing has outsourced 70% of the parts for its 787 aircraft. The job of assembling Airbus’s A380 superjumbo in its Toulouse factory accounts for only 4% of the work required to make it. The balance of power between aerospace firms and their suppliers is causing ructions.

Near hostilities have broken out due to a run of big mergers among parts-makers. On September 4th, United Technologies (UTC), an American conglomerate that makes Pratt & Whitney engines and other aerospace parts, announced that it had agreed to buy Rockwell Collins, an avionics firm, for $30bn. Although it is one of the biggest-ever mergers in the aerospace business, the deal is just the latest in a series of supplier tie-ups this year. In April, Rockwell Collins itself bought B/E Aerospace, a cabin-interiors specialist, for $8.6bn. Two months later Safran, a French maker of engines and landing gear, agreed to buy Zodiac, a specialist in aircraft seats, for $7.7bn.

As usual, the firms’ bosses pledge that synergies between the businesses will help fund the deals. UTC wants its merger with Rockwell to produce $500m in savings, according to its chief executive, Greg Hayes. But the imperative behind these supplier tie-ups lies elsewhere, in the oodles of profit they make from planemakers. In the past two years, suppliers made profit margins of between 14% and 17%, compared with 9% for planemakers. The main reason for the divergence is that the huge development costs associated with jetliner programmes are borne by planemakers, not their suppliers. And assembling parts is a relatively low value-added activity.

Confronted with a shrinking number of new orders, as well as pressure from investors, both Airbus and Boeing are adopting a more aggressive stance towards the suppliers. This means trying to push them into offering much lower prices today, in return for future contracts. But that is not all. By outsourcing the most complex parts of their aircraft, Airbus and Boeing lost control of what turned out to be a highly lucrative market for servicing aircraft, with airlines as customers. Rolls-Royce, a British engine-maker, makes half its sales and all its profits from servicing engines. The pair want this market back if possible. They are trying to make more parts in-house. In July, Boeing set up an avionics subsidiary to make more of its electrical systems itself. Airbus is cutting back its list of suppliers and doing more of its own work.

It is in response to this assault that the supply chain is consolidating, says Jim Harris of Bain & Company, a consultancy. Gaining scale gives suppliers clout with their customers and with their own supply chains. The merged UTC and Rockwell will have annual revenues of $62bn, not far off Airbus at $80bn and Boeing at $96bn.

Unsurprisingly, Boeing has hit the roof about UTC’s acquisition of Rockwell, and has threatened to lobby regulators to stop the deal on competition grounds. Nor is Airbus happy, particularly as problems with Pratt & Whitney’s engines are holding up the delivery of dozens of its jets. It worries that a merger will distract UTC from resolving the problem. It is rare to see two firms that have long battled each other team up on the same side, but there is little doubt, according to an adviser to Boeing and Airbus, that they both “have the knives out for their suppliers”.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995964169502258}",neutral,0.9995964169502258,0

This investment in the new Airbus aircraft marks a major milestone for the still-young boutique airline, revealing stable growth and progressive future development. Due for delivery in 2019, the thoroughly modern, efficient and eco-friendly A321neos will take La Compagnie’s in-flight business-class experience to new heights with the latest technologies, Wi-Fi service and “full-flat” beds, ensuring passengers are well-connected and well-rested upon arrival in New York or Paris.

“Since joining forces with XL Airways in 2016, we have progressively focused on optimizing our performance across all fronts,” said Laurent Magnin, CEO of La Compagnie. “This year alone, La Compagnie has flown over 40,000 passengers, in which sixty percent were from the US and twenty-five percent frequent fliers. The purchase of two new Airbus A321neos, which are more in line with industry standards than our current fleet of Boeing 757s, is an important step in maintaining our unique position in the market as we continue to invest in our clients and evolve as a brand.”

The choice of the French aeronautical firm Airbus, which is headquartered in Blagnac and has manufacturing facilities across Europe and around the world, strengthens La Compagnie’s “French-in-spirit” philosophy that has made the carrier so desirable for intercontinental passengers.

“I’ve always been an advocate for the French industry,” said Magnin. “By selecting Airbus and its A321neo, we are able to illuminate our French touch while reinventing the La Compagnie experience. I am very proud to be the first French airline to employ this particular aircraft.”

The two Airbus A321neos will be introduced to the La Compagnie fleet in 2019 with a full business-class configuration and the most attractive fares on the market.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999082088470459}",positive,0.9999082088470459,1
ANALYSIS: Airbus readies laminar-winged A340 for test flights - Flightglobal,"Mon, 04 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYW5hbHlzaXMvYW5hbHlzaXMtYWlyYnVzLXJlYWRpZXMtbGFtaW5hci13aW5nZWQtYTM0MC1mb3ItdGVzdC1mbGlnaHRzLzEyNTI2MC5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus intends to later this month start flight-testing an A340 that has been fitted with experimental laminar-flow wing sections under a partially EU-funded technology project with other industrial partners and research institutes.

The objective of the effort, dubbed Breakthrough Laminar Aircraft Demonstrator in Europe (BLADE), is to assess the industrial feasibility of natural laminar-flow wings – as opposed to hybrid laminar flow, which is artificially induced through hardware in the wings – on future aircraft. The theory and potential benefits of achieving a laminar rather than turbulent airflow in the boundary layer around the wings have been known for 20 years, said Axel Flaig, senior vice-president research and technology for Airbus's commercial aircraft division, on 30 August in Tarbes, where the A340 has been modified.

But Flaig notes that the technology has so far not been practically applied, because it has not been possible to produce on an industrial scale wings that are, firstly, smooth enough to achieve a laminar airflow and, secondly, aerodynamically robust enough to sustain the desired effect in daily airline operations.

Gaps and steps – especially around conventional, retractable slats along a wing's leading edge – fasteners, surface deformations and contamination through dirt, de-icing fluid and rain droplets can disturb the laminar air flow. ""To make this happen you need very low [design and manufacturing] tolerances,"" says Flaig. ""And you need to make this wing robust against contamination... because this laminar boundary is very sensitive to small disturbances.""

NEW WINGS

On the A340-300 – MSN 001, the first A340 to fly in October 1991 – Airbus replaced the entire wing section outside the outboard engines with a laminar-flow section that has a different geometry and, crucially, a shallower sweep, giving the aircraft a distinctive kinked-wing planform. The wingtips have been fitted with pods containing sensors, including video cameras. And the attachment structure to the A340's existing wing has also been covered by fairings to accommodate further sensors and separate the air over the laminar-flow section from that across the conventional wing.

The new wing section contains no fuel system, but is otherwise fully functional and includes the aircraft's two ailerons on each side. The interior structure is metallic, while the upper wing surface – where laminar flow is to be achieved – is made from carbonfibre-reinforced plastic.

Airbus

Different construction techniques were employed for the leading edge and upper wing skin to assess feasibility of different manufacturing approaches. On the port wing, the leading edge is integrated with the upper wing surface in a single D-nose carbonfibre panel – provided by Swedish programme partner Saab – which is equipped with internal attachment points to avoid any external fasteners from the leading edge to just forward of the ailerons.

On the starboard side, a metallic leading edge is joined with a carbonfibre upper wing surface supplied by UK composites specialist GKN. Flaig describes the port side as a more ""elegant"" solution, but expresses hope that the starboard side will fulfil aerodynamic requirements as the more conventional construction is less demanding and costly to manufacture.

The laminar-wing sections are not equipped with slats, and the slats on the remaining conventional wing have been deactivated. This will reduce the A340's capability to operate at high pitch-up angles, and speeds for take-off and landing will be higher than usual, acknowledges Flaig. But he says this will pose no problem as the aircraft, which has a maximum take-off weight of 275t, will not weigh more than 150t for test flights.

Part of the effort will be to assess a Kruger flap for the laminar-flow wing – to provide both high lift for take-off and landing, and leading-edge shielding. The team will install a fixed Kruger flap approximately 2m (6ft 6in) in length on a section of the laminar wing, and remove the device for high-speed tests. Additionally, coatings are being evaluated to reduce wing contamination, especially by insects.

FUTURE APPLICATION

Airbus insists ""there is no link to any possible future aircraft programme"". However, the natural laminar-flow tests are clearly aimed at maturing technology for a potential next-generation narrowbody. While the A340's wing has a sweep of approximately 30°, which is linked to achieving a cruise speed of Mach 0.82-0.84 for long-haul flights, the laminar wing has a sweep of around 20°. Airbus says the test aerofoil is optimised for cruising at Mach 0.75.

""Natural laminar-flow at a 30° sweep angle is impossible because of the instability of the flow,"" Airbus's flight-lab project leader Thierry Fol tells FlightGlobal. ""You have to make a decision: either you would like to have natural laminar flow so you have to slow down in order to have a less important sweep angle... or you keep the 30° [sweep] in order to fly at Mach 0.85, but have something to stabilise the turbulent flow.""

Fol says high-speed flight would require a hybrid laminar-flow system that produces a suction effect around perforated wing surface areas. The required low pressure could either be produced by redirecting air inside the aerofoils (passive system) or through an active pump system.

Flaig acknowledges that a speed reduction to Mach 0.75 would not be acceptable for long-haul and that aircraft designers would have to adopt a hybrid laminar-flow system. But he argues that speed could be compromised on short- to medium-haul routes as A320-family aircraft typically cruise at Mach 0.78. ""We think it doesn't make a big difference,"" he says.

FlightGlobal

While the boundary airflow on conventional wings tends to become turbulent just aft of the leading edge, the BLADE's objective is to achieve laminar flow along 50% of chord length. Wing friction drag could thus be halved, says Flaig. Based on an 800nm (1,480km) sector, this could translate to an overall aircraft drag reduction by 8% and fuel burn savings of up to 5%, he says.

A central aspect of the research is to find a sweet spot between potential savings and a sufficiently robust laminar flow that can be sustained in daily operations. As natural wing flexing can break up the laminar flow, the team wants to determine how much movement can be tolerated before the flow becomes turbulent.

INFRARED AND REFLECTOMETRY

In order to measure the wing's flexibility, the fairing around the old and new wing joint has been finished with a stripe pattern. A set of eight video cameras in each of the two wing-tip pods is monitoring the pattern and its reflection on the laminar wing's surface to determine the aerofoils' movement. This is being combined with data from interior sensors on the wing spar to assess the structure's movement.

Meanwhile, infrared cameras on top of the vertical tail fin are monitoring the laminar flow over the wing. BLADE project leader Daniel Kierbel explains that the laminar flow area can be visualised as the flow cools the wing's surface – which is being warmed by sunlight – at a slower rate than turbulent air. He adds that flight tests will need to be interrupted in October as the sun will be at too low an angle during winter to sufficiently warm the wing.

FlightGlobal

The BLADE A340 will be based in Toulouse, and no missions are planned outside the region. The team intends to complete a total of around 150 flight hours this year and in 2018. Flight-test engineer Philippe Seve says the A340 will be ""a bizarre aircraft to fly"" as its original wing is a 1980s design, while the outer, approximately 9m section has a more radical, new design. The flight-test programme – a first sortie is targeted for second half of September – will concentrate on aircraft handling, and then move on to laminar flow evaluations.

At a later stage, Seve says the team wants to ""alter the wing"" in order to assess the laminar flow's robustness. There is no intention to damage the wing. But tests will include application of stickers to simulate gaps, steps and surface deformations around rivets. On one side, Airbus has installed a speaker system to gauge potential effects of engine noise on the laminar flow.

IDEAL TESTBED

Seve says the A340 provides an optimal testbed as its legacy wing provides stability and safety if lift were to be compromised on the laminar section. ""We will be able to do whatever we want,"" he says. ""It's better to have a test wing that doesn't alter the full physics of the wing"".

During the early planning phase – the BLADE project was launched in 2008 as part of the Smart Fixed-Wing Aircraft initiative under Europe's CleanSky research effort – there were evaluations to use a smaller aircraft, reveals Flaig. He says this approach would have necessitated building a complete new wing and would have been ""very expensive"". Airbus's initial A340 flight-test aircraft lent itself because ""it was available"" – the need to use the aircraft for routine technical assessments has declined as the active A340 fleet is shrinking – and the four-engined type's wing configuration provided a ""natural junction"" to attach a full-scale laminar wing section. Meanwhile, the rest of the wing – including attachments for the engines and landing gear, fuel system, trailing-edge flaps – can remain unchanged.

""This is a significantly less technical effort, but will demonstrate the same and be much more safe, because... if something happens on the aerodynamic side, the rest of the wings will still be carrying the aircraft,"" says Flaig.

He says the BLADE project represents the largest part of Airbus's estimated €330 million ($392 million) contribution to the EU's current Clean Sky II initiative – a 10-year programme until 2024 that includes other projects to mature technology for more efficient aero engines, helicopters and onboard systems. Some 20 other contributors are involved in the BLADE scheme, including Dassault, Romania's Romaero – whose responsibility included production of the wing-tip pods – and Spanish aerostructures specialist Aernnova, which assembled the two laminar wing sections.

Clean Sky II's estimated total gross budget is €4.2 billion, half of which is funded by the EU. Flaig concedes that Airbus on its own would not be able to pursue an undertaking such as BLADE.

Exclusive - Resurgent THY talks jets with Airbus after Boeing deal - Yahoo Movies UK,"Fri, 22 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vdWsubW92aWVzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9tb3ZpZXMvYm9laW5nLWRlYWwtdHVya2lzaC1haXJsaW5lcy13ZWlnaHMtYWlyYnVzLW9yZGVyLXNvdXJjZXMtMTA1NDUwOTU5LS1maW5hbmNlLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Tim Hepher PARIS (Reuters) - Turkish Airlines has begun talks with Airbus to buy up to 40 A350 jetliners worth $12.4 billion (£9.15 billion) at list prices, hours after outlining a similar deal with rival planemaker Boeing, people familiar with the airline said on Friday. The carrier's first significant moves on expansion since last year's failed Turkish coup appear designed to signal a rebound coinciding with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's visit to the United Nations, though no deals have yet been finalised. In New York, where Erdogan this week attended the U.N. General Assembly, Boeing said on Thursday Turkish Airlines (THY) intended to buy 40 of its 787-9 Dreamliner jets worth $11 billion at list prices. Boeing and the Turkish government also announced a joint initiative to support the Turkish aerospace industry. ""During the talks to finalise the order, we are strictly evaluating the $1 billion worth business volume for the local Turkish supplier industry,"" Turkish Airlines Chairman Ilker Aycı said in a statement on Friday. Hours after the Boeing announcement, attention switched behind the scenes to Boeing's arch-rival Airbus as Turkish Airlines also sought prices from the European planemaker for up to 40 wide-body A350-900 jets, the people said. It was not immediately clear whether this might lead to a separate order or clash with the 787 talks or even be just a case of THY checking Boeing's prices against Airbus's. But THY typically maintains a balanced fleet from the rival planemakers and analysts said the diplomatic setting and wider industrial agreement suggested the Boeing deal was likely to go ahead. That deal came as U.S. President Donald Trump praised Erdogan as a friend, despite tensions between the two countries over Turkish security officials involved in street fighting with protesters during a visit to Washington in May. But the timing and nature of the U.S. deal were unexpected. THY had previously expressed interest in the larger 777X. Both Boeing and Airbus declined to comment on discussions with the airline. THY was not available for comment. THY is growing quickly to compete with Gulf carriers but diplomats say it also has a history of making political points with airplane deals as well as using new routes to project Turkey's 'soft power' abroad. In the past, it has tied abortive talks to buy the Airbus A380 to European Union accession talks, according to industry sources and cables released by Wikileaks. Industry sources said the latest separate discussions with Boeing and Airbus appeared to have been accelerated to fit this week's diplomatic schedule, with no visible tendering process. ""There are politics involved,"" one industry source said. Aircraft negotiations often take months, even years, and are usually kept under wraps until there is at least a preliminary agreement. Follow-up talks with each side may take some time. ""Turkish Airlines intends to buy 40 787-9 aircraft. However, it has not actually ordered the aircraft, so we’re not sure that this is really an announcement at all,"" Robert Stallard, aerospace analyst at Vertical Research Partners, said in a note. THY's passenger numbers were hit by last year's coup attempt, as well as security concerns and tensions with Russia, prompting the airline to postpone Airbus and Boeing deliveries. Passenger numbers grew 6.1 percent between January and August.

United Continental Buys More A350s: What It Means for Boeing and Airbus - Madison.com,"Mon, 25 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFodHRwczovL21hZGlzb24uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2ludmVzdG1lbnQvbWFya2V0cy1hbmQtc3RvY2tzL3VuaXRlZC1jb250aW5lbnRhbC1idXlzLW1vcmUtYTM1MHMtd2hhdC1pdC1tZWFucy1mb3ItYm9laW5nLWFuZC1haXJidXMvYXJ0aWNsZV9mNjAzYmJkZi00Mjc4LTVhNTYtYTg0MC1lM2Y1MGRmOTZmNDIuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In early September, United Continental (NYSE: UAL) announced a long-anticipated change to its Airbus (NASDAQOTH: EADSY) A350 order book. United deferred its A350 orders by several years and switched to the base A350-900 model from the larger A350-1000 variant. However, it increased the total size of its order from 35 units to 45 units.

This news was upstaged by a massive cut to United's earnings guidance contained in the same investor presentation. However, it has big implications for Airbus and Boeing (NYSE: BA). Let's look at what United's updated plans mean for the two aerospace giants.

United's Boeing 747 replacement plans shift

United Airlines first decided to order the A350 way back in 2009. Early the following year, it placed a firm order for 25 A350-900s, with deliveries scheduled to run from 2016 to 2019. These planes were meant to be an eventual replacement for the largest aircraft type in United's fleet: the Boeing 747.

In June 2013, United Continental deferred its A350 deliveries by about two years. It also converted the order to the larger A350-1000 model and ordered another 10 units, bringing the total to 35 A350-1000s. This change made sense, insofar as the A350-1000 is closer in size to the Boeing 747 than the A350-900.

However, in 2015, United Continental began to order the Boeing 777-300ER, which is similar to the A350-1000 in capacity. It now has 18 total orders for the 777-300ER, most of which have already been delivered.

Initially, United had planned to use the 777-300ER to replace smaller widebodies on popular routes, particularly from capacity-constrained Newark International Airport. More recently, it changed that mission, after recognizing that many international routes are already suffering from overcapacity. Instead, the 777-300ER has been serving as a direct replacement for United's aging 747s -- the last of which will be retired later this year.

A new role for the A350 at United

For the past year, new United Continental CFO Andrew Levy has been hinting that the company might want to dump its A350-1000 orders in favor of buying a smaller plane. That's exactly what it just did by converting back to the A350-900 model that United had ordered originally.

United now has a different role in mind for the A350: replacing its fleet of 55 Boeing 777-200ERs, most of which were built between 1997 and 2002. The A350-900 is very similar in size to the 777-200ER and has even more range. To facilitate this new mission, United has deferred its first A350 delivery all the way to 2022.

What it means for Airbus

An outright cancellation of United's A350 order clearly would have been bad news for Airbus. By contrast, the deferral is not a big problem, as Airbus is already nearly sold out for the A350 over the next several years. Indeed, the 35 deferred aircraft and the order for 10 more will help Airbus build up its A350 backlog for the mid-2020s. Most importantly, it means Airbus has beaten Boeing in the competition to replace United's 777-200ERs.

On the other hand, United's order change is another blow to the A350-1000, which hasn't been selling well. The backlog for Airbus's largest A350 variant will fall from 212 units to 177. This situation makes it even less likely that Airbus will ever be able to challenge Boeing's 777-9 with an even larger A350 model.

There's also another missed opportunity here for Airbus to build up a backlog for its A330neo model. In theory, the A330neo represents an attractive value proposition, providing most of the fuel-efficiency benefits of a state-of-the-art widebody at a much lower cost. Yet Airbus has only 210 firm orders for the A330neo, with less than a year remaining before the first delivery. Furthermore, Delta Air Lines is still the only premier airline that has ordered the A330neo.

What it means for Boeing

United's latest A350 order modification is a blow to Boeing, which had seemed to be in a good position to meet the carrier's 777-200ER replacement needs with its 787-9 and 787-10 models. United could still opt to buy more 787s for future growth or to replace a small proportion of its older 777s, but Airbus is getting the bulk of the 777 replacement business.

That said, United Continental has already helped Boeing out by ordering 18 777-300ERs when demand for that model had cratered.

Furthermore, United's decision to stick with the A350 rather than buying some A330neos means it still needs a replacement for its Boeing 767s, as well as its transatlantic Boeing 757s. This is exactly the market segment that Boeing hopes to target with an all-new ""middle of the market"" jet. Thus, while Airbus has won an important deal, Boeing still has a big sales opportunity ahead at United Airlines.

ANALYSIS: The A380's rollercoaster ride in 10 years of service - Flightglobal,"Tue, 19 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYW5hbHlzaXMvYW5hbHlzaXMtdGhlLWEzODBzLXJvbGxlcmNvYXN0ZXItcmlkZS1pbi0xMC15ZWFycy1vZi1zZXJ2aWNlLzEyNTI3My5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Since the Airbus A380 made its world debut with Singapore Airlines a decade ago, the double-decker has gone on to establish itself as the flagship of the fleet at every one of its 13 operators. Airbus has delivered some 215 aircraft and is rightly proud of the game-changing passenger experience that the A380 has brought to air travel.

But unfortunately the A380 story doesn't end there. Airbus has spent the past 10 years trying to convert the big jet's size, unrivalled passenger experience and operating-cost benefits into a solid sales story with little of the success it feels it deserves.

The A380 was launched with the intention of overhauling and supplanting the Boeing 747 as the industry’s queen of the skies, but after a strong start sales have dwindled and production rates are being slashed. Hence, 20th-century assumptions about the unparalleled benefits of the A380's size and economics have been called into question amid the changing market dynamics of the 21st century.

IAG chief executive Willie Walsh summed up the A380's situation in an interview with FlightGlobal last year, when he revealed that the airline could be interested in adding a few incremental units. ""Customers love it. The aircraft works very well,"" said Walsh, but he cautioned that the second-hand market was the most likely source as the price of a new A380 was ""outrageous"".

While Emirates was the first to sign for the A380 (and has now ordered 142), it was SIA that took delivery of the first aircraft, with 9V-SKA arriving on 12 October 2007. SIA flew the inaugural A380 service 12 days later to Sydney. Unfortunately for Airbus, the 10-year milestone is coinciding with that first A380 being retired by SIA and returned to its lessor. While the airline has five more A380s on order, it has chosen to roll over its older aircraft rather than expand its fleet.

Since launching the A380 in December 2000, Airbus has accumulated a total of 317 orders from 18 customers. However, it has lost more than a few orders along the way, including the entire 27-strong orderbook for the A380 Freighter when Airbus was forced to terminate that programme in 2007.

But 10 years in, the A380 has achieved one of its objectives: the in-service fleet is just overtaking that of the 747 passenger variants as the number of the original Jumbo Jet in operation declines towards 200 aircraft.

""Airbus has indeed succeeded in removing the 747 as a competing passenger aircraft,"" says Richard Evans, senior consultant at Flight Ascend Consultancy. ""However, the future market-share battle seems to have shifted to large single-aisles and 300-seat twin-aisles.""

Flight Fleets Analyzer shows that the 747 passenger fleet has steadily declined from about 740 aircraft in 2000 when the A380 was launched. As the A380 arrived in service in 2007, the 747 passenger fleet had dropped to about 550 units and has gradually declined further as the Airbus superjumbo fleet expanded. Today, the combined fleet of A380s and 747s in passenger operation is about 430 aircraft.

The 747's decline and the A380's poor sales are no surprise to Boeing, which has consistently been pessimistic about the size of the market for very large aircraft (VLA).

While Boeing competes in the sector with the 747-8, the US manufacturer forecasts that ""just a handful [of passenger VLA deliveries] going forward"", says vice-president marketing Randy Tinseth. Boeing this year eliminated the VLA category from its long-term forecast.

""We see a large airplane market that is so small that we do not believe Airbus will deliver the rest of the A380's backlog,"" Tinseth says.

The scale of the market at which the A380 was aimed back in 2000 is evidenced by data from that year's Airbus Global Market Forecast (GMF). For the VLA category seating 400 passengers or more, the manufacturer estimated demand for 360 deliveries up to 2009 and a further 875 by 2019, putting total demand at 1,235 units (excluding freighters).

In that 2000 forecast, Airbus said: ""The GMF confirms that if the airlines are to continue profitably to meet growing demand for low-cost air travel in the face of intensifying global competition and increasing congestion, they will need substantial numbers of a new generation of aircraft like the A3XX, larger and more economical than anything flying today.""

There need to be some caveats around Airbus's legendary and consistently bullish outlook for long-term ULA demand – it puts 20-year deliveries at 1,400 passenger and freighter aircraft in its latest GMF. Airbus never claimed it would deliver 1,300-plus A380s in 20 years – this was its view of total demand, of which Airbus aimed to secure its usual 50% share – and competition from across the Atlantic was assumed.

Using that 50% proportion puts its 20-year demand forecast in 2000 in the 600-700 unit range – a figure that most of the A380's supplier stakeholders also assumed when evaluating whether to participate in the programme.

In the 10 years since A380 deliveries began, Airbus has delivered 215 aircraft. Although production reached about three a month at its peak, it has never achieved the expected four-a-month rate (with potentially up to eight a month once envisaged) and is now declining to around 0.5 a month.

To put those 215 deliveries in context, assuming the expected four-a-month rate had been achieved (after a three- to four-year ramp-up) Airbus could potentially have delivered 350-400 units over the first decade.

Production delays did not help the A380's early market penetration – deliveries began more than a year late amid build issues that slowed the initial ramp-up. But when it arrived, airlines and their passengers loved the A380.

""Despite a teeth-pulling two years through all the delays et cetera, this aeroplane is a peach,"" Emirates Airline president Tim Clark told FlightGlobal in our 2009 A380 in-service report Judging a giant.

""Once you've flown on it you will not want to go [any other way] if you have a choice – which will make them feel very ill in Seattle.""

All the operators we spoke to back in 2009 put the A380's passenger appeal down to a combination of the quiet and spacious cabins, high standard of in-flight entertainment and its comfortable ride. ""She goes through turbulence like a huge Queen Mary 2 on the North Atlantic in January,"" quipped Clark.

The A380 is popular with Asia-Pacific carriers, but not the the extent that Airbus forecast

Airbus

But its size and game-changing passenger experience has not been enough to enable the A380 to find the mass appeal that Airbus yearned for when it looked enviously at Boeing's success with the 747 back in the 1990s.

""I believe Airbus and Europe in general desperately wanted an aircraft that would have global prestige and also allow Airbus to offer a product that could compete with the – at the time – very profitable Boeing 747,"" says DVB Bank managing director and aviation research chief Bert van Leeuwen. ""The 747 profits were supposed to allow Boeing to cross-subsidise its smaller aircraft. So the market projections at the time may already have been a bit over-optimistic.""

Evans points out that the market the A3XX/A380 was devised for and the one where it finds itself competing have proved very different. ""Competition has increased across the board, as markets have liberalised. When the A380 was launched, almost all Europe-Asia and transpacific routes were flown with 747-400s, generally at a fairly low frequency,"" he says.

""Since then, the number of routes has proliferated, with many markets becoming 'open skies'. So, instead of the A380 being the natural replacement for those 747s, most airlines have downsized to be able to offer higher frequencies and more routes.""

Evans also points to the A380's operating economics as an issue when measured against machinery that was not around during its design stage 20 years ago.

""The A380 was targeted to enter service in 2004, and used technology available in that timeframe. Airbus designed the baseline aircraft to be stretched, but that never happened,"" he says. ""The result is an aircraft with a very large wing and tail surfaces, and a high empty-weight-to-seat figure. Newer widebodies have eroded its cost-per-seat advantage, and the A350-1000 and 777-9X will match it.""

Richard Aboulafia, vice-president of analysis at Teal Group, has long been an outspoken critic of the A380, describing it as ""born to die"". He predicts that the final delivery will take place by 2020, ""with unpleasant losses all around"".

""Launched with a hideous mix of hubris, shoddy market analysis, nationalism and simple wishful thinking, the A380 was destined for a short, painful life,"" he says.

""This has been a learning experience, albeit one for people who should have known better from the start. When launching a new jet, it's important to survey market trends, regulatory changes, likely technological developments, and customer preferences. None of that was done here.""

Van Leeuwen believes that for many operators, the A380's unique selling point – its size – means it is simply too big. ""While filling the aircraft is not that much of a problem, filling the plane with passengers that are paying a decent ticket-price seems to be more of an issue. The huge capacity supply offered by each A380 flight tends to erode away the yield.""

Airbus's 2000 market forecast was also wide of the mark in terms of the regional breakdown in VLA demand. North America was viewed as a key target market when the A380 was launched, while the Middle East was just emerging on the global scene, from a network-carrier perspective – with little prospect of having much appetite for a 500-seater.

Flight Fleets Analyzer shows that at that time there were about 100 747s in passenger service with North American airlines, including 50 with United Airlines and 34 with Northwest Airlines (which merged into Delta Air Lines in 2009). So it was hard to quibble with Airbus's view at the time that North America would account for 17% of 20-year VLA deliveries.

But that market, of course, has proved barren for A380 salesmen as the US 747 passenger fleet has dwindled and none are left in Canada. Just 26 747s remain in passenger service now, and this will decline by a further 11 in November when Delta and United retire their remaining -400s.

Flight Ascend Consultancy head Rob Morris sees the impact of the 9/11 terrorist attacks as having fundamentally changed the dynamics of the US airline market, to the detriment of the A380.

""The A380 was expected to be an aircraft that would work for Northwest/Delta and United as 747 replacements on their transpacific routes where timezones restrict potential frequency and payload-range was key for many routes. But after 9/11, consolidation drove network changes, while the US majors also moved to constrain capacity and manage yield/profit. Today they are extremely successful at this.""

Evans says the US airlines' focus on profit rather than market share has put their emphasis on business traffic and the need for daily frequencies. ""The 747-400 was the right transpacific aircraft but by 2007 it was already being marginalised on the Atlantic,"" he says. ""Asian carriers have gained market share from US airlines across the Pacific, but US airlines have higher yields and appear happy to use midsize widebodies like the 787.""

Aboulafia believes the North American market failed to materialise because airlines had learned through bitter experience how devastating excess capacity could be.

""They also correctly realised that the future belonged to more city-pairs, which called for smaller long-range equipment like the 787 or A350 XWB,"" he says.

Flight Fleets Analyzer projects that by 2019, the Middle East (thanks mainly to Emirates) will represent 50% of the 263 ultra-large passenger aircraft deliveries (A380s and 747-8Is) while Europe will account for 21% and Asia-Pacific 29%. This compares, respectively, with 1%, 20% and 44% in Airbus's 2000 GMF projection for the 2019 VLA passenger fleet (1,235 aircraft).

""I don't think any of us saw the growth of the Middle East mega-connectors,"" says Morris, who believes that region's A380 appetite has probably displaced potential orders from elsewhere. ""Although these have each been A380 customers, they have built their networks with traffic won from network carriers at either end of their flows, as well as stimulating some other traffic, of course.""

Aboulafia says: ""It's an interesting question why the European carriers in Airbus's 'home' countries have taken just 30-something A380s, and don't want any more. They, like the US airlines, have realised what needs to be done to compete in the international air travel market today.""

Evans says the success of the Middle East hub carriers has created a power shift that has affected the likes of Singapore Airlines, Malaysia Airlines and Thai Airways, and probably prevented them placing follow-on A380 orders.

""Qantas is another obvious example, having pulled much capacity out of Europe that was flown by 747s. However, if Emirates had not been seen as the market leader, it is very doubtful that Qatar Airways and Etihad would have ordered the A380.""

Production never quite reached the expected four per month - let alone a theoretical eight - and its now heading down, towards only 0.5

Airbus

Van Leeuwen points to the changing dynamics of aircraft size in the major markets where the 747 had traditionally ruled the roost. ""Like the 767 kicked the 747 out of the transatlantic market by allowing more direct routes to be flown at almost similar seat/mile costs, the 777 has done the same in other markets, for example the transpacific,"" he says. ""Technological progress meant that smaller aircraft could offer both lower trip costs and equal or lower seat-mile costs.""

With A380 sales having effectively flatlined since 2015, Airbus's big headache now is managing the production decline as it awaits the hoped-for resurgence in demand. Having already committed to cutting annual production to 12 A380s, Airbus in July revealed that it would further reduce output to just eight from 2019.

Airbus has 102 aircraft in its A380 backlog, with Emirates, which has deferred some deliveries, accounts for 45. Leasing company Amedeo is the second-largest customer with 20 on backlog – although these deliveries have all been deferred. Another 24 orders are assigned to All Nippon Airways, Qantas, Qatar Airways, Singapore Airlines and Virgin Atlantic, while the remaining 13 are listed against an unidentified customer (10) and an entity called Air Accord (three). The delivery schedules for these 13 – as well as Qantas (eight) and Virgin Atlantic (six) – are unclear.

Airbus chief executive Tom Enders acknowledged earlier this year that the A380 situation was ""not so great"", but the manufacturer expects a relatively small impact from the production cut thanks to ongoing efforts to lower fixed costs associated with the programme. Chief financial officer Harald Wilhelm said Airbus would ""harvest the benefit"" of the cost focus.

Wilhelm also pointed out that Airbus would not continue building at such a low rate if such action significantly affected the margin situation.

After making a lot of noise in 2015-2016 about a possible re-engined and/or stretched ""A380neo"" development, Airbus has now focused on more straightforward enhancements around cabin densification options, increased operating weights, and winglets promising a 4% improvement in fuel burn.

Dubbed the A380plus, the proposed upgrade has received a mixed reaction – and no orders thus far. Emirates – unsurprisingly – is seen as the most likely initial customer but Clark was cool on order prospects at the Paris air show in June, saying he wanted more clarity about the A380 programme's long-term status before making any commitment.

Never one to miss an opportunity to poke its rival, Boeing's Tinseth commented at Paris that the Airbus double-decker was ""frankly too big"" for the passenger market and joked that the winglets would not ""make that airplane any smaller"".

Evans does not see the A380plus having a big impact on the programme's prospects, because it does not go far enough to have a material impact on operating cost and performance. ""It's not a re-engine or re-wing aircraft, so the reduction in unit costs is mostly reliant on persuading airlines to put more seats into the aircraft,"" he says. ""However, several airlines already see the aircraft as too large for their needs.""

Van Leeuwen describes the A380plus as ""too little, too late"" and worries that any prospects for sales to the Middle East carriers could prove more difficult as ""their stars are not shining as bright as a few years ago"".

Aboulafia has already made his position clear on how he sees the A380's future, so does not expect the winglet upgrade to make any difference, given all the factors working against the big jet.

""Airbus is now smart enough to know that an A380neo would be a classic example of throwing good money after bad, yet the company needs to make some kind of last-ditch effort to satisfy Emirates and its industrial partners. The Plus is the result. Completely futile, yet completely necessary,"" he says.

Unless Airbus can convince Emirates – or someone else – to sign for more A380s of any flavour, the manufacturer could face the difficult decision soon about the future of the programme.

""It is Airbus's flagship programme, so it will all depend on the attitudes of key leaders in the company,"" Evans says.

""Airbus has repeatedly said that demand will increase in the long term for an aircraft in this size bracket. If it truly believes this then it needs to keep the A380 in production at low levels for the next decade,"" he adds. ""This is a big challenge given the current market conditions, with Emirates the one key airline that could take six to eight aircraft per annum for as long as it sees a rationale for the aircraft as the mainstay of its fleet.""

When Airbus invented the A380, it was intent on creating an airline-industry game changer, and it has certainly done that. The challenge remains – like the epoch-defining Concorde before it – to convince enough people to play that game.

A few months ago several news outlets reported that an Emirates Dreamliner purchase was a “done deal”, with Emirates set to order a mix of 787-9s and 787-10s at the Dubai Airshow this fall. An Emirates Dreamliner order would be a big coup for Boeing, potentially allowing it to increase its production again.

The airline announced the multi-million-dollar upgrade in August and will introduce its acclaimed business suites to the double-decker planes and boost overall premium seating by 27 percent.

The addition of another six business class and 25 premium economy seats is in response to an increased demand for premium cabins on flights to the US, Europe, and Asia.

It is made possible by removing 30 economy seats and rearranging a crew workstation to use space more effectively.

The premium economy seats will be the version debuting on its Boeing 787s later this year and will be 10 percent wider than the existing seat in a 2-3-2 configuration.

First class will remain on the lower deck but will be refurbished, while economy seats will get new cushioning and improved inflight entertainment.

Work on the 12 A380s is due to begin in the second quarter of 2019 and Airbus said the new interior would take advantage of the superjumbo’s large floor area to most efficiently use the upper deck premium cabins.

It revealed it would develop specifically- tailored monuments for Qantas — the fixtures such as galleys and toilets — as well as “a new and unique business lounge area in the forward upper-deck”.

Work should be finished by “around the end of 2020”, it said.

Airbus Commercial Aircraft EVP programs Didier Evrard said the upgrade showed the continued confidence of Qantas in A380 as a key member of its fleet and a unique way for passengers to travel.

The Qantas A380s will accommodate 485 passengers after the upgrades — and increase of one — with 14 first suites, 70 business suites, 60 premium economy seats and 341 seats in economy.

Although Airbus is struggling to sell A380s, the superjumbo remains popular with passengers and the way airlines initially configured their cabins means it has developed a reputation as a comfortable plane in which to travel.

More than 170 million passengers have flown on the double-decker aircraft and some 240 airports now accommodate it.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9885256886482239}",positive,0.9885256886482239,1

European aircraft manufacturer Airbus Group SE on Wednesday delivered its first European and Chinese made wide-body A330 aircraft to Tianjin Airlines from its completion and delivery center in Tianjin.

This aircraft was completed by some 150 Chinese staff members earlier in Toulouse, France, where they were trained by Airbus experts for six to nine months, and they will later work at the Tianjin center.

Meanwhile, Airbus inaugurated the Tianjin center on Wednesday, its first wide-body completion and delivery center outside Europe. The center will employ more than 250 people in total and will be ready to deliver two aircraft per month by early 2019.

The center covers various aircraft completion activities, including cabin installation, aircraft painting and production flight test, as well as customer flight acceptance and aircraft delivery.

With an investment of $250 million, the Airbus (Tianjin) Final Assembly Co Ltd has 51 percent of its share held by Airbus, and 49 percent of shares held by Tianjin Free Trade Zone Investment Co Ltd and the Aviation Industry Corporation of China.

""The inauguration of our A330 completion and delivery center in Tianjin, marks a new milestone for Airbus' international footprint and underlines the strong spirit of cooperation with our Chinese partners,"" said Fabrice Bregier, Airbus COO and president of Airbus Commercial Aircraft.

""Wide-body aircraft completed in China is an Airbus and an industry first. It demonstrates our mutual commitments to a strong and growing Chinese aviation sector.""

By the end of August, there were 202 A330 aircraft in service in the Chinese mainland, taking 55 percent of the wide-body market share.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9444693922996521}",neutral,0.9444693922996521,0
Airbus uses first 3D printed part in A350 engine pylon. - Airline Ratings,"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyYXRpbmdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy11c2VzLWZpcnN0LTNkLXByaW50ZWQtcGFydC1hMzUwLWVuZ2luZS1weWxvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has for the first time installed in a production aircraft a titanium bracket produced by a 3D printing process.

The bracket is part of the engine pylon, the junction between the wings and the engines, on an A350 XWB.

The European manufacturer said the move was a first step towards qualification of more complex 3D-printed parts on production aircraft.

Additive-layer manufacturing, as 3D Printing is also known, uses a fine base powder such as aluminium, titanium, stainless steel of plastics to build a component by repeatedly adding thin layers.

It allows the construction of complex, computer-designed components that would be difficult to build using traditional manufacturing.

Airbus has been looking at the technology for a number of years and already uses 3D printed parts on some A320neo and A350 aircraft, including metal cabin brackets and bleed pipes.

The parts can be up to 70 per cent cheaper as well as much quicker to produce and Airbus officials are looking to harness a technology they have described as a potential game changer for design and manufacturing.

The technology has the potential to reduce the material wasted when milling parts as well as cut down the shipping of materials to multiple sites producing components.

It also offers a simpler way to produce complex assemblies and allows prototype parts to be made to ensure they work correctly or fit together properly with other components.

The manufacturer has predicted the number of printed parts could number in the thousands in coming years.

But first regulators need to be certify the parts and be convinced they are as robust as those made by traditional means when used in areas subject to structural stress.

Airbus rival Boeing announced earlier this year it would using 3D-printed titanium parts in the construction of its 787 Dreamliner jet airliner.

These are the were the first 3D-printed structural components to be approved by the Federal Aviation Administration and manufacturer Norsk Titanium predicted the shift to the technology could eventually save the US plane maker up to $3 million in construction costs per jet.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9994434714317322}",neutral,0.9994434714317322,0

Almost ten years after the start of the project, a European flying lab will take-off later this month to explore and research the Holy Grail of aerodynamics – natural laminar flow (NLF).

The Clean Sky 2 BLADE (Breakthrough Laminar Aircraft Demonstrator in Europe) demonstrator, was rolled out of its hangar in Tarbes in the south of France at the start of September. BLADE is a highly-modified Airbus A340 airliner and the culmination of nearly ten years of research, planning and ground tests by Airbus and its industrial and academic partners on this pan-European aerospace project. With its outer wings removed and replaced by two new panels packed with sensors, BLADE is set to study laminar flow in flight to a level of detail never seen before.

If successful, its flight tests could lead to the way to a step-change in NLF aerodynamics for civil airliners with up to 8% drag reduction for a short-range airliner. This would translate into 5% block fuel burn saving on a typical 800nm single-aisle mission. Given that millions are invested each year to improve engine fuel efficiency by an average of 1%, exploiting NLF represents a tantalising goal for the industry in helping to meeting the challeng environmental targets set by Europe’s ACARE 2020.

Go with the flow

Advances by civil aircraft manufacturers since the dawn of the jet age are sometimes taken for granted. Notes Axel Flaig, Head of R&T, Airbus, which is the leader on this project: “Aviation has achieved lot in past 50 years with more than a 70% reduction in fuel flow, and noise down by 90%.” These advances have, however, been mostly driven by engine manufacturers, developing, cleaner, quieter, fuel-sipping turbofans. With aero engine development (at least for conventional kerosene-powered turbofans) now plateauing in terms of efficiency: “The next big step is to look at friction"" says Flaig. The ball is now in the airframers’ court. Flaig says that BLADE’s goal is to reduce wing friction drag by a whopping 50%.

Harnessing natural laminar flow, of course, is not a new idea and has been around for decades, with perhaps one of the first attempts being the North American P-51 Mustang. Simply put, a laminar flow wing, with a different side-on profile and extremely smooth surface, aims to delay the separation of the air as it races across the top of the wing - greatly reducing drag. The longer the flow over the wing can be smoothly laminar, 'sticking' to the wings surface, as opposed to turbulent, the better.

"" It is the most advanced flight test installation we have ever done at Airbus""

Though the basics are well understood, converting NLF from laboratory or wind-tunnel tests into a practical wing able to be built and survive the rigours of everyday airline operations has proved frustratingly elusive. NLF over a wing in the air exists in a very fickle state and can separate into turbulent flow by a whole range of microscopic flaws or tiny movements, including wing contamination (ice, grease, insects, dents) deformation (wing flexing, joints), loose fastener heads and even acoustic disturbances and vibrations.

These demanding requirements for an ultra-smooth surface and stiffer wing also mean that new design and manufacturing techniques are needed to first, create a wing that is super slippery, and second, build one that can be mass-produced, can be easily maintained and retains its NLF qualities in regular airline operations.

These challenging requirements for an ‘industrial wing’ to be used in everyday service (as opposed to a highly prepared wing in wind-tunnel testing in controlled conditions) explains why it is only now, with today’s sophisticated CFD flow simulation and advances in precision manufacturing, an optimised industrial-quality natural laminar flow wing is now almost within aerospace’s grasp. With BLADE, Airbus is aiming for laminar flow from the leading edge to 50% chord.

Enter BLADE

BLADE is a Clean Sky project, with the A340 part of Airbus's new in-house FlightLab technology demonstrator arm. (Airbus)

To test this, Airbus and its partners will use a heavily modified four-engine A340 airliner (in reality MSN001, the first A340 prototype). This has had its outer wings replaced by two reduced sweep (20 deg) laminar flow outer wings, that are designed to be two-thirds the size of a single-aisle airliner wings. Each of the outer NLF wing upper skins and leading edges (both wing sections integrated by Aernnova) are supplied by two different manufacturers (GKN Aerospace and Saab) with each featuring a different construction and assembly. GKN’s wing, on the starboard, features a more conventional architecture with a metal leading edge and composite cover. Saab’s wing on the port wing, on the other hand, features a one-piece composite surface, with integrated rib feets and spar cap.

In addition, the wing sections are separated and bookended by aerodynamic pods that both keep the NLF airflow separate from the inner wing section and are also packed with advanced sensors (see below).

The A340 BLADE also features a pod on the vertical tail that houses thermal sensors looking down onto the wings. This pod is a more elegant and easier location than an earlier concept which would have seen a sensor pod mounted on struts above the centre fuselage.

But if the wings being tested are for a single-aisle airliner, why use an A340? Using a large four-engine design like this offers some advantages says Airbus. For one, the A340 has a natural junction outboard of the outer engines where a new wing can be installed. Secondly, replacing part of a larger aircraft's wing in an inflight flying lab, will give more predictive and better safety margins than if, for example, a smaller entire wing was swapped. Should the results prove unexpected in some way, they aircraft will still have most of its wing producing lift. It is worth noting that a laminar flow wing changes the handling qualities and performance (stall speeds etc) and thus adding a wing to a larger airliner provides an additional safety margin. Finally, replacing the outer wings on an existing larger airliner, is a cheaper solution than building entirely new wings for a smaller airliner. An A320 NLF demonstrator, for example, would also need new nacelles and pylons integrated – a far more complex and expensive project.

A flood of data

No wool tufts measuring airflow here - the end pod will use HD cameras to detect laminar flow.

While Airbus test aircraft are no stranger to advanced sensors - the measurements being taken by the A340 BLADE test aircraft will break new ground in accuracy with 87,000 parameters measured by some 2,700 sensors. Indeed, some measure of how precise measurements of NLF and laminar/turbulent separation need to be can be gained in that lasers were rejected as not being accurate enough. “It is the most advanced flight test installation we have ever done at Airbus” says Daniel Keirbel, the BLADE Project Leader since 2015.

To study NLF and measure laminar/turbulent transition on the new wing test sections, thermal cameras in a pod installed on the vertical tail will measure tiny differences in temperature that show where the cooler laminar-flow air breaks down into a hotter turbulent flow.

But this is only half the story. To cross check this laminar flow, HD cameras in the wing pods will use reflectology to watch a zebra-like test pattern reflected in the mirror-like wings surfaces looking to see if separation is being caused by tiny flexes or deformation in the wing's surface. Eight cameras will be able to see disturbances on the skin as small as 20 microns, or almost a quarter of the width of a human hair. Meanwhile, spread out underneath the wings skin are waviness sensors which, (like the inside of Yale locks) can measure whether the wing itself is distorting in tiny imperceptible ways.

Other sensors include 1,200 pressure sensors, accelerometers and the aircraft itself is expected to generate a staggering 4Tb of data each flight, the majority (75%) of this from the reflectology HD cameras that will scan for tiny changes in the aircraft’s skin.

Microphones are also fitted to measure acoustic disturbances and the A340 BLADE is also fitted with an extremely unusual piece of equipment for a test aircraft – a loudspeaker. Such is the sensitivity of NLR that turbulent separation can be triggered by acoustics. Therefore Airbus will test to see what the effect of noisy engines are on laminar flow with a series of pure tones. (Although one Flight Test Engineer did jokingly express to aviation reporters a preference to blast out AC/DC at the wings).

The road to Cleaner Skies

BLADE A340 inside low-speed wind-tunnel (Clean Sky)

It has been a long and winding road to get here. The BLADE technology project, as part of the EU’s Clean Sky's Smart Fixed-Wing Aircraft Integrated Technology Demonstrator (SFW-ITD) has involved a large number of industrial and academic partners from around Europe, from Spain to Sweden, and from Romania to the UK. All told, BLADE features 21 partners from across Europe including Airbus, Dassault, Saab, Safran, Aernnova, GKN Aerospace, Romaero, EURECAT, as well as SMEs such as Sertc, Asco, Aritx, FTI-Engineering and research bodies like DLR, NLR and ONERA.

Launched in 2008, BLADE saw a concept freeze review in 2010, maturity reviews of the wings between 2010 and 2014. Manufacturing of the upper covers began in 2015, while the existing wings were removed and new ones joined in 2016. This year saw aircraft power on in February and flight test instrumentation integration completed in August.

The extensive preparation has also included CFD testing, low-speed wind-tunnel testing as well developing the flight test anti-contamination device.

Flight test

Flight Test Engineers station. BLADE will generate up to 4TB of data each flight.

With BLADE now handed over to the flight test team, the aircraft is set to fly for the first time in the second week of September. The flight test campaign will consist of two phases, in 2017 and in 2018, with the goal of flying around 120-150 hours. The first phase in Q4 of 2017 will see aircraft handling qualities assessed, the flight envelope opened out to obtain initial results from the NLF wing sections.

Stalls will be tested as the modification to a new aerofoil section will change the aircraft's handling necessitating a careful approach. To incorporate the NLR sections, the existing wings have also had their slats disabled, making for a higher landing speed. As one Airbus source noted, it will be a 'bizarre aircraft to fly' with wings that are two-thirds 1980's technology and one-third, the latest cutting-edge. optimised laminar flow design.

Interestingly, the reflectology measuring sensors means that there are limitations due to the angle of the Sun, with a four-hour sweet spot either side of the zenith where the miniscule deformations in the skin can be observed by the cameras. For this reason, from around late October onward, the aircraft will have to curtail flight testing (or move south) during winter as the Sun will not be at the correct angle.

Project engineers will start slowly, with the goal of flying at the sweet spot for NLF – Mach 0.75. Then the speed will be increased to 0.79 and above, with the goal of measuring in detail never-before recorded when separation happens on a full-size wing in flight.

Sharp-eyed observers will notice that the wing sweep of the outer test NLF wings are around 20degs, compared with 30degs for the rest of the swept wing. The reason highlights a tricky compromise for future airliner designers – optimise a wing with (shallower sweep) that maintains laminar flow at around Mach 0.75 and save fuel, or fly faster at the usual cruising speed of Mach 0.82-0.85 and see boundary layer separation as the aircraft goes faster. One solution might be hybrid laminar-flow, either passive or active, to 'suck' the airflow to the wing and keep the drag down at higher speeds. A slower, but more fuel efficient, straighter wing thus means that the first applications could be in narrowbody airliners on short-haul routes, where slower cruise speeds may not make too much of a difference compared to long-haul.

A second phase of flight testing, in 2018, will test the robustness of laminarity in representative operational conditions. This will include artificially introducing contaminants such as grease, or finding concentrations of insects to dirty the wing, with the goal of seeing when NLF breaks down A 2m fixed Krueger flap section will also be tested to act as a possible anti-contamination device that could be a solution for protecting the wing from insects on take-off and landing in regular operations. A peel-off paper strip, activated by pilots using a cable after take-off will protect the leading edge from dead bugs during flight tests.

BLADE also includes aspects of maintainability – with Airbus drawing on its in-house maintenance experts to judge whether a contaminated wing can be recognised by eyesight alone and to help define what airline maintenance requirements might be.

Ease of maintainability, will thus be a crucial factor in selling an airliner with NLF to airline customers in the future. Oddly, one unexpected spin-off of Lockheed Martin F-35 in the future will be a global pool of military maintenance technicians with experience of looking after an aircraft with unique coatings and a need to keep the surface extremely smooth. Some of these will naturally migrate to the civil sector and therefore there may be a body of experience well versed already in some of the requirements for supporting NLF-winged airliners – when it finally enters the market.

Clipped wings?

The NLF wing is optimised to be extremely smooth for laminar flow, but has also been designed to be industrially feasible.

Readers from the UK may note the irony that just as wing design, testing and development is set to enter a new era of aerodynamics, Britain is set to exit the EU in two years time, potentially hampering a field in which otherwise it would be considered a natural leader in commercialising and productionising this technology. Airbus in the UK, with its Wing of the Future project, is still set to play a central role and, indeed, should BLADE prove successful, then it is highly likely this technology could find its way onto Airbus' next generation single-aisle product. However, as an EU project, it is unclear what access UK companies and academic institutions may have in the follow-on Clean Sky 3. Some companies have already begun highlighting their European facilities and factories and stressing that they should be considered European, rather than UK entities.

Summary

BLADE is Europe's most advanced aerodynamics demonstrator. (Airbus)

The A340 BLADE flight tests, on Europe’s largest ever flight test demonstrator are thus set to be a landmark in aerodynamics research – as the first industrial transonic laminar flow flight test. The sheer amount and granularity of data expected from this testbed should prove invaluable in helping engineers design ultra-efficient wings and airframes for the next generation of airliners. This sort of research, with a large flying demonstrator or 'X-plane', will also help keep Airbus and the European aerospace sector ahead of rivals, just as the duopoly faces new entrants keen to muscle in on Toulouse and Seattle's turf.

Another spin-off benefit is that having developed this flying, instrumented testbed, it could form the basis to explore laminar flow even further, for example, with active or passive hybrid flow solutions, or perhaps even self-cleaning nanotechnology coatings in follow-on trials.

For this BLADE runner – it is wake-up, time to fly.

Germany and Norway place firm order for fleet of five NATO-owned Airbus A330 MRTT tankers - Airbus,"Mon, 25 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNy0wOS1nZXJtYW55LWFuZC1ub3J3YXktcGxhY2UtZmlybS1vcmRlci1mb3ItZmxlZXQtb2YtZml2ZS1uYXRvLW93bmVk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Order to be placed by NSPA through OCCAR under EDA initiative

Madrid, 25 September 2017 – Airbus Defence and Space has received a firm order for five Airbus A330 MRTT Multi Role Tanker Transports from Europe’s organisation for the management of cooperative armament programmes – OCCAR – on behalf of NATO Support & Procurement Agency (NSPA) and funded by Germany and Norway.

The order follows the announcement on 29 June of a Memorandum of Understanding under which the two nations would join Netherlands and Luxembourg in the European/NATO Multinational Multi-Role Tanker Transport Fleet (MMF) programme.

A contract amendment signed at the OCCAR headquarters in Bonn, Germany today adds five aircraft to the two previously ordered by Netherlands and Luxembourg and includes four additional options to enable other nations to join the grouping. It includes two years of initial support.

The programme is funded by the four nations who will have the exclusive right to operate these NATO–owned aircraft in a pooling arrangement. The aircraft will be configured for in-flight refuelling, the transport of passengers and cargo, and medical evacuation flights.

The first two aircraft have already been ordered to be delivered from Airbus Defence and Space’s tanker conversion line at Getafe near Madrid and all seven are expected to be handed over between 2020 and 2022.

The European Defence Agency (EDA) initiated the MMF programme in 2012. OCCAR manages the MMF acquisition phase as Contract Executing Agent on behalf of NSPA. Following the acquisition phase, NSPA will be responsible for the complete life-cycle management of the fleet.

Airbus Defence and Space Head of Military Aircraft Fernando Alonso said: “This new order further demonstrates the A330 MRTT’s position as the world’s premier tanker/transport aircraft. But it also firmly establishes the MMF as one of Europe’s most important collaborative programmes and a model for the future European defence projects which are expected to be launched in the coming years.”

On Monday evening, the first Airbus A350-900 aircraft set to be delivered to Malaysia Airlines rolled out of the paint shop in Toulouse, France. The airline has a total of six A350 aircraft on order, all of which are leased from Air Lease Corporation, or ALC, according to the airline.

Per Business Traveller, the aircraft will have around 300 total seats, separated into economy, business, and first class. Though there will be no premium economy class, eligible Enrich members will have access to economy seats with extra legroom.

Malaysia Airlines is expected to take delivery of the aircraft by December 31, 2017, according to Business Traveller, which is a slight delay of their originally scheduled delivery time.

The airline is looking to start A350 service to London in January 2018 while holding off on expansion in other major European cities.

The aircraft was being moved from the paint shop on Tuesday evening lacking engines. It features the carrier’s latest livery, which can be seen on the A380 and some 737 aircraft.

H145M completes first flight with HForce weapon system - Vertical Magazine,"Fri, 08 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2gxNDVtLWNvbXBsZXRlcy1maXJzdC1mbGlnaHQtaGZvcmNlLXdlYXBvbi1zeXN0ZW0v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"At the end of August, the H145M performed its first flight with a complete HForce weapon system in Donauwörth, Germany. Thanks to this modular weapon system designed by Airbus, the H145M can be equipped with all kind of guided and ballistic armaments such as missiles and laser guided rockets, guns, machine guns and rockets. The qualification of HForce for use on the H145M is planned for 2018.

“The next steps prior to qualification include a firing campaign, testing the whole fire mission spectrum through guns, cannons and rockets in Hungary as well as tests on the laser-guided rockets in Sweden before the end of the year,” said Jean-Luc André, HForce Program Manager at Airbus Helicopters. “As the launch customer for the H145M with the HForce weapon system, the Republic of Serbia has ordered nine H145M aircraft, including four attack helicopters equipped with HForce”, he added.

HForce is a comprehensive, modular and cost-efficient weapon system that can be used on any military version of Airbus’ civil helicopter range (H125M, H145M and H225M). The flexible weapon management system enables armies around the world to complement their fleets with specialised versions of light attack helicopters.

The H145M is the military version of the tried-and-tested, twin-engine H145 civil helicopter that was first delivered in 2014. The entire H145 fleet has now clocked up more than 60,000 flight hours. With a maximum takeoff weight of 3.7 tonnes, the agile light attack H145M, which perfectly matches the needs of special forces, can be used for a wide range of tasks, including armed reconnaissance, ground fire support, escort, tactical transport, medevac and casevac. Customers for the H145M include the German Armed Forces – which in June received their 15th H145M LUH SOF helicopter on time and on budget – as well as the Republic of Serbia and the Kingdom of Thailand.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999995231628418}",neutral,0.999995231628418,0
"Recaro CL6710 launch partner change down to engines, not seats - Runway Girl Network","Thu, 14 Sep 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTcvMDkvcmVjYXJvLWNsNjcxMC1sYXVuY2gtcGFydG5lci1jaGFuZ2UtZG93bi10by1lbmdpbmVzLW5vdC1zZWF0cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If you need a sign of the interdependence of various parts of the aviation industry supply chain, delays in Rolls-Royce engine delivery for the Airbus A330-900neo has meant that Recaro’s launch customer for the CL6710 staggered, fully flat business class seat with direct aisle access is not TAP Portugal on the A330neo as long planned, but instead the seat is now flying on El Al’s Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner.

TAP had hoped to launch the product since it — and the Airspace cabin — was unveiled at the Aircraft Interiors Expo in 2016. Recaro and Airbus confirmed to Runway Girl Network that the delay is due not to seat production or certification issues, but to the delay of the A330neo airframe.

“Rolls-Royce was a little late in their delivery of the engines, this being the cumulative effect of working hard on the production of the A350-900, the A350-1000,” an Airbus spokesperson told RGN, putting a positive spin on the reasons for the delay, announced by Airbus Fabrice Brégier as “a little bit late” this January.

That delay, a Recaro spokesperson said, “is a question of project timelines: TAP has ordered the Recaro business class seat CL6710 for the new A330-900neo. The delivery of this aircraft to launch customer TAP was planned for 2017, then postponed.”

“There are no delays to the Recaro business class seat CL6710,” the Recaro spokesperson emphasised. “Quite the contrary: Recaro reacts flexibly on the new lead time for the A330-900neo.” The aircraft is expected to begin test flights later this month, with deliveries previously expected in the northern hemisphere spring of 2018, an overall slippage of approximately six months.

“TAP is still the launch customer for the CL6710 on Airbus aircraft,” Recaro confirmed to RGN. An Airbus spokesperson told RGN that “TAP is still the first customer to receive [the] first A330neo. First delivery is planned for H1 2018 – but precise delivery date is to be announced by our customer so I can’t go further into details here.”

For Recaro’s part, though, “El Al ordered the CL6710 for its new B787 Dreamliner that had its inaugural flight today,” the spokesperson said, adding that, as a result, “El Al became launch customer for the new Recaro business class seat.”

The CL6710’s Airbus certification process, Recaro confirmed, is on time and expected to continue to programme for the A330neo. “The CL6710 is currently in the last phase of certification. Upon completion all test reports will be submitted to EASA for formal certification,” the company’s spokesperson said.

“The premiere of our CL6710 business class seat is an important milestone for our company and makes us proud,” Recaro chief executive officer, Mark Hiller, said marking the launch on 12 September.

Indeed, El Al’s Dreamliner is a fully Recaro-equipped jet, with the airline “also deploying Recaro’s CL3710 and PL3530 seats in the economy and premium economy classes,” the seatmaker said.

The company also noted in a statement that “El Al has equipped 16 model B787-9 and B787-8 aircraft with Recaro seats, and others are planned.” El Al’s existing widebody fleet offers a fairly wide range of relatively uncompetitive business class products, so a decent modern fully flat product with direct aisle access will be a benefit, particularly since the airline operates a number of longhaul and ultra-longhaul routes.

Of course, the same can be said for TAP in terms of current and future product — when it eventually gets its A330neos and CL6710s.
