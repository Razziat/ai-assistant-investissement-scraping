All in the Family

The Airbus Final Assembly Line in Mobile was designed to build a family of related aircraft. The A319, A320 and A321 have the same wingspan and fuselage width, but different fuselage lengths. This gives customers a range of options for the capacity of the planes, in addition to choices about engines, seating and entertainment systems. After starting out building A321s, the plant began work in late spring on its first A320. It is due to be delivered to Spirit Airlines this summer. (Courtesy Airbus/AIDT)

International Assembly

In Airbus' manufacturing process for A320-family jets, major components such as the fuselage and wings are made at various locations in Europe, then shipped to the Final Assembly Lines (FALs) where the jets are built and tested. A320-family aircraft are assembled in four locations: Toulouse, France; Hamburg, Germany; Tianjin, China; and Mobile. The process of shipping the components has been featured in an episode of the Science Channel program ""Mega Shippers."" (Courtesy of Airbus/AIDT)

Once components are offloaded from ships at the Port of Mobile, they are trucked a short distance to the Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley, escorted by festive Mardi Gras floats along a parade route lined by cheering citizens. (Well, okay, that just happened when the components arrived for the first Mobile-built A321, back in June 2015. But folks probably are still scratching their heads in Toulouse, Hamburg and Tianjin.)

The “flow line” concept calls for an aircraft to move through several fixed workstations. A jet doesn’t gets its wheels (and wings) until it arrives at Station 40 – so getting it there requires the use of a hoist. Some describe this as a “first flight.” (Courtesy of Airbus/AIDT)

Station 35

At Station 35, big things happen inside and outside the plane. The vertical and horizontal stabilizers are attached as well as the tail cone and Auxiliary Power Unit. Other additions include inner flaps, main landing gear doors, nose, radome, antennas, overhead stowage and other cabin fixtures, and testing begins on electronics, climate and control systems. The hydraulic system is powered up for the first time. Shown: Horizontal stabilizers are prepared for installation. (Courtesy of Airbus).

The Dock

In The Dock, workers install engines and engine cowlings, seats and carpeting, and continue to test various systems. Meanwhile, other jets are coming along the line.

Painting

A lot happens after a jet leaves The Dock. It goes to a gauging shed where its fuel tanks and gauges are checked, to “Final Phase” assembly for detail work on its cabins. And it’s painted, a process that involves skilled workers and less automation than you might expect. (Courtesy MAAS Aviation)

Delivery

When it’s time to hand a finished jet over to its new owner, the aircraft is moved to the delivery building. It’s not always accompanied by the whole FAL workforce in matching jerseys, accompanied by music from the University of South Alabama band, but it’s still a big deal.

On Sunday, Delta Air Lines took delivery of its very first next generation Airbus A350-900 airliner.

Delta's first A350 arrived at its base in Atlanta just after 2:00 am on Sunday following a delivery flight from Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France.

Upon arrival, the plane was greeted by a ceremonial water cannon salute before pulling up to a gate.

The new wide-body jet is one of the 25 A350s Delta ordered in 2014 and is the first of five Airbus will deliver to the airline this year.

In May, Delta announced that it is deferring delivery of 10 A350s by at least two to three years.

The Airbus A350 entered service in early 2015 with Qatar Airways and is now in operation with roughly a dozen airlines around the world. However, Delta will be the aircraft's first operator in North America.

With room for 306 passengers, Delta's A350s are expected to take over many of its trans-Pacific flights currently operated by its aging fleet of 747-400 jumbo jets. Delta's fleet of 747s, which were inherited from Northwest Airlines following their 2008 merger, has been in service an average of 26 years and is set to be retired at the end of the year.

The A350-900 is powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce Trent XWB turbofan engines each producing 84,000 lbs. of thrust. The aircraft is optimized for efficient long-haul flying and boasts a range of 8,000 miles.

Inside, the jet will have room for 32 private Delta One suites, 48 new Delta premium economy seats, and 226 main cabin seats. All cabins will have wi-fi connectivity, USB charging, and personal in-flight entertainment. In addition, the A350's carbon fiber reinforced plastic fuselage allows the cabin to be pressurized to mimic conditions at 6,000 feet of altitude, allowing for a more comfortable ride.

Over the next couple of months, Delta will prepare the A350 for its inaugural commercial flight from Detroit to Tokyo-Narita International Airport on October 30.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999971389770508}",neutral,0.9999971389770508,0
"Airbus A380, world's largest passenger jet, making 1st regular O'Hare flights next year - Chicago Tribune","Tue, 08 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaWNhZ290cmlidW5lLmNvbS8yMDE3LzA4LzA4L2FpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLXdvcmxkcy1sYXJnZXN0LXBhc3Nlbmdlci1qZXQtbWFraW5nLTFzdC1yZWd1bGFyLW9oYXJlLWZsaWdodHMtbmV4dC15ZWFyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The world’s largest passenger airplane will begin making regular stops at O’Hare International Airport next year.

British Airways will begin using the double-decker Airbus A380 on one of two daily flights between Chicago and London starting May 8, the airline said Tuesday in a news release.

It’s the first regularly scheduled flight on the monster jet in Chicago.

British Airways and partner American Airlines already operate six daily flights between Chicago and London. Switching one of those flights to the larger jet will let the airlines carry nearly 20 percent more passengers across the Atlantic, British Airways said.

“The addition of the Airbus A380 for direct service from O’Hare to London is great news for travelers in Chicago and around the world,” Chicago Department of Aviation Commissioner Ginger Evans said in the news release. “Chicago is always looking for ways to offer our passengers new and improved options for international travel. Thanks to our partners at British Airways, we will bring more visitors directly to our city on one of the largest and most exciting aircraft in the world.”

The aircraft seats up to 469 passengers in four cabins, including 14 first-class suites, 97 lie-flat business-class seats and 55 premium economy seats, with the remaining 303 in coach, British Airways said.

London-bound passengers who want to fly the A380 will need to take the British Airways flight departing Chicago at 5:30 p.m. The A380 will fly the 10:50 a.m. flight from London to Chicago.

It isn’t the aircraft’s first stop in Chicago. Dubai-based airline Emirates flew the aircraft to O’Hare in July 2016 to test out airport improvements designed to accommodate the jet, which is 238 feet long and 79 feet high, with a 261-foot wingspan. A Lufthansa-operated A380 also touched down in 2007 while touring the U.S. and completing Federal Aviation Administration-required technical procedures before starting U.S. passenger service.

Chicago has had a runway big enough to handle the A380 since 2013 but lacked a gate that fit the two-level plane at that time. Although a Boeing 747 is longer, the A380 is wider and has two decks spanning the full length of the plane.

A second runway capable of serving the A380 is currently under construction at O’Hare and is expected to be completed in 2020. Another A380-ready gate is also among the nine new gates planned as part of the expansion of Terminal 5.

The A380 hasn’t been an easy sell for aircraft manufacturer Airbus, which announced plans to scale back production last month after making a similar reduction last year. Chicago-based Boeing also has cut production plans for its mega jet, the 747.

But the improvements at O’Hare aren’t about catering to any particular aircraft, the Aviation Department said. The new runways and gate will help O’Hare handle more international traffic and wide-body aircraft, the department said in the news release.

Flying-car company Lilium has hired ex-Gett and Airbus execs to help make its on-demand air taxis a reality by 2025 - Vox.com,"Mon, 21 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZveC5jb20vMjAxNy84LzIxLzE2MTc2MDM4L2ZseWluZy1jYXItbGlsaXVtLXZ0b2wtdGVzbGEtYWlyYnVzLWdldHQtdWJlctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It turns out that Jetsons-like “flying cars” may eventually become a reality.

Lilium, a company developing these vertical take-off and landing jets, has already built a full-scale prototype, which it flew for the first time in April. Now, the Europe-based company is working on building out the business for these futuristic jets.

To do that, Lilium has brought in two executives to help scale the company as it prepares to explore commercial applications for its VTOL aircrafts. The first is Remo Gerber, who has been hired to be Lilium’s chief commercial officer. Gerber, who has a background in physics, previously headed up ride-hail company Gett’s Western European arm.

Gerber’s experience managing a ride-hail business lends itself to Lilium’s long-term plan of working with partners to create an on-demand network of VTOL jets. (Yes, Uber for flying cars.)

Ideally, cities would put up landing pads where a passenger can hail and then ride in a VTOL jet. Think of it like a helipad for helicopters. The difference is that VTOL jets use propulsion to take off and land, so the idea is that it should be much quieter than a helicopter.

You can see more on how the jet actually takes off here:

Since the company is only two years old and has yet to staff up its executive ranks, Gerber will also be handling responsibilities usually held by a CFO or COO, such as investor relations and finances.

Gerber said the company is laser-focused on bringing its vehicles to market; he will also continue discussions the company has already begun with potential commercial partners and regulators.

“The industry is really waking up,” Gerber told Recode. “People are starting to get excited about this.”

“[What is] quite unique about Lilium [is] we have a full-size prototype flying,” he said. “We are looking at a situation where we have a team of incredibly talented engineers that have proven that it is possible to create an aircraft that can take off and land vertically. Ultimately, we are very clearly looking into the future, we are thinking about how we are going to market.”

While Lilium will be turning to partners to commercialize its flying cars, the company will manufacture them in-house. Lilium has brought on Dirk Gebser, the former VP of assembly for two Airbus models and former director of manufacturing engineering at Rolls-Royce. Gebser is joining as vice president of production as the company prepares to meet its 2019 deadline of launching its first manned flight.

Lilium is certainly not the only company with ambitions for a flying car service. The company, which has raised $11.4 million from VC firms Atomico and e42 Ventures, is also competing against a Larry Page-backed company called Kitty Hawk and others.

Uber has talked about its own flying-car ambitions, which entail developing the on-demand platform that these jets will operate on. The ride-hail company is shooting to demonstrate its network of flying cars in Dubai and Texas by 2020.

The flying-car space is moving quickly past the prototype phase in an attempt to bring these new forms of transportation to market.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999065399169922}",neutral,0.9999065399169922,0
Airbus Helicopters and IAR deepen strategic partnership on H215M with 15-year agreement - Airbus,"Thu, 24 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNy0wOC1haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtYW5kLWlhci1kZWVwZW4tc3RyYXRlZ2ljLXBhcnRuZXJzaGlwLW9uLWgyMTVt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Agreement signed in the presence of French President Emmanuel Macron and Romanian President Klaus Iohannis

Bucharest, Romania, 24 August 2017 – Airbus Helicopters and IAR, Romania’s leading aerospace company, have decided to extend their exclusive cooperation on the H215M multirole helicopter. Under this general agreement IAR will become the prime contractor for the H215M for any future order by the Romanian Ministry of Defense to replace their ageing fleet. Initially signed for 5 years, the agreement has been extended to 15 years, further underlining the commitment of Airbus Helicopters and IAR to jointly contribute to the modernization of the Romanian armed forces fleet of multirole helicopters in the long term.

The announcement took place during French President Emmanuel Macron’s official visit to Bucharest and in presence of Romanian President Klaus Iohannis.

“We are proud to have extended this agreement as a result of a long term trust between IAR and Airbus Helicopters” said Neculai Banea, General Director of IAR. “IAR has built over 360 helicopters under Airbus Helicopters’ license over the past decades, which makes us confident in the future success of the H215M” he added.

Under this agreement, IAR will act as prime contractor for all future H215M orders that could be placed by the Romanian Ministry of Defense. It also covers cooperation between Airbus Helicopters and IAR on the production, assembly, customization, support and maintenance of the H215M helicopters destined to the Romanian Armed Forces, and export if opportunities arise.

“This 15-year agreement puts IAR and Airbus Helicopters in the best position to meet the future needs of the Romanian Armed Forces as they look at renewing their fleets of medium and heavy multirole helicopters” said Olivier Michalon, Airbus Helicopters Senior Vice President, Head of Europe region. “Our goal of delivering superior value for our Romanian customers by offering the most complete line of products and services underlines Airbus’ unfaltering commitment to Romania. Each major Airbus business unit contributes directly to the strengthening of the European defence industrial base. Today Airbus already accounts for over 5,000 direct and indirect jobs in Romania, through its divisions, Helicopters and Defence and Space, Commercial Airplanes with Premium Aerotec, as well as industrial partners like Aerostar, Turbomecanica, Aeroteh, Aerofina, etc., making the company the largest aerospace investor in the country,” he added.

Airbus Helicopters has been present in Romania for over fifteen years through its customer centre, Airbus Helicopters Romania, a successful enterprise since its creation with about 75 per cent of its turnover achieved through export contracts. Airbus Helicopters Industries, a 10,000m² factory based in Brasov, was inaugurated in 2016 and will house production of the H215 in Romania.

Where giants are born - CNET,"Wed, 16 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtY29udm95L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An hour's drive outside the French city of Toulouse, just beyond farmhouses set in verdant fields and rose-colored villages basking in an early spring sunset, sits an unexpected sight: six sections of the world's largest commercial airplane.

I've arrived not at an airplane graveyard, but at the starting point for the final leg of the Itinéraire à Grand Gabarit, the route that Airbus uses to transport parts of its ginormous A380 airliner to Toulouse for final assembly. The newly built wings, tailplane (or horizontal stabilizer) and three fuselage sections that will make up an A380 destined for Qatar Airways balance on a convoy of trucks in a large concrete lot. It's a surreal sight, especially in a rural field in southwestern France.

A grand itinerary

An impressive feat of logistics, the Itinéraire is almost as complicated as the giant A380 itself. Because the aircraft's parts are so enormous (see gallery) -- Itinéraire à Grand Gabarit roughly translates to ""oversize convoy route"" -- Airbus couldn't transport them to Toulouse by existing road or rail. (Only the A380's tail, produced in Germany, is small enough to fit inside the company's curious Beluga cargo aircraft.) Instead, the company had to devise a custom land-and-water route that brings the sections to the factory.

The Itinéraire begins at sea, where cargo ships pick up airplane sections from plants in the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain and elsewhere in France (see map) and transport them to the port of Pauillac on France's Atlantic coast. After a short trip on a barge down the Garonne River past Bordeaux to Langon, they're loaded on the truck convoy and driven 150 miles to Airbus' Toulouse headquarters. Much about the route, including the docks where the ships load and unload and the parking areas like the one where I'm standing, was designed and built from scratch.

To minimize traffic disruption, the convoy travels over two nights, laying over during the day in the guarded lots. To avoid overpasses it sticks mostly to country roads, but that creates other challenges. Traffic is briefly stopped when a convoy passes, trees are kept trimmed, and some road signs are temporarily removed. When the 23-foot-wide fuselage sections squeeze down the main street of small towns, they barely fit between the buildings on either side.

All of those things made the Itinéraire a spectator event when regular A380 production started in 2003. Fourteen years later, the twice-a month trips (each convoy carries the parts for one A380) attract little local notice. Now, it's only aviation geeks like me who agree to follow the convoy from 10 p.m. until 3 a.m.

On the road again

It's dark when we arrive at the last layover area near the town of Ordan-Larroque. The wings, sitting side by side on separate trailers, are entirely covered by a sort of shrink wrap, making them brilliantly white under the tall lights illuminating the lot. The three aluminum fuselage sections are mostly a pea-soup green color, while the horizontal stabilizer, partially made of composite material, is a pale yellow.

As we walk around to shoot photos and gawk, the convoy drivers take a smoke break or chat. I'd love to linger, but the stillness breaks quickly as the convoy begins to roar to life for the start of tonight's leg. Meanwhile, my group jumps into a van and races ahead so we can watch the parade pass by a few miles up the road. About 20 minutes later, we pull over pretty much in the middle of nowhere. It's a clear, pitch-black night with a gorgeous carpet of stars overhead. But soon, the silence is broken as the convoy's headlights appear around a bend. It takes about 15 minutes for the trucks to rumble by (the convoy can be up to a mile-and-a-quarter long) and the darkness returns.

It's extraordinary, but it also feels comfortably routine. Crew members on motorcycles smoothly pause traffic at intersections, a relatively simple task given the few cars on the road at this late hour. The delayed drivers don't raise a fuss as they're held back. Some barely look up from their phones. It's obvious that they've seen it all before.

Next, we speed ahead to our second viewing point in the village of Gimont, arriving around midnight. Aside from two spectators who briefly pull over to watch, there's no one around as the convoy snakes down a hill and across an old stone bridge at the entrance to town. Then, after slowly following the rear fuselage section through Gimont's narrow streets (the trucks travel between 6.2 and 15.5 miles per hour), we head back to our hotel around 1:30 a.m. The convoy continues on to Toulouse, rolling into Airbus' plant next to the city's airport about 3 a.m.

Under construction

The next morning we're on the floor of Airbus' massive A380 final assembly line. Compared with the busy, but well-orchestrated, activity of the night before, the bright and spotlessly clean factory is surprisingly calm. Just a handful of workers are visible, making it almost eerily quiet, but our Airbus guide tells us that this is the normal pace of work for lunchtime on a Friday.

Two almost-completed A380s, one destined for Emirates and another for Singapore Airlines, tower above us as they await installation of their engines. Outside, the aircraft look almost ready to fly, but inside they're still empty shells with cables and tubes stretching the length of the fuselage ceiling. It's a far cry from a finished airplane with passenger seats, but without any interior fittings the immense scale of the A380 is inescapable (the typical A380 layout fits 544 passengers, but the number varies depending on the customer). I could go bowling in here on a lane four times the normal length. You can buy one if you want; you just need a cool $437 million.

How big are the A380's parts?

Feet long Feet wide Feet high Wings 148.3 22.3 37.7 Forward fuselage 69.9 25.6 32.5 Center fuselage 76.1 25.6 33.1 Rear fuselage 75.5 25.6 32.5 Tailplane 90.2 23.6 44.9

The aircraft's size is equally apparent as we climb on top of the fuselage and stand under the 48-foot tail. From behind, the polished skin of the rudder reflects the factory's lights so brightly that it almost disappears when viewed from behind. Looking ahead, the A380 stretches on for another 200 or so feet and the 261-foot wingspan barely fits even in the wide-angle lens of my camera. I could spend all day clambering around this big beast, but my flight back to London on a significantly smaller Airbus A320 is inching closer.

Watch this: On the road with an Airbus A380 01:06

As we end the tour, the convoy we followed last night is resting outside the factory. Here, next to completed A380s and A350s parked in the bright sunshine, the sections look much more at home than they did passing a village boulangerie. By next week, they'll disappear into the factory for final assembly. And about eight months after that, the completed airliner will begin flying hundreds of passengers all over the world. But no matter how far it goes, it all started on the back of a truck in the French countryside.

Airbus Perlan Mission II reaches new high altitude in search for world aviation record - Airbus,"Wed, 02 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNy0wOC1haXJidXMtcGVybGFuLW1pc3Npb24taWktcmVhY2hlcy1uZXctaGlnaC1hbHRpdHVkZS1pbi1zZWFyY2gtZm9y0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"El Calafate, Argentina, August 2, 2017 – Airbus Perlan Mission II, an initiative to fly a glider without an engine to the edge of space to collect ground-breaking insights on climate change, weather and high-altitude flight, this week reached a new high altitude in its second season of flight testing in El Calafate, Argentina. Pilots Jim Payne, Morgan Sandercock, Tim Gardner and Miguel Iturmendi have soared the pressurized Perlan 2 glider in a series of flights reaching a maximum altitude to date of 32,500 feet.

El Calafate, in the Patagonian region of Argentina, is in one of a few places on earth where a combination of mountain winds and the polar vortex create the world’s highest “stratospheric mountain waves” – rising air currents that Perlan pilots believe can eventually carry their experimental aircraft to the edge of space.

Over the next two months, the all-volunteer exploration team sponsored by Airbus will seek for the rare waves in an attempt to break the world gliding altitude record of 50,727 feet, set by Einar Enevoldsen and Steve Fossett in Perlan 1 in 2006. Along the way, the aircraft will continue to collect scientific data on the atmosphere made possible by the Perlan 2 aircraft’s unique attributes.

“Just last month the world witnessed another reminder of the importance of understanding climate change, with the fracture from the Antarctic ice shelf of an iceberg the size of the state of Delaware,” said Perlan Project CEO Ed Warnock. “Airbus Perlan Mission II will allow us to study a range of atmospheric phenomenon that ultimately will give us more accurate models of our upper atmosphere and the climatic changes that matter to every world citizen.”

The engineless design of the Perlan 2 sail plane enables it to collect uncontaminated air samples from a range of altitudes. Unlike a weather balloon, it can be steered, can stay in one area, and can take off and land in the same location.

Besides studying factors influencing climate change, Airbus Perlan Mission II will also provide insights into high altitude turbulence and radiation effects on pilots and aircraft.

“As demand for air travel rises, and we are faced with questions about how to safely and more efficiently transport a growing population, the insights that Airbus Perlan Mission II will be collecting are invaluable,” said Allan McArtor, Chairman of Airbus Americas. “Perlan’s discoveries will help us shape the future of aerospace with innovations related to design and engineering, more efficient air travel and even aviation science related to travel on Mars.”

CHC takes delivery of first H175 aircraft - Airbus,"Wed, 02 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNy0wOC1jaGMtdGFrZXMtZGVsaXZlcnktb2YtZmlyc3QtaDE3NS1haXJjcmFmdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CHC takes delivery of first H175 aircraft

The delivery is supported by a nose-to-tail HCare services contract

02/08/2017 – CHC Helicopter will today take delivery of its first H175 for use in offshore oil and gas operations. The aircraft has been delivered in full offshore passenger transport configuration, allowing CHC to begin training and adjustment from the operator’s base at Aberdeen, ahead of operational launch in August 2017.

Based at CHC Helicopter’s site in Aberdeen, Scotland, the H175 has been configured to carry 16 passengers in offshore oil and gas configuration and will benefit from a nose-to-tail HCare services contract. The HCare contract will help maximise cost efficiencies through coverage for all spare parts and repairable items supplied from Airbus Helicopters’ North Sea Fleet Centre, also in Aberdeen.

Dave Balevic, Senior Vice President, Engineering and Operations at CHC Helicopter, said, “The H175 allows us to continue to refine our global fleet to meet the unique needs of our customers while offering the latest aircraft technology and capabilities.”

Today, a global fleet of 15 H175 have flown more than 12,000 hours, with 13 flying oil and gas missions – the majority of these in the North Sea with one operating in the Gulf of Mexico. The H175 has a maximum take-off weight (MTOW) of nearly 8 tonnes and is designed to provide unmatched efficiency across a range of missions, including utility, VIP transport, oil and gas and search and rescue. Equipped with Helionix, Airbus Helicopters’ integrated suite of advanced avionics and 4-axis autopilot, the H175 offers enhanced situational awareness and improved operational safety by helping to reduce pilot workload and increasing mission flexibility.

Ben Bridge, EVP Global Business at Airbus Helicopters said, “CHC will benefit from the enhanced flexibility the H175 offers, helping to smoothly and efficiently transport up to 16 passengers to North Sea offshore installations.” He added, “With full glass cockpit, automated systems, spacious cabin and large windows, the H175 represents a major achievement for AH, helping to raise the bar in terms of operational efficiency, safety and comfort in offshore operations”.

With virtually little or no vibration at cruise speeds of 150 knots and maximum speeds of 165 knots, the H175, already in operation with NHV, Pegaso, Babcock and Monacair and is playing a key role supporting the offshore oil and gas industry through the efficiencies that this flexible aircraft brings into service.

Cathay Pacific Group signs MOU for 32 A321neo aircraft - Airbus,"Mon, 21 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNy0wOC1jYXRoYXktcGFjaWZpYy1ncm91cC1zaWducy1tb3UtZm9yLTMyLWEzMjFuZW8tYWlyY3JhZnTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"World's most efficient single-aisle selected for fleet renewal at Cathay Dragon

Cathay Pacific Group has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Airbus for 32 A321neo single-aisle aircraft. The aircraft will be operated by Cathay Dragon, the regional carrier of the Group, on services linking its Hong Kong home base with destinations across Asia.

The new A321neo aircraft will replace and modernise Cathay Dragon’s current in-service fleet of 15 A320s and eight A321s, with the additional aircraft allowing the airline to capture growth opportunities in the region. The Cathay Dragon network currently covers 56 Asian destinations, including 28 in mainland China.

Cathay Pacific Chief Executive Officer and Cathay Dragon Chairman Rupert Hogg said: “The Airbus fleet has been serving Cathay Dragon well over the decades. With the A321neo we expect to benefit from a very significant increase in operating efficiency, while increasing capacity in the Cathay Dragon network in order to expand our reach to more customers.”

He added: “The intention to purchase these 32 environmentally-friendly aircraft will allow us to add new destinations to Cathay Dragon’s network, increase frequency on some of our most popular routes and expand our network in the region in order to provide more travel choices and convenience to our customers.”

John Leahy, Airbus Chief Operating Officer, Customers said: “Airbus is proud to have been selected to supply Cathay Dragon’s future single-aisle fleet. This is another major endorsement of the A321neo as the aircraft of choice in the middle-of-the-market segment.”

“The A321neo offers the lowest operating costs, longest range capability and most spacious cabin in its class. It will be the perfect aircraft for Cathay Dragon as it builds on its success as one of Asia’s leading regional carriers.”

Cathay Dragon is an all Airbus operator, with a current fleet of 23 A320 Family aircraft and 24 widebody A330-300s. In addition, Cathay Pacific operates 37 A330-300s, making the Group the largest A330 operator in the Asia-Pacific region. Cathay Pacific also operates the all-new long haul A350 XWB, with 17 A350-900s already in service. The carrier has another 31 A350 XWBs on order for future delivery, including the A350-900 and larger A350-1000.

The A321 is the largest member of the A320 Family and seats up to 240 passengers, depending on cabin configuration. Incorporating the latest engines, aerodynamic advances and cabin innovations, the A321neo offers a reduction in fuel consumption of up to 20 per cent per seat and can fly up to 4,000 nautical miles (7,400 kilometres) non-stop – further than any other single-aisle airliner.

The A320 Family is the world’s best-selling single-aisle product line and comprises four models (A318, A319, A320, A321) seating from 100 to 240 seats. To date, the Family has won over 13,200 orders and more than 7,700 aircraft have been delivered to some 400 customers and operators worldwide.

The line-up of international airlines flying to the U.S. mainland will grow this winter.

The latest to announce service is Hong Kong Airlines, which will launch non-stop flights between Los Angeles and Hong Kong on Dec. 18 on Airbus A350 aircraft. The airline will begin with four round-trip flights a week before moving to daily service on Jan. 16.

News of the L.A. route comes less than two months after Hong Kong Airlines began flying from Vancouver, its first North American destination.

Beyond its new North American routes, Hong Kong Airlines -- founded in 2006 -- flies from its Hong Kong hub to more than 30 destinations across Asia, Australia and New Zealand.

TODAY IN THE SKY: Hong Kong Airlines adds daily flights to Vancouver

“Following the success of the Vancouver route, we are excited to launch our first route in the continental United States and further expand our international network,” George Liu, Hong Kong Airlines’ chief marketing officer, said in a statement. “By strengthening the connection between North America and our Asia Pacific destinations, we can provide more options for American business, leisure, academic, and family travelers.”

Hong Kong Airlines will face competition from oneworld partners American and Cathay Pacific, which also fly non-stop on the route

TODAY IN THE SKY: American Airlines to add Los Angeles-Hong Kong non-stops (March 2016)

While Los Angeles will be the carrier’s first route to the mainland United States, it’s not its first to a U.S. territory. Hong Kong Airlines already flies to Saipan, part of the U.S.-controlled Northern Marianas Islands in the Pacific Ocean.

As for Hong Kong Airlines, the A350s it will use for the Los Angeles route will be brand new to its fleet. The carrier's first A350 made its maiden flight at Airbus' assembly line in Toulouse, France, just last week. It's the first of 15 A350s Hong Kong Airlines has on order and is expected to be delivered to the carrier by the end of the month.

"The Incredible, Impossible, Fake Airliners of YouTube - Popular Mechanics","Mon, 07 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvcHVsYXJtZWNoYW5pY3MuY29tL2ZsaWdodC9haXJsaW5lcy9hMjc0OTQvaW1wb3NzaWJsZS1wbGFuZXMtb2YteW91dHViZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"There is no such thing as a sextuple-decker Airbus A380. Obviously. You don't have to be an aviation expert to realize this sort of monstrosity could never get off the ground. Still, whenever I see one pop up on YouTube, I basically have to click it. That's the reason it even exists at all.

Impossible planes—Photoshopped Frankenstein aircraft with dozens of engines or ludicrous, bulbous fuselages—are all over YouTube. A quick search of ""world's largest plane"" will turn up dozens. Watch any one and you're like to find a montage of stolen, uncredited clips, slathered in dozens of ads and uploaded by shady accounts with names like ""STORM FORCE"" or ""Techno Blog."" Even with low-res video, egregious watermarking, and annoying pop-ups, these videos con their way into millions of views thanks in large part to the lie of their thumbnails.

Extreme and misleading cover art is a tale as old as YouTube. It used to require meticulous planning and shooting back when YouTube automatically selected thumbnails from a video's actual footage. But now that YouTube allows custom thumbnails that don't need to reflect a frame from the actual video, lying takes a lot less effort.

Big Planes, it turns out, are remarkably easy to lie about. Many of the world's actual largest actual planes look pretty unbelievable even without editing. The bulbous foreheads of the Airbus A300-600ST Beluga or the Aero Spacelines Super Guppy look a lot as if someone inflated them with software. The enormous Stratolauncher does look an awful lot like two smaller planes Photoshopped together. NASA's craziest X-planes look like someone copy and pasted in about a half-dozen extra propellers. On top of all this, the sheer blue background of a clear sky and the relatively blandness of an airliner's body makes it easy for even inexperienced Photoshoppers to create pretty believable modifications with little actual skill.

And so the fake planes are legion. In my travels across cyberspace as a Popular Mechanics blogger, I have discovered a few distinct families. Come with me on a journey.

Decked-Out Disasters

In real life, multideck airplanes top out at a maximum of two decks. Emirates has toyed with the idea of a triple decker but seemingly seriously and also in jest, but for now no such thing exists. In fact, air travel is trending toward smaller planes.

Fake planes, however, can have as many as six or seven decks, turning them into stretched-out flying flounders.

Multi-Engine Monstrosities

Another way to blow a plane way out of proportion is simply to add more engines onto the wings. In real life, engine record-holders include the WWI-era Dornier Do X flying boat with its 12 propellers and the octo-engined B-52. In bizarro YouTube world, those numbers climb much higher.

Multi-engined fake planes are usually based on a Soviet Antonov An-225 Mriya (an actual record-setting plane in length and weight), its form modified to fit as many engines as the wings have visual room for. Spacing and sizing errors are a dead giveaway, and absolutely hilarious to boot.

Stretched-Out Snafus

If five decks or two dozen engines is a little ostentatious for your fake-plane taste, then perhaps you prefer a simple lengthening. In reality, the longest airliner is the Boeing 747-8 at 250 feet, 2 inches. But YouTube thumbnails take that record and stretch it out much, much further, often leaving strangely-placed engines and wings, and sometimes adding a few more for good measure.

Conjoined calamyties

There's no law on the books that says a plane can only have one fuselage. One of the largest actual planes in actual existence—Stratolaunch's rocket-carrying monster-plane—uses a double-fuselage design to boast the world's longest wingspan. Maybe that's why Photoshoppers seem to think they can get away with just gluing two Boeings together at the wing.

Friedrichshafen, 16/08/2017 - Airbus successfully tests the dispenser structure that will hold the twin satellites GRACE-FO (GRACE = Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, FO= Follow-On) during their launch. Once the satellites are integrated in place, the assembly to the launcher or fit check test is carried out. This test is used to demonstrate the mechanical and electrical compatibility between the satellites, the dispenser, and the launcher. Airbus (Friedrichshafen / Germany) is developing and manufacturing the GRACE-FO satellites on behalf of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Airbus in Spain, a specialist in multi-payload structures for multiple launches, developed this satellite dispenser for the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ, Potsdam) in under one year. This structure was developed in classical configuration with a central carbon fibre cylinder with the satellites held in place by four hold down and release mechanisms which each have springs, connectors, and necessary harnesses.

JPL, located in Pasadena, California and managed by Caltech on behalf of NASA, in partnership with GFZ will send both GRACE-FO research satellites into a polar orbit at an altitude of around 500 km and at a distance of 220 km apart. This is a follow-on to the GRACE mission, which has been successfully operating since 2002. Both satellites will continually take very exact measurements of their separation distance, which changes depending on the Earth’s gravity. In this way, scientists are able to map the Earth’s gravitational fields.

SINGAPORE/PARIS (Reuters) - The first Airbus A380 superjumbo to fly passengers almost a decade ago has been taken out of service by Singapore Airlines , highlighting a debate over the future of the world's largest airliners.

Singapore Airlines has already said it plans to hand back its first A380 to a German leasing company rather than extend its 10-year lease.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

The move focused attention on slack demand for the 544-seat double-decker and raised the prospect that some could be headed for the breakup yard, casting a pall over celebrations to mark the airliner's 10 years of service in October.

Confirming a report in flightglobal.com, Singapore Airlines said it had parked the aircraft ahead of the transfer back to its owner. Its last commercial flight was to London in June.

""It is correct that the aircraft has been removed from service ahead of its return to the lessor in October,"" a spokesperson for the airline said by email.

""We are not in a position to comment on what is planned for the aircraft after it is returned to the lessor.""

The owner of the aircraft, Dortmund-based Dr Peters Group, and Airbus both declined to comment on the move.

The German owner says it is in talks with several entities who may be interested in the first aircraft, one of four due to come back from Singapore Airlines up to June next year.

In total the asset manager owns nine superjumbos including five leased to Air France .

These have been financed through the Kommanditgesellschaft (KG) market, a tax-efficient system best known for its appeal to high-income individuals.

Singapore Airlines continues to take delivery of new A380s which will be fitted with upgraded cabins.

But the problems in finding a new airline willing to operate the giant aircraft as they come off their initial leases have highlighted the lack so far of a fluid second-hand market.

That in turn weighs on fragile demand for new aircraft, which has twice forced Airbus to reduce production.

The race to find a new home for the first jet comes as Airbus tries to maintain confidence in the programme and negotiate deals for new jets at the Dubai Airshow in November.

While most airliners have an economic life of 25 years and are built to last even longer, the first A380 faces an uncertain future less than 10 years after it went into service in 2007, marking what European leaders hailed as a new era in air travel.

If Dr Peters cannot find a new operator, it is widely expected to break up the first one or two aircraft for parts.

Airbus insists the A380 does have a future due to congestion and predicts 5 percent of aircraft delivered over the next 20 years will be in the same category.

U.S. rival Boeing disagrees and stopped forecasting demand for very large four-engined airplanes such as the A380 and its own 747-8 in June.

In North America alone, Airbus employs approximately 5,300 people, but that’s just a small piece of the pie, as the company has a global force of 134,000 people.

So, what does it take for someone who has no background in aviation to join that global force? “We look specifically, at a given time, at certain qualities and classifications,” he told Rod McDermott of McDermott & Bull at AirVenture 2017. More simply put, the company looks for people with backgrounds in human resources, IT, finance and accounting, and procurement, among others.

More than anything, right now, Airbus has a hiring emphasis on IT and big data analytics, and specifically “the folks who can take big information and crunch it down into something our customers can use.” Additionally, as we learned in Oshkosh, Airbus Aerial is looking for people with backgrounds in unmanned drones to help this new venture grow.

Check out the entire video for all of McKenzie’s insight into what it takes to join a company like Airbus.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999969482421875}",neutral,0.999969482421875,0
Iran in talks to buy 48 Airbus helicopters - Egypt Today,"Sat, 12 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVneXB0dG9kYXkuY29tL0FydGljbGUvMS8xNjkyMS9JcmFuLWluLXRhbGtzLXRvLWJ1eS00OC1BaXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters H160 Flight Test campaign launched CC

DUBAI - 12 Aug 2017: Iran is holding talks with European planemaker Airbus to buy 48 helicopters for civilian use, an Iranian official was on Saturday quoted as saying, as Iran continues its shopping spree of Western aircraft after the lifting of sanctions.



""The Health Ministry is planning to order 45 HEMS (Helicopter Emergency Medical Service) helicopters and the purchase is being negotiated by the Ministry of Roads and Urban Development,"" Iran's Financial Tribune daily quoted Deputy Minister Asghar Fakhrieh-Kashan as saying.



""Ports and Maritime Organization is also planning to hold a tender to purchase three search-and-rescue helicopters,"" he added.



Airbus Helicopters, the world's largest commercial helicopter maker, was not immediately available for comment.



Iran has ordered more than 200 planes since international sanctions against the country were lifted last year in return for curbs on the country's nuclear activities.



Flag-carrier IranAir has ordered 100 planes from Airbus, 80 from U.S. rival Boeing (BA.N) and 20 ATR turboprops, but implementing the deals has been hampered by uncertainty over financing.



On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he did not believe that Iran was living up to the spirit of the 2015 deal to curtail its nuclear weapons programme. But it was not immediately clear whether Washington may take measures that could affect Tehran's plane purchases.



In June, Airbus said two other Iranian airlines had committed to buying 73 planes in a last-minute flurry of deals for the aircraft manufacturer at the Paris Airshow.



Fakhrieh-Kashan said Iran was holding negotiations to merge the helicopter order into the IranAir-Airbus contract signed in December, Financial Tribune reported.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998670816421509}",neutral,0.9998670816421509,0
Customer focus: US Coast Guard - Airbus,"Wed, 09 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE3LTA4LWN1c3RvbWVyLWZvY3VzLXVzLWNvYXN0LWd1YXJk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“A phenomenal service”

In 2016, US Coast Guard aviation celebrated its 100th anniversary. This service has an illustrious history helping with everything from war efforts to bolstering US borders in homeland security. Below, a closer look.

Article: Heather Couthaud - Photos: US Coast Guards

Article adapted from Rotor magazine.

They changed to orange for missions in the Arctic. Traditionally, US Coast Guard aircraft bear the distinctive “racing stripe” paint scheme – a white body marked with a red and blue stripe. Aboard ice-breakers in the Arctic, someone realised the Coast Guard needed a helicopter livery that would be visible against the snow. Today, its fleet of 100 MH-65* helicopters are painted a bold orange, a sign of the Coast Guard’s versatility in the face of need. Versatility serves in good stead; the Coast Guard is tasked with ensuring the United States’ maritime safety, security and stewardship. A military service and a branch of the armed forces, its missions include search and rescue, homeland security, environmental protection, the interdiction of illegal drugs and migrants, and the enforcement of fisheries laws.

A high volume of missions

It is a visibly huge service. With a total workforce of more than 87,000 – 40,000 of whom are on active duty – the Coast Guard’s presence is recognisable to nearly anyone who has seen its helicopters pass overhead or its boats buzz harbours. The huge ice breakers and cutters – 243 in total – are perhaps its most iconic symbols, yet its 2 groups of smaller “assets” – boats and aircraft – are more ubiquitous, accomplishing a high volume of varied missions. “The Coast Guard is a phenomenal service because we adapt to what is needed,” says Commander Scott Sanborn, operations officer and chief pilot of Air Station Houston. “Depending on the mission requirement, the Coast Guard is always ready to respond with an aircraft, a boat, a cutter, or a combination of assets. We will find a way to make it work.”

201 planes and rotorcraft comprise its airborne fleet. In 1985, the Coast Guard began procuring Aerospatiale HH-65 helicopters* and assigning them to air stations— bases serving a particular geographic region. As the Coast Guard’s primary short-range rescue aircraft, they are equipped with a rescue basket, hoist and sling, and, if necessary, a litter or dewatering pump. A SAR crew comprises 2 pilots, a flight mechanic, and an EMT rescue swimmer.



The Coast Guard service can call on more than 87,000 members, of whom 40,000 are on active duty.

“Carry a signalling device”

Over the course of an 18-year career in which he’s seen his share of rescues, Sanborn’s advice to boaters is: notify someone where you’ll be going and how long you’ll be out, carry a signalling device and wear a life jacket. Spotting a man overboard isn’t always easy. One such case occurred last year. Two fishermen in Galveston Bay went overboard when their boat swamped. The Coast Guard was alerted when the men didn’t arrive back when they were due. For two days, Coast Guard crews searched but, though they located the boat, they couldn’t find the men. On their last leg, with minimal fuel remaining, they spotted something from the window. “He was hanging onto an abandoned oil platform,” says Sanborn. “He’d spent two days there. Finally, he took off his shirt and got the crew’s attention by swinging it around over his head.” Sanborn adds that people who join the service do so because they want to help others. “In the Coast Guard, you get talented folks who are motivated to find a way. There’s a lot of creativity to come up with a solution.”

Airbus Reveals High-Speed Helicopter Project Racer - Robb Report,"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbW90b3JzL2F2aWF0aW9uL2FpcmJ1cy1oaWdoLXNwZWVkLWhlbGljb3B0ZXItcHJvamVjdC1yYWNlci0yNzMwNjc0L9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vcm9iYnJlcG9ydC5jb20vbW90b3JzL2F2aWF0aW9uL2FpcmJ1cy1oaWdoLXNwZWVkLWhlbGljb3B0ZXItcHJvamVjdC1yYWNlci0yNzMwNjc0L2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Helicopters have a great advantage over conventional airplanes—they can take off and land from small spaces like a city rooftop or a rural backyard. But they do have one drawback—they’re slow. Airbus Helicopters is working to change that with its new design concept, unveiled this summer at the Paris Air Show. Working with the European-wide Clean Sky 2 program that aims to create more efficient, quieter aircraft, Airbus is building the full-scale Racer, short for Rapid And Cost-Effective Rotorcraft, and plans to fly it by 2020. The one-of-a-kind technology demonstrator will try out a number of advanced features and will cruise at speeds up to 250 mph.

The aircraft has evolved from a previous experiment, the X3 prototype, which Airbus flew in 2013, setting a helicopter speed record of 293 mph in level flight. The new Racer brings the concept closer to a commercial design, and aims to demonstrate its speed and efficiency for a variety of missions. The boxy wing design, which also was tested on the X3, provides a boost to the main rotor’s lift when flying in cruise mode. During ground operations, the wing also helps to shield the passengers from the “pusher” rotors. Those rotors, which generate thrust in forward flight, are driven by two RTM322 engines, built by Safran Helicopter Engines, based in France. The engines also power the main rotor.

The experiment extends to the fuselage, which is built from hybrid metallic-composite materials, which are designed to be lightweight and easy to maintain. The Racer also uses a new high-voltage direct-current electrical generator, contributing a significant weight reduction compared to the current technology, according to Airbus. “The technical solution we have put forward is very appealing,” says Jean-Brice Dumont, head of engineering at Airbus Helicopters, “because it is simple and inexpensive. It is an illustration of perfect innovation, which is innovation based on reality.” A new commercial helicopter based on the Racer’s technology could be on the market by 2030.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9996065497398376}",positive,0.9996065497398376,1

TAP Air Portugal rolled out its latest special aircraft paint scheme last week, adding a new look to one its A330-300 planes.

The new livery is to promote TAP’s ""stopover"" program for passengers connecting through its bases in Lisbon and Porto. The program, which launched this time last year, allows customers transiting through those cities to stay for up to three days for no additional airfare. A longer 5-day stopover option has been added to trips beginning in in September 2017.

TAP says nearly 70,000 customers have already availed themselves of the three-day “Portugal Stopover” option.

“(But) we kept hearing that three days wasn’t enough to truly experience Lisbon or Porto,” Carlos Paneiro, TAP’s VP of Sales for North and Central America, says in a statement. “Now with five days, visitors can enjoy a more leisurely visit to really get to know what these wonderful cities have to offer.”

The stopover-themed livery is the second to be rolled out by the Portuguese carrier in recent weeks.

In June, TAP introduced a retro-themed paint scheme on another of its Airbus A330-300 jets. The airline says that livery recreates the original ""Transportes Aéreos Portugueses"" typography in the colors that were first displayed on a Lockheed Super Constellation aircraft received by TAP in July 1955. The last aircraft in that livery was a Boeing 727-200, according to TAP.

Toulouse, 10th August 2017 - The payload module of MetOp-C, developed and built by Airbus in Germany, was delivered to Toulouse after it completed a series of tests at ESTEC, the technical centre of the European Space Agency (ESA) in Noordwijk, the Netherlands. The satellite, weighing in at four tonnes, is now almost complete after successful coupling of its payload and service module. In preparation for the launch scheduled for October 2018 from Kourou, French Guiana, MetOp-C will undergo a further series of radio-electric tests in the coming weeks. The solar panel, which is the last outstanding major component, will be integrated in November 2017 just before vibration testing.

The MetOp satellites have been developed by Airbus for ESA and EUMETSAT, the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites, and are part of a joint European-US cooperation. EUMETSAT is responsible for operating the satellites. MetOp-A, the first satellite in the series, was launched in October 2006 and has since doubled its specified five-year service life. MetOp-B was launched into orbit in 2012 and is also about to exceed its design service life. Initially, the plan was that each satellite would replace its predecessor, however, the excellent performance of the first two MetOp satellites means that they can now be operated simultaneously, providing the meteorological community with increased data. The forthcoming launch of MetOp-C will further improve the quality of observations and data provided for weather forecasts.

Each MetOp satellite carries a total of 12 instruments, making the system extremely versatile. The microwave humidity sounder, built by Airbus, delivers data on water vapour near the Earth’s surface and is part of the collaboration with the US. As well as each MetOp satellite carrying the instrument, two more are flying on US NOAA satellites, delivering matching data from a different orbit to enhance weather models. MetOp also measures ocean surface winds, observes sea ice distribution and monitors the ozone layer in the stratosphere, as well as relaying meteorological measurements collected by boats, buoys and research stations. It also includes a receiver to relay signals sent by persons in distress.

MetOp has enhanced the accuracy of weather forecasting and allowed extending the short-term forecasts by one day.

"Airbus Highlights Strong Orders for July, Driven by the Success Of The A350 - AirlineGeeks.com","Sat, 12 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZWdlZWtzLmNvbS8yMDE3LzA4LzEyL2FpcmJ1cy1oaWdobGlnaHRzLXN0cm9uZy1vcmRlcnMtZm9yLWp1bHktZHJpdmVuLWJ5LXRoZS1zdWNjZXNzLW9mLXRoZS1hMzUwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"[ Airlines ] By Tomos Howells

July was another successful month for Airbus sales, being driven by the continued demand of its A350 aircraft. Airbus, which is now in its fourth year of production of the aircraft, has produced 100 of the A350s.

On July 25, Airbus confirmed that it had delivered its 100th A350 to Air China as part of a staggering 47 aircraft deliveries, and had secured $1 billion in orders from 23 different airlines in July alone. Airbus has also completed deliveries of 12 A320ceos, nine A320neos, 15 A321neos, four A330-300s, six A350-900s and one A380 as well, highlighting the continued demand and fulfillment of its fleet.

The month of July saw an additional six A350-900s go on order to an undisclosed buyer, as well as additional orders for other aircraft in the family. Breaking down the numbers, Airbus signed orders for 36 A320neos, four A330-300s, and one A380.

There was also an order placed by International Airlines Group (IAG) for an additional three A330-200s to be added to their current fleet of two A330-200’s which will be used for their new airline, Level, which is offering low-cost transatlantic services from Spain.

July saw another landmark for Airbus after it completed its first delivery of an A350-900 to an American company, Delta Air Lines. With the latest in orders and deliveries, Airbus is looking at an overall backlog of around 6,762 aircraft as of July 31, which means it will take an estimated nine years of production to complete the orders at the current rate.

The A350 has been a success for Airbus after what could be described as a disappointing sales record of the A380, which has seen numerous cutbacks and delays ever since it was launched. Airbus did unveil a new addition to the A380 family this year when it showcased the A380plus at the Paris Air Show in an attempt to boost sales for the jumbo jet. The updated aircraft offers its customers an additional 80 seats, and 14 percent better fuel efficiency.

Airbus has seen a much more successful investment in the A350 project, with the launch seeing a combined order of eight A350-800, 628 A350-900, and 212 A350-1000s since the aircraft became available for order back in 2006. This is a significant increase in the small number of orders that the manufacturer received for the A380 since its launch back in 2005.

Airbus outlines lofty ambitions with Perlan II glider - Flightglobal,"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MtYXZpYXRpb24vYWlyYnVzLW91dGxpbmVzLWxvZnR5LWFtYml0aW9ucy13aXRoLXBlcmxhbi1paS1nbGlkZXIvMTI1MjQ3LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Perlan II pilot Jim Payne plans to soar to 91,000ft in his Airbus-sponsored unpowered glider – but that was not the objective of a quick, 1h flight on 30 August in El Calafate, a rugged tourist destination in southern Argentina. Payne’s team had made several modifications to the Perlan II’s control system, and this flight simply verified that they worked.

The shake-out flight was well-timed. The rare combination of two meteorological phenomena – tidal wave-like wind currents flowing eastward over the Andes and a high-altitude jetstream spilling northward from Antartica – aren’t forecasted to unite over Patagonia for several more days. When those two stratospheric forces collide, it will give Payne’s team their best chance this year to break the soaring altitude record of 50,700ft set by the Perlan I in 2006.

“Around the 6th [of September] is looking good,” says Payne, the chief pilot for the Perlan II, which is funded by $7 million contributed by several donors, with the majority provided by Airbus.

The role of Perlan II’s chief benefactor goes beyond financial support. Payne’s flight on 30 August in El Calafate drew an audience of dozens, including Paul Eremenko, Airbus’s chief technology officer, and a number of international journalists.

The mission of Perlan II has few obvious benefits for a large aircraft manufacturer. To be sure, the Perlan II could spend significant time investigating turbulence-inducing mountain wave conditions above 50,000ft – an altitude that could rise in significance as manufacturers seek to avoid increasing congestion below 41,000ft. If the Perlan II successfully rises to 90,000ft, the pilots will encounter atmospheric conditions similar to those on the surface of Mars, which could generate aerodynamic data that informs the way Airbus designs future aircraft to explore the Red Planet.

But the Perlan II also symbolises Airbus’ recent philosophical break from industry tradition in research and technology programmes. With the appointment last year of Eremenko – a former Google executive and manager at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency – as CTO, Airbus has moved to a new strategy.

Rather than pushing discrete technologies steadily through a series of technology readiness levels (TRLs) from prototype to production, Airbus is now bundling multiple innovations onto a new series of flying demonstrators.

“Let’s develop what could be a minimum viable product. Let’s fly it,” says Eremenko, speaking in El Calafate.

The industry’s time-tested TRL process still works for shepherding aerostructures and engines from development to production, but is less suited for advancing new technologies with shorter lifespans, such as software applications and electronics, Eremenko says.

“Electrical and software timescales are different. I think they lend themselves more to this kind of iterative process,” he adds.

Stephen Trimble/FlightGlobal

This approach has spawned a new Airbus technology roadmap, which Eremenko outlined in June. The plan includes many projects launched by Eremenko’s predecessors, but also features new experimental X-planes, such as Project Vahana, which will test new advances in electric propulsion, distributed propulsion and autonomous flight control.

“Perlan is obviously not a part of that, but the spirit is similar, where it’s much more open to the outside world,” Eremenko says.

“So we want to find the adventurous spirits who are passionate about a particular technology. It might not be trying to soar to the edge of space. It might be demonstrating electric technology or autonomous technology or something else.”

The Perlan II was conceived by aviation adventurers such as the late Steve Fossett and Einar Enevoldsen, who piloted the original Perlan glider (a modified Glaser-Dirks DG-500) to set the current soaring altitude record 11 years ago near El Calafate.

After Fossett’s death the following year, the project struggled to obtain the funds necessary to design a glider that could soar even higher into the stratospheric winds. Finally, Airbus chief executive Tom Enders agreed to support the project in 2014, allowing the Perlan II to travel to El Calafate in 2016 for the first time.

Unfortunately, this attempt to break the altitude record began just as Patagonia experienced a two-year low in occurrences of the Polar Night Jet, the jetstream-like wind current created by Antartica’s Polar Vortex. The Perlan II needs to seek out the Polar Night Jet to fly beyond the effect created by the Andes mountain wave, which can only lift the glider to about 50,000-60,000ft.

But Payne’s team of volunteers will be ready if the Polar Night Jet returns over Patagonia as expected in early September. And the team will not give up if the winter season ends a few weeks later without a record-breaking flight. They can try again in the Sierra Nevadas in the Northern Hemisphere’s winter season, or perhaps return again to El Calafate next year.

This major milestone within the Galileo Ground Control System (GCS) project means that all the received satellite telemetry data and the Key Management devices that secure the communication channel between the satellites and the ground the Galileo Ground Control Operations can now be fully shared between the two centres.

Approval of this link is an essential step in the programme. It marks the transition to a fully redundant Control Centre solution, even in the event of an emergency or failure at one of the centres, there is now the capability to continuously control the Galileo constellation from the other.

Galileo is Europe’s own global satellite navigation system, providing positioning, navigation and timing services to Europe and the world. It currently comprises 18 operational in orbit satellites, eight more that are built but still to be launched (four of these on an Ariane 5 launch in December) and another eight now on order. The system has been providing Initial Services since December 2016, providing high accuracy navigation signals to anyone with a ‘Galileo-ready’ chipset.

The Galileo Ground Segment is one of the most complex Europe has ever undertaken, having to achieve strict levels of security and safety whilst continuously monitoring and controlling all the satellites in the Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) constellation. Many of the routine satellite contacts are now fully automated.

Airbus in Portsmouth has been the prime contractor for the Galileo Ground Control Segment (GCS) from its inception to the present day, with responsibility for the GCS facilities located at both Oberpfaffenhofen and Fucino and the six associated Telemetry, Tracking and Command (TTC) stations. GCS is responsible for the day-to-day monitoring and control of the four In-Orbit Verification (IOV) satellites and the 12 Full Orbit Constellation (FOC) satellites and is ready to control all the FOC satellites as they become available. For FOC, Airbus has introduced more modern capabilities, such as the use of Virtualisation techniques, to both allow a more efficient use of hardware and also to reduce the impact of obsolescence, by allowing the running of legacy Operating System software on upgraded servers.

Looking beyond the current FOC contract, the Airbus GCS team is ready to introduce yet more innovative techniques to better support future operations of the current and next generation Galileo satellites.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9939461350440979}",neutral,0.9939461350440979,0

On Sunday, Delta Air Lines took delivery of its very first next generation Airbus A350-900 airliner.

Delta's first A350 arrived at its base in Atlanta just after 2:00 am on Sunday following a delivery flight from Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France.

Upon arrival, the plane was greeted by a ceremonial water cannon salute before pulling up to a gate.

The new wide-body jet is one of the 25 A350s Delta ordered in 2014 and is the first of five Airbus will deliver to the airline this year.

In May, Delta announced that it is deferring delivery of 10 A350s by at least two to three years.

The Airbus A350 entered service in early 2015 with Qatar Airways and is now in operation with roughly a dozen airlines around the world. However, Delta will be the aircraft's first operator in North America.

Airbus A350 Delta

With room for 306 passengers, Delta's A350s are expected to take over many of its trans-Pacific flights currently operated by its aging fleet of 747-400 jumbo jets. Delta's fleet of 747s, which were inherited from Northwest Airlines following their 2008 merger, has been in service an average of 26 years and is set to be retired at the end of the year.

The A350-900 is powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce Trent XWB turbofan engines each producing 84,000 lbs. of thrust. The aircraft is optimized for efficient long-haul flying and boasts a range of 8,000 miles.

Delta Airbus A350

Inside, the jet will have room for 32 private Delta One suites, 48 new Delta premium economy seats, and 226 main cabin seats. All cabins will have wi-fi connectivity, USB charging, and personal in-flight entertainment. In addition, the A350's carbon fiber reinforced plastic fuselage allows the cabin to be pressurized to mimic conditions at 6,000 feet of altitude, allowing for a more comfortable ride.

Over the next couple of months, Delta will prepare the A350 for its inaugural commercial flight from Detroit to Tokyo-Narita International Airport on October 30.

3D Systems teams with Airbus Defence and Space to produce metal AM satellite RF filter - Metal Additive Manufacturing magazine,"Thu, 24 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ldGFsLWFtLmNvbS8zZC1zeXN0ZW1zLXRlYW1zLWFpcmJ1cy1kZWZlbmNlLXNwYWNlLXByb2R1Y2UtbWV0YWwtc2F0ZWxsaXRlLXJmLWZpbHRlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Share to your network:









3D Systems’ Leuven division, Belgium, has partnered with Airbus Defence and Space in Stevenage, UK, to deliver what it states is the first flightworthy metal additively manufactured radio frequency (RF) filter for a telecommunications satellite. According to 3D Systems, the use of metal Additive Manufacturing allowed the companies to achieve a weight reduction of 50% compared to traditionally manufactured RF filters.

Metal RF or waveguide filters have been in use since the introduction of space communication systems nearly fifty years ago. RF filters act as ‘wave guides’ by allowing frequencies from selected channels to pass through, and rejecting frequencies from signals outside those channels. High-capacity telecommunication satellites can sometimes carry as many as 500 RF filters incorporating more than 600 waveguides, many of which are custom-designed to handle specific frequencies.

3D Systems’ metal additively manufactured RF filter was developed with funding from the European Space Agency as part of its project on the ‘Modelling and design of optimised waveguide components utilising 3D manufacturing techniques’. News of the successful testing and validation of this part follows a trend of increasing metal AM use in the aerospace industry, with the technology rapidly making steps from prototyping to production parts and assemblies ready for flight.

The major goal of this project was to increase the performance, production efficiency and customisation capabilities for RF filters on modern telecommunications satellites, and to produce a part which would pass the rigorous testing imposed by Airbus Defence and Space. Sending a satellite into geo-stationary orbit can cost as much as $20,000 per kilogram of its weight; therefore, every new satellite part designed must also be as light as possible.

3D Systems developed the new RF filter for production in its ProX® DMP 320, a laser powder bed Additive Manufacturing system which it refers to as a Direct Metal Printer. As well as achieving a 50% weight reduction, the company was able to consolidate the filter from two parts into one, improve its functionality by incorporating an internal structure not possible to manufacture via traditional means, reduce production time and lower production costs for customised designs.

RF filters have traditionally been designed using libraries of standardised elements dictated by the limitations of the manufacturing process, such as rectangular cavities and waveguide cross-sections with perpendicular bends. Using manufacturing processes such as milling and spark eroding, these shapes have traditionally been achieved by machining each RF filter in two halves, which are then bolted together. This increases weight, adds an assembly step to production time and requires additional quality assessment.

In designing the part for AM, 3D Systems and Airbus Defence and Space were able to explore complex geometries at no additional manufacturing cost. The new RF filter design features an internal structure based on a series of depressed super-ellipsoidal cavities. According to 3D Systems, this unique internal structure, which could not have been achieved through traditional manufacturing techniques, enables the part to channel and reject RF currents of different wavelengths with the minimum energy loss possible.

In some cases, the difference in surface topology between metal additively manufactured and traditionally manufactured parts may be a concern. While the microscopic topology of machined parts usually includes sharp peaks and troughs, the spherical powders used in metal AM result in a smoother, ‘waved’ topology, as opposed to steep transitions. However, after x-ray CT scanning by Airbus Defence and Space, the metal AM RF filter was reported to have a good general surface quality for its purpose, with the advantages of its internal structure outweighing any potential disadvantages posed by its surface topology.

During testing to mimic the conditions an RF filter would face during launch and in orbit, including vibration, shock, temperature extremes and vacuum conditions, Airbus Defence and Space reported that all test samples exceeded requirements, with the best performance coming from an RF filter which was silver-plated via an electrolytic process after manufacturing.

Paul Booth, RF engineer for Airbus Defence and Space, stated, “The success of this project opens up the possibility of much greater integration of RF filters with mechanical and thermal components to reduce part count and overall mass. We will also look at integrating more functionality, such as test-couplers, as part of the filter or directly integrated into waveguide runs. There is a huge potential here for reducing mass while cutting production time and costs.”

It will support a smooth entry into service for CHC’s first medium-twin H175.

CHC Helicopter has signed an HCare services contract to cover the operator’s H175 helicopter, based in Aberdeen, Scotland. Under this nose to tail contract, Airbus Helicopters is entrusted with providing all spare parts and repairable items for CHC’s H175.

“As we introduce these new aircraft to our fleet, we needed to make sure we were offering both our operations and customers as much certainty as possible,” said Dave Balevic, senior vice president, engineering and operations at CHC Helicopter. “The HCare Smart plan allows us to make sure we have the parts we need on hand as we integrate the H175 into our global operation.”

As one of the leading helicopter operators for, notably, oil and gas exploration in the North Sea, CHC provides offshore transportation to the oil and gas industry, emergency medical services (EMS) and search and rescue (SAR) operations, training and maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) services.

Thanks to this HCare contract, CHC will also benefit from the support of the Airbus Helicopters Fleet Center in Aberdeen, which provides access to a dedicated local stock of parts to ensure maximum reactivity. This stock is accessible 24/7 to ensure parts are available when needed.

“We are very proud of CHC’s confidence in our HCare FBH program to deliver high fleet availability,” says Matthieu Louvot, executive vice-president support & services at Airbus Helicopters. “It positions CHC for a very successful operation in Aberdeen backed by Airbus Helicopters’ total commitment.”

As part of its commitment to quality and performance, Airbus Helicopters’ HCare services offer provides the rotorcraft industry’s most comprehensive service coverage, grouped into five domains. Among them, HCare Material Management offers three different service packages: HCare Infinite, with a full availability commitment; HCare Smart, with four by-the-hour options; and HCare Easy, with on-request catalog services.

As one of the key services introduced by the HCare Smart offer, the FBH contract comprises the supply of spare parts and consumables, on top of parts-by-the-hour (PBH) coverage. It bundles in one single contract the provision of all parts needed for the maintenance of the aircraft, leading to better cost control and forecasting, coupled with easier day-to-day management for operators.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9975345134735107}",neutral,0.9975345134735107,0
Airbus sets sights on space with first 3D Systems printed RF satellite filter - 3D Printing Industry,"Wed, 16 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vM2RwcmludGluZ2luZHVzdHJ5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1zZXRzLXNpZ2h0cy1zcGFjZS1maXJzdC0zZC1zeXN0ZW1zLXByaW50ZWQtcmYtc2F0ZWxsaXRlLWZpbHRlci0xMjAxNjkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The latest development from a collaboration between 3D Systems and Airbus proves that space is the place for 3D printing.

In the redesign of a radio frequency (RF) filter engineers have managed to bypass surface topology concerns and cut the weight of a part by 50%.

The metal component is now the first tested and validated part of its kind for commercial use in telecommunications satellites, used to feed television, phone and internet signals around the world.

The price of space

RF filters are responsible for the transmission and reception of wave frequencies. They have been an integral part of every in-space communication system since invention.

To meet a global demand for internet connectivity, broadband providing satellites now include around 500 RF filters, designed to last from 10 to 15 years.

The tax for sending objects into space is determined by weight. A geo-stationary telecoms satellite, like the KA-SAT manufactured by Airbus Defence and Space, costs around $20,000 per kilogram to launch.

Consequently, reducing the amount of material used to make the equipment has become an primary concern for aerospace engineers.

A case of form follows function

With direct metal printing there is very little material waste. Designs that would typically appear as a block of metal can be topologically optimized to make more geometrically complex shapes.

“This project is a classic example of ‘form follows function,” says Koen Huybrechts, project engineer at 3D Systems, “The disruptive innovation lies in the fact that pure functionality, not manufacturability, now determines how the hardware will be designed.”

Though the exterior of Airbus’ 3D printed RF is still a block, its interior and fit with the existing framework has been fine tuned.

Inside lies a channel with undulating, ovoid shapes chambers that would be impossible to make with traditional manufacturing.

Topology concerns

The surface structure of metal 3D printed parts is critical to qualification.

Paul Booth, project engineer for Airbus Defence and Space, explains, “Machined surfaces have sharp peaks and troughs, while the 3D printed surface is spheroids melted together so there is less sharpness.”

In this case, optimizing the part for more effective signal filtering outweighs any issues with surface topology.

Silver linings

Three sample RF filters, 3D printed by 3D Systems in aluminium, all met or exceeded flight-ready requirements, with a silver plated component coming out on top.

Booth continues “We were very pleased with the work that 3D Systems did for us and many inside Airbus have commented on how good the surface finish is.”

“We did some x-ray CT scans and have been impressed with the density of the part and the general surface quality.”

Back down to Earth

Within the Earth’s atmosphere, Airbus has previously achieved qualification of metal 3D printed parts for use in its commercial airplanes. Industrial and mechanical engineering company Liebherr is responsible for making the 3D printed spoiler actuator valve block inside the wings of an A380.

Stratasys has also invested over $15 million dollars in the company, and standardized the use of ULTEM plastic for the interior of the A350 XWB aircraft.

""If not corrected, the condition can lead to an uncontrolled overheat of the hydraulic fluid, possibly resulting in the ignition of the fuel-air mixture in the tank,"" EASA warned.

Germany's flagship carrier, Lufthansa, reported Wednesday it had taken precautionary measures to prevent that from happening, adding its four A350 aircraft were being closely monitored.

A planned software update for the pump was being thoroughly tested, the airline said, adding it would be installed shortly at the carriers using the affected planes.

Airbus noted the software update would do the trick for the moment, mentioning that the company was mulling a design change for the pump long-term.

The A350 family has been competing with Boeing's 737 Dreamliner. So far, Airbus has delivered some 100 aircraft of the A350-900 model.

BERLIN (AP) — German carrier Lufthansa says a travel battery belonging to a passenger caused a small fire aboard a trans-Atlantic flight to the United States last week, but crew members were swiftly extinguished the blaze and nobody was harmed.

The airline said Tuesday that the fire occurred Aug. 2 on board an Airbus A380 carrying 386 passengers and 24 crew from Frankfurt to Houston.

It said the battery, a power bank used to charge mobile devices, caught fire after falling beneath a seat. Lufthansa routinely warns passengers to avoid letting electronic devices get trapped in seats or tables.

ELSE raises $3 million for Internet of Things nanosatellite constellation - SpaceNews,"Thu, 10 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9lbHNlLXJhaXNlcy0zLW1pbGxpb24tZm9yLWludGVybmV0LW9mLXRoaW5ncy1uYW5vc2F0ZWxsaXRlLWNvbnN0ZWxsYXRpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LOGAN, Utah — A Swiss company with plans to deploy 64 cubesat-class spacecraft by 2021 to support Internet of Things applications has raised an initial $3 million funding round.

ELSE announced Aug. 8 that it closed the $3 million seed round with several investors, led by Airbus Ventures, the early-stage investment arm of Airbus Group, that will support the company through the deployment of two demonstration spacecraft next year.

“We have a strong group of investors, and certainly having Airbus Ventures behind us is really big,” said Kjell Karlsen, chief financial officer of ELSE, in an Aug. 8 interview here. “That could also lead to some potential industrial cooperation.”

“We believe in the development of machine-to-machine communications and we have been convinced by the cost-effective innovative satellite constellation and network technology which ELSE will be providing,” Francois Auque, chairman of the board of Airbus Ventures, said in a statement about the funding round. “We are happy to foster further cooperation between ELSE and Airbus.”

ELSE will use the funding round, as well as existing awards from the European Space Agency and the Swiss government, to complete development of the first two satellites in its Astrocast system. “This seed round allows us to do that,” Karlsen said. “That will take us through the demonstration missions next year.”

Assembly of those first two satellites, three-unit cubesats, has started, he said, as the company moves into a new, larger headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. ELSE has arranged with Seattle-based Spaceflight for the launch of one of them, and is finalizing a contract for a separate launch of the second.

“We’re moving forward and hitting all of our targets for our launches next year,” he said.

Those demonstration satellites will be followed by a constellation of 64 satellites, which Karlsen said will begin in the first quarter in 2019. Those satellites will be launched eight at a time into separate planes to provide global coverage. ELSE expects the constellation to be complete by 2021 at a total cost of less than $50 million.

That low development cost, he said, a key selling point for the Astrocast system and its communication services. “A lot of interest is from guys who were not necessarily thinking about satellites because they had this perception that satellite services were too expensive,” he said.

Karlsen said ELSE has agreements with three European companies to serve as pilot customers for the demonstration satellites. Those companies are in the marine, fishing and mobile industries. “As more news comes out about our application, we see a huge interest from a lot of industries that we never thought about,” he said.

He added that he expects the company’s partnership with Thuraya, the mobile satellite operator, will help identify additional customers. While Thuraya did not participate in the funding round, it is supporting ELSE with sales and regulatory issues.

ELSE is already started planning for a larger Series A round needed for the development of the full-scale constellation. Karlsen said most of the investors in the seed round have already committed to participating in the Series A round, which he expects to close in 2018.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9991782307624817}",neutral,0.9991782307624817,0
A Week of Ups and Downs for the Airbus A380 - AirlineGeeks.com,"Sun, 27 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZWdlZWtzLmNvbS8yMDE3LzA4LzI3L2Etd2Vlay1vZi11cHMtYW5kLWRvd25zLWZvci10aGUtYWlyYnVzLWEzODAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"[ Planes ] By Parker Davis

This week has certainly been a seesaw of a week for the Airbus A380. The current title holder for the world’s largest passenger aircraft saw both the good and the really ugly over the last seven days, leaving many to wonder what the future holds for “the whale.”

Some Refreshed, Some Removed from Service

Sydney-based Qantas Airways announced on Friday their fleet of 12 A380 aircraft would be receiving a refresh in 2019 and 2020. The changes mainly affect the cabin layout, as the airline will be doing away with the small economy class section on the upper deck and instead adding six more business class seats and 24 more premium economy seats.

The airline also announced numerous other enhancements. In first class, passengers can expect refurbished seats, better bedding options, and larger IFE screens. In premium economy, the airline’s new seat will be installed, widening the current seat by 10 percent and allowing for increased comfort. In economy, the seats will be refinished and will feature improved in flight entertainment.

Business class, however, will be completely transformed as the airline introduces the same seat that is currently slated to be introduced on their Boeing 787 aircraft. These fully-flat, staggered-configuration seats will feature aisle access from every seat, which represents an improvement from the current 2-2-2 configuration on the airline’s A380s.

Earlier in the week, news began to circulate regarding a Singapore Airlines A380 that has been parked since early June. The airline then confirmed the aircraft is undergoing “de-lease work before returning to the lessor.”

The lessor, Dr. Peters Group, is also expected to sell the first two A380 aircraft they get back from Singapore for parts, meaning the world’s third and fifth whales will soon be the first scrapped, merely a decade after they first entered service.

A Polarizing Aircraft

This week, the world saw just why the A380 is such a polarizing aircraft when it comes to operators. Some, including Emirates – an operator of nearly 100 of the aircraft – seemingly cannot get enough of the aircraft and all it does for their bottom line. But some, such as Singapore, struggle to find the sweet spot.

Emirates, headquartered in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, represents the A380’s best success story. The backbone and flagship of their fleet, the aircraft has truly made the ultimate hub-and-spoke model possible.

With one super-hub and nearly 150 destinations to serve, the airline has for nearly a decade relied on the giant aircraft to operate dozens of daily flights, helping to lead to a profit of over $2 billion in the fiscal year that ended in March 2016.

Qantas also expects to take delivery of eight more A380s in the next few years. The Aussie aircraft operate some of the airline’s longest flights, including their flights from Sydney and Melbourne to the U.S.

The aircraft even allowed the airline to operate their longest flights, QF7 and 8 from Sydney to Dallas and back, without stopping in Brisbane, Australia on the return, something that had caused the route to cost much more than it otherwise had to.

For the majority of the 11 other A380 operators, the aircraft has allowed them to operate high-density flights to some of the world’s busiest airports. For numerous airlines, the aircraft has enabled better access to the heavily slot restricted London Heathrow Airport, though that is merely one of many examples.

Slowing Production

In recent months, however, the A380 has taken hits from all sides as Airbus announced they would further slow down production of the aircraft at their plant in Toulouse, France. And with the first of the fleet to be taken out of service in the coming months, it may seem as though the young aircraft is nearing an untimely demise.

However, huge proponents of the airline still exist across the globe. Operators in Europe, all over Asia, and in Australia continue to fly the aircraft to six continents, and Airbus even claims an A380 takes off or lands an average of every three minutes somewhere in the world.

As of July 2017, just over 100 of the aircraft remain to be delivered (46 of which will go to Emirates), meaning just over two thirds of the total orders have been filled to date. But by 2019, the airline will be producing just one aircraft every six weeks in an effort to keep the lights on in Toulouse just a little while longer.

By further pushing out the schedule, Airbus has done just about everything it can to keep their A380 program alive. Now, it’s all up to the airlines to keep the king of the skies where it should be: airborne.

Vahana is a tilt wing electric air vehicle developed by Airbus’s Silicon Valley subsidiary A3 (pronounced A cubed). Airbus says the eight engine short-range electric aircraft will ‘help usher in a future in which urban air mobility (UAM) transforms daily life for billions of people’.

The tests will be conducted at Eastern Oregon regional Airport, US, where A3 has a hangar.

Major full-scale components for Vahana have been produced, including wings, fuselage, avionics components and actuators, and A3 has ‘begun full-scale vehicle integration’ of these.

Wired reports the aircraft will fly and land autonomously using inertial reference, lidar and GPS.

A3 speaks of ‘a fleet of millions of Vahanas’ that could eliminate slow, congested ground-based commuting. ‘Even addressing a fraction of a percent of this market would result in the highest aircraft production rates in history — not to mention the time and energy it will save commuters,’ it says.

Flight Safety Australia’s September-October edition, published online next week, examines progress in electric aircraft and investigates whether these are the next stage of aviation’s evolution or a dead end with parallels to 1960s predictions of widespread supersonic travel.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999892711639404}",neutral,0.9999892711639404,0

Qantas challenges Boeing and Airbus for more range - Airline Ratings,"Thu, 24 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyYXRpbmdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3FhbnRhcy1jaGFsbGVuZ2VzLWJvZWluZy1haXJidXMtcmFuZ2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Qantas is challenging Boeing and Airbus to refine their latest ultra-long-range jets to enable the airline to fly virtually anywhere in the world non-stop.

The Australian airline wants to be able fly non-stop between the east coast of Australia to London and New York within five years.

Qantas will announce its aircraft wish list as part of its 2017 results announcement in Sydney on Friday August 25.

The airline said in a statement that “no aircraft currently in service has the range to fly these direct routes with passengers and luggage at full capacity.”

“Two next-generation aircraft that are currently in development – Boeing’s 777X and a long-range version of Airbus’ A350 (the -900ULR)– can get close.”

“Qantas has issued a challenge to both Airbus and Boeing to extend the range of the new aircraft under development and make these non-stop flights possible by 2022,” the statement said.

Both the 777X and A350 series offer significant improvements in passenger comfort, fuel burn and range over the aircraft they are replacing.

Qantas is keen to develop more non-stop routes after the surge of bookings for the Perth to London Boeing 787 non-stop service that will start in March.

A direct flight from Melbourne / Sydney / Brisbane to London would cut up to four hours off total passenger journey time to just over 20 hours and three hours for a direct flight to New York.

The airline said customer research showed that the transit stop airport experience is often one of the most stressful parts of the journey, particularly where a connecting flight is involved.

“Direct flights reduce interruptions mid-flight which often interfere with sleeping, eating or movie watching,” the airline said.

Qantas said “that removing the need to stop at a particular airport en-route also means airline flight planners can choose the fastest and most efficient route between Australia and London/New York depending on weather and prevailing winds.”

As part of its feasibility assessment, Qantas is already running wind route analysis using the power of cloud computing.

This involves processing up to 10 years’ worth of real-world weather patterns to run different flight path scenarios to form a statistical picture of fuel burn and therefore aircraft range on the key routes.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9994857311248779}",neutral,0.9994857311248779,0
Emirates Launches Its Revamped Onboard Bar and Lounge as 96th Airbus A380 Takes to the Skies - paddleyourownkanoo.com,"Tue, 01 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhZGRsZXlvdXJvd25rYW5vby5jb20vMjAxNy8wOC8wMS9lbWlyYXRlcy1sYXVuY2hlcy1yZXZhbXBlZC1vbmJvYXJkLWJhci1sb3VuZ2UtOTZ0aC1haXJidXMtYTM4MC10YWtlcy1za2llcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Late last week Emirates took delivery of its 96th Airbus A380 – the new aircraft features the airline’s revamped on board bar and lounge. The delivery marked nine years since the Dubai-based airline received its first double decker A380 from European aircraft manufacturer, Airbus. The aircraft went into service today on the Dubai to Kuala Lumpur route – again marking the ninth anniversary of Emirates A380 operations.

The legendary onboard lounge has become synonymous with Emirates’ award-winning service and the new look is set to take the levels of luxury up a notch yet again. Said to be inspired by private yacht cabins, the airline claims the new lounge “features a more intimate and social area” for passengers to relax and mingle.

News of the improved lounge was first released in February and then shown to the public at industry trade show, ITB Berlin. Sir Tim Clark, president of Emirates said of the improved design: “In our latest revamp, we have taken inspiration from private yacht cabins, and amongst other thoughtful touches, we have increased the seating space, and also made it more intimate and conducive for our passengers to socialise or enjoy our lounge service.”

The enhancements include:

More seating – can now comfortably accommodate 26 guests with 8 seated.

Lighter champagne colours, accented by a glossy dark wood trim.

Soundproof curtains.

Soft ambient lighting options.

New window blinds with integrated LED mood lighting.

Subwoofers for surround sound.

a 55-inch LCD television screen with live programming.

But what’s the point of having an on board lounge if you can’t get a good drink and bar snack? Luckily, Emirates has that covered – the airline now has 6,000 business class crew trained as mixologists – able to create 14 different cocktails at 40,000 feet including the airline’s signature Bloody Mary. Also on offer are Hennessy XO Cognac and Chivas Regal 18-year-old Scotch whisky.

For those lucky enough to travel in Emirates Business or First Class there’s no chance of going hungry should you feel peckish midflight. There are 18 different bar snacks available – the most popular is said to be the smoked salmon bagels and fresh fruit skewers.

The airline now operates its A380 to 48 destinations with Sao Paulo, Casablanca and Nice joining the network this year. However, not all is good news for the Emirates A380. Airline execs were forced to postpone the delivery of 12 aircraft over the next two years – Allegedly because of unspecified problems with the Rolls Royce engines that are due to be used.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9663134813308716}",neutral,0.9663134813308716,0

According to the latest information the airport was closed for 4 hours. The aircraft is still grounded.

An experienced pilot told luchtzak.be that a go-around would have been more appropriate as the aircraft was “losing lateral control”, flying a few more holding patterns while the weather is clearing up is a good idea.

The Airbus A350-900 has only entered Air Caraïbes’ fleet in March this year.

Airframers can't shift all responsibility for narrowing seats - Runway Girl Network,"Sun, 13 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTcvMDgvYWlyZnJhbWVycy1jYW50LXNoaWZ0LWFsbC1yZXNwb25zaWJpbGl0eS1mb3ItbmFycm93aW5nLXNlYXRzLW9udG8tYWlybGluZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In January 2015, RGN published an article entitled “Why I tell people to avoid flying on a 787“. Two and a half years later, the piece remains one of RGN’s most perennially read — and commented upon — articles. Indeed, over a hundred passengers have expressed their agreement, solidarity and relief that they were not the only ones to find the much-vaunted aircraft tight in the 3-3-3 economy class configuration that most airlines operate.

One frequent counterpoint to the commentary, however, is that the narrow seats as found on a nine-abreast 787 or ten-abreast 777 are the fault of the airlines, not the airframer. The logic is that airlines have a choice of what kind of seats to select on their Dreamliners. Some (well, one: JAL) choose comfort over density. On the face of it, that is a tempting assertion — from the airlines’ point of view, anyway.

But the fact is that Boeing and Airbus cannot wash their hands of the matter like some sort of PaxEx Pontius Pilate. Both companies have designed their aircraft — and let’s be clear, these are conscious decisions made by top-notch professionals within the last thirty years — to give airlines a particular set of binary choices on their widebodies.

And the choices offered by Boeing and Airbus are different.

In discussing them, let’s talk about four different categories of seat:

A: relatively wide

B: relatively comfortable

C: uncomfortably narrow

D: ultra-narrow

These categories can be assigned to fuselage cross-sections much more easily than they can seat widths, because seat width is a number which can be fudged because there’s no standard way of measuring it.

The lack of a width standard (to a much greater extent than the problem of comparing pitch in a highly engineered #PaxEx world where new slimline seats can feel roomier than older models) means that the width of the seat as stated by the airframer, airline or seatmaker here is less useful than how many people are being packed into each row. Without a standard width measurement, seatmakers can, to use a real-world example, say they’ve packed an 18”-wide seat onto a 737, but only because the armrest is risibly narrow, or the shoulder space is right up against a curved sidewall.

Let’s look more deeply at what the layouts mean in practice, with both widebody and narrowbody examples from aircraft currently in production.

Type A relatively wide layouts would be, for example, on a ten-abreast Airbus A380, nine-abreast Boeing 777 or Airbus A350, eight-abreast Boeing 787, seven-abreast Boeing 767, or a five-abreast Bombardier CSeries. These are well-above average seats that most knowledgeable passengers aim for when in economy.

Type B’s relatively comfortable layouts look like an eight-abreast A330/A340 cabin, or six-across an A320 family aircraft (on an airline that hasn’t chosen the fast-boarding wider aisle option like Northwest and easyJet did). These are the second-best option.

Type C layouts are uncomfortably narrow, like a ten-abreast Boeing 777 or nine-abreast 787, or (to a slightly lesser extent) the Boeing 737 six-abreast cross-section. These are aircraft that people who are savvy about #PaxEx and who care about economy seat size steer away from wherever possible.

Besides the whole new plane thing, this is an aircraft I'd like to avoid if possible unless in F or MCE — iflyplaces (@iflyplaces) August 13, 2017

Type D ultra-narrow layouts, meanwhile, are a ten-abreast A350, nine-abreast A330/A340, or eight-abreast 767. These are, so far, usually charter, ultra-low-cost, leisure-only layouts, like Air Caraïbes, AirAsia X, Air Transat, Cebu Pacific, Philippine Airlines’ old A330-300, and so on. They’re definitely only acceptable if paying bottom dollar for a flight.

As an aside, I could also be persuaded that there may also be a Type C+ seat, to take into account the ten-abreast Boeing 747 that was long the international economy standard, but it’s important to note that the 747 was originally envisaged as a very comfortable nine-abreast aircraft (which would be perhaps a Type A+) and numerous airlines selected layouts like 3-4-2 for comfort, before settling on the tighter configuration.

As for the eleven-abreast Airbus A380 proposal, it suffers from the two key problems of foot space by the window and a centre section of five seats, and if created would likely end up as a Type D seat for those reasons.

The bottom line, though is that Airbus doesn’t offer any Type C layouts, steering airlines to really bite the bullet and consciously choose a really uncomfortable Type D configuration or stick with either the very good Type A or pretty good Type B options. I’ll call these A-D or B-D choices.

Boeing, however, offers the option of a Type C layouts on all its current widebody fuselages, which has prompted airlines to select them over the type A configurations. These are A-C choices.

It’s notable that the 767, Boeing’s last A-D choice (since a few airlines do operate 2-4-2 cabins on the 767), remains one of the most popular aircraft among passengers.

Over the short and medium term, Boeing is already at work defining the middle-of-market 797, which has the opportunity hopefully (from a passenger experience standpoint) to be an A-D choice, or at least B-D. Airbus, too, will almost certainly be designing the aircraft that will span the space between its A320neo family replacement narrowbody and the A350.

Both companies have choices to make. In an increasingly mobile, social and vocal world, passengers will be watching.

Crew immersed the bag in a container of water to extinguish the fire.

A lithium battery pack and two cell phones were discovered inside the bag.

On Sunday, at least one lithium battery caught fire on board a SriLankan Airlines flight from Kochi, India to Colombo, Sri Lanka.

""Alert cabin crew members aboard SriLankan Airlines’ flight UL 166 managed to avert a major incident that is believed to have been caused by the ignition of a lithium battery pack or mobile phones in a passenger’s hand luggage,"" SriLankan Airlines said in a statement.

According to the airline, flight attendants at the rear of the Airbus A330-200 noticed smoke emitting from a bag stored in an overhead bin.

After spraying down the bag with a fire extinguisher, the crew removed the bag from the bin. However, the bag began to emit smoke at an even higher rate, at which point, the crew kicked enacted their lithium fire procedures and immersed the bag in water.

Once the fire had been extinguished, flight attendants discovered a lithium battery pack along with two cellular phones inside the bag.

Fortunately, neither the crew nor the 202 passengers on board the flight were injured and the jet was able to land safely at its destination where it was met by ""dangerous goods experts"" and fire officials.

The airline, as well as Sri Lankan authorities, have launched an investigation into the incident.

In May, a JetBlue Airbus A321 traveling from New York to San Francisco was forced to make an emergency landing in Michigan after another lithium battery pack caught fire in an overhead bin. Again, the aircraft was able to land safely after cabin crew extinguished the fire in flight. No injuries were reported among the 158 passengers and crew on board the flight.

Perlan Project's Glider Sets New World Altitude Record in Argentina Testing (Video) - WIRED,"Thu, 03 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS90aGUtcG93ZXJsZXNzLXBsYW5lLXJpZGluZy10aGUtd2luZC10by1hLW5ldy1hbHRpdHVkZS1yZWNvcmQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Flying well into the stratosphere to set a record for the highest manned flight takes guts. Doing it in a glider takes skilled engineers, pilots, and atmospheric scientists, elusive weather conditions, a heap of luck, and yes, guts. After 20-odd years of hard work, the team behind the Perlan Project thinks it finally has everything in place to make it happen. And it just set another record on the way to making it happen.

NASA test pilot Einar Enevoldson first dreamed of soaring 85,000 feet above Earth in 1992. He figured he could ride ""stratospheric mountain waves""—wind currents that shoot straight up after hitting a mountain range—to fly higher than even the mighty Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance plane.

Enevoldson and Steve Fossett, who set a slew of aviation and sailing records before his disappearance and death in 2007, soared at 50,720 feet in 2006 with the first iteration of the Perlan glider. That set a record for a manned glider, but Enevoldson hoped to go higher still. He and his team of two dozen volunteers, funded by Airbus, is back with a bigger, better glider, and hopes to beat the Blackbird's record of 85,069 feet.

On September 3, pilots Jim Payne and Morgan Sandercock flew the glider to 52,172, a new world record for gliders.1 They did so high above Argentina's Patagonia region, where the peaks of the Andes and hurricane strength winds provide optimal conditions to beat their benchmark of 51,000 feet. “We can get to 40 or 50,000 feet in other parts of the world, but we can’t get to the edge of space, except for here and maybe over Scandinavia,” says project CEO Ed Warnock.

It may sound almost impossible to achieve such heights without propulsion, but apart from a tow off the ground, Perlan II manages it. The white glider, which weighs just 1,100 pounds when empty, uses an albatross-like wingspan of 84 feet to maintain lift. It requires a fair amount of skill to pull this off, though—gliders descend at about 100 feet a minute if they don't have sufficient lift to maintain flight, so the pilot must find rising columns of air. “It’s not uncommon in good mountain wave areas for air to rise 2,000 to 3,000 feet a minute, so at low altitudes you can rise pretty fast,” says chief pilot Jim Payne.

The two-seat cockpit is pressurized, freeing the pilots from bulky, cumbersome suits. You don't find much oxygen at that altitude, so the pilots breath from bottles with rebreathers. The video above provides a glimpse of what it's like soaring at that altitude.

Naturally, flying that high comes with risks. Atmospheric pressure is just 2 percent that of sea level, so if a seal breaks or the cabin loses pressure, the pilots will be exposed to near-vacuum conditions. And at extreme altitudes, atmospheric waves can break like white water, tossing the lightweight glider around violently. It does have a parachute at the back for emergencies.

Ed Warnock, CEO of the project, admits that balloons and other aircraft have reached greater altitudes, but argues that airplanes flying at such heights use engines and afterburners to achieve a parabolic flight pattern. “We’re going to be able to fly level and maintain our altitude at 90,000 feet,” he says. Pretty impressive for an aircraft that can't make its own power.

As for why, well, science, for one. You can obtain cleaner air samples at altitude in a plane that isn’t pumping out exhaust, and that's good for climate research. But mostly, the Perlan team wants to do it out of a love of aviation, science, and adventure. In other words, because it can.

"Metro's new bird takes flight, 'last option' for search and rescue - Las Vegas Sun","Thu, 17 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbGFzdmVnYXNzdW4uY29tL25ld3MvMjAxNy9hdWcvMTcvbWV0cm9zLW5ldy1iaXJkLXRha2VzLWZsaWdodC1sYXN0LW9wdGlvbi1mb3Itc2VhcmMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Metro’s new bird takes flight, ‘last option’ for search and rescue

Up in the sky, look: It’s not a bird. It’s not a plane. But Metro Police’s latest airborne toy does share some of Superman’s powerful qualities.

The new $9.6 million Airbus H145 Helicopter — the first of its kind in Metro Search and Rescue’s five-helicopter fleet — has two engines, each with the super strength of more than 1,000 horsepower.

“It is a significant advancement to our current capabilities,” said Officer Steve Morris Jr., chief pilot of Metro’s Air Support Section. “This is a very capable helicopter, and it fills some big shoes.”

Metro exhibited the new bird Wednesday at the North Las Vegas Airport, which serves as Metro’s base for an average of 120 annual search-and-rescue flights. Almost all of those flights assist stranded or injured hikers in Red Rock Canyon and Mount Charleston, Morris said.

The new helicopter features a Fenestron, a protected tail rotor for a quieter flight. It also helps ensure the safety of those walking near the chopper because it shields the tail blades, unlike traditional helicopter models, Morris said.

The tail number bears the initials of Metro Officer David Vanbuskirk, who died during a July 2013 rescue mission in Mount Charleston when he became detached from a hoist cable line while rescuing a stranded hiker and fell to his death.

Officer Bryan Woolard, who served as Morris’ co-pilot during Wednesday’s demonstration, co-piloted the flight during which Vanbuskirk lost his life.

“It was important for us to memorialize him, so his memory will remain with us for the life of the helicopter,” Woolard said.

Three of the other four search-and-rescue helicopters were manufactured in the 1970s and have been in use for more than 30 years. The fourth was purchased in 2015. Morris hopes the new chopper will also serve the force for three decades.

Morris said the H145 is more precise than the rest of the fleet and can fit into tighter spots in uneven canyon and forest landscapes. It’s a “last option” for authorities, who prefer the less expensive route of locating and rescuing hikers using ground methods. But ground rescue is only feasible for about 50 of the average 170 annual operations, he said, leaving the rest to the helicopters.

Unlike Superman, the H145 won’t be saving many people in the city. Although it’s labeled for “multipurpose use,” including patrol coverage to help officers on the ground catch suspects of violent crimes, the new chopper spends too much fuel for such missions, Morris said.

“Many times the helicopter is the first police resource to arrive on a search-and-rescue scene before any ground units do,” he said. “We provide that insight and give that necessary information to the other units.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999181032180786}",neutral,0.9999181032180786,0

He did not mention the origin of the A380s, but it is not difficult to guess that they are ex-Singapore Airlines aircraft. We reported earlier in this website and in our forum that Singapore Air would withdraw the first A380 registered 9V-SKA from service on June 11, with the lease expiring on 12 October. Next year the leasing contract of four more A380 aircraft will expire as well.

Mirpuri also said to aeroTELEGRAPH that the two A380s would be reconfigured in a two-class cabin configuration, Business and Economy.

Those A380s will join the all-Airbus fleet of Hi Fly which comprises one A321 (leased to the Belgian Air Force), three A330s and nine A340s, with two more A330-200s on order.

Iran Offers Huge Market for Narrow-Body Jets - Financial Tribune,"Sat, 19 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jaWFsdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvZWNvbm9teS1idXNpbmVzcy1hbmQtbWFya2V0cy83MDY3NS9pcmFuLW9mZmVycy1odWdlLW1hcmtldC1mb3ItbmFycm93LWJvZHktamV0c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Iranian airlines are placing massive orders for short- to medium-haul passenger planes, indicating Iran is a huge market for narrow-body jets.

So far, Boeing and Airbus have been the frontrunners, taking advantage of the opened up aviation market after the removal of sanctions early 2016, when a deal clinched months earlier between Tehran and world powers to settle a longstanding dispute over Iran’s nuclear program went into effect.

There are firm orders. Iran Air has ordered 46 jets from Airbus A320 family and 50 of Boeing 737Max. Iran Aseman Airlines has purchased 30 B737Max jets, with the option of adding 30 more.

Memoranda of understanding have also been signed—some confirmed by plane manufacturers and others announced only by the airlines inside Iran.

Qeshm Air and Kish Airlines say each have signed agreements to purchase 10 B737Max jets. Iran Air Tours has signed an MoU for 45 Airbus A320neos and Zagros Airlines has a similar deal with Airbus for 20 planes of the same type.

Iran Air has also ordered 20 ATR turboprop aircraft, with the option of adding 20 more.

The government has estimated that Iran needs 400-500 planes within the next 10 years, but the orders show single-aisle jets are in higher demand.

This must be the reason why manufacturers of regional jets have been travelling more frequently to Iran. Brazil’s Embraer, Canada’s Bombardier and Russia’s Sukhoi have all been in talks with airlines inside Iran.

Iran’s Qeshm Free Zone is in talks with the Montreal-based multinational aerospace and transportation company Bombardier Inc. to buy 10 planes. The free zone is planning to launch a new airline called Fly Qeshm.

Emrbaer has also been eying Iran. A presidential aide in Brazil was quoted by Reuters as saying in October last year that Iran is interested in buying 50 airliners from the Brazilian planemaker.

> Frequency & Profitability

“We believe the E-Jets will work very well in the Iranian market and provide a full solution for airlines looking for profitable lift up to 150 seats in a world where frequency and profitability are increasingly intertwined,” Embraer told Financial Tribune via email.

Both Embraer and Sukhoi have organized events in Tehran where they showcased their products for Iranian carriers that are in dire need of modern fuel-efficient regional planes to cover domestic routes across the vast country.

“Iran has one of the biggest land masses across the Middle East so it stands to reason that narrow-body airplanes like the B737 and A320 will feature most from a sales campaign aspect,” Saj Ahmad, chief analyst at Dubai-based StrategicAero Research, told Financial Tribune.

“Intra-Iran domestic scene is one that all airlines want to play in for market share and they can only do that with new and fuel-efficient airplanes.”

He believes the reliability and robustness of the A320/A320neo and 737/737MAX families mean Airbus and Boeing will always end up winning a bigger slice of the pie compared to smaller players like Embraer or Bombardier.

That is “primarily because the economies of scale that their [Airbus and Boeing] airplanes bring, meaning that there is less of a business case to buy sub 150-seat airplanes,” he said, excluding SSJ100, whose lower capacity and size make flights more economical for such city pairs like Tehran-Isfahan or Shiraz-Yazd.

“On routes such as that, frequency is king, not capacity, that’s why smaller jets like the SSJ-100 would be perfect and would be far easier to fill, than say a 189-seat 737MAX8 or a 180-seat A320neo,” Ahmad said.

“The real challenge on the widebody front, where Iran Air has orders for A330s, A350s, 777-300ERs and 777-9s, is that the airline needs to launch new international gateways and expand organically.”

While the nuclear deal gives Iran a great opportunity to establish new trade links, he believes, there has been a very slow pace of development in terms of air links to new city pairs.

Ahmad said this has been choked by financial aspects in that Iran Air has struggled to get financing for its new airplanes–and without those jets, it can’t launch new routes.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999130964279175}",neutral,0.9999130964279175,0
Qantas launches Project Sunrise and challenges Boeing and Airbus - Aviation24.be,"Fri, 25 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF2aWF0aW9uMjQuYmUvYWlybGluZXMvcWFudGFzL3FhbnRhcy1jaGFsbGVuZ2VzLWJvZWluZy1haXJidXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Qantas has launched its Project Sunrise and challenges both Boeing and Airbus to develop an aircraft that is able to connect the East Coast of Australia with London, New York, Paris and Rio.

Qantas has always looked to the horizon. It has always pushed boundaries and flown further to connect Australians to each other and Australians to the world.

The original kangaroo route from Australian to London took 4 days and stopped seven times. Forty years later, this was reduced to just 20 hours and one stop. As from March 2018, with the introduction of the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner into the fleet and the opening of the airline’s new non-stop Perth-London flight, it will be reduced even further to just 17 hours in a single hop.

Along the way, the airline has made the journey more comfortable. From inventing business class in 1979 to working with scientists to reduce jetlag in 2017.

Today, Qantas is setting its sight on the next frontier: non-stop flights from the East Coast of Australia to London, New York, Paris and Rio de Janeiro, by 2022.

From To Distance Sydney (SYD) London (LHR) 9.188 nm Sydney (SYD) New York (JFK) 8.647 nm Sydney (SYD) Paris (CDG) 9.148 nm Sydney (SYD) Rio de Janeiro (GRU) 7.229 nm

The airline has challenged the world’s two biggest airline manufacturers Boeing and Airbus, to extend the range of their next generation aircraft to put these direct flights within reach. This would save travellers up to four hours of travel time in the process.

The project was given the name ‘Project Sunrise’, named after the legendary double sunrise flights Qantas flew during the Second World War across the Indian Ocean. These flights lasted long enough to see two sunrises.

Airbus x Pagani: new Infinito jet to have futuristic ‘Sky Ceiling’ - Globetrender,"Wed, 09 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vZ2xvYmV0cmVuZGVyLmNvbS8yMDE3LzA4LzA5L2FpcmJ1cy1wYWdhbmktaW5maW5pdG8tc2t5LWNlaWxpbmcv0gFLaHR0cHM6Ly9nbG9iZXRyZW5kZXIuY29tLzIwMTcvMDgvMDkvYWlyYnVzLXBhZ2FuaS1pbmZpbml0by1za3ktY2VpbGluZy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A collaboration between aircraft manufacturer Airbus and Italian supercar designer Pagani has given birth to the futuristic new Infinito cabin. Ready to be installed on ACJ319neo private jets, the highlight will be the innovative “Sky Ceiling” to create a feeling of “airiness and space”.

Although it looks as if the roof of the jet slides back to reveal the clouds, or a glass ceiling has been installed for unimpeded views of the sky, neither of these scenarios is the case. In reality, the ceiling is a long screen that displays what’s above in real-time by strategically placed cameras on the exterior of the plane. (It can also be used to broadcast other media.) Horacio Pagani, founder and chief designer of Pagani Automobili SpA, says: “Art and science can walk together hand in hand: this is the Pagani philosophy. The combination of state-of-the-art composite materials never used before in an aircraft, such as CarboTitanium, with the typical design language of Pagani Automobili, has always represented our signature. Applying our Reinassance touch into the wider spaces of Airbus corporate jet cabins is the beginning of an exciting new venture for us.”

With space for just eight (very rich) customers on board, the Infinito cabin also has a dining room and cinema, and a conference room and lounge, separated by a wall that can turn from opaque to transparent at the touch of a button.

Interiors are inspired by Pagani hypercars, with soft leather upholstery, carbon-fibre furniture, wooden flooring, sculpted metal, mirroring and LED mood lighting.

Airbus Corporate Jets managing director Benoit Defforge says: “In bringing together the best of the supercar and business jet worlds, we enable an elegant and seamless link for customers of both, while bringing a fresh approach to cabin design and satisfying very demanding standards.”

Although it will be some years before regular flyers have the chance of experiencing a Sky Ceiling on commercial planes, it’s exciting to see what the technology is capable of. Airbus has come up with an ambitious concept aircraft with a transparent membrane (among many other dazzling innovations), so sitting back in your seat with a view of the sky is something that could be on the horizon.

The Ruler of Dubai Takes a Trip to the Airbus Plant in Hamburg to Personally Inspect the Next Emirates A380 - paddleyourownkanoo.com,"Tue, 15 Aug 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wYWRkbGV5b3Vyb3dua2Fub28uY29tLzIwMTcvMDgvMTUvcnVsZXItZHViYWktdGFrZXMtdHJpcC1haXJidXMtcGxhbnQtaGFtYnVyZy1wZXJzb25hbGx5LWluc3BlY3QtbmV4dC1lbWlyYXRlcy1hMzgwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, made a personal visit to the Airbus manufacturing facility in Hamburg, Germany yesterday. Arriving in a top of the range Mercedes G-Wagon the sheikh was taken on a tour of the factory where Airbus has its final assembly line for A320 aircraft and the A380 superjumbo.

Sheikh Maktoum started off by observing the production of parts for A320 aircraft before moving on to an A380 destined for the Dubai-based airline, Emirates. The aircraft was in its final stages of being fitted out, complete with the refreshed, new look bar and lounge.

Emirates has a total of 142 A380’s on order with Airbus and is the largest operator of the model – responsible for 40% of all the A380’s operated in the world. In July, Emirates took delivery of its 96th A380, marking nine years since the first one was delivered to the airline.

According to WAM, the official UAE press agency, Emirates is expected to receive its 100th A380 in November with the backlog of orders set to be complete by 2025. So far, Emirates hasn’t announced whether it will order any more of the superjumbo’s but the very future of the A380 project rests on Emirates’ continuing support of the model.

In recent months, Airbus has been trying to woo potential customers of the A380 with a series of modifications to the aircraft. This includes ‘space optimizers’ to fit even more passenger seats within the current shell (around 80 in total) and the so called ‘A380plus’ – The Plus would feature new winglets to help reduce fuel burn by 4% and a greater range capability than the existing model.

However, Airbus has so far refused to consider an idea that Tim Clark, the president of Emirates has said his airline wants – the A380neo. Essentially, a redesign of the current aircraft with new, more fuel efficient engines. But such a project would add a significant amount of money to the already huge R&D costs of the A380.

With current orders, Airbus is currently producing about 14 A380’s per year – although, if Airbus doesn’t get a big new order soon, production is set to slow to a trickle. The manufacturing process takes nearly 12 months from start to finish and costs about $400 million USD.

In contrast with the boss of Qatar Airways (who hasn’t minced his words about the problems his airline has faced with its A350 aircraft), Sheikh Maktoum confirmed he was far happier with the performance of Airbus. During the tour, he “lauded the commitment” of Airbus and Emirates in providing “all means of comfort, luxury and safety for all passengers who prefer this unique type of plane.”

Several weeks ago the Airbus Hamburg plant had even more royal visitors when Prince William the Duke of Cambridge Catherine the Duchess of Cambridge paid a trip to the facility. For their visit, the Royal guests visited the vocational training facilities and learned about the German apprentice system.

As a helicopter pilot himself, Prince William also viewed the H135 and H145 Airbus helicopters.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999935626983643}",neutral,0.9999935626983643,0

CHC Helicopter will today take delivery of its first H175 for use in offshore oil and gas operations. The aircraft has been delivered in full offshore passenger transport configuration, allowing CHC to begin training and adjustment from the operator’s base at Aberdeen, ahead of the operational launch in August 2017.

Based at CHC Helicopter’s site in Aberdeen, Scotland, the H175 has been configured to carry 16 passengers in offshore oil and gas configuration and will benefit from a nose-to-tail HCare services contract. The HCare contract will help maximise cost efficiencies through coverage for all spare parts and repairable items supplied from Airbus Helicopters’ North Sea Fleet Centre, also in Aberdeen.

Dave Balevic, Senior Vice President, Engineering and Operations at CHC Helicopter, said,

The H175 allows us to continue to refine our global fleet to meet the unique needs of our customers while offering the latest aircraft technology and capabilities.

Today, a global fleet of 15 H175 have flown more than 12,000 hours, with 13 flying oil and gas missions – the majority of these in the North Sea with one operating in the Gulf of Mexico. The H175 has a maximum take-off weight (MTOW) of nearly 8 tonnes and is designed to provide unmatched efficiency across a range of missions, including utility, VIP transport, oil and gas and search and rescue. Equipped with Helionix, Airbus Helicopters’ integrated suite of advanced avionics and 4-axis autopilot, the H175 offers enhanced situational awareness and improved operational safety by helping to reduce pilot workload and increasing mission flexibility.

Ben Bridge, EVP Global Business at Airbus Helicopters said,

CHC will benefit from the enhanced flexibility the H175 offers, helping to smoothly and efficiently transport up to 16 passengers to North Sea offshore installations.” He added, “With full glass cockpit, automated systems, spacious cabin and large windows, the H175 represents a major achievement for AH, helping to raise the bar in terms of operational efficiency, safety and comfort in offshore operations.

With virtually little or no vibration at cruise speeds of 150 knots and maximum speeds of 165 knots, the H175, already in operation with NHV, Pegaso, Babcock and Monacair and is playing a key role supporting the offshore oil and gas industry through the efficiencies that this flexible aircraft brings into service.
