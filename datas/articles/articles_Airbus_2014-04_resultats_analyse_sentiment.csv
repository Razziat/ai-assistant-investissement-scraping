5 Features of Airbus’ New A350 That Will Make the Passenger Experience Better - Skift Travel News,"Tue, 08 Apr 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMTQvMDQvMDgvNS1mZWF0dXJlcy1vZi1haXJidXMtbmV3LWEzNTAtdGhhdC13aWxsLWltcHJvdmUtdGhlLXBhc3Nlbmdlci1leHBlcmllbmNlL9IBamh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMTQvMDQvMDgvNS1mZWF0dXJlcy1vZi1haXJidXMtbmV3LWEzNTAtdGhhdC13aWxsLWltcHJvdmUtdGhlLXBhc3Nlbmdlci1leHBlcmllbmNlL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"'Wide body' holds the promise of more room. Let's hope the airlines don't screw it up.

We joined key members of the world’s press on a tour of Airbus’ brand new A350XWB aircraft, during which were treated to tantalizing hints of what we can expect onboard when the aircraft graces the skies.

Here’s the countdown of our top five favorite A350WXB features, ranked by how likely they are to contribute to a pleasant flight soon.

5. Large windows with “auto-mechanical” shades

Larger windows are a nice feature of the new A350XWB, and Airbus is proud to say that they provide one window per seat. The difference between Airbus’ “auto-mechanical window shades” and the electronic shades on “the other” manufacturer’s modern aircraft is that Airbus’ are less advanced.

And that’s good.

Beautiful as the electronic dimming window concept is, there have been some unfortunate reliability issues. Airbus’ “auto mechanical” shades consist of two accordion blinds, one sheer and another dark, which descend and retract at the push of a button. Don’t knock it. It works. Well, so long as the electrified buttons don’t fail. And the blinds don’t get stuck.

Just in case, Airbus will supply conventional blinds as an option for airlines too.

4. Roomier Seats

If this were a guarantee, it would make number one on our list. The truth, however, is not as nice as the marketing pitch.

Airbus believes that an 18-inch standard should be, well, standard. They’ve planned the A350XWB interior to accommodate 9-abreast 18-inch seats in economy, by sets of three. But that’s just planning. Airlines will pick the configurations which best suit their business strategy. Airbus concedes that some airlines will prefer a 10-abreast 17-inch seat configuration.

3. Fourth-generation in-flight entertainment quipment

Panasonic screens are featured on all seats throughout the cabin. Airbus believes that this new fourth-generation IFE will revolutionize inflight-entertainment, and they are most likely right.

The system is highly responsive, with capacity to accommodate HD content, either from passengers’ own devices (connected via USB) or via the in-flight entertainment — or even through live-streamed TV service, using their Ku-band connection.

That should be number one, but it can’t be. The content and service are presently unavailable to fully capitalize on the potential of this equipment.

2. No IFE box under the seats

Airbus said good-riddance to IFE boxes on the A350XWB, and installed advanced fiber optic wiring for that state-of-the-art, fourth-gen IFE equipment. Forget finding those wires too. They’re practically invisible, cleverly hidden on this aircraft.

1. Room Room Room

Maybe it won’t be on your seat (blame the airline for that) but the aircraft was designed for ample space. The unique upright side panels maximize the space for those who chose window over aisle. The very high ceiling makes the cabin feel cavernous.

That space is enhanced by the best of all features, when it comes to passenger experience enhancement: enormous overhead bins. They are completely out of the way, but hold enough bags for each passenger to carry a full-sized bag onboard.

Though lost-luggage is on a downturn, most passengers still prefer to carry-on. This feature is ready to go, and standard. To us, that guaranteed availability makes it the best of all possible features.

Oh, and it comes in rainbow colors; with special LED mood-lighting throughout, and uses this light feature to help you regulate your body clock and avoid jet-lag, which is just “plane” groovy.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999628067016602}",neutral,0.9999628067016602,0
Airbus to cram 11-seat rows into A380 - CNN,"Tue, 01 Apr 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLWEzODAtZXh0cmEtc2VhdHMvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Story highlights Airbus says it will unveil new economy class seating configuration that puts 11 seats in a row of its A380 superjumbo Extra seats will be added by partially raising the floor of the cabin to maximize fuselage width Analyst says extra seats show economic realities have caught up with luxury plans for the huge aircraft

CNN —

It’s already capable of carrying more passengers than any other commercial aircraft, but the Airbus A380 could be about to squeeze in a few extra.

In a move that adds a dose of economic reality to airline dreams of luxuriously pimped superjumbos, the plane’s manufacturer says that next week it will unveil a new 11-seat-row economy-class configuration.

By raising the three seats next to each window a few inches to take advantage of extra fuselage space, Airbus says it will create enough room to accommodate five people in the middle of the plane.

While the prospect of spending a long haul flight stuck in the middle seat might be unappealing for passengers, Airbus says it makes sense for airline revenues.

Experts say sales of the A380 have been disappointing since it was launched in 2007. MN Chan/Getty Images

“Several customers are saying they are interested in looking at ways of making the aircraft more productive,” Airbus spokesman Justin Dubon tells CNN.

Murdo Morrison, editor of Flightglobal magazine, says the new configuration indicates that financial realities are catching up with airlines, which once promised to fill their A380s with casinos and double beds.

He says sales of the European manufacturer’s flagship have been disappointing since the plane was launched in October 2007.

“With the price of fuel going up so much, the focus for airlines is economizing and trying to get as many passengers as possible into an aircraft,” he tells CNN.

Raised capacity

Dubon says the extra seats, which won’t compromise on the existing 18-inch width of current chairs, would raise economy-class capacity by 7%.

This would mean 30 more seats in a standard cabin layout, but even when full would put the A380 well short of its maximum load capacity.

“The middle seats will be the last ones filled,” he says, adding that the center seats could prove popular with families.

Airbus declined to reveal which airlines were pushing for increased capacity, but says 11-seat mockups will go on display at the Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg, Germany, from April 8-10.

Morrison says that while few passengers will rush to claim the center seats, there will be no significant increase in discomfort.

“The drawback of any five-seat block is, if you are in the middle, you’ve always got two people to climb over, but you’ve already got that if you’re in the window seat of a block of three,” he says.

“Ultimately it is the airline’s decision – they have to get the balance between adding seat capacity and what the passengers will put up with.

“If you pack in too many it becomes claustrophobic and that could have a detrimental affect on the airline.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.969285786151886}",neutral,0.969285786151886,0
How Airbus Preps Jets to Handle the Body Heat From 300 Passengers - WIRED,"Wed, 09 Apr 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS8yMDE0LzA0L2FpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLXh3Yi1zZWF0LXRlc3Rpbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"How do you test the effects of hundreds of passengers toiling away in their seats on a 12-hour flight? For Airbus, you rig up hundreds of feet of tubes and fill them with heated water to mimic the human body.

The A350 XWB is Airbus’ answer to the Boeing 787, complete with carbon fiber fuselage and wings--a first for a passenger jet. And to avoid the issues that have plagued the Dreamliner, Airbus is in the process of testing four prototype A380 “eXtra-wide” planes. And part of that testing involves the just-revealed interior.

The humanoid pipes sitting in the seats are filled with water that’s adjusted to simulate the body temperature of a cabin full of people. Airbus heats them with between 70 watts to 160 watts of power, with 90 watts being used to represent the average passenger’s body heat. If the cabin’s climate system and seat materials hold up after a simulated overseas trip, the interior is ready to go.

For the A350 XWB, Airbus clearly added some comfort features in its latest flagship. In coach, each seat is 18 inches wide, even with a nine-abreast layout, and made by top-tier supplier Recaro, the same company that builds seats for racers and hip-hugging passenger cars.

For all the computer monitors and sensors, there’s not much guarantee that you’ll be a happier passenger. Airbus, like all airplane manufacturers, leaves the seat layout to the discretion of the airlines. So Qatar Airways--the A350 XWB’s launch partner--can divvy up the 18.4 foot-wide cabin as it sees fit. Hopefully, Airbus’s generous berth will be left intact when it reaches production.

When the final versions are completed, the A350 XWB will come in three versions, each holding between 276 and 369 seats. Airbus currently has 812 orders for the new plane, with Qatar Airways planning to send the A350 XWB on its maiden flight later this year.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999891519546509}",neutral,0.9999891519546509,0

10-abreast A350 XWB clearly part of Airbus pitch - Runway Girl Network,"Tue, 08 Apr 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTQvMDQvMTAtYWJyZWFzdC1hMzUwLXh3Yi1jbGVhcmx5LXBhcnQtb2YtYWlyYnVzLXBpdGNoL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It’s important to have a strong vision and pride in the products one produces. For Christopher Emerson, Airbus’s SVP marketing, the feelings run deeper than that. Emerson presented the new A350 Customer Design Center to the media yesterday as part of an event which also introduced the first passenger-configured A350 airframe to the public. And the theme of the presentation was quite clear: The A350 is not just a plane for today; it is a plane for many years to come. It is “future proof.”

This means that the cabin layout of the A350 is based on the concept of “simplicity by design” where efficiency of space on board the aircraft is a key factor. When it comes to fitting that space out with seats Airbus has a number of layout options available, including a 10-abreast, high-density option.

The trend to higher density seating in economy class is not a secret and, despite the airframer’s call for an 18-in standard seat width, Airbus is very much aware that the 221-inch cross-section of the A350 leaves open the possibility of a 3-4-3 arrangement, though airlines have so far ordered the A350 with 3-3-3 18-inch wide seats.

“This is allowing us to have a full breadth of product offering. Airlines which want to have a high-efficiency [layout] driving the lowest seat mile cost can have 10-abreast in the economy class cabin. We have our standard 9-abreast … which is meeting the standard that we believe is required for the continued growth in the industry, 18 inches between armrests,” says Emerson.

Emerson describes the overall cabin in grand terms, focusing on the space available for the airlines to give to customers.

“We’re talking about a 221 inch cross-section that essentially is the palette the airlines will have…. The sidewalls are almost vertical. That’s very important because as we want to optimize the space that is your personal space and we don’t want to encroach on your space,” he says.

Emerson also talked about the next set of travel decision makers.

“We have engaged a few studies … just to understand the passenger of the future. [Gen Y] may not be the middle of the market segment today but in 10 years they will be. What is it that they are expecting? How is it that they want to spend the time? And are we future proofed? …

“We think about air quality, we think about lighting, we think about the seats. And here we’re pretty happy with the XWB, the 18-inch seats, the cabin ambiance inside. I think here it is future proof for us: Superior seat, superior comfort, the whole environment is there.”

And sitting on the plane it is easy to see why Emerson feels that way. The layout on display inside this test aircraft, MSN 002, is rather comfortable. Admittedly our time on board was very, very brief. I probably spent a total of only 2-3 minutes in the seats themselves. And the pitch in the economy section is more generous than what most airlines offer which also skews the experience. Still, the overall feel was quite pleasant.

The economy class cabin has the Recaro 3620 seats, one of four options available to customers, in a 3-3-3 layout.

The business class cabin has the Sogerma Solstys staggered flat-bed seats in a 1-2-1 layout.

While the focus of the unveiling yesterday was mostly on the seating, there was also quite a bit of discussion about the IFE and how it relates to the passenger experience today and the future options for the aircraft. The IFE screens are bigger than comparable offerings on prior generation aircraft, but there are many other little things as well. The IFE cabling being better integrated into the mounting rails, for example, and fiber optics are being used rather than copper to increase the system bandwidth and decrease weight.

Connectivity is being built in to the aircraft from the initial design, with line-fit satellite-based systems available from the first customer delivery. And the control box for the IFE systems is no longer mounted to the underside of the seat, freeing up space for passengers. All of this should add up to a more comfortable experience for passengers.

For Airbus these changes to the IFE system are also part of the “future proof” concept they’ve applied to the A350.

“We’re really thinking about future-proofing [in-flight entertainment and connectivity] and for Airbus the A350 XWB is an enabler. We have the right cabin and it is future-proofed. … When we look inside the aircraft the backbone architecture of the flat-floor wiring, the fiber optics, the single cable strand into each of the seats, the fourth generation IFE that allows even 3-D content: this one we feel is future-proofed,” says Emerson.

The layout is comfortable, to be sure. But it is also clearly not a customer-delivery setup. Only once a full complement of passengers have loaded on board will we really know just how well the plans have executed. In the meantime, however, consider this cautious optimism. It looks pretty good so far.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.954642653465271}",neutral,0.954642653465271,0

Airbus invites partners to test mission payloads with Zephyr 8 ‘Pseudo-Satellite’ - Defense Update,"Fri, 25 Apr 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5zZS11cGRhdGUuY29tLzIwMTQwNDI1X2FpcmJ1cy1pbnZpdGVzLXBhcnRuZXJzLXRlc3QtbWlzc2lvbi1wYXlsb2Fkcy16ZXBoeXItOC1wc2V1ZG8tc2F0ZWxsaXRlLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Defence and Space has launched a High Altitude Pseudo Satellite (HAPS) program developing a commercial variant of the world record setting Zephyr 7 high altitude long endurance (HALE) solar-powered unmanned aerial vehicle. Zephyr 8 will develop the next generation platform, designed to operate at very high altitude, as a pseudo-satellite.

Airbus’ subsidiary Astrium has been working on HAPS since 2008 in cooperation with the group’s defence subsidiary Cassidian and Innovation Works. For several years the program was managed as a cross-divisional nursery project, integrated a team of space and aviation specialists. In 2013 Astrium, now part of Airbus Defence and Space acquired the Zephyr assets from QinetiQ, integrating the Zephyr staff into Airbus’ HAPS organization.

Astrium is now set to develop a High Altitude Pseudo-Satellite offering that will provide a valuable augmentation to its existing space based services for communications and remote sensing

Running exclusively on solar power and flying at high altitudes above the weather and above commercial air traffic, Zephyr 8 will bridge the gap between satellites and UAVs. Unlike reconnaissance satellites that monitor the earth surface from low-earth orbit, these HAPS will be able to persist over an area of interest providing satellite-like communications and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) services without interruption. Through these evaluations Airbus’ Zephyr team is ready to help customers design, build and operate the mission payloads, or provide the necessary interface to integrate those payloads in upcoming test flights.

In 2010 the Zephyr 7 successfully achieved several world records, including the longest flight duration without refuelling (14 days), that was ten times longer than any other aircraft achieved before. It also flew at very high altitude, as high as 70,740 ft. The Zephyr 7 went through final testing in 2013, clearing the way for the next generation Zephyr 8.

According to Jens Federhen, Airbus HAPS program manager the team is now focused on the follow-on Zephyr 8, that will be able to carry and test various mission payloads. “We are ready and looking forward to demonstrating its unique capabilities to customers, in flight” Federhen said.

“Zephyr 7 was years ahead of any other HAPS system.” Zephyr Technical Director Chris Kelleher said, “We spent the last year analysing and designing exactly what we need to improve it”. Kelleher said Airbus has received permissions to fly Zephyr in test ranges in Australia, the USA and Europe.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999895453453064}",neutral,0.999895453453064,0

Airbus Helicopters signs six deals for aircraft during the FIDAE 2014 show in Chile.

Airbus Helicopters signed six helicopter deals at the FIDAE show held in Santiago, Chile worth a total of $54 million.

The Airbus Helicopters Cono Sur subsidiary revealed transactions at the show for its AS350, EC145 and EC155 rotorcraft.

Alexandre Ceccacci, CEO of Airbus Helicopters Cono Sur, said: “This success confirms our helicopter product line continues to meet the demanding operational requirements in this region of the world, which results from the capabilities of Airbus Helicopters’ current rotorcraft families and the constant evolution of our product line.”

The six deals that were announced at the show were, two EC145s for the Bolivian Air Force. The new EC145s will join two helicopters of this type received by the Bolivian Air Force in 2012, along with six AS332 C1e rotorcraft that were ordered last year by the military service for deliveries through 2016.

An AS350 B3 order from the Ministry of Security of Buenos Aires Province was announced, the fourth AS350 B3, operated along with five BO105s.

Airbus Helicopters signed a letter of intent with Peruvian operator Heliflight for two EC145s and one EC155 B1. These will be used in supporting the country’s energy industry. This customer currently has two AS350 B3s.

The company announced an order from a private Chilean client for an EC155 B1, an AS532 Ale Cougar to the Chilean Army, and the first enhanced EC130 T2 version received in this region of the world – delivered to a private customer.

Airbus A350 XWB and Customer Definition Centre Reveal - APEX Media,"Thu, 10 Apr 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vYXBleC5hZXJvL2FydGljbGVzL2FpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLXh3Yi1hbmQtY3VzdG9tZXItZGVmaW5pdGlvbi1jZW50cmUtcmV2ZWFsL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus A350 XWB and Customer Definition Centre Reveal Share

On April 7th, Airbus hosted a large group of media for the inauguration of the A350 XWB aircraft and Customer Definition Centre (CDC). The new aircraft was designed to address market needs within long haul developing routes with a new wide-body product, while the CDC is positioned to offer customers a streamlined process for cabin configuration and design. It’s much like a one-stop-shop and resource centre, allowing customers to “customize” the cabin experience on the brand new Airbus A350 XWB.

The CDC provides a myriad of tools under one roof, bridging the gap between early design research, product demonstrations, and real-size mock ups of cabin interiors. The customer experience begins with virtual cabin design on a large 3×6 meter screen, using software equipped with all available configuration options – it’s like a 3D sketch brought to life.

There is also an opportunity for customers to touch, feel and experience the A350 XWB comfort and environment long before the normal mock up stage, when it’s often too late to make substantial changes. An in-house design team provides a selection of 7 themes with specific color palettes and materials, which can be tailored to the existing branding of an airline client.

Standout features of the A350 XWB interiors include a vertical sidewall and larger windows with electromechanical shades that have both translucent and opaque options, which is made sweeter by the fact that every window seat is actually aligned with a window. The width of the aircraft can accommodate 9 abreast standard economy seats at 18″ arm to arm, topped with large overhead bins that allow every passenger to vertically stow one carry-on up to 45 kilos. The high degree of lighting adjustability is an impressive factor with the potential for up to 16.7 million colors. Highly considered crew areas that are efficiently integrated into the cabin profile have also allowed for more space on the passenger floor.

4th generation IFE consoles have been built in using fibre-optic cables and high-definition displays, with smartly integrated connections that avoid bulky electronics boxes under the seat, essentially “future-proofing” that technology for the foreseeable future.

The tour of hangar 211 on the Airbus compound was truly impressive – it never ceases to amaze when you walk into a building and stand beneath the expansive wings of a brand new aircraft.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9948000907897949}",neutral,0.9948000907897949,0
Airbus Helicopters launches Japan's first helicopter full flight simulator - Vertical Magazine,"Mon, 14 Apr 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1c2hlbGljb3B0ZXJzbGF1bmNoZXNqYXBhbnNmaXJzdGhlbGljb3B0ZXJmdWxsZmxpZ2h0c2ltdS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters Japan has inaugurated Japan’s first full flight simulator (FFS) for helicopters, with this high-fidelity training system now ready for service at its facilities located in the Kobe Airport vicinity.

The simulator is configured to represent Airbus Helicopters’ light twin-engine EC135 P2+ rotorcraft, and has received Level C certification from the Japan Civil Aviation Bureau (JCAB). With such airworthiness authority approval, training hours accumulated by pilots in the full flight simulator are now authorized to be logged as actual flight hours.

“Flight safety is our first priority at Airbus Helicopters,” said Stephane Ginoux, president of Airbus Helicopters Japan. “By introducing the first full flight simulator in Japan, we are contributing to enhancing the safety of helicopter operations. With this system now operational, the world standard in training is available for the country.”

This full flight simulator accurately represents the helicopter’s cockpit, instruments and systems, enabling aircrews to experience operations in all conditions – including emergency situations and flight in bad weather. With the simulator capable of reproducing various circumstances, pilots and maintenance technicians are able to refine their skills more efficiently and safely at lower costs, reducing training time on the actual aircraft.

Incorporating a standard EC135 flight data package developed by Airbus Helicopters, the simulator allows a full representation of the rotorcraft’s functionality, including its engines, autopilot, and all other systems by using real software and components. It is capable of simulating up to 195 malfunction situations, greatly enhancing the crews’ emergency handling abilities.

The EC135 is a twin-engine rotorcraft used worldwide for rescue, emergency medical transport, fire-fighting, coastal patrol, law enforcement, electronic news gathering and other missions. Also highly popular in Japan, there are about 77 EC135s operating in the country today.

Airbus Helicopters Japan’s training center, which is the first of its kind in the country, was officially established in 2012 at Kobe Airport. With qualified Japanese instructors, this facility provides such courses as emergency procedures training, recurrent training, type rating training and mission training through a wide variety of solutions. In 2013, 30 pilots and 185 maintenance technicians attended its training courses.

Airbus Helicopters has 25 training centers around the world, providing a complete range of services for civil and military pilots, maintenance technicians and other industry personnel. In order to improve flight safety, Airbus Helicopters continues to enhance the quantity, quality and cost efficiency of its training solutions offered to customers by placing full flight simulators closer to their operational bases. A total of 21 such simulators are operated around the globe by Airbus Helicopters.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9870032668113708}",neutral,0.9870032668113708,0
Q2 groundbreaking set for $13 million paint facility at Airbus A320 final assembly line in Mobile - AL.com,"Thu, 03 Apr 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDE0LzA0L2FpcmJ1c190b19icmVha19ncm91bmRfaW5fc2Vjby5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MOBILE, Alabama – Airbus Americas will break ground in the second quarter on a $13 million paint shop hangar for its A320 final assembly line under construction at Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley.

MAAS Aviation Aircraft Services, a division of the Expressair Group based in the Netherlands, will operate the facility, and Jesco Inc. will lead construction of the paint hangar.

The facility, slated for completion in mid-2015 and expected to employ 34 people, will be constructed within the 116-acre Airbus footprint at Mobile Aeroplex, and MAAS has options for expansion as Airbus’ production increases over the years.

“We’ve reached yet another major milestone in establishing the A320 assembly line in Mobile,” said Airbus Americas Chairman Allan McArtor in a prepared statement.

“Throughout a very tough competition, MAAS showed that it would build a world-class, state-of-the-art paint facility which will provide our customers with beautiful aircraft for their passengers. We look forward to working together for many years to come,” McArtor said.

The Dublin, Ireland-based MAAS is also currently responsible for some of the paint activities for Airbus’ final assembly lines in Hamburg, Germany.

MAAS Managing Director Darragh Hall said in a prepared statement the company is “delighted” by the “vote of confidence” Airbus is showing with this latest contract.

“Our relationship with Airbus is going from strength to strength, and the U.S. project provides further opportunity to reinforce this further. This is a big opportunity for our company and the green field nature of this project holds great appeal. We are also very excited to become a part of the Mobile community and to be one of the many leading companies building the aviation hub here,” Hall said.

Airbus is currently building its first A320 assembly line on U.S. soil at Mobile Aeroplex, expected to figure prominently in the company's ability to efficiently fill the mounting backlog for the popular single-aisle aircraft. The $600 million facility is slated to come online in 2015, deliver its first Mobile-assembled aircraft the following year and employ about 1,000 people when it reaches full annual production of 40 to 50 aircraft by 2018.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9990272521972656}",neutral,0.9990272521972656,0

Airbus Helicopters certifies EC145 T2 - Vertical Mag - Vertical Magazine,"Thu, 17 Apr 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1c2hlbGljb3B0ZXJzY2VydGlmaWVzZWMxNDV0Mi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The newest member of Airbus Helicopters’ proven EC145 rotorcraft family – the EC145 T2 – has been certified, clearing the way for customer deliveries beginning in the third quarter of this year.

Issued by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the certification covers the full range of capabilities, including single-pilot and instrument flight rules (IFR) and single engine operations (Cat.A/VTOL), along with night vision goggle capability.

“The EC145 T2 is setting new standards in its class,” said Airbus Helicopters CEO Guillaume Faury. “This new model features a design to meet and exceed the latest challenging requirements of our customers for mission capability. Our operators will benefit from an unrivalled operational advantage thanks to the perfect combination of airframe, equipment and performance. This comes along with the highest level of flight safety by our new Helionix avionics suite.”

Approximately 20 EC145 T2 currently are in series production, providing a solid basis for the initial deliveries and ramp-up in production rate. To date, Airbus Helicopters has received orders and options for more than 100 EC145 T2s, along with 15 of the military EC645 T2 variant for the German Army.

Enhancements incorporated in the T2 version of the 4-metric-ton category EC145 include new Arriel 2E engines and the company’s signature Fenestron shrouded tail rotor, along with upgraded main and new tail rotor gear boxes, and an advanced cockpit that uses Airbus Helicopter’s innovative Helionix digital avionics suite with 4-axis autopilot.

The new dual FADEC engines – combined with an upgraded main gear box – guarantee an unprecedented level of one-engine inoperative (OEI) performance, along with performance in hover, which are of utmost importance in emergency medical services (EMS) operations and for flight safety in general.

By applying Fenestron technology to the EC145 T2, Airbus Helicopters brings the tail rotor’s benefits in terms of improved flight and ground safety, enhanced anti-torque control efficiency, reduced power demand in forward flight, lower noise and vibration levels. For its use on the EC145 T2, the Fenestron has a new-design tail gearbox with lower maintenance costs, and incorporates a duplex tail rotor actuator and dual hydraulic circuits. This is installed in a new, damage-tolerant all- composite tail boom.

The EC145 T2’s designed-in modularity and its large unobstructed cabin with flat floor contribute to the helicopter’s flexibility for a full range of applications. The full range of optional equipment is being offered initially for utility, corporate and emergency medical services missions, to be followed soon by configurations for offshore and police duties. High levels of mission capability and flexibility are ensured with the Helionix avionics, which provides undisputed superiority of in-flight envelope protection, pilot assistance and situational awareness for unprecedented flight safety levels. Meeting the latest international avionics standards, the Helionix avionics suite incorporates the most innovative alerting and self-monitoring system.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999904632568359}",positive,0.9999904632568359,1

The airline intends to begin these international flights in 2015, and its first such destination will be the United Status. The flights will originate from their brand new $1.5 billion terminal at Viracopos-Campinas International Airport located outside São Paulo, Brazil. While the company will formally announce the US destinations later in the year, it is rumored that New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport and Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport in Florida, both strongholds of JetBlue Airways, will be the initial destinations.

Azul is the brainchild of David Neeleman, the founder or co-founder of Morris Air, Westjet and JetBlue Airways. The new flights will initially be operated with a fleet of Airbus A330-200 aircraft leased from International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC). Following those aircraft, deliveries of leased Airbus A350-900 aircraft will start in early 2017. Neeleman said of the announcement, “Our customers have been asking for this and now we look forward to providing them with our superior service on international flights, just as we have been doing today on our 880 domestic departures”. He concluded in the announcement, “We’re excited to share the Azul experience with new customers internationally and expand the airline’s success story beyond Brazil’s borders”.

Azul, which started operations in 2008, currently operates a fleet of 80 Embraer E195s, E190s and E175s, as well as 56 ATR turboprop regional airliners. The airline serves 104 destinations throughout Brazil. Its onboard experience is very similar to that of JetBlue and the airline has grown to hold a 16% market share of the Brazilian market. The new service will provide competition to the more internationally established Brazilian carrier TAM as well as US carriers such as American Airlines and Delta Air Lines.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8643333315849304}",neutral,0.8643333315849304,0
Airbus A350 available in ten-across in economy – Business Traveller - Business Traveller,"Mon, 07 Apr 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzdHJhdmVsbGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMTQvMDQvMDcvYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtYXZhaWxhYmxlLWluLXRlbi1hY3Jvc3MtaW4tZWNvbm9teS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has confirmed that its new A350 aircraft can be set-up in a “high-efficiency” configuration of ten-across in economy.

The manufacturer admitted that, although it would prefer airlines to go with a nine-across seating configuration, guaranteeing passengers a seat width of 18 inches, one airline has already ordered the ten-across variant.

Airbus last year launched a campaign showcasing research that passengers increasingly seek to research seat comfort prior to travelling (see news, November 18). Business Traveller has previously reported that the A350 would likely be configured ten-across by some carriers (see forum, October 29).

It would seem that this is the manufacturer’s attempt to persuade airlines that they should go for the nine-across configuration rather than ten-across.

But as Chris Emerson, Airbus’ senior vice-president of marketing, pointed out: “It’s our job to give the airlines the platform, but then they have to decide how to utilise it.”

It presents Airbus with a challenge similar to that faced by Boeing, which has seen some of the customer benefits of the new cabin eroded by most carriers opting for nine-across seating instead of the eight-across seating (see opinion, December 11).

Airbus has a total of 812 orders for the A350 aircraft in its various configurations — A350-800, A350-900 and A350-1000 — and admits that one customer has already ordered the “high-efficiency” configuration in economy of ten-across.

The A350-800 will carry 276 passengers, the A350-900 315 passengers and the A350-1000 369 passengers.

The news came as Airbus today unveiled details of both its Customer Definition Centre and of the onboard product catalogue available to airline customers.

The new centre allows airline customers to choose from a range of customisation options for the new aircraft, including the type of seating on board, and its configuration.

"Odds and End: ExIm fight, again; A350 interior; C-17 production ending early; 787's longest routes; That's no bull; MH370 - Leeham News and Analysis","Tue, 08 Apr 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL2xlZWhhbW5ld3MuY29tLzIwMTQvMDQvMDgvb2Rkcy1hbmQtZW5kLWV4aW0tZmlnaHQtYWdhaW4tYTM1MC1pbnRlcmlvci1jLTE3LXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tZW5kaW5nLWVhcmx5LTc4N3MtbG9uZ2VzdC1yb3V0ZXMtdGhhdHMtbm8tYnVsbC1taDM3MC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ExIm fight, again: Republicans and the conservative Heritage Foundation are once again attempting to kill the US ExIm Bank, which providing financing support for Boeing airplanes.

This isn’t a sexy topic for our readers, but it’s an important issue we’ve written about many times. While the Republicans and Heritage call this corporate welfare (of which we’re generally disdainful), we disagree in this instance. It’s a matter of competitiveness.

Loren Thompson, with whom we’ve often disagreed, and whose institute is partly funded by Boeing, takes on the effort to kill ExIm in this column. His underlying facts are valid, though his tiresome shot at Airbus subsidies and Boeing’s innocence is laughable once more. The WTO found Boeing received illegal subsidies, too, and of course we just witnessed Boeing getting the largest subsidy in corporate history from Washington (State, that is)–all of which Thompson ignores.

But this National Review magazine (a conservative one) fails in its taking Thompson to task to even mention Airbus, the principal thrust of Thompson’s piece. This is as silly as Thompson’s continued Airbus bashing.

The reason we support ExIm’s continued existence has nothing to do with who gets what subsidies; it has everything to do with the fact that Europe’s export credit agencies fund Airbus airplanes and Boeing needs to have ExIm to compete. (We’d be less harsh about Thompson if he would stick to this topic rather than beating the subsidy drum with highly selective facts on an issue for which he was paid by Boeing to issue a study during the WTO dispute.)

National Review’s critique of Thompson totally ignores the Airbus export credit support challenge. There may be merit to many practices about ExIm to criticize, but these critics need to focus on the ECA competitive advantage for Airbus should ExIm go away. Boeing’s right on this one.

A350 interior: The big Interiors Show is underway this week at Hamburg and the world gets its first look at the Airbus A350 XWB interior. USA Today has a series of photos. So does CNN.

Airbus also talked about the prospect of jamming in (our term, not Airbus’) 10 abreast in the A350. This is, of course, ironic because Airbus is in the midst of a campaign about the 18-inch seating for its nine abreast configuration. While we certainly agree that 18 inches are far more comfortable than the 17+ inch seat bottom in the Boeing 777 (at 10 abreast), we note the economic advantage Boeing has at 10 abreast to the nine abreast A350 and think this has as much to do with Airbus’ campaign as any passenger comfort.

What’s the economic difference? Our colleague in Europe did the analysis. He writes:

The -1000 and -300ER both have the same length cabin so both seat about 360 pax in 2 class: 54 business class seats at 60” and 306 economy seats at 32” =360 seats. Make them 10 abreast and you add 35 seats for both as they have about 35 rows of Y. Therefore 10 abreast lowers the per seat cost by 8.6%.

.

The 779 has 62m cabin, so you get 54*60” and 38 rows of 9 abreast = 342 for 396 9 abreast 2 class and 38*10=380 + 54 = 434 seats in 10 abreast. 396/434=91.2%, thereby 8.8% lower seat costs.

You gain 8% with 10 abreast as you burn a little more fuel with the heavier cabin.

C-17 production ending early: It’s the last of the McDonnell Douglas/Douglas Aircraft Co. heritage: the MDC-designed C-17 production will end next summer, about three months earlier than previously announced. This also will end aircraft production at the former MDC plant in Long Beach (CA), where the then-Douglas Aircraft Co. first produced the DC-8 through the MD-95 and the C-17. Boeing ended production of the MD-88, MD-90 and MD-11 after the two companies merged. It kept the MD-95 alive for a time as the Boeing 717, ending this production with just 156 built. There had been a prospect of building the 777X there, but Seattle won when IAM 751 ratified a new contract. There were those who always thought Long Beach, and other locations, were nothing more than a stalking horse to beat 751 into submission.

787’s longest routes: Forbes lists the longest routes for the Boeing 787, once you get past all the advertising pages.

That’s no bull: For those who still think there was a fire on Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 that occurred so quickly no distress call could be made, consider this story.

Airbus A350: Ready for take-off – Business Traveller - Business Traveller,"Wed, 30 Apr 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzdHJhdmVsbGVyLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9yZWFkeS1mb3ItdGFrZS1vZmYv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If all goes to plan, this autumn, Qatar Airways will be the launch customer of the new Airbus A350 XWB. The twin-engine aircraft has been built by Airbus as a competitor to Boeing’s B787 Dreamliner.

So far, the A350 comes in not one size but three: the A350-800, which will carry 276 passengers; the A350-900, accommodating 315 passengers; and the A350-1000, seating 369. It is the A350-900 that is being manufactured first, with Qatar Airways expected to operate the first commercial flight at the end of the year.

Last month, Airbus unveiled its Customer Definition Centre in Hamburg. This new facility is the place where potential customers are persuaded that this is the aircraft for them, and where they will decide on the exact configuration.

While the centre officially opened in April, by then, 14 customers had already been through the process, choosing everything from the fabric and colour scheme of their planes to the seating and galley options.

The process is important for a number of reasons. First, without airlines being persuaded to buy new aircraft, we would never be able to fly on them. It doesn’t matter how improved or revolutionary an aircraft is, if the carriers aren’t convinced, the only place we’re going to see them is in computer-generated pictures, or perhaps in a corner of a museum reserved for glorious failures.

As Chris Emerson, Airbus’s senior vice-president for marketing, puts it: “The A350 has been designed and built with the marketplace in mind.” Unlike in the days of Concorde, today manufacturers respond to the requirements of airlines.

Emerson says: “The process is about much more than how many seats fit on these aircraft. It’s also who is sitting in these seats – are they on business or leisure trips? How price sensitive are they? Are they flying on trunk routes or newly established routes?”

The A350 has to cater for all of these possibilities, hence the degree to which it can be customised by the airlines. In one of the Airbus centre’s rooms is a mock-up of the aircraft interior, where various seating configurations can be tried out.

To keep things as simple as possible, Airbus has developed a catalogue approach to the options, compiling a list of approved suppliers of seats, fabrics and in-flight entertainment from which the airlines can choose.

Responding to airlines’ demands has meant doubling the size of the catalogue and the number of suppliers in the past 12 months alone, says Emerson, a process likely to continue as carriers seek to assert their own stamp of individuality.

How revolutionary is the A350? There is little doubt it is “new generation” when it comes to the construction and materials (see below). The innovation extends even to the tips of the wings.

Aircraft manufacturers discovered decades ago that adding winglets to the end of the wings reduces the spiral-shaped vortices that form, which create aerodynamic drag. The large version on the A350 XWB are what Airbus calls “sharklets” – they were pioneered on the A320 and can add both range or payload capacity.

In addition, the wings have been designed by extensive modelling with CFD (computational fluid dynamics) followed by wind tunnel testing, resulting in a highly tapered planform (the shape and layout of an aircraft’s fuselage and wing).

In addition, the wing “morphs” during flight, with onboard computer systems intelligently controlling the A350 XWB wing’s moving surfaces to tailor it for maximum aerodynamic efficiency in the various phases of flight.

Still, for flyers, much will depend on the airlines and how they can configure it. When Boeing brought out the B787, it wanted airlines to restrict economy seats to a 2-4-2 layout.

The first customer, ANA, did that initially, but subsequently, almost all customers (including ANA) went for a denser 3-3-3 configuration, and feedback from flyers has not been positive (see “Missed opportunity: why the B787 fails the comfort test in economy”, in Opinion).

The A350 has a wider fuselage than the B787 (5.61 metres versus 5.49 metres) so can more comfortably fit nine-abreast seating, with an average width of 18 inches in economy.

Probably not coincidently, Airbus has been running a campaign showcasing research on what customers want from airline seating, and it’s a minimum of 18 inches width.

When asked whether this was Airbus trying to persuade airlines, through educating the public, that they should not go for ten-across seating on the A350, Emerson said that he believed most airlines would go for nine-across but that in certain markets, where price sensitivity was high, some carriers had already ordered ten-across.

He wouldn’t release any names, although one has been widely rumoured to be a low-cost Asian carrier.

In truth, it is more likely that airlines opting for ten-abreast seating will be doing so to make flying affordable on routes that were not previously served by air, but by train or boat – given the discomfort of 24 hours on a train, ten-abreast would be less of a problem.

We will have to wait until the A350’s entry into service at the end of the year to experience the benefits. Until then, there are always the photos…

AIRLINE ORDERS

At the end of March, Airbus had orders for 812 A350 aircraft, ranging from the A350-800 to the A350-1000.

Almost 40 customers have been announced, and they include pretty much every airline you will have heard of, from Aer Lingus, Air France, British Airways, Finnair and Lufthansa, through to Asian carriers such as Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines, and Gulf carriers such as Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways – the last of which is the launch customer.

Traditionally, US carriers ordered Boeing aircraft, but in the order book for the A350 you’ll find American Airlines – it took over the US Airways orders with its merger – while United and Delta have put out tenders to both Boeing and Airbus for aircraft in this range.

It poses stiff competition for Boeing’s own B787, although, of course, this has its own order book of more than 1,000 and climbing. a350xwb.com



EIGHT REASONS WHY THE A350 IS SOMETHING SPECIAL

SPACE

The A350 XWB has a 220-inch (5.61-metre) fuselage cross-section, which Airbus says will allow for a standard 18-inch-wide seat in economy.

INTERIOR DESIGN

As with the B787, when entering through the main door, a large illuminated dome has been created in the overhead ceiling, adding to the feeling of spaciousness in the cabin.

Throughout, the interior has smooth curves, flowing lines, innovative lighting and wide windows, creating a more pleasant ambience for flights.

WINDOWS

The aircraft has wide panoramic windows that Airbus says “create large angles of vision so that passengers of all sizes have a good view of the outside world”.

LIGHTING

The cabin is fitted with a full-LED lighting system that has more than 16 million colour options and is controllable both lengthwise and side-to-side.

AIR QUALITY

High-precision air management systems change the cabin air every two to three minutes through the latest in purifying filters and ozone removers, without creating drafts.

Air temperature control allows for up to eight different climate zones throughout the aircraft for passengers, as well as four additional areas for crew.

CABIN PRESSURE

Lower cabin altitude pressure, which “contributes to the feeling of well-being, even on the longest-range trips”.

EFFICIENCY

The aircraft uses up to 25 per cent less fuel than the A330.

IN-FLIGHT ENTERTAINMENT

It is the first jetliner to integrate fourth-generation systems from the outset, with high-bandwidth fibre optics allowing high-definition video, and seat monitors also upgraded to new standards – beginning with screens of up to 12 inches in economy and no bulky under-seat control boxes blocking passenger legroom.

Combined data and power cables are accommodated under a flat cabin floor.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999909400939941}",neutral,0.9999909400939941,0

Plan to squeeze extra seats on Airbus A380 - The Telegraph,"Tue, 01 Apr 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay90cmF2ZWwvbmV3cy9QbGFuLXRvLXNxdWVlemUtZXh0cmEtc2VhdHMtb24tQWlyYnVzLUEzODAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Flightglobal, an aviation news website, reported last month that the aircraft manufacturer is to give airlines the option of an extra 35 to 40 economy class seats on board its biggest model. The innovation will be made possible by raising the floor two inches in the widest part of the aircraft.

A mock-up of the new interior will be shown at the Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg from April 8-10.

The new designs could well appeal to airlines. As Telegraph Travel recently reported , carriers have spent the last few years applying the squeeze to economy class cabins.

On board the Boeing 777, for example, one of the world’s biggest selling models, the normal seating arrangement was once nine seats per row, rather than 10. In 2010, just 15 per cent of the 74 777s delivered to airlines could seat 10 abreast. In 2012, that leapt to 69 per cent.

And on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, 90 per cent of airlines have opted to include nine seats across each row since its introduction, rather than a more comfortable eight.

It would also allow airlines to increase the number of economy class seats without sacrificing space in premium sections. But passengers are less likely to approve, as seating 11 abreast would mean those in the middle seat having to contend with being boxed in by two passengers on either side.

The current configuration in economy class

While the A380 is certified to carry up to 853 passengers on its two decks, (which would require an all-economy class configuration), all the airlines that use the model utilise a two- or three-class system with capacity for far fewer fliers. British Airways, for example, seats 469 passengers on its A380s, Lufthansa can fit 526, and Qantas 484.

Test aircraft MSN 002, hangared at the airframer’s local assembly and completions complex, is the first of the A350 test fleet to be outfitted with a cabin – in this case configured with a two-class layout designed to show off the twinjet’s “extra-wide” 221in (5.6m) fuselage and “fourth-generation” systems.

The economy-class cabin features nine-abreast, 18in-wide seats. MSN 002 – which made its first flight on 26 February – is also fully wired up with test instrumentation to monitor the climate control and other passenger-comfort systems. Dummy “passengers” each emit 100W to simulate the challenge posed to the air conditioning by real passengers.

In the business-class section, the prototype shows off the A350’s “high ceiling” option. Huge storage bins on the sides are big enough to accommodate more than two carry-on items per business-class passenger, doing away with the need for the central overhead bins and opening up the cabin space.

MSN 002 will be carrying out a series of “early long flights” and “hot and cold” cabin trials to help ensure that cabin systems, like flight systems, are fully reliable when the first customer aircraft is delivered, to Qatar Airways, late this year.

Chris Emerson, Airbus senior vice-president of marketing, calls the A350 the only aircraft in its sector to truly offer “comfort without compromise”. Airlines, he says, have huge flexibility in specifying the interior of an A350: “It ’s not a question of the number of seats; it’s a question of who’s in those seats and where they are going to.”

The MSN002 model's passenger interior has been revealed following a test flight in February of this year, showcasing the brand's ""eXtra-wide"" fuselage. Passengers will benefit from more personal space, notably due to the wide 18-inch seats in the 9-abreast economy cabin.



""Passenger comfort is an increasingly important differentiator for the airline industry, becoming a fundamental deciding factor driving passenger choice and business success,"" said Chris Emerson, Senior Vice President of Marketing at Airbus. ""The A350 XWB is the only aircraft in its sector to truly offer ‘comfort without compromise', while providing airlines with unrivalled operating economics, flexibility and fuel efficiency.""



Additional potential features include LED lighting with 16.7 million possible colors for customized ambiances. Clients will also be able to choose from a range of fourth-generation IFE consoles, with electronics boxes integrated into the aircraft's floor design to free up space, while almost vertical walls make the cabin even more roomy.



The MSN002 now faces a rigorous testing program including ‘hot and cold' cabin trials and a series of ""Early Long Flights"" accommodating real passengers.



Airbus has also launched a dedicated A350 XWB Customer Definition Centre (CDC), a ‘one-stop shop' for airline companies to see, feel and test the real catalogue solutions presented in a showroom environment.

ALBERTO MARTÍN (EFE)

King Juan Carlos arrived in Spain 45 minutes behind schedule on Wednesday due to a mechanical failure in the Air Force A-310 airplane that had taken him to United Arab Emirates and Kuwait to seek investment opportunities for Spanish businesses, sources in the royal palace confirmed.

The fault, which was related to a fuel valve on one of the engines, was repaired by engineers in around 30 minutes. The plane in question was an Airbus A-310, which belongs to the government and carries the prime minister as well as the royal family.

The monarch was on his way to the King’s Cup soccer final, between Real Madrid and Barcelona, which was being held in Valencia on Wednesday night. He arrived in time to see the match.

The incident marks the fifth mechanical failure in aircraft used to transport members of the Spanish royal household in the last six months. In late March, Queen Sofía landed at Torrejón air base three hours late due to a breakdown in the official plane flying her back from Guatemala.

The king’s son, Prince Felipe, has also been delayed twice due to technical problems. In November 2013, the prince had to cancel a trip to Brazil because of a mechanical failure. Two months later, another glitch forced the heir to the Spanish throne to wait in Santo Domingo for nine hours, while on his way to Honduras for the swearing-in of the new president, Juan Orlando Hernández.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5357951521873474}",neutral,0.5357951521873474,0
More Qatar Airways A380 Info Revealed - Airline Reporter,"Wed, 30 Apr 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxNC8wNC9xYXRhci1haXJ3YXlzLWEzODAtaW5mby1yZXZlYWxlZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Qatar Airways has now set the date for their inaugural service for the newest aircraft in the fleet, the Airbus A380. Qatar has previously been very tight-lipped about their newest aircraft, giving just small glimpses of the on-board environment or a tease of their intended destinations (London & Paris). When they released information on the first class seats at the ITB event in Berlin in March, this was our first glimpse into the gulf carrier’s plans for the whale jet.

On June 17th, 2014, when QR3 departs the new Hamad International Airport (HIA) in Doha it will be the first flight of the airline’s new A380. As it heads for London, it will bring upon a new era in the airline’s growth. These flights are actually a swap of one of the current six flights per day, from a 777-300ER to the new A380. This is a good thing, as it takes a two-cabin aircraft and swaps it out for the latest and greatest Qatar has to offer.

The A380 for Qatar will be in a three-class configuration with eight First Class, 48 Business and 461 Economy Class seats across both decks of the A380. The Business Class seats will more than likely be the same reverse herringbone configuration that is currently onboard their Boeing 787s and will compliment the new First Class offering. The Economy Class seats, however, have not been released, though I would suspect it would be a common seat option with the 787 as well.

BONUS: Re-live the delivery of Qatar Airways’ First Boeing 787-8 – Part 1, Part 2, Part 3

Unfortunately, the airline has not released any official seat maps as yet, however rumors are everywhere amongst AvGeek’s about the internal configuration. What is known is that First & Business class will share common space thanks to some teaser images that were released recently from Qatar Airways.

The new images show not only the First & Business class lounge on the aircraft, but also a glimpse into one of the First Class bathrooms. Qatar Airways Chief Executive Officer, His Excellency Mr. Akbar Al Baker, said that the airline’s A380 is bound to create new benchmarks in inflight experience.

’œUnrivaled onboard passenger comfort is an increasingly important differentiator and is becoming a fundamental deciding factor driving passenger choice ’“ and Qatar Airways has designed its A380 with this firmly in mind.’ The images confirm this with the dark burgundy colors that are seen on other Qatar aircraft, and also with the deep brown wood that is seen on the interiors of their 787.

With the first of 13 new A380s set to be delivered any time now, and the opening of HIA planned soon, the A380 will be a new step up in the world for this ever-expanding airline. Later this year, Qatar also expects to launch the first A350 as well. At the moment, seats for the first A380 service on the 17th of June are on sale in all three classes, so if you’re in the area, why not get on that first flight!

For its long haul fleet Azul is to lease the following:

Six Airbus A330-200s, which will commence operations in 2015.

Five Airbus A350-900s, , which will commence operations in 2017.



The future Azul Airbus Aircraft – A350-900 in the foreground, A330-200 in the background. Image Azul.

This will change the airline from a regional player to an international operation

Azul will lease the aircraft from International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) for eight of the aircraft, and is negotiating over the lease or purchase of the remaining A330s. The plans will be powered by Rolls Royce Trent 700 and Trent XWB engines.

The planes are planned to be three class planes.

So who are Azul going up against? Well, there’s the LATAM combined airline (TAM) and Avianca Brazil who both run long haul international services, domestic and regional services in the area. In addition, there are the big US carriers who are flying in and out of the area too.

This could be really interesting if the product can compete with TAM, Avancia and other international airlines who serve the region.

Price will also be a differentiator as it always is. Will the new aircraft give Azul a big push forward?

Time will tell. It is exciting though!","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999207258224487}",neutral,0.9999207258224487,0

”And the Winner is…” — Taking a Closer Look at the 2014 Airline Quality Rating Report By Guest Contributor 14 Apr 2014 This story was written by John Cameron for AirlineReporter… The 2014 Airline Quality Rating report was released last week and, for the second year in a row, Virgin America was ranked #1 amongst major US carriers. How did the other airlines fare? Who received the dubious distinction of being ranked worst? You’ll have to read on to find out. But first, a bit of background information. The Airline Quality Rating (AQR) report has been published annually since 1991. Yes, 24 years. That’s a long, long time in the commercial aviation industry. To put that into perspective, consider that the AQR predates the prohibition of in-flight smoking in the US (1998), the Embraer ERJ family (1995), the Boeing 777 (1994), the Airbus A330 (1992), and even the ubiquitous Bombardier CRJ (which took to the air one month after the inaugural AQR report was released). Back then, as the 1990s were just dawning, professors Brent Bowen and Dean Headley realized that the majority of existing airline rating systems relied heavily on subjective surveys of customer opinion that were infrequently collected and largely unreliable. What was needed was a timely, objective, and quantitative rating system that could be used to compare airline performance from year to year. Thus, the Airline Quality Rating was born.

Airline Livery of the Week: Flybe and Their New Purple Design By Guest Contributor 12 Apr 2014 FlyBe, based at Exeter, Devon, in the UK is Europe’s largest regional airline. It was born as Jersey European Airways out of a merger between Jersey, Channel Islands-based Intra Airways and Bournemouth, UK-based Express Air Services in November, 1979, and established a network of services out of the Channel Islands, mainly to other UK points. In June 2000, the airline cheekily renamed itself ’˜British European’, using the ex-British European Airways (BEA – now British Airways) flight prefix code ’˜BE’, rebranding as ’˜FlyBe’ in July, 2002. In November 2006, FlyBe expanded again by buying the British Airways’ regional group, ’˜BA Connect’ (apart from their services out of London City Airport, which are operated by BA CityFlyer), with part of the payment to BA being a 15% stock transfer. At the start of 2008, FlyBe signed a franchise agreement with Scottish-based airline Loganair. This agreement became effective when their franchise agreement with British Airways was terminated the following October. Loganair’s aircraft now operate in FlyBe’s colors on over 50 routes out of Scottish airports including the ’˜Highlands & Islands’ services.

Airbus: Aviation's future cities to watch - TRBusiness,"Wed, 02 Apr 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL3JlZ2lvbmFsLW5ld3MvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9leGNsdXNpdmUtYXZpYXRpb25zLWZ1dHVyZS1jaXRpZXMtdG8td2F0Y2gvNjY5MzfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airport locations that will have sizeable numbers of international passengers passing through them are set to increase dramatically between now and 2032 – which is good news for duty free and travel retailers looking to target the most lucrative gateways of the future.

But it is worth noting that, by 2022, it is in mature markets where a lot of the growth will take place rather than emerging nations, with China conspicuous by its relative absence.

According to European aircraft manufacturer Airbus, the number of what it defines as ‘aviation mega-cities’ [those with more than 10,000 daily long-haul (≥ 2,000 nautical miles) international passengers] is set to more than double from 42 in 2012 to 89 by 2032 (see charts).

That will push up the number of daily long-haul passengers from today’s 0.8m to 2.2m within 20 years. Airbus also notes that while 92% of long-haul traffic currently goes to/from the 42 mega-cities today, by 2032 that will rise to 99%, indicating that there will be a concentration of aviation power – and retail focus with it – in these locations.

TRBusiness asked Airbus which will be the newly emerging mega-cities of the future to watch. By 2022, the aircraft manufacturer – based on its own research and estimates – points to 27 new locations breaking the 10,000 daily barrier. Another 20 will emerge by 2032.

The 27 are: Addis Ababa (Ethiopia), Auckland (New Zealand), Barcelona (Spain), Brisbane (Australia), Brussels (Belgium), Guangzhou (China), Dallas (US), Denpasar Bali (Indonesia), Detroit (US), Houston (US), Jeddah (Saudi Arabia), Jakarta (Indonesia), Lima (Peru), Lisbon (Portugal), Lagos (Nigeria), Mexico City (Mexico), Milan (Italy), Manila (Philippines), Nairobi (Kenya), Perth (Australia), Philadelphia (US), Panama City (Panama), Rio De Janeiro (Brazil), Riyadh (Saudi Arabia), Santiago (Chile), Seattle (US), and Taipei (Taiwan).

CHINA DOESN’T MAKE THE GRADE

While there are emerging market cities among the 27, what the 2022 list shows is that a large proportion of new mega-cities will be in developed markets. For example, five cities in the US will enter the 10,000 international passengers per day category: Dallas, Detroit, Houston, Philadelphia and Seattle. Meanwhile there are a further three in Australasia (Auckland, Brisbane and Perth); and in Europe another four make the list (Barcelona, Brussels, Lisbon and Milan).

Interestingly, in mainland China only Guangzhou makes it to mega-city status, joining Beijing and Shanghai, while in Africa, both Lagos and Nairobi will join Johannesburg as the key international hubs on the continent.

Emirates to switch a Frankfurt flight to an A380 - Economy Class & Beyond - Kevin Marshall,"Sun, 06 Apr 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vZWNvbm9teWNsYXNzYW5kYmV5b25kLmJvYXJkaW5nYXJlYS5jb20vMjAxNC8wNi8wNC9lbWlyYXRlcy10by1zd2l0Y2gtZnJhbmtmdXJ0LWZsaWdodHMtdG8tYW4tYTM4MC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With the largest fleet of Airbus A380s in the sky, Emirates can make their presence felt anywhere – even if they deploy it for just one rotation a day.

Emirates will be sending one of their A380s to operate its Dubai to Frankurt-am-Main service, switching out an Boeing 777-300ER in the process. As the airline operates only one flight a day to Dubai, a capacity boost will help no end.

The A380 will operate on the EK45/EK46 rotation on the following times from 1st September:

EK45 DEPART DXB 08:25 ARRIVE FRA 13:15 EK46 DEPART FRA 15:20 ARRIVE DXB 23:55 Operates with a Boeing 777-300ER until 31st August 2014 Operates with an Airbus A380 from 1st September 2014 Operates Daily

Seats are available for booking with them showing on the Emirates booking engine.



Flights listed on Emirates.com – EK45/46 showing as an A380.



Emirates offer three flights a day to Frankfurt, with the other flights operated using Boeing 777-300ERs. The other option is of course the single daily flight by German flag carrier Lufthansa.

A 519 seater A380 will be used in the deployment, which should allow passengers to connect in more comfort that the Boeing 777-300ERs that cover the route. With the plane shuttling between Dubai and Frankfurt, there should be plenty of opportunities for connections to the Eastbound bank of flights at Dubai.

And remember me saying Emirates have the largest A380 fleet going? It’s 48 aircraft strong. The airline needs these planes full and flying to pay for them.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999976396560669}",neutral,0.999976396560669,0
EASA certifies redesigned EC225 gear shaft - Vertical Mag - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 23 Apr 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVzL2Vhc2FjZXJ0aWZpZXNyZWRlc2lnbmVkZWMyMjVnZWFyc2hhZnQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The redesigned vertical bevel gear shaft for Airbus Helicopters’ EC225 has been certified, enabling its production and retrofit on the aircraft’s global fleet, as well as its installation on all future EC225s.

The new design, certified by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), eliminates all three factors that, in combination, had caused two vertical shaft ruptures in 2012, resulting in two high-profile controlled ditchings in the North Sea. Airbus Helicopters said the shaft provides corrosion resistance, compensates for residual stress and eliminates stress hot spots.

Manufacturing of the redesigned gear shaft is already underway, and Airbus Helicopters said worldwide retrofit and installation would begin in the second half of 2014.

“Airbus Helicopters has put a very high priority on developing this new shaft for the EC225,” said Jean-Brice Dumont, Airbus Helicopters’ executive vice president of engineering. “EASA’s certification is a major milestone towards getting our customers flying with the final solution.”

Root of the problem

To fully understand what Airbus Helicopters has done to fix the problem (and why) —the mechanical failure mode common to both 2012 ditchings must be explored.

The main gearbox of the EC225 normally contains 22 liters of oil circulated by a pressure lubrication system. The system incorporates a main and a standby oil pump, both of which are mechanically driven by a bevel gear mounted to a vertical shaft at the bottom of the gearbox. This shaft, a two-part welded assembly, is installed in all EC225s and some AS332 L1 and L2 helicopters.

The certification criteria demand that a failure of both oil pumps should not be catastrophic. EASA regulations under which the EC225 was certified require that helicopters be capable of continued safe flight under prescribed conditions for at least 30 minutes following a total failure of the gearbox lubrication system; a feature typically called a “run dry” capability. In lieu of actually running dry, the EC225 further incorporates a separate emergency lubrication system, consisting of an 11 litre tank of a glycol-water mixture, called Hydrosafe 620. When activated, bleed air pressure from the left engine delivers a spray of Hydrosafe 620 from nozzles around the interior of the gearbox, providing sufficient fluid for at least 30 minutes of gearbox cooling and lubrication. The system is controlled by a dedicated circuit board which monitors inputs from pressure transducers on the engine bleed-air line and the coolant feed line. The onboard vehicle monitoring system (VMS) will warn the crew of emergency lubrication system malfunction if pressure in either line drops below a prescribed threshold.

Initially, in the case of both accidents, the crew was confronted with indications of loss of gearbox oil pressure, which required activation of the emergency lubrication system. And, in each case, the “MGB EMLUB” caption subsequently illuminated, indicating failure of the back-up lubrication system. In accordance with the checklist procedure to “land immediately”, both crews proceeded to perform a controlled ditching at sea. Fortunately all passengers and crew were rescued.

So, what happened? The accidents were caused by two separate failure modes. Initially a circumferential failure of the weld on the vertical shaft precipitated the loss of gearbox oil pressure. The subsequent failure of the emergency lubrication system can be chalked up to a minor boo-boo with major ramifications. Owing to an error in the specification to a switch supplier, the emergency lubrication system indicated that it had failed when in fact it was operating normally. The faulty specification created a dormant failure of the system; the system working exactly as it was wired, but certainly not as designed. Post-accident investigation on both helicopters confirmed that Hydrosafe 620 had been introduced into the gearbox, and no evidence of heat damage to the gearboxes was found. The crew had no way of knowing that the emergency lubrication system was operative, so under the circumstances ditching the helicopters was the appropriate course of action.

Finding a Solution

When Vertical visited Airbus Helicopters’ headquarters in Marignane, France, late last year, the company was very forthright about the outcome of the two gearbox-related accidents. I sat down to chat with Andrew Warner, chief test pilot, and Patrick Bremond, head of the Test Center. Their personnel were extensively involved in EC225 investigation for the better part of a year. They said that while inspections found no cracks in other in-service helicopters, the failure mode of the weld could be replicated on a test rig. The vertical shaft was redesigned and tested.

Interestingly, the original certification requirements did not demand that the emergency lubrication system be tested in an actual helicopter. Certification tests were performed on a ground rig, using pressurized air to simulate engine bleed air to spray Hydrosafe 620 into the gearbox. Subsequent to the accidents, Airbus Helicopters went well beyond those tests. In a remarkable demonstration, Airbus Helicopters Test Pilot Hervé Jammayrac was tasked to fly an EC225 with a deliberately cracked vertical shaft until it failed. The test proved both the integrity of the gearbox following failure and the in-situ performance of the emergency lubrication system.

One of the outcomes of the investigation was that the onboard health and usage monitoring system (HUMS) was able to register a change in gearbox vibration in the hours before the accidents that proved indicative of the eventual vertical shaft failure. Two data signals which indicate the meshing frequencies of the bevel gear and the oil pump drive pinions were discovered in retrospect to have recorded exceedances. As an outcome of the accidents, an interim measure was taken to install a software update and a HUMS caution light on the instrument panel to facilitate monitoring. In the event that the light illuminated, the crew was to limit flight duration to two hours; sufficient endurance for a return to base. As an ironic milestone from the accidents, Janick Blanc, vice president for EC225 and Super Puma programs, told me that “the EC225 has become the first helicopter to use HUMS for flight limit monitoring.” This experience certainly highlights the value of HUMS as a means of ongoing diagnostic monitoring.

It has been a long road for Airbus Helicopters, and no doubt for EC225 operators, but the manufacturer said it has employed an unprecedented engineering effort to develop the permanent solution. Now, with EASA certification secured, it said validation of the redesigned gear shaft will soon follow from other international airworthiness authorities.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995957016944885}",neutral,0.9995957016944885,0
Air India to lease 14 Airbus A-320s to strengthen domestic network - Business Today,"Thu, 24 Apr 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3RvZGF5LmluL2luZHVzdHJ5L2F2aWF0aW9uL3N0b3J5L2Fpci1pbmRpYS10by1sZWFzZS0xNC1haXJidXMtYS0zMjBzLXRvLXN0cmVuZ3RoZW4tZG9tZXN0aWMtbmV0d29yay00Njk3Ni0yMDE0LTA0LTI00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aiming to strengthen its domestic route network, Air India would lease 14 Airbus A-320s for up to six years in a phased manner from the current financial year.

The national carrier on Thursday re-issued a tender for leasing these planes which should not be more than six years old. The tender document said the quotations should be sent by May 29 when the technical bids would be opened.

These airplanes were being acquired in an all-economy configuration with 188 seats, in a bid to combat heightened competition on domestic routes.

The tender was issued again as the airline was not able to get the requisite number of new aircraft for delivery next year, Air India officials said.

As per the tender, the selected lessors should be able to supply on dry-lease up to three of these planes in 2014-15, up to five till 2015-16 and six till 2016-17.

Air India (erstwhile Indian Airlines) was one of the launch operators of the A-320 aircraft and had purchased 31 of them between 1989 to 1993. Again between 2006 and 2010, the airline bought 43 A-320 family aircraft that includes A-319s and A-321s.

Air India was also reconfiguring its A-321 aircraft to reduce Business Class seats from 20 to 12 and increase Economy seating, the officials said, adding that four A-320s and six A-321s have already been reconfigured.

Expecting deliveries of five more Dreamliners between May and November, the national carrier is raising a bridge loan of $500 million to finance the purchase of four of these aircraft and use them to launch flights to new destinations like Moscow, Rome and Milan.

Air India was awaiting certain approvals for the launch of these flights planned for later this year.

The national carrier, which has already inducted 13 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, expects deliveries of two more such planes in May, while another three of the total 27 ordered are slated to be delivered by the US manufacturer Boeing in June, August and November.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996888637542725}",neutral,0.9996888637542725,0
"Airbus A350 MSN2 photos cabin, interior, seats - Executive Traveller","Tue, 08 Apr 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtY2FiaW4tc2VhdHMtcmV2ZWFsZWTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has revealed the interior of its first passenger-ready A350 ahead of a late 2014 launch for the advanced jet.

The cabin of this special test aircraft is kitted out with both business class and economy cabins, as well as test equipment to keep a watchful eye on the jet as it goes through its paces.

Test aircraft are typically a bare bones affair – as our photo tour of Boeing's 787-9 ZB002 test jet showed – but this A350 is pretty much suited and booted.

Step inside for our exclusive photo-tour as Australian Business Traveller takes you from tip to tail of this special A350.

Note that the well-lit and oh-so-pretty photos in this set were issued by Airbus PR; the ones which are markedly less perfect, and often seem to have been taken during a disco lightshow, were snapped by AusBT. (Blame Airbus for the lightshow, as it couldn't resist showing off the A350's LED cabin lighting.)

Let's start with an introduction: meet MSN002 (the letters stand for Manufacturer Serial Number).

This is the first test aircraft in the A350 family to be fitted out with a full cabin.

It's also the first decked out in a new 'Carbon signature livery' to reflect the significant role of carbon-fibre composites in the plane's construction.

It's as much a showcase for the A350's cabin design and seating options as a showpony for the aircraft manufacturer itself.

After all, this is the first A350 that will whisk a full complement of passengers through the skies in a series of what Airbus calls 'early long flights'.

'Early' means prior to the aircraft's commercial debut with worldwide launch partner Qatar at the end of this year.

'Long' means flights of between eight and 12 hours, during which those passengers will enjoy a full meal service and working inflight entertainment system.

Read: Airbus to launch A350 'world tour' later this year

The lucky ones during these test flights will find themselves at the pointy end of the A350 where Airbus has installed two business class cabins using the familiar EADS Sogerma Solstys seats which afford direct aisle access for every passenger.

EADS is one of four business class seat suppliers listed in the Airbus catalogue of pre-approved 'premium' seats for airlines ordering the A350 – the others are Zodiac, Recaro and Jamco.

An Airbus spokesman confirmed to Australian Business Traveller that no first class seating is currently listed, although this will in time be added to the roster – especially for the larger and longer Airbus A350-1000, compared to the debutante A350-900.

The dressed-up business class cabin includes some set pieces.

For a wider view, here's a panoramic sweep through the A350's business class cabin.

Note how the cabin wall is very flat, compared to the curve of most aircraft.

Here's a closer view.

Airbus says this is part of the 'passenger-centric' thinking which went into the A350, in this instance so that travellers enjoy more personal space.

All overhead bins are designed to take five standard-sized cabin bags.

Down in economy Airbus has opted for slimline BEA Pinnacle seats in order to spruik maximum legroom and help highlight the A350's generous proportions – the plane's official title is the A350 XWB, with those letters standing for 'extra wide body'.

The 3-3-3 layout adheres to Airbus' promise of a standard 18 inch seat width for the A350's cheap seats.

However, the company admits that at least one airline has ordered the A350 with a tighter-squeeze 10 across layout (3-4-3) where the seat width comes back to 17 inches.

Also read: Airbus A350 – the 'ten seat across' squeeze is on

Take a peek under the seat and something's missing: there's no floor-mounted control box for the inflight entertainment system.

The A350's video system works by locating the hardware for each group of three seats under the floor and connecting the seats with thin but high-capacity fibre optic cables. This frees up all of the space under each seat for your feet and personal carry-on bag.

The rest of the economy cabin looks, well, pretty much like you'd expect.

There are seats. Lots of seats.

Airbus will sell three versions of the A350: the compact A350-800, the mid-sized -900 and the super-stretched A350-1000.

These are expected to respectively seat 270, 314 and 350 passengers in a standard three-class cabin, although only at up to nine seats across in economy and not the tighter 10 abreast layout.

Here are some panoramic sweeps through the economy class cabin.

But there's still room for some serious testing to be done during flights of this special aircraft.

For example, plastic pipes snaking over many of the seats are filled with water and can heated to a variety of temperatures to simulate the cabin environment when hundreds of people are on board for hours on end.

Airbus says the heating systems run from 70 watts to 160 watts, with 90 watts being used to represent the average passenger.

This bank of monitors located at the front of one of the economy cabins allows Airbus engineers to keep track of pretty much everything that happens on the A350.

At the very rear of the A350 is a door to one of two upstairs crew rest areas.

We weren't able to clamber up into this loft space, but it's similar to that of the Boeing 787 and Boeing 777-300ER.

Airbus says it used flight attendants from Air France-KLM in designing the loft because they are apparently the world's tallest crew – so if they can climb up the stairs and settle into their bunk without bending into some yoga-like pose, then the space is good enough for any crew.

The routes and timings allow reasonable connections across Singapore Airlines network, whilst giving customers a choice of what equipment to choose. In addition, with an A380 coming in on each route, both routes frequency will drop to twice daily as opposed to the three times a day.

With the first carrier coming in, Emirates must be carefully planning a move to drop its A380s in too. Other A380 carriers will be watching in the background to see if its worth deploying the superjumbo to India.

If you’re a passenger, this could be a golden time, as carriers will be forced to compete on time, price and product.

Passengers on Finnair's long-haul services will be among the first in the world to experience the cutting-edge technology aboard the Airbus A350, with the Finnish airline scheduled to receive the new aircraft in the autumn of 2015.

“Although today's aircraft are perceived to be computers, this is in a different class due to the security software,” highlighted Jari Paajanen, the head of Finnair's Airbus unit, in his address on aircraft technology during an aviation safety seminar in Helsinki on Tuesday.

One of the new features of the aircraft is a digital signature, which is stamped on all transferable files to ensure that no unauthenticated data can infiltrate the on-board system.

Finnair is set to bring home the first four Airbus A350 aircraft in roughly one year's time, after testing on the aircraft has been completed.

The most recent new large aircraft, the Boeing Dreamliner, has been pestered with recurrent battery problems.

Will passengers aboard Finnair flights have to endure similar teething problems?

“No, they won't,” assures Paajanen. “The aircraft will be flown for a year before the first passenger is allowed aboard.”

In addition, Paajanen calls attention to the fact that the Boeing Dreamliner was developed from scratch, whereas the A350 also features technology used previously by Airbus. “The battery problems have been noticed. The A350 is not expected to experience them,” he reiterates.

Despite the cutting-edge security measures, the pilots can shut down the on-board system from the cockpit. “Thereby, it's possible to avoid the alleged scenario that someone could take control of the aircraft and re-route it to a desert island – although I'm unaware of a single software that could achieve that,” says Paajanen, referring to the theories tossed about concerning the recent disappearance of Malaysian Airlines flight 370.

At least one A350 airline has already chosen to stack 10 economy seats per row, an Airbus executive confirmed to Australian Business Traveller, in a layout which reduces the seat width to a tighter 17 inches.

""The A350's extra wide fuselage is designed to accommodate a standard nine abreast 3-3-3 configuration in economy at 18 inches between armrests"" says Chris Emerson, Airbus' senior vice-president of marketing.

""But some markets where they want to drive the cost-per-seat as low as possible are looking at the 10 abreast option, where you would be around 17 inches depending on the armrest and aisle width.""

This slide from today's Airbus A350 presentation details the seating configurations available to airlines.

Airbus tags the 3-4-3 layout as a ""high-efficiency"" configuration, although passengers will no doubt have a different name for it.

And while Emerson would prefer that all of Airbus' A350 customers got the 18 inch religion, he explains that ""It's our job to give the airlines the platform – then they have to decide how to utilise it.""

Airbus will sell three versions of the A350: the compact A350-800, the mid-sized -900 and the super-stretched A350-1000.

While Airbus hasn't trotted out an itinerary for its A350s, a glance through the list of the aircraft's customers – including Air France, Asiana, Cathay Pacific, Finnair, Japan Airlines, Singapore Airlines, TAM and United, plus the Gulf trio of Emirates, Etihad and launch customer Qatar – will provide some hints as to which countries may get a flying visit from the next-generation jet.

Both the test aircraft will be dressed in an eye-catching 'Carbon signature livery' which reflects the significant role of carbon-fibre composites in the plane's construction.

However, Airbus won't be promoting the A350 flights in the same way as Boeing's Dream Tour for the 787, which drew sizeable crowds at airports around the world and was hailed as a welcome PR success for the company following considerable delays to the Dreamliner's commercial debut.

""The flights are really designed around the certification program, to test all the elements in different environments"" Emerson tells Australian Business Traveller. ""They're not designed designed around taking to customers.""

The A350 has already made one 'virtual' flight in August last year, with 129 passengers and a Cathay Pacific crew inside a mock-up of the plane's cabin – dubbed Cabin Zero – took part in a four hour dry run complete with carry-on bags and a full meal service.

Photos: first Airbus A350 cabin and seats revealed

PREVIOUS | Airbus will unveil its first A350 cabin and seats tomorrow as the aircraft manufacturer gears up for the late 2014 launch of its next-generation jetliner.

The reveal will take place on Monday April 7th at Airbus' new Customer Definition Centre in Hamburg, where airlines with orders for the A350 will choose the fitout for their planes from tip to tail.

This 'one stop shop' facility, similar to Boeing's 787 Dreamliner Gallery in Seattle, includes 'showrooms' for a wide range of pre-approved seating from economy to first class, galleys, toilets and cabin equipment plus cabin design studios.

Airbus' order book for the A350 currently stands at some 38 airlines and leasing companies with 824 aircraft between them.

Qatar will be the A350's worldwide launch customer, with its first plane due to debut before year's end.

At an international Airbus press conference in June last year, A350 program director Didier Evrard told Australian Business Traveller that ""for the first customer (Qatar) the cabin is fully defined, we have modelled everything to a level that has never been achieved before.""

However, South America's LATAM Airline Group – comprising Chile's LAN and Brazil's TAM – has already afforded a sneak peak of their common cabin and seating designs for their shared Airbus A350 and Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner fleets to begin flying from 2015.

Arranged in a front-facing 2-2-2 layout, the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787-9 business class seats convert to fully lie-flat beds.

LATAM's designs come from highly-regarded consulting firm Priestmangoode, which most recently crafted TAM's slick Boeing 777 first class cabin.

The new A350 and 787-9 business class cabins clearly share some of that design DNA, with Priestmangoode saying the palette of natural tones was inspired by South America’s colours and textures.

The new economy seats are, well, pretty much what you'd expect.

Even before these designs took shape, a mock-up of the A350's cabin – dubbed Cabin Zero – made a 'virtual passenger flight' in August last year with 129 passengers and a Cathay Pacific crew.

Qantas: what to do with a spare Airbus A380..? - Executive Traveller,"Mon, 14 Apr 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vcWFudGFzLXdoYXQtdG8tZG8td2l0aC1hLXNwYXJlLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It's far from the worst problem for an airline to have, but Qantas will soon count an extra Airbus A380 in its fleet and is mulling exactly what to do with this spare superjumbo.

The airline will rejig the timetable for Qantas' daily Melbourne-London A380 flight in November this year, reducing the amount of time the A380 spends on the ground at Heathrow.

This will reduce from three to two the number of aircraft needed for this route, making that third A380 available to fly elsewhere on the Qantas network.

But where elsewhere?

""It could be on a new route, it could be on an existing one"" Qantas International CEO Simon Hickey told The Financial Review. ""We are evaluating our options at the moment.""

Dallas/Fort Worth Airport CEO Sean Donohue told The Financial Review that ""we would love to see Qantas bring the A380 in,” adding that ""we have expressed our interest and we would do anything and everything to facilitate.”

DFW is upgrading one terminal with three extra aerobridges to load passengers on the double-decker jet, and Qantas partner Emirates is set to begin A380 flights between DFW and Dubai from October 1.

Qantas' superjumbo slate

Qantas currently runs a Boeing 747-400 on the daily Sydney-Dallas flight, but boosting even one day a week to an A380 would require a pair of superjumbos.

The Flying Kangaroo's current A380 roster includes its flagship Sydney-London and Melbourne-London routes plus daily flights from Sydney and Melbourne to Los Angeles.

Qantas' only 'part time' A380 route is Sydney to Hong Kong, which was recently upgraded to see an A380 five days of the week (from Thursday to Monday) with a Boeing 747 on the remaining two days.

The airline currently has 12 Airbus A380s in its fleet with orders for eight more, but in February this year announced it would halt those outstanding orders ""with an ongoing review of delivery dates to meet potential future requirements.""
