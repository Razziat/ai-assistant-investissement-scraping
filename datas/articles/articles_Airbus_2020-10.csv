A subsidies scrap between Boeing and Airbus comes to an end (maybe) - The Economist,"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb25vbWlzdC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMC8xMC8xMy9hLXN1YnNpZGllcy1zY3JhcC1iZXR3ZWVuLWJvZWluZy1hbmQtYWlyYnVzLWNvbWVzLXRvLWFuLWVuZC1tYXliZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A 16 -YEAR FIGHT at the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) between Boeing, an American planemaker, and Airbus, a European one, over illegal subsidies resembles a heavyweight boxing bout in which both sides raise their gloves to claim the round. And so it was on October 13th, when the WTO ruled that the EU can impose tariffs on $4bn-worth of American goods annually. The award is lower than last year’s decision that America is allowed to slap duties on $7.5bn in European goods. But it was much higher than the Americans once braced for. More important, both aerospace titans look knocked about.

The counterpunching at the WTO began in 2004. After Airbus first overtook it in aircraft deliveries, Boeing complained that its rival was boosted by government support eventually amounting to $22bn in repayable “launch aid”. Airbus soon parried with its own claim that Boeing had benefited from $24bn in favourable tax breaks, as well as research-and-development support from NASA and the Pentagon.

The WTO eventually determined that both firms had received illegal subsidies. America used last year’s win to slap tariffs on everything from French cheese to Scotch. Airbus now faces levies of 15%. The EU will be permitted to impose its new duties after October 27th.

The latest ruling will not put paid to the bickering. Boeing says that the contentious tax break from Washington state has been repealed, so the looming EU tariffs are unjustified. Airbus says it is now in full compliance with the rules, and grumbles that the WTO appellate body that decides such matters is in limbo. America’s long-standing claims of unfair treatment at the hands of the body have led it to veto new appointments, leaving the arbiter inquorate.

With no knockout blow on either side, the spat may end in a negotiated settlement. America has been more reluctant to talk. But it may reconsider, given the size of the EU ’s permitted retaliation—and Boeing’s precarious position. The aerospace giant has more to fear from the devastating effect of the pandemic on the world’s air travel. The continued grounding of the 737 MAX , its cash cow, after two fatal crashes means that battered carriers are cancelling orders without penalty.

Airbus has not escaped unscathed. Last month it said it would cut more jobs on top of the 15,000, out of a global workforce of 130,000, announced in June. It has shaved output to 40% of capacity. Like Boeing, it has lost around half its market value since the start of the year."
Hydrogen in aviation: how close is it? - Airbus,"Thu, 08 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIwLTEwLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLWluLWF2aWF0aW9uLWhvdy1jbG9zZS1pcy1pdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Research into hydrogen as a potential energy carrier to power future zero-emission aircraft has been intensifying in recent years. But the road to hydrogen-powered aircraft requires significant effort inside the aviation industry and beyond. From hydrogen storage, cost and infrastructure to public perceptions about safety, the aviation sector is working to mature the technology while tackling some major challenges.

Hydrogen is increasingly considered as one of the most promising zero-emission technologies for future aircraft. However, despite the fact that hydrogen has an energy-density-per-unit mass that is three times higher than traditional jet fuel, a variety of challenges must be addressed before widespread adoption can happen.

From the technical side, aeronautical engineers will need to take the technologies developed in the automotive and space industries and make the technology compatible with commercial aircraft operations, notably by bringing the weight and cost down. One specific challenge is how to store hydrogen on board the aircraft. Today, liquid hydrogen storage is among the most promising options, while storing hydrogen as compressed gas poses challenges with current aircraft weight and volume requirements.

In addition, the aviation industry will need to achieve the same or better safety targets than what has been achieved with existing commercial aircraft. Indeed, extensive safety precautions are currently taken into account in the design and operation of today’s kerosene-powered aircraft. This stringent approach has ensured the industry’s consistent safety record throughout the years. Future hydrogen-propulsion systems will thus need to achieve equivalent or better safety levels before hydrogen-powered aircraft can take to the skies.

Cost-competitive green hydrogen and cross-industry partnerships will be mandatory to bring zero emission flying to reality.

- Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus VP, Zero-Emission Aircraft

On the road towards green hydrogen

Another key challenge for widespread adoption is liquid hydrogen availability and cost at airports. Hydrogen is available in vast quantities in oceans, lakes and the atmosphere, however, it must be separated from oxygen in water in order to be used for industrial purposes.

Today, more than 70 million tonnes of hydrogen are produced every year, the primary extraction source of which is natural gas (i.e. grey hydrogen). When extracted via fossil fuels, hydrogen production is energy-intensive, responsible for around 830 million tonnes of CO2 emissions per year. However, electrolysers, powered by electricity generated from renewables, offer a low-emission alternative. This process, resulting in “green hydrogen,” involves water electrolysis to extract hydrogen.

Less than 0.1% of global dedicated hydrogen production today is considered green hydrogen but that could change. Between 2014 and 2019, global wind electricity production doubled while global solar electricity production quadrupled. The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts the rapid market growth of renewables, particularly solar and wind, over the next decade will exponentially increase the availability of renewable electricity, thereby driving down its cost. And demand for electrolysers capable of producing green hydrogen is already growing rapidly with an expected electrolyser capacity of 40 GW in the EU by 2030. The increased availability of green hydrogen will thus help to decrease its cost by as much as 30% by 2030 and 50% by 2050.

This 2030 timeline is in line with Airbus’ anticipated delivery of its ZEROe programme. Indeed, according to Glenn Llewellyn, VP of Zero-Emission Aircraft, Airbus is targeting the use of green hydrogen to fuel its future zero-emission aircraft. He believes declining costs for renewable energy and the scaling up of hydrogen production could make green hydrogen increasingly cost-competitive with existing options, such as jet fuel and sustainable aviation fuels.

“Cost-competitive green hydrogen and cross-industry partnerships will be mandatory to bring zero-emission flying to reality,” he says.

Ensuring hydrogen availability at airports worldwide

But for hydrogen to really achieve widespread adoption across the aviation industry, it must be made available at airports worldwide.

And advancement in this area is in its infancy. One main challenge is developing the large-scale transport and infrastructure solutions required to supply airports with the necessary quantities of hydrogen needed to fuel aircraft.

A recent IEA study suggests that repurposing existing infrastructure, including the millions of kilometers of pipelines used today to transport natural gas, could be a cost-effective solution. Larger quantities of hydrogen could thus be transported via pipeline from production sites, while smaller quantities could be transported by truck. In addition, some airport locations could develop the necessary infrastructure to support on-site hydrogen production, particularly if a renewable energy supply is within close proximity.

Airbus is currently collaborating with both airports and airlines to ensure the necessary hydrogen infrastructure is in place. This includes research into how all airport-associated ground transport (i.e. cargo trucks, passenger buses, aircraft tugs, etc.) could be decarbonised throughout the 2020s timeframe using a stepped approach, which is expected to pave the way to hydrogen availability for aircraft over the 2030s timeframe.

Changing public perceptions about hydrogen

For over 40 years, hydrogen has been safely used in vast quantities as an industrial chemical and as fuel for space exploration. In fact, several million cubic meters of hydrogen are transported and handled every year. However, public perception on hydrogen’s safety is still mixed: only 49.5% of respondents to a recent survey believed that hydrogen is “generally safe.” Throughout the years, this perception has undoubtedly been negatively shaped by incidents like the 1937 Hindenburg disaster.

However, what is interesting about the survey is that 73.2% of participants responded favourably to the second question about “willingness to use hydrogen-powered modes of transportation.” As hydrogen increasingly becomes a mainstay in the development of new transport solutions like cars and buses, public perceptions on hydrogen are likely to change–which should positively influence hydrogen adoption in aircraft.

The road to widespread hydrogen adoption in aviation is still long. But international coordination across industries is expected to support the development of the hydrogen economy–an important endeavour to help meet ambitious global decarbonisation targets over the next two decades."
Why does every Airbus aircraft start with a 3? - AeroTime,"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMjMwNDEtYWlyYnVzLW5hbWUtc3RhcnQtd2l0aC0z0gFFaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWVyb3RpbWUuYWVyby9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMzA0MS1haXJidXMtbmFtZS1zdGFydC13aXRoLTMvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The confetti was just cleaned up after the whole aviation community celebrated the 50th anniversary of Airbus less than a week ago. Exactly 50 years ago the story of a European multinational company started, when France and West Germany signed a document, affirming their commitment to the Airbus A300 program. The company officially took off on the 29th of May, 1969.

Along with the company, so did the tradition of naming Airbus aircraft in a certain way took off. That begs the question – why does every Airbus aircraft start with the number 3?

Starting from the Airbus A300

We all know how Boeing started naming their aircraft with the number 7, a combination that has remained relevant to this day. Every time you hear an aircraft starting with a 7 and ending with a 7, you know it’s a Boeing. Nevertheless, when Airbus announced its first passenger aircraft, it was met with quite a lot of skepticism. The A300 was unique at the time – no other wide-body aircraft had two engines. During the 70s, there were three wide-body aircraft, namely the Boeing 747, the DC-10 and the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar. The 747 had four engines, while the DC-10 and the L-1011 had three engines.

Airbus had a simple reason why they named their first jet the A300 – it carried 300 passengers. The A stands for Airbus!

Anyways, the manufacturer presented the Airbus A300B1 with the following specifications:

300 passengers

2 General Electric (GE) CF6-50A high-bypass turbofan engines

Maximum Take-Off Weight of 132,000 kilograms (291,010 lbs)

However, Airbus built only 2 A300B1 airframes. This was because the company further studied the aviation market at the time and realized that no airline would order a passenger jet with 300 aircraft, thus they reduced the maximum passenger count to 250. But the name A300 stuck, not to confuse potential customers. As time went on and the freshly-started aircraft manufacturer introduced new models, namely the smaller A310, it wanted to keep the naming cohesion and dubbed it the A310.

Skipping the A360 and the A370

The same cohesion followed through Airbus’ family of aircraft.

After the company unveiled the A310 and now-bankrupt Swissair introduced it to the world in 1983, Airbus subsequently named the next aircraft the A320, the A330, A340 and the A350. But it had skipped the Airbus A360 and the A370 and went straight to the Airbus A380 name. Why Airbus doesn‘t have an A360 and A370 model?

It could be because of the sheer size of the A380. Due to the fact that it is that much bigger than the A350, Airbus still has the option to build aircraft between the A350 and the A380 in regards to their size and passenger capacity. It‘s no secret that eventually the company will have to introduce new aircraft to replace their A320 or A330s, even if they are fairly new because of the neo (new engine option) upgrade.

While Boeing is running out of 7×7 format names, as they only have the 797 left. But aviation journalists have already reported that the 797 name will go to Boeing’s newest aircraft, currently officially called the NMA. As a result, Boeing will have no remaining 7×7 names left. Airbus still has that flexibility, because the A360, A370 and the A390 are still free.

Additionally, the Toulouse-based manufacturer has ventured into the A2XX name format with the former-Bombardier CSeries aircraft. While there is no official reason why the A220 starts with a 2, people have speculated that because the jet is smaller than any Airbus aircraft. One more theory is that because the planemaker didn’t originally design and manufacture the CSeries, so it is not named using the 3XX format. So, the next time someone asks the question of why Airbus aircraft start with a 3, the answer is simple – it’s because its first aircraft, the A300, could potentially fit 300 passengers. In order to keep the strength of the brand, every aircraft after the A300 also used the A3XX format."
Southwest Airlines is looking at Airbus planes as Boeing 737 Max alternative - The Dallas Morning News,"Fri, 23 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9haXJsaW5lcy8yMDIwLzEwLzIzL3NvdXRod2VzdC1haXJsaW5lcy1pcy1sb29raW5nLWF0LWFpcmJ1cy1wbGFuZXMtYXMtYm9laW5nLTczNy1tYXgtYWx0ZXJuYXRpdmUv0gGUAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2FpcmxpbmVzLzIwMjAvMTAvMjMvc291dGh3ZXN0LWFpcmxpbmVzLWlzLWxvb2tpbmctYXQtYWlyYnVzLXBsYW5lcy1hcy1ib2VpbmctNzM3LW1heC1hbHRlcm5hdGl2ZS8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Southwest Airlines will consider adding jets from European aircraft manufacturer Airbus to its all-Boeing fleet as the grounded 737 Max moves closer to recertification.

Dallas-based Southwest, which has flown Boeing’s single-aisle 737 jets for nearly all of its history, said in a call with investors Thursday that it is looking into an alternative aircraft and Airbus A220 jets may fit its needs.

The A220 is Airbus' smaller jet that can hold 100 to 150 seats, depending on the configuration, and has a range of about 3,900 miles, roughly the same as Boeing’s 737 Max. Delta made a big bet on the A220-300, ordering 95 jets, and it is getting the first one delivered this week from Airbus’ factory in Mobile, Ala.

Southwest has been looking into an alternative to the 737 Max after the plane was grounded in March 2019 following deadly crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia that killed 346 people. CEO Gary Kelly has said the company will consider planes from Boeing and others.

The A220 is on the shortlist, Southwest chief operating officer Mike Van de Ven said.

“The A220 and the MAX 7, they’re the two players in the marketplace and both of those airplanes have their strengths and their disadvantages,” Van de Ven said during Thursday’s call with investors. “And we’ve been looking at both airplanes. We will continue that evaluation.”

The COVID-19 pandemic has decreased the need for more airplanes, but it’s also given the company time to think about diversifying its fleet.

“So the only thing that I would willingly admit is that if there were ever a scenario for us to consider making a change in aircraft type, it would be now because we are not desperate to grow the airline and may not be for a long time,” Kelly said.

Southwest has long touted that its single fleet type of 737s gives it a competitive advantage over other airlines because the planes are interchangeable across the fleet. Crew members, passengers and mechanics can jump between planes.

“We have a ton of 737-700s that are coming up for retirement over the next five to 10 years,” Kelly said. “And we will absolutely want to replace them, but we’re certainly not thinking that we want all 175-seaters.”

The A220 has been a popular talking point in the airline industry because its smaller size could give carriers the ability to serve smaller communities. The plane was originally a partnership between Airbus, Bombardier and the Quebec, Canada, government. But since then, Airbus has taken a larger stake in the jet and is producing a new line out of Alabama.

Chief financial officer Tammy Romo said there are advantages to the single-type fleet, but smaller jets like the A220 have their advantages, too.

“We have long been an all-Boeing carrier and there are certainly efficiencies that come with that,” she said. “All that gets factored into our valuation, but a smaller gauge aircraft like the 220 or MAX 7 certainly are aircraft that we will need to fly those shorter- to medium-haul markets.”

The convenience of a single fleet type was severely challenged in March 2019, when the Federal Aviation Administration and global regulators grounded the 737 Max because of a faulty software system meant to help stabilize the plane that contributed to those two crashes. Boeing and the FAA, both under extreme pressure to get the plane fixed safely, are still working on fixes and the aircraft is expected to be recertified and ready to fly again sometime around the end of 2020.

The grounding forced Southwest, the largest global owner of the 737 Max with 34 jets and dozens more set for delivery, to cancel thousands of flights. Because all of Southwest’s new plane orders were for the 737 Max model, it severely restricted the airline’s ability to grow during one of the best years in global aviation history.

Southwest promised to look at an alternative to the Max, but wanted to wait until the plane was recertified to fly. That was nearly 20 months ago.

Southwest has hundreds of 737 Max jets on order with Boeing and has negotiated a deal to delay many of those deliveries during the next two years.

“Our interim agreement with Boeing from earlier this year is that we will take no more than 48 aircraft through the end of 2021,” Romo said. “The environment has not improved since then, and it’s certainly safe to say that we do not need 48 aircraft next year.”

While the pandemic has given Southwest time to look at new planes, it’s also given it time to delay committing to a new jet.

“We don’t really need to make those decisions until probably 2025 and beyond,” Van de Ven said. “So today, we’re just really focused on the Max, getting the Max back into service, making sure that we have the right delivery schedule with Boeing.”"
Airbus to operate drones searching for migrants crossing the Mediterranean - The Guardian,"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIwL29jdC8yMC9haXJidXMtdG8tb3BlcmF0ZS1kcm9uZXMtc2VhcmNoaW5nLWZvci1taWdyYW50cy1jcm9zc2luZy10aGUtbWVkaXRlcnJhbmVhbtIBe2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIwL29jdC8yMC9haXJidXMtdG8tb3BlcmF0ZS1kcm9uZXMtc2VhcmNoaW5nLWZvci1taWdyYW50cy1jcm9zc2luZy10aGUtbWVkaXRlcnJhbmVhbg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus and two Israeli arms companies will be paid €100m (£91m) to operate unmanned drones to spot refugees and migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean sea to Europe, according to EU contracts.

Drone operations over the Mediterranean will start next year, after testing carried out on the Greek island of Crete.

Airbus, the European aerospace and defence conglomerate, will work with state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) to operate the medium-altitude long-endurance, remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) – known as drones – for “maritime aerial surveillance services”.

As well as the Airbus/IAI contract for €50m, the EU has awarded Elbit Systems, a private Israeli weapons manufacturer, a separate contract worth €50m for identical services.

The EU has spent increasing amounts of money on policing its borders after the number of refugees and migrants trying to enter Europe rose in 2015, putting putting pressure on the governments of member states.

The political backlash prompted a major increase in spending on measures to police Europe’s southern borders. The budget of the agency responsible, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency – also known as Frontex – increased from just €6m in 2005 to €142m in 2015, before surging to €460m this year.

The Observer reported last year that Warsaw-based Frontex was preparing to use drones. The revelation prompted criticism that the unmanned aerial vehicles could allow the EU to avoid its legal responsibility to save the lives of people in distress at sea.

The drones will be based in either Greece, Italy or Malta. The companies will provide the equipment as well as human operators to control the drones via radio and satellite links.

IAI claims its Heron drone is capable of flying for over 24 hours, and can range up to 1,000 miles from its base at altitudes of more than 35,000 feet. It has been used extensively by the Israeli and German armed forces. Airbus said the model is not capable of carrying weapons, and will be painted white with Frontex labelling.

Elbit Systems claims its Hermes drones can fly for up to 36 hours at up to 30,000 feet. Last month, Elbit announced that Hermes drones had been tested with the UK’s Maritime and Coastguard Agency off the west coast of Wales for search and rescue operations.

Airbus and IAI said they hoped the contract would open the door for the use of drones in other civilian contexts.

Moshe Levy, IAI’s general manager of the military aircraft group, said: “Flying in Europe’s civilian airspace is important progress for IAI and a solid proof for the RPAS’s ability to fly in civilian routes. I believe this contract will open the door to more civilian markets.”"

Airbus Hopes to Be Flying Hydrogen-Powered Jetliners With Zero Carbon Emissions by 2035 - InsideClimate News,"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlY2xpbWF0ZW5ld3Mub3JnL25ld3MvMjcxMDIwMjAvaHlkcm9nZW4tZnVlbGVkLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWNsZWFuLWVuZXJneS1lbWlzc2lvbnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The aerospace giant Airbus hopes to put a hydrogen-powered commercial airliner in the sky that will release zero carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere. But not until 2035.

While 15 years might seem like a long time for research and development given the urgent need to reduce carbon emissions under the Paris climate agreement, processing and storing “clean hydrogen” requires solving an array of complex technical challenges. Three early design concepts the company is studying would run off of hydrogen and oxygen fuel and have no carbon exhaust. But that doesn’t mean they won’t affect the climate at all.

“I will let you in on a little secret, they are not zero emission,” Amanda Simpson, vice president for research and technology for Airbus Americas, said.

Burning hydrogen produces water, which comes out of the engines as a vapor that, especially at high altitudes, acts as a greenhouse gas.

Recent studies have shown that contrails—the white streaks of condensed water that follow jets across the sky—have a significant climate impact. Still, these hydrogen-powered designs could significantly limit the total warming that airlines cause by reducing or eliminating the carbon dioxide they emit. Airlines accounted for more than 2 percent of global CO2 emissions in 2018, with the total contribution of contrails and the various pollutants from commercial aviation driving about 5 percent of warming globally.

Up to this point, industry attempts at zero carbon flight have been smaller proof-of-concept designs, like short range electric planes that don’t scale up practically for larger passenger flights.

Simpson said she thinks hydrogen power is going to be “as clean as we can get,” so the development of a plane that runs on it is an important step in decarbonizing the aerospace industry.

Ilan Kroo, a professor of aeronautics and astronautics at Stanford University, said there’s no guarantee that Airbus can meet their self-imposed deadline of 2035, because there are many uncertainties along the road to developing hydrogen-powered planes. No one knows what problems will arise or what breakthroughs may occur over the next 15 years.

“I think it’s great that they’re hoping to do that,” he said.

Annie Petsonk, international counsel for the Earth Defense Fund, said she thinks it’s crucial that Airbus is “giving engineers a goal and a commitment.” For these technologies to progress, she said, companies and policymakers need to set targets, then solve the technological hurdles to meet them, rather than the other way around.

Creating Demand for Hydrogen-Powered Flight

Airbus has previously made public forays into zero carbon flight, beginning with a small electric aircraft unveiled in 2010. The company’s main competitor, Boeing, tested a small hydrogen powered aircraft in 2008—the first manned flight of its kind—and test flew a hydrogen drone in 2012, but hasn’t announced plans for hydrogen-powered passenger flights.

In fact, Boeing’s top product developer, Michael Sinnett, recently expressed skepticism at the possibility of hydrogen-powered passenger flights in the near future. Sinnett said that the new hydrogen technologies would take a long time to develop and that government regulations might not be quick to accommodate them, once they arrived. He also said that to maintain aircraft safety standards, the industry still has a lot to learn about hydrogen.

The hydrogen on the market today, said Simpson, of Airbus Americas, is “brown,” meaning that it is not a sustainably-produced energy source. Ninety-five percent of hydrogen produced in the United States comes from natural gas “reforming,” an energy intensive process that converts methane into hydrogen and other gases. Currently, the vast majority of domestic natural gas comes from hydraulic fracturing.

But in creating a demand for clean hydrogen, Simpson said, Airbus anticipates that fuel suppliers will upgrade their production of the element by splitting water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen using renewable electricity.

“If demand is going to support them,” Simpson said of hydrogen-powered airliners, “we think they will become economical and they will be very clean.”

Airbus plans to have several hydrogen-powered planes flying by the mid-2030s, Simpson said, and from there the company will gradually grow its fleet.

Over the next five years, Airbus will do intensive research and development for its hydrogen concepts, Simpson said. They presented preliminary designs in an announcement last month: one for a passenger jet and another for a smaller capacity “turboprop ”plane driven by a turbine combined with a propeller. Both these designs resemble conventional passenger aircraft, but Airbus has also conceived of a wide “blended-wing body,” that would have a similar range and passenger count as the jet, but that looks more like a stealth bomber.

The larger designs would seat 200 passengers and have a range of 2,000 nautical miles, while the turboprop would seat 120 and have a range of 1,000 miles. They would burn hydrogen and oxygen and draw additional power from hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells—devices which, rather than burning the elements, combine them to produce electricity, like a battery that, instead of being recharged, is refilled with the elements that react to create electricity. The fuel cells would provide an extra boost through an electric engine.

These concepts are early, and Airbus may end up developing more than one of the three concept planes or coming up with an entirely new concept by the end of the five years. “One? Two? All three? Something different?” Simpson said.

The final design will depend on input from airlines and, in turn, passengers’ interest in low-carbon flight, she said.

The five year research and development period will be followed by one to two years of “industrializing”—figuring out how they would design, build and upscale the aircraft. They would expect the first flight after four or five more years, and then would begin testing the aircraft to ensure it meets international aviation standards. Certifying the aircraft will inherently be more difficult, because of the novelty of its hydrogen-adapted components.

Finding Room for Fuel

Fuel storage is a major technical hurdle for hydrogen aircraft. Gaseous hydrogen fuel would weigh less than conventional fuels with the same amount of energy, but take up more space, Kroo said.

This would require aircraft designers to either find a way to safely and efficiently store liquid hydrogen, which is much more compact than the gaseous form, or find more room onboard the aircraft for fuel storage.

Whether aircraft will be able to store liquid hydrogen is a current debate, Kroo said. The fuel used in many rockets, liquid hydrogen would require heavy, high-pressure storage tanks kept at ultra-low temperatures. If designers can make these tanks light, cool and safe, they could pack a lot of energy into a small space.

Otherwise, they’ll have to find more space in the aircraft for gaseous hydrogen. One advantage of the “blended-wing body” design, according to Kroo, is that it could create more internal space for fuel storage.

In addition to the water vapor that forms contrails, the hot turbines, like those in current aircraft, will fuse together nitrogen oxides from the nitrogen and oxygen in the air, but hydrogen turbines would produce considerably fewer than conventionally fueled ones, Kroo said. Nitrogen oxides create ozone. In the stratosphere the ozone layer blocks ultraviolet light that can burn skin and plants, but at high elevations in the troposphere, the layer of the atmosphere closest to the Earth, ozone and water vapor can act as greenhouse gases.

“In general, hydrogen [fueling an aircraft] at altitudes below 11 or 12 kilometers, has substantially lower greenhouse gases,” than an aircraft that uses conventional jet fuel, Kroo said. To limit the climate impact of nitrogen oxides and vapor trails, he said, airlines should avoid pushing the cruising altitudes of their passenger jets higher than that, which would exacerbate the climate-warming effects of both.

Flying higher is generally appealing for airlines because the thinner air causes less drag and allows for more efficient flights. Some studies have shown that flying at lower altitudes can significantly reduce production of nitrogen oxides. Others have shown that altering flight routes to avoid forming contrails could reduce their warming impact by roughly 50 to 60 percent. He also noted that an electric-only hydrogen fuel cell-powered plane could avoid the water vapor problem entirely, by trapping the water formed in the process inside the plane.

As for shorter term sustainability measures, Airbus is looking at using synthetic fuels that can be produced by combining hydrogen and carbon dioxide captured from the air to replace conventional ones, namely, kerosene, which are refined from oil. These fuels can be used in current aircraft as an “intermediate step” before the hydrogen-fueled planes come on to the market.

“Synthetic fuels are indeed a way to decarbonize, but it’s not zero emission,” Simpson said. At present, the aviation industry depends on long-range, high-occupancy aircraft. These early hydrogen designs can’t fill that role, and neither can shorter-range electric planes, Simpson said. “So synthetic fuels are going to have to be part of the solution to decarbonize aviation.”

The switch to hydrogen, she said, will not happen overnight. More than 20,000 airliners are in service today, and that number is expected to jump to between 30,000 and 40,000 by 2030.

“There’s gonna be kerosene…in use for a long, long time,” she said. Still, she is confident that green hydrogen fuels will be available in the not too distant future and engines that run on it will eventually be developed.

“Hydrogen is coming,” she said. “We’re just going to be adding to the demand.”

Airbus Helicopters

Airbus Helicopters is the rotorcraft wing of Airbus, Europe's largest aerospace and defense conglomerate. The company was founded in 1992 as Eurocopter Group, after a merger between the helicopter divisions of Aérospatiale and DaimlerChrysler Aerospace (DASA).

Airbus Helicopters has been a pioneer in rotorcraft development for decades. Legacy company Aérospatiale developed the world's first turboshaft-powered helicopter in 1955, the Alouette II, as well as the ""Fenestron"" shrouded tail rotor design, which debuted on the Gazelle in 1968. In both civil and military applications, Airbus helicopters have proven to be best sellers with a reputation for ruggedness and durability. They sport features such as full flight capabilities in icing conditions and fly-by-light digital flight controls. Airbus helicopter variants have also accomplished high-profile feats never attempted by other rotorcraft, such as the 2005 landing of an AS350 B3 at the peak of Mt. Everest.

Eurocopter was officially rebranded as Airbus Helicopters in 2014, after 22 years of operation as Eurocopter SA and Eurocopter SAS. Rotorcraft names were changed across the board, with each receiving a new numerical designation with an ""H"" prefix.

The Airbus Helicopters product line includes entries in the intermediate-single segment (H125 and H130), light-twin segment (H135, H145), medium and super-medium segments (H155, H160, H175), and heavy segment (H215, H225). In 2017, Airbus Helicopters announced the launch of the Airbus Corporate Helicopters (ACH) business unit, a luxury corporate helicopter development wing mirrored after the successful Airbus Corporate Jet (ACJ) model. ACH offers up-market VIP variants of the H125, H130, H135, H145, H160, and H175, positioning an offering in every segment from intermediate single to super-medium. Cabin configurations and design characteristics are customizable to consumer preference, and most feature extended ranges over their base-model counterparts.

Airbus Helicopters employs roughly 20,000 people worldwide and is headquartered at the Marseille Provence Airport in Marignane, France."
"Hydrogen fuel cells, explained - Airbus","Thu, 15 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIwLTEwLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLWZ1ZWwtY2VsbHMtZXhwbGFpbmVk0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hydrogen fuel cells are emerging as a high-potential technology that offers significant energy efficiency and decarbonisation benefits to a range of industries—including automotive and heavy transport. In a strategic partnership with automotive systems supplier ElringKlinger, Airbus is investing to mature fuel cell propulsion systems for the aviation market.

In 1838, judge-turned-scientist Sir William Grove came up with a novel idea: to construct a cell consisting of two separate sealed compartments, each of which was fed by either hydrogen or oxygen gas. At the time, he called his invention a “gas voltaic battery.” Unfortunately, it did not produce enough electricity to be of much use. It remained a scientific curiosity until the 20th century, when English engineer Francis Thomas Bacon matured the original idea to develop the world’s very first hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell in 1932.

Bacon’s fuel cell was such a success that it has been used by the space industry to power satellites and rockets for space exploration programmes, including Apollo 11, since the 1960s. As the story goes, then-US President Richard Nixon famously said: ""Without you Tom, we wouldn't have gotten to the moon.”

Today, hydrogen fuel cell technology is being used for a variety of applications, including to:

provide emergency backup power to critical facilities like hospitals

replace grid electricity for critical-load facilities like data centres

power a variety of transportation modes such as cars, buses, trains and forklifts.

Tomorrow, it could potentially power everything from low-carbon cities and regions to portable computing devices to future zero-emission aircraft.

Hydrogen fuel cells: how do they work?

Similar to batteries, a fuel cell is a device that converts energy stored in molecules into electricity through an electrochemical reaction. Composed of two electrodes (an anode and a cathode) separated by an electrolyte membrane, a typical hydrogen fuel cell works in the following way:

Hydrogen enters the fuel cell via the anode. Here, hydrogen atoms react with a catalyst and split into electrons and protons. Oxygen from the ambient air enters on the other side through the cathode.

The positively charged protons pass through the porous electrolyte membrane to the cathode. The negatively charged electrons flow out of the cell and generate an electric current, which can be used, for example, to power an electric or hybrid-electric propulsion system.

In the cathode, the protons and oxygen then combine to produce water.

A PEM, Proton Exchange Membrane cell uses hydrogen gas and oxygen gas as fuel.

Today, Airbus has significant know-how in electric propulsion and fuel cells thanks to work carried out at our E-Aircraft System House and currently taking place at the ZAL in Hamburg. This partnership will be a phenomenal acceleration in bringing hydrogen fuel cells to future aircraft.

Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus VP of Zero-Emission Aircraft

Because fuel cells generate electricity through an electrochemical reaction, they are a clean source of power. In fact, fuel cells that use pure hydrogen are carbon-free. Some other key advantages of fuel cells include the following:

Unlike batteries that need to be recharged, fuel cells can continue to generate electricity as long as a fuel source (hydrogen) is provided.

Individual fuel cells can be “stacked” to form larger systems capable of producing more power, thereby allowing scalability. A single fuel cell can produce enough voltage to power small applications, while fuel cell stacks can be combined to create large-scale, multi-megawatt installations.

Because there are no moving parts, fuel cells are silent and highly reliable.

A strategic partnership to increase cross-industry collaboration

Over the last two decades, the automotive and space industries have been at the forefront of maturing hydrogen fuel cell technology. For example, fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) have gone through several stages of development to prove their efficiency, safety and reliability, offering the exciting potential for longer range, larger carrying capacity, and faster refuelling times than traditional electric vehicles. And hydrogen fuel cells have been used by the space industry to power auxiliary electric systems on board spacecraft for years. This same technology is now inspiring aeronautical engineers to consider new ways to power electrical systems on board future aircraft.

In fact, Airbus’ ZEROe concept aircraft is expected to use hydrogen fuel cells to create electrical power that complements the modified gas-turbine engines, resulting in a highly efficient hybrid-electric propulsion system. To further explore the possibilities of fuel cell propulsion systems for aviation, Airbus has entered into a strategic partnership* with ElringKlinger, a company with over 20 years of experience as both a fuel cell system and component supplier.

“This partnership will contribute to growing our in-house expertise in alternative-propulsion systems,” says Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus VP of Zero-Emission Aircraft. “Today, Airbus has significant know-how in electric propulsion and fuel cells thanks to work carried out at our E-Aircraft System House and currently taking place at the ZAL in Hamburg. This partnership will be a phenomenal acceleration in bringing hydrogen fuel cells to future aircraft.”

The agreement involves co-developing and co-validating aviation-compatible fuel cell stacks. In particular, testing the power density of fuel cell stacks for aircraft will be a key focus area.

“Battery-powered propulsion to fuel larger aircraft over longer distances is not possible with today’s technology,” explains Matthieu Thomas, ZEROe Aircraft Lead Architect. “Hydrogen fuel cells could be a great alternative because they can generate—with zero emissions—significantly more power and energy for a given weight. This makes fuel cells an extremely interesting technology to achieve our ambitions.”

While hydrogen fuel cell technology to power alternative-propulsion systems is still new to aviation, cross-industry collaboration, like the strategic partnership between Airbus and ElringKlinger, will be essential to maturing the technology’s potential in the years to come.

Successful partnership between Airbus Defence and Space Airborne Solutions (ADAS) and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI).

Contract highlights the huge benefits of unmanned aerial systems in terms of precise and long endurance surveillance.

Bremen, 20th October 2020 - The European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) awarded a contract to Airbus Defence and Space Airborne Solutions (ADAS), a 100% subsidiary of Airbus Defence and Space and the global market leader in RPAS services, and its long-term partner Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) to operate a Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) RPAS for Maritime Aerial Surveillance services.

The service will be delivered in Greece, and/or Italy and/or Malta within a Framework Contract. The service include the provision of a RPAS platform, payload, communication equipment and capacity, mission storage and all necessary experts managing the system and providing operational support. Under the contract, Airbus and IAI will provide the service for pre-planned assignments as well as for ad-hoc calls.

The maritime Heron RPAS from IAI serves a range of customers worldwide and is a part of the well-known ""Heron family” which accumulates over 450,000 flight hours, day and night missions under all weather conditions. The system is capable of flying more than 24 hours in full operational configuration and creates a comprehensive, real time, naval picture in geographical areas for potential surveillance interests, e.g. in the context of coordinated European monitoring activities.

The RPAS will be fitted with versatile dedicated payloads (e.g. electro-optical for day and infrared for night purposes, maritime patrol radar made by IAI and automatic identification system), relevant communication equipment, and corresponding ground mission control and support. The surveillance platform Heron uses a direct link when flying within Line of Sight (LOS), changing seamlessly to a satellite link when flying Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) to transmit real time information or when needed to fly in low altitude over sea. This information is being transmitted to Frontex command and control centre as well as to centres of the respective Coast Guards.

Numerous trials were successfully held over the past years to confirm and highlight the benefits of unmanned aerial systems in terms of precise and long endurance surveillance. The maritime Heron is being used amongst others by the Israeli navy as its key patrolling tool, successfully performing reconnaissance and security assignments since many years.

Mike Hoofdmann, CEO of ADAS underlined that this contract for long endurance maritime surveillance for Frontex marks a new milestone for the company to extend its successful unmanned operational services for military customers also to civil stakeholders such as Frontex and eventually other agencies. “This contract gives us the opportunity to prove our performance on a European level. We as Airbus together with our partner IAI make an essential commitment to the monitoring and security of European external border and thus contribute to the stability in Europe”, adds Hoofdmann.

""IAI welcomes the signing of the contract with Frontex and achieving this landmark with the maritime Heron. The Heron has successfully fulfilled all missions, exceeding the expectations of its operators. Flying in Europe’s civilian airspace is an important progress for IAI and a solid proof for the RPAS’s ability to fly in civilian routes. I believe this contract will open the door to more civilian markets"" said IAI Executive Vice President and General Manager of the Military Aircraft Group, Moshe Levy.

ROXY turns Moon dust into oxygen - Airbus,"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMC0xMC1yb3h5LXR1cm5zLW1vb24tZHVzdC1pbnRvLW94eWdlbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"New technology from Airbus achieves breakthrough

Chemical reduction process opens new horizons in human space exploration

Emission-free method could also contribute to UN sustainability goals on Earth

Friedrichshafen/Dresden/Boston/Seville, 27 October 2020 – An international team led by Airbus Defence and Space (Friedrichshafen, Germany) with scientists from Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Technology and Advanced Materials IFAM (Dresden, Germany), Boston University (Massachusetts, USA) and Abengoa Innovación (Seville, Spain) has successfully demonstrated the production of oxygen and metals from simulated lunar dust (regolith) with the Airbus-invented process named ROXY (Regolith to OXYgen and Metals Conversion). Airbus believes ROXY could revolutionise human space exploration.

After two years’ development the breakthrough came last month, during a series of laboratory tests at Fraunhofer IFAM. Oxygen was extracted from a sample of simulated lunar dust. This is a small first step, but the way towards an operational system is now clear. Oxygen is indispensable for all human space activities, and this new ROXY production method, which directly uses Moon dust could revolutionise human activities on the lunar surface.



“This breakthrough is a massive leap forward – taking us one step closer to the holy grail of being able to sustain long term living on the Moon,” said Jean-Marc Nasr, Head of Space Systems at Airbus. ”ROXY is proof positive that collaboration between industry and world leading scientists can bring huge tangible benefits that will continue to push the boundaries of future exploration.”



ROXY enables the design of a small, simple, compact and cost-efficient regolith to oxygen and metals conversion facility, and is therefore ideally suited to support a wide range of future exploration missions. Not requiring additional materials or consumables from Earth – except the ROXY reactor itself – this could be the heart of an integrated value chain using additive layer manufacturing to produce a wide range of products ‘Made on the Moon’. These could include metals, alloys and oxygen. Combined with lunar ice, it would even be possible to produce rocket fuel from ROXY metal powder.



On Earth, ROXY opens a new pathway to drastically reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases that result from production of metals. With current technologies, global metal production causes severe environmental impacts. Steelmaking accounts for about 5 percent of the total global CO 2 emissions. Many metals are obtained with processes that emit significant amounts of the environmentally harmful perfluorocarbons (PFCs). Since ROXY is essentially an emission-free process these environmental impacts could be reduced, providing a significant contribution to the UN sustainability goals – another example of how space technologies can improve life on Earth.



Note to the editors – Further statements

Fraunhofer



“The project has impressively shown that cooperation between research and industry can take on completely new dimensions, especially if one looks and works beyond the familiar horizon,” said Dr.-Ing. Peter Quadbeck, Group Manager Metal Hollow Spheres and Open-Cell Structures and project manager of ROXY at Fraunhofer IFAM.

Abengoa



“It has been a great opportunity to bring Abengoa's energy background and industrial experience to help develop clean metal production processes. It enables the development of exciting technologies for space exploration and in-situ resource utilization; setting the ground for integration with renewable energy production options to minimize their environmental footprint and increase their efficiency,”said Sonia de la Rosa, Head of the Aerospace Division of Abengoa.

Boston University



“It was gratifying to be part of the team that designed the inert anode and selected the materials for the reactor,” said Boston University Engineering Professor Uday Pal. “I look forward to continuing work on the next generation of the ROXY reactor and contributing to designing an exciting, advanced Green process.”

Manned-Unmanned Teaming and Remote Carriers: transcending individual assets' capabilities - Airbus,"Thu, 08 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIwLTEwLW1hbm5lZC11bm1hbm5lZC10ZWFtaW5nLWFuZC1yZW1vdGUtY2FycmllcnMtdHJhbnNjZW5kaW5nLWluZGl2aWR1YWwtYXNzZXRz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When discussing the Future Combat Air System (FCAS), it is often too easy to equate such an innovative concept to the New Generation Fighter (NGF). As mentioned in previous articles, FCAS is a complete combat System of Systems leveraging the collaborative capabilities of connected assets. In this article, we will reflect on some of its key components.

Western air forces, even the most modern ones, are facing two major trends. The rise of Integrated Air Defence Systems (IADS) is leading to more complex and challenging operational environments and at the same time we have seen a decline in the numbers of increasingly sophisticated Western combat aircraft, meaning fewer assets are available for operational duty. When both trends combined, Western air forces are at risk of not being able to field sufficient combat mass to defeat an adversary’s IADS. Teaming of manned combat aircraft with unmanned systems is one way of addressing this situation, whilst bringing the additional benefit of reducing the risk to the pilots. To effectively orchestrate the use of these assets, there is a strong push for Manned-Unmanned Teaming technologies, a field in which Airbus holds a leading position.

Combat missions are primary intended use of Manned-Unmanned Teaming. Purposely designed and built, yet modular, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) known as Remote Carriers (RCs), will team with tomorrow’s NGF and even upgraded in‑service jets such as the Eurofighter. With packs of RCs teaming with combat aircraft, we will provide the augmented combat mass needed in highly contested environments. This will be achieved in a flexible manner depending on the scenario, given the incremental nature of capabilities provided by RCs. An increase in effectiveness will be achieved by opening new fields of tactics based on collaborative combat and the use of deception and numerical superiority to disrupt and overwhelm the opponent. Efficiency will be improved by ensuring that the required mix of capabilities for a given mission is available. Manned assets can remain at a safer distance, whilst closer RCs will deal with the threats, thus keeping the pilots out of harm’s way and increasing the manned platforms’ survivability.

RCs will act as both remote sensors and effectors, due to their ability to carry a wide range of payloads. These will include Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) equipment as well as kinetic and non-kinetic effectors. RCs will therefore support and perform a wide variety of missions including Air-to-Air Combat, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance, Airborne Electronic Attack or Strike. In a flexible manner, the right assets will be chosen and configured according to the task at hand.

To provide these ground-breaking capabilities, Airbus is taking an innovative approach when designing RCs. They will be a family of air vehicles, with sizes ranging from several hundred kilograms, for expendable ones, to several tons, for the more sophisticated loyal wingman type. Airbus, together with its industrial partners, is currently analysing this spectrum within the FCAS Joint Concept Study to determine the most suitable designs, which will be further developed into the Next Generation Weapon System. All RCs will follow the overarching rule of increased commonality and modularity to achieve maximum cost effectiveness.

The below video highlights how RCs teaming with manned assets will play a key role in scenarios where a highly contested environment must be penetrated. Notice how the RCs are used for a variety of roles, acting as force multipliers for the fighter aircraft.

For decades, Airbus has been providing and operating unmanned aerial systems for military and institutional customers. In 2019, as a “vote of confidence”, four nations (France, Germany, Italy and Spain) designated Airbus as the prime contractor for the development of the future European Medium Altitude Long Endurance Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (MALE RPAS) programme.

Airbus has a successful history in developing UAV technology. The Barracuda Agile UAV, which first flew in 2006, provided in-depth understanding of high-speed drones and autonomous operations demonstrating several new technologies. In October 2018, with the trust of the German customer, Airbus demonstrated a successful cooperation of DT-25 target drones and a LearJet aircraft, clearing some of the key challenges related to Manned-Unmanned Teaming. Airbus continues to invest in advanced communications and teaming intelligence, with the next big milestone being a multi-domain demonstration planned for 2022.

The below video summarises what Airbus has so far achieved in the field of Manned-Unmanned Teaming, including the 2018 flight test over the Baltic Sea and the 2019 dual mission group demonstration. The future ambition for multi mission group operations is also presented.

Airbus’ technological roadmap to make Manned-Unmanned Teaming a reality focuses on several areas. Firstly, the unmanned assets need to be able to communicate with the manned assets and amongst each other in an agile and robust way. For this reason, we are developing advanced data link solutions in conjunction with the wider Multi-Domain Combat Cloud, another key element of FCAS to be detailed in a later article. Secondly, efficient use of packs of manned and unmanned vehicles requires coordination and optimisation and may vary from one mission to the next. Hence Airbus is developing AI-based teaming intelligence concepts and algorithms, including swarming and distributed intelligence. Finally, we are preparing airframe solutions for the future unmanned systems, building on our experience in both UAVs and combat aircraft, but also leveraging pack the skills of our FCAS partners. Once these building blocks are put together, a whole new world of opportunities will open up, challenging today’s technological and doctrinal paradigms.

The possible applications of Manned-Unmanned Teaming nevertheless, go beyond combat scenarios. Simplified cooperation of piloted and pilotless assets can also prove beneficial in fields such as Maritime Patrol or Search and Rescue missions, where already in-service unmanned aerial systems could vastly improve the manned platforms’ situational awareness. Airbus Helicopters is also looking at teaming combat helicopters with rotary wing drones, which could dramatically increase their survivability and lethality. Given the multi-domain nature of the combat cloud, teaming with manned or unmanned land or marine-based assets is also a potential opportunity.

Today Airbus is at the forefront of developments in Manned-Unmanned Teaming, having already successfully demonstrated leading technological as well as industrial capabilities. The benefits brought forward by this technology will boost capabilities of both piloted and pilotless aircraft. Manned-unmanned teaming is truly a case in point where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts."
Airbus to bring first Mars samples to Earth: ESA contract award - Airbus,"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMC0xMC1haXJidXMtdG8tYnJpbmctZmlyc3QtbWFycy1zYW1wbGVzLXRvLWVhcnRoLWVzYS1jb250cmFjdC1hd2FyZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A new decade of European exploration – to the Moon and Mars

Airbus to design and build the Earth Return Orbiter (ERO) for Mars Sample Return (MSR) campaign

ERO will reach Mars orbit, capture orbiting samples launched from the Red Planet and bring them back to Earth

Toulouse, 14 October 2020 – Airbus has been selected by the European Space Agency (ESA) as prime contractor for the Mars Sample Return’s Earth Return Orbiter (ERO) – the first ever spacecraft to bring samples back to Earth from Mars. Mars Sample Return (MSR) is a joint ESA-NASA campaign and the next step in the exploration of Mars. ERO and the Sample Fetch Rover (SFR) are the two main European elements of MSR, both are set to be designed and built by Airbus. A manipulating arm, referred to as the Sample Transfer Arm (STA), that will transfer the samples from the SFR to the Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV), is the third European contribution to the MSR program. The value of the ERO contract is € 491 million.

The five year mission will see the spacecraft head to Mars, act as a communication relay with the surface missions, perform a rendezvous with the orbiting samples and bring them safely back to Earth. Prior to launch from the Mars surface onboard the MAV, the Martian samples will be stored in sample tubes and collected by the SFR, for which Airbus has already commenced the study phase.

For ERO, Airbus will use its autonomous rendezvous and docking expertise built up over decades of experience in optical navigation, using technologies from the successful ATV (Automated Transfer Vehicle) and recent developments from JUICE, Europe’s first mission to Jupiter.

“We’re bringing the full force of our experience gained on Rosetta, Mars Express, Venus Express, Gaia, ATV, BepiColombo, and JUICE to ensure this mission succeeds. Bringing samples back to Earth from Mars will be an extraordinary feat, taking interplanetary science to a new level and Airbus is excited to take on this challenge as part of this joint international mission. ” said Jean-Marc Nasr, Head of Airbus Space Systems.

To be launched on an Ariane 6 in 2026, the 6 ton, 6 m high spacecraft, equipped with 144m² solar arrays with a span of over 40 m – some of the biggest ever built – will take about a year to reach Mars. It will use a mass-efficient hybrid propulsion system combining electric propulsion for the cruise and spiral down phases and chemical propulsion for Mars orbit insertion. Upon arrival, it will provide communications coverage for the NASA Perseverance Rover and Sample Retrieval Lander (SRL) missions, two essential parts of the MSR Campaign.

For the second part of its mission, ERO will have to detect, rendezvous with, and capture a basketball-size object called the Orbiting Sample (OS), which houses the sample tubes collected by SFR; all this over 50 million km away from ground control. Once captured, the OS will be bio-sealed in a secondary containment system and placed inside the Earth Entry Vehicle (EEV), effectively a third containment system, to ensure that the precious samples reach the Earth’s surface intact for maximum scientific return. It will then take another year for ERO to make its way back to Earth, where it will send the EEV on a precision trajectory towards a pre-defined landing site, before itself entering into a stable orbit around the Sun.

After landing, the samples will be transferred to a specialised handling facility where they will be quarantined. Once the sample tubes are opened, initial measurements will be taken to generate a detailed catalogue, enabling specific parts of the samples to then be targeted for specialist science investigations.

Airbus will have overall responsibility for the ERO mission, developing the spacecraft in Toulouse, and conducting mission analysis in Stevenage. Thales Alenia Space Turin will also have an important role, assembling the spacecraft, developing the communication system and providing the Orbit Insertion Module. The mission enabling RIT-2X ion engines will be provided by ArianeGroup.

About Mars Sample Return

Mars Sample Return is a set of three separately launched missions, which will together achieve the objective of returning Mars samples to Earth before the end of 2031.

The NASA-led Mars 2020 rover, known as Perseverance, was launched in July 2020 to land on Mars in February 2021. Perseverance will acquire Mars samples, cache them into sample tubes, and leave the tubes in one or more depots for later collection by the SRL mission and its European Sample Fetch Rover.

The NASA-led SRL is to be launched in 2026 and comprises a surface platform with a European robotic Sample Transfer Arm (STA), the Sample Fetch Rover (SFR), and a Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV). The surface platform will land in the near vicinity of the sample tube depot in the Jezero crater. SFR will navigate, locate and collect the sample tubes, and return to the lander platform. The STA will transfer the sample tubes into the Orbiting Sample (OS) then load the OS aboard the MAV. The MAV will launch the OS into Mars orbit, where ERO will be waiting to rendezvous and capture it.

The ESA-led Earth Return Orbiter (ERO) is also to be launched in 2026 and will have onboard the NASA-led Capture, Containment and Return System (CCRS), which will handle and bio-seal the OS as well as provide the Earth Entry Vehicle (EEV). ERO will arrive in Mars orbit on time to provide communications coverage for the SRL entry, descent and landing, surface operations, and the MAV launch placing the OS into Mars orbit. ERO will have to detect, rendezvous with, and capture the OS. The OS will then be bio-sealed and transferred to the EEV before ERO heads back to Earth.

Upon approach to Earth, ERO will release the Earth Entry System on an Earth entry trajectory. After landing in the desert of Utah, the samples are transferred to a sample receiving and curation facility.

It looks like a spaceship, runs on fuel that up until a few years ago experts were calling “crazy,” and has barely left the drawing board, but in the eyes of one of the world’s leading aircraft manufacturers, it’s undoubtedly the future.

Not even the distant future. Airbus hopes we’ll be soaring into the skies on one of its radical new designs in just 15 years, leaving the days of jet engine pollution and flight-shaming far behind us.

The blended wing aircraft is one of a trinity of eco-friendly hydrogen-fueled models unveiled recently by Airbus as part of its ambitions to spearhead the decarbonization of the aviation industry.

It’s a bold plan, and one that just a few short months ago might have seemed fanciful as demand for fossil fuel-powered air travel continued to rise, apparently immune to growing environmental concerns.

But the arrival of Covid-19 and its impact on aviation could’ve inadvertently cleared a flight path of opportunity for efforts to rethink the technology of getting the world up into the air.

Airbus has baptized its new program ZEROe. The designs revealed aren’t prototypes but a starting point to explore the tech needed in order to start building the first climate-neutral commercial planes.

“How can you possibly emerge from the pandemic, with climate neutrality as a core long-term competitiveness factor?” Airbus’s chief technology officer, Grazia Vittadini, asked rhetorically, during a briefing about the new plans.

“It would be impossible not to. Even well before the crisis, it has become an acknowledged and shared view that protecting climate and protecting our environment are key indispensable factors upon which we have to build the future of flight,” she said.

Why hydrogen?

Airbus’s plan to bring to market a zero-emission passenger aircraft by 2035 means it needs to start plotting a course in terms of technology in 2025. In fact it needs to plot several courses.

That’s because no single technology can address the energy requirements to fuel the entire spectrum of aircraft types – from flying taxis through to short-, medium- and long-range airplanes.

While having been recently more focused on electric aviation for small airplanes, Airbus has now pivoted towards hydrogen as a candidate for solving aviation’s CO2 problems.

“Our experience with batteries shows us that battery technology is not moving at the pace we want,” says Glenn Llewellyn, vice president of zero emission aircraft at Airbus. “This is where hydrogen comes in, it’s got several thousand times more energy per kilogram than what batteries could have today.”

Llewellyn says Airbus has already started talking hydrogen with airlines, energy companies and with airports, because “this kind of change really requires a teaming across industry and inside the aviation industry in order to make it happen.”

Hydrogen has long been seen as a viable fuel by academics, but until now it’s had little practical support.

Perhaps now, with batteries not quite cutting it, hydrogen’s time has come.

“Eighteen months ago, when people talked about hydrogen in the aerospace industry, people thought you were slightly crazy,” Iain Gray, director of aerospace at Cranfield University, tells CNN Travel.

“But now hydrogen has become something that everybody is seeing as a very significant solution to the zero carbon problems,” says Gray. Cranfield has been supporting ZeroAvia – a startup that received a £2.7m ($3.3 million) grant from the UK government to develop zero emission aviation technologies, achieving the world’s first hydrogen fuel cell-powered flight of a commercial-grade aircraft at Cranfield Airport in September.

All for one and one for all

Airbus has released this rendering of the turbofan concept. Airbus

The three ZEROe concepts program include a 120-200 passenger turbofan with a range of 2,000+ nautical miles, capable of operating transcontinentally and powered by a modified gas-turbine engine running on hydrogen. The liquid hydrogen will be stored and distributed via tanks located behind the rear pressure bulkhead.

Then there’s a 100-passenger airplane which uses a turboprop engine powered by hydrogen combustion in modified gas-turbine engines. It would be capable of traveling more than 1,000 nautical miles, making it a suitable option for short-haul trips.

However, the real conversation piece in the trio – pictured at the top of of this article – has a “blended-wing body,” where the wings merge with the fuselage of the aircraft to produce a highly streamlined shape, like a “flying wing”. This option shares its aeronautical DNA with Airbus’s MAVERIC demonstrator aircraft ,which underwent flight tests last year to explore the energy-saving advantages of this futuristic type of airplane layout.

Looking like something out of Star Trek, Airbus’s blended-wing hydrogen airplane could carry up to 200 passengers. Its unique configuration would facilitate a radical new type of cabin interior layout for passengers, while providing ample space for hydrogen storage.

How a hydrogen aircraft works

Hydrogen can be used in different ways to power airplanes: It can be combusted directly through modified gas turbines; it can be converted into electric energy, using fuel cells; and hydrogen combined with CO2 can be used to produce synthetic kerosene.

“For us, it’s particularly important to combine the first two of these three elements – having direct combustion of hydrogen through modified gas turbines, with an embedded electric motor, powered by fuel cells,” says Airbus’s Vittadini.

“To accelerate on this path, we already have in the pipeline a zero-emission demonstrator, which will be fundamental, especially to de-risk concepts such as refueling of such an aircraft and safe storage and distribution of hydrogen on board an aircraft,” she adds.

Could existing jet engines run on hydrogen?

Since it’s already been successfully proven that sustainable aviation fuel can be substituted into existing jet engines, the question now is whether hydrogen could also be a “drop in” fuel.

This is something that Rolls-Royce (which is not associated with the ZEROe program) has been looking at, having successfully tested its Trent engines with a hydrogen/kerosene blend in the past.

“Moving to 100% hydrogen would require adaptation to current gas turbine design,” Alan Newby, director of aerospace technology and future programs at Rolls-Royce Civil Aerospace, tells CNN Travel.

But Newby also explains that the biggest challenge would be managing the flame temperature and stability in the combustion system. Then there is the question of adapting the fuel delivery and management system, notably for liquid hydrogen. Another caveat, he notes, is that one kilo of hydrogen has three times the energy of kerosene, but more importantly, it takes up five times the volume.

“So the answer is – yes, it is possible but there would need to be a big focus on redesigning these elements of the current engine design as well as looking at the gas turbine as a complete tank-to-exhaust system and taking a more holistic, overall system level approach,” says Newby.

This is the ZEROe turboprop concept plane. Airbus

How these concepts could change commercial aviation

The unveiling of the Airbus concepts symbolizes a milestone in terms of civil aerospace adopting hydrogen at the top tier of industry.

True, ongoing efforts with smaller aircraft and drones using hydrogen and hydrogen fuel cells are plentiful. However, Airbus’s announcement signifies a major strategic shift for commercial aviation, whereby hydrogen could become the norm for short- and medium-haul flights for the 2030s and beyond.

“But there’s no point in addressing a hydrogen airplane if you’re not going to look at the system in which it operates,” cautions Gray.

Aviation “needs to address the whole zero carbon issue in a holistic systems way, looking at airports, air traffic control, aircraft, and transport to and from airports,” he explains.

Fortunately, the dialogue between stakeholders appears to be underway.

“This is going to create a massive change in the energy and aviation ecosystem,” says Airbus’s Glenn Llewellyn. “We’ve already started working with airlines, energy companies, and with airports because this kind of change really requires a teaming across industry and inside the aviation industry in order to make it happen.”

This necessity for a holistic approach dovetails neatly with the aspiration among airport operators to reduce their own carbon footprint – hydrogen could power many aspects of airport infrastructure.

For example, in 2015, Memphis International Airport carried out a two-year demonstration of the world’s first zero-emissions, hydrogen fuel cell-powered ground support equipment, saving over 175,000 gallons of diesel fuel and 1,700 metric tons of CO2.

In a separate initiative at Toulouse-Blagnac Airport, a hydrogen production and distribution station is being installed for fueling hydrogen-powered buses.

What makes hydrogen a compelling fuel for airports is the fact that it can be produced on-site as well as from the airport’s waste materials.

Finnish airport company Finavia is among those evaluating its practicality.

“We’re looking at how we could use the waste streams at Finavia’s airports, including the waste from glycol (the fluid used for de-icing airplanes) to generate hydrogen,” says Henri Hansson, senior vice president of infrastructures and sustainability.

A significant leap towards eco-friendly air travel

Having a common fuel that airlines and airports alike can use is a total gamechanger for the industry.

The introduction of hydrogen airplanes and the extent of its environmental benefit will depend on the degree of uptake over coming years. Airbus’s Vittadini says that “our estimation is that it will contribute by more than 50% along our journey to decarbonizing aviation.”

There are, however, still many technological hurdles ahead in commercializing any type of sizable hydrogen airplane.

This is partly due to weight and size constraints, says Newby, but “also because the industry’s reliability and safety requirements are set very high, which requires very high engineering maturity barriers to be achieved, particularly for passenger-carrying services.”

And hydrogen-powered aviation is no silver bullet, he says. It will take a combination of different solutions, including sustainable aviation fuels, electric, hybrid and more efficient gas turbines, powering different missions, to help the industry reach its emissions goals.

“Timing-wise,” says Newby, “small hydrogen-powered regional aircraft could potentially be available before the end of the decade.”

What this means for fliers

Until Airbus settles on a configuration, it’s too early to know what form the passenger cabin will take or what the on-board experience will look like.

But what can be reliably predicted is what it will feel like from a human sensibilities standpoint. Hydrogen could be the antidote to flight-shaming, if Airbus can get ZEROe off the ground.

Launching these concepts in the midst of a pandemic might even be a stroke of genius on Airbus’s part, now that people have had time, while being cooped up, to reflect on the privilege of affordable aviation while acknowledging its impact on the planet.

“Covid, ironically, has reminded many people of what the world looks like when they’re not seeing contrails and not hearing large jet engines,” says Gray. “Flying, per se, is not the problem; carbon is the problem which we’re trying to address.”

“Flying has given individuals around the world great personal and professional travel opportunities, therefore the emphasis has got to be on solving the emissions and the carbon problems. Hydrogen is a gamechanger, and the industry is up for it.”"

Airbus has a new private jet for sale.

The Airbus Corporate Jet 220, also called the ""TwoTwenty,"" is the private jet version of the popular A220 airliner. A step above the likes of Gulfstream, Bombardier, and Dassault, Airbus said the driving force behind the project was that private flyers were seeking larger aircraft, hence the manufacturer's new designation: ""the xtra large biz jet.""

Airbus teamed up with private jet operator and aircraft interior completion firm Comlux to come up with the first luxurious design, incorporating recent innovations in cabin technology to create a truly ultra-modern private jet. Space wasn't an issue as the airliner-sized cabin allows for massive living areas and even includes a shower and king-size bed.

As one of the newest aircraft in the skies, its buyers can enjoy the cost savings that come with an aircraft as advanced as the A220. Fuel consumption, for example, is reduced by 25% on the ACJ220 compared to previous-generation airliners thanks to new engines and other aerodynamic features.

5 actions to protect your aircraft from cyberattacks - Airbus Aircraft,"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vYWlyY3JhZnQuYWlyYnVzLmNvbS9lbi81LWFjdGlvbnMtdG8tcHJvdGVjdC15b3VyLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWZyb20tY3liZXJhdHRhY2tz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"29 October, 2020 Cyberattacks across all industries and countries regularly hit the headlines with record financial impacts, unquantifiable reputational damages and serious operational disruptions. Just last year, the World Economic Forum stated that cyberattacks are one of the top ten global risks of highest concern in the next decade. The aerospace sector is a prime target for cybercriminals worldwide. In the last few years, a number of aerospace actors have been affected by cyberattacks ranging from theft of personal data, to operations disruption and even supply chain corruption. The European Aviation Security Agency (EASA) estimates a monthly average of 1,000 airport cyberattacks. In the face of this, the international regulatory framework is continuously being strengthened, bringing in new security and safety regulations and rapidly changing the requirements airlines and other aerospace stakeholders have to comply with. In October 2020, the American Federal watchdog urged the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to implement more actions to prevent cyberattacks on airplanes. In 2019, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) adopted the A40-10 Assembly Resolution, urging states to implement the Aviation Cybersecurity Strategy.

Only as strong as its weakest link

This surge of regulation updates is impacting not only the obvious areas of the aircraft ecosystem but also the whole value chain around aircraft operations. Theft or leak of passenger personal data are probably the most common attacks airlines have been facing in recent years. Although the number of attacks are high and extremely damaging for the airlines’ reputation, they are also the most critical to resolve, with many airlines currently investing heavily in the security of their IT systems.

Many other areas of the aircraft ecosystem can be compromised by a cyberattack and need to be managed accordingly. For several years now, the rise of a more connected, digital aircraft has increased risks of cyberattacks. Even though statistically less common, cyberattacks on the connectivity items of the aircraft are regarded as the most critical and impactful threats, prompting the need to mitigate the risk of a cybersecurity breach in this area. The entire aviation value chain is therefore a potential target for cybercriminals, driving the need for a holistic approach to cybersecurity in aviation.

Holistic approach to cybersecurity in aviation

Impacting all areas of the business

The drive for new regulations around cybersecurity in aviation not only originates from the impact a cyberattack can have on companies and their employees but also society at large. When we hear of a cyberattack the first thing that comes to mind is the financial impact on an organisation, for example, 1 hour operations disruption at a large airport at peak time has an estimated cost of $1m. In general, the cost of a cyberattack is estimated around $1m. Aside from financial impacts, aviation actors also face serious credibility issues, which can negatively impact their reputation and brand image and lead to unquantifiable secondary financial impacts.

Recent examples of cyberattacks

Financial In 2020, 10 000 customers of a European airline filed a legal suit, potentially leading to large financial compensation, after a cyberattack resulted in the disclosure of customer personal data.

Operations In 2019, 6 flights of an American airline were cancelled because of a malicious cyberattack.

Reputation In 2020, a European airline suffered a personal data theft potentially affecting 380,000 people. The share price heavily dropped due to loss of credibility.

Shift in mindset

Raising pressure from international regulators and from the intensity of cyberthreats are driving airlines and other aviation actors alike to invest in cybersecurity measures. In 2019, it is estimated the training of employees and the compliance with security and safety regulations represent the two main cybersecurity expenses for airlines. It is anticipated that the investments in these areas will significantly increase with the setup of a stronger regulatory framework.

Nonetheless, although this shift in mindset is occurring in the aviation industry, all actors are facing issues in effectively securing their operations. One of the main concerns raised is the need for more proactivity amidst the rising security threats. Increasing employee awareness of cyberattacks and how to prevent them has become a rising challenge for airlines. Employees are often considered as the potential weakest link in the value chain. Giving them a key role to play in securing the entire ecosystem and reinforcing safety behaviours have become critical for aerospace actors.

Most threats result from a human error or behaviour

System complexity is also making it increasingly harder for aviation companies to globally manage security risks. Digitalisation, connectivity and automation all contribute to the difficulty of ensuring all areas of the ecosystem are protected from cyberthreats. Another pain point is understanding and mastering the current and coming cybersecurity measures. The rapid evolution of regulations and standards require aerospace companies to constantly monitor and act on these regulatory shifts. The sheer amount of them is enough to create complexity that even the biggest structures struggle to master. Additionally, National Airworthiness Authorities (NAA) can request evidence from airlines that Instructions and Assumptions from the Airbus Security Handbook are properly applied.

How can I avoid cyberattacks?

#01 Train your team

Employee awareness is the single most important element in your defense against cyberthreats. With rising numbers of cyberattacks across the aviation industry, making your employees aware of security threats and helping them understand how to effectively protect your company is paramount. A variety of training is available on the market today to help you prepare your team and compensate for their lack of expertise.

#02 Audit your security processes

Although it’s difficult to foresee how constraining future frameworks will be, regulatory entities such as EASA and FAA are planning to implement new regulations in the coming years. Mitigating the risk of non-compliance can be challenging. Today, many options are available to assess or audit your security implementations and ensure you have everything in place to avoid a possible attack or fine.

#03 Secure your network

Protect your entire company’s IT infrastructure by setting up a layered approach to your defence. Typically, companies look into installing firewalls, antimalware, antivirus, identity and access control, etc. A holistic approach should be preferred when bringing in these different types of IT security solutions to avoid creating hidden back doors, which could still compromise your entire IT network.

#04 Create a Security Operations Centre

A Security Operations Centre (SOC) allows you to control, monitor and detect any incoming threats to your system and respond to them in the most appropriate way. The SOC goes hand in hand with a defined set of rules and response measures for each type of incident. These need to be defined upfront and revised regularly to keep up with the evolving threats.

Tit-for-Tat Tariffs Don’t Work: Boeing and Airbus Show Why - Competitive Enterprise Institute,"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vY2VpLm9yZy9ibG9nL3RpdC1mb3ItdGF0LXRhcmlmZnMtZG9udC13b3JrLWJvZWluZy1hbmQtYWlyYnVzLXNob3ctd2h5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A 16 year-long aerospace subsidies dispute between the United States and the European Union began another round this week. The U.S. claims that the EU’s Airbus subsidies are unfair. The EU argues that America’s Boeing subsidies are unfair. Both sides are right. But neither wants to admit that the other side has a point, too. The result has been tit-for-tat tariff increases and no subsidy reforms.

Today, the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled that the EU may impose tariffs on up to $3.99 billion of American goods, because Boeing’s favorable tax treatment violates WTO rules.

This follows a 2019 decision allowing the U.S. to impose tariffs on up to $7.5 billion of EU goods due to the EU’s Airbus subsidies.

Boeing called today’s decision “irrelevant.” Last year, Washington state repealed the tax provision at the center of this decision. However, the larger sticking point in the dispute remains. Yes, this one tax break is gone, but Boeing still receives massive subsidies. That means the EU will not stop pressing the matter. Nor has the EU reformed Airbus’ special treatment. That means the U.S. won’t stop, either.

In addition to being ineffective, the tariffs are causing collateral damage to other industries that have nothing to do with the dispute, from French wines to American motorcycles. This deadweight loss matters at a time when the world economy is already hurting due to COVID-19.

The lesson both sides need to learn is, don’t copy other people’s mistakes. Instead, set a better example. Subsidized companies grow soft and lose their competitive edge. There is a reason why so much aerospace innovation these days, from space travel to supersonic flight, is happening outside of Boeing and Airbus’ subsidized comfort.

The right thing to do is for governments to stop subsidizing private businesses—even if the other side doesn’t. Set the right example. Boeing would likely do just fine without subsidies. They would certainly have far more incentive to improve their products and address their safety concerns than they do now.

And if Boeing can’t survive without subsidies, there is no shortage of entrepreneurs capable of unleashing engineering and manufacturing talent.

Either way, consumers and taxpayers win. Europe and Airbus can then either follow America’s positive example or be content with subsidized mediocrity. Realistically, they will very likely choose the subsidies. But we cannot let Europe’s mistakes be our own. The U.S. has been doing that for at least 16 years now, and we know it doesn’t work.

A modest starting point on the U.S. side would be closing the Export-Import Bank, which often devotes half of its business to securing below-market financing rates for Boeing’s customers, many of whom are state-owned. Boeing set record profits while Ex-Im was mothballed from 2014-2019, so we already know the company will do just fine without that multi-billion-dollar program.

For more on that idea, see my most recent Ex-Im paper."

These aircraft, along with a third scheduled for delivery early next year, will be based at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida and operated for a variety of missions, including aerial security at rocket launches, emergency medical services, research, and qualified passenger transportation.

“As NASA looked to renew its aging fleet of helicopters, the H135 was selected due to its performance, capabilities and ability to meet our needs as we look to the future of manned space launch. We are very pleased to now welcome it to our fleet,” said David Ramsey, Chief of Flight Operations at NASA Kennedy Space Center. “For years to come, these helicopters will not only support security and routine missions at the Kennedy Space Center, but also support our astronauts and crew as they launch important missions to the ISS, the moon and beyond.”

In October, one of the H135s will escort the members of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon to the historic launch pad at 39A, where it will depart for a six-month expedition to the ISS. The helicopters will also support efforts to prepare for and execute Artemis, a planned expedition to land the first woman and the next man on the moon by 2024.

“Working with NASA is something that many of us – including myself – have dreamed of since we were kids, and we stand ready to fully support their new H135s as they support furthering space exploration,” said Romain Trapp, President of Airbus Helicopters Inc., and Head of the North American region. “Building a helicopter that helps NASA drive critical advances in science and aerospace technology is truly an honor and privilege.”

The helicopters were acquired through the U.S. Government’s General Services Administration’s agreement with Davenport Aviation, a certified woman-owned small business and HUBZone contractor specializing in the supply of aerospace equipment to federal, state and local government agencies.

“We are proud to have supplied aircraft for yet another branch of the U.S. Government, and are especially excited to play a role in supporting space programs for years to come with NASA,” said Cassie Strasburg, VP Government Division with Davenport Aviation.

Airbus’ light, twin-engine H135 is equipped with the most advanced technologies available, including Airbus Helicopters’ own Helionix avionics suite. Operated by close to 300 customers worldwide, it is known for its excellent performance, endurance, reliability and versatility.

NASA also recently signed a $15 million support contract for up to 10 years, in which Airbus Helicopters Inc. will fully support NASA’s H135 fleet, including maintenance and flight operations with two pilots, two mechanics and one program manager onsite at Kennedy Space Center.

Airbus Helicopters Inc. is the leading supplier of helicopters in the United States, with a presence dating back 50 years, a team of more than 725 employees, world-class training and support solutions, and local production and completion facilities for the H125 and UH-72 Lakota aircraft.

Hours after Boeing revealed large financial losses due to coronavirus, its European rival, Airbus, has announced an even deeper loss.

Its third-quarter results show Airbus lost €2.7bn (£2.5bn) in the first nine months of 2020. In the corresponding period last year it made a €2.2bn (£2bn) profit.

The firm’s revenue slumped by 35 per cent as deliveries of its aircraft slowed. It has 135 undelivered planes.

In its announcement, Airbus said: “The Covid-19 pandemic is weighing on the performance of development, production, flight testing, aircraft delivery and retrofit activities.”

Airbus warned that the recovery of global air travel is slower than anticipated, and that it “may face additional risks and uncertainties resulting from future consequences of the health and economic crisis on airlines, lessors and other actors in the air transport industry”.

The ending of production of the Airbus A380 “SuperJumbo” has proved expensive for Airbus. It recorded a further €26m (£24m) impairment on programme costs for the plane after the main customer, Emirates, decided to make no further orders.

Emirates yesterday despatched the first of its retired A380s from Dubai to Lourdes in southern France.

British Airways has not operated the jet since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, and other carriers say they are temporarily or permanently to stop flying the A380.

Airbus also took a €221m (£202m) hit from a Saudi military contract it could not complete due to Germany’s suspension of defence export licences to Saudi Arabia."

Bremen, 14 October 2020 – Airbus has been selected by the European Space Agency (ESA) as one of the two primes for the definition phase of the European Large Logistic Lander (EL3). In this study (phase A/B1), Airbus will develop the concept of a large multi-role logistic lander able to transport up to 1.7 tons of cargo to any location on the lunar surface. EL3 flights are set to begin in the late 2020s, with a cadence of missions over the following decade and more.

Europe is already contributing to the Global Exploration Roadmap agreed by 14 space agencies around the world, in which Airbus is also playing its part. European participation includes international missions to Mars, substantial elements for crewed space stations – the International Space Station and the Lunar Gateway – and the Orion European Service Module (ESM) which will power Artemis, the next human mission to the lunar surface.

With EL3, ESA and its member states will make a further substantial European contribution to the international effort to establish sustainable exploration of the Moon. EL3 will be designed as a fully independent European lunar surface logistics mission capability, including European launch capability with Ariane 6. ESA anticipates flying three to five EL3 missions over a 10 year time frame.

Andreas Hammer, Head of Space Exploration at Airbus, said: “We are extremely thrilled to be starting the definition phase of EL3, Europe’s large Moon lander. Last year in Seville, Europe’s space ministers agreed that the European Space Agency should start preparing a vehicle to fly scientific and logistics cargo to the Moon. Airbus is 100% behind this ambition, as it will enable Europe to play a critical role in the next phase of human exploration of the Moon, and will further strengthen ESA’s status as an invaluable partner in the international space community.”

Based on a generic plug-and-play landing element, the EL3 could support a range of lunar activities including: logistics support for crewed missions on the Moon (Artemis base camp), scientific missions with rovers and static payloads, or a sample return mission.

To achieve sustained human presence on the Moon, considerable logistical infrastructure will be needed – whether testing critical technologies or prospecting for lunar resources, starting in-situ production and storage of products like propellant, drinking water or oxygen, or even creating a long term settlement.

EL3’s journey: an independent, all-European solution

EL3, launched on an Ariane 64 from Kourou as a single payload of up to 8.5 tons, can be put on a direct trajectory to the Moon, similar to the trajectory flown by Apollo 50 years ago.

After roughly four days of barbecue-like travel (ie slow and constant rotation to optimise the thermal control of the spacecraft), insertion into a low lunar orbit (LLO) will be achieved by EL3’s own propulsion system. Depending on the launch window and the landing site on the Moon, EL3 might remain for up to 14 days in LLO, waiting for the right point in time and space to initiate landing.

EL3 Airbus concept will use vision based navigation techniques, first developed by Airbus for the ATV ISS resupply vehicle during the elliptical descent orbit and powered descent to achieve unprecedented landing precision. What’s more, EL3 will be equipped with an autonomous hazard detection and avoidance system. This system will scan the landing site for potential hazards (small rocks, craters, or local slopes) which are too small for identification by remote sensing satellites. Based on this autonomous hazard assessment, the safest landing spot in reach will be identified and the lander will be guided to this location.

The study will be led by the lunar exploration team in Bremen, Airbus’ hub for space exploration activities and will involve more than 20 engineers from five Airbus sites in Germany, France, and the UK. Airbus will be working with six companies and one research institute from seven different countries across Europe.

EVERETT — Washington shouldn’t shy away from marketing its top-notch aerospace sector to a broader audience — including Boeing’s archrival Airbus, union leaders told lawmakers this week.

Given an opportunity to recruit the European jet maker, officials should do so, said Jon Holden, president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751, which represents thousands of Boeing workers in Washington. Holden and others addressed the state Senate Special Committee on Economic Recovery on Tuesday during an online meeting.

“COVID is placing extreme pressure on the commercial airline industry,” Holden said. “We’re seeing severe layoffs at Boeing and within the aerospace supply chain in the state.”

Despite the present circumstances, he added, “Washington is still well prepared to support the aerospace industry of today and the future.”

Weathering the devastating economic downturn requires fresh faces, Ray Goforth, executive director of the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace, told the committee. His union represents about 15,000 aerospace workers in Washington.

“The focus of the Legislature should really be about how to attract additional work, whether it’s coming from the supply chain, or even from Airbus,” Goforth said.

As it happens, high-ranking state officials have sought out Airbus several times in the past decade, with Gov. Christine Gregoire attending the 2011 Paris Air Show and Gov. Jay Inslee meeting with an Airbus executive in 2013 at a Seattle aerospace gathering.

In 2015, Airbus made a statement when it opened an A320 assembly line in Mobile, Alabama, to serve North American buyers of that popular model, which competes with Boeing’s 737.

Today Airbus, like other aircraft manufacturers, is facing serious headwinds. It’s in the process of laying off 15,000 workers, 10% of its workforce, by the end of next year, although the company plans to build the A320neo family at a faster pace next year.

Airbus expansion in the U.S. doesn’t seem likely anytime soon.

Meanwhile, Boeing’s footprint in Washington has been shrinking. Goforth told committee members that Boeing “has been outsourcing engineering and technical work” to Russia and other locations for decades while laying off employees in the Northwest.

There’s no reason to believe that Boeing’s outsourcing efforts will stop because the company is currently shedding jobs, Goforth said. If anything, the pandemic is ”just accelerating decisions that were already in the mix.”

When lawmakers asked Goforth what they could do, he advised them to check allegiance at the door.

“We still think of Boeing as a Washington company. Boeing does not,” Goforth said. “If there’s an opportunity to bring other aircraft manufacturers here, we should do that.”

Loyalty to Boeing among state leaders runs deep. In 2003, lawmakers authorized billions of dollars in incentives — tax breaks intended to persuade Boeing to build the 787 here. In 2013, that tax break was extended to 2040, helping convince the company to build the 777X in Everett. In February, however, Boeing asked state lawmakers to suspend a preferential business-and-occupation tax rate, which the World Trade Organization targeted as an illegal trade subsidy. They complied.

Last year, Washington’s aerospace industry employed nearly 89,000 people and generated $73 billion in gross income, Seattle economic and trade consultant Spencer Cohen said.

Today the sector is reeling from layoffs and losses. The COVID-19 pandemic has crushed the airline and travel industries.

Some of the largest U.S. airlines are experiencing revenue losses of 80% or more, compared to 2019, said Scott Kennedy, Alaska Airlines’ state and local government affairs manager.

Passenger counts are down more than 60% this year. The airline industry isn’t expected to recover for at least three or four years, Kennedy said.

So far this year, Boeing has eliminated 13,000 jobs across Washington. The company said on Wednesday that over the next year it plans to eliminate another 7,000 positions. Boeing’s global headcount was 160,000 at the beginning of the year. Attrition and layoffs could thin the ranks to 130,000 by the end of 2021.

In 2018, Boeing was planning a new airplane program. State and union leaders set out to persuade Boeing to build the next airplane model here. Their efforts included commissioning multiple independent studies evaluating Washington’s aerospace sector.

Prominent aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia’s firm, the Teal Group, was among the surveyors.

The final report was glowing. Washington is the most competitive U.S. location, it concluded.

But after the grounding of the 737 Max after two crashes, and with the economic devastation from the pandemic, Boeing has put an expected new airplane program on the back burner.

Aboulafia told the Senate panel: “If they do start a new program, Everett is very much the natural place to build it.”

JetBlue Airways' first Airbus A220 just rolled out of the paint shop in Mobile, Alabama in advance of its December delivery as the airline embarks on a much-needed fleet renewal for its short-haul fleet.

The new jet comes complete with a new tail pattern, called ""Hops,"" crafted by JetBlue's own designers in homage to the practice in aviation of hopping, where a traveler takes multiple short trips or flights that add up to a ""larger journey.""

JetBlue's first Airbus A220 was built in Mobile, Alabama. JetBlue Airways

JetBlue first placed a 60-aircraft order for the larger A220-300 in 2018, snubbing the Embraer E190-E2 aircraft given its history with the Brazilian manufacturer. Jetblue has since ordered an additional 10 Airbus A220s, which will be made in the US as Airbus recently finished construction on an A220 final assembly line in Alabama.

The Airbus A220 aircraft will be replacing JetBlue's 60 aging Embraer E190s used primarily on short-haul routes from New York, Boston, and Fort Lauderdale, Florida. JetBlue took delivery of its first E190 in 2005 and the interiors haven't been updated since, while new aircraft have featured cabin and in-flight entertainment upgrades.

While Jetblue's A220 interior design remains a guarded secret, Paxex.Aero reports that the aircraft will seat 140 passengers in a 2-3 configuration. A JetBlue spokesperson, however, wouldn't confirm any details about the aircraft.

JetBlue estimates that the Airbus jet will offer a 40% reduction in fuel burn while offering up to 160 seats compared to the E190's 100 seats in JetBlue's configuration. Powering the new aircraft are two Pratt & Whitney PW1500G geared turbofan engines with wing attachments, known as winglets, adding to its efficiency.

The airline also hinted at using the airline on transcontinental routes, which would aid its new point-to-point strategy of opening more routes from non-hub cities. The West Coast, in particular, is seeing an increase of JetBlue routes from Los Angeles to cities like Charleston, South Carolina; West Palm Beach, Florida; and Raleigh, North Carolina.

Once the aircraft is delivered in December, JetBlue will be only the second airline in the US to fly the Airbus A220, which Boeing tried to keep out of the country when Delta placed a 125-aircraft order for the jet in 2016. The Boeing-initiated controversy saw Airbus take a majority stake in the aircraft and rebrand it as the Airbus A220, shedding nearly every reference to Bombardier and the CSeries name, apart from a small floor placard just beyond the boarding door.

Delta Air Lines began flying the smaller A220-100 model in February 2019 and will start flying the larger variant in November from its Salt Lake City hub. Air Canada began flying the A220-300 in January, making it the second North American operator of the A220, and David Neeleman's startup airline, Breeze Airways, also has plans to fly the A220.

The pandemic has lead JetBlue to accelerate deliveries of the aircraft to take advantage of its economic advantages driven by lower fuel consumption. The Points Guy reports that seven A220s will arrive at the airline in 2021 instead of an originally planned six, followed by eight in 2022.

JetBlue hasn't yet announced an entry into service date for its newest airliner but its press release for the A220 unveil states travelers will see the new design flying in 2021."
"Airbus' head of urban air mobility talks CityAirbus, Vahana and the timeline to air taxi operations - Vertical Magazine","Thu, 29 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3EtYW5kLWEvYWlyYnVzLXVhbS1oZWFkLWpvZXJnLW11bGxlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is taking a growing interest in the eVTOL and wider urban air mobility (UAM) market. Its direct work in the area includes the development of the Vahana single-seat demonstrator, which took its final test flight at the Pendleton unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) range in Oregon in the U.S. in November 2019. The OEM’s major focus is now the CityAirbus, a four-seat demonstrator that performed its first take-off in May 2019.

Joerg Mueller, head of UAM at Airbus, spoke to eVTOL.com about the company’s recent work in the domain and his thoughts on the broader potential of the market.

eVTOL.com: What is the current status of CityAirbus?

Joerg Mueller: The CityAirbus is currently undergoing a test program at the Ingolstadt Manching Airfield [in Germany]. CityAirbus, like Vahana before it, is a technology demonstrator, as opposed to a prototype that precedes serial production.

Joerg Peter Mueller, head of urban air mobility at Airbus

The purpose of CityAirbus is to test a multi-rotor configuration, capable of carrying the payload necessary to offer a viable transport service. It also allows us to develop technological “bricks” like electrification and autonomy that will benefit traditional helicopters and urban air mobility platforms alike.

eVTOL.com: How can you take your experience from developing modern helicopters and apply it to the eVTOL domain?

Joerg Mueller: Of course, helicopters are “VTOLs,” just without the “e”. This “e” has a big significance. Today, you simply cannot take a classic helicopter, put a battery inside instead of an engine and operate it in the same way that you did before. Electric flight requires a different architecture.

This is both a challenge and an opportunity. You can develop a vehicle now that adapts to the flight phase: for example, use an aerodynamically optimized wing in cruise. This makes it more energy efficient than the helicopters we are operating today.

Our decades-long experience with classic “VTOLs” is a big advantage and helps us in planning, development, testing, certification, and marketing.

eVTOL.com: What did the company learn from Vahana — has any of this been incorporated into CityAirbus?

Joerg Mueller: The results from our tilt-wing Vahana test flights have been analyzed and the results will be applied to our future eVTOL developments. The same is true for CityAirbus, a multicopter design. The aircraft are completely different [to one another] and represent configurations at the extreme opposite ends of the new design space for eVTOLs; they have been developed in parallel and by two separate teams. This allowed us to maximize our learnings about the possible architecture of eVTOLs.

eVTOL.com: Is your focus mainly on the air taxi market? Do you see potential in the cargo domain?

Joerg Mueller: There is a wide variety of potential applications for VTOL technologies, for passenger transport and for cargo, which can also include medical use cases. We have learnt a lot from our passenger vehicle demonstrators CityAirbus and Vahana, and completed flight trials on parcel and maritime deliveries with Skyways in Singapore. These new vehicles will complement helicopters, which will continue for the time being to be the only viable solution for missions with high range and payload requirements, such as emergency rescue, law enforcement, or military missions.

eVTOL.com: What are the major current challenges of developing eVTOLs?

Joerg Mueller: The main challenge is to develop an eVTOL that is not only able to fly but that can be certified and combines safety with cost efficiency. This starts with the vehicle configuration itself, where a large variety of new concepts becomes possible due to electrical propulsion. They all have pros and cons which strongly depend on the characteristics of the transport mission.

Furthermore, there is the question of energy storage and electric drive train, where batteries can only enable relatively short missions. Hydrogen could be an alternative, but it is less mature for now. There are also the technologies of autonomous flight that will allow operations without a pilot on board.

An eVTOL can only operate in a system of systems with infrastructure on the ground and an efficient or automated management of the traffic in the airspace. All these tasks will require significant investments. No company could do it alone — we depend on the entire [industrial] ecosystem.

eVTOL.com: How far away are we from air taxis being a reality? What is the long-term potential of this market for Airbus?

Joerg Mueller: We see the first, real-life demonstrations and punctual UAM services with pilots on board becoming available in the middle of the decade. However, operations at scale with a more efficient generation of eVTOLs and fully autonomous operations are probably around 10 years out. All of this will not only depend on the industry but also on the regulators for all aspects of UAM operations, in the air and on the ground."

Airbus selected for Communications and Mission System upgrade on the Royal Australian Air Force MRTT fleet - Airbus,"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMC0xMC1haXJidXMtc2VsZWN0ZWQtZm9yLWNvbW11bmljYXRpb25zLWFuZC1taXNzaW9uLXN5c3RlbS11cGdyYWRlLW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Brisbane, 12 October 2020 – Airbus has been selected by the Commonwealth of Australia (CoA) to develop a Communications and Mission System modernization upgrade for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) fleet.



The scope of work, which will meet the Air Force interoperability needs under their new operational requirements, will mainly cover a retrofit package, which includes new and additional Communications Capabilities and Enhanced Mission Systems, bringing it up to the latest enhanced A330 MRTT standard.

Split across two contracts, Phase 1 will see Airbus carry out the design and systems development and integration ahead of the Critical Design Review maturity gate. Phase 2 will see Airbus install and deliver a prototype KC-30 aircraft (the name used by the RAAF to the A330 MRTT) for use in the certification and qualification process, ahead of finalizing and supplying the modification kits for entire fleet. Subsequent retrofit to the remainder of the fleet will be under customer responsibility.

In addition, Airbus will provide the necessary data packs and support to ensure this upgrade features in the existing RAAF A330 MRTT Full Flight Simulator (FFS), the Integrated Procedures Trainer (IPT) and the Remote Air Refuelling Operator (RARO) Console Part Task trainer (PTT).

The objective of the upgrade is to provide an affordable solution which brings the RAAF KC-30A fleet up to Airbus’ world class quality and capability standards and meets the latest interoperability requirements for the Australian Defence Force and its allies.

The KC-30A MRTT is fitted with two types of air-to-air refuelling systems: an Advanced Refuelling Boom System mounted on the tail of the aircraft; and a pair of all-electric refuelling hose-and-drogue pods under each wing. These systems are controlled by an Air Refuelling Operator in the cockpit, who can view refuelling on 2D and 3D screens. The KC-30A can carry a fuel load of 111 tonnes and transfer part of that load to compatible aircraft, including other KC-30As.

Based on the successful A330-200 commercial aircraft, of which more than 1700 aircraft are operating worldwide, the A330 MRTT combines the advanced technology of a new generation tanker with the operational experience recorded during more than 200,000 FH in service.

In total, the A330 MRTT counts 61 orders and 45 aircraft already delivered and in operation.

The A330 Family legacy continues with the 1500th delivery - Airbus,"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIwLTEwLXRoZS1hMzMwLWZhbWlseS1sZWdhY3ktY29udGludWVzLXdpdGgtdGhlLTE1MDB0aC1kZWxpdmVyedIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The A330 Family’s 1,500th delivery on 21st September to Delta Air Lines says a great deal about the enduring qualities of the aircraft's original design, coupled with the constant infusion of the latest technologies, culminating in today’s A330neo variant. The application of ‘incremental innovations’, since its service entry, has resulted in the A330’s ongoing versatility, functionality, increased payload-range, class-leading economy with state-of-the-art Airspace cabin comfort and 4th generation IFE.

Today the A330neo builds on the A330ceo’s proven credentials, saving airlines around 25 percent fuel burn per seat compared with the previous-generation aircraft it replaces: the 767-300. Comprising two versions – the A330-900 (which first entered service in November 2018 with TAP) and the smaller A330-800 (which enters service in the coming weeks) – the NEO incorporates a new high-aspect ratio wing with carbon fibre wing tips, the latest-generation Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines with a 10:1 bypass ratio, more seats and new Airspace cabin features such as fully-variable colour LED mood lighting. It is noteworthy that the newest A330neo variant with a 251t MTOW (with certification iminent at the time of writing) can fly around 8,000nm with a full passenger load – around twice as far as the very first 212t A330-300 had achieved. Furthermore, the A330neo is a very quiet aircraft, exceeding the most stringent industry regulations – for example, achieving 16dB lower noise margin relative to ICAO Chapter 4.



Pioneering beginnings

Even before its first flight in 1992, the original A330-300 was a pioneer. It was Airbus' first long-range aircraft and the first programme to have an integrated final assembly facility with the FAL, the paintshop and cabin furnishing in the same place. The high level of operational synergy with the A320 – and also a ‘common-type-rating’ with the A350 – has further reinforced the Airbus ‘Family’.

The evolution of a product to replace the A300 – the world’s first widebody twin-engined airliner – was built on the strengths of the single-aisle A320 to create a bigger and truly modern long-range aircraft. By the time of its launch, the A330-300 offered 56 more seats than its predecessor, incorporated fly-by-wire technology, had a six-screen glass cockpit and came with a choice of three engine types from General Electric, Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce respectively. At the EIS in January 1994, the A330-300’s MTOW (maximum take-off weight) was 212 tonnes and the range was around 4,000nm. A smaller version, the A330-200, was subsequently made available with a MTOW of 230 tonnes and a longer range of 6,200nm. Meanwhile the A330-300 had added another 1,000nm to its range.



Further A330 Family improvements were introduced between 2000 and 2003: The flight deck benefitted from backlit LCD screens (replacing the original cathode-ray tube displays) to enable the use of the newest functionalities, while the new cabin featured larger volume overhead bins, improved lighting and better air and light controls for passengers. A systems upgrade and an even more robust structure completed the picture of an aircraft that had taken a clear step forward while retaining the strengths gained from maturity.



After 2003 approximately €150 million continued to be invested every year, ensuring that operational efficiency and passenger comfort remained as much at the forefront as engine and system upgrades. The family continued to grow during this period too: The A330-200F was launched in 2007 and entered service three years later, Airbus Corporate Jet started to offer their customers A330-200s and the first “Multi-Role-Tanker-Transport” (MRTT) version was delivered in June 2011. The next A330 to be delivered to Airbus Defense & Space for conversion into MRTT, will be the programme’s 50th -- for final operator MMF, a fleet procurement and pooling consortium on behalf of the NATO member air forces.



Nevertheless, the constant push to make the aircraft even better continued, and by 2015 the introduction of the 242 tonne MTOW version with Delta Air Lines in May of that year had brought the A330-300’s range to 6,100nm, along with a two percent fuel burn reduction, a cabin upgrade – which included full LED lighting and the latest IFE – plus new avionics systems and the option to activate the centre section as a fuel tank. All these enhancements ensured that the A330 Family continued to sell well – and be appreciated by over 120 satisfied operators worldwide, who have in total ordered more than 1,800 A330s (all versions) since the start of the programme.



A330neo: Powering into the future



Fast-forward to the present day and the A330neo is now powering the family into the future with its new engine and wing technology to drive a step-change in performance and economics – 25% lower fuel burn and CO2 emissions when compared with the previous generation aircraft. Moreover, by retaining the ‘same type rating’ and having 95% spares commonality it can seamlessly fit into any existing A330 fleet, while its new Airspace cabin offers the perfect space for passengers and airlines. The A330neo also takes real-time health monitoring and predictive maintenance to the next level with Airbus’ advanced Skywise big-data analytics capabilities -- helping to transform unplanned maintenance events into plannable ones so the airline’s flight schedules are not interrupted. In short, with the A330-900 and -800, the A330 Family continues to set the bar for versatility in every business model, being the lowest risk widebody solution for every type of operator carrying from 230 to 460 passengers, on routes from 20 minutes to over 17 hours, and doing so with over 99% reliability.

Airbus delivers first Mobile-made A220 aircraft - AL.com,"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsLmNvbS9uZXdzL21vYmlsZS8yMDIwLzEwL2FpcmJ1cy1kZWxpdmVycy1maXJzdC1tb2JpbGUtbWFkZS1hMjIwLWFpcmNyYWZ0Lmh0bWzSAWpodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbC5jb20vbmV3cy9tb2JpbGUvMjAyMC8xMC9haXJidXMtZGVsaXZlcnMtZmlyc3QtbW9iaWxlLW1hZGUtYTIyMC1haXJjcmFmdC5odG1sP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus Mobile plant unveiled another milestone in its five years of producing airplanes in Alabama: The first delivery of the single-aisle jets called the A220.

The European-based aircraft manufacturer announced Thursday that the first of the U.S.-assembled A220 aircraft, built in Mobile, had been delivered to Delta Air Lines. Airbus is targeting to build four A220-series airplanes per month by the middle of the decade.

“The delivery of the first U.S.-built A220-300 is a historic moment that highlights Airbus' growing industrial footprint in North America and makes us all extremely proud,” said C. Jeffrey Knittel, chairman & CEO of Airbus Americas, Inc. “We look forward to seeing passengers delighted by the experience of traveling on board this brand new A200-300 proudly built in Mobile, Alabama.”

The construction of the A200-family of aircraft adds to the manufacturing in portfolio of aircraft built in Alabama’s Port City since the original $600 million aircraft assembly plant was opened in 2015. Since opening in Mobile, Airbus has used the facility to build more than 180 planes from its other narrow-body family, the A320-series, for U.S. customers. The company estimates that its five-year economic impact on Mobile and Baldwin counties at $1.1 billion, and 12,000 jobs.

The addition of a new $300 million Final Assembly Line will allow Airbus to churn out more of the A220-series planes, while adding onto the sprawling Mobile complex’s footprint: Adding 70 additional acres to the existing 116-acre footprint, and bringing square footage from 736,000 square feet to 1.26 million. The new final assembly plant opened in May, following an 18-month construction project.

In Mobile, the city and county each doled out $400,000 in annual incentive packages for the next decade to support the A220 venture, totaling $4 million. Also, the two governments agreed last year to a 10-year property tax abatement and endorsed construction-related fee waivers.

Airbus said the groundbreaking of the new assembly plant in January 2019, followed up with the official start of production of the A220-series of aircraft in August 2019.

“Handing over the first U.S.-assembled aircraft to a U.S.-based customer is a real point of pride for the A220 program,” said Philippe Balducchi, who leads the A220 program. “This delivery is the first of many to come and shows the strong collaborative spirit between the A200 program teams globally.”

Delta Air Lines is the largest A220 customer, with a total of 95 of the aircraft on order. The airliner will be the first A220 operator in America to operate both A220-100 and A220-300 aircraft types.

JetBlue, according to online reports, is also a large customer for the A200 aircraft, placing a 60-aircraft order for the A220-300 in 2018.

According to the company, at the end of September, 123 A220s had been delivered to seven operators and are being flown on routes in America, Asia, Europe and Africa.

The milestone in Mobile, and continue touting of the A220 production in Alabama, comes during a precarious time for global aerospace manufacturing. The industry, led by Airbus and Boeing, has been hit hard during the coronavirus pandemic. Airbus officials have warned about the prospect of cutting 15,000 jobs worldwide as the pandemic continues to keep air travel at low levels due to fears over flying related to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Airbus spearheads European 'Moonshot' for zero-carbon aviation - Royal Aeronautical Society,"Tue, 06 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm9zb2NpZXR5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1zcGVhcmhlYWRzLWV1cm9wZWFuLW1vb25zaG90LWZvci16ZXJvLWNhcmJvbi1hdmlhdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Liquid hydrogen may blast rockets into outer space, but in 2035 it could be powering a zero carbon airliner if Airbus' ambitious plans to lead the decarbonisation of aviation come to fruition. TIM ROBINSON reports.

Earlier this year, proponents of green aviation were disappointed when Airbus, in conjunction with partner Rolls-Royce, axed its modified BAe 146 hybrid-electric E-FanX demonstrator before it had even flown. Yet, what seemed to be at the time a setback for progress in sustainable aviation has now turned out to be just a small bump in the road to the launchpad of a far more ambitious aim – to develop a zero-carbon airliner by 2035.

One might think that, given the grave existential crisis that aviation currently finds itself in due to the Covid-19 crisis, the pressure from the environmental lobby would have eased and aerospace manufacturers would have a breathing space to focus on just surviving. Yet, ironically, the opposite has happened. With clearer skies, less pollution and better air quality, the mass grounding of the world’s airline fleets has given people a glimpse of what a zero-carbon, cleaner future might be like.

While the world’s airlines are in deep crisis and delaying deliveries of current generation aircraft, some argue that this is the perfect time for the aerospace industry to look even further ahead and rethink and reset itself for a zero-carbon future – ready for when demand returns and the inevitable growth in air travel comes back.

Airbus pivots to hydrogen

The race is on - Airbus plans to choose one of these zero-carbon airliners to launch in 2025. (Airbus)

Indeed, this seems to have informed Airbus’s thinking when, on 21 September, it unveiled three ZEROe concepts for hydrogen-powered airliners, ranging from a regional turboprop, turbofan and a blended-wing body (BWB) design – which it says could be in service by as soon as 2035. Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury described the unveiling as: ""A historic moment for the commercial aviation sector as a whole and we intend to play a leading role in the most important transition this industry has ever seen.

The hydrogen-powered turbofan ZEROe airliner, looking conceptually like a scaled-down A350, would seat 150-200 passengers, with a range of nearly 2,000 miles. Liquid hydrogen would be stored in the rear fuselage. Another ZEROe concept is for a hydrogen-powered turboprop, for 100 passengers and a range of up to 1,000 miles. The final concept is for a 200-seat BWB design, based on the company's Maveric testbed revealed at the start of this year. Range would be approximately 2,000 miles but the volume of the fuselage would open-up multiple options for cabin layout and storage of hydrogen. All these aircraft would use hybrid-electric architectures, leveraging Airbus’ knowledge on E-FanX, with electric motors embedded in the gas turbines and powered by fuel cells.

It is important to note that, while these are CGI concepts, this represents a firm product development plan by the company. Airbus aims to downselect from these three in 2022-23 and officially launch the programme in 2025, ahead of a ten-year plan to bring a zero-carbon airliner into service in 2035. A flight demonstrator programme will also support this effort which Airbus aims to fly before 2025. The company hints that the BWB concept may already have an advantage, says Glenn Llewellyn,Vice President, Zero Emission Aviation, Airbus, speaking at a media roundtable: “We know from our analysis we may achieve a better performance with a more disruptive overall aircraft design. One of the challenges associated with hydrogen is that it has more volume than kerosene per unit of energy and, therefore, the blended wing body flying wing approach is fairly adapted to that"", adding: “the race is on between those different concepts.""

Being this transparent about future product development to rivals, customers and media is highly unusual, as Llewellyn stressed: “It is very unusual for Airbus to be talking about a programme ambition, a commercial aircraft entry into service 10-15 years before we plan to do it. The reason that we're doing it is because we recognise that this programme is not only about Airbus; it's also about driving change in the energy and aviation ecosystem,” adding: “We're here as a call for action, to ask for help, to ask for these companies, these players to join us on this ambition to deliver a zero-emission aircraft. We will not do this on our own and that's probably as significant as the technology challenge”.

This then, is not just an Airbus CGI of sleek future airliners but the company launching a commercial aerospace ‘moonshot’ that has the potential to touch almost every part of civil aviation as we know it.



Moonshot or incremental approach?

Etihad's 787 ecoDemonstrator allows green technology for the short and medium term to be quickly trialed. (Boeing)

Of course, moonshots can go fall short. Concorde, for example, though an engineering masterpiece and aeronautical work of art, never broke through into mainstream success. Airbus' previous 'moonshot', the A380, also offers a cautionary tale of hubris and trying to bend the market to your will. Over at Boeing, the combination of composites and a new outsourced production model almost did for the 787 Dreamliner.

The incremental approach then, can also offer firm advantages getting green technology into service faster. Boeing, for example, has since 2012 test-flown sustainable technology on its annual ecoDemonstrator programme – which sees an in-service airliner modified to trial advances such as drop-in-sustainable aviation fuels, recycled carpets, laminar flow aerodynamics and optimised flight routing. This year it partnered with Etihad Airways to test new technologies on a 787-10 Dreamliner. These included sustainable aviation fuel, quieter landing gear, and the biggest-ever noise research project in partnership with NASA – as well as an anti-Covid19 UV flightdeck disinfectant lamp that is now being fast-tracked into production.

Over the past eight years, one third of ecoDemonstrator sustainable technology projects have already made it into service, with another third still being researched and the last third being judged not ready yet, says Boeing’s Mike Sinnett, Vice President, Product Development. Boeing’s ecoDemonstrator than provides an approach where incremental advances can be quickly tested and adopted.

However, Sinnett was sceptical about Airbus ambitious plan for hydrogen-powered airliners in the next 15 years saying: “I don’t think it’s something that’s right around the corner” and noting the vast experience that the industry and operators had built up with Jet-A1-fuelled airliners over decades.

Nearer than we think

ZeroAvia's first flight and the Jet Zero Council has positioned the UK to play a leading role in zero-carbon aviation revolution. (ZeroAvia)

Yet hydrogen-powered aircraft are now already with us. The same week as Airbus’ announcement also saw a historic aviation milestone in UK skies with the first flight of ZeroAvia’s hydrogen fuel-cell-powered six-seat Piper M demonstrator at Cranfield, UK on 25 September. ""One of the most historic flights in decade's"" said new UK Aviation Minister, Robert Courts, MP of the flight.

This achievement, the first flight of a ‘commercial grade’ hydrogen-powered aircraft is thus a major milestone for zero-emission flight – CEO and founder Val Miftakhov saying: “It’s hard to put into words what this means to our team but also for everybody interested in zero-emission flight. While some experimental aircraft have flown using hydrogen fuel cells as a power source, the size of this commercially available aircraft shows that paying passengers could be boarding a truly zero-emission flight very soon.”

ATI-backed ZeroAvia now plans to demonstrate longer range (200-300nm) flights with the Piper M before the end of the year, before turning their attention to offering its hydrogen powertrain to convert existing 19-seat class aircraft ,such as the Dornier 228 and Cessna SkyCourier, to zero-carbon flight in the next three to four years. With the ZeroAvia aiming its powerplant to be in ubiquitous PT6 turboprop-class, it could have wide applications.

Even though this six-seater is at the small end of the zero-carbon scale compared to Airbus’ plans, Miftakhov reveals that it is already attracted big commercial interest with over 30 discussions with operators, ten letters of interest (LoI) and seven discussions with aircraft OEMs.

Thinking further out of the box

Airlander's massive volume may make it ideal to adapt to hydrogen propulsion. (Hybrid Air Vehicles)

Finally, there may be even more radical ideas to harness hydogen as a potential zero-carbon aviation fuel. Earlier this year, ex-Airbus and UTC Chief Technology Officer, Paul Eremenko, revealed his latest project – Universal Hydrogen, which aims to turn hydrogen into separate mini-fuel cell tanks that could be loaded onto aircraft, cargo container-style, removing the need for cyrogenic refuelling at airports. Universal Hydrogen aims to have its technology ready by 2024.

Meanwhile hybrid-airship specialists Hybrid Air Vehicles is already working on a future electric version of its Airlander airship, in partnership with Collins. CEO Tom Gundy also notes that Airlander could be perfect for pulling through new green technologies like these – as the airship already gives a 70% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to conventional aircraft. With a hydro-electric configuration this would increase to a 90% reduction and 100% with an all-electric power. Perhaps most interesting of all, the giant internal volume of airships would potentially allow for easier storage of hydrogen than conventional wings and tube airliners where, as the volume of hydrogen increases, so does the drag. HAV is now proposing that Airlander could find a new role as a point-to-point 90-seat regional aircraft – with ‘fast ferry’ style speeds as the world shifts to a zero-carbon future.

However, like hydrogen-powered airliners and electric flight, widespread adoption of airships as regional transports will need big changes and adjustments in flight operating procedures, infrastructure and customer expectations. Will passengers accept flying slower (in the case of electric/hybrid-electric aircraft and airships) but greener in the future?



Challenges

The byproduct of burning hydrogen would be water vapour - which would still cause contrails (NASA)

In order for the commercial aviation to pivot to hydrogen, there still remain significant challenges – both a technical standpoint and from logistics and scaling up this alternative fuel. Some critics also point out that, while hydrogen is 'zero-carbon', burning it as a fuel is not zero-emission – it does produces NOX and water vapour. Water vapour may seem harmless but can contribute to the formation of contrails and radiative forcing which is linked with climate change and the greenhouse effect. Water vapour contrails then may have to be paired with advanced air traffic management to steer clear of contrail formation areas. Research done by the Royal Aeronautical Society's Greener By Design Group suggests that this could be quite easily achieved with today’s space-based real-time weather surveillance and with minimal operational and economic impact on airlines. Tactical military aircraft already avoid the contrail layer if possible to prevent giving away their position to enemies within visual range – could civil airliners do the same?

There is also the issue that hydrogen may not scale well – unlike kerosene fuel. Paradoxically, the bigger the aircraft, the more weight and volume that cryogenic tanks for liquid hydrogen and its associated systems take up – undermining seat-mile economics. It may be then that A320-sized aircraft with a range of 1,500-2,000nm could be the upper limit, before the cryogenic fuel tank weight and volume (and thus drag) spirals up and makes it unprofitable. Says Llewellyn: “With the technology that we are targeting for 2035, we see that sort of passenger number, 200, maybe a bit more, being the upper limit for the technology. We expect that subsequent generations of hydrogen-powered aircraft could potentially start moving upwards of 200 passengers but probably not for the first iteration of large commercial hydrogen aircraft.” Sustainable aviation fuels (whether biofuels or synthetic E-fuels) will thus still have a part to play.

Another factor to consider is how the hydrogen is made. A true-zero-carbon supply chain would see the 'green hydrogen' produced by renewable energy – such as wind or solar power. However, that still remains a fraction of energy consumed. 'Grey hydrogen', with the fuel produced by electricity from coal, oil or gas power then might have to do for the forseeable future but can that be called fully zero-carbon? However, there is cause for positivity here for, as Llewellyn notes, the economics of renewables are shifting fast: “What we already see in 2020 is the beginning of exponential growth in terms of those energy production methods that is driven primarily by the fact that the cost of those production methods have gone down significantly over the last few years.”

There is also the immense logistics, infrastructure and supply chain aspect of introducing a whole new fuel – as one person once described it: 'turning Heathrow into Cape Caneveral'. Airports would need to be upgraded all around the world, with cryogenic fuel supply and storage on a scale that is difficult to fathom – especially if narrowbody aircraft, which make up the bulk of the airliners in the world‘s fleet, will be the first to be converted to hydrogen. It is also worth pointing out that that this will also include those airports where hydrogen-powered aircraft might have to divert to as well.

Finally, there is the certification aspect. Recent events have shown in stark detail what happens when an aviation regulator is gutted of expertise and companies practise self-regulation. It is thus clear that, for a new fuel and propulsion system, and with the public’s, politicians’ and media’s minds jumping to the Hindenberg whenever hydrogen and flight are mentioned, that regulators will need to be ultra-cautious when approaching certification.

There are thus significant challenges – both from a technical standpoint and the logistics. However, these are not insurmountable.

Summary

A clean slate? The Cobid19 crisis has opened up the opportunity for aviation to reinvent itself as a zero-carbon form of transport. (Airbus)

Make no mistake – this is a gigantic undertaking which Airbus itself admits it cannot hope to achieve by itself – commercial aviation’s equvailent of the Apollo Lunar programme. Even the introduction of the jet age in the 1950s perhaps was not as significant, as jets had been in service since WW2 and fuel was still oil-based. Hydrogen and the related electrification of aviation will thus need support and buy in across multiple stakeholders and sectors, from airlines to energy producers. It will also require understanding and education on the part of consumers, the media and politicians as the limits on certain types of technology and how zero-carbon air travel could alter traditional business models and passenger experience. For example, would communities near small airfields welcome a huge increase in movements of electric or hydrogen-powered commuter aircraft if that would facilitate cheap, zero-carbon point-to-point travel?

What is different this time around is that the push for this new greener technology is coming from society itself, rather than as a side-effect of ever more efficient engines, lighter materials and reduced drag that aviation engineers have always aimed for since the Wright brothers first flew.

There is thus a huge opportunity for the aviation industry, which has been fighting a rearguard action in trying to convince policymakers it is serious about reducing its carbon footprint, to embrace this wholeheartedly and run with it.

In the UK, zero-carbon aviation has been given a high priority, with the formation of the industry/government JetZero Council partnership to focus and help channel development in this area with the goal of zero-emission transatlantic flight in a generation. This is also a priority elsewhere in Europe – with the French Government’s €15bn bailout to the aerospace and aviation sector coming with the understanding that sustainable green projects should be fast-tracked.

This then represents a huge opportunity to reset the sector that will allow people to travel again, guilt-free, and airlines to grow, while massively reducing the impact on our planet. Airbus’ Llewellyn says: “In very simple terms, there's no other way for society to meet the Paris Agreement climate commitment without hydrogen. Hydrogen is here with us to stay, and it's something that will have infrastructure developed for it, will have a reducing cost curve, and we are sure that aviation needs to be positioned to take advantage of that.“

In the end, if aviation is to meet the challenge of sustainable green growth, then this is a moonshot worth aiming for.

“With 94 aircraft in service, the A400M is increasingly becoming the air mobility backbone of our customers, both in civil and military environments, as seen in recent Covid-19 crisis missions around the globe.”

The Airbus A400M is primarily designed to carry strategic loads to tactical locations.

Recently, it achieved additional capabilities including simultaneous paratrooper dispatch for a maximum of 116 paratroopers using the side doors, automatic low level flight in visual meteorological conditions and aerial delivery and combat off-load via parachute extraction.

The aircraft has a range of 8,900km and can be used to carry paratroopers, heavy vehicles, equipment and other cargo. It is capable of carrying payloads of up to 37t.

In August, the British Royal Air Force (RAF) deployed an Airbus A400M aircraft to support border patrol operations."
EASA approves increased take-off weight variant of the A330-900 - Airbus,"Thu, 08 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIwLTEwLWVhc2EtYXBwcm92ZXMtaW5jcmVhc2VkLXRha2Utb2ZmLXdlaWdodC12YXJpYW50LW9mLXRoZS1hMzMwLTkwMNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has achieved certification from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) for its latest A330neo product enhancement enabling longer range: the 251 metric tonne Maximum-Take-Off Weight (MTOW) variant of the A330-900. With more range and even better economics, the new variant now offers a significant 650-nautical mile boost in range – or six tonnes more payload – when compared with the A330-900’s current 242-tonne version.

This increase in range responds to evolving market needs, enabling airlines to benefit from the unique economics of the A330neo for even longer missions – flying efficiently on routes from 20mn to over 17 hours. It also means that now the A330neo Family offers airlines even more flexibility with a wide range of certified MTOW options, ranging from 200 to 251 tonnes. Corsair will be the first airline to operate this most capable A330neo. With this new A330-900 offering, operators will have the necessary range and capacity to capitalize on longer routes while rationalising their fleets.



François Kubica, A330 Chief Engineer says: “Airbus is always supporting its customers to find solutions by advancing our products. With the new 251 tonne weight variant the A330neo is more flexible than ever to meet their current and future requirements.”



Overall, the new MTOW option makes the A330-900 the perfect fit for longer trans-Pacific or Asia-Europe routes. The -900 is the longer-fuselage A330neo version, seating 260-300 passengers in a typical three-class cabin configuration. Certification at the new 251 tonne weight for the shorter-fuselage A330-800 – which accommodates 220-260 passengers in a three-class configuration – will take place next year to enable airlines to open up even longer range transpacific routes while delivering the lowest seat-mile cost in its category.



To achieve the 251t capability, Airbus has retained 99% spares commonality, with the MTOW increase achieved through a combination of weight-neutral structural reinforcements and landing gear adaptations. Modifications to the nose and main landing gear have also enabled Airbus engineers to extend their time-before-overhaul (TBO), prolonging the previous 10-year interval to a new 12-year timeframe, thus resulting in significant maintenance savings.



A330neo is now powering the family into the future with its new engine and wing technology to drive a step-change in performance and economics – 25% lower fuel burn and CO2 emissions when compared with the previous generation aircraft. Moreover, by retaining the ‘same type rating’ and having 95% spares commonality, it can seamlessly fit into any existing A330 fleet, while its new Airspace cabin offers the perfect space for passengers and airlines.

Airbus To Develop Aviation Fuel Cells With ElringKlinger - Aviation Week,"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9hZXJvc3BhY2UvYWlyY3JhZnQtcHJvcHVsc2lvbi9haXJidXMtZGV2ZWxvcC1hdmlhdGlvbi1mdWVsLWNlbGxzLWVscmluZ2tsaW5nZXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has formed a joint company with German automotive fuel-cell supplier ElringKlinger to develop technology for zero-emission, hydrogen-fueled aircraft.

The partnership will develop aviation-compatible fuel-cell stacks, beginning with the delivery this year of stacks and a customized test rig.

ElringKlinger will have a non-controlling interest in the newly established joint company, it said in a statement, while Airbus will hold the majority stake. ElringKlinger will provide technology relevant to hydrogen fuel cells in return for “compensation in the low-to-mid double-digit million euro range.”

Airbus has committed to bringing a zero-emission commercial aircraft to market by 2035 and is studying three concepts for airliners that would use liquid hydrogen in a combination of direct combustion in turbine engines and electrical generation in fuel cells.

ElringKlinger said it was selected by Airbus after it had conducted an extensive analysis of the international fuel-cell market. The company supplied fuel-cell stacks for testing as part of a pre-contractual phase and these exceeded the target power density by 15%, it said.

In a proton exchange membrane fuel cell, hydrogen flows into the stack and onto the anode, where it is split into hydrogen ions and electrons. Ions permeate across the membrane to the cathode, while electrons flow through an external circuit and generate power. Oxygen, in the form of air, is supplied to the cathode, where it combines with the hydrogen ions and electrons to produce water.

ElringKlinger says the key to the high power-density of its stack is the use of metallic bipolar plates and specially designed membrane electrode assembly sealing. Bipolar plates distribute the hydrogen gas and air, conduct electrical current from cell to cell, remove heat from the active area, and prevent leakage of gases and coolant. They significantly contribute to the volume, weight and cost of fuel-cell stacks.

The aviation industry is tapping the automotive market as it looks to fuel cells to enable zero-emission flight. Under the UK government-funded HyFlyer project, startup ZeroAvia is working with Intelligent Energy to optimize its high-power fuel cells for small, medium-range passenger aircraft.

Another startup, Universal Hydrogen, has selected automotive fuel-cell developer Plug Power to develop a 2-megawatt power system for its conversion of the De Havilland Canada Dash-800 regional turboprop, and potentially the ATR 42, to hydrogen propulsion.

ACJ TwoTwenty versus Gulfstream G700 versus Bombardier G7500 - Corporate Jet Investor,"Tue, 06 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvcnBvcmF0ZWpldGludmVzdG9yLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Fjai10d290d2VudHktdmVyc3VzLWd1bGZzdHJlYW0tZzcwMC12ZXJzdXMtYm9tYmFyZGllci1nNzUwMC01MTkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ACJ TwoTwenty versus Gulfstream G700 versus Bombardier G7500

news by CJI Expert October 6, 2020 Print this page

It is important to start with some disclaimers. First, it is unfair to compare paper planes with ones that have been delivered.

Until an aircraft is flown by a customer, you are right to be sceptical about manufacturer claims. Airlines are already operating A220 aircraft, but the ACJ TwoTwenty has significant modifications – including five auxiliary fuel tanks.

Conversely, Gulfstream has announced a maximum range of 7,500nm (13,890km) for the G700. Gulfstream has a great habit of delivering aircraft that fly further than first promised. Manufacturers also upgrade aircraft, so, we decided to compare a 2020 Global 7500 with two aircraft expected to be delivered in 2023.

The second disclaimer is that even if the ACJ TwoTwenty is designed to compete with the ultra-long-range aircraft, it is a very different option. The ACJ TwoTwenty is a Bentley or Rolls-Royce, while the Gulfstream is a Ferrari, and the Bombardier a Porsche.

But it is fascinating to see how Airbus’s entrant into this new market segment, the Xtra Large Bizjet, competes with two flagship ultra-long-range aircraft.

Range

-ACJ TwoTwenty: 5,650nms (10,500kms)

-Bombardier Global 7500: 7,700nms (14,260kms)

-Gulfstream G700: 7,500nms (13,890 kms).

On paper this is an easy win for Bombardier and Gulfstream (and we are pretty sure that Gulfstream will add to the range), but very few of these models will ever fly this far. Unless you have a specific route you regularly fly, more than 5,500nm is still enough.

The ACJ TwoTwenty can fly directly between London and Los Angeles, Moscow and Jakarta, Tokyo and Dubai or Beijing and Melbourne.

If you were trying to fly between London and Sydney, for example, you could refuel just once. In fact, you would need to do that anyway for all three.

One thing worth remembering is that to fly maximum range you are spending a lot of time in the aircraft. The ACJ TwoTwenty will fly you for more than 12 hours and Airbus will argue that passengers would prefer extra space. The G700 and Global 7500 are faster though.

Max speed

-ACJ TwoTwenty: Mach 0.82 (629mph)

-Bombardier Global 7500: Mach 0.925 (710mph)

-Gulfstream G700: Mach 0.925 (710mph).

Both the ultra-long-range jets are 12% faster. Time-pressured CEOs may find this a strong argument. However, to fly longer ranges both the Gulfstream and Bombardier typically fly at Mach 0.85.

Runways

Take-off distance

-ACJ TwoTwenty: 5,249ft (1,600m)

-Bombardier Global 7500: 5,800 ft (1,768m)

-Gulfstream G700: 6250 ft (1,905m).

All these figures are truly impressive, and it is worth remembering that the Global and G700 have a longer range. But it does mean that most significant airports will be open to the ACJ TwoTwenty. In fact, the airline version the A220-100 is the largest aircraft able to operate in the constrained environment of London City Airport. The Global 7500 can also fly out of London City – in March 2019 one flew direct to Los Angeles. And you would bet on the Gulfstream G700 achieving this.

Price

-ACJ TwoTwenty: $70 – $81.5m

-Bombardier Global 7500: $72.8m

-Gulfstream G700: $76m.

Although Airbus has not announced a fixed price for the TwoTwenty, Benoit Defforge, President, ACJ, told Corporate Jet Investor that the “price would be just below the high end of the ultra-long-range offer”, which means under $80m.

Connectivity

-ACJ TwoTwenty: Ku

-Bombardier Global 7500: Ka

-Gulfstream G700: Ka.

All three have great connectivity. But size is an advantage – it allows aircraft to have larger tail mounted antennae. ACJ says that the TwoTwenty connection will be twice as fast as competitors.

Passengers

-ACJ TwoTwenty: < 18

-Bombardier Global 7500: <19

-Gulfstream G700: <19.

All three aircraft are designed up to 18 or 19 passengers. Although, in reality, most flights will have fewer passengers. The ACJ TwoTwenty figure is a little misleading as the Airbus A220-100 airline version is designed for between 100 and 130 passengers.

Cabin Width

-ACJ TwoTwenty: 10ft 7 in/ 3.28m

-Bombardier Global 7500: 8ft 0in

-Gulfstream G700: 8ft 2in.

Cabin Length

-ACJ TwoTwenty: 77ft 7in

-Bombardier Global 7500: 54 ft 5in

-Gulfstream G700: 63ft 8in.

Verdict

All three are fantastic aircraft and a lot of choice will come down to relationship and personal preference. However, compared with ultra-long-range jets, the ACJ TwoTwenty offers transcontinental range with a large cabin at a competitive price. It will be fascinating to see how the market will respond to what Defforge termed this new category in the market: “The extra-large business jet.”"
"American retires last Airbus A330, goes all-Boeing for wide-body jets - The Points Guy","Thu, 22 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2FtZXJpY2FuLWFpcmxpbmVzLXJldGlyZXMtYWlyYnVzLWEzMzBzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The changes to American Airlines fleet continue as the coronavirus pandemic resets flying.

The Fort Worth, Texas-based carrier has retired its 15 Airbus A330-200s, officially making it an all-Boeing wide-body operator of 777s and 787s, American said Thursday. The A330s have been in long-term storage since May.

The move brings the number of jets retired by American to 114 during the pandemic. Gone are its Airbus A330s — both the -200s and -300s — Boeing 757s and 767s and Embraer E190s, as well as the Bombardier CRJ200s flown by its regional affiliates.

""We now only have for aircraft types in our mainline fleet,"" said American chief financial officer Derek Kerr during a quarterly earnings call on Thursday. ""The operating efficiencies on the crew, maintenance and schedule are permanent.""

Kerr added that the aircraft retirements ""accelerated"" the airline's long-term fleet plans. American's mainline operations now consist of Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 family narrow-bodies and 777 and 787 family wide-bodies.

In a report Thursday, Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth estimated that American has removed roughly 10% of the seats it flew in 2019 with the A330 retirements. Delta Air Lines has removed roughly 22% of 2019 seats and United Airlines none having not officially retired any jets.

American is due to take delivery of around 39 new mainline jets in 2021 after reaching an agreement with Boeing to defer up to eight 737 MAX deliveries. The new planes include 16 A321neos, 10 737 MAX 8s and 13 787s. All of the new aircraft have financing commitments in place, Kerr said.

The fleet changes come as American posted a $2.4 billion net loss in the third quarter. The critical cash burn measure — or how much it loses on a daily basis — averaged $44 million a day during the three months ending in September.

The airline's daily losses are far higher than those at its competitors. Southwest Airlines achieved a burn of just $16 million a day, Delta Air Lines $24 million and United Airlines $21 million in the third quarter. However, each airline calculates the burn rate differently making direct comparisons difficult.

American hopes to reduce daily cash burn to $25 million to $30 million in the fourth quarter that ends in December.

Airbus celebrates success of ACH130 Aston Martin Edition - Vertical Magazine,"Thu, 08 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FjaDEzMC1hc3Rvbi1tYXJ0aW4tZWRpdGlvbi1oZWxpY29wdGVyLXdpbnMtb3JkZXJzLWFjcm9zcy10aGUtd29ybGQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The ACH130 Aston Martin Edition is a stylish special version of the ACH130 featuring a range of interior and exterior designs created by Aston Martin.

Customers on three continents have signed firm contracts for the Airbus ACH130 Aston Martin Edition helicopter since its launch earlier this year.

The helicopter, one of the most distinctive sights in the skies, will enter service in Latin America, North America and Asia Pacific over the coming months.

Launched in January, the ACH130 Aston Martin Edition is a stylish special version of the ACH130 featuring a range of interior and exterior designs created by Aston Martin to delight helicopter owners who appreciate the thrill of piloting and the pleasure of driving luxury sports cars.

The first example of this exceptional model in Asia Pacific has been ordered by an existing Airbus customer in New Zealand. It will be used privately as well as on VIP charter operations.

In Latin America the ACH130 Aston Martin Edition has just entered service with an undisclosed VIP customer in Guatemala.

Most recently another undisclosed private customer in Canada has ordered the third example, which will be completed by skilled craftsmen and women in the United Kingdom, where Airbus manages and engineers this edition, and finally delivered from the Airbus Customer Centre in Fort Erie, Canada.

The aeronautical designers at Airbus Corporate Helicopters (ACH) and the automotive designers at Aston Martin worked closely together for over a year, marrying ACH’s key values of excellence, quality and service with Aston Martin’s commitment to beauty, handcrafting and automotive art to bring a new level of aesthetics and rigorous attention to detail to the single-engine helicopter market.

Frédéric Lemos, head of ACH, said: “We are delighted with the market reaction to this superb new helicopter. These orders across the world, clearly demonstrate the excitement generated by our collaboration with Aston Martin.”"
Will Any Boeing And Airbus Tier 1 And 2 Suppliers Go Bankrupt? - Aviation Week,"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9hZXJvc3BhY2UvbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy1zdXBwbHktY2hhaW4vd2lsbC1hbnktYm9laW5nLWFpcmJ1cy10aWVyLTEtMi1zdXBwbGllcnMtZ28tYmFua3J1cHTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ask the Editors: The Aviation Week Network invites our readers to submit questions to our editors and analysts. We’ll answer them, and if we can’t we’ll reach out to our wide network of experts for advice.

Do you foresee bankruptcies with any major Tier 1 and Tier 2 producers for Boeing and Airbus?

Michael Bruno, Aviation Week’s Senior Business Editor, responds:

A flurry of news in late September and early October illustrated some of the realities of the worst aerospace downturn since the dawn of the Jet Age. In the span of days:​​​​

• Impresa Aerospace, a supplier to OEMs and Tier 1 military and commercial aircraft manufacturers, entered U.S. bankruptcy protection and said it could be taken over by its predominant private equity owner, Twin Haven Capital Partners;

• Aerostructures giant Spirit AeroSystems formally walked away from its two-year-long effort to acquire Belgian aerospace supplier Asco Industries;

• Aero engine supplier Whitcraft Group announced it would auction newly acquired plants across the U.S. as part of a retrenchment effort;

• Word emerged that the embattled Triumph Group was fielding takeover interest from suitors, reportedly including serial aerospace and defense acquirer TransDigm Group; and

• Boeing leaked plans to scrap its Enterprise Operations division.

A new wave of consolidation and contraction in the A&D sector has arrived in earnest due to COVID-19. To answer the first question: Yes, bankruptcies are foreseeable in the lower tiers of the supply chain (as Impresa’s case already demonstrates). The question of how many more could occur is answered by another question: Does it matter whether it is bankruptcy? Insolvency is likely to be just one process by which up to 20% of lower-tier suppliers exit the industry in coming years, according to estimates from aerospace analysts and advisors.

Can the supply chain handle the exits of these lower-tier suppliers, especially if there are further monthly production rate reductions? In a nutshell, it has to, but success is not guaranteed. Aerospace analysts note that the larger automotive industry has gone through the same degree of consolidation before, particularly after the 2008 Great Recession, and enjoyed a revival before the pandemic. However, automotive has faced existential crises since the 1980s that required government, labor and management to reach compromises, but such a grand bargain for A&D may be a ways off as industry largely still appears to be working through the first, liquidity-oriented stage of crisis response to COVID-19.

Aerospace manufacturing long ago stopped being an industry where a greater number of smaller suppliers are created from whole cloth. Instead, the story this century has been about slow but steady consolidation due to OEM and Tier 1 supply chain squeezes, the dearth of new programs, technological and workforce challenges associated with ramping up production, and exogenous shocks such as 9/11, the 2008 financial crisis and now the novel coronavirus. What is more, in the recent super-cycle of commercial aviation, mergers and acquisitions were driven less by capacity needs and more by access to programs or control of proprietary processes or parts. This is expected to continue and accelerate post-pandemic.

OEMs and Tier 1s are working to buttress suppliers, but—as might be expected—they are working with their largest and most important providers first. In turn, each is expected to oversee their own supply chains. Before the COVID-19 outbreak, consultants said OEMs and Tier 1s never enjoyed deep insight into their supplier bases. And since crises tend to draw attention inward, insight is not expected to improve soon either. On top of that, OEMs and major suppliers are not in the business of financially supporting smaller players. Indeed, outsourcing cost and risk has become an integral part of modern aero management DNA. Instead, Boeing offers to facilitate talks with its own financial supporters to help with any key supplier who needs near-term liquidity support, top executives say.

“The supply chain is in an every-man-for-himself-situation because the OEMs are exhausted,” says Bryan Perkins, founder & CEO of Novaria Group.

The good news is, as Boeing’s new Commercial Market Outlook attests, confidence is high over the long-term prospects of commercial air traffic and demand for aircraft manufacturing. The challenge will be bridging the gap between now and the end of the forecast’s 20-year outlook. Survival of the A&D industry is widely expected, and private investors are already poring over potential opportunities to get in on at a relatively low entry point. But the survival of any brand or factory is not a given, and much remains to be determined.

CLARIFICATION: Impresa is the only company referenced here that has filed for bankruptcy protection. Others are listed as examples of industry’s response to the downturn.

Will Airbus Pull Work Back To Europe From Abroad? - Aviation Week,"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9hZXJvc3BhY2UvbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy1zdXBwbHktY2hhaW4vd2lsbC1haXJidXMtcHVsbC13b3JrLWJhY2stZXVyb3BlLWFicm9hZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ask the Editors: The Aviation Week Network invites our readers to submit questions to our editors and analysts. We’ll answer them, and if we can’t we’ll reach out to our wide network of experts for advice.

Do you believe the economic slowdown could result in Airbus pulling work back into Europe from other regions of the world?

Jens Flottau, Aviation Week’s Executive Editor, Commercial Aviation, answers:

Airbus made the strategic decision to broaden its geographical base of mainly final assembly lines in the early 2000s. The final assembly line in Tianjin, China, opened in 2008, followed by a similar site in Mobile, Alabama, in 2015. The reason for the moves was largely political: The company’s senior management believed that having a prominent industrial footprint in China would promote sales in one of the fastest growing and biggest air transport markets. Sales figures appear to prove that the assumption was accurate.

The same is true for Mobile. Like Tianjin, the site is not necessarily more cost effective than Hamburg, Germany, or Toulouse, France, mainly because the logistics are more complicated in terms of shipping parts across the world. But it was seen as a means to increase Airbus’ market share with U.S. airlines. The carriers could argue that they are “buying American” even though the aircraft they are ordering are made by Airbus. Mobile also plays a key role to get around U.S. imposed tariffs for aircraft imports and now also produces the A220.

Consolidating production in fewer places generally makes sense, particularly in a dramatic downturn such as the current one. Were it not for the strategic rationale, some of the sites would surely be at risk, particularly the low-volume split A220 line, which ironically is currently a bigger issue for the main site in Mirabel, Canada. But no indications suggest that the current Airbus management under CEO Guillaume Faury is coming to different conclusions than its predecessors. If anything, the expectation is for market growth to shift further to Asia-Pacific in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, therefore underlining the need for an industrial presence in the region.

The bigger unknown is not the economic slowdown but worsening trade and political relations with China, which could ultimately change the picture, at least for Airbus’ footprint in that country."

Satair, an Airbus services company, has provided one of its airline customers in the US with what it reports is the “first certified metal printed flying spare part” – a wingtip fence for the A320ceo. The part was no longer procurable from the original supplier, and by using metal Additive Manufacturing to replace it, the company has been able to reduce the likelihood of the aircraft being grounded.

Satair is a standalone Airbus subsidiary and part of the Airbus Customer Services unit, and operates from ten locations worldwide. The company offers full-lifecycle aircraft support with a portfolio of material management products, services, and support modules across all platforms.

The A320ceo’s wingtip fences are installed in four different versions – starboard, port, upper and lower. According to Satair, the original spare parts supplier had difficulties providing the cast part, leading to a regular loss of the moulds and resulting in a potentially high investment cost for Satair to replace the moulds for individual orders. The company studied other conventional options to replace the part, such as redesigning it for machining technology, but the resulting cost and lead-time implications were not competitive.

Felix Hammerschmidt, Satair’s HO Additive Manufacturing, explained, “We received an order for replacement parts and our AOG [Aircraft on Ground] procurement department turned to the Additive Manufacturing team for a solution. After a short pre-assessment, the part was handed over to the RapidSpares design offices at Airbus.”

“Using a new certification process, they were able to re-certify the former cast part within five weeks and adapt it to titanium, which is a qualified airworthy Additive Manufacturing material,” he continued. “The lead time for certification is expected to reduce even further in the future once the technology becomes more of a standard.”

The wingtip fence parts were additively manufactured at the Reference Manufacturing shop in Airbus Filton, which was process qualified in 2019 and is now able to produce airworthy parts regularly. Four parts (full shipset for one aircraft) were built simultaneously in a twenty-six hour build job, reducing the cost per piece and the build time per part.

After Additive Manufacturing, the part required post-processing to become an airworthy part, making it a one-to-one replacement for the original part whilst meeting the same safety requirements as the conventional part. The new AM part is supplied with an EASA Form 1 certification approval.

The shipset was delivered earlier this year – making the airline the first operator with an Airbus metal additively manufactured AM spare part. Compared to conventional solutions, total non-recurring costs were said to have been reduced by 45%, making it a cheaper solution for customers, as well as reducing the total lead time.

Bart Reijnen, CEO of Satair, stated, “Satair is leading the way in providing additive manufactured parts for the aviation aftermarket and we currently have more than 300 part numbers certified for the technology covering every Airbus aircraft family type including tools and Ground Support Equipment.”

“With more than 7,000 A320ceo Family aircraft in service worldwide, the demand for this specific additive manufactured part is likely to increase and with this Additive Manufacturing supply chain now in place, we will be able to produce these parts within a shorter lead-time,” he added. “Four more customers have already requested that same part following this successful delivery.”

“We have already identified more titanium parts for which Additive Manufacturing could as well become a more economical way of production, with higher flexibility and shorter lead times,” he concluded.

This $14 million Airbus Helicopter Just Might Be the Ultimate Luxury Chopper - Maxim,"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1heGltLmNvbS9yaWRlcy93aHktdGhlLTE0LW1pbGxpb24tYWlyYnVzLWFjaDE2MC1leGNsdXNpdmUtaXMtcmV2b2x1dGlvbmFyeS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This $14 million Airbus Helicopter Just Might Be the Ultimate Luxury Chopper

The ACH160 Exclusive Edition was created in collaboration with award-winning superyacht design studio Harrison Eidsgaard.

It’s long been the goal of rotary-wing aviation companies looking to get a lock on the most lucrative end of the market and design a helicopter that can equal the business jet experience, in all respects. With the new ACH160, and in particular its ACH Exclusive edition, Airbus, the premier global aerospace corporation, has hit the mark.

Innovation is built into the DNA of the ACH160, which can transport from four to ten passengers in pure luxury, with a myriad of configuration and customization options. Airbus took out no fewer than 68 patents for this single helicopter, which was created in collaboration with award-winning UK superyacht design studio Harrison Eidsgaard.

The starting price for the ACH160 in basic trim is about $14 million; but the sky is literally the limit for those who want truly one-of-a-kind whirlybirds. With U.S. deliveries due to begin later this year, it’s the most important aircraft to be launched under the Airbus Corporate Helicopters banner, which the company debuted last year.

Its Blue Edge five-bladed main rotor and an additional canted Fenestron rotor, are paired with state-of-the-art Safran turboshaft engines delivering a cruising speed of 172.6 mph and a range of 512 miles, for an unparalleled flying experience along with fuel efficiency and low noise levels.

“The ACH160 is our newest helicopter, and is set to be the reference for innovation, comfort and style in the skies,” Frederic Lemos, head of Airbus Corporate Helicopters, tells Maxim. “Designed for a remarkable flight experience, the ACH160 combines a sleek, agile and modern airframe with the highest levels of comfort, versatile interior configurations and attention to detail—making it the right fit for any adventure you’re ready to take it on…. A few billionaires are already designing their future superyachts with a certified helideck to accommodate an ACH160.”

Lemos says that the key word in private and business aviation these days is “flexibility,” with “some clients looking for the ultimate in luxury with the finest interior finishings, elegant styling and a roomy, comfortable cabin; while some need a first-class utility partner where they can carry their family, pets, mountain bikes, skis, and equipment and land in a faraway spot for a weekend retreat. The beauty of the ACH160 is that it’s the perfect vehicle for both such missions – from the ultimate VIP experience to the most versatile holiday tool.”

https://www.instagram.com/p/CFMmQlpgf5q

One could be forgiven for being distracted by the panoramic views the cabin offers by the sumptuous ACH160 Exclusive’s interiors, including hand-stitched leather upholstery, grain-matched veneers, and other woodwork with as many as eight coats of varnish. This level of bespoke craftsmanship may be common in the world of private jets, but it’s relatively new to the helicopter market. As Airbus says, the interior “offers everything but compromise.”

As Ben Bridge, Executive Vice President Global Business at Airbus Helicopters, puts it, the ACH160 is not only going to win the hearts and budgets of executives and VIPs, but will in fact “revolutionize the way our private and business aviation customers travel.”

Airbus & ElringKlinger launch fuel cell aircraft partnership | electrive.com - www.electrive.com,"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsZWN0cml2ZS5jb20vMjAyMC8xMC8xNS9haXJidXMtZWxyaW5na2xpbmdlci1sYXVuY2gtZnVlbC1jZWxsLXBhcnRuZXJzaGlwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ElringKlinger has signed an agreement with Airbus on a long-term partnership within the field of fuel cell technology. To this end, the supplier and the aviation group intend to set up a joint venture.

Following the delivery of stacks and an individually designed test rig in the summer, the agreement now reached includes a new joint venture to be established, which will initially develop and validate aviation-compatible fuel cell stacks over the coming years. ElringKlinger announced this.

The German supplier will hold a minority stake, while Airbus will hold the majority of shares in the new company. ElringKlinger will provide the new company with access to technology and will supply the components required for the development. The company will receive “compensation in the low to mid-double-digit million euro range” for the closing, which is scheduled for the end of 2020, according to the announcement. Details of this are to be provided in the 2020 Annual Report of ElringKlinger AG.

In the run-up to the agreement, Airbus had conducted extensive analysis within the market for fuel cell stacks. As part of this international selection process, ElringKlinger was able to convince their contracting partner “The high power density of its stacks and its extensive expertise concerning industrialization processes, proved key differentiators.”

“The fact that Airbus opted in favour of ElringKlinger as a technology partner points to the performance capabilities of our fuel cell technology,” says CEO Stefan Wolf. “In the aviation industry, in particular, the power density of stacks is of primary importance. At the same time, other high-tech performance criteria such as service life or operational parameters such as operating temperature or operating humidity must be met in an aviation-specific manner.”

According to the company, the core of the high power density of the ElringKlinger stack is the use of metallic bipolar plates as well as specially designed membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) sealing solutions. According to ElringKlinger, the company has been researching fuel cells for around 20 years and has since then acted both as a system and component supplier. CEO Wolf attests to the “great market potential” of this technology within the aviation industry, as a pure battery drive system quickly reaches its limits in certain applications.

Airbus is relying on hydrogen as a key technology to develop zero-emission aircraft for the commercial market by 2035. To this end, Airbus is testing and researching a wide range of configurations and technology variants for the use of hydrogen, including in conjunction with the use of fuel cells to generate electrical energy.

At Airbus there was a change in strategy this year: The ‘E-Fan X’ project, which was launched in 2017 and aimed at a 100-seat regional aircraft with a hybrid-electric drive, was discontinued in May. Instead, the Group presented three concepts for the world’s first emission-free commercial aircraft in September. All of these concepts, codenamed ‘ZEROe’, rely on hydrogen as the main energy source, but each follows a different approach.

Airbus Unveils ACJ TwoTwenty - Aviation Week,"Tue, 06 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy1hdmlhdGlvbi9haXJidXMtdW52ZWlscy1hY2otdHdvdHdlbnR50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus on Oct. 6 unveiled the latest in its family of corporate business jets, the A220-based ACJ TwoTwenty, with orders for six aircraft.

The launch customer is Comlux Aviation for two aircraft, with undisclosed customers taking the next four. Comlux, a long-term Airbus customer, operator, completions center and now Airbus partner, will outfit the first 15 aircraft in a dedicated ACJ TwoTwenty center at its Indianapolis complex.

The first completed aircraft will enter service in early 2023, Comlux Executive Chairman and CEO Richard Gaona says.

The market has long anticipated an ACJ220. Now, with passengers staying away from the airlines and wealthy individuals and corporations turning to private aviation, A220s are available from the production lines.

Airbus claims the ACJ TwoTwenty creates a new class of executive aircraft: the Xtra Large Bizjet, with an increased range of up to 5,650 nm/10,500 km and an endurance of more than 12 flight hours, directly connecting city pairs like London and Los Angeles, Moscow and Jakarta, Tokyo and Dubai, and Beijing and Melbourne. Its cabin, with up to six living zones, is larger than the largest Gulfstream and Bombardier jets, but smaller than the Airbus A320-family-derived VIP aircraft.

Airbus is offering cabin designs for up to 18 passengers.

Comlux last month delivered its first completed ACJ320neo, the third neo to enter service worldwide. The company is the single largest customer for the Airbus ACJ320neo family of VVIP business jets, with an order for four. Its orderbook for Airbus corporate jets now totals 22 over the last decade. “We are the No. 1 client ever of Airbus in the VIP market,” Comlux’s Gaona says.

Comlux is unique in the industry in that it purchases aircraft on its own books, hoping to resell them to clients who will also select Comlux to outfit them and even operate them. Comlux has won completion contracts for all four of its A320neo family aircraft, making it the leading completions center for the type, Gaona says.

He acknowledges that Comlux’s strategy to buy aircraft before finding customers was very risky, “but it has paid off.” The company also purchased two Boeing 737 MAX 8s soon after they were introduced. The first arrived “green” at its Indianapolis center in February 2019, but completion has been delayed by the grounding of the aircraft type.

Airbus to start A350 deliveries from Tianjin - Chinadaily.com.cn - China Daily,"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaW5hZGFpbHkuY29tLmNuL2EvMjAyMDEwLzMwL1dTNWY5YjU0OTdhMzEwMjRhZDBiYTgyMDI0Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A350 passenger aircraft are seen at the Airbus factory in Blagnac near Toulouse in France, June 18, 2020. [Photo/Agencies]

European aircraft manufacturer Airbus said on Thursday that it is expected to deliver widebody A350 aircraft from its completion and delivery center in Tianjin from the first quarter of next year.

The Airbus Tianjin widebody completion and delivery center, the company's first widebody completion and delivery center outside Europe, is gradually shifting its work, including cabin installation and aircraft painting, to A350XWB.

""At the beginning, the delivery rate of A350 from Tianjin won't be too fast, and we plan to gradually increase the delivery rate to about one aircraft a month. China will become a very important strategic market for Airbus,"" said George Xu, CEO of Airbus China.

Meanwhile, Airbus delivered its 500th A320 family aircraft from its final assembly line in Tianjin to China Southern Airlines on Thursday. By the end of September, China Southern, the largest carrier in terms of fleet size in China, had an Airbus fleet of 368 aircraft, comprising A320,A330, A350 and A380.

""The delivery of the 500th A320 family aircraft, an A320neo, assembled in Tianjin, is an important achievement of Airbus in China. It is a testimony to the excellent industrial cooperation between the Chinese aviation industry and Airbus. We are ready to develop and grow our strategic partnership in China,"" Xu said.

The Tianjin facility, which has been in operation for 12 years, has helped Airbus increase its market share in the country and steal a march over its US rival Boeing Co. In addition, Airbus has A320 family production facilities globally in Toulouse of France, Hamburg of Germany, and Mobile, Alabama of the United States.

Since the COVID-19 outbreak, which had an unprecedented negative effect on the global aviation industry, China has been the first major market where Airbus has seen a recovery in demand, and the Tianjin center was one of the earliest facilities of Airbus that resumed regular production.

""Given the ongoing pandemic worldwide, China has been doing well in the prevention and control of the contagion and resuming business. Airbus has been actively localizing its business in China and integrating itself into the aviation industrial chain in the country. It's the right strategy and will be a multi-win decision for different participants,"" said Lin Zhijie, an aviation industry analyst and a columnist with Carnoc, a leading civil aviation website.

China's domestic air travel market is steadily picking up. Last month, the number of passengers who took flights reached 98 percent of the level recorded at the same time last year, and the number of available domestic flights surpassed that in the year-earlier period, according to the Civil Aviation Administration of China."
"Airbus sets quarterly cash goal, takes heavy restructuring charge - CNBC","Thu, 29 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjAvMTAvMjkvYWlyYnVzLXNldHMtcXVhcnRlcmx5LWNhc2gtZ29hbC10YWtlcy1oZWF2eS1yZXN0cnVjdHVyaW5nLWNoYXJnZS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Fuselage sections of Airbus A320-family aircrafts are seen at the Airbus facility in Montoir-de-Bretagne near Saint-Nazaire, France, July 1, 2020.

Analysts were expecting quarterly adjusted operating profit of 708 million euros on revenues of 11.439 billion, according to a company-compiled consensus.

Underlying or adjusted operating profit of 820 million euros marked a 49% drop from the same period last year, while revenues fell 27% to 11.2 billion euros.

The European planemaker, which is slashing jobs to cope with collapsing air travel demand, also took a 1.2-billion-euro ($1.42 billion) restructuring charge that drove it to a loss despite better-than-expected underlying operating profit.

Airbus said on Thursday it expected to reach cash breakeven in the fourth quarter, giving investors the first glimpse of future performance since the start of the coronavirus crisis after halting the bleeding of cash in the third quarter.

Airbus said it had contained cash outflows in the third quarter as it narrowed a gap between production and deliveries to airlines, which had slumped at the outset of the crisis.

However, the announcement came as France and Germany, where Airbus has its main factories, announced new restrictions to try to contain a resurgence of the COVID-19 epidemic.

Airbus has been saddled with a backlog of some 145 aircraft that airlines have postponed absorbing into their fleets as they struggle to survive the crisis. It said that this overhang of undelivered jets had shrunk to 135 planes by end-September.

The company has shored up deliveries partly by striking storage agreements with airlines unable to put jets directly into service. But some industry sources said a new lockdown in France raised new questions about its ability to deliver jets.

Airbus has said its planning reflects talks with customers. The company said its new restructuring charge may have to be reassessed depending on ongoing talks with unions over 15,000 job cuts, though it said these had ""advanced well"".

Chief Executive Guillaume Faury warned staff last month that cuts could include the first compulsory redundancies at Airbus as air travel failed to rebound as quickly as hoped.

Airbus also shed more light on a recent effort to smooth a long-running trade row with Boeing and the United States over aircraft subsidies by resetting the terms of French and Spanish government loans, saying it had cost 236 million euros.

The loans have been ruled illegal by the World Trade Organization, leading to U.S. tariffs on European goods. The European Union this week formally won the right to put its own tariffs on U.S. goods over aid for Boeing that the WTO found illegal. Both sides claim to have withdrawn illegal support."

Pros

Space and cost. A huge cabin with more than 90 styles and layout with an impressive range.

Cons

The ACJ TwoTwenty will fly up to 5,650nm (10,500km) the equivalent of over 12 flight hours. However that is about 1,500nm short of a Global 7500’s range. Although there are 90 styles and layouts you do not get the same customisation with other ACJs or Boeing Business Jets – but you cannot get a new one for anything like this price.

Summary

Airbus launched the ACJ TwoTwenty on October 6 2020 to create what it is calling the extra-large business jet category. Due to enter service in 2023. Twice as quiet and with up to 25% less fuel burn than other aircraft of its size (30m body length), the ACJ TwoTwenty also boasts triple the cabin space and, Airbus reports, is the most environmentally aircraft in its category.

ACJ has taken the A220 – originally launched by Bombardier as the C-Series – and turned it into a business jet. Comlux has an agreement to complete the first 15 allowing buyers to get a widecabin aircraft for the same prices as an ultra-long range jet. Which boasts a longer range than its airliner cousin, A220-100, thanks to added fuel capacity.

Flying

The ACJ TwoTwenty will fly more than 5,500nm which, although less than an ultra-long range jet, is still over 12 flight hours, and means the aircraft is able to directly connect city pairs like London and Los Angeles, Moscow and Jakarta, Tokyo and Dubai as well as Beijing and Melbourne. Flights longer than this are rare for most VVIP users. Airlines are already operating A220 aircraft, but the TwoTwenty has significant modifications – including five auxiliary fuel tanks.

With a top speed of Mach 0.82 or 629mph the TwoTwenty also boasts the ability to access virtually all significant business aviation airports globally thanks to its 5,249ft (1,600m) takeoff distance. In fact, its cousin the A220-100 is the largest aircraft able to operate within London City Airport, where space is at a premium. The ACJ TwoTwenty has a body 35m in length with a wingspan of 35.1m.

Travelling

This is where the jet comes into its own. It may not fly as far as an Ultra-Long range jet but it offers three times more cabin space.

With 73m² (785 ft²) of floor space distributed over six VIP areas, the ACJ TwoTwenty will cater to up to 18 passengers in a cabin 23.7m long and up to 3.28m wide. There will be a Wi-Fi system across the whole cabin and further innovations, such as electro-chromatic windows, LED lighting, large full-lie flat seats, a US-king size bed, a standing rain shower and a humidifying system onboard.

The A220 already has very large windows – so much so that airlines no longer need to light the cabin on day time flights.

ACJ’s designer Sylvain Mariner has proposed three styles for cabin interior so far – Avante Garde, Timeless and Clean Systems. These styles can then be rearranged into over 80 various cabin layouts.

In a first for Airbus, the OEM has partnered with Comlux, so the first 15 ACJ TwoTwenty aircraft will go to Comlux’s approved ACJ completion centre in Indianapolis. From there, Comlux is able to offer a customisable layout to meet the clients’ specifications. “We have worked jointly with ACJ and shared our long experience in operating and completing all types of aircraft, to allow the new bizjet to offer more comfort and the latest cabin innovations available in the industry,” said Richard Gaona, CEO, Comlux.

Owning

Potential buyers will be happy to hear ACJ, President, Benoit Defforge say the TwoTwenty possesses “unbeatable economics and reliability”.

Defforge told CJI the ACJ TwoTwenty had been created by combining the experience of Comlux and Airbus to create a unique aircraft. “Whether you are operating an ACJ 220 or a G500 life onboard is different. So, what you need to offer to the customers is different and the way you design the cabin is also different. So, we put all that together and created a unique product.”

The list price has not yet been fully disclosed.

Hard facts:

Maximum range: 5,650 nm/10,500 km

Maximum speed: Mach 0.82/629mph

Typical passengers:18

Typical crew: 3-4

Cabin space: 73m² ( 785 ft²)

List price for new aircraft (estimate): $70 – $81.5m.

news by Alasdair Whyte October 6, 2020 Print this page

Airbus Corporate Jets has announced the launch of the ACJTwoTwenty, a VIP version of its A220 jet.

Comlux has been appointed exclusive partner for the outfitting of the first 15 aircraft and has ordered two.

With a range of 5,650 nm (10,500 km), a 73m² (785 ft²) six-zone cabin – three times the size of ultra-long range jets – and an outfitted price of below $80m, Airbus believes it will create a new category: the extra-large business jet.

“It is a different proposal than compared to the ultra-long-range jets. Now you have the possibility this ACJ TwoTwenty to select a very decent range – transcontinental aircraft with a very large cabin,” Benoit Defforge, President ACJ told Corporate Jet Investor. “This new segment will price will be just below the price range of ultra-long business jets. We have the complete package, the product, the positioning and the price.”

Airbus has already sold six ACJ TwoTwenty aircraft. This comprises the two orders from Comlux and four from undisclosed customers. The first aircraft is expected to be delivered to customers in early 2023.

“From an operator point of view, this aircraft really is in a new segment,” said Richard Gaona, executive chairman & CEO Comlux, in an interview with Corporate Jet Investor. “Until now, you have had a long tube going far. And then you had a wider tube, with more comfort, giving you less range. The TwoTwenty is giving you, five thousand six hundred nautical miles and it’s huge.”

Fly more than 12 hours

The ACJ TwoTwenty can fly more than 12 flight hours, so is able to directly connect London and Los Angeles, Moscow and Jakarta, Tokyo and Dubai or Beijing and Melbourne.

Comlux will complete the aircraft at its Indianapolis facility. It is dedicating its largest, 130,000sq ft, hangar to Airbus completions.

Buyers will be able to choose from a range of options – but will not have the complete freedom that they get with an ACJ319.

“We are able to have a very competitive price by this approach. And, at the same time, it’s not a model or concept where you have three different options,” says Ganoa. “There are, 80 different options and the client can really define his or her own cabin with their own taste.”

ACJ TwoTwenty aircraft will have a six-zone cabin. This will include a business and guest lounge as well as a private entertainment space and a private suite – with a US- king-size bed, a standing rain-shower and private bathroom.

“Benoit instructed designer Sylvain Mariat [ACJ’s head of Creative Design] to design something new. To really apply the concept: ‘a place in the sky’. And then our engineers and the engineers of Airbus worked together,” said Gaona.

‘Reliability and low maintenance’

“And we put [together] all the experience of completions we did already – 13 completions from A319, A320, A321, A330. But we also used our experience as an operator and then we said, come on, this should be that way. Because you don’t define the cabin just from an interior design point of view. You have to design the cabin as well for reliability and low maintenance.”

Mariat has unveiled three concepts: Avante Garde, Timeless and Clean Systems.

The ACJ TwoTwenty aircraft will have Ku connectivity – twice as fast as most traditional business jets – a Wi-Fi system, electro-chromatic windows, LED lighting and a humidification system. All A220s have large windows.

Although the A220-100 airline version was designed for between 100 and 120 passengers, the ACJ TwoTwenty is designed for 18 passengers. Airbus will add five extra fuel tanks – carrying five more tonnes of fuel – to give it extra range. It will also be certified for 180 minute Extended-range Twin-engine Operational Performance Standards (ETOPs).

This is the first time that Airbus Corporate Jets has selected an exclusive partner for completions. “Comlux selected the ACJ TwoTwenty and we selectied Comlux as an exclusive supplier for the cabin. And we put together all our knowledge”, says Defforge. “It shows the trust between the two companies. It is not is not a one-day collaboration, it is a long-term partnership.”"

Helicopters are essential — performing crucial missions that impact our lives on a daily basis whether we realize it or not, such as maintaining critical infrastructure; carrying people, supplies, and maintenance workers to offshore wind farms and oil rigs; protecting our communities; and saving lives when every second counts. As the Covid-19 pandemic turned the world upside down, helicopters played a fundamental role in many countries by transporting patients from overrun hospitals to less impacted ones, and by bringing medical supplies and food to remote regions struggling under lockdown restrictions.

Airbus Helicopters was, more than ever, attentive to customer needs, taking immediate action to help crews access protective gear and equipment; rapidly putting in place new distance learning solutions; and leveraging the new AirbusWorld collaborative customer platform and customer support networks to ensure proximity, reactivity, and a streamlined and effective customer experience. In addition, the company has taken steps to improve parts availability worldwide, such as increasing stock coverage with 30,000 new part numbers, and implementing new transport solutions (e.g. drop shipments) for AOG situations.

New on the scene

The H135 and H145 are market leaders in the helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) segment, which will soon be able to take advantage of a newcomer on the scene. Deliveries of the five-bladed H145 have started following the type certification by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in June this year. The launch customer, the Norwegian Nolas Foundation, will use its helicopter for advanced HEMS research and development purposes. The new five-bladed H145 offers operators a useful load increase of 150 kilograms (330 pounds) and simplified maintenance operations, while also improving ride comfort for passengers and crew. Certification by the Federal Aviation Administration will follow before year-end.

The next-generation medium twin H160 was certified by EASA at the beginning of July — a truly multi-role helicopter designed to address every main mission segment from offshore transportation, HEMS, and public services, to private and business aviation. The French Gendarmerie Nationale, accelerated by the French government’s support plan, recently became the law enforcement launch customer with the intention to procure 10 of the model for counter-terrorism, law enforcement, and surveillance missions. The H160’s D level full flight simulator was recently qualified by EASA, coming just a couple of months after aircraft certification as the program readies for the helicopter’s entry into service at the end of the year.

Firefighting

2020 has been another year marked by forest fires around the globe — from Australia to Argentina to the western U.S. Firefighting is a mission in which helicopters play an increasing role thanks to their maneuverability and capacity to fly quickly to areas that are difficult to access otherwise. Equipped with water buckets, helicopters can help contain a fire and slow down its progress, but they also play an important role in carrying equipment and deploying firefighters in the field. In France, helicopters from the Super Puma family joined firefighting efforts this summer, with each aircraft dropping as much as 200,000 liters (52,830 US gallons) of water over a four-hour cycle. The H125 leads the aerial work market, being one of the most popular single-engines for firefighting missions. Following the announcement made at Heli-Expo in January, operators will soon be able to enjoy a performance increase with up to 190 kg (419 lb.) of additional payload in hot and high conditions.

Missions of the future

The pandemic has increased awareness of the need for sustainable aviation and Airbus is committed to leading that change. The H160 already takes a step in the right direction with its 15 percent reduction in fuel burn and sound levels divided by half. Meanwhile, the electrically powered, eight-rotor CityAirbus demonstrator is enabling development of key technological bricks for autonomy and electrification that will shape future helicopters as well as electric VTOL aircraft. Airbus Helicopters has been making progress on the flight testing of CityAirbus, which performed its first fully automatic flight in July and has since moved to the Manching test airfield for continued flight envelope expansion.

Performance and Luxury

Throughout the pandemic, the private and business aviation market served by Airbus Corporate Helicopters has remained active, buoyed in part by the certification of two new models and the introduction of the ACH130 Aston Martin Edition. Along with the other H160 variants, the ACH160 is now EASA-certified and indeed that approval was closely followed by a new sale to an experienced Italian operator. Similarly the new ACH145 is certified by EASA and first delivery of the model, to Advanced Flight of New Zealand, is due later this year. The ACH130 Aston Martin Edition has been well received since its launch at the start of the year and several customers are confirmed around the world. Private owners who enjoy the pleasure of driving high-performance cars are clearly attracted by the idea of flying a helicopter featuring internal and external design concepts drawn from Aston Martin’s renowned creative team."

France Urges Parts Review After Airbus A380 Engine Blowout Caused by Metal Fatigue - Insurance Journal,"Thu, 01 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc3VyYW5jZWpvdXJuYWwuY29tL25ld3MvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC8yMDIwLzEwLzAxLzU4NDc3OS5odG3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French investigators have called for a review of the design and maintenance of titanium alloy engine parts to ensure they guard against the risks of metal fatigue following an engine blowout on an Airbus A380 exactly three years ago.

France’s BEA agency made the recommendation in a final report into the accident in which an Air France jet carrying more than 500 passengers lost the front section of one of its four engines while flying over Greenland, before landing safely in Canada.

The move follows a perilous investigation involving a 21-month international aerial and ground search across the ice sheet to find a crucial titanium alloy fragment, buried 3 meters below the surface and just a meter away from a hidden crevasse.

The probe focused on the fan hub at the center of a 3-meter-wide fan at the front of the engine made by Engine Alliance, co-owned by General Electric and Pratt & Whitney.

The BEA said a recovered fragment had shown tiny fatigue cracks in a titanium alloy called Ti-6-4 and urged regulators – the Federal Aviation Administration and European Union Aviation Safety Agency – to carry out a review of design, manufacturing, maintenance and certification processes.

“Neither the manufacturer nor the certification authorities had anticipated this phenomenon in this alloy during the design of the engine,” the BEA said.

Such recommendations by leading investigators do not have to be followed automatically but typically carry some weight.

Engine Alliance said it had already taken steps to address the findings. Airbus said no flaws had been found during inspections of other engines from the same supplier, one of two A380 engine manufacturers alongside Rolls-Royce.

A spokeswoman for Rolls said it was confident the issues associated with the Engine Alliance part “cannot be attributed to any Rolls-Royce engine fan discs currently in service.”

Titanium alloy is used widely in aerospace, the metal’s biggest customer due to its strength compared to the weight of each part, and its ability to handle high temperatures.

The industry has faced concerns in the past about titanium alloy manufacturing processes following an engine failure.

In 1989, a severe engine blowout on a United Airlines DC-10 led to the death of 111 people during an attempted landing at Sioux City, Iowa.

That crash sped improvements in manufacturing methods for titanium alloy. But some engine experts have rejected any suggestion that there is an industry-wide manufacturing issue.

During the operation in Greenland to find the missing A380 engine fragment, French, Danish and U.S. specialists battled problems from faulty generators to storms, buried tents and concerns about polar bears, according to an expedition report.

At one point, the team resorted to low-tech methods including bamboo sticks and concentrated juice to mark the snow after their high-precision positioning system failed, but the investigation also spurred development of new sensor equipment.

No Air dominance without Space dominance - Airbus,"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIwLTEwLW5vLWFpci1kb21pbmFuY2Utd2l0aG91dC1zcGFjZS1kb21pbmFuY2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Future Combat Air System (FCAS) will create a network of manned and unmanned platforms in the sky from fighter to drones, up to satellites. Connected to ground and maritime forces, these air- and space-borne assets will bring the next level of Air Power to denied environments

How will Space make a difference to FCAS?

Connectivity is a key requirement for the Future Combat Air System. With increasing amounts of secured information shared between forces, data access and processing capabilities will be game-changers in improving situational awareness and ensuring mission success.

For FCAS to operate as a system-of-systems, space connectivity needs to be fast, secure and global. This means satellite constellations must deliver resilient, secure, high data rate communication services, support secure geo navigation, provide global, real-time, reconfigurable coverage, guarantee low probability of intercept and detection, and be capable of joint forces’ operations.

Space not only connects but also contributes directly to improving situational awareness:

Space based Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance (ISR) satellite constellations will allow rapid on demand collection and near real-time delivery of tactical ISR information. This will enable the resilient delivery of air, ground and sea situational awareness far beyond the line of site.

Space-based sensors using the above satellite constellations will be key to detecting hypersonic and/or stealth platforms in near real time.

Space-borne Aerial Situational Awareness and Navigation aids in hostile environments will also be provided from such Space-based platforms, bringing advanced capabilities and performance to FCAS.

FCAS will be an incremental journey with several target architectures planned along the way to achieve full collaborative combat by 2040. Space-based architectures will need to be fully operational at this time.

So, how do we get there? Technology demonstrators for such constellation satellite systems will be a first achievement. An initial generation of satellite processors and optical inter-satellite links will then enable testing of new air interfaces and network communication techniques prior to developing a multi-layer Non-Geostationary Satellite Orbit (NGSO) constellation after 2030.

Airbus’ proven and existing capabilities in the FCAS partner countries put these ambitious targets within reach. The pedigree of national security secure communication programmes such as SatCom-BW and groundbreaking laser data transfer of the SpaceDataHighway can now be combined to enhance future capability. The rapid and highly digitalised and automated experience of the OneWeb constellation and its derivative products serve as a basis for cutting-edge Earth observation programmes like CNES’ upcoming CO3D – while also providing lessons for the fully reconfigurable OneSat telecommunication satellites. Such highly agile and flexible satellites will form the cornerstone of the FCAS space capability. Know-how in navigation, proven through EGNOS and Galileo, as well as remote sensing, optical and radar observation, round out an unrivalled industrial skill set across France, Germany and Spain.

These, and many more mature technologies will allow the Space segment of FCAS to play a major part in allowing European Air Forces to achieve Future Air Power in denied environments.
