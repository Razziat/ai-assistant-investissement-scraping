The contract includes a six-month base and 4.5 option years, with a potential total value of more than $1.5 Billion. Airbus will provide support across 67 Lakota sites in the U.S. and overseas. This includes National Guard bases in 43 states, and Fort Rucker in Alabama, where the UH-72A performs the Army’s Initial Entry Rotary Wing mission (IERW).

The CLS contract with the U.S. Army is the largest helicopter performance-based support contract managed by Airbus worldwide.

“Airbus has provided exceptional product and support services in the UH-72A for nearly two decades,” said COL Calvin Lane, U.S. Army Utility Project Manager. “This contract underscores the Army’s trust in the aircraft’s capabilities, and we look forward to the continued support this contract provides to the UH-72 fleet.”

“We are honored to be extending our relationship with the U.S. Army for another 5 years. Airbus continues to prove its commitment to providing high-quality platforms and outstanding support to the men and women who fly these exceptional aircraft,” said Scott Tumpak, Vice President of Military Helicopters division at Airbus in the U.S. “We are proud of our more than 15-year record of providing excellent service and hope to continue this partnership for many years to come,” he added.

The UH-72B is produced at Airbus’ facility in Columbus, Mississippi while logistics are managed from the facility in Dallas, Texas. The workforce supporting these platforms is approximately 40% U.S. military veterans.

The U.S. Army utilizes the UH-72A and UH-72B models to perform a variety of missions including the counter drug and southwest border missions for the Army’s National Guard.

Last year, the UH-72 Lakota fleet exceeded the 1 million flight-hour mark, some 15 years after the first Lakota UH-72A entered service with the U.S. Army. The Lakota platform is a highly capable, twin-engine aircraft with modern glass-cockpit, flight control, and navigation systems. The Lakota remains the Army’s lowest cost twin-engine helicopter to buy, own and operate."

“Airbus has been an extraordinary partner as we work together daily to help change people’s lives.”

Last week, Airbus announced plans to ramp up global production of A320 Family jets, including the addition of the new 350,000 square-foot FAL in Mobile. Details about the new jobs at the Alabama facility were not released at that time.

“The fact that Mobile will lead our unprecedented global production rate increase in coming years is a tribute to the world-class labor force in Alabama,” said C. Jeffrey Knittel, Chairman and CEO of Airbus Americas.

“I’m so proud of our Mobile employees for proving through years of hard work what Alabama is capable of, and I’m also immensely grateful to state leadership for making Alabama such a great place to invest and do business.”

WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT

To facilitate Airbus’ hiring plans, Alabama workforce development and education organizations are collaborating on new recruitment and training initiatives to build out the jobs pipeline, said Ed Castile, director of AIDT and Deputy Secretary of the Alabama Department of Commerce.

“Airbus has been an extraordinary partner as we work together daily to help change people’s lives,” Castile said.

“Airbus provides incredible career opportunities, and we have the awesome opportunity to help them find their team and assist with training.”

Castile said AIDT plans to expand its Aviation Training Center at the Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley, a 36,500-square-foot facility that opened in 2014 specifically to help Airbus get production up and running.

AIDT is also expanding apprenticeship programs and supporting Airbus training initiatives at Flight Works Alabama, including FlightPath9, We Build It Better and aviation dual enrollment at area schools, he added.

Flight Works Alabama is an aerospace education center located near the Airbus facility that aims to inspire future aviation workers across the Mobile region. The 15,000-square-foot facility, which features more than 40 high-tech exhibits, opened in August 2020.

Flight Works also directs the FlightPath9 program that targets high school seniors in the Mobile community with a desire to work in aerospace. We Build It Better is an innovative learning program that provides classroom kits and interactive techniques designed to help instructors expand students’ creative capacity and encourage discoveries.

“We see Airbus as the ‘tip of the spear’ with its Alabama location and its continued growth as a powerful catalyst for an expansion of the aerospace industry in our state,” Castile said.

“This Airbus expansion simply highlights that Alabama is open for business and a great place to work and raise a family.”

GROWTH PLANS

Airbus produced the first Alabama-built A320 aircraft in 2015, and it launched production of the A220 single-aisle passenger jet in Mobile during 2019, with a new assembly line specifically for the A220 opening the next year. Read about the A220 production line.

Airbus has invested over $1 billion its Alabama manufacturing facility.

Greg Canfield, Secretary of the Alabama Department of Commerce, said the state’s aerospace/aviation industry is primed for growth. During 2021, companies within the sector announced new investments totaling $220 million in projects expected to create 667 jobs, Commerce data indicate.

“Aerospace industry growth continues to be a high-value opportunity for Alabama, not only in terms of capital investment but also in job creation,” Secretary Canfield said.

“There are a lot of exciting things going in aerospace and aviation in the state, and we’re seeing that today with the expansion at Airbus.”

Mobile officials praised Airbus for its commitment to growth at the Brookley manufacturing site.

“Mobile is quickly becoming a global epicenter for the aerospace industry, and the addition of a third final assembly line in Mobile is a testament to our area’s workforce,” said David Rodgers, vice president of economic development at the Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce."
Thales selected by Airbus for its new flight management system - Thales,"Fri, 06 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvYWVyb3NwYWNlL3ByZXNzX3JlbGVhc2UvdGhhbGVzLXNlbGVjdGVkLWFpcmJ1cy1pdHMtbmV3LWZsaWdodC1tYW5hZ2VtZW50LXN5c3RlbdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales selected by Airbus for its new flight management system United States Share this article

Thales has been selected by Airbus to equip its commercial airliners with the most powerful and innovative flight management system on the market.

This new fully connected flight management system from Thales provides secure access to open-world data and offers airlines an array of new possibilities.

The new flight management system, which is based on the PureFlyt product and has been adapted to meet the specific requirements of Airbus, will process and share vast amounts of data to optimise flight operations, enhance interoperability and reduce environmental impact.

The new flight management system (FMS), which is based on the PureFlyt product and has been adapted to meet the specific needs of Airbus, will be developed by Thales to equip Airbus commercial airliners, and in particular the A320, A330 and A350, with service entry planned for the end of 2026. The new system will improve interoperability for airlines and pilots and optimise flight paths to help reduce the carbon footprint of airline operations.

With its expertise in avionics, connectivity and cybersecurity and air traffic management, Thales is the only European company to offer end-to-end onboard and ground-based solutions that help to meet the ambitious objectives of optimising flight operations in terms of the air transport sector's carbon footprint.

The FMS is the “brain” of the aircraft. It is used to prepare flights, calculate and provide the crew with the information they need, set flight parameters and ensure aircraft guidance throughout the flight and during approach and landing procedures, based on fuel efficiency factors and instructions from air traffic control. Designed from the outset to be connected and cybersecure, the system maximises the benefits of access to open-world data including real-time weather information. By linking the new FMS with non-avionics systems — such as the pilot’s Electronic Flight Bag and airline operational control centres — the solution makes it quicker and easier to analyse flight plan revisions, providing the pilot with the best route and simplifying interaction with air traffic control. It will help to ease airport congestion, cut fuel consumption, decrease noise pollution and reduce pilot workload.

PureFlyt draws on 40 years of experience in flight management systems and over 100 million flight hours with Thales’s current generation of FMS systems, enabling airlines to benefit from an optimal combination of flight safety, operational efficiency and fuel savings. This comprehensive solution includes navigation and performance databases for precise calculation of optimal flight paths and flight times. Airbus’s choice of a system that is compatible with all its aircraft will enhance fleet interoperability for airlines and make it easier for pilots to make the transition from one Airbus aircraft type to another. The new system, which is based on the PureFlyt product and has been adapted to meet the specific needs of Airbus, will also be available as a retrofit option for aircraft currently in service.

“As the only player in flight management technologies in Europe, Thales is proud to contribute to the digital transformation of the airways with our flight management system, and delighted to have this opportunity to continue to support our partner Airbus. Our connected and cybersecure solution will improve interoperability for airlines and pilots and optimise flight paths to help reduce the carbon footprint of airline operations.” Yannick Assouad, Executive Vice President, Avionics, Thales."
Pontifications: Airbus delays for A220 tied to supply chain issues - Leeham News and Analysis,"Mon, 23 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wNS8yMy9wb250aWZpY2F0aW9ucy1haXJidXMtZGVsYXlzLWZvci1hMjIwLXRpZWQtdG8tc3VwcGx5LWNoYWluLWlzc3Vlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"May 23, 2022, © Leeham News: The delivery delays for the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX get all the headlines. But Airbus also has delivery delays for the Airbus Canada A220.

There are at least three A220s missing cockpit installations on the ramp at the Mirabel Airport final assembly line with more coming off the FAL, LNA is told. The number of A220s with this traveled work at the Mobile (AL) FAL is not known. Some quality control issues at the Mobile plant, which is still in its learning curve phase, have been reported.

Supply chain issues

Airbus Canada ducked directly answering questions about the traveled work and delays. A spokesperson said in a written statement that “We are constantly working closely with all major A220 suppliers and partners in order to provide assistance and support to ensure on-time and on quality delivery of A220 parts to protect our pre-FAL/FAL operations.

“As a reminder, we delivered 50 A220 aircraft in 2021 – the highest number ever for A220s and continue to ramp up our A220 production, with the addition of the pre-FAL in Mirabel supporting our pre-assembly work since January. We are still early in the 2022 year and are collaborating closely with our suppliers and partners to protect our delivery targets.”

Further comment was declined. It’s known that Airbus, like Boeing, is going through supply chain issues still related to COVID and now the war in Ukraine that interrupted some suppliers. Airbus adjusts the build sequence to protect its FAL operations.

Ramping up production

Airbus Canada currently produces the A220 at a rate of four or five a month at Montreal Mirabel Airport and one a month at the Mobile FAL. Montreal has a capacity of 10/mo and Mobile’s capacity is 4/mo. The Mobile plant is new, opened a year ago last Thursday. Assembly of the A220 in Mobile began in 2019 in the A320 FAL facility. Workers are still on the learning curve process. At least one customer taking delivery of the A220 from Mobile complains about quality control, but details weren’t forthcoming.

Airbus wants to ramp up production to the full capacity of 14/mo between the two plants by 2025. Costs remain too high, and Airbus is pressing suppliers to lower costs. But ramping up to a rate of 14/mo is also critical to turning the A220 from a loss to a profit.

The current backlog doesn’t support production rates this high. But the A320neo line is sold out to 2027; Airbus has a goal to increase production to 75/mo by 2025, which brings its own supply chain issues. Selling A220s may relieve some of the lower-end demand for 150-seat airplanes. Bombardier, the forerunner of Airbus Canada, designed what was then called the CS500 (now conceptually the A220-500), a plane directly competitive with the A320neo and the Boeing 737-8 MAX. The A220-500 would seat about 175 passengers in two-class configuration.

Airbus officials say an A220-500 will happen. But they want to program to turn profitable before launching the -500—or at least be in sight of profitability. Getting to rate 14/mo is one of the key metrics.

There have been 740 orders placed for the A220 (104 A220-100s, 638 A220-300s). Two hundred eight have been delivered (55 and 153, respectively).

Airbus lays the foundations for future urban air mobility in Germany with the Air Mobility Initiative - Airbus,"Wed, 04 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wNS1haXJidXMtbGF5cy10aGUtZm91bmRhdGlvbnMtZm9yLWZ1dHVyZS11cmJhbi1haXItbW9iaWxpdHktaW7SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Munich, To contribute to the development of advanced air mobility, leading companies, universities, and research institutions as well as municipalities are joining forces under the leadership of Airbus to form the Air Mobility Initiative (AMI). The members of the Air Mobility Initiative include Airbus, City of Ingolstadt, Deutsche Bahn, Deutsche Flugsicherung, Diehl Aerospace, Droniq, Munich Airport, Red Cross, and Telekom.



This initiative, which is supported by the Free State of Bavaria and the Federal Republic of Germany, will set up a series of research projects aimed at making urban air mobility within and between cities a reality. The joint projects are centered around three main areas: electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, unmanned traffic management (UTM) services, airport & city integration including vertiports.



""In many parts of the world, eVTOLs will offer a whole new mobility service in the near future,"" said Markus May, Head of Operations for urban air mobility at Airbus. ""Airbus and the AMI partners are aware that the introduction of such a system requires the cooperation of many players with different competences. Our goal is to build a transport service that benefits society and this is what we are setting up here in Bavaria.”



In a first step, the AMI partners will address the technological, infrastructural, legal, and social prerequisites for the future implementation of advanced air transport. Subsequently, the knowledge gained will be carried through a demonstration project under real conditions with eVTOLs.



Airbus is leading the vehicle stream together with Diehl Aerospace, University of Stuttgart and other partners. The UTM activities will deal with the safe and efficient flight of vehicles on their routes in and outside cities. This area is being advanced together with Droniq, Airbus, f.u.n.k.e. Avionics, SkyFive, BrigkAir, DFS, Telekom, Universities from Munich and Hamburg and other partners. Through the vertiport activities, AMI will work on take-off and landing sites for the aircraft as well as their integration into airports and cities. Munich Airport, Deutsche Bahn, Bauhaus Luftfahrt, Airport Nürnberg, Universities of Ingolstadt and Munich are responsible for this topic.



Work on the individual AMI projects began in January 2022. The test flights of the demonstration project will be carried out in the region around Ingolstadt. The initiative is funded with a total of €17 million from the Free State of Bavaria and €24 million from the Federal Government. Together with the industry's own funds, this results in a total activity of € 86 million over a period of three years.

A factory that’s out of this world

The upcoming opening of Airbus’ next production site is not going to be in Europe or the United States ... It’s going to be truly out of this world - up in space!

Up to now, this was pure science fiction. But as early as next year, it will become reality - to some extent, at least. And Airbus is making it happen. Because that's when the astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS) will take their own practical companion on board: Metal3D, the first metal 3D printer in space.

Brick #1: micro-gravity metallurgy

Metal3D, developed by Airbus for the European Space Agency (ESA), is a real game changer. It uses metal as source material and prints it at 1,200 degrees Celsius to produce new parts such as radiation shields, tooling or equipment directly in orbit. Future versions of the 3D printer could also use materials such as regolith (moondust), or recycled parts from decommissioned satellites. As early as the end of this decade, 3D printers could also be used on the Moon, enabling a sustainable human presence there by printing structures for lunar rovers or habitats.

3D printing in space or on the Moon is only the beginning. Airbus wouldn't be Airbus if it didn't take in-space manufacturing to the next level. As soon as in the next three to four years, it will be producing and assembling entire satellites in space. So its next satellite factory will not be in Europe or the United States, but in space, hundreds of kilometers above us!

Remote video URL

All this is clearly ambitious, but drawing on its true pioneering spirit, it will make that fly too. In its labs across Europe, and building on what it learnt from rethinking satellite design for the OneWeb constellation satellites,its teams are working hard to make the Space Assembly Line a reality. They have already developed a robotic manipulator that can perform accurate and complex operations for assembling and manufacturing satellites. It can even be used to refill and repair spacecraft. Additionally, its experts have created algorithms so that the robotic arms can work together - and even build each other.

Brick # 2: autonomous robotics for space assembly_interaction tests

Since there is enough space in space, it will be possible to build bigger structures such as huge reflectors, allowing telecom satellites to cover the entire planet. Airbus’ solution is to launch kit parts that will be assembled in space by the robotic arms from our space factory.

Brick# 3: kit assembly for huge reflectors

Producing satellites and larger structures directly in orbit will revolutionise traditional space system manufacturing: not only will production on Earth no longer be necessary; weight and size constraints associated with getting satellites to their orbit will be a thing of the past.

Remote video URL

Not to mention that production in space is sustainable: fewer rocket launches are needed, and the material for production can be sourced from the space debris floating around. So with the space factory, Airbus is also helping to clean up space and ensure a sustainable future for the industry.

This is not science fiction, the space factory will soon be science fact. At Airbus, we’re making it happen. #NextSpace"
Virtual flight-test campaign and lab test paving way for A321XLR's first flight - Airbus,"Tue, 31 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTA1LXZpcnR1YWwtZmxpZ2h0LXRlc3QtY2FtcGFpZ24tYW5kLWxhYi10ZXN0LXBhdmluZy13YXktZm9yLWEzMjF4bHJzLWZpcnN00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The construction and equipment installation phases for the three A321XLR flight-test aircraft are rapidly nearing completion in the FAL in Hamburg before the first of these – MSN11000 – will be handed over to the flight-test team in the very near future. In parallel, ground based testing campaigns are in full swing at various Airbus sites to prepare for the start of the flight-test and certification programmes.

One of these is the “virtual first flight” (VFF) campaign – whose overall purpose is to clear the aircraft’s new systems, flight control laws and the flight crew for commencing flight tests. This part of the A321XLR’s development focuses around a dedicated development simulator and a co-located avionics testing laboratory in Toulouse

Virtual flight-test campaign

In contrast to a full-flight simulator which moves on hydraulic jacks, the development simulator is fixed to the floor. As well as featuring real pilot controls and displays, there are also dedicated workstations behind it which feature the same displays and user interfaces as the flight test engineers (FTEs) will use to monitor the flight and adjust testing parameters in the real aircraft.

Adjacent to the development simulator’s entrance is a large virtual flight testing laboratory room filled with numerous racks containing real avionics modules – which are identical to those now being installed in the avionics bays of the three A321XLR flight-test aircraft. Moreover, these modules can be connected directly to the simulator and be virtually flown and evaluated by the Airbus test pilots while being monitored by their FTE colleagues.

Linking the avionics in the lab directly to the simulator enables the engineering test pilots to validate the A321XLR’s modified flight control system laws, in specific conditions – such as during flare or during high-speed flight. They are also able to evaluate and fine tune how the aircraft would deal with external disturbances typically encountered during normal flight.

Vincent Claudel, Integrated Product Team Leader Lab & Flight Tests, comments: “The virtual flight test campaign which started in March will culminate with a Virtual First Flight (VFF) ‘rehearsal’ or dry-run. For this exercise, all the flight crew, comprising the test pilots, the test-flight engineer and the flight-test engineers, who are already assigned for the first flight will be seated in the simulator where they will run through all the phases which they will subsequently perform in the real aircraft.

Vincent adds: “The phases which they will rehearse during the VFF dry-run include, for example, the electrical and engine power-on, taxiing out, take-off, climb, the flight domain opening, all the way to landing, taxiing back, and powering down again. In fact, they will do everything they will do in the real flight, and in exactly the same order.”

Flight control system functional integration testing



In order to validate the flight control computers so they may be subsequently integrated with the main simulator, the avionics modules are first tested and fine-tuned by engineering specialists in a nearby laboratory using ‘Controller and Guidance Integration Benches’ (CGIBs).

There are several ‘Controller and Guidance Integration Benches’ (CGIBs) in Toulouse where avionics experts can test and fine-tune the A321XLR’s flight control computers.

“Before the avionics modules can be connected to the simulator, they undergo integration operational testing to validate them at system level to ensure the good behaviour of the aircraft’s flight control laws which they govern,” notes Vincent.



Partial ‘iron-bird’ ground test rig for the VTP’s new eRudder



The simulator can also be directly connected to and control physical aircraft hardware such as hydraulically-actuated control surfaces on a test-rig. On a totally new programme, such as the A350, this test rig was called an “iron bird”. However, since the A321XLR is a development of the A321neo, it was sufficient to simply provide a physical test rig representing just the tail section - specifically the vertical tail-plane (VTP). This is to facilitate testing on the ground of a new “eRudder” architecture which is being introduced across all A320 Family members.

Ground-based systems integration and testing



“The majority of the tests – such as for the flight control laws and autopilot – to prepare the -XLR for its first flight are being performed by the engineers and flight test crews in Toulouse, using the simulator plus the avionics benches. However, other test campaigns have been underway for more than a year already at the various Airbus sites to clear additional systems which are related to specific ATA Chapters,” notes Vincent.

To this end, the transnational development teams in Toulouse in France, Hamburg and Bremen in Germany and in Filton in the UK, have collaborated in the -XLR’s test-means campaign and systems integration activities.

“In Filton, UK, we have two big benches for what we call ‘Landing Gear Zero’ for validating the -XLR’s new uprated landing gear, wheels and brakes (ATA Chapter 32). Also in Filton is a ‘fuel integration bench’ to test the new fuel and inerting system (ATA Chapter 28) for the -XLR, and in particular to validate new modifications for the aircraft’s new Rear-Centre-Tank (RCT).”

“Meanwhile in Bremen, Germany, we have the high-lift system bench to validate the new inboard single-slotted flap configuration which is specific to -XLR. Then in Hamburg, we have air conditioning benches (ATA Chapter 21), as well as a ‘water & waste’ bench (ATA Chapter 38). Also in Hamburg we have a multi-climatic chamber to optimise the comfort in the cabin and cockpit during the long flights at high cruise altitudes.”

Airbus to further develop LISA gravitational wave observatory mission - Airbus,"Thu, 19 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wNS1haXJidXMtdG8tZnVydGhlci1kZXZlbG9wLWxpc2EtZ3Jhdml0YXRpb25hbC13YXZlLW9ic2VydmF0b3J50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Friedrichshafen, 19 May 2022 - Airbus has been awarded a contract from the European Space Agency (ESA) to further develop the implementation of LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), one of the most ambitious science missions ESA has planned to date. With Phase B1 now underway, the detailed mission design and final technology development activities for the gravitational wave observatory are due to be completed by 2024, with launch planned for the late 2030s.

Gravitational waves were first postulated by Albert Einstein. They are distortions in space-time, created when for example supermassive black holes - billions of times heavier than our sun - merge. These events are so powerful that the resulting gravitational waves can be measured by sensitive instruments from billions of light years away.

To measure these waves, LISA consists of three spacecraft that form an equilateral triangle deep in space, 2.5 million kilometres apart from each other. Gravitational waves stretch and compress space-time, causing the tiniest changes in distance between the LISA probes (less than the diameter of an atom). Any movements of test masses that free-fall inside the three spacecraft when a gravitational wave passes can be detected by the spacecrafts’ sensitive instruments. LISA will do this by using lasers that continuously transmit back and forth between the satellites using interferometry, measuring the distance between each of the test masses.

Some of the key technologies required for LISA were successfully tested in space with the LISA Pathfinder (LPF) mission developed and built by Airbus as prime. The mission results showed that LPF operated even more precisely than required for LISA. LPF was launched on 3rd December 2015 and ended in July 2017.

Gravitational waves are a new research method that uses gravity instead of light to measure dynamic processes in the universe. The study of gravitational waves offers enormous potential for discovering parts of the universe that are invisible in other ways. LISA will significantly expand our knowledge of the beginning, evolution, and structure of our universe. Gravitational waves have been detected by ground-based observatories in recent years – by experiments such as LIGO and the European Virgo observatory – but these facilities are limited in size and sensitivity, meaning that they are only able to detect high-frequency gravitational waves from particular sources (such as merging stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars).

142(1) commercial aircraft delivered in Q1 2022

A320 Family: Monthly production rates to increase to 75 in 2025 to meet customer demand

Revenues € 12.0 billion; EBIT Adjusted € 1.3 billion

EBIT (reported) € 1.4 billion; EPS (reported) € 1.55

Free cash flow before M&A and customer financing € 0.2 billion

Guidance unchanged; more challenging risk profile for the remainder of 2022

Amsterdam, 04 May 2022 – Airbus SE (stock exchange symbol: AIR) reported consolidated financial results for its First Quarter (Q1) ended 31 March 2022.

“These Q1 results reflect a solid performance across our commercial aircraft, helicopter and defence businesses. Our 2022 guidance is unchanged, even though the risk profile for the rest of the year has become more challenging due to the complex geopolitical and economic environment,” said Guillaume Faury, Airbus Chief Executive Officer. “Looking beyond 2022, we see continuing strong growth in commercial aircraft demand driven by the A320 Family. As a result we are now working with our industry partners to increase A320 Family production rates further to 75 aircraft a month in 2025. This ramp-up will benefit the aerospace industry’s global value chain.”

Gross commercial aircraft orders increased to 253 (Q1 2021: 39 aircraft) with net orders of 83 aircraft after cancellations (Q1 2021: -61 aircraft). The order backlog amounted to 7,023 commercial aircraft on 31 March 2022. Airbus Helicopters booked 56 net orders (Q1 2021: 40 units) and was awarded a contract for the Tiger MkIII attack helicopter upgrade programme. Airbus Defence and Space’s order intake by value increased to € 3.2 billion (Q1 2021: € 2.0 billion), corresponding to a book-to-bill ratio of around 1.3. Included is the Eurodrone global contract signed in February 2022, covering the development and manufacturing of 20 systems and 5 years of initial in-service support for Germany, France, Italy and Spain.

Consolidated revenues increased 15 percent to€ 12.0 billion (Q1 2021: € 10.5 billion), mainly reflecting the higher number of commercial aircraft deliveries and a favourable mix. A total of 142(1) commercial aircraft were delivered (Q1 2021: 125 aircraft), comprising 11 A220s, 109 A320 Family, 6 A330sand 16 A350s. The financial results reflect 140 commercial aircraft deliveries after the reduction of two aircraft previously recorded as sold in December 2021 for which a transfer was not possible due to international sanctions in place. Revenues generated by Airbus’ commercial aircraft activities increased 17 percent, mainly reflecting the higher deliveries and favourable mix. Airbus Helicopters delivered 39 units (Q1 2021: 39 units), with revenues rising 7 percent mainly reflecting growth in services and a favourable mix in programmes. Revenues at Airbus Defence and Space increased 16 percent, mainly driven by the Military Aircraft business and following the Eurodrone contract signature. One A400M transport aircraft was delivered in Q1 2022.

Consolidated EBIT Adjusted – an alternativeperformance measure and key indicator capturing the underlying business margin by excluding material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses – increased to € 1,263 million (Q1 2021: € 694 million). It includes a non-recurring positive element of € 0.4 billion related to the remeasurement of past service cost in the retirement obligations and also reflects efforts on competitiveness and the impact from cost containment. An amount of € -0.2 billion was recorded in Q1 2022 resulting from the impact of international sanctions against Russia.

EBIT Adjusted related to Airbus’ commercial aircraft activities increased to € 1,065 million (Q1 2021: € 533 million), mainly reflecting higher deliveries as well as the efforts on competitiveness and the effect from cost containment. It also includes the non-recurring impact from retirement obligations, partly offset by the impact of international sanctions against Russia.

Commercial aircraft production for the A320 Family is progressing towards a monthly rate of 65 aircraft by summer 2023, in a complex environment. Following an analysis of global customer demand as well as an assessment of the industrial ecosystem’s readiness, the Company is now working with its suppliers and partners to enable monthly production rates of 75 in 2025. This production increase will benefit the entire global industrial value chain. Airbus will meet the higher production rates by increasing capacity at its existing industrial sites and growing the industrial footprint in Mobile, US, while investing to ensure that all commercial aircraft assembly sites are A321-capable.

On the A321XLR, the Company continues to work towards a first flight by the end of Q2 2022. Initially planned for the end of 2023, the entry-into-service is now expected to take place in early 2024 in order to meet certification requirements.

Airbus Helicopters’ EBIT Adjusted increased to € 90 million (Q1 2021: € 62 million), partly driven by growth in services and favourable mix in programmes. It also reflects non-recurring elements, including the impact from retirement obligations.

EBIT Adjusted at Airbus Defence and Space was € 106 million (Q1 2021: € 59 million), mainly driven by Military Aircraft and following the Eurodrone contract signature. It also reflects the non-recurring impact from retirement obligations, partly offset by the consequences for the space business from the international sanctions against Russia.

On the A400M programme, development activities continue toward achieving the revised capability roadmap. Retrofit activities are progressing in close alignment with the customer. Risks remain on the qualification of technical capabilities and associated costs, on aircraft operational reliability in particular with regard to powerplant, on cost reductions and on securing export orders in time as per the revised baseline.

Consolidated self-financed R&Dexpenses totalled € 586 million (Q1 2021: € 620 million).

Consolidated EBIT(reported) amounted to € 1,429 million (Q1 2021: € 462 million), including net Adjustments of € +166 million.

These Adjustments comprised:

€ +190 million related to the dollar pre-delivery payment mismatch and balance sheet revaluation;

€ -11 million related to the A380 programme;

€ -13 million of other costs including compliance.

The financial result was € 166 million (Q1 2021: € 59 million). It mainly reflects the positive net impact from the revaluation of certain equity investments, partially offset by the revaluation of financial instruments as well as the net interest result of € -76 million. Consolidated net income(2) was € 1,219 million (Q1 2021: € 362 million) with consolidated reported earnings per share of € 1.55 (Q1 2021: € 0.46).

Consolidated free cash flowbefore M&A and customer financing was€ 213 million (Q1 2021: € 1,202 million), reflecting the level of deliveries, competitiveness and the impact of cost containment, partly offset by an increase in working capital mainly driven by inventory. Consolidated free cash flow was € 161 million (Q1 2021: € 1,164 million).

On 31 March 2022, the gross cash position stood at € 22.8 billion (year-end 2021: € 22.7 billion) with a consolidated net cash position(3) of € 7.7 billion (year-end 2021: € 7.7 billion). The Company’s liquidity position remains strong, standing at € 28.8 billion at the end of March 2022.

Outlook

The guidance issued in February 2022 remains unchanged.

As the basis for its 2022 guidance, the Company assumes no further disruptions to the world economy, air traffic, the Company’s internal operations, and its ability to deliver products and services.

The Company’s 2022 guidance is before M&A.

On that basis, the Company targets to achieve in 2022 around:

720 commercial aircraft deliveries;

EBIT Adjusted of € 5.5 billion;

Free Cash Flow before M&A and Customer Financing of € 3.5 billion.

The US Department of State has granted Airbus a nine-month extension of the duration of the Consent Agreement settling civil violations of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). Airbus initiated this request for an extension from the US Department of State because it had to redirect internal Export Control resources to the tracking and implementation of recent export control restrictions and international sanctions against Russia and Belarus. The Company does not expect the Consent Agreement extension to have an impact on the other agreements approved on 31 January 2020 with the UK, French and US authorities.

Glossary

KPI DEFINITION EBIT The Company continues to use the term EBIT (Earnings before interest and taxes). It is identical to Profit before finance result and income taxes as defined by IFRS Rules. Adjustment Adjustment, an alternative performance measure, is a term used by the Company which includes material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses. EBIT Adjusted The Company uses an alternative performance measure, EBIT Adjusted, as a key indicator capturing the underlying business margin by excluding material charges or profits caused by movements in provisions related to programmes, restructuring or foreign exchange impacts as well as capital gains/losses from the disposal and acquisition of businesses. EPS Adjusted EPS Adjusted is an alternative performance measure of basic earnings per share as reported whereby the net income as the numerator does include Adjustments. For reconciliation, see the Analyst presentation. Gross cash position The Company defines its consolidated gross cash position as the sum of (i) cash and cash equivalents and (ii) securities (all as recorded in the consolidated statement of financial position). Net cash position The Company defines its consolidated net cash position as the sum of (i) cash and cash equivalents and (ii) securities, minus (iii) financing liabilities, plus or minus (iiii) interest rate contracts related to fair value hedges (all as recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position). FCF For the definition of the alternative performance measure free cash flow, see the Universal Registration Document, MD&A section 2.1.6.1. It is a key indicator which allows the Company to measure the amount of cash flow generated from operations after cash used in investing activities. FCF before M&A Free cash flow before mergers and acquisitions refers to free cash flow as defined in the Universal Registration Document, MD&A section 2.1.6.1 adjusted for net proceeds from disposals and acquisitions. It is an alternative performance measure and key indicator that reflects free cash flow excluding those cash flows resulting from acquisitions and disposals of businesses. FCF before M&A and customer financing Free cash flow before M&A and customer financing refers to free cash flow before mergers and acquisitions adjusted for cash flow related to aircraft financing activities. It is an alternative performance measure and indicator that may be used occasionally by the Company in its financial guidance, especially when there is higher uncertainty around customer financing activities.

Footnotes:

Before a reduction of two aircraft previously recorded as sold in December 2021 for which a transfer was not possible due to international sanctions against Russia. Airbus SE continues to use the term Net Income/Loss. It is identical to Profit/Loss for the period attributable to equity owners of the parent as defined by IFRS Rules. The Company has decided to refine the net cash definition to include interest rate contracts related to fair value hedges, which is also reflected in the Q1 2022 balance.

Qantas confirms future Airbus fleet - Airbus,"Mon, 02 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wNS1xYW50YXMtY29uZmlybXMtZnV0dXJlLWFpcmJ1cy1mbGVldNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A350-1000 to fly the world’s longest routes

A220, A321XLR to renew the carrier’s domestic fleet

New levels of efficiency, comfort and sustainability

#A350 #LongRangeLeader #A220 #A321XLR #Sunrise #Winton

Toulouse, 2 May 2022 - Australia’s Qantas Group has confirmed that it will order 12 A350-1000s, 20 A220s and 20 A321XLRs. The news was announced at a ceremony in Sydney attended by Qantas Group CEO Alan Joyce and Airbus Chief Commercial Officer and Head of Airbus International, Christian Scherer.

The A350-1000 was selected by Qantas following an evaluation known as Project Sunrise and will enable the carrier to operate the world's longest commercial flights. These will include linking Sydney and Melbourne with destinations such as London and New York non-stop for the first time ever. Featuring a premium layout, the A350 fleet will also be used by Qantas on other international services. The A350-1000 is powered by the latest generation Trent XWB engines from Rolls-Royce.

In the single aisle category the A220 and A321XLR were chosen under an evaluation called Project Winton. The aircraft will be used by the Qantas Group on domestic services across the country, which can extend to over five hours. In addition, the A321XLR offers the range capability for flights from Australia to South East Asia, enabling the Qantas Group to open up new direct routes. The A220 and A321XLR fleets will both be powered by Pratt & Whitney GTF engines.

This agreement is in addition to the existing order for 109 A320neo Family aircraft, which includes the A321XLR for the Qantas Group low cost subsidiary Jetstar.

Qantas Group CEO Alan Joyce said: “New types of aircraft make new things possible. That’s

what makes today’s announcement so significant for the national carrier and for a country like Australia where air travel is crucial. The A350 and Project Sunrise will make any city just one flight away from Australia. It’s the last frontier and the final fix for the tyranny of distance.”

“The A320s and A220s will become the backbone of our domestic fleet for the next 20 years, helping to keep this country moving. Their range and economics will make new direct routes possible. “The Board’s decision to green light what is the largest aircraft order in Australian aviation is a clear vote of confidence in the future of Qantas.”

Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer and Head of Airbus International said: ""Qantas is one of the world’s iconic airlines, with a visionary spirit from its inception over 100 years ago. We are honoured by the confidence that Qantas is placing in Airbus and look forward to delivering to the Group one of the world’s most modern, efficient and sustainable fleets. This decision by Qantas underscores the position of the A350 as the reference long range widebody aircraft.""

The A220, A321XLR and A350 are the market leaders in their respective size categories. In addition to offering the highest levels of passenger comfort, the aircraft bring a step change in efficiency, using up to 25% less fuel, a similar reduction in carbon emissions and a noise footprint 50% lower than previous generation aircraft.

All in-production Airbus aircraft are certified to fly with a 50% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blend, with a target to increase this to 100% by 2030.

Polar Ice and Snow monitoring mission CRISTAL on track - Airbus,"Tue, 24 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wNS1wb2xhci1pY2UtYW5kLXNub3ctbW9uaXRvcmluZy1taXNzaW9uLWNyaXN0YWwtb24tdHJhY2vSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus-built Copernicus satellite successfully passes Preliminary Design Review

CRISTAL will measure sea ice thickness and ice sheet elevations

Friedrichshafen, 24 May 2022 - The Copernicus Polar Ice and Snow Topography Altimetry mission CRISTAL is clearly on track. Following an intensive review process the European Space Agency ESA has confirmed that the preliminary design of the satellite meets all system requirements.

CRISTAL will carry an advanced multi-frequency altimeter that will measure sea ice thickness and ice sheet elevations - key climate change indicators. The CRISTAL altimeter will for the first time measure snow coverage of the ice sheets which will improve data quality significantly compared to its predecessor CryoSat-2. These data will support maritime operations in polar oceans and contribute to a better understanding of climate processes.

The Preliminary Design Review (PDR) was organised using a new more collaborative format. As a first step an extensive review by over 60 ESA engineers of a comprehensive data package, established by more than 100 engineers led by Airbus took place over four weeks. In a second step the major findings were intensively discussed in an interactive way between senior level experts both on ESA and Industry side up to the successful completion of the review.

CRISTAL will also support applications related to coastal and inland waters and the observation of ocean topography. The mission will ensure the long-term continuation of radar altimetry ice elevation and topographic change records, following on from previous missions such as ESA’s Earth Explorer CryoSat, also developed by Airbus and working flawlessly for 12 years, well beyond its design lifetime. Monitoring the cryosphere is essential to fully assess, predict and adapt to climate variability and change.

The 1.7 ton spacecraft is based on a proven, robust Airbus satellite design building on the heritage from Sentinel-6 and CryoSat. Six fixed and two deployable solar arrays - 18.6 m² in total - ensure enough power on CRISTAL´s drifting polar orbit at 699 km above the Earth. Its on-board memory will be able to store up to 4 terabits of science data at once, providing scientists with a wealth of information during its 7.5 year lifetime.

The Airbus Defence and Space site in Friedrichshafen (Germany) is heading an industrial consortium involving companies from 19 countries to deliver the project, including Thales Alenia Space to provide the IRIS Interferometric Radar Altimeter. Following the successful PDR the CRISTAL project is now on track for the Critical Design Review (CDR) scheduled for May 2024. The satellite platform and instrument will then be integrated and tested in the new, highly digitalised integration centre at Airbus in Friedrichshafen. CRISTAL is currently scheduled for launch from the European spaceport in Kourou in 2027.

Airbus expands its training portfolio to include Evidence Based Training - Airbus Aircraft,"Tue, 03 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vYWlyY3JhZnQuYWlyYnVzLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzcm9vbS9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy8yMDIyLTA1LWFpcmJ1cy1leHBhbmRzLWl0cy10cmFpbmluZy1wb3J0Zm9saW8tdG8taW5jbHVkZS1ldmlkZW5jZS1iYXNlZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Orlando, FL, 03 May 2022 – Airbus is expanding its flight training portfolio, by extending its Competency Based [pilot] Training and Assessment (CBTA) offer to include Evidence Based Training (EBT). This new flight training concept will enable airlines to incorporate operational and training data in order to adapt training programmes for technical and non-technical skills accordingly.

EBT is currently being offered as an option to customers as an alternative to Recurrent Training & Checking (RTC) for pilots - traditionally a method that is oriented towards tasks and task-based training and assessment, or as an enhancement to CBTA - a technique which has been well implemented across the aviation industry since its launch by ICAO in the 2000s - that focuses on assessing the pilots’ performance, developing specific pilot competencies and providing pilots with targeted individual training needs, such as decision making and workload management.

A New Trend in Flight Training

In addition to this, EBT also addresses new regulations that are being recommended / made mandatory by Airworthiness Authorities around the world in acknowledgement of the innovations in aircraft technology and developments in aircraft operations that pilots are being faced with.

The appetite for EBT is being led by China, following requirements imposed by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), who in 2020 launched a roadmap requiring all Chinese airlines to implement CBTA/EBT training by 2024.

Loong Air Becomes First Adopter

To that end, Airbus confirms that the fastest growing airline in China, Loong Air, operating scheduled passenger and cargo services out Hangzhou Airport is the first customer to sign for the EBT service offering.

“We’re proud to be the launch customer for Airbus’ Evidence Based Training, and the first airline in China to step into the new era of flight training,” said LIU Qihong, Chairman of Loong Air.

The Airbus EBT Service is a flexible training solution for customers, as the training can be done by the airline, it does not have to physically take place in an [Airbus] Training Centre, providing their instructors are trained to Airbus standards and that they are equipped with Full Flight Simulators.

Data Analytics as an Enabler

In order to implement EBT, Airbus has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the French based training data analytics company, Hinfact. The deployment of EBT involves Airbus and the airlines acquiring Hinfact’s specific training software compatible with any training data source, tablet and Full Flight Simulator (FFS).

By combining operational data from the airline, plus training session data from FFS sessions, Hinfact software uses data analytics to identify competency improvement areas and suggest customised training sessions accordingly.

Airbus has been offering training courses since its creation some 50 years ago and has always taken a comprehensive and innovative approach via its unique cockpit commonality concept and the regular introduction of the latest technologies or learning concepts.



The Airbus (flight and maintenance) training network currently counts 18 locations, plus 2 flight schools, around the world. This extensive global network enables Airbus to offer a complete flight training package, allowing its customers to benefit from its training expertise closer to their home base."
Airbus and Boeing Report April 2022 Commercial Aircraft Orders and Deliveries - Defense & Security Monitor,"Mon, 23 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vZHNtLmZvcmVjYXN0aW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC5jb20vMjAyMi8wNS8yMy9haXJidXMtYW5kLWJvZWluZy1yZXBvcnQtYXByaWwtMjAyMi1jb21tZXJjaWFsLWFpcmNyYWZ0LW9yZGVycy1hbmQtZGVsaXZlcmllcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"777X first delivery postponed; pushed out another two years. Airbus targets 75 A320neos per month by 2025.

by J. Kasper Oestergaard, European Correspondent, Forecast International.

Boeing and Airbus delivered 35 and 48 commercial jets in April 2022, compared to 17 and 45 deliveries, respectively, in the same month last year. Year-to-date, Boeing and Airbus have delivered 130 and 190 aircraft, compared to 94 and 170, respectively, in the first four months of 2021. So far this year, Boeing and Airbus are 36 and 20 deliveries ahead of last year’s totals to date.

Following a more than challenging 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2021 was a year of recovery for the two largest commercial plane makers. 2022 is well underway and is expected to be another year of recovery for the commercial aircraft manufacturing industry, despite events currently unfolding in Ukraine. Boeing and Airbus still have a long way to go before deliveries are back to pre-pandemic levels, though.

For the full year 2021, Boeing delivered 340 aircraft, compared to 157 in 2020 and 380 in 2019. Boeing’s last “normal” year was 2018 – before COVID-19 and the 737 MAX grounding – when it delivered 806 jets, a level that will likely not be recaptured before 2024 or 2025. The past three years have been extremely challenging for Boeing but, despite ongoing Dreamliner quality issues and 777X delays, the outlook is now looking brighter than at any time since March 2019, when the second 737 MAX crash occurred. Orders are strong and deliveries have surged from the 2020 lows, with another sharp increase expected this year.

The 737 MAX is approved to fly in nearly every country, and since late 2020, the fleet has flown more than one million flight hours. The aircraft, however, has not yet returned to commercial service in China despite the fact that the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) ungrounded the 737 MAX in December of last year. For example, China Eastern Airlines recently announced that aircraft modifications and further pilot training are needed before it can resume commercial service with the aircraft. The top reason for the 737 MAX’s absence in the skies over China is most likely the nation’s zero-COVID approach, which continues to wreak havoc on domestic air travel.

In 2021, Airbus delivered 611 aircraft and won the deliveries crown for the third year in a row. Deliveries were up from 566 in 2020 but remain well below the company’s all-time record high of 863 shipments in 2019. Airbus is expected to retain the deliveries lead for the foreseeable future due to the company’s comfortable backlog lead over its American rival. Prior to 2019, Boeing had out-delivered Airbus every year since 2012.

As indicated above, in April 2022, Boeing delivered 35 jets, including 29 737s (28 MAX / 1 NG), one 747, two 767s, and three 777s. The 737 program is currently officially producing at a rate of 27 per month, up from 19 as of the end of October 2021, and will reach the company’s near-term target of 31 per month in the second quarter. According to Reuters, Boeing has preliminary plans to boost 737 production to 38 jets per month in the first half of 2023, followed by an increase to 47 jets per month by the end of 2023.

Dreamliner deliveries have now been suspended for nearly a year, and it is unknown when shipments will resume. Boeing suspended Dreamliner deliveries in May 2021 for the second time in less than a year. The FAA is reviewing Boeing’s method for inspecting and evaluating the aircraft to ensure it meets federal safety regulations. In February, the head of the FAA, Steve Dickson, stated that the agency needs a “systemic fix” from Boeing to address Dreamliner production issues and would not allow the company to self-certify individual new jets when deliveries resume. However, the FAA has acknowledged that Boeing is heading in the right direction.

The FAA wants Boeing to ensure it has a robust plan for the rework that it performs on a large number of new 787s in storage and demonstrate that its delivery processes are stable. According to Boeing, the company is continuing to complete comprehensive inspections across the 787 production system and within the supply chain, while holding detailed, transparent discussions with the FAA, suppliers, and customers. The company continues to perform rework on 787 airplanes in inventory and is engaged in detailed discussions with the FAA.

In late April, Dave Calhoun, Boeing’s president and CEO, announced that rework has been completed on the initial 787s and that the company continues to work closely with the FAA on timing of resuming deliveries. Other important progress on the 787 was made when Boeing recently submitted its certification plan to the FAA. At the end of last year, Boeing had 110 Dreamliners in storage (manufactured but not yet certified). The current 787 production rate is approximately two aircraft per month, and Boeing expects to continue at this rate until deliveries resume and then return to five per month over time. In March, it was reported that the company is currently testing the ability of suppliers to meet output scenarios as high as seven per month by the end of 2023.

The 777 program was expected to get a new addition in late 2023 with the first delivery of the 777X, but in April Boeing announced this will now not happen before 2025. This reflects an updated assessment of the time required to meet certification requirements. According to Boeing, the 777-9 production rate ramp-up is being adjusted to minimize inventory and the number of airplanes requiring “change incorporation,” including a temporary pause through 2023. However, Boeing is taking advantage of the adjustment to the 777-9 production schedule by adding 777 freighter capacity starting in late 2023. In January of this year, Boeing launched a new 777X-based freighter, thereby expanding its 777X and cargo portfolio. Qatar Airways will be the 777-8F launch customer.

In April 2022, Airbus delivered 48 jets, including four A220s, 37 A320s (all NEO), two A330s, and five A350s. During 2021, Airbus steadily increased A320 production from 40 per month to 43 in Q3 2021 before finishing the year at a rate of 45 per month. Production will continue to be increased until reaching a monthly rate of 65 by the summer of 2023. Airbus has also discussed a scenario with a rate of 70 by Q1 2024. On May 4, Guillaume Faury, the CEO of Airbus, announced that the company continues to see strong growth in commercial aircraft demand driven by the A320 family. As a result, Airbus is now working with its supply chain to increase the A320 production rate to 75 aircraft per month in 2025. On the A321XLR program, Airbus continues to work toward a first flight by the end of Q2 2022. The entry-into-service, initially planned for the end of 2023, is now expected to take place in early 2024.

The A220, meanwhile, is being produced at a rate of five aircraft per month. The rate will be increased to six in the coming months – with a monthly production rate of 14 envisioned by the middle of the decade. The A350 production rate currently averages five per month and will be increased to six by early 2023. Airbus is currently producing two A330s per month, a rate that will be increased to nearly three aircraft by the end of 2022.

In 2021, Airbus launched the new A350 freighter, or A350F, which is a major and much-needed boost to the company’s competitiveness in the cargo segment. Boeing has long dominated the cargo space with its 737-800BCF, 767-300BCF, 767-300F, 777F, 777-8F and 747-8F offerings. Until now, Airbus has only offered the A330-200F, which has not performed well in competition against Boeing’s popular 767-300F. With the launch of the A350F, it appears Airbus is getting serious about capturing more of the cargo aircraft market. The A350F, which carries up to 120 tons (109 metric tons) of cargo, received its first order in November and will predominantly compete with the 777F. In comparison, the 777F has a cargo capacity of up to 112 tons (102 metric tons).

Recently, Airbus urged European leaders to not impose sanctions on titanium imports from Russia. Airbus argues that sanctions on the metal would damage aerospace in Europe while barely hurting the Russian economy. Airbus relies on Russia for half its titanium needs, compared to one-third for Boeing. In early March, Boeing said it had suspended Russian titanium purchases. Despite this challenge, Airbus has announced that its titanium sourcing needs are covered in the short and medium terms and recently reaffirmed its 2022 guidance. However, the company is accelerating its search for non-Russian supplies. Both Airbus and Boeing have been stockpiling titanium in recent months.

Turning to the April orders review, Boeing had a satisfactory month and booked four orders for a total of 46 jets. The company, however, also reported 34 cancellations (32 737 MAXs and two 787s), resulting in only 12 net new orders in total. The largest order was for 29 737 MAXs for an undisclosed customer, followed by an order from Aviation Capital Group for nine 737 MAX jets. Finally, AerCap ordered six 737 MAXs and an undisclosed customer booked two 777Fs. Year-to-date, Boeing has accumulated 157 net new orders (213 gross orders). In 2021, Boeing booked 909 gross orders and received 430 cancellations, for a total of 479 net new orders (before ASC 606 changes). In 2020, Boeing accumulated a total of 184 gross orders and received 655 cancellations, for a total of -471 net new orders.

Due to events unfolding in Ukraine and sanctions on aircraft deliveries to Russia, Boeing expects that up to 141 jets it has on order – 90 of which are 737 MAX aircraft – could be affected and eventually removed from its books. Please note that for comparison reasons, we do not include these so-called ASC 606 accounting adjustments in the numbers reported in this article and regard net new orders as gross orders minus cancellations.

Airbus reported a strong order haul in April and booked five orders for a total of 98 jets. The company only reported three cancellations (two A321neos and one A350-1000), resulting in an impressive 95 net new orders. In April, Singapore-based aircraft leasing company BOC Aviation ordered 80 Airbus A320neo family aircraft, comprising 10 A321XLRs, 50 A321neos, and 20 A320neos. Also of note were Air France’s order for four A350 freighters and an order for two A319neos and six A320neos placed by an undisclosed customer.

Year-to-date, Airbus has accumulated 178 net new orders (351 gross orders). In 2021, Airbus booked a total of 771 gross orders and received 264 cancellations, for a total of 507 net new orders – enough to win the orders crown for the third year in a row. It should be noted, however, that if Boeing’s 2021 ASC 606 adjustments are included, Boeing comes out ahead with 535 net new orders. In 2020, Airbus accumulated 383 gross orders and received 115 cancellations, for a total of 268 net new orders.

At the end of April 2022, Airbus reported a backlog of 7,070 jets, of which 6,408, or 91 percent, were A220 and A320ceo/neo family narrowbodies. This is 655 aircraft below the company’s all-time backlog record of 7,725 aircraft set in January 2020. By the end of April, Boeing’s backlog (total unfilled orders before ASC 606 adjustment) was 5,163 aircraft, of which 4,154, or 80 percent, were 737 NG/MAX narrowbody jets. Boeing’s all-time backlog high of 5,964 aircraft was set in August 2018. The number of Airbus aircraft to be built and delivered represents 8.2 years of shipments at the 2019 production level (the pre-pandemic level), or 11.6 years based on the 2021 total. In comparison, Boeing’s backlog would “only” last 6.4 years at the 2018 level (the most recent “normal” year for Boeing), or 15.2 years based on 2021 deliveries. In 2022 to date, Boeing’s book-to-bill ratio, calculated as net new orders divided by deliveries, is 1.21. Airbus’ book-to-bill ratio is 0.94. In 2021, Boeing’s book-to-bill ratio was 1.41, while Airbus reported a book-to-bill of 0.81.

2022 Forecast

Forecast International’s Platinum Forecast System is a breakthrough in forecasting technology that provides 15-year production forecasts. The author has used the Platinum Forecast System to retrieve the latest delivery forecast data from the Civil Aircraft Forecast product. For 2022, Forecast International’s analysts currently expect Boeing and Airbus to deliver 450 and 702 commercial jets, respectively. Compared to the 2021 level, this is a 32.4 percent increase for Boeing and a 14.9 percent increase for Airbus.

In January, Boeing reported Q4 and full-year 2021 earnings and operating results but did not provide any guidance on expected 2022 deliveries. The company released first quarter 2022 results on April 27 but did not provide any updated guidance on deliveries. Airbus reported 2021 earnings on February 17 and expects to deliver 720 commercial aircraft in 2022. As the basis for its 2022 guidance, Airbus assumes no further disruptions to the world economy, air traffic, and its own internal operations. The company released Q1 2022 earnings on May 4 and reaffirmed its 2022 guidance.

Airbus set to expand in Mobile - Business Alabama,"Thu, 05 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3NhbGFiYW1hLmNvbS9haXJidXMtc2V0LXRvLWV4cGFuZC1pbi1tb2JpbGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With a bull market for Airbus aircraft, the European plane maker announced plans Wednesday to increase production of the popular A320 model — including expansion at the firm’s plant in Mobile.

“Commercial aircraft production for the A320 Family is progressing towards a monthly rate of 65 aircraft by summer 2023, in a complex environment,” the company said in its quarterly earnings release. “Following an analysis of global customer demand as well as an assessment of the industrial ecosystem’s readiness, the company is now working with its suppliers and partners to enable monthly production rates of 75 in 2025.

“This production increase will benefit the entire global industrial value chain. Airbus will meet the higher production rates by increasing capacity at its existing industrial sites and growing the industrial footprint in Mobile, U.S., while investing to ensure that all commercial aircraft assembly sites are A321-capable.”

The proposed increase in production would boost output from about 50 A320-family planes a month now to 65 a month by the middle of 2023 and 75 a month in 2025, Reuters reported.

“The decision will lead to a second A320-family assembly line in Mobile, Alabama,” Reuters added, “increasing the European manufacturer’s presence in arch-rival Boeing’s backyard. So far, Airbus has nine current or planned lines in Europe, the U.S. and China.”

Airbus already operates two final assembly lines in Mobile — the original producing A320-family planes and the second producing the smaller A220-family jets.

While reassuring European partners that major production will remain in Europe, Reuters reported, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury told reporters: “We can go faster in Mobile and will be gaining critical mass. It will benefit the whole ecosystem of Airbus and benefit all our sites.”"
Defending Europe's borders - Airbus,"Mon, 30 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTA1LWRlZmVuZGluZy1ldXJvcGVzLWJvcmRlcnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Russian invasion of Ukraine has ushered in a new age of conflict and violence on Europe’s borders. For the past three months, we have woken up every day to the reality of warfare, inflicted on a country of 44 million people; a sovereign nation, let us remember, with aspirations to join the European Union as a liberal democracy.

Our role and priority, whether as business leaders, policymakers or as European citizens, is to support the people of Ukraine in their hour of need and alleviate their suffering.

The invasion has brought rapid geo-political change. Within Europe, it has triggered a collective awakening. Europeans are standing shoulder to shoulder like never before. Many more people now realise that peace and stability are fragile and must be defended.

Meanwhile, we see once again that governments, businesses and civil society must address global crises together. This has been the lesson of COVID-19, the climate emergency and the economic crisis of 2007-8. The era of unilateralism is over, hopefully never to return.

Our armed forces play an indispensable role in guaranteeing the security and stability we all depend on. But they have suffered from a lack of funding and coordination, calling into question their readiness for the kind of high-intensity conflict unfolding in Ukraine. In recent weeks, Europe’s leaders have moved quickly to put this right. In doing so, they have the opportunity to shape the European defence landscape for decades to come.

The signs are encouraging. In March, the EU Council endorsed the first ever EU Strategic Compass on defence, following an assessment of the risks of the future. Proposals include equipping European defence with new capabilities, such as a rapid deployment force, increased funding, improved cyber security and the strengthening of partnerships with critical allies like NATO and the UK. All of which would leave the EU better placed to respond to current and future threats to its borders.

In the same month, the Versailles summit of Europe’s leaders called for the Commission to propose urgent measures to strengthen Europe’s defence industrial base. The Commission has answered with concrete, innovative suggestions to encourage the joint procurement and funding of military equipment in Europe - something that has been frustrated by legal or budgetary technicalities for too long. These proposals will be debated and, hopefully, endorsed at the upcoming EU Council meeting on 30-31 May.

Why does European defence cooperation matter? Europe is blessed with a defence industry that is competitive on the global stage. The industry will play a vital role in realising the EU’s defence ambitions by developing the defence and security systems of the future. There’s no question we have the skills and technological capabilities. But progress will ultimately be determined by our ability to forge the deep, strategic partnerships that have underpinned our sector’s past successes.

To understand why cooperation matters, you only have to look at the next generation of defence systems. The Future Combat Air System, a partnership between France, Germany and Spain - and one that must be informed by a true spirit of cooperation - will encompass new combat and unmanned aircraft, satellite technology, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and much more. It’s an integrated defence system on a scale unimaginable even 20 years ago.

Such a project cannot be developed by one European country alone. We need to pool our expertise and financial resources to bring it to fruition. In Europe, we are stronger together and not when we fall back behind national borders and interests. The Commission’s latest proposals would foster this cooperation.

But it’s not just about the more distant future. Europe’s defence industry is already producing equipment that supports Europe’s strategic autonomy. Strategic and tactical transport aircraft, manufactured across Europe, could, for example, be a vital part of a European rapid deployment force. European industry also has expertise in unmanned aerial systems that could strengthen border surveillance in the bloc. The EU now has the opportunity to realise this potential and smooth the path of joint procurement and investment.

Finally, Europe’s defence industry needs access to finance. Some people have called for defence businesses to be excluded from financial services on the grounds that, by the very nature of their activities, they are socially irresponsible businesses. But recent events have proven otherwise. European democracy must be defended with hard military power. And the threats to our way of life are real. The financial sector should be encouraged to support security and defence.

Europe has responded to the invasion of Ukraine with a startling unity of purpose: it should now extend this to European defence policy. There is so much at stake, today in Ukraine and tomorrow for us all. Peace and stability are the foundation of European democracy, the rule of law, prosperity and human progress.

By embracing the Strategic Compass and endorsing the commission’s new proposals, Europe can strengthen its defence capabilities at a time of uncertainty. To those hostile to our values, we can send a powerful message about our shared commitment to defending them.

Front-line aircraft mechanics - Airbus,"Tue, 03 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIyLTA1LWZyb250LWxpbmUtYWlyY3JhZnQtbWVjaGFuaWNz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“There will be a massive demand for aircraft maintenance technicians and engineers over the next 15 to 20 years, but the risk of shortages is real,” explained Christophe Ponnet, the Maintenance Training Operations Director for Airbus Customer Services. “This is due to such factors as the retirement of today’s ageing maintenance personnel, the COVID-19 pandemic’s effects on hiring and training, as well as less enthusiasm for a job that may not have esteem as being a pilot.”

700,000+ maintenance personnel needed by 2035

The Airbus Global Market Forecast – which is well known for its evaluation of the airline industry’s aircraft needs during 20-year time periods – also assesses the sector’s workforce, and the most recent survey estimated a need for over 700,000 new aircraft maintenance technicians and engineers by 2040.

To assist the airline and maintenance industry sector, Airbus has launched a programme to support academies in bringing initial and basic training efforts upstream in the education path. This initiative includes providing access to modern training and supporting material – responding to aviation’s highly digital environment – along with new teaching solutions that are more attractive to a new generation.

apprentices

By applying the Airbus solution, training schools can be brought up to the qualification levels required by national and international airworthiness authorities. Within this scope, it can support the setting up of a school’s maintenance training organisation and the associated documentation; define recommendations for classrooms, labs and other facilities; along with training of the management, quality and instructor teams.

Innovative virtual and interactive training tools

A key element of the offer is Airbus Competence Training (ACT) for Academy. This is a version of the ACT suite already deployed at the home bases of airline customers around the world to type qualify their mechanics on Airbus-built aircraft in the fleets. Using innovative virtual and interactive tools, the ACT for Academy solution encompasses a 3D virtual Airbus aircraft, including virtual cockpit, virtual engines and a walk-around trainer; scenario-driven exercises to perform typical aircraft systems maintenance tasks; and general familiarisation using Airbus courseware to present and explain the aircraft.

Christophe Ponnet said Airbus already is collaborating with a number of organisations, schools and universities around the world. “We’re looking to widen this network to help partners prepare the new generation,” Christophe Ponnet concluded. “The added benefit is to reinforce the partners’ academic prestige with their use of an official Airbus solution.”

1000 new jobs: Airbus confirms third assembly line for Mobile - AL.com,"Mon, 09 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsLmNvbS9uZXdzL21vYmlsZS8yMDIyLzA1LzEwMDAtbmV3LWpvYnMtYWlyYnVzLWNvbmZpcm1zLXRoaXJkLWFzc2VtYmx5LWxpbmUtZm9yLW1vYmlsZS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus executives confirmed Monday that it will raise a third aircraft assembly line in Mobile over the next few years, but there’s more: 1,000 new jobs on the new line, with new training programs operated by Bishop State Community College and Baldwin County public schools helping to meet the demand for skilled employees.

A top company official also said that despite recent signals from Pentagon officials, he thinks Airbus will get a shot at an Air Force tanker contract that could mean a fourth assembly line for the Port City.

The news about a new assembly line began to break on Friday, as Airbus announced quarterly earnings and revealed plans to boost production of its A320 family well beyond pre-pandemic levels. It wants its suppliers to be ready to help it put out 75 of the jetliners per month by 2025, it said.

Airbus assembles A320-family jets at four locations around the world, and company statements said the ramp-up would involve some expansion in Mobile. Taking questions on an earnings call, Faury clarified that this would mean a new Final Assembly Line (FAL) in Mobile, alongside the one that already assembles A320 family jets and a newer one for the smaller A220 family.

Jeff Knittel, Airbus Americas Chairman and CEO, spelled it out on Monday, in a ceremony held in the brand-new Advanced Manufacturing Technology Center on Bishop State Community College’s campus off Broad Street.

“The next step in our journey is an increase in the rate of production at Airbus for our single-aisle family … We have globally decided that we’re going to increase the rate of our 320 family to 75 airplanes,” said Knittel. “And because of that, we will build an additional Final Assembly Line right here in Mobile.”

Knittel projected a groundbreaking for the new FAL in the first quarter of 2023, with production to start in early 2025. “It’s driven by the demand of our customers and the growing demand right here in the U.S.,” he said.

An Airbus spokesman said the company has not yet released any estimate of how much it will invest to build the new FAL.

“Now, not only will it be a Final Assembly Line, but we’ll add a new paint shop and we’ll have major modifications to our existing hangar,” Knittel said. “But most importantly, to you and others, we will hire an additional 1,000 employees. And our plan is to continue to do that with a diverse population just like we have here at Bishop State. So we look forward to you graduating and helping us succeed.”

As Knittel and others spoke, they were flanked by dozens of area high school students who’ve been in Airbus’ FlightPath9, an afterschool training program that prepares students to go into a “Fast Track” employee training program. The expectation appears to be that at least some of the FlightPath9 students will learn additional skills at the new Bishop State facility. There, said interim Bishop State President Lawrence Brandenburg, they and others will receive “industry-approved training through Airbus.”

Brandyburg described the Advanced Manufacturing Technology Center as a state of the art facility that will be the only one of its kind in the region. It will feature “new groundbreaking programs that will train students for high-tech careers in electronics, engineering, computer-aided drafting and design, mechatronics, robotics, and much more.”

Knittel and others expressed personal enthusiasm. Knittel said that starting higher education with a year at a community college had been a pivotal moment in shaping his career path. Daryl Taylor, Airbus FAL USA Vice President and General Manager, said much the same of an early training program he experienced.

“As a former apprentice, I know the impact serving as an apprentice had on my career,” he said.

“The way forward for you is being paved in a way that’s never happened,” said Mobile Mayor Sandy Stimpson. Other speakers included Baldwin County Commission Chair Jeb Ball, who said that a new career tech school in Loxley will prepare Baldwin County High School students “to join the workforce as soon as they graduate” in trades such as “construction sciences, healthcare sciences as well as aerospace studies.”

Other speakers included Gov. Kay Ivey and Mobile County Commission President Connie Hudson. A common theme was the teamwork of state and local elected officials.

While Airbus is free to chart its own path on the civilian side of the industry, its chances of producing tankers for the U.S. Air Force depend largely on Pentagon decision-makers.

A decade ago, Boeing and Airbus predecessor EADS went toe-to-toe for a big U.S. Air Force tanker deal known as the KC-X contract. A so-called KC-Y contract has been anticipated as a rematch; and in February Airbus described its plan to build a new assembly line in Mobile if it wins the deal.

The latest news on that front is that in late March, a top Pentagon official said the competition might not happen, because the Air Force might just keep buying Boeing’s KC-46, winner of the previous competition.

“I love competition. I’m all for it. It’s the best tool have to reduce costs. But we actually have to have a demand for the other aircraft that’s being offered,” Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said during a House Armed Services Committee hearing, according to Breaking Defense.

“And I’m trying to be as transparent and honest about this as I can be. It is not as certain as it was a year ago, let’s say, that we’re going to do a competition,” Kendall said, according to Breaking Defense. “And I don’t want people to have a mis-impression about that. [But] we have not made a final decision yet.”

Kendall basically said that the closer the Air Force gets to nailing down exactly what it wants, the more it looks like more of the same. “As we look for requirements, look further out, the requirements start to look like a modified KC-46 more than they do a completely new design,” Kendall said, according to Aviation Week.

That sat poorly with U.S. Rep. Jerry Carl, among others whose districts would benefit from Airbus’s tanker partnership with Lockheed Martin, according to Breaking Defense and other outlets. They’ve pointed out that Boeing’s effort to get the KC-46 into service has been plagued by a seemingly endless series of manufacturing and design problems, some of which have had massive price tags.

On Monday, Knittel said he feels confident the competition will take place. “I do. We’re moving forward,” he said.

“A campaign like this has ups and downs, and different views,” he said. “We fundamentally believe we have the right airplane for our warfighters going forward.”"
Airbus to open new Mobile A320 production site in 2025 - Flightglobal,"Mon, 09 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyZnJhbWVycy9haXJidXMtdG8tb3Blbi1uZXctbW9iaWxlLWEzMjAtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1zaXRlLWluLTIwMjUvMTQ4NTczLmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus plans to build a new A320 final assembly facility in Mobile, Alabama, and to have the site operating by the second quarter of 2025.

The Toulouse-based airframer disclosed the timeline and other details on 9 May.

Last week, Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury revealed that the company planned to open a second A320 final assembly line (FAL) in Mobile, but he provided no details.

“Current plans call for breaking ground on the new FAL in the first half of 2023,” Airbus now says. “We expect to start production within the new FAL by Q2 of 2025.”

The new “building” will have 32,516sq m (350,000sq ft) of space and employ about 1,000 people, Airbus says.

Additionally, by the end of 2023 Airbus intends to build a new paint facility in Mobile and to modify its existing hangars to what it calls a “double-bay configuration”.

The paint shop and hangar modifications will “support increased production at the site,” Airbus says.

The company now has one A320 final assembly line and one A220 final assembly line in Mobile.

Airbus Americas CEO Jeff Knittel disclosed details about the expansion during an event in Mobile on 9 May.

Also last week, Faury said Airbus intends to ramp A320neo-family production to 65 jets monthly by summer 2023, and to 75 monthly in 2025

Airbus delivered an average of about 37 A320neo-family jets in the first three months of 2022."

DALLAS – Things will be getting busier in Mobile, Alabama. Airbus is looking to start an aggressive growth plan at its assembly facility there.

According to a report on al.com, the plane manufacturer has said that it will add a third assembly line at its Brookley Aeroplex on the shore of Mobile Bay. It currently assembles A320s and A220s at the facility. The third line would provide additional capacity for A320s.

Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury told US News & World Report that a second A320 assembly line was in the plans for Mobile. The company on Wednesday said that “Mobile will play a key role in Airbus’ plans to significantly increase global production rates in coming years.”

An official “economic investment and workforce announcement” is scheduled for Monday in Mobile.

Airbus is also competing for an Air Force tanker contract and, if won, would assemble those jets in Mobile as well.

Ramp up Production

In its quarterly earnings report yesterday, Airbus noted that it was staying with and even accelerating A320 production that was slowed by the pandemic. It hopes to produce 65 A320s per month by mid-2023, and it is working with suppliers to ramp that up to 75 per month by 2025.

These numbers stand in stark contrast to the production of Boeing 737s which remains at just over 30 planes per month.

“Airbus will meet the higher production rates by increasing capacity at its existing industrial sites and growing the industrial footprint in Mobile, AL while investing to ensure that all commercial aircraft assembly sites are A321-capable,” said the earnings report.

Richard Aboulafia, an analyst for the consultant AeroDynamic Advisory, said, “The market for single-aisle jets is extremely strong, and the A321neo is doing particularly well.” Airbus’ objective is to gain 70% of that market, leaving only 30% for Boeing, “And they just might get there.”

"Honeywell, Thales developing connected FMS for A320, A330 and A350 - - Runway Girl Network","Tue, 24 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjIvMDUvYWlyYnVzLW5leHRnZW4tZm1zLWEzMjAtYTMzMC1hMzUwLWVmYi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has selected two longtime avionics competitors, Honeywell and Thales, to provide the nextgen flight management system for new A320, A330 and A350 twinjets, with service entry planned for the end of 2026. Airlines will have the option to choose either system when ordering their aircraft.

A key part of the European airframer’s plan is to link the FMS for these aircraft platforms with non-avionics systems, such as the pilot’s Electronic Flight Bag and airline operational control centers. The EFB will access onboard connectivity to deliver real-time weather and other performance-enhancing applications.

But granular specifics are still being thrashed out.

“Airbus plans to include connectivity via an onboard EFB, and Honeywell will be collaborating with Airbus to create and enable connected features and apps, but the exact details of the final product and the approach are to be confirmed,” a Honeywell spokesperson tells Runway Girl Network when asked if Honeywell expects that secure L-band satellite services from Inmarsat and Iridium will power the EFB or if there will be an opportunity to talk to the broadband connectivity pipes available to passengers.

A longtime provider of FMS systems to Airbus, Honeywell’s press release notes that its new system combines multiple current FMS offerings for the airframer into one single solution for the A320 family, A330 and A350. “Importantly, the new FMS hardware is 15 times more capable than current hardware and enables a path to future enhancements without hardware changes,” says Honeywell. A retrofit solution based on the same core hardware and common software is also planned for the A320 and A330.

For its part, Thales notes in a published statement that by linking the new FMS with non-avionics systems, the solution “makes it quicker and easier to analyze flight plan revisions, providing the pilot with the best route and simplifying interaction with air traffic control”.

In 2019, Thales unveiled the basis for this nextgen FMS, called PureFlyt, to various media outlets including Runway Girl Network. At that time, management spoke excitedly about the prospect of ultimately using a segregated channel of broadband cabin connectivity to ensure high-bandwidth applications can be supported, but it tempered enthusiasm by noting that a lot of standards and regulatory work still needs to be done before we can even consider such a reality.

Any true safety services, as defined by ICAO, will continue to be transmitted over approved pipes, noted Thales management at the time. Crucially, it said that by combining the integrity of the FMS and the agility and power of EFB flight functionalities, aircraft trajectory can be permanently controlled, adapted and enhanced, resulting in optimized flight, decreased fuel consumption and improved passenger comfort.

The current FMS on both the A320 series and A330 are understood to be selectable supplier furnished equipment (SSFE) with Airbus standard systems available from Honeywell and Thales.

In an informational brochure about its prior-release FMS systems for Airbus, Honeywell states: “While the core FMS functionality is specified by Airbus, the two offerings from the suppliers do have features and functionalities that differ somewhat. Some differences that exist in the software are attributable to the development programs operating independently and not in lock step, and stem from the fact that one supplier, Honeywell, generally leads FMS innovation activities reflected by the Airbus award of sole source supply to Honeywell for its most recent new aircraft programs (A380, and A350).”

When asked by RGN if there are any notable differences between the new Honeywell and Thales FMS systems for the A320, A330 and A350, and if an opportunity exists for Honeywell to differentiate itself with its nextgen platform, the Honeywell spokesman says: “ We are unable to comment on Thales’s systems and it is a question best addressed by them.”

Though Honeywell has clearly enjoyed strong positioning in the A350 cockpit, Airbus has in recent years turned to Thales for some new kit, for instance selecting the French multinational firm to provide an integrated touchscreen display for the A350 flight deck.

In their latest messaging about developing the new FMS across Airbus types, both Honeywell and Thales each speak about their legacies in providing avionics to Airbus platforms.

“Honeywell has been supplying flight management systems since Airbus’ first A300 went into service, and this win will extend our 35-year partnership well into the future,” says the aerospace giant.

“More than 6,000 aircraft worldwide are equipped with the current generation of Thales flight management systems,” a Thales spokesperson tells RGN. “These systems have clocked up a total of more than 100 million flight hours onboard ATR regional aircraft and A320, A330 and A340 commercial airliners, as well as military aircraft including the Atlantique 2 maritime patrol aircraft, the A400M transport plane, and UH-60V and S-76 helicopters.”

Honeywell's FMS family has already been deployed by Airbus on the A320, A330, A350 and A380 platforms. The new FMS is being developed to build upon millions of hours of Honeywell's FMS legacy, with enhanced modularity, advanced functionality, and a multi-core processing platform. At the completion of development, the new FMS will be a standalone federated system, making it easier for operators to support the fleet.

The FMS will be offered as a single standardized hardware and software platform that can be used across the Airbus A320, A330 and A350 aircraft fleet with expected entry into service by end of 2026. A retrofit solution based on the same core hardware and common software is also planned for the A320 and A330 fleet of aircraft. An FMS provides the primary navigation, flight planning, and optimized route determination and enroute guidance for an aircraft.

Final Pléiades Neo satellites ready to join rest of family - Airbus,"Wed, 18 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wNS1maW5hbC1wbGVpYWRlcy1uZW8tc2F0ZWxsaXRlcy1yZWFkeS10by1qb2luLXJlc3Qtb2YtZmFtaWx50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Integration completed, environment tests successfully passed

Dispenser-free launch configuration, clever ""auto-stackable"" design

Toulouse, 18 May 2022 - The last two satellites of the Airbus-built, owned and operated Pléiades Neo constellation are on track for launch later this year, following successful final tests in Toulouse’s clean rooms.

Following the seamless parallel integration of both Pléiades Neo 5 and 6 satellites, and the successful conclusion of the environment (thermal vacuum, acoustic, vibration) test campaign, both final spacecraft are now ready to complete the Pléiades Neo constellation.

Both satellites are due to be launched simultaneously on the Vega C European launcher from Kourou, in French Guiana. To tackle this dual launch, the Airbus space engineers came up with a smart and efficient dispenser-free design, where the satellites are stacked on top of each other, linked only by a clamp band.

This compact dispenser-free launch configuration saves volume and mass, as well as reducing cost. Simultaneously testing both satellites in their stacked launch configuration enabled significant time saving, with only four days needed to pass both the three axes Sine testing and the acoustic test.

”With this new bold, dispenser-free design, we were able to seamlessly integrate and test these two very high resolution satellites and ensure an optimised launch configuration: in a single launch, we will double the acquisition capacity of the Pléiades Neo constellation, and offer even greater responsiveness to our customers” said Philippe Pham, Head of Earth Observation and Science at Airbus.

About Pléiades Neo

Comprising four identical satellites, the Pléiades Neo constellation will work hand in hand with the existing Pléiades satellites and the rest of the Airbus Earth observation satellite fleet. The highly compact Pléiades Neo spacecraft have a light weight, next generation silicon carbide optical instrument. They also have laser comms inter-satellite links with SpaceDataHighway (EDRS) geostationary satellites to enable urgent acquisitions in just 30 to 40 minutes following a tasking request to swiftly respond to the most critical situations.

Lockheed Secretly Worked to Block Airbus' Influence in Washington—While Teaming on Major Pentagon Bid - Defense One,"Tue, 10 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWZlbnNlb25lLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIyLzA1L2xvY2toZWVkLXNlY3JldGx5LXdvcmtlZC1ibG9jay1haXJidXMtaW5mbHVlbmNlLXdhc2hpbmd0b253aGlsZS10ZWFtaW5nLW1ham9yLXBlbnRhZ29uLWJpZC8zNjY3ODcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Under a party tent at an airport in Mobile, Alabama, the CEO of Lockheed Martin grinned as he shook hands with the head of Airbus’s defense and space business unit.

It was late January, and Lockheed’s Jim Taiclet was welcoming Airbus’ Michael Schoellhorn, who had flown in from Europe to help announce a proposal to jointly build aerial refueling tankers at an Airbus plant in the Port City. The campaign-style rally was meant to stir up political support for their bid against Boeing to make the next batch of U.S. Air Force tankers; it had drawn Alabama’s governor, members of the state’s congressional delegation, and state and local officials, all excited by the prospect of hundreds of new jobs.

But back in Washington, Lockheed was quietly trying to block Airbus’ latest application to join the Aerospace Industries Association, an influential trade group that represents hundreds of mostly American companies ranging from multibillion-dollar manufacturers of fighter jets to tiny mom-and-pop suppliers.

Airbus, formed in 1970 when three European firms merged to better compete with American rivals, had applied for membership late last year. AIA’s CEO, Eric Fanning, had scheduled a discussion of that application before the group’s executive committee. That didn’t sit well with Lockheed, whose executives already had grown unhappy with Fanning’s leadership of the lobbying group.

“I remain troubled by how the application has been allowed to even get to the point where there will be an [executive committee] discussion next week,” Christian Marrone, Lockheed’s senior vice president of government affairs, wrote in a Feb. 18 email sent to Peter Prowitt, AIA’s chief operating officer, and copied to several other defense executives. Defense One reviewed the message, which was verified by two sources.

“From the time Airbus shared with AIA their intent to reapply, Eric should have strongly discouraged them from doing so especially given the deep history on this issue,” Marrone wrote. “However, as we have seen time and again on other issues, Eric failed to act.”

The disclosure of the email gives a rare, behind-the-scenes glimpse of the internal politics of a cutthroat sector in which multibillion-dollar companies ferociously compete in one bidding war while allying to win another. Executives often refer to rival companies as “competi-mates,” a play on the words competitor and teammate.

Late last month, Lockheed’s executives told AIA they were suspending its membership in the association. Taiclet, who became Lockheed’s CEO in June 2020, is no longer listed as an AIA board member on its website.

A Lockheed spokesperson did not respond to questions about the email, but confirmed that the company had suspended its AIA membership and that it had recently joined the National Association of Manufacturers.

“Lockheed Martin routinely evaluates our memberships in industry associations to most efficiently support our long-term objectives,” the spokesperson wrote. “Following an assessment, we have rejoined the National Association of Manufacturers and continue our work with the National Defense Industrial Association and Professional Services Council, but do not plan to continue our membership in the Aerospace Industries Association at this time.”

Don't miss:

Asked about Lockheed’s departure, an AIA spokesperson said: “Every company makes decisions about its industry relations and advocacy strategy. AIA understands that because we represent the full ecosystem of small, medium, and large companies.

“Bipartisanship, collaboration, and consensus are at the heart of what AIA does, and are essential to effectively advocating for the entire aerospace and defense industry,” the spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “We will continue to rely on this cooperative approach—as we have for more than 100 years—to speak with a unified voice in support of the priorities of our more than 320 members.”

Marrone, a former special assistant to Defense Secretary Robert Gates and later chief of staff to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, worked for AIA as vice president for national security and acquisition policy between 2013 and 2014. He and Fanning both served in the Obama administration's Pentagon. But more recently, Marrone has become Lockheed’s leading critic of Fanning’s AIA tenure.

In his email, Marrone argued that the CEOs who make up AIA’s executive committee “should never be placed in such a position” to explain why they are opposed. He wrote that Lockheed’s position—that the group should reject Airbus’ application—has not changed and that the matter should be addressed by an AIA panel made up of lower-level company executives.

“I put forward this arrangement not as an ask, but a demand,” Marrone wrote. “Eric’s failure here should not result in CEOs having to engage on a matter that has been asked and answered with great fanfare several times in the past.”

Marrone wrote that he had sent the message to “several of my colleagues” at other defense firms “to provide them the benefit of our Lockheed position.”

Over the past year, Lockheed executives have become increasingly frustrated with AIA’s focus on commercial aerospace issues over defense issues, according to a person familiar with the company’s position. That person played down the email, saying it was intended to express frustration with the handling of the application and not a reflection about the company’s opinion about Airbus.

Despite Lockheed’s opposition to Airbus’ joining AIA, not all U.S. firms feel that way. Last year, several of Airbus’ American-based suppliers urged the company to apply for AIA membership.

The European company spends tens of billions of dollars annually on U.S.-made parts for its planes, and that number is growing. Meanwhile, the biggest U.S. aerospace company, Boeing, was in crisis, with problems in both its military and civil business segments. With U.S. parts suppliers increasingly dependent on Airbus, they argued, the company should have a seat when executives get together to discuss issues facing the aerospace and defense sector, an industry source said.

Like Lockheed, Boeing had long opposed Airbus’ membership in AIA, according to numerous people familiar with the company’s position, but its most vocal opponent in Washington—former chief lobbyist Tim Keating—left the company in June. Airbus had planned to submit an application to join AIA in the fall, well before the association’s CEO-filled board met in early December, but instead submitted its application a few weeks later, just before Christmas, the industry source said.

AIA formally rejected Airbus’ application in late February, a company spokesperson said.

“As a matter of AIA policy, our association does not comment on the confidential discussions of our CEO-led Executive Committee,” the AIA spokesperson said. “This includes the status of any membership applications. Airbus is an Associate Member in good standing at AIA.”

Associate member CEOs cannot serve on the association's executive committee and therefore have less influence. In an email, the Airbus spokesperson said the company had been seeking more dialogue with AIA.

“With a 53-year history of operations in the U.S., more than 30 U.S. locations, four aircraft assembly lines with thousands of employees here, and $15 [billion] in parts purchased annually from U.S. suppliers, we felt an obligation to our supply chain, employees and the industry to drive meaningful dialog within AIA,” wrote James Darcy, an Airbus spokesperson. “Airbus has played a leading role in our industry’s recovery from the extreme adversity of the past several years, and we will continue to help shape the future of our industry on critical issues and policy decisions, regardless of membership status in this organization.”

In Mobile, site of February’s rally, Airbus builds commercial airliners for Delta Air Lines, JetBlue, and other carriers. This week company officials announced it would increase airplane production in Alabama and create 1,000 new jobs.

Yet Airbus is still widely viewed as a European firm that ferociously competes against Boeing for jetliner sales. For more than a decade, the companies were locked in a trade dispute: Boeing claimed that Airbus was receiving illegal government subsidies that allowed it to sell planes at cheaper prices. It battled Boeing twice in U.S. Air Force refueling tanker competitions. In 2008, the Air Force chose Airbus and its American partner Northrop Grumman to build 179 aircraft, but that deal was canceled after the Government Accountability Office found the Air Force didn’t properly evaluate the two bids. Three years later in a new contest, the Air Force chose the Boeing tanker over Airbus. Now 11 years later, the Boeing tanker still faces technical problems that prevent it from flying all of its intended missions.

Last year, the Air Force began a new effort to buy 160 more tankers. This time, Airbus partnered with Lockheed, the world’s largest defense firm, in its bid to oust Boeing. In March, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall put the prospects of a competition in doubt, telling reporters that the service might simply order more Boeing tankers.

Airbus would not be the first non-U.S. company admitted to the AIA, whose members include the UK-based BAE Systems and Brazil’s Embraer. Airbus is already a member of the U.S.-based National Defense Industrial Association, another trade group that represents a broader group of defense contractors. But AIA is considered a more exclusive and influential group, since its board is largely made up of the CEOs of the largest defense companies.

The industry source said Lockheed believed that admitting Airbus would further tilt AIA’s focus toward civil aviation and away from defense concerns. In 2020, the coronavirus pandemic turned the commercial aerospace sector on its head leading airlines to ground planes, cancel new orders, and layoff workers as passenger air travel declined in record numbers. The sector has also had to deal with 5G communications signals possibly interfering with aircraft navigation systems. All-the-while, the Pentagon’s budget has been steadily on the rise.

For Lockheed, AIA’s consideration of the Airbus application was on a growing list of frustrations with Fanning, a former Army secretary who held a number of high-level Pentagon posts during the Obama administration, according to industry sources. For instance, the company was frustrated by AIA’s handling of the Biden administration’s vaccine mandate for contractors. Some companies sought approval to require regular COVID tests instead of laying off noncompliant workers amid a tight labor market.

Then in January, the Biden administration sued to block Lockheed’s $4.4 billion acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne. Moments before kickoff on Super Bowl Sunday, Lockheed said it would abandon the deal.

The next day, the Biden administration released a 30-page report making a case against consolidation within the defense industry. The report was not well received in C-suites across the sector. For Lockheed, the report was the final straw. Politico first reported Lockheed’s frustration with Fanning over the vaccine mandates and consolidation report.

Marrone, in his email, called the Pentagon report “an existential threat” to the defense industry. He criticized AIA’s response while complementing the responses by the Professional Services Council and NDIA, two other trade organizations that represent a broader group of defense and federal contractors.

“As a result, Lockheed will continue to withhold our dues and refrain from sponsorship opportunities for 2022 until we see meaningful and significant change occur,” Marrone wrote.

Lockheed leaving the organization could do exactly what Marrone feared: push the association to focus more on commercial sales than on defense, the industry source said. And that would benefit Lockheed’s rival: Boeing."

The aerospace company announced on Wednesday that it is working with several other partners to launch an Air Mobility Initiative (AIM), focused on exploring how eVTOL operations could be implemented in Germany, including what would be required to support unmanned traffic management (UTM) services and ground infrastructure.

“In many parts of the world, eVTOLs will offer a whole new mobility service in the near future,” said Markus May, head of operations for urban air mobility at Airbus, in a press release. “Airbus and the AMI partners are aware that the introduction of such a system requires the cooperation of many players with different competences. Our goal is to build a transport service that benefits society and this is what we are setting up here in Bavaria.”

Along with Airbus, some of the other AIM partners include the City of Ingolstadt, railway company Deutsche Bahn, air traffic control company Deutsche Flugsicherung, UTM consultant Droniq, Diehl Aerospace, and Munich Airport.

The partners have secured €86 million (US$91 million) in private and public investments that will be used over three years. This includes €17 million (US$18 million) from the state of Bavaria, and €24 million (US$25 million) from the German federal government.

According to Airbus, the partners will start by looking at the technological, infrastructural, legal, and social requirements needed to implement UAM in Germany, and will later use that knowledge in a demonstration project under real conditions with eVTOL aircraft.

Airbus, which is developing the CityAirbus NextGen eVTOL aircraft, will be leading the eVTOL research activities with Diehl Aerospace, the University of Stuttgart and other partners.

The aerospace company will also work with Droniq, f.u.n.k.e. Avionics, SkyFive, BrigkAir, DFS, and Telekom, as well as universities from Munich and Hamburg to explore UTM requirements.

Meanwhile, Munich Airport, Deutsche Bahn, Bauhaus Luftfahrt, Airport Nürnberg, and the universities of Ingolstadt and Munich will conduct research on vertiports and city integration.

This new initiative in Germany comes after Airbus announced last week that it was looking to introduce its CityAirbus NextGen eVTOL aircraft in Italy through a partnership with ITA Airways."

DALLAS – On March 25, Airbus launched its latest Zero Emission Development Center (ZDEC) for hydrogen technologies, based in Felton, UK.

The facility’s main goal will be the research and development of a cost-competitive cryogenic fuel system. Airbus considers this system crucial for the successful entry-into-service of Airbus’ ZEROe passenger aircraft by 2035.

The UK ZDEC will complement similar complexes already operating across Europe: in Spain (Madrid), France (Nantes), and Germany (Stade for composite structure technologies and Bremen for metallic structural technologies). Airbus states that all ZEDCs are expected to be fully operational and ready for ground testing in 2023, with flight testing starting in 2026.

The latest expansion of Airbus’ hydrogen testing capabilities remarks the commitment of the European manufacturer to make the aviation industry greener. Commitment highlighted by the CEO Guillaume Faury, who in an interview with CNBC earlier this year stressed,” [aviation would] potentially face significant hurdles if we don’t manage to decarbonize at the right pace.”

Airbus Investing Smart in the UK

The launch of the UK ZEDC highlights the willingness of the European planemaker to invest in research facilities in the UK. Indeed, it follows the opening of the $50m (£40m) AIRTeC research and testing facility in Filton in June 2021. The facility was funded by the ATI and Airbus, to deliver the next generation of aircraft wings, landing-gear systems, and fuel system designs.

Both the ZDEC and AIRTec will benefit from the recent commitment by the UK Government to guarantee $863m (£685m) funding to the Aerospace Technology Institute (ATI) over the next three years to support the development of zero-carbon and ultra-low-emission aircraft technologies. This envisions the goal of the government to support green jobs and meet its ambitious net-zero targets.

Sabine Klauke, Airbus Chief Technical Officer, commented, “Establishing the ZEDC in the UK expands Airbus’ in-house industrial capabilities to design, develop, test, and manufacture cryogenic hydrogen storage tanks and related systems for the ZEROe project across Airbus’ four home countries. This, coupled with our partnership with ATI, will allow us to leverage our respective expertise to realize the potential of hydrogen technology to support the decarbonization of the aviation industry.”

DALLAS – A British judge today issued orders for a speedy trial in the row between Airbus and Qatar Airways (QR).

The airline and the manufacturer have been fighting in a public and bitter dispute over defective paintwork that the airline says endangers its planes by exposing the copper lightning protection mesh.

The two parties have been fighting in the British High Court over the peeling paint on 23 QR A350s, which were grounded by regulators in Qatar.

In a rare public comment on the case, QR’s CEO, Akbar Al Baker, told reporters on the sidelines of a news conference, “Every partnership has disputes, and I just hope that this dispute can be resolved outside the courts of law.”

However, in light of today’s ruling, it looks like Al Baker’s wish will go unfulfilled.

A Trial in a Year’s Time

“I am in absolutely no doubt that this case should be tried as soon as is practically possible,” Judge David Waksman said. “The costs for both sides are way over the top in my judgment. There is far too much time that is being spent here.”

The British High Court ruled against the airline, which had asked the court to split the case into two parts: 1) to order Airbus to conduct a deep analysis into the issues causing the paint to peel, and 2) to prevent Airbus from delivering more A350s to the airline.

If planes were delivered, it would trigger payment clauses. If QR rejected those delivered planes, Airbus would be free to offer them to other airlines.

Reuters reports that the judge gave an indicative window from June of next year for the trial to begin.

Qatar is now seeking around US$1bn in compensation from Airbus. The plane maker has acknowledged the problem but says that it has fully reviewed and solved the quality issues and that safety is not compromised. The European Aviation Safety Agency has said the planes are airworthy.

Other airlines have continued to fly the A350 without problem. Some have seen a similar problem in paint deterioration, but none have grounded the type due to the issue.

Qatar has 21 A350s on order, some of which are ready to be delivered. The airline already has 34 A350-900s and 19 A350-1000s in its fleet, although some are grounded.

A Timeline

In November 2020, Qatar flew an A350 to Shannon, Ireland, to be repainted in a World Cup livery. The plane was subsequently flown to Toulouse, France where reports of “irregularities on the surface coating” emerged.

In February 2021, Lufthansa flew three of its oldest A350s to Airbus for repainting. This raised industry eyebrows as Lufthansa has the capability to repaint in-house. This work was conducted under warranty by Airbus.

In late May 2021, QR threatened to halt deliveries of A350s due to a manufacturing issue. In June, it confirmed that it was indeed no longer accepting the aircraft and that the problem was due to the condition of the surface under the paintwork. In August, the Qatar Civil Aviation Authority grounded 13 of the type. Shortly thereafter, the EASA said that it was not “intending to take any action as the State of Design for this issue at this time. No other airlines have reported paint and protection damage.”

In November, due to a lack of capacity due to the groundings, Qatar “reluctantly” brought back to service around half of its A380 fleet.

Late in November 2021, a report by Reuters said that other airlines were reporting similar problems with the surface deterioration. Finnair (F9), Cathay Pacific (CX), Etihad (EY), and Air Caraibes (TX) saw “cosmetic damage” to the craft. None, however, were grounding their planes.

In December, with Airbus holding firm to its view of the plane’s safety while Qatar and local regulators said otherwise, the airline revealed that it was seeking independent legal counsel on the issue. In reply, Airbus said, “The attempt by this customer to misrepresent this specific topic as an airworthiness issue represents a threat to the international protocols on safety matters.”

Four days before Christmas, Qatar filed legal proceedings against Airbus at the Technology and Construction division of the High Court in London. The airline was seeking US$618m in damages, plus US$4 million for each day that one of its A350s was grounded due to the issue.

Two weeks later, Airbus cancelled Qatar’s order for 50 A321 neo planes. The manufacturer said it was within its legal rights to do so, citing contract clauses that linked the two agreements.

To push its point to the public, on January 21, Qatar released the first video that showed the damage that its A350s had experienced. Ten days later, Qatar teamed up with Boeing to purchase up to 100 planes, 50 777X Freighters and 50 737MAX planes to replace the A321s.

In early February, Reuters noted that Airbus had cancelled two of Qatar’s A350 orders. In mid-month, a British judge said that Airbus had to stop “any practical impact” of its cancelling the A321 order and not offer them to other airlines – pending court hearings in April.

Late in the month, Airbus asked for US$220m in damages for two A350s saying that Qatar and Qatari regulators “wrongfully colluded or conspired and/or otherwise acted together in bad faith in relation to the groundings.” A month later, the airline disputed the claim saying that it had not violated its contract with Airbus and that the manufacturer had not detailed how it had arrived at that amount.

On March 30, court documents cite a safety assessment by the EAS saying that paint deterioration over the fuel tanks could expose the copper mesh and lead to, in a worst-case scenario, a fire.

A week later, Airbus canceled a third A350 order. On April 26, a judge said that Airbus was within its rights to cancel the A321neo order and that it could offer the slots to other manufacturers. However, Qatar can challenge this ruling if and when the entire issue comes to full trial.

Opinion: What Could Have Been For the Airbus A380 - Aviation Week,"Mon, 09 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9tcm8vYWlyY3JhZnQtcHJvcHVsc2lvbi9vcGluaW9uLXdoYXQtY291bGQtaGF2ZS1iZWVuLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzgw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Airbus A380 production line has closed, with the last of only 251 aircraft built delivered to Emirates in December. Now is a good time to look back on why the A380, though a favorite with passengers, was not successful commercially.

Explanations start in the cabin, where 10-abreast seating on the main deck was far too generous when compared to 10-abreast on a Boeing 777 or nine-abreast on a 787, the density standards to which almost all airlines have moved. While customers liked the extra room, they would not pay for it. No airline would push seating to 11 abreast, which is awkward, requiring a 3-5-3 layout.

A second feature that customers liked but that made the A380 less economically viable was the low noise level. Pushed by Singapore Airlines, Airbus designed the A380 to address that issue back when noise concerns around London Heathrow Airport were the driving environmental requirement rather than the carbon footprint. The result was that the Engine Alliance GP7200 and Rolls-Royce Trent 900 have a wider fan, and the aircraft has bigger, heavier nacelles than are optimal for fuel burn. If the A380 had been designed to minimize fuel burn, it would have been 0.5% more efficient.

The A380 also missed some key technologies and will be the last all-metal aircraft ever built. Carbon fiber is clearly superior, at least for the wings, though it is perhaps less critical for the fuselage. The metal made the aircraft heavier than it should have been, a problem compounded by carrying excess weight in preparation for a stretched version. The design and production delays, followed by slow deliveries, rendered the overall technology of the aircraft—particularly the engines—obsolete too soon. The slow sales did not encourage either engine manufacturer to invest in upgrades, a problem exacerbated by Airbus’ unnecessary and costly decision to provide a choice of engines.

The issues described here are not entirely market factors. The A380’s main problem was its inability to offer key features driving market demand.

Emirates was the only carrier that preferred the A380 over other options to the extent that it placed repeat orders, an acid test of a commercial airplane’s attractiveness. The aircraft works for Emirates because its average stage length for the A380 is low. Although used for some very long routes such as Dubai-Los Angeles, the more typical mission is 6-7 hr., to Europe or Asia. Emirates also often uses the A380 on even shorter routes, of a few hours, to the Indian subcontinent and within the Middle East. The A380 can compete on efficiency on dense routes of 7 hr., but not on routes of 10-12 hr., where the big twins are far more efficient.

Three changes would have been essential for the A380 to have been more viable commercially. First, it needed a stretch, perhaps of only 50 seats. Since adding seats would not have changed trip operating costs very much, the cost per seat would have decreased significantly. Second, to fill these seats with lower frequencies, operators would have needed to focus on leisure travel routes rather than business travelers. Finally, the aircraft needed technology upgrades or at least upgraded engines, the same recipe that has successfully been applied to the Boeing 737 and 777 and the Airbus A320 and A330.

When first launched, the Boeing 747-100 was not a big seller, but the stretched, reengined 747-200 was. With some different decisions and further investment, the A380 might have achieved similar success, at least in an environment not distorted by the disruptions of COVID-19.

A varied fleet of aircraft — from regionals to widebodies — leading into the pandemic is emerging as a more homogeneous, and imbalanced fleet of narrowbodies. Yet, even with the production of the single-aisle still remaining far below 2019 levels, it is the narrowbody that finds itself in top demand – with available supply dwindling.

IFR Flying: Mooney vs. Airbus - Plane & Pilot,"Wed, 25 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBsYW5lYW5kcGlsb3RtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvcGlsb3QtdGFsay9pZnItZmx5aW5nLW1vb25leS12cy1haXJidXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It’s time for a confession, friends. In the time between earning my instrument rating and getting hired at an airline, I never flew IFR in a single-engine aircraft. I air-filed for an approach into Lakeland, Florida, during my multi-engine commercial check ride, and then I was off to more capable aircraft.

More than a decade later, we bought the Mooney, and I flew it VFR mostly for two years, except for one IFR cross-country. Despite having very carefully filed our flight plan with the correct equipment codes and along designated airways, I kept getting cleared direct to all sorts of places. “I’ll take a heading for now and direct when able,” I had to keep replying. I got the hint. It was time for an upgrade.

After installing a Garmin GPS 175, a G5 attitude indicator and a JPI engine monitor, I felt more capable, but I still flew VFR to get comfortable with things before diving into the deep end of general aviation IFR. Finally, as departure day neared for a trip out west to check off a few more national parks from our list, I frowned at the weather forecast. We’d planned to depart the day after Thanksgiving and spend all day flying to Carlsbad, New Mexico, the first leg of a trip that would loop through Texas and New Mexico to add Carlsbad Caverns, Guadalupe Mountain and Big Bend to our list of national parks visited. As the weather forecast started showing rain on Black Friday, the day our trip was to begin, I groused about having to reposition the Mooney to a paved runway for our launch. Then Amy had an idea: Why not load up and depart immediately after the family’s Thanksgiving feast? “The Mooney can fly at night, right?” she asked.

“Sure, it can fly in the dark,” I replied. And we did. As it turned out, we’d have to deal with clouds and rain, in addition to the dark. A weak band of weather crossed our path, starting at Houston with some strong showers and thunderstorms and dissipating northward across our route, before strengthening again well to the north. Our route through the weakest part of the front showed almost no rain, but I knew it’d be there. I picked up our clearance airborne from West Georgia as we angled toward Birmingham, then turned down toward Meridian, Mississippi, where the weather began. “Probably gonna be a little bumpy,” I warned Amy, but the caution was overblown. With no convective activity at all, the clouds just gave a gentle nudge now and then, as smooth of a ride as one could ask for. I flipped the intercom to isolate Amy from the radios so she could enjoy her audiobooks and podcasts, and when I next looked over, she was sound asleep with a pillow wedged between the seatback and the doorframe.

Traffic was light, and by light, I mean that often we were the only airplane on a given controller’s scope. Headwinds had me covering ground at Skyhawk speeds. An approach controller in Monroe, Louisiana, and I had a great conversation comparing the weather tools we each had available. As we chatted, I kept gazing out my side window. We were solidly in the soup, and the nav lights had redecorated the light gray surroundings into red and green orbs around the airplane. I’d lost sight of the ground for some time. Amy was sound asleep, and my only link to another was the talkative controller. As I took the handoff to the next controller, I meant it when I said, “Happy Thanksgiving, for the next few hours,” in parting.

After a fuel stop in Minden, Louisiana, we continued west, and the controllers in Dallas sent us winging straight through the mostly unused class B airspace, and I had to thank them for the “best Thanksgiving shortcut ever” as we clipped across the metroplex, landing in Eastland, Texas, where airport manager Bode Zeitz helped me push the Mooney into a hangar for the night. I grimaced: Beneath the hangar lights, our freshly repainted, resealed, and balanced propeller had a shiny leading edge of bare metal—I’d completely forgotten that a couple hours of flying in the rain will do that to ones’ blades.

Worn paint on the prop blades was an annoyance, and just one of several things that reminded me that if flying IFR in the Mooney were to become a regular thing, I’d have to mind the differences from my day job.

When you’re streaking across the continent at a significant portion of the speed of sound, the interactions with controllers are brief. Check in with a hello and, a few minutes later, a quick goodbye as you exit that controller’s area of concern. Add in a controller pilot data link communications for the handoff to the next frequency, and technology steals your goodbyes.

But at 140 knots, there’s time to get comfortable, listen to the conversations, and establish some sort of relationship, even if it is as imagined and one-sided as that relationship we all had in grade school with someone who didn’t even know we existed.

Unlike the Airbus, though, I could look down and see the ground in detail. I tried to keep a landing spot in sight, but there were times when we’d be hard-pressed to come to a stop without hitting a rock, tree or ditch big enough to ruin the day. I looked down on oilfields, natural gas wells and windmills to observe them in greater detail than in the jet—when you’re below 10,000 feet in a jet, you’re laser-focused on the arrival and approach ahead. With apologies to the cast of the movie Airplane!, it’s a completely different kind of flying.

My gazes out the window were interrupted as I scanned back inside, though, for the needles weren’t as enthralled with the exotic terrain below. Despite the Positive Control wing leveler working just fine, the nose still meandered a little left and right, though it was easily tended with a nudge on the yoke. The fuel selector needed an occasional flip to keep things balanced. When the altitude drifted, the weight of my feet and their Ariat boots were often enough to arrest a sink or climb by moving one foot or both a little forward or aft.

The whole time, I contemplated IFR in a piston single versus at my airline. Airline flying can make a pilot lazy right quick—dispatchers fire over a release package that includes your flight plan, a navigation log that covers the route waypoint by waypoint, weather observations and forecasts and a NOTAM package that usually burns up a dozen pages to tell you that a taxiway sign is unlit or circling minimums on an approach are higher than published—but still well below the company minimums. Our company’s computers generate solutions for weight and balance and performance calculations. We scan the NOTAMS, glance at the route to make sure dispatch hasn’t filed us directly down a line of thunderstorms (it happens more than you would think), and off we go.

Meanwhile, roaming the country in an old airplane that has outlived several of its prior owners, weight and balance are pretty precise, although the performance calculations are aviation’s version of Kentucky windage—CAR3-certified airplanes come with manuals that are more of a sales pamphlet than a pilot operating handbook. I’m responsible for rounding up the weather and NOTAMS, although EFB apps have made that a lot easier. I choose a route that may or may not be rejected by the system—but so far, all the amendments to my planned routes have been reasonable, if not outright shortcuts.

On the last day of our vacation, a significant rain shower sat right on the north side of our destination airport. I’d departed VFR, picked up flight following and, as we neared, I watched the rain grow while remaining firmly planted just north of the airport. We took a swing south for weather and to join the RNAV 35 approach at West Georgia. I’m sure the controller was shaking their head with the wind out of the south and my request for the approach that would have had a significant tailwind, but the ceilings were high enough for me to cancel IFR once we broke out below the overcast and joined the pattern for runway 17, keeping the pattern tight between the runway and the weather north of the field.

I dropped Amy off—that’s where her car was parked—and then flew the last few miles to the airstrip where our Mooney sleeps.

After roaming the country in varying weather conditions and areas I’d never seen before, I left the GPS unprogrammed; my phone and tablet on the backseat. I didn’t bother with looking at much on the panel other than the engine gauges as I scooted the last minutes of a spectacular journey. After I cleared a gaggle of vultures off the runway, the tires rolled onto the grass and clover they’d been missing during their adventure of asphalt, concrete and gravel.

As I pushed our gray bird back into her roost, my eyes fell to the black streaks of oxidation we’d picked up by flying through the rain. I remembered seeing similar streaks on working planes as a kid. The Gray Gal wasn’t a working bird, but she’d worked well for us. I jotted down my squawk list, threw the last of the bags in the car, yawned and headed home. For all the differences I’d noted in my return to little airplane IFR, the exhaustion after a long day’s flying is universal.

Chief executive Guillaume Faury disclosed during a first-quarter briefing that the airframer aimed to reach the output level in 2025.

The company had already been moving to raise the monthly production rate to 65 aircraft by summer next year, to carve into the backlog of A320-family jets which – at the end of March – stood at 5,741.

Faury had previously pointed to a decision on increasing single-aisle production rates by mid-year but states that this has been “accelerated”.

“We had indicators telling us it was the right moment [and] conditions for launching a rate increase,” he says.

Airbus has long stated that the demand for the aircraft is strong, but that it has had to verify the preparedness of the supply chain.

Faury says that the airframer has assessed a large number of suppliers. “We got feedback that tells us [the rate increase] is possible,” he states.

“We see that from rate 65, that we intend to reach in the middle of next year, and 2025 this gives enough time to have a speed of ramp-up that’s consistent with what the supply chain will be able to deliver.”

Airbus will introduce the ramp-up “progressively”, he says, but adds that giving precise monthly delivery figures for 2024-25 would be “premature”.

He points out that a “lot of challenges” remain in the short term – including the continuing recovery from the pandemic – which bring complexity to the supply chain, and indicates that, while there are no significant departures in quality, the ability of suppliers to deliver on time is “changing tremendously”.

Faury says that early detection of supply-chain issues, enabling prompt action to be taken, will be essential to managing the ramp-up.

Airbus will meet the higher production rates by increasing capacity at its industrial facilities and “growing the industrial footprint” at its US plant in Mobile. Its preparations include ensuring that all the final assembly lines are capable of producing the A321neo.

“We see continuing strong growth in commercial aircraft demand [beyond this year] driven by the A320 family,” says Faury. “This ramp-up will benefit the aerospace industry’s global value chain.”"
Airbus Pursues Rate Increases As Supplier Concerns Persist - Aviation Week,"Thu, 12 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9hZXJvc3BhY2UvbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy1zdXBwbHktY2hhaW4vYWlyYnVzLXB1cnN1ZXMtcmF0ZS1pbmNyZWFzZXMtc3VwcGxpZXItY29uY2VybnMtcGVyc2lzdNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is slowly firming up its plans to raise A320neo-family production to 75 aircraft per month. The move was planned for more than a year and was not unexpected, and customer demand may justify it. But the step-up is still being met with skepticism about the supply chain’s ability to cope with it.

Slow Boeing production ramp-up opens market opportunities for its European rival

To raise rates, Airbus might need to prefinance suppliers

Certification issues are delaying A321XLR service entry

“Following an analysis of global customer demand as well as an assessment of the industrial ecosystem’s readiness, [Airbus] is now working with its suppliers and partners to enable monthly production rates of 75 in 2025,” Airbus said May 4. The announcement notably stopped short of definitely saying that production levels will move up that high. The caution is a reflection of supply chain realities set against a lack of competitive pressure from Boeing. Whatever level Airbus ultimately achieves, it will be far higher than the output its rival will be able to deliver.

The European OEM had already committed to reaching 65 aircraft per month in the summer of 2023. Now it aims to increase that by another 10 aircraft per month within about two years, roughly 14% more. The work for the additional 10 aircraft will be spread across all of its sites, but its Mobile, Alabama, facility will be expanded to include a second A320neo-family final assembly line. All sites will be made capable of building A321neos, and that aircraft’s production share is expected to continue to rise.

According to the plans, Airbus will be building 89 narrowbody aircraft per month starting in 2025, if the A220 is included. Airbus has previously said that it plans to boost A220 output to 14 per month, from six, within the next three years. If the plans are implemented, Airbus would be producing almost three times as many single-aisle aircraft as Boeing, unless its U.S. rival is also able to increase production. Boeing President and CEO David Calhoun said April 27 that the company has no plans for the time being to go beyond rate 31, given constraints it has discovered in its own supply chain. Airbus may already be building twice as many narrowbodies as Boeing by the end of 2023.

Such a large gap in production volumes over time would lead to further significant shifts in the OEMs’ single-aisle market share. And recent industry trends show single-aisles taking an even larger part of the overall market, given the weakness of the widebody segment and the retrenching of some regional jets.

“We see continuing strong growth in commercial aircraft demand driven by the A320 family,” says Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury. Airbus has shared its plans with engine manufacturers and is “confident in the supply chain being able to manage” the ramp-up, he says.

Many others in the industry are not as optimistic. “Everyone is concerned about the supply chain,” says Agency Partners analyst Sash Tusa. “The weakest part of the chain is what pulls you down.” He points out that Airbus’ carefully chosen wording gives it “a lot of wiggle room” and a way to back off if the ramp-up plans cannot be achieved to the full extent.

Consultant Nico Buchholz of Flightlevel500, formerly head of procurement at Bombardier and of fleet planning for Lufthansa, goes further. “The supply chain is not capable of handling [rate 75],” he says. “Many are still in dire economic straits.” Tier 1 suppliers will be able to handle the production increase, he contends, but he sees major weaknesses and risks among Tier 2 and 3 companies. Airbus may have to provide major prefinancing for some to kick-start growth, he predicts. “That’s OK if it is only one or two companies. But it’s a different story if many more request help,” he notes.

Buchholz says that even rate 65 will be challenging, and rate 75 will only be possible over a longer stretch of time. That may not necessarily be bad for Airbus, since the usual escalation clauses ensure that prices can be raised for delivery delays requested by customers at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Michael Santo of aerospace consultancy H&Z notes that suppliers in general have gained more faith in Airbus’ forecasts in recent months. An H&Z survey taken last year found that 41% of Airbus suppliers were second-guessing the OEM’s forecasts and preferred to make their own assumptions. In that same survey, 45% of respondents described the planned Airbus rate increases as “unrealistic.”

The mood has since shifted, in part because Airbus has been willing in some cases to commit earlier to purchase orders. Suppliers benefiting from those deals have been able to reassure their own suppliers further down the chain.

Despite all the factors affecting its partners, Airbus is still pushing for cost reductions of around 10% per unit in return for the higher guaranteed volumes. Santo says the pricing negotiations are “very aggressive” but stop short of putting some of the weaker players at serious financial risk. Further pricing concessions are particularly difficult for suppliers in the industry that depend on steady widebody production, which has taken a much more serious hit than narrowbodies. Balancing steeper discounts on narrowbody contracts with more profitable widebody assignments no longer works.

The demand side of the equation appears to be the easier part. Airbus’ combined A220/A320neo single-aisle backlog is 6,388 units (see chart). In addition to the return of general demand, other factors support the view that the production of more new aircraft is desirable. Airlines are under such intense political pressure to demonstrate a strong commitment to reducing their carbon footprint that orders for new-generation aircraft are seen as smart, even if it means prematurely retiring older aircraft. The high price of jet fuel is increasing the competitive advantage of more fuel-efficient aircraft. That is particularly important where pricing is weakened by low-cost carrier competition.

Boeing will not be able to do much to help meet demand for new aircraft, as it is staying at rate 31 for the 737 MAX, at least in the short term. So some customers have nowhere to go but Airbus for additional lift. For some time, Airbus appeared hesitant to push too hard for bigger market share because it was not in its interest to force Boeing to launch a new program. That strategy is likely being reconsidered, though, as few in the industry expect Boeing to be able to move ahead with a new aircraft in the short term. “There is a difference between driving the opposition into a corner and taking advantage of very bad decisions and filling space that has been vacated,” Tusa says.

Airbus has other concerns besides supplier capacity for the A320neo family. The company had to delay entry into service of the A321XLR by about one fiscal quarter, to early 2024 from the end of 2023. Faury did not confirm the exact reasons for the delay, other than to say that the certification process “takes a bit more time than we had assumed.” Airbus is “refining the design in the certification process,” he adds.

The issues are related to the rear-center fuel tank (RCT) that will be added to the A321XLR as a fixed feature that is also part of the aircraft’s structure. Airbus plans to install insulation between the tank and the passenger cabin to avoid a “cold-feet effect” but has told the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in the ongoing certification process that there is no space for fire protection that is fully compliant with current standards between the tank and the passenger cabin.

In addition, EASA’s special condition consultation paper states: “In order to protect the cabin occupants from an external pool fire, the lower half of the fuselage in the longitudinal location of the rear centre tank shall be resistant to fire penetration.” The special condition consultation process is open for comments until May 23. The RCT is a structural part of both the center and aft fuselage sections, which are joined around it.

“The certification of the A321XLR is an ongoing project,” EASA says. “The complete set of conditions in relation with the installation of the rear centre tanks is still under definition.”

Faury says there will be “no material impact” on the aircraft’s specifications or range, even if there are design changes. Airbus advertizes the aircraft at a range of 4,700 nm. Industry sources say a local strengthening of the lower fuselage is being discussed, an element that neither Airbus nor EASA is confirming.

According to the Aviation Week Network Commercial Fleet Discovery database, Airbus has 526 firm orders for the aircraft."
The Airbus Copernicus CRISTAL Mission Satellite Built For The ESA Successfully Passes The PDR – SatNews - news.satnews.com,"Tue, 24 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL25ld3Muc2F0bmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wNS8yNC90aGUtYWlyYnVzLWNvcGVybmljdXMtY3Jpc3RhbC1taXNzaW9uLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS1idWlsdC1mb3ItdGhlLWVzYS1zdWNjZXNzZnVsbHktcGFzc2VzLXRoZS1wZHIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Copernicus Polar Ice and Snow Topography Altimetry mission CRISTAL is clearly on track. Following an intensive review process, the European Space Agency (ESA) has confirmed that the preliminary design of the satellite meets all system requirements.

CRISTAL will carry an advanced, multi-frequency altimeter that will measure sea ice thickness and ice sheet elevations – key climate change indicators. The CRISTAL altimeter will, for the first time, measure snow coverage of the ice sheets which will improve data quality significantly compared to its predecessor, CryoSat-2. These data will support maritime operations in polar oceans and contribute to a better understanding of climate processes.

Artistic rendition of ESA’s CryoSat-2 on-orbit.

The Preliminary Design Review (PDR) was organized using a new, more collaborative format. As a first step, an extensive review by more than 60 ESA engineers of a comprehensive data package, established by more than 100 engineers led by Airbus, took place over four weeks. In a second step, the major findings were intensively discussed in an interactive way between senior level experts, both on ESA and Industry side, up to the successful completion of the review.

CRISTAL will also support applications related to coastal and inland waters and the observation of ocean topography. The mission will ensure the long-term continuation of radar altimetry ice elevation and topographic change records, following on from previous missions such as ESA’s Earth Explorer CryoSat, also developed by Airbus and working flawlessly for 12 years, well beyond its design lifetime. Monitoring the cryosphere is essential to fully assess, predict and adapt to climate variability and change.

The 1.7 ton spacecraft is based on a proven, robust, Airbus satellite design building on the heritage from Sentinel-6 and CryoSat. Six fixed and two deployable solar arrays – 18.6 m² in total – ensure enough power on CRISTAL´s drifting polar orbit at 699 km. above the Earth. The satellite’s on-board memory will be able to store as much as 4 terabits of science data at once, providing scientists with a wealth of information during its 7.5 year lifetime.

The Airbus Defence and Space site in Friedrichshafen (Germany) is heading an industrial consortium involving companies from 19 countries to deliver the project, including Thales Alenia Space, to provide the IRIS Interferometric Radar Altimeter. Following the successful PDR, the CRISTAL project is now on track for the Critical Design Review (CDR), scheduled for May of 2024. The satellite platform and instrument will then be integrated and tested in the new, highly digitized, integration center at Airbus in Friedrichshafen. CRISTAL is currently scheduled for launch from the European spaceport in Kourou in 2027.

The Copernicus Sentinels are a fleet of dedicated EU-owned satellites, designed to deliver the wealth of data and imagery that are central to the European Union’s Copernicus environmental programme. The European Commission leads and coordinates this programme, to improve the management of the environment, safeguarding lives every day. The European Space Agency (ESA) is in charge of the space component, responsible for developing the family of Copernicus Sentinel satellites on behalf of the European Union and ensuring the flow of data for the Copernicus services, while the operations of the Copernicus Sentinels have been entrusted to ESA and EUMETSAT, the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites. Six new missions were selected in 2020 to join the fleet of Copernicus Sentinels and expand the current capabilities. Airbus is a key industrial contributor by developing and manufacturing satellites, instruments and components as well as providing related services."
Both Pilots Flew the Airbus A330 Asleep - Airways Magazine,"Mon, 30 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vYWlyd2F5c21hZy5jb20vcGlsb3RzLWZsZXctYTMzMC1hc2xlZXAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Both Pilots Flew the Airbus A330 Asleep

DALLAS – Yes, both pilots aboard ITA Airways’ (AZ) flight from New York to Rome were asleep at the same time and failed to maintain communication with air traffic control for about 10 minutes.

This particular incident took place on the first of May. AZ609 was a scheduled afternoon service between New York’s JFK and Rome (FCO) that was operated by an Airbus A330-200 under registration EI-EJP.

The departure was just like any other, but things went quiet in the cockpit towards the end of the flight, as media reports indicated that both the first officer and captain were asleep for a brief period and did not respond to nor communicate with air traffic control.

They were somewhere over France at FL380 and in contact with Marseille control, a rather busy center, especially in the summer months. Not to forget, the Airbus was at cruise altitude and on autopilot while the incident took place.

The first officer was actually approved to sleep, or what’s known as “controlled rest”—a brief period in which a crew member can take a nap under certain conditions. But, the captain was surely not approved to follow.

Luckily it was short-lived, communications were re-established just before the french authorities were all set to dispatch a couple of fighter jets to intercept the A330 and figure out what was happening in the cockpit. The jet landed safely in Rome.

Italian media reports that the captain was dismissed from his service after that flight for breaching safety. The pilot, however, denied his nap allegation and stated that there was an issue with the radio communication system failure and thus he couldn’t reply.

DALLAS – The first of Jetstar’s (JQ) 38 Airbus NEO aircraft is scheduled to arrive in Melbourne in the coming months as it prepares to enter a new era of flying.

The A321LR aircraft is set to take to the skies on some of the Australian LCC’s most popular domestic routes, including Melbourne to Cairns.

The new livery, which features a distinctive orange tail and underbelly, as well as newly branded wingtips, employs a two-coat ‘basecoat-clearcoat’ system that is long-lasting and reduces paint weight by up to 30%, resulting in a fuel savings of up to 108 tonnes per year and nearly 350 tonnes of CO2 emissions across the entire A321LR fleet.

The A321LRs have a number of features that will improve the customer experience, in addition to being 15% more fuel-efficient:

Seats are wider than those on the previous Jetstar A320/21 aircraft.

40 percent greater storage capacity in extra-large overhead bins

Engines that are up to 50% quieter

In-seat USB power and flip-down smartphone and tablet cradles

Eight more A321LRs will be delivered between August 2022 and May 2023, bringing the total number of A321LRs delivered to 18 by mid-2024.

Between 2024 and 2029, another 20 A321XLR aircraft will arrive, extending the range of narrowbody flights even more.

The Next-Gen Airbus A321

The Airbus A321LR is the next version of the A321 twin-engine jet, which is already a global success. The ‘neo’ stands for ‘new engine option,’ alluding to the aircraft’s quieter, more fuel-efficient CFM LEAP engines, which lower fuel usage by at least 15% while reducing aircraft noise by 50%.

40% additional storage space is provided by extra-large overhead bins. The A321LR will also have a longer range than the present A320/321 fleet, with a range of 1,200 kilometers.

Jetstar will initially use the A321LR on domestic routes such as Melbourne to Cairns and Gold Coast. As our foreign operation grows, the airline will consider flying international routes.

Comments from JetStar CEO

Jetstar Group CEO Gareth Evans said the arrival of the NEO fleet was one of the most significant milestones in the airline’s 18-year history.

“These modern aircraft are world-class in terms of performance, comfort, and sustainability, ensuring our customers will enjoy a new range of benefits on board.

“With the NEOs arriving in our 18th birthday year, their arrival symbolises how we’ve grown to become the largest and most successful low-cost carrier in the Asia Pacific region.

Evans added, “In addition to flying on our most popular domestic routes, the long-range NEOs open up new international opportunities, providing us with an opportunity to expand our international network and deliver on our promise to offer more low fares to more destinations.”

The Australian low-cost airline is headquartered in Melbourne and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Qantas (QF), created in response to the threat posed by airline Virgin Blue.

"First look: Inside Delta's newest jet, the Airbus A321neo - The Points Guy","Wed, 18 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2RlbHRhLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIxbmVvLWZpcnN0LWxvb2stdG91ci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Delta Air Lines is upgrading the domestic travel experience with its newest jet, the Airbus A321neo.

In March, the Atlanta-based carrier received its first A321neo, or ""new engine option,"" from the Airbus production facility in Hamburg, Germany, and the jet, registered N501DA, has since been undergoing entry-to-service work at the airline's Atlanta hub.

Now, the airline is finally ready to put the A321neo on commercial flights; the inaugural is scheduled for Friday, May 20, at 8:29 a.m. local time from Boston Logan International Airport (BOS) to San Francisco International Airport (SFO).

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

While the first A321neos will be based at the airline's Boston hub (serving select transcontinental routes), you'll soon see these planes at many more airports across the country. That's because Delta has 155 A321neos on order, after increasing its order with the European plane-maker twice last year.

While the A321neo might look like a standard domestic jet on the outside, it's loaded with enhancements on the inside, including a brand-new first-class product with extra privacy, the airline's fastest Wi-Fi connection and power outlets throughout.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

In anticipation of the first revenue flight, TPG got a first look on board the Delta A321neo. Here's what you can expect to find inside Delta's latest jet.

20 new first-class recliners

Perhaps the biggest change is in the pointy end of the plane. The A321neo is the first jet to feature Delta's snazzy new domestic first-class recliners.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

For years, the forward cabin on single-aisle planes crisscrossing the country has largely looked the same. Domestic first class is usually outfitted with recliners in a 2-2 configuration, with more space, increased pitch and larger tray tables.

But Delta is changing the status quo with the introduction of a new product that's focused on privacy, comfort and storage space.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

On the A321neo, you'll find 20 first-class recliners in a standard 2-2 configuration spread across rows 1 through 5.

The first thing you'll notice about the new seats is the emphasis on privacy. Thanks to the winged shields jutting out from each seat (along with a large privacy divider between each seat), you'll (hopefully) feel like you're in your own cocoon, as compared to a traditional first-class recliner, which offers significantly less privacy.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

In addition to the fixed-in-place privacy dividers, Delta staggered the rows on the A321neo. This offset was intentional in order to add even more privacy for each passenger, said Ashley Garris, Delta's manager of onboard brand experience, during the tour. This way, you'll only see your neighbor's privacy divider, and not their face, during the flight.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

The first-class recliners are 21 inches wide and feature 5 inches of recline and 37 inches of pitch. I'll reserve judgment on the seat comfort until I actually get a chance to fly on the jet for a six-hour transcontinental flight.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

While the leather seat padding is stitched in Delta's classic zigzag pattern, some flyers might feel that the padding isn't as plush or thick as it is on older jets.

Meanwhile, the headrest can be raised or lowered, and it can be adjusted to create a cradle for your neck, which should help make it easier to sleep during longer domestic flights.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Unlike the airline's long-haul premium economy product, these seats don't feature a leg rest or footrest. They do, however, have leather padding at calf level, which provides additional comfort when seated upright.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

If there's one downside to the new seat, it's the footwell area. That's because there's an entertainment and power box that ""pancakes"" the seat-support column. This cuts into both your underseat storage and space for your feet.

In terms of storage, there are plenty of nooks for all your belongings. You can leave a purse or laptop in the underseat storage unit, store a water bottle in the area under the armrest and tuck your phone into the seat's side pocket.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Plus, you can leave some loose items on the cocktail tray.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Each recliner sports a 13-inch high-definition touchscreen monitor, which is configured with Delta's latest wireless inflight entertainment system, which was developed by the airline's in-house Delta Flight Products startup. There are over 500 movies and over 100 TV shows loaded on the entertainment system.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

The screen can even be tilted upward to provide a range of viewing angles.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Finally, the bi-fold tray table, which measures 22 inches wide and 10 inches long, is a bit larger than average and comfortably fit my 13-inch MacBook Pro.

42 Comfort+ extra-legroom seats

While the first-class cabin is the showstopper on the A321neo, Delta didn't forget about the majority of passengers who fly in coach.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

The seats themselves feature more leather-covered memory-foam padding than you'll find in Delta's older products.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Both the extra-legroom Comfort+ cabin and standard economy cabin are arranged in a 3-3 configuration.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Comfort+ seats sport 34 inches of pitch, compared to 31 inches in standard coach, and all seats measure 18 inches wide.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

While the hard product isn't revolutionary, it's great that Delta installed a whopping 42 Comfort+ seats on the A321neo, which represents a net increase of 13 Comfort+ seats compared to the A321ceo, or ""current engine option.""

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

With more Medallion elite members taking to the skies than ever, having a larger Comfort+ section means there are more premium seats available for an upgrade.

Tray tables measure 16 1/2 inches wide and 8 1/2 inches long.

132 economy seats

The remainder of the plane is outfitted with 132 coach seats.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

With supportive leather-covered memory-foam padding, these seats are quite comfortable.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

All coach seats feature a high-definition 10-inch seatback entertainment system, along with other enhancements that you'll find throughout the aircraft, detailed below.

Nose-to-tail enhancements

All travelers on the A321neo will enjoy a slew of upgrades that aren't limited to a particular cabin.

Perhaps the most exciting is the introduction of the Airspace XL overhead bins, which can hold 60% more luggage than previous storage compartments. These larger bins should help limit the number of bags that need to be gate-checked.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

Another improvement, especially for longer flights, is the introduction of snazzy mood lighting that can be adjusted for various phases of the flight, including meal service, cruise and takeoff/landing.

The A321neo has four lavatories. The forward one is reserved for first-class passengers. You'll find another one right at the front of the coach cabin and two at the rear of the aircraft.

Previous slide Next slide 1 of 3 (Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy) 0 1 2

While not as small as the bathrooms on American's Boeing 737 MAX, these lavatories are noticeably more compact than those on older jets.

In terms of connectivity, the A321neo will feature Delta's latest Wi-Fi system: $5-per-device streaming internet access powered by Viasat. I've enjoyed fantastic speeds and reliable connectivity on my recent Delta Viasat flights, and the A321neo should offer the same. Delta also offers a free messaging option for those who don't want to pay for connectivity.

All seats feature two USB-A outlets for powering small mobile devices. Each first-class recliner has a universal power outlet, and there are two power outlets for every three coach seats.

(Photo by Zach Griff/The Points Guy)

For flight attendants, there are two galleys on the plane — one in front of first class and another at the rear of the aircraft. There's also a jump seat that extends out from the rear galley into the center aisle, which can be moved after taxi, takeoff or landing.

Where to sit on Delta's A321neo

If you're looking to maximize your comfort, it pays to select a prime seat.

When flying in first class, I'd pick either row 2 or 3, since both of these rows have two full windows. I'd also do whatever I can to avoid the bulkhead, as the seatback screens are fixed into the wall, legroom is limited and there's just one window in this row.

You may also want to avoid Row 5, since there's no bulkhead wall behind this row, and it bleeds directly into the coach cabin and nearby lavatory.

In Comfort+, I'd avoid the bulkhead row 12 (ABC) and rows 10 through 12, given the proximity to the lavatory. Otherwise, the remaining extra-legroom seats are all quite similar.

In coach, be sure to steer clear of Row 30, since it is missing windows entirely. Delta designates some other coach seats as ""preferred,"" which can be assigned for an additional charge (or complimentary, depending on your SkyMiles Medallion tier).

There are two exit rows, rows 19 and 20, both of which are considered ""preferred"" seating. With 39 inches of pitch, I'd definitely consider sitting here, though I'd avoid Row 19 since it has limited recline.

Bottom line

All in all, the A321neo ushers in a new era for domestic travel on Delta.

Perhaps most exciting are the nose-to-tail enhancements. From faster Wi-Fi to power outlets to oversized storage bins, flying on Delta's A321neo should be a nice upgrade for everyone."
"Airbus plans to expand in Mobile, seeing strong demand for A320 - AL.com","Wed, 04 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsLmNvbS9uZXdzL21vYmlsZS8yMDIyLzA1L2FpcmJ1cy1wbGFucy10by1leHBhbmQtaW4tbW9iaWxlLXNlZWluZy1zdHJvbmctZGVtYW5kLWZvci1qZXQtaXQtYnVpbGRzLXRoZXJlLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has set an aggressive growth plan for production of its A320 aircraft, with expansion in Mobile that apparently will include a whole new Final Assembly Line.

If confirmed, that would mean Airbus would add a third assembly line to the two it currently has at the Brookley Aeroplex on the shore of Mobile Bay: One for the a320 family of single-aisle jets, one for the smaller A220 family. Airbus is also competing for an Air Force tanker contract and has said it’ll build a line for those jets in Mobile if it wins the deal.

Airbus released quarterly earnings on Wednesday. Among the news in that report, Airbus said it was sticking with, and accelerating, plans for the ramp-up in A320 production slowed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The report said that the company is aiming for a production rate of 65 A320 jetliners per month by summer 2023, and is is now working with its suppliers and partners to enable monthly production rates of 75 in 2025.

“Airbus will meet the higher production rates by increasing capacity at its existing industrial sites and growing the industrial footprint in Mobile, US, while investing to ensure that all commercial aircraft assembly sites are A321-capable,” said the earnings report.

While “growing the industrial footprint” is not very specific, some media outlets have reported that Airbus CEO Guillame Faury was more detailed as he answered questions after the release of the report. The Financial Times and U.S. News & World Report said that Faury told reporters a new Final Assembly Line for Mobile was part of the plan.

An Airbus spokesman confirmed to AL.com that Faury had made statements to that effect.

Airbus notified media on Wednesday that it plans an “economic investment and workforce announcement” for Monday in Mobile. That announcement will follow up on “today’s news that Mobile will play a key role in Airbus’ plans to significantly increase global production rates in coming years,” the company said.

Mobile Airport Authority President Chris Curry said he could add nothing to the information released in the earnings report.

Industry analysts have contrasted Airbus’s growth plan to Boeing, which is taking a much slower approach to ramping up production of its 737 Max jetliner. Demand for that model was affected not only by the pandemic but by a problem that caused two crashes and required corrective work. Production for the 737 Max remains in the low 30s per month, according to most industry reports."

The Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (Comac) completed a three-hour test flight at the Pudong International Airport in Shanghai on Saturday morning, according to a statement on its website.

""This marked a successful test flight of the first C919 plane ahead of its delivery to the first customer,"" Comac said. ""The flight test completed all the scheduled tasks, and the aircraft performed well and was in good condition.""

The successful test flight is a boost for state-owned Comac, which received 28 customer orders for as many as 815 C919 aircraft, according to its website. The test showed how Shanghai's authorities are determined to get business activities back on their feet, after sending the city into lockdown since April 1.

As many as 3,000 of Comac's staff had been working under ""closed-loop"" conditions - where they had to undergo daily tests for Covid-19 and sleep on site to ensure zero contact with outsiders - to get the aircraft to its flight-ready stage, the manufacturer said.

Shanghai's hometown carrier China Eastern Airlines is poised to take delivery of five of the C919 aircraft, bought at a catalogue price of US$99 million each in a March 2021 agreement. China's third-largest carrier plans to use the new aircraft on domestic routes from Pudong to Beijing, Guangzhou. Shenzhen and Chengdu, China Eastern said.

Components of C919. Photo:Twitter alt=Components of C919. Photo:Twitter>

China is among the world's fastest-growing civil-aviation markets, and the C919 is the nation's ambitious attempt to manufacture its first commercial jetliner to meet its own rising demand.

The success of the project would be economically beneficial for China, as it could break the country's dependence on the duopoly currently enjoyed by Boeing and Airbus, and has the potential to catapult Comac into the multibillion-dollar aviation industry.

C919 was highlighted by President Xi Jinping in his 2017 report to China's legislature during the 19th National Congress, to serve as a driver of China's ""new model of development,"" along with other scientific achievements.

Comac started developing the C919 in 2008, but missed the previous deadline of delivering its first plane by the end of 2021.

While the C919 marks China's effort to reduce reliance on Airbus and Boeing, the aircraft still depends on foreign companies like General Electric and Honeywell for many critical parts.

As relations between Beijing and Washington DC have soured, the US government has tightened its regulations over the sales of aviation products to China, potentially adding hurdles to the development of the C919.

On January 14, 2021, the US Department of Defence added nine Chinese companies, including Comac, to its list of ""Communist Chinese military companies"".

Under an earlier executive order signed in 2020 by then president Donald Trump, American investors were prohibited from certain transactions in securities related to certain listed companies. Comac is not a publicly traded company, but it has sold bonds in the Chinese securities market.

Earlier in 2020, the US government was weighing whether to deny General Electric's request to provide the LEAP engines for the C919. It eventually approved the licence for the jet-engine sales after the then President Donald Trump said the US should not prevent companies from supplying jet engines and other components to China.

The members of the Air Mobility Initiative include Airbus, City of Ingolstadt, Deutsche Bahn, Deutsche Flugsicherung, Diehl Aerospace, Droniq, Munich Airport, Red Cross, and Telekom.

Air Mobility Initiative will pursue urban air mobility within and between German cities. Productions Autrement Dit and Airbus Helicopters Image

This initiative, which is supported by the Free State of Bavaria and the Federal Republic of Germany, will set up a series of research projects aimed at making urban air mobility within and between cities a reality. The joint projects are centered around three main areas: electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, unmanned traffic management (UTM) services, airport & city integration including vertiports.

“In many parts of the world, eVTOLs will offer a whole new mobility service in the near future,” said Markus May, Head of Operations for urban air mobility at Airbus. “Airbus and the AMI partners are aware that the introduction of such a system requires the cooperation of many players with different competences. Our goal is to build a transport service that benefits society and this is what we are setting up here in Bavaria.”

In a first step, the AMI partners will address the technological, infrastructural, legal, and social prerequisites for the future implementation of advanced air transport. Subsequently, the knowledge gained will be carried through a demonstration project under real conditions with eVTOLs.

Airbus is leading the vehicle stream together with Diehl Aerospace, University of Stuttgart and other partners. The UTM activities will deal with the safe and efficient flight of vehicles on their routes in and outside cities. This area is being advanced together with Droniq, Airbus, f.u.n.k.e. Avionics, SkyFive, BrigkAir, DFS, Telekom, Universities from Munich and Hamburg and other partners. Through the vertiport activities, AMI will work on take-off and landing sites for the aircraft as well as their integration into airports and cities. Munich Airport, Deutsche Bahn, Bauhaus Luftfahrt, Airport Nürnberg, Universities of Ingolstadt and Munich are responsible for this topic.

Work on the individual AMI projects began in January 2022. The test flights of the demonstration project will be carried out in the region around Ingolstadt. The initiative is funded with a total of €17 million from the Free State of Bavaria and €24 million from the Federal Government. Together with the industry’s own funds, this results in a total activity of € 86 million over a period of three years.

Airbus A220 on Asia-Pacific Demonstration Tour - Airbus,"Tue, 03 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMi0wNS1haXJidXMtYTIyMC1vbi1hc2lhLXBhY2lmaWMtZGVtb25zdHJhdGlvbi10b3Vy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"#Airbus #A220 #AsiaPacific

Sydney, 3 May 2022 – Airbus has deployed the A220 passenger aircraft to the Asia-Pacific region as part of its latest demonstration tour. The aircraft, an airBaltic A220-300, made a demonstration flight in Sydney (Australia) and will next fly to Singapore. The week-long campaign will see the aircraft make another two stops in Hanoi (Vietnam) and Tokyo (Japan).

On each leg, invited guests will tour the airBaltic aircraft, which features a comfortable layout of 145 seats in a single class passenger cabin. Airbus executives will also give product briefings of the A220 and guests can enjoy a demonstration flight.

The A220’s range and capacity make it ideal for carriers that want to open new regional routes out of Asia-Pacific, or require an aircraft for lucrative but thin routes out of the country. It also enables a more cost-efficient and seamless way to connect to and from international services to domestic and regional destinations.

The A220 is available in two versions, with the -100 variant seating between 100 and 130 passengers and the larger -300 variant seating between 130 and 160 in typical airline layouts. The A220 is also ideal for airlines that require an aircraft to complement the existing A320 Family.

By incorporating state-of-the-art technologies, the latest aerodynamic design and new generation Pratt & Whitney PW1500G geared turbofan engines, the A220 generates fuel savings of up to 25 per cent compared with older generation aircraft of a similar size.

Capable of flying non-stop on routes of up to 3,400 nautical miles (6,300 km), the A220 offers unmatched range capability allowing connections between the Asia-Pacific region, with Australia, North Asia and the Middle East.

Today, the A220-300 is operated in the Asia-Pacific region by Korean Air on both domestic and international services with 10 aircraft. Australia’s Qantas announced this week that it is ordering 20 aircraft as part of its domestic fleet replacement programme. Air Vanuatu has also ordered three A220s, comprising two A220-100s and one A220-300. To date, Airbus has received 740 orders for the A220 and delivered more than 200.

Asia-Pacific is a core market for Airbus and it is the fastest growing market for air transport with 5.5% annual growth in passenger traffic (versus a global average of 4.3%). Today the region accounts for a third of the European manufacturer’s total order book and a third of its revenues."
"China Closes Airspace to Russian Airbus, Boeing Aircraft - Airways Magazine","Sat, 28 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vYWlyd2F5c21hZy5jb20vY2hpbmEtY2xvc2VzLWFpcnNwYWNlLXJ1c3NpYS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"DALLAS – China is prohibiting Russian Boeing and Airbus aircraft owned by foreign leasing companies from flying through its territory.

According to the Russian news outlet RBK (RBC Group), the ban affects equipment whose legal status has not been confirmed following Western sanctions as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and their re-registration in Russia.

According to the report, China has requested proof that the aircraft in question are no longer registered outside of Russia. The sanctions imposed by the West in response to the Russian invasion on February 24 provide context.

Because of the military assault authorized by the Kremlin, the EU and the US have banned the supply, maintenance, and insurance of civilian aircraft and spare parts to Russia.

Western leasing companies that have terminated their Russian contractors own a large portion of Russia’s air fleet. Moscow, for its part, has refused to return the planes and has re-registered them without delay. In addition, Russian aviation rules were rewritten in March and May, removing various safety regulations related to maintenance and certification.

Dealing with Foreign, Domestic Flight Bans

In May, Chinese aviation authorities asked all airlines, not only Russian ones, to update their electronic dossiers or portfolios that contain information about aircraft, owners of airlines, and ground handling contracts. Requesting such portfolios is a standard procedure. As per RBK, the procedure has recently been amended in China.

According to RBK, Russian airlines have been unable to produce such documents. This is why the Chinese aviation authorities, observing international air law, have denied the flights of such planes.

Adding the sanctions hurting non-Russian-made aircraft maintenance and components, and the country’s extension of the flight ban at 11 domestic airports, Russian airlines are to face an uphill battle to keep their planes in the air.

DALLAS – On July 1, 2022, ANA (NH) will resume operations with its Airbus A380s on its flagship Tokyo, Honolulu route.

Dubbed ‘Flying Honu’, the airline’s three A380s and their distinct, colorful turtle liveries have become favorites of aviation enthusiasts and travelers alike.

The aircraft are fitted with 520 seats, including eight First Class Suites, 56 Business Class seats, and 78 Premium Economy seats. Additionally, NH offers 383 economy class seats, 60 of which are Couch seats.

Following its entry into service in May 2019, the aircraft became a temporary casualty of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on travel and aviation.

The aircraft have undergone flights since then for maintenance purposes, and to keep the aircraft and its crew current.

JA381A, for example, has flown once per month since October in a flight pattern that took it south to Kyushu, north to Sendai, and then finally back to Tokyo.

The A380’s will operate from July 1, 2022 to October 29, 2022, twice a week on Fridays and Saturdays with flight numbers NH184 and NH183.

Why the A380, ANA?

The story of NH’s A380s date back to 2011, when Skymark Airlines (BC) ordered four of the aircraft type. But the order was fraught with difficulties as the low-cost airline dealt with financial struggles.

Three years later, Airbus had assembled the first of the aircraft, with deliveries scheduled. Airbus lost confidence in the airline’s ability to pay for the aircraft, and subsequently cancelled the order.

As part of a restructuring agreement for BC, NH took on three Airbus A380s, becoming the final customer of the aircraft type. ANA took delivery of the aircraft in 2019, deploying them strictly on the Tokyo, Honolulu route.

At the time of delivery, Shinya Katanozaka, President and CEO of ANA Holdings Inc said, “We will commit all three of our Airbus A380 to the Tokyo Honolulu route with the goal of introducing a new level of luxury service to our passengers flying ANA on the number one resort route for Japanese travelers.”

Russia's Aeroflot Buys 8 Stranded Airbus A330 Aircraft From Leasing Firms - Insurance Journal,"Mon, 16 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc3VyYW5jZWpvdXJuYWwuY29tL25ld3MvaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC8yMDIyLzA1LzE2LzY2Nzc2Mi5odG3SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Russia’s biggest airline, Aeroflot, said on Friday it had bought eight Airbus A330 aircraft from foreign leasing companies “as part of the fulfillment of contractual obligations.”

More than 400 aircraft leased from Western firms, worth almost $10 billion, have been stranded in Russia since Western sanctions forced the lessors to terminate their contracts and Russia barred its airlines from returning the planes.

Aircraft Lessors Begin ‘Vigorous’ Pursuit of Insurance Claims for Seized Jets in Russia

Aeroflot did not specify which firms the aircraft had been leased from. But the purchase could be a bid to maintain good relations with lessors by making use of an exemption to European Union sanctions against Russia in respect of aircraft financial leases – which involve purchase when the lease ends.

To ensure that they can continue to have valid airworthiness certificates and Russian airlines can keep using them, Russian authorities have been transferring the aircraft to Russia’s own registry.

Meanwhile, leasing firms have resigned themselves to lengthy insurance claims to try to recover some of the lost value of the aircraft.

The largest claim has been made by Dublin-based AerCap, the world’s biggest aircraft lessor, which has submitted a $3.5 billion insurance claim for more than 100 jets.

AerCap did not immediately respond to Reuters calls seeking comment.

EU regulations governing sanctions imposed in response to Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine generally prohibit “the award and continued execution of public contracts and concessions with Russian nationals and entities or bodies established in Russia.” Aeroflot is majority-owned by the Russian state.

But one of the exemptions enacted on April 8 says national authorities in the EU may authorize “the execution of an aircraft financial lease concluded before 26 February 2022,” as long as it is “strictly necessary to ensure lease re-payments” and no payment is made beyond the transfer of the aircraft.

Boeing holding job fair in Mobile one week after Airbus announces expansion - NBC 15 WPMI,"Fri, 13 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vbXluYmMxNS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9haXJidXMtY29tcGV0aXRvci1wb3NzaWJseS1sb29raW5nLXRvLXBvYWNoLXRhbGVudNIBVWh0dHBzOi8vbXluYmMxNS5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvYWlyYnVzLWNvbXBldGl0b3ItcG9zc2libHktbG9va2luZy10by1wb2FjaC10YWxlbnQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In a bold move, Airbus' main competitor is coming to Mobile next week to try and snag some of the area's workforce.

Boeing will be in the Port City for the first time since it snagged a $40 million Air Force contract away from Airbus in 2011.

Boeing announced it will hold a job fair at the Renaissance Mobile Riverview Plaza Hotel on Wednesday from 11:00 a.m. to 3 p.m.

This comes just four days after Airbus announced a major expansion at Brookley Field, with a new assembly line that would bring 1000 jobs to the area and could deliver 8 planes each month.

In a press release, Boeing announced it is looking for ""engineering, manufacturing, and Supply Chain and Quality professionals.""

""The airline industry is booming. Boeing and Airbus are looking for people who are competent, smart, sharp and have desire to succeed and it just so happens Airbus is huge down here,"" said Richard Levy, an aviation expert and former airline captain.

Levy said he's not surprised Boeing would target the area due to its rapid growth and the need for aerospace workers.

However, the move also comes after national reports suggest Airbus has overtaken Boeing in the number of new jet orders.

""You have a vibrant Airbus manufacturing center here and Boeing is coming into their back yard to recruit. Its supply and demand, and competition,"" Levy added.

According to reports, in 2011, after Airbus was awarded a $40-million contract to build Air Force refueling tankers, Boeing got involved and lobbied federal legislators until the deal was reversed.

Boeing's job fair next week is offering on the spot interviews, sign-on bonuses, and relocation.

NBC 15 reached out to Airbus today for comment. It released the following statement:

""The aerospace workforce in Mobile is among the best in the world, and it's gratifying to see other companies recognize what we've known since we came to Mobile more than 15 years ago. However, Airbus' focus is on creating more high-quality, high-paying jobs for our community right here in Mobile, rather than hundreds of miles away.

NBC 15 reached out to Mayor Sandy Stimpson's office and the Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce. Both declined to comment on Boeing's visit.

With the Airbus announcement on Monday, Mobile is on the cusp of becoming the 4th largest aircraft production city in the world.

First delivery Airbus A321XLR slips to early 2024 | - AirInsight,"Wed, 04 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vYWlyaW5zaWdodC5jb20vZmlyc3QtZGVsaXZlcnktYWlyYnVzLWEzMjF4bHItc2xpcHMtdG8tZWFybHktMjAyNC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Care to share?

UPDATE – Entry into service of the Airbus A321XLR has slipped by a couple of months from late 2023 to early 2024. The delay is necessary to meet certification requirements, Airbus says in the release of its Q1 results. The airframer also confirmed that it will increase the production rate of the A320neo family to 75 in 2025. First delivery Airbus A321XLR slips to early 2024.

The slip in the XLR schedule shouldn’t be too worrying if it remains limited to just a few months. “We are in discussions with our customers to minimize the effects. We are really trying to stay on track and work hard to mitigate the effects for our customers”, said CEO Guillaume Faury. “When it comes to compensation for customers, we need to negotiate customer by customer and I can not share more. It (the delay) will not change the program as such.”

The most significant difference between the XLR compared to the A321neo and A321LR is the Rear Center Tank (RCT) which gives the XLR its 4.700nm/8.700km range. The position of the tank is subject to special attention from the regulators, especially after Boeing expressed concerns about the fire protection of the tank, which is right under the cabin. EASA stated that it will likely require extra measures to guarantee safety of the tank in the event of a fire. This could include additional insulation that would increase the weight of the XLR, potentially affecting its unique selling point – its range.

The Rear Center Tank, seen here on the very first A321XLR, is subject to further regulatory approval. (Airbus)

Faury said during today’s media and investor calls that it is not appropriate to specify what is causing the delay or what the European regulator EASA or FAA is requesting, except that it needs a bit more time to demonstrate the design to the regulators. Nor was he willing to say if the range of the XLR will be affected if regulators would make any requirements. Airbus said earlier it is confident that the RCT fully complies with safety. Airbus rolled out the first A321XLR in full livery from the paint shop in Hamburg earlier this week. The first flight is scheduled before the end of the current second quarter. The test campaign will include three aircraft.

Green light for rate 75 on the A32neo family from 2025

As the first delivery of the Airbus A321XLR slips to early 2024, Faury confirmed that Airbus will ramp up the rate of the A320neo-family to 75 per month from 2025. This is up from the current 43 per month and 65 that is planned from mid-2023. This follows the analysis of global customer demand and an assessment of the industry is ready for the higher rates. Faury said in January that a decision on a rate of seventy aircraft per month from 2024 was to be expected before this summer. Since then, Airbus has worked with suppliers and partners on confirming the higher rate. Last week, Safran and MTU (which supplies Pratt & Whitney) said they were ready for the higher rates. Airbus is comfortable enough to ramp up, given that the industry is coming out of the Covid crisis, said Faury. Between rate 65 in 2023 and 75 in 2025, there is time to adjust the schedule progressively and the supply chain, but Airbus has got positive signs that suppliers can manage the higher rates. Chief Financial Officer Dominik Asam added that higher rates will improve program margins.

The ramp-up of the A321neo production will be accommodated across all production facilities, so Hamburg, Toulouse (where the former A380 final assembly line is reconfigured), Tianjin (China), and Mobile (Alabama). Airbus said in December that the XLR would be produced not just in Hamburg but elsewhere too.

As previously announced, A330 production will go to almost two aircraft per month by the end of this year and the A350 to six in early 2023.

Looking at the financials, Airbus Group reported a €1.219 billion net profit, up from €362 million in the first quarter of last year. It produced an Adjusted EBIT of €1.263 billion compared to €694 million in Q1 last year. This includes €-11 million in A380-related costs and €-13 million benefit in other costs, plus €+190 million in pre-delivery payment mismatch and balance sheet evaluation costs. Reported EBIT was €1.429 billion compared to €462 million. Group revenues ended at €12 billion flat versus €10.460 billion in 2021.

Commercial aircraft revenues up to 8.5 billion

Commercial Aircraft reported an EBIT Reported of €1.242 billion compared to €343 million, EBIT Adjusted of €1.065 billion versus €533 million. Revenues were €8.541 billion versus €7.272 billion. Airbus delivered 140 aircraft in Q1 compared to 125 in the same period last year. Deliveries exclude two A350s for Aeroflot that were officially transferred to the airline in December but were scheduled for actual delivery later. The sanctions on Russia following the invasion of Ukraine now prevent the delivery to Aeroflot. The aircraft are now in storage in Toulouse with engines removed. Net order intake for the quarter was 83 compared to -61 last year.

Concerns over deliveries to China

Sanctions on Russia impacted the Q1 result by €0.2 million. Airbus’ direct exposure is for the thirteen A350-900s on order from Aeroflot, but it didn’t mention orders by lessors that planned to place aircraft with Russian customers. For example, in Hamburg, three A321neo’s are in preparation for S7 Siberia Airlines but are now in inventory. Apart from aircraft for Russia, Airbus has around 100 aircraft in inventory because a part is missing following supply chain problems.

Another concern for Airbus is China. With continued Covid restrictions seriously having reduced air travel to some twenty to thirty percent of pre-Covid levels, Faury said that in the short term, this might impact the (financial) ability of some customers to take delivery of new aircraft. It is a risk, but how this works out during the year is unclear.

Despite challenges, Airbus upholds its previous guidance for 720 aircraft deliveries this year, EBIT Adjusted of €5.5 billion, and free cash flow before mergers and acquisitions and customer financing of €3.5 billion. This depends on no further disruptions to the world economy and internal operations. China, Russia, and supply chain issues make meeting the targets more difficult. Effects of higher energy prices are covered for this year, but inflation persists for long, it could be a problem for some suppliers and could require negotiations with suppliers. Airbus is seeing inflation of labor costs, with a new wage agreement with higher salaries recently concluded in the UK. The challenge is to conclude agreements that make sense for employees and Airbus, said Faury.

Airbus ended the quarter with €22.8 billion in gross cash and €7.7 billion in net cash, with €28.8 billion in liquidity."

XMA-ROTOR: result of a project in close collaboration between Airbus Helicopters and Safran - Safran,"Wed, 18 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhZnJhbi1ncm91cC5jb20vbmV3cy94bWEtcm90b3ItcmVzdWx0LXByb2plY3QtY2xvc2UtY29sbGFib3JhdGlvbi1iZXR3ZWVuLWFpcmJ1cy1oZWxpY29wdGVycy1hbmQtc2FmcmFuLTIwMjItMDUtMTjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Environment around the project: between technological challenges and constraints

The very nature of a technological innovation involves the exploration of extensive unknown terrain, especially on the technical level. The project teams worked in particularly close collaboration and were able to meet many challenges:

- transfer a very large amount of data without any loss with a wireless technology, despite very high rotation speeds and the masking effects generated by the rotation of the blades;

- allow the acquisition of a large variety of data, from most common sources, such as strain gages (quarter, half, full bridge), temperature sensors, accelerometers, but also the latest digital and/or fiber optic sensor technologies;

- synchronize all the data collected on the rotors with the other parameters of the helicopter, with the same level of accuracy as on a wired network;

- configure the system via the wireless link from a simple connection on the Ethernet network;

- provide power supply in the rotor zone: must be provided by wireless technology, without using a battery, and must include a function monitoring the proper functioning of the system.

In addition to meeting these technical challenges, the teams had to deal with various constraints: firstly, environmental constraints, with special emphasis on the vibratory aspects associated with the helicopter; secondly, in terms of installation and mechanical strength, since the system had to be compatible with installation on the rotors and guarantee safe flight; thirdly, it must be possible to install the system on any type of helicopter and aircraft.

XMA-ROTOR solution

The XMA-ROTOR data acquisition system is based on XMA technology, a platform proven by many players in civil and military aeronautics.

The particularity of the XMA ROTOR is that it embeds a hybrid wireless technology combining 2 ""wireless"" protocols. An additional advantage is that it is equipped with a high-performance inductive power supply system."
Did Airbus Once Make Two Boeings? The Super Guppy - Mentour Pilot,"Tue, 31 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vbWVudG91cnBpbG90LmNvbS90aGUtc3VwZXItZ3VwcHktZGlkLWFpcmJ1cy1vbmNlLW1ha2UtdHdvLWJvZWluZ3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Spyros Georgilidakis | May 31, 2022

The Super Guppy is a remarkable aircraft, because of its connection to NASA’s space program, its unique shape… and the fact Airbus made some!

The Super Guppy is a memorable aircraft, but many people don’t know its original role. This story takes us back to the early 1960s, way before Airbus even existed. It takes us back to NASA and the space race. And as with all things freighter-related, it’s about logistics. NASA was trying to put humans in space and on the moon, launching them from Cape Canaveral in Florida.

People studying the history of the space race probably know of NASA’s problems in getting its missiles to launch and fly reliably. But the organisation had another, lesser-known problem: getting the gigantic rocket parts to Florida, from the factories that made them! Many of the companies making this hardware were on the American west coast.

Aero Spacelines Super Guppy – Its Origins

Smaller parts could travel by road or rail. But eventually, some parts just got too big. NASA needed something else. Many rocket stages went all the way south to the Panama Canal, and back up north, along the Gulf of Mexico! But eventually, the situation lead to an aircraft. We are of course referring to the Aero Spacelines Super Guppy. You’ll notice we didn’t write ‘Boeing Super Guppy’ there.

The idea was as outrageous, as it was simple. In 1960, airlines were disposing of their Boeing 377 Stratocruisers. Boeing’s 377 was an early pressurized airliner, essentially the civilian version of the C-97 “Stratofreighter”. In turn, this was a post-war freighter version of the B-29 Superfortress bomber. The 377 Stratocruiser was an impressive and well-received aircraft.

Unfortunately for Boeing, it wasn’t successful. Only 56 377s entered commercial service. Clearly, jets like the 707 were the future, and they were on the way. The military C-97/KC-97s were more successful, but the US Air Force soon wanted to replace them with the new KC-135. Jack Conroy, a former WWII pilot, airline pilot and all-around enterprising individual, got an idea.

Conroy would use ultra-cheap Boeing 377 Stratocruisers, to build an outsize transport plane. This was “The Pregnant Guppy”, the Super Guppy’s precursor. Making this modification wasn’t easy, but this was the 50s and 60s. The pace with which aviation was evolving back then, is nothing like what we know today.

Building The First Plane

The Pregnant Guppy mostly used the airframe of an ex-PanAm 377 Stratocruiser. To stretch it, more parts came from a British Overseas Airways Corp (BOAC) 377. These aircraft parts came from an aircraft broker in California, who had been collecting retired Stratocruisers! Unlike the future Super Guppy, this first jet kept the radial piston engines. The wing and the control surfaces were largely unchanged. But of course, the upper fuselage underwent a transformation.

A normal 377 Stratocruiser has a ‘double-bubble’ appearance. In other words, the fuselage isn’t a perfect cylinder; a smaller-radius section at the bottom meets the rest of the fuselage on its sides. When the Pregnant Guppy emerged, the transformation had given it a ‘triple bubble’ appearance. Most future Super Guppy aircraft wouldn’t get this feature.

The Pregnant Guppy’s upper section had a diameter of six meters (19,7 feet). To load it, crews would detach the entire tail section of the aircraft completely. Then after loading they would reattach it, connecting and adjusting all electrics and flight controls. This process would change somewhat for the Super Guppy, but it always remained an Achilles heel for the aircraft.

For the first test flight, the 377 fuselage was intact, with the bulbous upper section simply superimposed on it. Even so, legend has it that when the Van Nuys air traffic controllers realized that Jack Conroy and his co-pilot intended to take off for the first time, they alerted the police and fire departments. The flight went ahead uneventfully, but these controllers weren’t alone in being a bit sceptical.

From Pregnant Guppy To Super Guppy

NASA had their reservations about this first plane, too. But the agency would soon change its tune, thanks in part to support from Wernher Von Braun himself. Rocket components generally are very bulky, but relatively light for their size. So, the Pregnant Guppy was ideal for rocket stages in the early days of the space program. Specifically, Conroy sized the aircraft’s fuselage to fit the S-IV, i.e. the second stage of the early Saturn I rocket.

The aircraft became operational in 1963, carrying its first S-IV stage from California to Florida. This was an 18-hour job, instead of the 20-25 days that the barge across the Panama Canal would take – weather-permitting! NASA was super happy with its Pregnant Guppy. But its engineers knew that future rocket parts would be bigger. So Aero Spacelines Inc. (Jack Conroy’s company) built just one Pregnant Guppy, with tail number N1024V.

This is where the Super Guppy comes in. In addition to having a larger fuselage, it also had a front, hinged door. This made loading a bit easier, but it still required disconnecting and re-connecting (AND testing) control cables and wiring. It first flew in August 1965 and had registration N940NS (later N1038V).

This Super Guppy was the aircraft that would carry most of the large sections of the Saturn V rocket to Cape Kennedy and other NASA sites, with the Pregnant Guppy also in service. But Aero Spacelines Inc. (ASI) believed that there would be more demand for such aircraft. So the company got busy designing a more refined and more capable variant.

Super Guppy Turbine And Airbus

This definitive version is called the Super Guppy Turbine – even though the earlier ‘Super’ version also had turboprop engines. But the SGT had T56 engines, the same type as those on the C-130 Hercules, or the Lockheed Electra and P-3 Orion. The first SGT flew in 1970. And this (finally) is where Airbus comes into this story. Still a new aircraft manufacturer, Airbus originally planned to be just an ASI customer.

The idea was that ASI would operate the aircraft for Airbus. However, this plan would soon change. By this time, ASI (later Tracor Aviation) was in financial trouble. So Airbus would buy one aircraft, with a second as an option. Note here that the Super Guppy Turbine was the first Guppy to have cockpit pressurization, allowing higher cruise altitudes. It was also the first Guppy with type certification as a commercial aircraft. Previous variants had a special US status as “Public Aircraft”.

Airbus took delivery of the first aircraft in 1971. The second one was an option, which the company eventually bought in 1973. Later, the European manufacturer expanded its operations – and its ambitions. So in 1979, Airbus agreed to a deal with ASI that would see it get two more Super Guppy Turbines. But to get them, Airbus would have to make them! Or, have them made in Europe.

Building The Aircraft In Europe

ASI and its successor did provide Airbus with some sub-assemblies for the aircraft. So is it correct to say that Airbus made them? In theory, yes, because Airbus got the right to produce the aircraft. But oddly, the actual builder of Super Guppy Turbine No3 and No4 was Union de Transports Aériens. UTA is better known today as a former airline, that eventually merged with Air France. But it had a sizeable MRO (maintenance repair overhaul) operation as well.

So UTA was the main subcontractor, for the build of Airbus’ newer two Super Guppy Turbines. Is it then correct to say that Airbus built two “Boeings”? The short answer is “no”. But there is a bit more to it than that. As its design evolved, the Guppy used fewer and fewer parts from the original Boeing 377 Stratocruiser (or the C-97).

The original Pregnant Guppy and the first Super Guppy retained the lower half of the 377 fuselage. However, the latest ‘SGT’ variant had an all-new fuselage with a simpler cross-section. It lacked the double or triple-bubble appearance. But it had a wider floor. So aside from some key fittings, the Super Guppy Turbine didn’t have a Boeing fuselage.

Lengthy Service – And A “Return” To NASA

However, the SGT still had a Boeing 377 cockpit, the wings, most of the tail and the main landing gear. The nose gear was not from a 377; but it came from a different Boeing, the 707! Airbus may not have made two Boeings, but it got the right to make aircraft with key structural Boeing parts. Ultimately, we could argue that this is a question of grammar. Either Airbus almost made two Boeings, or it made two aircraft that almost were Boeings.

Airbus kept all four Super Guppy Turbines in service until the 1990s. As we have seen, it replaced them with the A300-600ST (super transporter), a design modification of the A300-600R. To most of the world, this is the Airbus Beluga. And somewhat fittingly, it, too, has transported rocket components for NASA and ESA. The first Beluga entered service in 1996.

One of the Airbus-made Super Guppy Turbines is still in service today, with NASA. This is SGT No4, which originally had tail number F-GEAI. NASA bought it in 1997, giving it tail number N941NA. Isn’t it ironic? An aircraft designed to carry rocket parts, but built (in this case) to carry aircraft components, still ended up carrying newer rocket parts…

Airbus’ newer Beluga and Beluga XL may be easier to operate, finally eliminating the need to disconnect and reconnect vital flight controls. But the Pregnant Guppy and Super Guppy variants all played their important roles. The earlier aircraft certainly helped NASA reach the moon, solving nightmarish logistical problems. And obviously, they look very cool!

The last two satellites of the Airbus-built, owned and operated Pléiades Neo constellation are on track for launch later this year, following successful final tests in Toulouse’s clean rooms.

Following the seamless parallel integration of both Pléiades Neo 5 and 6 satellites, and the successful conclusion of the environment (thermal vacuum, acoustic, vibration) test campaign, both final spacecraft are now ready to complete the Pléiades Neo constellation.

Both satellites are due to be launched simultaneously on the Vega C European launcher from Kourou, in French Guiana. To tackle this dual launch, the Airbus space engineers came up with a smart and efficient dispenser-free design where the satellites are stacked on top of each other, linked only by a clamp band.

Vega-C is a single body rocket about 35 m high with a mass at liftoff of 210 tonnes. It is able to place about 2200 kg in a reference 700 km polar orbit. This will meet the needs of European institutions and industry. Artistic rendition is courtesy of ESA.

This compact dispenser-free launch configuration saves volume and mass, as well as reducing cost. Simultaneously testing both satellites in their stacked launch configuration enabled significant time saving, with only four days needed to pass both the three axes Sine testing and the acoustic test.

”With this new bold, dispenser-free design, we were able to seamlessly integrate and test these two very high resolution satellites and ensure an optimised launch configuration: in a single launch, we will double the acquisition capacity of the Pléiades Neo constellation, and offer even greater responsiveness to our customers,” said Philippe Pham, Head of Earth Observation and Science at Airbus.

Comprising four identical satellites, the Pléiades Neo constellation will work hand in hand with the existing Pléiades satellites and the rest of the Airbus Earth Observation (EO) satellite fleet. The highly compact Pléiades Neo spacecraft have a light weight, next generation silicon carbide optical instrument. They also have laser comms inter-satellite links with SpaceDataHighway (EDRS—European Data Relay System) geostationary satellites to enable urgent acquisitions in just 30 to 40 minutes following a tasking request to swiftly respond to the most critical situations."

It’s the dream of any aviation geek to visit OEM factories for a behind-the-scenes look into the makings of the flying machines. Airbus’s factory tour in Mobile, Alabama is the latest addition to this amazing collection of experiences.

I finally got my chance to partake in the tour in March 2022. This report is a summary of what I found interesting while visiting. Due to the company’s no photo policy, I do not have any pictures from inside the factory.

Background

Airbus has a long history in Mobile, Ala. The company opened an MRO center for military aircraft here back in 2009 before adding its commercial operations to the area in 2015. It started with a single Final Assembly Line for the Airbus A320 family. After Bombardier’s C Series program acquisition, the company added a new assembly line for the renamed Airbus A220 family in 2019. In May 2022, the European manufacturer announced plans to add a second A320 assembly line on its Alabama campus.

Flight Works Alabama (FWA) — a cooperative effort between the Airbus Foundation and the State of Alabama, conducts the touring operation. The organization started offering factory tours in November 2020.

Booking

At the moment, FWA offers tours about once a month. The company usually announces dates a few months in advance. The tours are generally on Saturdays and have a few starts from the morning to early afternoon. Since the tours do not operate on a set schedule, you need to check tour dates on FWA’s social media platforms and website. The operator did not explicitly request advanced reservations for visiting the factory. However, most slots will sell out, so you should book your ticket before your visit.

Tour ticket costs $23.50 each, which also includes admission to the exhibition. Visitors must be at least ten years old and wear closed-toe shoes on the day of the visit. FWA also requires a government-issued I.D. for anyone over the age of eighteen.

Getting there

The plane manufacturer’s facility locates at Mobile International Airport – formerly known as Mobile Downtown Airport. Mobile Regional Airport is the closest commercial airport – about 30 minutes away from the visitor center. However, its flight options are very limited, and I could not find a connection to make a day trip work. Therefore I flew to New Orleans early in the morning and took a two-hour drive for the tour.

It’s worth noting that this is set to change. While Frontier Airlines has briefly served the Mobile Downtown Airport, no commercial passenger flight is available currently. However, Mobile County has announced its plans to build a new terminal at Mobile International Airport and move all commercial operations there. The new terminal could make visiting Airbus Mobile and the city of Mobile easier with its proximity to the Interstate highway. The county expects the transition to happen in late 2024.

The tour starts at a dedicated visitor center located at the north end of the Mobile Aeroplex at Brookley. Although there is a bus stop right outside the visitor center, the bus runs on a very thin schedule, so driving is the best option for attending the tour.

The exhibition

The entrance hall features a mural showing the city of Mobile and a Sharklets display across from the check-in desk. You will enter what FWA calls an aviation experience center once you pass the check-in counter. The exhibition there certainly lives up to its name.

FWA did an excellent job in creating the interactive experience. In addition to the typical flight simulators, an outdoor drone area and several games demonstrate the logistics of Airbus’ operations. The center fared well in enlightening visitors about the fundamentals of flying. I found many people waiting in line to try the aerodynamic test simulator. The way one can grab a physical design and see the simulated results appears to be a great touch on engaging people.

Apart from introducing the science behind flying, the exhibition also highlights the manufacturing processes of an airplane. It showcased them through hands-on workstations, which demonstrated each procedure with real tools. Some highlights include wiring assembly troubleshooting, proper torque application, etc. They also have a fastener display section so good that I’d want to have one at home and use it as a catalog.

The experience center is also home to many actual aircraft parts you can get up close and even pick up. Beyond winglets and landing gears that you might find in other exhibitions, there is also a nicely prepped A320 bulkhead to show the behind-the-scenes construction of an aircraft. The display reminds me of the Boeing 747 in the Delta Flight Museum exhibit. Still, I think this one is better prepared to show the granular details closely tied to manufacturing exhibitions. Besides that, I found the window assembly display to be one of the most interesting because you can move all the parts and understand the build-up of an A320 window.

The only complaint I have against the space was that its gift shop is too small. I would not mind having a more extensive selection of Airbus swags. The few airplane models in the shop were also very fairly priced.

The Tour

The tour is mainly similar to experiences offered at other aircraft manufacturing plants. A bus will take a group of people to the building, and there is also the no photography allowed rule.

Even though the facility is home to both A320 and A220 FALs, the A320 building is the only stop on this tour. Once the bus arrives at the production building, visitors need to walk up four flights to reach the viewing area.

Unlike Boeing’s famous moving production line, there are four discrete stages in the building. The first two stations are for structure joints, whereas the first joins the fwd and aft fuselage, while the second station joins the wing to the fuselage. The fourth station sees system integration for the aircraft then the aircraft gets its interior at the last station before rolling out of the factory. The stations travel unidirectionally, which is different from when I visited their Hamburg, Germany, factory in 2015.

Except for being stationary, the production line shares a lot of resemblance to its main competitor. While both companies have small office areas on the platforms and multiple rigs around the airplanes, the European company’s floor design looks cleaner and more simplified than its U.S. rival.

Since the touring operation is still fresh, the tour guides are not the most knowledgeable. Luckily, there are always enough aviation people in the group to answer questions raised by other visitors. Nonetheless, You’ll still learn a lot of interesting statistics and techniques about their production from the narration.

The entire tour is about one hour, including about 20 minutes to travel from and to the visitor center. On our way back, the tour guide mentioned they had received a lot of interest in A220 production line tours, and they were trying to work out a plan to provide that. However, there is no solid timeline for when that might be available.

Planespotting

One of the fun activities you can do around the factory is to see the special purpose vehicles that deliver the parts and spot the brand new airplanes.

As the name indicates, the FALs here are only responsible for assembling aircraft. The A320 fuselages arrive in the U.S. by ship, and the A220 fuselages come from Canada. You might be able to spot the Airbus Mobile Express cargo ship in the nearby Mobile bay. The vessel transports A320 components to the port once a month.

Eventually, parts for both types arrive at the factory by truck, which is mundane compared to Boeing’s Dreamlifter, Airbus’ Beluga, or even the train that carries Boeing 737 fuselages. Our guide did share one interesting fact to distinguish between the A320 and the A220 fuselages during the tour. A220 fuselages have covers over them while the A320s are exposed. You’ll be able to recognize the trucks next time you are in the area.

The area surrounding the factory is very accessible for planespotting. Planes are visible through the fences at a few parking lots along Aerospace Dr. During my visit, I saw a few Breeze Airway’s A220s on the flight line and an unpainted A220 in one of the open-air hangars nearby.

If you have time, check out Doyle Park on the west side of the complex. You might be able to spot a few test flights if you are lucky. The unique thing about Mobile’s operation is the aircraft carry foreign registries. The airplane normally uses temporary registration from the producing country in the manufacturer’s other FALs. For instance, Hamburg, Germany’s A320s start with D-, while Tianjin, China’s A320s begin with B-. However, all A320s produced in Mobile carry French registrations that start with F-, while all A220s have Canadian registrations that begin with C-.

Comparison to other tours

I have toured Boeing’s Everett, Wash, and Renton, Wash factories, as well as Airbus’ Hamburg factory. Each tour has its highlights, and here’s a short comparison of them.

Content

The Boeing Evertt tour undoubtedly has the most variety among these tours, with Boeing 747, 767, 777 and 787 on display. The Airbus Hamburg tour packs the second most content showing A320 FAL and production for Airbus A320, A330 and A350 components. They used to include A380 as part of the tour. However, it was not part of my tour when I visited Hamburg. It could have resulted from me taking the English version and not the German version, but that shows some inconsistency between the tour offerings.

Boeing Renton and Airbus Mobile tours are comparable, except the U.S.-based manufacturer have a much larger space and a moving line. However, the moving line looks still because it was moving at a very slow speed.

Form

With the exception of Airbus Hamburg, all the tours took place on a balcony. When I visited the European manufacturer’s German factory in 2015, we walked on the production floor, which made the airplanes all the more impressive. Boeing has offered floor tours at the Everett factory through events or organizations in the past. They are not-to-be-missed events.

Outreach Programs

FWA places a heavy emphasis on its educational outreach programs. Their offerings range from camps to certificates and career training programs.

A few workshop areas in the building offer equipment such as basic CNC machines and 3D printers. They also make outreach events a priority. I asked why there was no scheduled tour for the month of April when I visited and learned that they did not schedule tours to make room for camps at the center.

Their highlight program is FlightPath9. It provides a direct path to an apprenticeship at Airbus upon finishing the program. During my tour, there was even a FlightPath9 alumnus that landed a full-time job after completing his training. More information is available from FWA’s website.

Conclusion

Airbus and its partners created an overall awe-inspiring and engaging experience despite having a short and somewhat underwhelming tour. It is worth visiting if you are in the area, and I will come back if they make the A220 tour a reality.

10 week Bishop State program kicks off to train the next generation of Airbus employees - Fox 10 News,"Wed, 25 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDEwdHYuY29tLzIwMjIvMDUvMjUvMTAtd2Vlay1iaXNob3Atc3RhdGUtcHJvZ3JhbS1raWNrcy1vZmYtdHJhaW4tbmV4dC1nZW5lcmF0aW9uLWFpcmJ1cy1lbXBsb3llZXMv0gGAAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDEwdHYuY29tLzIwMjIvMDUvMjUvMTAtd2Vlay1iaXNob3Atc3RhdGUtcHJvZ3JhbS1raWNrcy1vZmYtdHJhaW4tbmV4dC1nZW5lcmF0aW9uLWFpcmJ1cy1lbXBsb3llZXMvP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MOBILE, Ala. (WALA) - A new program at Bishop State Community College kicking off Wednesday in partnership with Airbus.

The goal of the 10-week class is to get students ready to go for a career in aviation manufacturing.

This new program at Bishop State comes as Airbus looks to hire a thousand more people by 2025. The plane manufacturer says this class will help with that and the school is happy to be a part of it.

On Wednesday it was a busy first day for aviation manufacturing students at Bishop State. If participants play their cards right, they could be future Airbus employees.

“It’s going to be an experience, something very different than what I’ve ever done,” said Dianna Pierce.

Pierce is a former waitress. If she successfully moves through the program, she could soon be helping Airbus put planes together in Mobile.

“It seems like a long term, maybe retire from here one day,” she said. “It has everything I would be looking for in a job, it has great pay.”

After the 10-week class, the 50 students will transition to the Airbus apprenticeship program for 16 months where they will be full-time employees getting on-the-job training.

Michelle Hurdle from Airbus says programs like this help them find and train high-quality talent, especially as they look to go on a hiring spree over the next few years.

“This is one of the pipelines we’re creating, that along with our dual enrollment, along with our FlightPath 9 high school program,” she said. “These will be pipelines to get individuals directly employed by Airbus.”

Bishop State has partnerships with multiple companies to offer workforce training classes. Airbus is one of their newest and they are glad they are able to prepare students for their future.

“They’re getting the foundation for their apprenticeship as well as the training, plus the soft skills, just safety and stuff we’re really focusing on in each program,” said Daphne Stamps, Industry Liaison at Bishop State.

While it is only day one of the program, Aaron Coleman is looking forward to seeing what is ahead.

“Not really considering aviation before, but I’m excited to see what that would look like now because of this program,” he said.

The jobs Airbus would be offering these students are high-paying.

Bishop State says they plan to expand the class in the fall.

Airbus's New A321XLR Jetliner Faces Shorter Flight Times on Fire Safety Concerns - Bloomberg,"Wed, 04 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIyLTA1LTAzL2FpcmJ1cy1pcy1zYWlkLXRvLWZhY2UtcmFuZ2Utc3F1ZWV6ZS1vbi1rZXktYTMyMXhsci1tb2RlbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus SE may need to reduce the top range of its coming A321XLR jetliner, a key selling point for the new narrowbody, as European regulators seek to lessen the fire risk from an extra fuel tank in its rear fuselage, according to people familiar with the matter.

Improvements to fire safety design around the rear center tank are likely to add weight to the XLR and have a minor impact on how far it can fly, according to the people, who asked not to be named discussing a confidential matter. Some buyers have been told of potential changes to specifications, they said."
Qantas Plans World’s Longest Flights With Project Sunrise Airbus A350 Order - airlineweekly.skift.com,"Mon, 02 May 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vYWlybGluZXdlZWtseS5za2lmdC5jb20vMjAyMi8wNS9xYW50YXMtcGxhbnMtd29ybGRzLWxvbmdlc3QtZmxpZ2h0cy13aXRoLXByb2plY3Qtc3VucmlzZS1haXJidXMtYTM1MC1vcmRlci_SAXlodHRwczovL2FpcmxpbmV3ZWVrbHkuc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMjIvMDUvcWFudGFzLXBsYW5zLXdvcmxkcy1sb25nZXN0LWZsaWdodHMtd2l0aC1wcm9qZWN0LXN1bnJpc2UtYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtb3JkZXIvP2FtcD0x?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Qantas Airways has committed to the Airbus A350 for its long-delayed “Project Sunrise” ultra-long-haul Sydney-New York and Sydney-London flights.

In one camp, there are the travelers who do not mind almost 20 hours in an aircraft if it means shaving a few hours off their total trip. And in the other, there are those who will take the mid-trip opportunity to stretch their legs in places like Dubai or Los Angeles on treks around the world.

What’s clear is that the former camp — those clamoring for more, longer nonstops — are getting their way. Qantas’ finalized an order for 12 A350-1000s, which it first selected in 2019, for Project Sunrise. These aircraft would operate by far the longest proposed air routes and most audacious commitment to ultra-long haul flights to date. The nonstops from Sydney to London Heathrow and New York Kennedy will clock in at 10,573 miles and 9,950 miles, respectively, according to Great Circle Mapper. They roundly beat the current record holder — Singapore Airlines’ Singapore-New York nonstop — by almost 500 miles.

“The A350 and Project Sunrise will make any city just one flight away from Australia. It’s the last frontier and the final fix for the tyranny of distance,” Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said on May 2.

And Joyce has good reason to think the nonstops will succeed. Qantas launched nonstop flights to London from Perth — the first from the Australian continent — in 2017 and, despite many naysayers, it has been heralded as a success. Joyce said the Perth-London route had “strong demand” prior to the Covid-19 crisis, and “the highest customer satisfaction on our network.”

Qantas has yet to resume Perth-London nonstops but flights to London via Darwin, a gateway switch made due to travel restrictions in Western Australia, were among the first long-haul routes it resumed. And, also on May 2, the airline said demand to London via Darwin was above pre-crisis levels. The Darwin-London route clocks in at 8,611 miles, which puts it behind only Singapore Airlines’ Los Angeles and New York nonstops among the longest routes in operation globally.

Air New Zealand will enter the fray with its own Auckland-New York nonstop — an 8,828 mile route — from September 17.

For those travelers who do not mind the almost-20-hour flights, Qantas plans some plush furnishings. The airline will unveil new first-class and business-class suites on its A350s, as well as more spacious premium economy and economy options. And, in a recognition of the physical toll of such long flights, Qantas’ layout includes a “wellbeing zone” to promote “movement, stretching and hydration” for all passengers. The carrier will configure its A350-1000s with 238 seats, which is more than 100 fewer than Airbus’ typical three-class layout of at least 350 passengers for the aircraft.

Qantas anticipates delivery of its first A350-1000 in 2025 with flights to either London or New York beginning the same year.

Qantas’ finalization of the Project Sunrise aircraft is one facet of a broader fleet renewal program. The airline also firmed orders for 20 A220-300s and 20 A321XLRs on May 2 to replace its Boeing 717 and 737 aircraft by the end of the decade. The orders are part of a 134 aircraft commitment for the A220 and A320neo families that Qantas revealed in December. The airline has purchase right options with Airbus for the remaining 94 aircraft. The first A220 will arrive in late 2023 and be followed by the first A321XLR a year later.

All of the fleet moves come amid an improving outlook for Qantas. The airline said travel demand is recovering faster than forecast, which matches the outlooks given by most foreign carriers and particularly U.S. airlines. Qantas will fly 105 percent of its pre-pandemic domestic capacity in the June quarter — the final three-month period in its fiscal year that ends in June — and expects positive earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) for the segment for the first time since the crisis began. Domestic corporate demand has recovered to 85 percent of pre-Covid levels.

International is another story. Although demand continues to recover rapidly, Qantas noted that it remains depressed where travel restrictions are still in place. However, demand exceeds pre-pandemic levels in key markets, including to Bali, Johannesburg, London, and Los Angeles.

Qantas maintains its forecast of a fiscal 2022 loss but expects a profitable 2023 fiscal year. The airline anticipates positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of A$450-550 million ($317-388 million) during the six months ending in June."
