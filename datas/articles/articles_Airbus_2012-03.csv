Airbus faces €105m repair bill for A380 superjumbos' cracked wings - The Guardian,"Thu, 08 Mar 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDEyL21hci8wOC9haXJidXMtY29tcGVuc2F0aW9uLWEzODAtY3JhY2tlZC13aW5nc9IBV2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDEyL21hci8wOC9haXJidXMtY29tcGVuc2F0aW9uLWEzODAtY3JhY2tlZC13aW5ncw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus faces a repair bill of €105m (£87m) to fix cracks in the wings of its global fleet of A380 superjumbos.

Airbus's parent, the European aerospace and defence group EADS, revealed the cost at its annual results in Paris on Thursday morning, a month after safety checks for the state-of-the-art aircraft were extended to all 67 in service. The European Aviation Safety Agency has warned that if they are not detected the cracks inside the wings ""may lead to reduction of the structural integrity of the aeroplane"".

The EASA directives apply to two types of crack. The most serious defect, located in a specific area of the A380 wings, relates to brackets that attach the A380's wing ribs – the elongated, oval-shaped frames that run along the width of the wing – to the wing's metal skin. The cracks were caused by the stress generated when the brackets were fastened to the skin – a strain that was exacerbated by the flexing of the wings during flight.

A380 wings are built at the Airbus factory in Broughton, Wales, but it is understood that the most serious cracks are a design fault. The main Airbus wing design facility is at Filton near Bristol although the brackets at the centre of the safety scare were not made there. So far 18 planes have been checked for the most serious defect, dubbed a ""type two"" crack, and every plane must be checked before it reaches 1,300 flights in service. Aviation sources said that type two cracks had not been discovered in every inspection to date, although they had been found in some checks.

The A380's biggest customer is Dubai-based airline Emirates, which operates 20 of the 525-seater jets, followed by Singapore Airlines with 15, Qantas with 12, Lufthansa eight, Air France six, Korean Air five and China Southern two. The repair bill includes covering the cost of the checks and, if necessary, replacing cracked parts with new fittings. If serious cracks are detected, the flawed part is cut out and replaced by engineers.

EADS revealed on Thursday that 2011 sales rose 7% to €49.1bn from €45.7bn the year before, beating analysts' expectations of around €47.9bn. Full-year profit at the group, where Airbus is the biggest unit, grew 87% to just over €1bn."
Increase in news rattles confidence in plane makers | Arkansas Democrat Gazette - Arkansas Online,"Sun, 04 Mar 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMTIvbWFyLzA0L2luY3JlYXNlLW5ld3MtcmF0dGxlcy1jb25maWRlbmNlLXBsYW5lLW1hLTIwMTIwMzA0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"— When Airbus disclosed in January that it had discovered dozens of hairline cracks in a wing component of several of its A380 superjumbo jets, the news precipitated worrying headlines and digital missives that ricocheted online.

“Airbus A380 fleet should be grounded, say engineers,” the BBC reported on its website. “Airbus in damage control,” The Daily Telegraph of Australia announced. “Wing and a prayer?” The Associated Press wrote, unable to resist an ominous pun.

The fact that those cracks did not, in the view of aviation regulators or independent safety experts, pose an imminent safety risk was noted in most of those reports. But the impression of a potential emergency lingered.

Such problems are nothing new in aviation, industry executives said. With new planes — like the A380, which entered commercial service in 2007, or the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which carried its first passengers last year — the discovery of design weaknesses and performance issues is quite common early in the life of an aircraft.

What has changed is the availability of this type of information for a public that until quite recently heard about air safety only after a publicly reported safety lapse or, worse, a crash.

That may come as a small comfort to airline passengers, many of whom struggle to place in context dispatches on the latest possible problem with a plane they are about to ride. Yet industry executives, regulators and safety advocates emphasize that aircraft are more closely scrutinized today than ever before.

“Every aircraft that goes into service has something that crops up that’s unforeseen,” said Kevin Hiatt, chief operating officer of the Flight Safety Foundation in Alexandria, Va. “Every new airframe, or even an engine or a component, goes through a process of breaking itself in.”

It is an oversight process that still unfolds largely within the confines of maintenance hangars and test beds, involving teams of engineers, mechanics and designers who scour millions of hours of flight data in search of anomalies that might one day develop into a concern over performance or safety.

“No industry is more comprehensively overviewed as aviation,” said David Learmount, operations and safety editor at Flight International magazine. “That has been the case since the Second World War.”

Both Airbus and Boeing, which build the majority of the world’s large passenger planes, said they received tens of thousands of service messages each year from airlines, of which only a fraction were related to safety issues. In 2011, for example, Airbus recorded about 80,000 of these service events, like the discovery of the A380 wing bracket cracks and a landing-gear tire wearing out before it should have. Boeing, which did not provide data for any specific years, said it typically logged 100,000 to 200,000 such reports annually.

Most incidents are the result of actions by flight crews or maintenance staff and are unrelated to airworthiness, the companies and regulators said. But some do warrant deeper investigation. Airbus said that last year it identified about 1,700 such incidents, just over 2 percent of the total. Boeing said it classified about 2,000 events each year as “reportable” to regulators, equivalent to 1 percent to 2 percent of all occurrences.

More than 95 percent of these more significant issues are ultimately addressed with a proposed technical or procedural modification, which is communicated directly to the airlines and their maintenance providers, both Boeing and Airbus said. A full analysis of the problem is also provided to safety regulators, but it is still up to the airline to decide whether, and when, to make the recommended inspections or repairs.

Regulators step in to order remedial action only when a problem is identified that could create a safety issue if uncorrected. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, which oversees Boeing, and the European Aviation Safety Agency, which regulates Airbus, each company is subject to no more than about 100 such airworthiness directives across its fleet each year.

Every airworthiness directive, or AD in industry shorthand, includes a technical description of the problem and the required inspections or repairs. They are published on the regulators’ websites with specified deadlines for compliance that reflect the urgency of the safety risk: days, weeks, months or even several years.

“The AD process is helpful because it requires action by operators,” Corky Townsend, director of aviation safety at Boeing, said in an e-mailed response to questions. “Manufacturers can only ask and recommend that operators follow service bulletins, but regulators can compel action.”

A significant share of those directives tend to arise in the early part of an airplane’s 25-to 30-year average working life, safety experts said. Dominique Fouda, a spokesman for the European Aviation Safety Agency in Cologne, Germany, described a trend line that regulators say is consistent across many aircraft types and models, whereby the number of airworthiness directives climbs sharply over the first few years of service, then drops and plateaus for a decade or more. The airworthiness directives rise again in later years as wear and tear begin to take their toll.

“We have models that have proven to be extremely safe, like the Boeing 737 or the Airbus A320, that have flown hundreds of millions of hours without any major safety issues,” Fouda said. “However, those types received in their early days a similar or higher number of ADs at the same stage of their lifecycle than, for example, an A380.”

Since entering service five years ago, the Airbus A380, which has a current fleet of 69 planes, has been subject to 43 airworthiness directives, an average of nine per year. That includes one that followed the midair explosion in 2010 of one of its four engines during a Qantas Airways flight and prompted an emergency landing in Singapore. That failure was traced to a faulty component in the engine, which was built by Rolls-Royce of Britain.

By comparison, the fourengine Boeing 747 jumbo jet, with an active fleet of nearly 800 planes, has faced 840 airworthiness directives since it began flying passengers in 1969, averaging 21 per year.

Boeing’s 777 twin-engine, twin-aisle jet averages 18 directives annually. The Airbus A330, also with two engines and two aisles, has been the subject of 349 directives since 1994, or an average of 20 per year.

Analysts attributed the strong safety records of modern jets to major improvements in aerospace engineering over the past decade.

“Designs are getting better because of computer-aided design and manufacturing that enables engineers to calculate stresses before the first metal is cut,” said Learmount of Flight International. “When an airplane goes into service today, it has been more carefully trialed than in the old days. There are fewer potential unknowns.”"

Latest safety concern to hit world's largest passenger jet



Airbus' new A380 superjumbo has come under scrutiny over its safety record yet again - after Singapore Airlines had to shut down an engine mid-air and turn back three hours into a flight.



The double-decker plane, which was carrying 430 passengers to Frankfurt, Germany, yesterday was in the air for three hours when crew reported a surge in one of its four Rolls-Royce engines.



Pilots shut down the engine, turned flight SQ26 around and landed safely back in Singapore using the three other engines, the airline said.

Scrutiny: Airbus' new A380 superjumbo has come under fire again, after Singapore Airlines had to shut down an engine and return a flight to Singapore yesterday

The Airbus A380 is a superjumbo that took its first flight on April 2005. There are a total of 115 A380s in operation as of November 2013. It is a double decker jet with a wingspan of 79.75 metres

The passengers were transferred to another plane which later took off to Frankfurt.



'The aircraft is capable of flying safely on three engines and at no time was the safety of our customers and crew compromised,' Singapore Airlines said in a statement.



It did not specify the model of the engine involved, but the airline and Rolls-Royce said they would thoroughly inspect it and investigate what happened.

A Rolls-Royce spokesman said: 'We are aware of the situation and working with our customer to investigate.'



It is the latest safety incident to hit the world's biggest passenger plane, which cost a staggering £250million each.



Earlier this month Airbus said it would need years to get past problems with wing cracks, which were traced to a small component engineered in its design centre in Filton, Bristol.

Stretching out: There are just fourteen berths in the first class section of each A380. The plane can seat up to 853 passengers

The manufacturer was forced to order a global recall fix for the offending aluminium brackets which hold the wing’s skin to the structure, affecting the entire fleet of 69 planes currently flying.

The minor cracks - no more than two centimetres long - were discovered after Qantas ordered a fleet-wide inspection.

It came following the explosion of a Rolls-Royce engine during a flight over Indonesia in late 2010 and saw Australia's leading carrier grounding its superjumbo fleet for nearly a month.

Airbus feared the issue could cost it more than £80million in compensation, but insisted there was no threat to safety posed by the flaw.

It also added that safety agencies on both sides of the Atlantic had given the planes the all clear to continue flights.

But it said it would bring in the aircraft for the fix after about 1,300 flights when the enormous stress of thousands of hours of airtime start to exacerbate the problem.

It also said that these kind of problems were common in the first few years of a new aircraft, but they would eventually be ironed out.



The A380 made by Airbus, a unit of European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co.,was hailed as the next generation of planes which would save the longhaul flight industry.

It was designed to carry around 800 passengers more efficiently a cheaper than any aircraft ever before.

The A380 aircraft are in use by Qantas, Singapore Airlines, Emirates, Air France, Lufthansa, Korean Airlines and China Southern.

SIA, Singapore's flagship carrier, has 16 in service and three more scheduled for delivery this year. It was the first airline to take delivery, with the debut passenger flight taking place in October 2007.

The planes have been in service for five years. In total, 238 of the aircraft have been ordered by 17 airlines worldwide. British Airways is due to take delivery of 12 A380s next year, while the first of Virgin’s eight superjumbos will arrive in 2015.

Superjumbo services to Heathrow began in March 2008, with Manchester airport services starting in September 2010. Shares in Airbus parent EADS were up 0.3 per cent at 30.9550 euros at 0820am, while Rolls-Royce shares were 0.2 per cent higher.

787 Dreamliner vs A380: cockpit comparisons - Aerospace Technology,"Tue, 13 Mar 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm9zcGFjZS10ZWNobm9sb2d5LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9mZWF0dXJlZHJlYW1saW5lci12cy1hMzgwLWNvY2twaXQtY29tcGFyaXNvbnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The rivalry between Airbus and Boeing, the chief competitors for the passenger airline market, has only been exacerbated by the launch of their comparatively-sized new age airliners. Despite Boeing’s numerous problems in launching the Dreamliner, it has still gone toe-to-toe with Airbus’ A380 airliner at every turn, competing for orders across the globe.

While this competition has led to both aircraft being compared to each other in terms of passenger comfort, environmental and economical efficiency, little attention has been paid to the design features included by Boeing and Airbus for the benefit of those tasked with flying the aircraft.

With new technology, innovative designs and the return of favoured features, the cockpits and flight decks of the Dreamliner and A380 have been produced to make piloting passengers to their destinations as pain-free as possible.

A380 flight displays

The Airbus A380 cockpit has eight 15x20cm LCD displays



Perhaps the most noticeable innovation in the Airbus A380 cockpit has been the introduction of a total of eight 15x20cm interchangeable LCD displays. The system consists of two primary flight displays, two navigation displays, an engine parameter display, one system display and two multifunction displays which can be customised to cater for the pilot’s preference.

The eight-screen display replaces the previous method of using three multifunction control and display units, with the screens placed around the pilot’s eye line. Multifunction displays are of particular interest, as they play a vital role in hosting the information stored in the Network Systems Server, which stores all flight information.

Dreamliner flight displays and HUD

The Dreamliner cockpit uses primary flight displays and HUD displays

The Dreamliner cockpit displays information on primary flight displays located in front of the pilot, showing all necessary flight information and an artificial horizon to aid in pilot navigation.

The four-screen design provides 50% more display room than the five-screen design used on Boeing’s 777 aircraft. What sets the Dreamliner apart from rival airliners is the head-up displays (HUD), with one each for the pilot and captain.

The HUDs, retractable display units that can slide into the pilot’s eye line, provide flight data such as air speed, speed deviation and altitude for use by both pilots, and have become standard equipment aboard the Dreamliner.

Dreamliner controls: facing the familiar

The yoke controls of the Dreamliner (left) will be familiar to Boeing pilots

The controls aboard the Dreamliner are typically Boeing. The yokes are positioned front and centre for both the captain and first officer, designed to resemble the common cockpit layout for other Boeing aircraft. This has been an intentional design characteristic in order to increase pilot familiarity, allowing pilots to transition from previous Boeing-built aircraft and into the Dreamliner with a minimal amount of training.

As a result, experienced pilots tend to transition into the Dreamliner after days of training, rather than weeks.

With the aircraft on the ground, pilots can direct and steer the aircraft as it taxies using the tiller, which is located beside the pilot’s exterior leg (left for the captain, right for the first officer).

A380 controls: flying by wire

The Airbus A380 has adopted a fly-by-wire control system

In comparison, the A380 uses a fly-by-wire flight control system that is linked to side-sticks, located to the right or left of the pilot depending upon his position in the aircraft. This flight-envelope control system retains complete flight control, preventing pilots from flying outside of performance limits.

This has allowed Airbus to tailor computer flight control laws, greatly increasing flight safety and decreasing crew workload. The system was cited as a substantial help when a Qantas Airbus A380 suffered a major engine failure over the Philippines, forcing it to return to Singapore.

Controls on the centre console

The central consoles of the A380 cockpit (left) and Dreamliner (right)

The central consoles in both airliners are largely similar aside from a few unique features. The central consoles on-board both the A380 and the Dreamliner are largely dominated by the array of navigation and communication buttons, but differ due to the new addition of a keyboard control unit that comes in addition to the pull-out keyboard that sits in front of the pilot’s lap on the A380.

This keyboard control unit is used to manipulate the flight management system, bringing up a range of information on yet more screens that are situated to the side of the pilot’s knee.

Screens can show flight information or live video footage captured from cameras situated on both the nose and tail fin of the aircraft, depending on the pilot’s preference.

The power levers dominate the centre console aboard the Dreamliner, used to control the power to the engines despite the use of autothrottles dictating that a pilot could go through an entire flight without needing to touch them. Thrust reverse levers are situated just in front for use during the landing sequence, while the speed brakes are situated just to left, compiling all the necessary levers for the aircraft in one space.

New features for new pilots

One of the new features on the A380 is its entirely paperless cockpit, designed to reduce the amount of clutter contributed to by reams of flight maps, charts and technological manuals.

Related content Towards a paperless cockpit

Advances in portable computers and smart phones are making the concept of a ‘paperless’ cockpit more popular than ever.

Aboard the A380, all these documents have been replaced with the Network Systems Server, converting all necessary information into electronic documents that are aggregated into the server for instant access whenever they’re required.

The Network Systems Server connects to the multifunction displays, allowing either pilot to bring up information, such as navigation charts, equipment lists or performance calculations onto one of the displays, rather than sift through documents to find relevant information.

While retaining a substantial amount of commonality with previous Boeing-built flight decks, the Dreamliner does possess a number of characteristics that set it aside from its rivals. The Dreamliner’s four-screen display has resulted in 546 square inches of display space, twice as much as that of the 777.

One new feature that can make use of this increased screen space is the introduction of moving airport maps, consisting of detailed layouts of common airport destinations, allowing safer ground taxi operations. Pilots will also benefit from the maximum cabin pressure of just 6,000 feet, as opposed to the previous 8,000 feet, resulting in less fatigue during long haul flights.

Plane makers and bitter rivals Airbus of Europe, Boeing of the US and Embraer of Brazil announced on Thursday a joint plan to develop affordable biofuels for the airplane industry.

The airplane sector leaders agreed to seek opportunities ""to speak in unity"" to government and biofuel producers ""to support, promote and accelerate the availability of sustainable new jet fuel sources,"" a joint statement from the companies said.

The collaboration is intended to come up with a so-called ""drop in"" technology that all airplane models could use, regardless of the make.

Airbus and Boeing have already launched programmes independently to develop alternatives to kerosene, a major greenhouse gas pollutant, to power its airplanes.

""We are all committed to take a leading role in the development of technology programmes that will facilitate aviation biofuels development and actual application faster than if we were doing it independently,"" said Paulo César Silva, Embraer chief executive.

The planemakers said they were committed to reducing the industry's substantial carbon footprint, the term commonly used for emissions of greenhouse gases.

""We've achieved a lot in the last 10 years in reducing our industry's (carbon) CO2 footprint -- a 45 percent traffic growth with only three percent more fuel consumption,"" Airbus chief executive Tom Enders said.

Airbus on Wednesday announced a collaboration with airline Virgin Australia to explore biofuel production from eucalyptus leaves that grow in arid regions.

The company, which is part of the EADS conglomerate, has performed several test flights out of Al Dhafra airbase near Abu Dhabi with the UAE AF F-16 Block 60 and the Mirage 2000 fighters. The tests, which included aerial refueling during climbs, descents, turns as well as straight and level flight were performed at a range of altitudes and speeds.

Even if the F-16 has already been qualified to be refueled from the A330 tanker this was the first time a Block 60 with the large conformal fuel tanks and a slightly different wake footprint than the older version of the F-16, has taken on fuel. Tests have involved aircraft in various loadouts.

The same tests were also performed on the Mirage 2000, including the two seat version with different loadouts as well as different fuel loads.

During the refueling tests of the Mirage the two underwing refuelling pods were used both to refuel a single jet and two jets at the same time. The F-16, that in the past were tested with a removable IFR (In-Flight Refueling) probe to take fuel from a hose-and-drogue tanker, used the Air Refuelling Boom System (ARBS).

For those interested in tracking some air-to-air refueling flights, please consider that they often appear on both Planefinder and Flightradar24 since the A330 MRTT broadcasts full ADS-B data from its Mode-S transponder.

For instance, using the radio callsign “CASA 013” the A330 EC-339 could tracked on Mar. 20, 2012 performing a refueling mission between FL240 and FL280. Click here to see the route followed by the MRTT during that sortie.

Antonio Caramazana, Vice President Programme Director Airbus Military Derivatives, said: “It is very satisfying to qualify another two aircraft type as receivers for the A330 MRTT and we look forward to entry into service with the UAE Air Force later this year.”

The air crew training for the A330 with UAE pilots is currently taking place in Spain with the first two MRTT’s due to be delivered before the end of the year. The training of the aircrew takes place at Airbus’ training facility near Madrid and included not just the pilots but the refuelling operators too all using state of the art simulators.

The owner of the aircraft,Pitampura-based property dealer Rakesh Dikshit (40),says he had bought it as scrap in an Air India auction almost two months ago. The airplane,says Dikshit,cost him Rs 18 lakh.

The businessman has novel plans for his new purchase  he got the possession on Friday. A devotee of Shirdi Sai Baba,Dikshit wants to station the aircraft shell in Alipur and convert it into a museum of Shirdi Sai Baba.

What Dikshit did not factor in was the transportation of the airplane,whose wings and tail have been clipped off and seats and baggage space have been removed.

I dont know much about planes. This is the first I bought and its name is A-320. I was transporting it today in a big open truck,which has as many as 100 tyres. The trailer could not turn at the Alipur crossing,just before the Kondli border. So the traffic got stuck, Dikshit told Newsline over the phone.

He says he was then informed that he could not transport something so big before midnight.

The Delhi Traffic Police said the pile-up was reported around noon. This man was allegedly bringing the scrap plane from the airport and it got stuck at a turn just beyond the Palla Mor. He was prosecuted for dangerous driving and asked to resume transportation at a lean (traffic) period, said Satyendra Garg,Joint CP (Traffic).

DCP (Outer) B S Jaiswal told Newsline there was no law and order situation,only a lot of curiosity,which led to a long traffic jam.

The initial rumours were that a plane has crash landed in that area. People are just interested in looking at a plane,nothing else, said Jaiswal.

Till late evening,the aircraft was parked by the Alipur road.

Dikshit says he plans to have a museum as grand as the temple in Shirdi for Sai Baba. I will have idols,pictures,literature,utensils and all the things used by Sai Baba, he says.

the details. There is a Sai Baba temple in Alipur. The land is of Sai Baba Trust,and the trust is mine. Why should anyone stop me from keeping this plane,which I bought as scrap,on my own land? Or do what I wish to do with it? I have as much as 2,100 square yards to keep the plane and make my museum, he says.

An Air India spokesperson said auctions are held of aircraft older than 20 years and out-of-use. We auction parts that are of no use. If there is anything that can be taken out or used,it is. What is auctioned as scrap is just the outer shell, he said.

Another AI official said there are at least nine scrap aircraft of the airline at the hangers of IGI Airport. We give out two types of contracts  garbage and scrap. This was scrap, the official said."

Hopes up for Airbus C295 battlelifter for ADF - Australian Defence Magazine,"Fri, 09 Mar 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5kZWZlbmNlLmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzL2hvcGVzLXVwLWZvci1haXJidXMtYzI5NS1iYXR0bGVsaWZ0ZXItZm9yLWFkZi1wcmVtaXVt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Military has signed a firm contract with the Ministry of Defence of Kazakhstan, to supply two C295 military transport aircraft plus the related service support package for spare parts and ground support equipment.

The aircraft will be operated by the Kazakh Air Force in support of transport missions throughout the nation’s vast territory.

Additionally, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) has been signed for a further six C295 aircraft, for which separate firm contracts will be signed progressively over the next few years.

The first two aircraft will be delivered by April 2013 and for the remaining six aircraft a delivery schedule will be defined over the following years.

All of which brings us to Australia's own requirement for a battle lifter to replace the Caribou and improved prospects for the C-295 versus the Alenia C-27J – a mini-C130 which, due to its acquisition by the US military and thus the opportunity for interoperability support benefits, was preferred by the RAAF.

But US defence cuts have forced the early retirement of the C-27J fleet and thus raised concerns about long term support and the future availability of spares.

Indeed the head of Alenia is reported as saying the company would refuse to support the 21 C-27J aircraft that the US has bought so far (from an original 145 aircraft deal) if onsold to another country such as Australia, Canada or Taiwan.

Alenia has since released information to the effect that it would support an Australian C-27J regardless of the acquisition strategy the government pursues.

The Australian government announced last year that the C-27J was first choice because it could perform the Caribou role and was in US service.

But the head of Airbus Military's Australian program, Valentin Merino, says the claimed benefits of Australia buying the C-27J through FMS were fast disappearing with questions now over sustainment and supportability of the Australian fleet.

In a briefing to journalists this week, Airbus Military was keen to emphasise the importance of a competition that would generate tender quality data for the commonwealth to work from.

This would also give the C295 a chance to see if the carrying of a single G Wagon was really the priority concern cited by the RAAF.

Given that the new G Wagon is unable to be reversed into a C130J, let alone either a C295 or C-27J, thanks to the height of the new modules on the back, the company has questioned the doctrine behind such a consideration.

When would a single G Wagon be deployed?

Given the Air 8000 will be going to government for consideration in the coming months, we shall watch with baited breath to see what road government pursues."
IN FOCUS: Manufacturers aim for more comfortable cabin climate - Flightglobal,"Mon, 19 Mar 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vaW4tZm9jdXMtbWFudWZhY3R1cmVycy1haW0tZm9yLW1vcmUtY29tZm9ydGFibGUtY2FiaW4tY2xpbWF0ZS8xMDQ0MzEuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Higher cabin pressurisation and air humidification levels are heralded as major improvements in passenger comfort made possible by the shift from aluminium to carbonfibre airframes. Boeing and Airbus have different technological strategies to enhance the air quality on board the 787 and A350, but the jury is still out on which will be the more effective approach, and whether a better cabin climate really depends on the fuselage material.

Boeing decided to build the 787 largely from carbonfibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) because of the lighter weight and better fatigue behaviour of composite versus traditional metal. It is this latter point that allows higher fuselage pressurisation - and thus a lower cabin altitude - on regular flights.

Conventional aluminium aircraft can be inflated beyond their operational standards, but the greater structural strain will reduce their lifetime. For the 787, Boeing was able to lower the maximum cabin altitude from 8,000ft (2,440m) on previous models to 6,000ft.

© Boeing Boeing has installed an environmental control system on the 787 which should provide more even humidity levels

Airbus followed suit by launching the carbon composite A350 in 2006, also targeting a maximum cabin altitude of 6,000ft. The manufacturer had already lowered this ceiling on the A330, A340 and A380 to about 7,500ft, while the A320 family remained at 8,000ft. The upper limit is reached only when the aircraft flies at the maximum cruising altitude of 40,000ft and otherwise stays typically below 7,000ft, says Claire Nurcombe, aircraft interiors marketing manager at Airbus.

But more recent research has showed that lowering the cabin altitude from 8,000ft to 6,000ft will not significantly affect passenger comfort. The UK's Building Research Establishment (BRE) conducted a European-funded laboratory project with Airbus and other partners in 2009, in which a series of 8h flights were simulated with different pressure, temperature, noise and ventilation settings.

The Ideal Cabin Environment (ICE) project concluded that although there was ""evidence of combined effects of environmental parameters on subject health and comfort"", there was ""no consistent evidence of improvement to health and comfort from a decrease in the cabin equivalent altitude"". Different pressurisation levels indicated no significant impact on ""the development of venous thrombosis, inflammation, respiratory embarrassment or passenger distress"", the researchers added.

DEVELOPMENT CYCLES

""The development cycles for new aircraft are not always in line with the research cycles, which the European Commission is funding,"" says Nurcombe. ""The research came out after the decision had already been made to lower the cabin altitude on the A350."" But, given the fact that most of the world's population lives within a few hundred feet of mean sea level, she adds: ""Lower is always better.""

Blake Emery, director of differentiation strategy at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, says the US airframer observed a ""knee"" in the comfort level curve of its climatic chamber studies with the University of Oklahoma at around 6,000ft, above which symptoms such as headaches and muscular aches appeared.

However, the rate at which the cabin is pressurised appears to have a significant impact on passenger comfort. Nurcombe says this was not part of the ICE project, but Airbus undertook literature studies and then refined the software algorithms controlling the pressurisation systems. The result is that the cabin altitude changes more smoothly and at a different pace than the aircraft's climb or descent rate. If the aircraft climbs towards its cruising level, the pressurisation rate slows as the cabin nears its maximum altitude.

Nicolas Bonleux, executive vice-president of sales and marketing at air management system supplier Liebherr Aerospace, says the technical challenges are twofold: to design software that can calculate comfortable cabin altitude changes, and to develop the components with a quick reaction time.

Surprisingly, the ICE project found that neither ratings by the test participants - 1,400 people with varying health conditions - nor physiological markers showed a ""preference between relative humidity conditions"". The researchers trialled relative humidity levels of 10%, 25% and 40%, and a floating condition based on a constant moisture content.

MOISTURE LEVEL

But the airframers and humidification system manufacturers are sure cabin air moisture level has an impact on comfort and physiological wellbeing. Both Airbus and Boeing offer active, water-based air humidifiers for the flightdeck and crew rest compartments on the A350 and 787. The fact that most Dreamliner customers have selected this optional equipment for the cockpit - and so appear to think it will benefit pilots - proves there is a need for increased humidity, says Peter Landquist, vice-president sales and marketing at Swedish humidifier specialist CTT.

But it is a different story for the passenger cabin. On any aircraft without active humidifiers, the only source of moisture during cruise is the breathing and transpiration of passengers and crew and vaporisation from hot food and drinks, because at 40,000ft the outside air has a relative humidity of less than 1%.

Ironically, the air gets drier with increasing exclusivity because the moisture level depends on passenger density. Relative humidity in economy class is typically between 10% and 15%, but it can drop as low as 5% in premium accommodation, says Landquist.

This is why many widebody VIP aircraft have been equipped with active humidification systems. Relative humidity in natural environments depends on the geographical location and season, but typically varies between 15% in deserts to over 90% in tropical regions.

Boeing has installed an environmental control system on the 787 which manages the air recirculation and use of fresh air better than on other aircraft and maintains 10-15% humidity throughout the cabin, says Emery. He stresses that the system does not add moisture through active humidifiers.

Airbus offers such equipment as an option for first and business class on the A350. Landquist says this will raise humidity to 20% to 25% in those respective areas and could, via the recirculation of cabin air, lift moisture levels in economy class by 3% to 4%. But the water vapour needs to be captured by cabin air drying systems to prevent condensation in the aircraft structure and water accumulation in the insulation mats.

After developing a new-generation air humidifier for business jets about five years ago, Liebherr also wants to introduce the system to passenger airlines, both as OEM and retrofit equipment, says Bonleux.

Corrosion is quoted widely as a reason why humidifiers are not installed on metal aircraft, but this is not the main concern. All aircraft, whether made of aluminium or carbonfibre, suffer from condensation around the airframe structure. As the fuselage skin typically cools to about -25˚C during cruise, the ambient cabin air temperature falls below its dew point and condenses. Concorde was different in this respect because its skin heated up to an average of 90˚C due to air friction, which kept the supersonic jetliner dry.

So far, CTT has supplied zonal driers for about 450 (metal) passenger aircraft to avoid, at worst, ""rain in the plane"". Although the degree of condensation depends on operational circumstances, Landquist says it is not unusual for a narrowbody to accumulate 200kg (440lb) of water in its insulation material. Boeing installs two zonal driers on the 787 as standard equipment, and the A350 requires such a system because of its humidifiers.

Metal passenger aircraft can be fitted with humidifiers if requested by airlines. Apart from increasing complexity in the crown area above the cabin, which is tightly packed with air conditioning and passenger services systems, the problem with moisturisers is that they require water, which adds weight. Between 50 and 100 litres are typically required to humidify a widebody's premium accommodation on a 10-hour flight, says Nurcombe. ""The crucial issue for humidification systems is the extra weight of the water.""

Wing cracks in A380 superjumbos that sparked global recall blamed on British engineering firm - Daily Mail,"Fri, 02 Mar 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTIxMDkxNTAvV2luZy1jcmFja3MtQTM4MC1zdXBlcmp1bWJvcy1zcGFya2VkLWdsb2JhbC1yZWNhbGwtYmxhbWVkLUJyaXRpc2gtZW5naW5lZXJpbmctZmlybS5odG1s0gGMAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtMjEwOTE1MC9hbXAvV2luZy1jcmFja3MtQTM4MC1zdXBlcmp1bWJvcy1zcGFya2VkLWdsb2JhbC1yZWNhbGwtYmxhbWVkLUJyaXRpc2gtZW5naW5lZXJpbmctZmlybS5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Wing cracks in £250million A380 superjumbos that grounded entire fleet blamed on British engineering



All 69 A380s in service require overhaul to wings to fix faulty part

Airbus insists no threat to safety posed by cracks in UK-built and designed wings



A fault on the new A380 superjumbo which caused the grounding of every one of the jets has been blamed on British engineering.

Airbus has now traced the cause of small cracks developing on the wings of some of the £250million double-decker A380s to a small component engineered in its design centre in Filton, Bristol, it is understood.

The manufacturer has been forced to order a global reacall fix for the offending aluminium brackets which hold the wing’s skin to the structure. It will affect the entire fleet of 69 planes currently flying.

Discovery: Qantas discovered the wing cracks in the A380 after the compnay ordered a complete aircraft inspection following an engine blowout

The Airbus A380 is a superjumbo that took its first flight on April 2005. There are a total of 115 A380s in operation as of November 2013. It is a double decker jet with a wingspan of 79.75 metres

The news is a major blow to British industry.



The wings are the only part of the cutting-edge A380e which are built in the UK. Airbus employs 9,500 people in its Filton design centre and manufacting complex in Broughton, Wales.



The wings are then taken by sea to be assembled in Toulouse from parts built across Europe.

It is feared the issue could cost Airbus more than £80million in compensation.

A senior industry expert told The Times: ‘The issue is around the type of aluminum being used and the fitting which, as a result of the assembly, creates the crack’, with a source close to the problem adding, ‘It is a design and process engineering failure’.

The minor cracks - no more than two centimetres long - were discovered after Qantas ordered a fleet-wide inspection following the explosion of a Rolls-Royce engine during a flight, last year.

Airbus has insisted there is no threat to safety posed by the flaw and safety agencies on both sides of the Atlantic have given the planes the all clear to continue flights.

But Airbus is bringing in the aircraft for the fix after about 1,300 flights when the enormous stress of thousands of hours of airtime start to exacerbate the problem.

An Airbus spokesman told MailOnline: 'We are not commenting on individual sites and areas.



'Everyone in the company is absolutely focussed on resolving the issue.



'We are all one Airbus and the issue involves many parts of our global organisation.



'The issue is related to the material being used combined with the way parts are assembled on that specific area of the aircraft.'

The A380 made by Airbus, a unit of European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co.,was hailed as the next generation of planes which would save the longhaul flight industry.

It was designed to carry around 800 passengers more efficiently a cheaper than any aircraft ever before.

Industry experts say it is not unusual for new planes to develop unforeseen faults in the first few years of flight. These are normally quickly identified and ironed out.

The A380 aircraft are in use by Qantas, Singapore Airlines, Emirates, Air France, Lufthansa, Korean Airlines and China Southern.

The planes have been in service for five years. In total, 238 of the aircraft have been ordered by 17 airlines worldwide.

British Airways is due to take delivery of 12 A380s next year, while the first of Virgin’s eight superjumbos will arrive in 2015.

Singapore Airlines, one of the carriers that operates A380s in and out of Heathrow airport, was the first airline to take delivery of a superjumbo, with the debut passenger flight taking place in October 2007."
The best seats in Cathay Pacific premium economy (Airbus A330) - Executive Traveller,"Fri, 09 Mar 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vdGhlLWJlc3Qtc2VhdHMtaW4tY2F0aGF5LXBhY2lmaWMtcHJlbWl1bS1lY29ub215LWFpcmJ1cy1hMzMw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Cathay Pacific’s all-new premium economy seats strike a near-perfect balance between economy and business class.

Read our review to find our why, and then use this guide to choosing the very best seats for your journey.

The plane

Cathay Pacific is rolling out premium economy on all new Airbus A330-300 and Boeing 777-300ER aircraft, as well as retrofitting its existing fleet. All of Cathay's flights between Australia and Hong Kong take place on an Airbus A330.

Sydney is the first to see CX premium economy, on the daily CX100/101 Hong Kong service.

Melbourne and Adelaide will get the new premium economy seats from August, with Brisbane and Perth starting in October.

Cathay says that by December 2012, roughly three-quarter of all Australian flights will have the new seats on daily flights.

The premium economy cabin

Cathay Pacific’s premium economy class is sandwiched between business class and economy, from rows 30 through 33.

All four rows have seats in a 2-3-2 layout – the seat lettering is AB-DEG-HK (the photo above shows the 2-4-2 layout of Cathay's Boeing 777).

These premium economy seats can be booked for travel from April 1st 2012, with the price averaging about 50% above full economy fares.

However, through to March 30th, free premium economy upgrades will be offered to 'high-value frequent flyers’ from Cathay's Marco Polo program and oneworld partner airlines (including Qantas Frequent Flyer Platinum and Gold members) who happen to be travelling in economy on CX100 or CX101.

The best seats on the plane

Row 30: The front row once again comes up trumps for business travellers.

With around one metre of sheer legroom from the edge of the seat to the bulkhead wall, plus a built-in footrest, you won’t go wrong with seat in row 30 – even the middle seat 30E is bearable.

The only downside to this row is the location of bassinets at 30AB and 30HK.

But choosing a more rearward seat won’t make much different to the noise level of a screaming infant because the cabin is so small.

Rows 31 to 33 are much of a muchness, except that the closer you are to the rear of the cabin the closer you get to the bassinet positions at the start of economy.

If you prefer a window seat for the view then you’ll want 30A, 30K, 33A or 33K. Each of these boasts a window almost perfectly lined up with the seat: the others have their windows offset, so some craning of the neck is required.

The worst seats on the plane

Any of the ‘E’ seats: the centre seats in the middle block of three – is going to rob you of easy access to the aisle.

The least worst is 30E, in the frot row, because with such copious legroom you can easily step around your seatmates."

Under the agreement signed in France, KAI said in a statement it will exclusively produce wing bottom panels for the A320 passenger aircraft from 2014 to 2025.

KAI will supply the components for 500 A320s to be built each year, the company said, adding the deal may later be extended to 2030 at which point it will become worth more than $1.7 billion.

KAI, based in the southwestern city of Sacheon, has previously won orders to produce wing parts for the European firm's A350 and Boeing's B787 as well as for the A320.

The plan by Toulouse-based Airbus to shift some of its production from Wales to South Korea, first announced in January, drew fire from British unions which said the move would weaken Britain's aerospace industry.

Airbus said about 200 of the British workers affected by the shift would be retrained and redeployed."
US wants WTO to force end to EU's Airbus subsidies - SKNVibes.com,"Fri, 30 Mar 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMGh0dHA6Ly9tLnNrbnZpYmVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL25ld3NkZXRhaWxzLmNmbS81NTcwONIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Washington, USA) - The United States announced Friday it was asking the World Trade Organization to create a compliance panel to press the European Union to end subsidies to aircraft maker Airbus.

""In December 2011, the EU claimed to have removed the WTO inconsistencies, but provided no evidence to support its claims. However, the EU has not removed its WTO-inconsistent subsidies and has even provided new ones,"" the US trade representative's office said in a statement.

Ron Kirk, the US trade representative, said the EU's aircraft subsidies had cost American aerospace companies tens of billions of dollars in lost revenue, and workers their jobs.

""By taking this action today, we are reiterating the Obama administration's commitment to ensuring that every one of our trading partners plays by the rules, and that American companies can compete on a level playing field,"" Kirk said in the statement.

The US asked for a meeting of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body on April 13 to address the issue.

The US move ratcheted up the pressure in the seven-year-old trade dispute over public aid to France-based Airbus and US rival Boeing.

A parallel pair of subsidy complaints have been making their way through the WTO dispute process.

Friday's action came in response to a WTO ruling last June that found that the EU and four of its member states had provided more than $18 billion in subsidized financing to Airbus, the USTR noted.

The EU was given six months to comply with that ruling.

In December, the EU said it had complied but the US sought more information to verify the claim, holding consultations with the EU in January.

""The EU was unable or unwilling to substantiate its claims to have addressed the WTO inconsistencies, and the consultations failed to resolve the dispute,"" the statement said.

Kirk said the US remained ready ""to engage with the EU in any meaningful efforts that will lead to the goal of ending subsidized financing at the earliest possible date.""

The European Union expressed regret at Washington's move Friday, while alleging that the US itself has not reeled in its WTO-illegal support for Boeing.

""We regret that the US has chosen to take this step, since the EU notified its compliance with its WTO obligations in the package of steps taken at the end of 2011, and the US has yet to do the same in the Boeing case,"" said the European Commission's trade spokesman John Clancy."

The latest in AusBT's extensive series of guides to picking the best seat on the plane is here to help you get the most out of your journey.

The plane and cabin

Virgin Atlantic is one of your three premium economy options between Sydney and Hong Kong (and one of four, with British Airways added, on the overall Sydney-London route).

You'll find 38 premium economy seats on board in a 2-3-2 configuration, starting just in front of the wing of the stretched A340-600 plane.

Seats are among the widest in the premium economy band, at 21"" (53cm).

Each seat has an AC outlet but it's one of those oddly-shaped EmPower sockets so you'll want to be packing the right adaptor for your laptop or tablet.

The best seats on the plane

18A 18C 18H 18K: despite the seat map's layout, these are bulkhead seats with a wall in front (as shown below) rather than exit row seats you can really stretch out in.

That said, they're still the best on board. While you might be disturbed by a baby at the front of the cabin, it's not like the premium economy zone is really big enough for you to avoid that anyway.

18D 18F 18G: these centre three bulkhead seats are a decent deal since the middle seat can nip out without disturbing the aisle passengers.

The worst seats on the plane

23D 23G 22D 22C 22G 22H: these aisle seats right next to the lavatories are a definite no.

Rows 21-23: the rest of these three rows aren't quite as bad, but they're still further back in the cabin -- and thus closer to the relatively noisy loos.

F seats: skip the middle of the three seats if you can and go for an aisle instead."
Emirates boss has a crack at Airbus over A380 problems - Australian Aviation,"Fri, 09 Mar 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vYXVzdHJhbGlhbmF2aWF0aW9uLmNvbS5hdS8yMDEyLzAzL2VtaXJhdGVzLWJvc3MtaGFzLWEtY3JhY2stYXQtYWlyYnVzLW92ZXItYTM4MC1wcm9ibGVtcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Emirates Airlines President Tim Clark has lashed out at Airbus over its handling of A380 wing cracks, saying the airline will seek compensation for a claimed $90 million in lost revenues.

Emirates is having to temporarily ground six of its 21 A380s at a time while the wing cracks are fixed. Clark told the Financial Times that cracks have been found in 10 A380s so far and that all 21 are likely to need work.

Airbus says C-295 best choice for Aust - 9News,"Tue, 06 Mar 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LjluZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9uYXRpb25hbC9haXJidXMtc2F5cy1jLTI5NS1iZXN0LWNob2ljZS1mb3ItYXVzdC9iNmQ1ODIwNi02ZGVkLTQ4MTEtYTUxZS0xNDMyMGFmZjZjMDXSAUVodHRwczovL2FtcC45bmV3cy5jb20uYXUvYXJ0aWNsZS9iNmQ1ODIwNi02ZGVkLTQ4MTEtYTUxZS0xNDMyMGFmZjZjMDU?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Defence company Airbus Military says a US decision to phase out a fleet of C-27J Spartan aircraft makes its C-295 aircraft the best choice to replace Australia's new retired Caribou tactical transport aircraft.

Airbus Military Australian C-295 program head Valentin Merino said the claimed benefits of Australia buying C-27J through a US foreign military sale (FMS) deal - assured availability of spares and operational commonality - were disappearing.

""We say that needs to be taken into account in terms of what is the consequence for sustainment and supportability of the Australian fleet,"" he said.

Australia is looking to acquire up to 10 aircraft to fulfill the battlefield transport role performed by Caribou aircraft from 1964 until their final retirement in 2009.

Both the Airbus Military C-295 and Italian-designed Alenia C-27J are twin-engined medium transport aircraft. Last year the government announced C-27J was first choice on grounds that it could perform the Caribou role and, most importantly, was also in US service.

But in its major defence budget announcement at the end of January, the US revealed it planned to buy no more C-27J aircraft and sell off its current fleet.

Under the original deal the US was to buy up to 145 C-27J aircraft but that number has progressively dwindled to just 21 with 12 so far delivered.

In a further step, the head of Alenia revealed last week the company would refuse to support the 21 US aircraft if onsold to another country such as Australia, Canada or Taiwan.

""Clearly the US termination and disposal of its C-27J fleet is a game changer for Australia,"" Airbus said in a briefing to journalists in Canberra on Tuesday.

The company is calling for a level playing field in choice between C-295 and C-27J, suggesting that some claims of C-27J superiority could not be substantiated.

That includes the ability to carry the new Mercedes-Benz G-Wagon. This vehicle comes in various configurations and those with the larger load modules won't fit on either aircraft.

""We are not saying C-27J is rubbish. It is a good aircraft and it has capability over C-295 in selected areas, as does C-295 over C-27J, "" an Airbus spokesman said.

""We would rather the source selection not be predicated on fairly questionable capability requirements such as vehicles."""
"Govt to hurt more if Kingfisher shuts down - BusinessToday - Issue Date: Mar 18, 2012 - Business Today","Fri, 09 Mar 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzdG9kYXkuaW4vbWFnYXppbmUvZmVhdHVyZXMvc3Rvcnkva2luZ2Zpc2hlci1haXJsaW5lcy1jcmlzaXMtZ292ZXJubWVudC1hZmZlY3RlZC0yNzc5My0yMDEyLTAzLTA50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Banks effectively own 75% of the airline, and the impact on their books could be devastating if Kingfisher goes under

Employees are furious about not being paid, but say that everyone is not disheartened yet

When he finds time to speak to the media on board, as the champagne flows, he promises the moon. There will be non-stop flights between Bangalore and San Francisco, he says, and Kingfisher will be one of the world's top airlines. Forget Naresh Goyal, Mallya says he has Emirates, the Dubai airline, in the cross hairs.Perhaps the heady mix of champagne, the backing of politicians such as former civil aviation minister Praful Patel , businessmen buddies such as Gautam Singhania of the Raymond Group, and an army of yes-men in his company spurred him to target an airline known for its service and punctuality. Ironically, a few years later, Jet and Kingfisher flirted with each other, albeit unsuccessfully in the end.But at the time, passengers were having a blast. Kingfisher gave each passenger a complimentary kit - a pretty red plastic case containing headphones, a pen and other goodies. The food was excellent. The flight safety demonstration featured Czechborn model Yana Gupta and was shown on seat-back entertainment screens, which were a novelty at the time. Mallya assured passengers that he 'personally' hired the air-hostesses.Model Deepika Padukone, who was not as famous then as she is today, became the airline's brand ambassador. Her image was plastered on billboards across India. But Mallya's political friends could not always help him out Denied the opportunity to start international services before completing the mandatory five years of service, Mallya went hunting for another airline which had international flying rights. His bid to buy Air Sahara was thwarted by Goyal, who bought the carrier for Rs 1,450 crore in April 2007.In December 2007, Mallya turned his attention to Air Deccan, India's first low-cost carrier started by G.R. Gopinath in 2003.Deccan was bleeding money and on the verge of being bought by Anil Ambani , as Gopinath reveals in his autobiography. At the last minute, following an emotional phone call from Mallya to Gopinath - the latter later recalled that the conversation was in Kannada - Kingfisher bought Deccan, and eventually reversemerged itself with the low-cost carrier, acquiring its international rights.Mallya, who cut his teeth in the alcohol business, often likens himself to Richard Branson, the flamboyant owner of Virgin Atlantic. But, in the airline business, as one insider quipped: ""Branson uses flamboyance as a promotional tool; Mallya uses it as a management style.""Since Kingfisher began, three chief executives have come and gone, and the latest holder of the unenviable job, Sanjay Aggarwal, has reportedly found a way out as well.That Kingfisher Airlines was in trouble should have been evident to anyone who has looked at the airline's books: not a single profit-making quarter since inception, the debt burden rising year after year and annual interest payments topping Rs 1,100 crore in 2011.However, Mallya can hardly be accused of not being astute. Much of the airline is funded with bank loans totalling more than Rs 7,000 crore, even after a consortium of private and public sector banks converted Rs 750.09 crore of debt into a 23.37 per cent stake in the airline in mid-2011.With Mallya pledging more than 90 per cent of his 58 per cent stake in the airline, the banks effectively own over three-fourths of the carrier. With bad loans already rising, especially in the infrastructure sector, the impact on the banks' books would be devastating if Kingfisher were to go under. ""Forget bailing out Kingfisher, the banks are bailing themselves out,"" says a government official.The first sign of trouble for the airline came in mid-2008. The merged entity of Kingfisher and Deccan had become the largest Indian carrier with a 27.5 per cent share of the market, and passenger numbers were booming.Despite this, the airline did not take delivery of five Airbus A340-500 ultra long-range aircraft, even though domestic air travel was growing 30 per cent a year. The European manufacturer, left holding a billion dollars worth of aircraft, was livid. In fact, Kingfisher has more than 90 aircraft on Airbus' order books, but not one has been delivered to it since 2008.Kingfisher has said this was because the recession in the United States and rising fuel prices made non-stop flights unviable. But rival Jet Airways has enjoyed profits on its India-North America routes, and even loss-making state-owned carrier Air India makes money on non-stop services to New York and Chicago.""Kingfisher's problems are not external; they're internal,"" says Nikhil Vora, Managing Director, IDFC Securities. ""It is an extremely leveraged company, and the cost structure of the business itself is very high."" Neeraj Monga, Executive Vice President at Veritas Investment Research, whose report of September last year said both the airline and its parent UB Holdings were on the verge of bankruptcy, says the airline's strategy was flawed. ""The business plan was not well thought out,"" he says.{mosimage}""Kingfisher was to be a luxury airline in a country where price is the key characteristic."" Kingfisher's bet on a luxury model runs opposite to the lessons of low-cost carrier IndiGo and Jet Airways' move to increase low-cost offerings on domestic routes.On a recent flight between Delhi and Mumbai, passengers hooted when Mallya's welcome video came on. Entertainment screens do not work on many planes, and the food is abysmal. Many corporations have advised or ordered employees to avoid Kingfisher to avoid the perceived risk of delays and cancellations.Mallya has been blaming the media for giving his airline a bad name. In December, he stormed out of a press conference when asked uncomfortable questions. Other than the occasional moderated show on television, Mallya remains ensconced in his multi-million dollar home on Mumbai's Napean Sea Road."
