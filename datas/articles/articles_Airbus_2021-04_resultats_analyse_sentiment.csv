Luminar's LIDAR will take flight in new partnership with Airbus - The Verge,"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXZlcmdlLmNvbS8yMDIxLzQvMjYvMjIzOTkzODkvbHVtaW5hci1haXJidXMtbGlkYXItYXZpYXRpb24tZXZ0b2wtcGFydG5lcnNoaXDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Luminar, the newly public LIDAR company, is teaming up with the largest aircraft manufacturer in the world to bring its laser-guided mapping and perception technology to new heights.

LIDAR, the laser sensor that sends millions of laser points out per second and measures how long they take to bounce back, is seen as a key ingredient to autonomous driving. But it hasn’t seen as much traction in the world of aviation. Luminar and its new partner, the French aerospace giant Airbus, are out to fix that by applying the laser sensor’s 3D mapping capabilities to the aerospace company’s helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft in the hopes of making flying a lot safer.

“making overall transportation safe and autonomous”

Specifically, Luminar’s work with Airbus will fall under the aircraft manufacturer’s two innovation-focused projects: its UpNext subsidiary and FlightLab, which uses flight testing as the “principal means of achieving proof of concept for a variety of future technologies developed at Airbus.” Engineers from both companies will work together to “enhance sensing, perception, and system-level capabilities to ultimately enable safe, autonomous flight,” the companies said.

This will be Luminar’s first foray into anything outside the world of autonomous vehicles, Austin Russell, the founder and CEO of Luminar, told The Verge. Russell said he sees linking up with Airbus as an extension of his mission of “making overall transportation safe and autonomous — it’s the same exact story.”

While the number of airplanes that crash every year has been steadily dropping, helicopter crashes — like the one that killed NBA star Kobe Bryant in 2020 — are becoming more common. The rate of fatal helicopter accidents per 100,000 flight hours jumped from 2016 to 2018, according to data released in March 2019 by the US Helicopter Safety Team, a volunteer team of government and industry leaders. The number of fatalities per 100,000 hours also rose.

Russell is convinced that Luminar can help prevent some of those fatal crashes. “A double-digit percentage of helicopter crashes happen by just landing on things like wires that are totally avoidable,” he said. “If you can actually just have a 3D map and see what’s going on hidden underneath you would be an improvement. Even some of the best pilots have a hard time being able to see these kinds of things.”

Luminar was founded by a then 17-year-old Russell in 2012 and counts among its backers Peter Thiel and Volvo, which will begin using Luminar technology to power autonomous driving in its cars beginning in 2022. Luminar also supplies Audi and the Toyota Research Institute, and it has announced partnerships with Mobileye and Daimler’s trucking division.

In addition to making giant passenger planes, Airbus also has an interest in small, battery-powered air taxis that are commonly referred to as “urban air mobility.” These would essentially be small helicopters with electric powertrains that could be used for short-hop flights within cities, such as Manhattan to JFK airport.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9778251051902771}",neutral,0.9778251051902771,0

The third and final Airbus H135 helicopter has arrived at the Launch and Landing Facility at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, completing the upgraded fleet of aircraft used for security operations at the Florida spaceport. This one arrived March 11, 2021, joining the two other H135 helicopters, which arrived in September 2020. Coming from Columbus, Mississippi, the Airbus helicopters replace the Bell Huey 2 aircraft that had been in service at Kennedy for the last 30 years. Maintained by the center’s Flight Operations team, the Airbus H135 helicopters provide expanded medical and security capabilities while improving the team’s ability to safely perform operations.

One of the biggest differences between the H135s and the older, single-engine aircraft is that the Airbus helicopters have two engines. This allows teams to fly further offshore when providing launch support. Additional improvements include built-in mounts for medical equipment, upgraded camera systems, quieter and more stable camera platforms, and the ability to transport injured personnel, if necessary, during inclement weather.

"Airbus’ Move To Reintegrate, Centralize May Have Far-Reaching Effects - Aviation Week","Mon, 26 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9hZXJvc3BhY2UvYWlyY3JhZnQtcHJvcHVsc2lvbi9haXJidXMtbW92ZS1yZWludGVncmF0ZS1jZW50cmFsaXplLW1heS1oYXZlLWZhci1yZWFjaGluZy1lZmZlY3Rz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus formalized some pretty significant changes to its senior leadership in mid-April: Dirk Hoke, the CEO of Airbus Defense and Space, confirmed his departure later this summer, as did Grazia Vittadini, the charismatic and popular chief technology officer. In addition, the influential chief operating officer (COO) position will soon be held by Alberto Gutierrez, while incumbent COO Michael Schoellhorn will replace Hoke. Two weeks later, CEO Guillaume Faury announced more changes, this time to the industrial setup, fostering deeper integration of aerostructures manufacturing.

Airbus creates large aerostructures subsidiaries

Detailed parts production will be spun off as non-core

On the surface, the staff moves and industrial reorganization may not appear to have much in common. But a theme is emerging more clearly of late, two years after Faury moved into the Airbus CEO role: Centralization and integration are being reinforced and will be managed by a team of executives particularly loyal to Faury. Hoke has long had ambitions to become CEO, hopes that were dashed when the board opted for Faury. Vittadini, who has also not been part of Faury’s inner circle, sometimes clashed with Jean-Brice Dumont, Airbus head of engineering and a close associate of Faury. The appointment of Gutierrez, who has so far not been in the top tier of Airbus executives, shows that politics and tactics continue to play a role behind the scenes.

The latest action concerns a part of Airbus’ complex industrial setup. Faury is proceeding with his plans to reintegrate a large part of the aerostructures work into the core Airbus business while also carving out a detailed parts company that could be sold later. The plans are subject to negotiations with unions, which were briefed in more detail on April 21, which means there could still be changes to the setup—though the decision itself is not in doubt.

Management concluded that most of what aerostructures subsidiaries Premium Aerotec and Stelia Aerospace do is so core to Airbus and its future that they should not be sold. Faury argues that Airbus’ move into the digital design, manufacturing and services (DDMS) strategy, which integrates the three phases digitally, makes it necessary to keep tight control over a broader part of the design and manufacturing process—even of larger components that Boeing is happy to source from suppliers, such as 737 fuselages produced by Spirit AeroSystems. DDMS is the basis upon which Airbus plans to develop all future generations of aircraft. And while Airbus is unlikely to launch any new programs before its planned move into the next generation of hydrogen-powered aircraft slated for entry into service by 2035, DDMS will be used to build derivative aircraft such as a possible A322 (a stretched, rewinged and reengined version of the A321neo) or a freighter version of the A350.

The move, to be implemented at the beginning of 2022, would reverse an earlier 2009 decision to set up two aerostructures companies in France and Germany, Aerolia and Premium Aerotec. Aerolia later merged with Sogerma, another subsidiary, and was renamed Stelia Aerospace. Under the previous management team led by former CEO Tom Enders, Airbus had hoped to sell both Aerolia and Premium Aerotec—much like Boeing sold Spirit AeroSystems. But the sales never happened, in part because demand dropped in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.

Premium Aerotec is based in Augsburg, Germany, and has additional factories in Varel and Nordenham. Stelia Aerospace mainly comprises aerostructures facilities in Meaulte and Saint-Nazaire in France. Both companies build subassemblies up to fuselage sections across the range of Airbus products and divisions.

The latest plans call for the creation of three new companies. One would be based in France and combine the current Stelia businesses with Airbus sites in Saint-Nazaire and Nantes, France. That entity would produce, among other things, the nose fuselage and center wingboxes for all Airbus programs, the forward fuselage of the A320 and the central fuselage of the A330 and A350. It would have 12,000 employees at 16 sites.

Another new company is to be created in Germany. It would bring together all German Premium Aerotec facilities—except Augsburg’s Plant 4 and the company’s facilities in Varel—with Airbus’ site in Stade and its structural assembly in Hamburg. The new enterprise would build the forward fuselage of the A330 and A350, the center fuselage of the A320 as well as the rear fuselage and tail cone for all programs. The company is planned to employ 7,000 people in five locations.

These two firms would no longer be considered suppliers to Airbus but instead would be integrated into the Airbus production system and flow. That said, they would remain distinct, separate entities.

The third company would be focused on detailed parts and have an estimated €900 million ($1.1 billion) in annual sales. It would combine the Premium Aerotec sites in Varel with Plant 4 in Augsburg and a facility in Brasov, Romania. Airbus says it is “reviewing different ownership structures to identify the best possible solution” for the parts business. The company believes it can create a strong global player in the detailed parts industry that would be sustainable and competitive with “an appropriate investment strategy.” The newly formed venture could count on a “long-term growth perspective” with Airbus as major customer, the OEM says, but also may work with external clients on civil and defense products.

The company would produce machined, milled and turned parts and have capabilities in metallic and nonmetal components.

The changes identify Airbus’ red line as to what work it is prepared to leave to suppliers and indicate that detailed parts production is not something the manufacturer considers vital in-house work. What they do not address is whether the company’s complex industrial footprint needs a revamp. While no changes are expected—or even possible—in the short term, questions loom on the horizon. The role of Airbus’ plant in Bremen, Germany, has been debated internally for some time, but Faury has not addressed it yet. Airbus also needs to attend to the post-Brexit future of its UK sites at some point, though major changes are only likely when workshares of new aircraft programs need to be decided.

More important than the unlikely prospect of rationalizing its industrial presence across Europe is a side effect of the reshuffling: the strengthening of Airbus’ in-house aerostructures capabilities. Airbus could take on more work itself, and that is a threat for suppliers. According to industry sources, the message from Airbus has already been received by some suppliers that may be directly affected in the not-too-distant future and others that are starting to worry about what the moves could mean for them further down the road.

Two companies that probably have more reason for concern than others are Spirit AeroSystems and Leonardo. Spirit is building the composite center fuselage section of the A350 and the A220 wings, among other things. Leonardo is building the horizontal and vertical stabilizer for the A220. Airbus was about to start renegotiating terms with the A220 suppliers when the novel coronavirus pandemic hit and suppressed production rates. Airbus aimed at significantly better conditions than the A220’s previous owner, Bombardier Aerospace, could reach. Similarly, the A350 is still facing cost pressure, which has only become worse as rates fell to less than five aircraft per month from 10.

According to the industry sources, Airbus has made clear it expects new agreements with its key suppliers in both programs—not just the A220. At the same time, the company has invested massively in new production technology at Augsburg and Nordenham for the A350, infrastructure that is now underutilized.

In the near term, Airbus’ site in Cadiz, Spain, is in focus and that is where the Gutierrez appointment comes into play. The restructuring plan for the Puerto Real plant in Cadiz has been hit hard by the termination of the A380 program and the slowdown of other widebody programs, threatening around 300 jobs there. Airbus “continues to work with the social partners to identify solutions that will optimize the industrial setup,” the company says. Given that Spain has always felt overshadowed in its Airbus role by the much bigger French and German presences, any move is certain to face massive political backlash, even though Cadiz is such a small site.

The topic of facing backlash is something Faury has to keep in mind. Making Airbus a bigger, more centralized entity that covers more of the supply chain also increases risk when things go wrong. For the company, it means tight control over processes is needed. For Faury, who now has upped the game personally, it means he needs to deliver.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999271631240845}",neutral,0.9999271631240845,0

Exclusive: Airbus floats concept for A380 freighter conversion - FreightWaves,"Mon, 05 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWlnaHR3YXZlcy5jb20vbmV3cy9leGNsdXNpdmUtYWlyYnVzLWZsb2F0cy1jb25jZXB0LWZvci1hMzgwLWZyZWlnaHRlci1jb252ZXJzaW9u0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnJlaWdodHdhdmVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2V4Y2x1c2l2ZS1haXJidXMtZmxvYXRzLWNvbmNlcHQtZm9yLWEzODAtZnJlaWdodGVyLWNvbnZlcnNpb24vYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is polling airlines that fly the massive double-decker A380 for interest in converting the out-of-favor plane into a freighter, while keeping the top level for passengers, to take advantage of demand for e-commerce shipping, according to sources with direct knowledge of the matter.

The trial balloon is a reflection of how far the super-jumbo’s stock has fallen as a people mover and the industry’s thinking that passenger traffic isn’t going to come back enough after the pandemic to support what once was the manufacturer’s crown jewel.

Developing a hybrid cargo jet with passengers on the upper deck also underscores the A380’s limitations as a pure freighter and that dual revenue sources are needed to make the business case work. Analysts expressed skepticism that Airbus (DXE: AIR) can pull off the project because a freighter conversion would be costly to engineer and uncompetitive with other all-cargo aircraft.

“We are always looking into advancing our products, keeping them at the leading edge of technology. We are in constant dialogue with our customers about the latest state-of-the-art technologies and ongoing innovations,” Airbus spokesman Bart Greer told FreightWaves in an email, adding that a passenger-to-freighter conversion of the A380 would be technically feasible.

“If we see sufficient customer interest in an A380 converted freighter, we would investigate this possibility further,” he said.

A source within the Airbus corporate family, who asked not to be named, confirmed the airframer is shopping around the conversion concept. Another person, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said two airlines privately confirmed they have been approached about the matter.

An A380 converted freighter has merit, but only if there is significant interest to recover the non-recurring development, testing and certification costs associated with a major alteration, said Stan Wraight, co-founder and president of Strategic Aviation Solutions International, an aviation consultancy.

“They better get 50 or 60 orders to make that work,” he said.





Meanwhile, Reuters recently reported that Airbus is also testing the waters for a freighter version of the A350 passenger jet.

Unmet Expectations

Cargo could give the A380 a new lease on life. Otherwise, it is going to end up stored in the desert, stripped for parts or scrapped, aviation experts say.

The pandemic was the last nail in the coffin for the sky bus that never met expectations. In 2019, Airbus announced it would stop producing the A380 and in March the last one left the assembly plant in Toulouse, France. Only 251 A380s will be delivered compared to original market forecasts of more than 500; the earliest versions are just 14 years old.

The four-engine behemoth was designed for high-density passenger markets. But soon after development, it was eclipsed by Boeing’s efficient, long-range twin-engine 787 with high-tech composite materials that tapped into consumer preference for direct flights rather than connecting through major hubs. Airline executives were also focused on the environmental benefits of powering aircraft with fewer engines, so Airbus shifted resources to the A350.

The 787 Dreamliner and the 777-300 Extended Range have passenger yields that rival the A380’s with significantly lower trip costs, according to analysts.

When passenger travel plunged with the pandemic, Air France-KLM retired its fleet of A380s in favor of more fuel-efficient and modern aircraft. Lufthansa (DXE: LHA) did the same with six of its planes, and another eight are expected to be mothballed. The carrier last year said the aircraft would only be reactivated in the event of an unexpectedly rapid market recovery.

Last month, CEO Tony Douglas said Etihad Airways likely won’t bring back the giant planes. Instead, the state-owned carrier will downsize and focus on smaller aircraft such as the 787.





Thai Airways recently solicited interest from potential buyers for two of its A380s.

“The way the values of those aircraft have dropped, I mean they’re almost worthless,” Phil Seymour, president of London-based IBA Group and veteran aircraft appraiser, said in an interview.

As of late January, only China Southern, Emirates and Korean Air were operating A380s, according to Simple Flying. British Airways, which has 12 of the aircraft in storage, plans to return them to service, CEO Sean Doyle recently said at a conference. The airline, however, did retire its entire fleet of 31 Boeing 747-400 jumbo jets last summer.

Despite its enormous size, the A380 was never prized for cargo transport because so much space is devoted to passengers and baggage. Fully loaded, it holds 20% to 60% less cargo than other widebody jets. Depending on passenger loads, cargo often is offloaded at the last minute, making the plane unreliable for shippers. And the extra passenger weight further restricts cargo on ultra-long flights.

Pound for pound, logistics professionals say the Boeing 777 is the best long-haul cargo jet, both as a pure freighter and passenger jet with lots of belly capacity.

The ‘combi’

Airbus, which is part of a joint venture that does modification work, is offering a combination aircraft in an apparent effort to help customers that are stuck with the aircraft. The A380’s limitations, including potential restrictions on container size even after retrofitting, means the only addressable market is existing customers because the plane still needs passenger revenue to make the economics work.

The airfreight market has been booming since last summer. With passenger airlines operating a fraction of their fleets, capacity has not kept up with extremely strong cross-border trade fueled by manufacturing and e-commerce activity.

Air cargo rates on key routes are four to five times more than normal for this time of year. Airlines have taken advantage of high yields by operating dedicated cargo service with passenger aircraft.

Freighter conversions typically occur when aircraft come to the end of their useful life serving passengers. They allow owners to extend the timeline for depreciation and achieve greater investment returns. Airlines can sell the planes into the secondary market. The buyers, or leasing companies repurposing the aircraft, send them to specialized maintenance shops to gut and cut the airframe.

But so-called “combis” have a checkered history.

KLM, which is the only mainstream carrier to have made money with the unique aircraft, recently got rid of its last 747-400 combi. Today, the dual-use planes are mostly used to serve remote areas because they allow airlines to split flights with freight and people for locations where there isn’t huge demand for either. Experts say they are difficult to manage because airlines are trying to serve two markets at the same time, often requiring them to make operational compromises and comply with increasingly stringent fire safety standards.

In a typical “combi” configuration, cargo and people coexist on the main deck, divided by a reinforced bulkhead. Airbus is floating a concept in which the main deck would be restructured for cargo and the smaller upper cabin would remain for passengers.

One reason for such a configuration is that the ceiling of the A380’s main deck may not be high enough to fit 10-foot pallets, said Steve Fortune, who heads investment consulting firm Fortune Aviation Services. The floor height of the passenger aircraft was different than what FedEx (NYSE: FDX) needed before Airbus canceled plans in 2007 to build a freighter version over concerns about sales and different engineering requirements.

Fortune, who worked in FedEx management at the time, said he assumes if the deck height was an issue, then it could still be one for an all-cargo airline.

The aircraft’s two-story design renders conversion impractical, other analysts agree.

“We do not believe that a passenger-to-freighter conversion of the A380 would be viable, especially given the high empty weight of the aircraft relative to its potential freight payload,” said Chris Seymour, head of market analysis at Ascend, the consulting arm of aviation data provider Cirium. “Specifically, the passenger design and location of the upper deck are not optimal for cargo use and the aircraft would be relatively compromised in the context of payload, with significant volume but with potential weight restrictions.”

Target audience

The Airbus likely will target its pitch to major A380 operators such as Emirates. Those with only a few aircraft will simply write off the assets, a source familiar with the situation said.

Emirates has 103 A380s in its fleet. In November, it began flying the super-jumbo jet in cargo-only operations, sometimes with cargo in the seats, a tactic many passenger airlines employed during the past year to take advantage of the red-hot cargo market. The company said it can carry about 50 tons of cargo in the belly.

Emirates also has a fleet of 11 Boeing 777 pure freighter aircraft, as well as 16 modified 777-300s with seats removed to temporarily increase capacity while cargo business is up and passenger is down.

An Emirates spokesperson was noncommittal about a converted freighter, but said the Skycargo division is “well positioned to meet global air cargo demand with our current fleet mix.” She noted that as a mini-freighter, the A380 has the ability to safely transport larger quantities of dry ice, which allows more temperature-sensitive cargo such as COVID vaccines to be transported.

“We do not see any feasible deployment scenario for an A380 passenger-to-freighter conversion,” Lufthansa spokesman Andreas Pauker said.

“Singapore Airlines remains committed to the A380 passenger aircraft and will have 12 aircraft in our fleet as we recover from COVID-19,” a spokesperson said without making reference to the cargo configuration.

IBA’s Seymour said retrofitting the main deck of the A380 for cargo while maintaining access stairs to the upper deck could pose an engineering challenge for smoke and flame suppression because the ventilation systems need to be isolated.

“It’s not really a case of putting up a partition and few fire extinguishers. The whole air conditioning infrastructure needs to change as well,” he said in an interview.

Developing a freighter conversion program takes years. Fortune estimated Airbus would have to invest about $100 million to design a modification and installation kit, not including production costs.

“The A380 aircraft is, therefore, likely to be uncompetitive against other converted aircraft types such as the 777-300 Extended Range, 767 and the Airbus A330,” Seymour said. Israel Aircraft Industries last year launched a 777 conversion program and will charge about $30 million per unit, FreightWaves has learned. Airbus would need to similarly price the A380 makeover to make it reasonably competitive, Seymour added.

One factor that might work in the A380’s favor as a combination freighter is that the massive shift to e-commerce means more light boxes are being shipped today than ever, with planes often filling up before they hit the maximum payload weight.

Airbus to test advanced autonomous features on helicopter Flightlab - Airbus,"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0wNC1haXJidXMtdG8tdGVzdC1hZHZhbmNlZC1hdXRvbm9tb3VzLWZlYXR1cmVzLW9uLWhlbGljb3B0ZXItZmxpZ2h0bGFi0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Marignane, 26 April 2021 – Airbus is introducing autonomous features to its helicopter Flightlab through a project code-named Vertex. These technologies aim to simplify mission preparation and management, reduce helicopter pilot workload, and further increase safety.

The autonomous technology bricks set to integrate the Flightlab are: vision based sensors and algorithms for situational awareness and obstacle detection; fly-by-wire for enhanced auto-pilot; and an advanced human-machine-interface - in the form of a touchscreen and head worn display for inflight monitoring and control.

The combination of these technologies will enable a system that can manage navigation and route preparation, automatic take-off and landing, as well as following a predefined flight path. The incremental integration of these technologies onto the helicopter Flightlab has begun ahead of a complete demonstration in 2023. Airbus’ Urban Air Mobility will also benefit from this technology as an essential stepping stone towards autonomous flight.

“We are excited by the potential that the Vertex demonstrator project has to offer,” said Grazia Vittadini, Chief Technology Officer, Airbus. “By using our platform-agnostic flying laboratory to mature these technologies, we have an agile and efficient test bed that will support the development of future autonomous systems that could later equip Airbus’ current helicopter range and (e)VTOL platforms.”

Airbus’ mission is not to move ahead with autonomy as a target in itself, but to explore autonomous technologies alongside other technological innovations. In doing so, Airbus is able to analyse the potential to enhance future operations, and at the same time, leverage these opportunities to further improve aircraft safety.

Vertex is managed by Airbus UpNext, an Airbus subsidiary created to give future technologies a development fast-track by building demonstrators at speed and scale, evaluating, maturing and validating new products and services that encompass radical technological breakthroughs.

Since then, other cutting-edge materials have improved aircraft design, from metals (titanium, steel, new AI alloys) to composites (carbon and glass fibre, polymeric and epoxy resins).

Today, a new class of highly performant materials—bio-composites—is emerging to offer even more exciting possibilities for improved environmental performance as engineers aim to unlock their potential for use in future aircraft.

Increasingly used in industrial applications due to their numerous advantages, bio-composites are lightweight, flexible, cost-effective, and recyclable.

Bio-composites: lightweight and recyclable

Bio-sourced composite materials are formed—like today’s composites—by a matrix (resin) and a fibre, but of biological origin. Increasingly used in industrial applications due to their numerous advantages, they are lightweight, flexible, cost-effective and recyclable.

The raw materials for bio-composites are derived from natural renewable resources: biomass, plants, crops, micro-organisms, animals, minerals and bio-wastes. Chemical and/or mechanical conversion is required to transform these raw materials into bio-composites, which can be used alone or in complement to standard materials, such as carbon and/or glass fibre.

Today, bio-composites can be composed of one or several of the following components:

Natural fibres : These fibres can be obtained from animals, plants or minerals. They do not require a carbonisation process (i.e. the conversion of an organic substance into carbon or a carbon-containing residue).

Biomass carbon fibres : Biomass (i.e. algae, cellulose, lignin) is used to create feedstock and raw materials for further transformation into fibres and resins.

Bio-resins: Resins are highly viscous substances that are converted into polymers (i.e. materials). Bio-resins are made of biological origin, derived mostly from plant oils, biomass or bio-wastes.

In the aerospace industry, bio-composites could be applied in the following areas:

Cabin and cargo : These applications require advanced properties relating to Flammability, Smoke Density and Toxicity (FST) and heat release.

: These applications require advanced properties relating to Flammability, Smoke Density and Toxicity (FST) and heat release. Primary and secondary structures : These applications involve high structural loads and thus require improved mechanical performance and durability.

: These applications involve high structural loads and thus require improved mechanical performance and durability. Auxiliary materials: These applications require functionality for non-flying materials or any means used for the production of composite components in industrial plants.

A look at raw materials in bio-composites

Sugar cane waste, also known as “bagasse,” is a dry, pulpy material that remains after extracting juice from sugar cane stalks. Because sugar cane is widely available and a highly efficient converter of solar energy, it is capable of yielding large volumes of biomass.

Sugar cane waste is an excellent source of cellulose fibres, which can be used as “filler” in bio-composites. It can also be used in bio-based Furan resins, which are obtained by chemical conversion or bio-refinery. Furan bio-polymers, in combination with suitable natural or recycled fibres (e.g. recycled carbon fibre), could be used for aircraft interiors.

From microscopic species to large seaweeds, water algae are simple photosynthetic organisms capable of binding CO2 from the atmosphere and transferring it to biomass.

Water algae, like other biomass, could be used as a carbon feedstock to replicate the monomers used to produce today’s carbon fibre precursors or resins in standard composites. This approach could thus enable bio-composites to offer the same mechanical properties as existing composites for aircraft applications.

Basalt fibres are made of volcanic rock, mainly found in the lunar maria on Earth’s Moon. Non-hazardous with excellent shock and fire resistance, basalt fibres have similar mechanical properties to glass fibres, but with the advantage of a simpler manufacturing process due to their less-complex composition.

Fibres produced directly from lunar rocks could be used for a variety of purposes. This includes stabilising the 3D-printed structure of the lunar station, generating thermal insulation, improving filter systems and providing textiles for astronaut suits.

Lightweight, fast-growing and highly elastic, bamboo is a natural composite material composed of cellulose fibres embedded in a lignin matrix.

Natural bamboo fibres combined with bio-based or standard resins could deliver many benefits. These include reducing environmental impact and improving mechanical performance.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9560152292251587}",positive,0.9560152292251587,1
Airbus to transform its European set-up in aerostructures - Airbus,"Wed, 21 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0wNC1haXJidXMtdG8tdHJhbnNmb3JtLWl0cy1ldXJvcGVhbi1zZXQtdXAtaW4tYWVyb3N0cnVjdHVyZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"● Plans to create new aerostructures companies in France and Germany



● Discussions ongoing regarding industrial set-up in Spain

Toulouse, 21 April 2021 – Airbus has provided more details to its social partners during a European Works Council (SE-WC) meeting about the Company’s ongoing assessment of its industrial set-up in Europe, notably regarding aerostructures activities in France and Germany.

Airbus has reaffirmed its intention to build a stronger aerostructures assembly value chain across its industrial system to its social partners, and considers aerostructures assembly as core to its business. Airbus presented its plans to create two integrated aerostructures assembly companies at the heart of its industrial system in order to reinforce its value stream management and prepare the Company for its short- and long-term future.

As part of these plans, and upon successful completion of the ongoing social process, the new company in France would bring together the activities currently managed within Airbus in Saint-Nazaire and Nantes together with those of STELIA Aerospace worldwide. Another company in Germany would bring the activities of Stade and Structure Assembly of Hamburg together with those of Premium AEROTEC in Nordenham, Bremen and partly in Augsburg, while rebalancing activities towards the upper part of the value chain and reviewing its involvement in the manufacturing of detail parts.

These two new aerostructures assembly companies, both wholly owned by Airbus, would no longer be suppliers to Airbus but become integrated within the Airbus perimeter, simplifying both governance and interfaces in a new industrial setup. Their distinct status would also enable them to focus on their industry segment and be leaner and more agile,fostering competitiveness, innovation and quality to the benefit of the Airbus programmes of today and tomorrow.

Airbus also intends to create a new global player in the detail parts business, anchored in Germany. Born out of today’s Premium AEROTEC, this new entity, with its scale and advanced technologies, would be empowered to capitalise on the significant long-term growth prospects with Airbus as well as external customers, on both civil and military platforms.

In Spain, Airbus continues to work on solutions with its social partners to optimise the current industrial and aerostructures set-up in the Cádiz area in order to ensure its viability, resilience and competitiveness for the future.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5399906635284424}",neutral,0.5399906635284424,0
Airbus and TNO to develop aircraft laser communication terminal - Airbus,"Thu, 08 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0wNC1haXJidXMtYW5kLXRuby10by1kZXZlbG9wLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWxhc2VyLWNvbW11bmljYXRpb24tdGVybWluYWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Munich, 8 April 2021 – Airbus and the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) have launched a programme to develop a laser communication terminal demonstrator for aircraft, known as UltraAir.

The project, which is co-financed by Airbus, TNO and the Netherlands Space Office (NSO), is part of the European Space Agency’s (ESA) ScyLight (Secure and Laser communication technology) programme. It covers the design, construction and testing of the technology demonstrator. Laser communication technologies are the next revolution in satellite communications (satcom), bringing unprecedented transmission rates, data security and resilience to meet commercial needs in the next decade.

The UltraAir terminal will be capable of laser connections between an aircraft and a satellite in geostationary orbit 36,000 km above the Earth, with unparalleled technology including a highly stable and precise optical mechatronic system. The technology demonstrator will pave the way for a future UltraAir product with which data transmission rates could reach several gigabits-per-second while providing anti-jamming and low probability of interception. In this way UltraAir will not only enable military aircraft and UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) to connect within a combat cloud, but also in the longer term allow airline passengers to establish high-speed data connections thanks to the Airbus’ SpaceDataHighway constellation. From their position in geostationary orbit, the SpaceDataHighway (EDRS) satellites relay data collected by observation satellites to Earth in near-real-time, a process that would normally take several hours.

Airbus is leading the project and brings its unique expertise in laser satellite communications, developed with the SpaceDataHighway programme. It will coordinate the development of the terminal and testing on the ground and in the air. As key partner of the project, TNO provides its experience in high-precision opto-mechatronics, supported by the Dutch high-tech and space industry. Airbus Defence and Space in the Netherlands will be responsible for the industrial production of the terminals. Airbus’ subsidiary Tesat brings its technical expertise in laser communication systems and will be involved in all testing activities.

The first tests will take place at the end of 2021 in laboratory conditions at Tesat. In a second phase, ground tests will start early 2022 in Tenerife (Spain), where connectivity will be established between an UltraAir demonstrator and the laser terminal embarked on the Alphasat satellite using the ESA Optical Ground Station. For the final verification, the UltraAir demonstrator will be integrated on an aircraft for flight testing by mid-2022.

As satellite services demand is growing, the traditional satcom radio-frequency bands are experiencing bottlenecks. Laser links also have the benefit of avoiding interference and detection, as in comparison to the already-crowded radio frequencies, laser communication is extremely difficult to intercept due to a much narrower beam. Thus, laser terminals can be lighter, consume less power and offer even better security than radio.

This new programme is a key milestone in the roadmap of Airbus’ overall strategy to drive laser communications further, which will bring forward the benefits of this technology as a key differentiator for providing Multi-Domain collaboration for Government and defence customers.

Sustainable aviation fuel: A recipe for cleaner flight - Airbus,"Thu, 01 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIxLTA0LXN1c3RhaW5hYmxlLWF2aWF0aW9uLWZ1ZWwtYS1yZWNpcGUtZm9yLWNsZWFuZXItZmxpZ2h00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A new generation of sustainable aviation fuel is being made from recycled materials like cooking oil or municipal waste. In comparison to fossil fuels, they can reduce CO2 emissions by 80%.

Technological innovation has changed many aspects of aviation in recent decades, significantly improving the sustainability of flight. Today, aircraft emit 80% fewer CO2 emissions per seat kilometre than they did 50 years ago. Despite the industry’s progress, however, one crucial element of aviation has remained relatively unchanged: fossil-based aircraft fuel.

Cleaner alternative propulsion technologies, such as electric, hybrid-electric and hydrogen, are under development. However, as they are unlikely to be commercially available until the 2030s, more immediate solutions are required. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) can help.

Sustainable aviation fuels are made from renewable raw material. Today most commonly used feedstocks are crops based or used cooking oil and animal fat.

Lignocellulosic feedstocks (such as forestry or agricultural wastes and residues) will also enter into SAF production alongside Municipal Solid Wastes (MSW) or Algae. Promising technologies (such as electro-fuels) based on carbon from waste gases or direct air capture combined with Hydrogen obtained from renewable energy will complete the picture of all the SAF potentials.

In comparison to fossil fuels, SAF can reduce lifecycle CO2 emissions by 80%.

Crucially, SAF is a ‘drop-in’ fuel. Because its chemical and physical characteristics are almost identical to those in conventional aviation fuel, the two can be safely mixed. Neither the supply infrastructure nor the aircraft themselves require any adaptation. That flexibility has already seen SAF used in more than 300,000 flights since 2011.

Contributing to sustainability targets

SAF is an important part of aviation’s path towards more sustainable flight. In combination with other initiatives, such as new materials and enhanced air traffic management, it can help the industry meet its decarbonisation targets (as per the Air Transport Action Group's CO2 emission goals committed to in 2008). These include:

Improving the fuel efficiency of the worldwide fleet by an average of 1.5% per annum between 2009 and 2020. This first target has been achieved with more than 2% CO2 reduction per annum throughout the period.

From 2020, aviation will compensate CO2 emissions (over the 2019 emissions baseline). This means that even though air travel is increasing, CO2 emissions will be mitigated;

Net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050: The long-term climate goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 supports the Paris Agreement's 1.5ºC goal.

Despite these benefits, adoption of SAF has been limited so far. This isn’t for lack of intent: airlines have committed to forward purchase agreements for around six billion litres of SAF. In 2020 SAF production was around 190,000 tonnes – which remains less than 0.1% of the industry’s total fuel consumption. A major barrier is price, as SAF is two to three times the cost of fossil fuel. The industry believes that achieving between 1.4% to 3.7% of global jet fuel from non-fossil sources by 2025 could create a tipping point for production and cost of SAF.

Driving progress in sustainable aviation fuel

Airbus recognises the importance of driving progress in SAF and it plays a key role in our long-term decarbonisation strategy. Airbus was the first manufacturer to offer customers the option of delivering new aircraft with a blend of SAF. Multiple airlines have benefited from this programme, developed in association with Air BP and Total. We are also heavily involved in the ITAKA European initiative, which aims to speed up the commercialisation of sustainable aviation fuel in Europe. Airbus is also working with other industry players to increase the certified percentage blend of SAF from the current 50% to 100%. And as part of the overall long-term strategy to decarbonise Airbus' industrial operations, SAF has been progressively introduced to power the Beluga fleet since December 2019.

In December 2019, Beluga ST is starting to use Sustainable Aviation Fuel in Hamburg. The sustainable fuel used for the Beluga fleet comes from used cooking oil","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.5842874050140381}",positive,0.5842874050140381,1
JetBlue takes delivery of A321LR with the first Airspace interior - Airbus,"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0wNC1qZXRibHVlLXRha2VzLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LW9mLWEzMjFsci13aXRoLXRoZS1maXJzdC1haXJzcGFjZS1pbnRlcmlvctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Supporting JetBlue’s plans to open new transatlantic routes

First airline to feature Airbus’ new Airspace cabin on Single-Aisle aircraft



Hamburg, Germany, 29 April 2021 – U.S.-based JetBlue Airways has taken delivery of its first of 13 A321LR aircraft featuring Airbus’ new Airspace interior. These new A321LRs support JetBlue’s plan to open its highly anticipated transatlantic services, starting with direct flights to London later this year. In addition to these 13 new A321LRs, the airline also has on order another 57 Airbus aircraft comprising other A321neo variants – which will also feature Airspace cabins. By bringing Airspace to the Single-Aisle Family, JetBlue’s A321 cabins will be the very first to feature Airbus’ new award-winning cabin design-language and passenger-pleasing cabin features -- which are consistent with Airbus’ A330neo and A350 Widebody aircraft.

Robin Hayes, CEO of JetBlue Airways Corp. said: “At JetBlue we are eagerly looking forward to introducing the Airbus A321 Long Range single-aisle aircraft with Airbus’ Airspace interior for our new transatlantic services. These aircraft will allow us to offer our customers attentive, boutique-style service, while also ensuring ample personal space, larger overhead bins, customized lighting and a design that gives the cabin a wide-body feel.”

““We are thrilled to have JetBlue set yet another trend and introduce Airbus’ new Airspace cabin on its long range service,“ said Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer. “For sure the outstanding comfort and in-flight transatlantic experience on board these aircraft will be a winner – for JetBlue, its valued passengers and crew alike!”

Airspace brings to the A320 Family the following passenger-pleasing cabin enhancements: unique welcome and customisable hero lighting (which helps reduce jet lag); new slimmer sidewall panels for extra personal space at shoulder level; better views through the windows with their redesigned bezels and completely integrated window shades; the latest full LED lighting technologies; the largest overhead bin in class; and new lavatories with hygienic touchless features and antimicrobial surfaces.

In addition to these Airspace elements, the A320 Family’s wide cabin cross-section also enables JetBlue to offer its passengers true long-haul comfort in all classes, with 24 full-flat adaptive-mattress seats in the airline’s Mint premium-class private suites, while 114 economy passengers will appreciate the widest 18.4inch seats with a contoured seat-back for extra knee space. Most of these economy seats will offer a full 32inch pitch, while four rows will be optimised for “Even More Space” seating -- offering around an additional five inches for the most legroom in any transatlantic economy class seat.

JetBlue’s passengers in these A321LRs will also be able to stay connected throughout the flight with the airline’s unlimited, free high-speed Wi-Fi. In addition, they will have access to a curated selection of live TV channels focused on news and sports, and an extensive library of seatback entertainment – allowing for a ‘multiple screen’ experience onboard. Seats will also feature easy-to-reach in-seat power, featuring AC and USB-C ports to keep their hand-held devices fully charged. As well as offering the rich portfolio of entertainment and connectivity options for each passenger, the in-seat equipment on these aircraft will also put the customer in control of their food choices, allowing them to customize their own meal right on their seatback screen.

In 2017 at the APEX Expo in Long Beach, JetBlue was unveiled as the launching customer for Airbus’ Airspace cabin for the A320 Family. Following the announcement, Airbus and JetBlue worked together to bring to reality a new level of passenger experience for JetBlue’s passengers in its A321LRs featuring Airspace for the first time.

The longstanding partnership between Airbus and JetBlue began in 1999 when JetBlue was launched and took delivery of its first A320. Two years later the airline placed an order for 48 Airbus planes. Following years of extraordinary growth, JetBlue now operates a fleet of more than 200 A320 and A321 aircraft and has around another 70 on order -- including more of these A321LRs, as well as other A321neo variants – all of which will feature Airspace interiors. In addition, the airline has also placed orders for Airbus’ smallest Single-Aisle Family member, the A220 airliner, the first of which will soon enter service.

The A321LR, a member of the A320neo Family, delivers 30 percent fuel savings and nearly 50 percent reduction in noise footprint compared to previous generations of aircraft. With an increased range of up to 4,000nm (7,400km), the A321LR is the unrivalled long-range route opener, featuring true transatlantic capability and premium wide-body comfort in a single-aisle aircraft cabin. With its new fleet the airlines benefit from the lowest operating costs in the respective size categories, as well as the unique commonality between variants of the Airbus Family.

At the end of March 2021, the A320neo Family had received more than 7,450 firm orders from over 120 customers worldwide.

The Racer programme reaches cruise speed - Airbus,"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA0LXRoZS1yYWNlci1wcm9ncmFtbWUtcmVhY2hlcy1jcnVpc2Utc3BlZWTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Racer programme is one of Airbus Helicopters most exciting innovation projects and one that illustrates the company’s approach to innovation, which is focused on delivering value to customers and lowering helicopter emissions.

Developed in the frame of the European Research Clean Sky 2 project, which involves 40 partners in 13 European countries, the high-speed demonstrator will be optimised for a cruise speed of more than 400 km/h (the average helicopter can reach a top speed of about 260 km/h) and aims at achieving the best trade-off between speed, cost-efficiency and mission performance. Fuel savings will be generated thanks to the innovative Safran eco-mode hybrid-electrical system, which allows one of the two Aneto-1X engines to be shut down while in cruise flight. The particular architecture of the Racer formula will also contribute to lowering its operational acoustic footprint.

The Racer demonstrator – developed as part of the European Clean Sky 2 research programme – has an optimal blend of high performance and reduced operating costs.

The demonstrator takes shape

Unveiled at the Paris Air Show in 2017, the Racer demonstrator passed its critical design review in 2019 before the manufacturing of some long lead items was achieved in 2020. The recent completion of the demonstrator’s centre fuselage represents a decisive milestone for the programme as it marks the start of the Racer’s assembly.

This first assembly phase is taking place at Airbus Helicopters' site in Donauwörth, Germany and will involve the installation of several major components such as the canopy, the box-wings, the fuel system, the cowlings, and more. Later this year, the Racer will be transferred to Airbus Helicopters’ site in Marignane, France for the final assembly and subsequent launch of the flight campaign in 2022.

Here is a “sneak peek” at some of the Racer’s major components that will soon be assembled:

The central fuselage: Designed and manufactured by Romania’s RoRCraft consortium, formed by INCAS (the National Institute for Aerospace Research “Elia Cafaroli”) and the aerospace company ROMAERO, the Racer lightweight airframe is a major achievement for the teams. This is the first time such an advanced hybrid helicopter structure, incorporating both metallic and composite primary structural elements, has been produced in Romania. The RoRCraft consortium will also be contributing to the demonstrator flight clearance by designing and conducting ground tests and stress analysis of the required fuselage parts.

Romania’s RoRCraft consortium designed and manufactured the Racer high-speed demonstrator’s centre fuselage section.

The side shells: Made of carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP), the 3.4 x 1.5 metre cover for the Racer’s side panels connects the tail boom to the aircraft’s cockpit. Such large format CFRP shells are traditionally made manually, but the Racer’s shell components have been manufactured in a highly automated process thanks to a new method developed by a research team from the Fraunhofer Institute for Foundry, Composite and Processing Technology IGCV in Germany.

The Racer high-speed demonstrator’s side shells were manufactured in a highly automated process

This team has also conducted the mechanical tests of the material combination and new manufacturing process required to receive flight authorisation. The intermediate side shells have already been assembled on the Racer airframe by Romania’s RoRCraft consortium.

The canopy: Developed by the German FastCan consortium, formed by KLK Motorsport GMBH and Modell und Formenbau Blasius Gerg GmbH, the Racer’s innovative carbon fibre canopy is a good example of the synergies between the automotive and aerospace industries. The FastCan consortium has leveraged the automotive design expertise and manufacturing technologies to create a lightweight canopy, which is optimised for low aerodynamic draft and a good field of view. The Racer canopy will integrate lightweight, erosion-resistant windows and windshieldscapable of withstanding bird strikes, even at high speeds, and were developed by the WIMPER consortium, which comprises the KRD Sicherheitstechnik GmbH, the German Aerospace Center DLR, the Institute of Structures and Design, and the Stuttgart University’s Institute of Aircraft Design.

The fuel system: The Racer’s fuel system design and manufacturing is the result of a collaboration between the ActionRcraft consortium, composed of Safran Aerosystems, which is in charge of the fuel storage, and the StrongCraft consortium, formed by Safran Aerosystems, Secondo Mona and the Netherlands Aerospace Center, responsible for the fuel distribution, gauging and ventilation systems. Starting from a classical fuel system design, the main challenge was to adapt it to the demonstrator’s new capabilities in terms of speed, acceleration, and climb and descent rates. The fuel system will continue being put to the test during the coming ground and flight tests in order to ensure its performance. The Racer’s fuel system has been designed with a lightweight tank bladder material and a new optical sensor is under development to be tested in the fuel bench in different conditions.

The wings: The British ASTRAL consortium, composed of AERNOVA Hamble Aerostructures and the Institute for Advanced Manufacturing at the University of Nottingham, are responsible for the design and manufacturing of the innovative Racer wings, one of the most striking elements of the demonstrator. Optimised for aerodynamic efficiency, the patented “double wing” or “box wing” provides lift in cruise mode while enhancing safety around the demonstrator during ground operations. With the aim to contribute to the lower emissions objective of the Clean Sky 2 programme, each new wing on the Racer has been designed with high-performance ecological materials that reduce the weight of the aircraft. The new wings actively enhance the helicopter’s performance by providing additional vertical lift and the ability to fly further and faster than traditional helicopters.

The landing gear: The Racer’s landing gear has been designed, manufactured and tested by the ANGELA consortium, formed by the Centro Italiano Ricerche Aerospaziali, Magnaghi Aeronautica and the Lithuanian-based Techno System Development. Integrated inside the wing and fuselage with a movable-door system, the landing gear was conceived to minimize drag when retracted. When extended, the system will provide a large track for a safe landing. The reference product of the Magnaghi Aeronautica group for more than eighty years, the landing gear system is currently undergoing all the tests required for the flight clearance at their test centre near Naples.

The Racer high-speed demonstrator’s landing gear was designed to minimise drag when retracted

The rear fuselage: Based on an Airbus Helicopters patent, the Racer rear fuselage has been a challenge for the Airbus Helicopters teams in Spain, supported by the Outcome consortium led by Aernnova, for its dimensions, weight target and its asymmetric cross-section profile, designed to optimise hover performances without penalizing the forward and cruise flights phases.

Likewise, its atypical H-shaped empennage and double tilted vertical/horizontal stabiliser,patented by Airbus Helicopters and ONERA, devised to enhance stability and energy consumption, have also required the implementation of innovative technologies. The Racer will be the first Airbus aircraft to fly with a primary structure, produced using additive manufacturing.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9826699495315552}",neutral,0.9826699495315552,0

“Testing cabin comfort, ambience functionality and lighting design is typically an emotional experience we offer our customers in the Customer Definition Centre. Due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, the challenge we have faced is to re-invent the ways we interact with customers, providing the highest level of cabin definition in a fully digital way”, explains Alexander Jürs, Customer Service and Communication Manager at the CDC in Hamburg.

A virtual cabin definition experience

In close cooperation with Airbus' subsidiary Testia and Information Management teams, the CDC was able to run customer definitions for the cabin, using a combination of virtual remote assistance, video conferences and live 3D Digital Mock-Up (DMU), when attendance in person was not possible. The combined solution offered by this partnership is available on smartphones and supporting digital devices enabling customers, suppliers and Airbus to perform many aspects of the cabin definition process on time, quality and without incurring additional costs.



In 2020, around a third of all CDC definition meetings have been managed virtually, with an overall customer satisfaction rate of 96%. Air New Zealand was one of the many airlines to benefit from the newly developed capability in the CDC. “Due to the pandemic and the need to continue development work remotely on cabin interiors. It is great to see Airbus thinking ahead on how the CDC can service the needs of the airlines. The remote live lighting session was excellent and very beneficial for us,” says Ed Collett the new Aircraft Programme Manager for Air New Zealand.



“In these difficult times, our customers are increasingly aware that our virtual live definition sessions are an efficient solution to reconnect all relevant stakeholders in one single digital place - even if they are looking forward to coming back physically in the CDC as soon as they can,” says Alexander.



2021 seems to confirm this trend and the remote solution developed by Airbus and Testia continues to smooth the customers’ cabin definition journey.

Known as the “Vertex” project, the program will see Flightlab — a modified H130 — controlled through a touchscreen tablet. A pilot will use the tablet to set a destination and choose a route suggested by the system. From there, the aircraft will manage navigation and route preparation, take off, follow the predefined flight path, and land. It will also have an obstacle detection capability to be able to perform a sense-and-avoid function at low speed and low height.

Airbus said the capabilities being developed by Vertex would be of benefit to its existing rotary-wing product line, as well as having a clear role in enabling urban air mobility systems to become a reality.

“Vertex wants to provide pilots [with] a new piloting experience,” Séverin Dauvergne, head of the Vertex demonstrator program, told reporters during a media briefing. “This will allow you to simplify the way a helicopter or VTOL is flown today. . . . [It] gives you the opportunity to almost forget the task of piloting . . . and you just focus as a pilot on your mission, and on your flight.”

The components of Vertex include a suite of cutting-edge sensors, cameras, and lidar (light detection and ranging) technology, which together will create a vast bank of data to give the aircraft a clear picture of its environment at any given moment.

The lidar is critical because it enables the system to instantly detect the exact distance to various objects. The one used in Vertex will be a next-generation lidar, and is currently being developed by leading automotive lidar supplier Luminar Technologies.

“It gives us the correct range acquisition that we want, the correct field of view that we want, and the correct definition that we are expecting,” said Dauvergne. “So, clearly, we are going into a next step of sensors compared to the previous [generation of] lidar.”

Two powerful computers — one for the vision system, one for the avionics — are the brains of Vertex, each providing 500 to 800 times more computing power than is used within any in-production helicopter. These will process the data provided from the various sensors and apply algorithms to control the fully fly-by-wire aircraft.

“[The computers] will allow us not only to make the acquisition of the data, but also to run all of our algorithms, the obstacle detection, the 3D map reconstructions for the landing, the 2D tracker for the helipad recognition, and much more,” said Dauvergne.

With such a system, the pilot will still be able to change course at any time — they will simply need to tap a new point of interest on the tablet.

Finally, so that the pilot isn’t spending the flight staring at a tablet on their knee, Vertex will include a heads up display in the form of small glasses.

During a media briefing with reporters, Grazia Vittadini, the company’s chief technology officer, said pilots would remain the decision makers, with automated and autonomous technologies simply serving to support the pilot’s decision making and increase safety.

“For over 50 years, Airbus has taken great care to design a safe environment for pilots for passengers and crew,” she said. “This is why we’re so excited about Vertex’s potential to simplify mission preparation, mission management, to reduce the helicopter pilot’s workload, and above all else, to further increase safety for our current helicopter range, and for all future vehicles.”

Clearly, the latter is expected to include urban air mobility vehicles, and Vittadini highlighted how a system such a Vertex will likely be needed as these new aircraft first appear in our skies. “We believe [they] will not be deployed on large scale autonomously from the beginning,” she said. “We believe that this set of technologies [in Vertex] will be a fundamental stepping stone to fully autonomous flight . . . in the urban air mobility segment. So it’s not just what will it bring to the existing product [range], but also it has a very strong, let’s say, forward-looking perspective.”

Flightlab testing continues

Airbus has now recorded close to 30 flight hours with Flightlab, with testing to date developing a rotor strike alerting system (due to hit the market as a kit later this year), exploring how to lower the impact of helicopter noise, and maturing an advanced health and usage monitoring systems (HUMS) based on digital accelerometers.

A third of the total flight hours have been spent gathering data with the EAGLE (eye for autonomous guidance and landing extension) image detection system. This system utilizes a gyro-stabilized camera to analyze the aircraft’s environment, and these images are processed using artificial intelligence to find areas of importance (either to fly towards or away from).

“Maybe the number of hours seems low, but… the system was mature from the beginning,” said Dauvergne. “The pilots were very impressed by the quality of the system from the beginning, and so we simply had to stop because we had enough data.”

Demonstrations to date have not connected EAGLE to the aircraft’s flight controls. Dauvergne said the next step towards the autonomy of Vertex would be taken next year, with the installation of a third pilot seat in the Flightlab demonstrator, equipped with a joystick control. This will be used to provide electrical inputs to the flight controls.

“The joystick allows piloting by objectives,” he explained. “You just put the stick in one direction, and the computer solves the function of the mission you want to realize.”

However, the full Vertex demonstration flights will be controlled only by the tablet. With a robust use of simulation to test systems and train pilots, Dauvergne said he hopes to be able to achieve Airbus’s goals with the Vertex program in as little as 20 flight hours in early 2023.

Dauvergne said Airbus is in ongoing discussions with EASA to determine the reliability requirements for systems that exist to enhance safety. “Potentially we could have a relaxation [in failure probability] on systems which are by nature improving the safety,” he said.

The Vertex program is being managed by Airbus UpNext, a subsidiary created to fast-track future technologies.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9989508390426636}",neutral,0.9989508390426636,0
Airbus and Clean Sky 2 support environmental protection - Airbus,"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA0LWFpcmJ1cy1hbmQtY2xlYW4tc2t5LTItc3VwcG9ydC1lbnZpcm9ubWVudGFsLXByb3RlY3Rpb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Earth Day is celebrated each year on April 22. Born in 1970, this environmental movement reminds people and companies about the importance of preserving our planet via meaningful decisions and valuable actions.

Airbus and the defence industry in general are increasingly committed to invest in sustainable Research and Development (R&D) initiatives. By developing new projects and more efficient systems aimed at sustainability and emission reduction, as well as transforming industrial processes to meet the challenges of Industry 4.0, new standards requested by key industry players that reduce the environmental footprint are being prioritised.

Airbus invests significant resources with the clear goal of contributing to a more sustainable aviation sector and is fully committed to support European industry’s 2030-2050 sustainability targets. It does so via different initiatives, not onlyby minimising its energy use and C02 emissions, but also for instance by limiting its water consumption and reducing waste.

In this context, Airbus through its defence business is part of Clean Sky 2 (CS2). With a timeframe of ten years (2014-2024), CS2 is the largest European Research Programme developing innovative, cutting-edge technologies/solutions aimed at reducing the environmental impact of the aviation industry, improving industry competitiveness and increasing mobility efficiency.

Within the military aircraft business, innovative projects are underway in order to meet ambitious challenges in the reduction of emissions, thanks to: new and more efficient structures design; the improvement of industrial processes; and the use of new materials.

Following the objectives established in the first edition of Clean Sky, the objective of Clean Sky 2 is to reduce an additional 20-30% of CO2, 20-30% NOx and 20-30% of noise. By 2050 the ambition is to reduce CO2, NOx and noise emissions by up to 75%, 90% and 65% respectively.

Flight Test Bed 2

Jose Antonio Urbano, R&D Chief Engineer at Airbus Defence and Space, explains how Airbus is contributing to achieve these goals:

1. What is the specific role of Airbus Defence and Space in Clean Sky 2?

In 2014 we became a founder member of the programme, in which we are also co-leader of the AIRFRAME Integrated Technology Demonstrator workstream. In addition, we contribute with what is known as Flight Test Bed 2, which is a C295 acting as a flight demonstrator in which different innovative technologies can be tested.

2. How does Airbus Defence and Space concretely contribute to achieve European industry’s 2030-2050 sustainability targets?

Airbus Defence and Space, not only through the Clean Sky 2 programme, but also with the development of many other innovative projects, contributes to reducing the environmental footprint in three different areas: new designs and more efficient aero structures, which ensure a significant reduction of emissions; the use of new, cleaner materials, including new recycling processes; and the transformation of our production and industrial activities in order to meet the challenges of Industry 4.0.

3. How does the latest design optimisation of aerostructures help to reduce emissions?

In the field of new designs and more efficient aerostructures, we are currently working on the integration of a highly efficient wing on our Flight Test Bed. It is a semi-morphing wing, which replicates what birds already do – adapting their wings and feathers to the different flight conditions to always be optimal and reduce energy consumption. We try to equip the wing with many movable surfaces that adapt to the flight conditions, reducing aerodynamic drag, consumption and therefore emissions.

The objective is to progress with the aero-efficiency of more durable, affordable and lighter-weight wing structures through their innovative design.

4. How much of a reduction in CO2/NOx/noise emissions can be achieved?

To achieve significant emissions reduction, the challenge is to develop and demonstrate a combination of different technologies on the C295 Flight Test Bed 2. These focus on the design of the high-efficient wing prototype as well as with the incorporation of innovative manufacturing processes and new materials out of the autoclave. The combination of all these technologies and performance improvements (in drag and weight) in addition to a new power plant, would result in a 43% CO2 and 77% NOx emission reduction achieved in a typical scenario for a Search and Rescue/Surveillance Mission (400 Nautical Miles) on the concept aircraft compared to a current C295.

5. How can a change in the industrial process contribute to a cleaner planet?

In order to reduce global warming, energy consumption, water pollution and usage, as well as NOx emissions, we have developed different initiatives related to our industrial processes in line with the eco-efficient factories of the future.

Thanks to collaborative robots our daily operations are simplified, reducing the production lead time and consequently energy consumption. For the selected use case a 3% reduction of primary energy demand has been found.

Additionally, we have started using new cleaner fuel leakage detection process. Using Helium or Hydrogen for our leakage identification system represents an 80% reduction in polluting substances.

The digitalisation of our factories, paving the way to Industry 4.0., also plays a key role with the optimisation of tools and resources and consequently a reduction of 13% in energy consumption for the use case studied.

We are also changing the way we test our aircraft systems by creating digital models: a very precise digital mock-up, where we integrate physical models to test them so to avoid running the aircraft and consequently reducing energy consumption and emissions.

6. What are the latest developments in the use of new materials?

Among the different technologies we are developing, thermoplastics in-situ consolidation is being tested which will enable the recycling and re-use of carbon fibre waste for less critical aircraft components. In addition, the production processes using thermoplastics are much more efficient thanks to the possibility of using lasers to heat the material instead of autoclaves, which represents a huge reduction in energy consumption.

Sharing the Experience: @iflyheli's new Airbus H130 - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmVzL3NoYXJpbmctdGhlLWV4cGVyaWVuY2UtaWZseWhlbGlzLW5ldy1haXJidXMtaDEzMC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Photos by Mike Reyno

As York Galland lifted off from EuroTec’s Millgrove, Ontario, facility on a freezing February morning, he was doing so in one of the most heavily-customized and high-tech Airbus H130s ever flown.

York Galland has built up a loyal audience on Instagram, with over 100,000 people following his adventures on his @iflyheli account.

The aircraft — registration N130 — had just completed an extensive four-month completion process, with no part left untouched and/or upgraded. These included advanced avionics in the form of a Garmin G500H TXi, GTN 750Xi, and GTN 650Xi; a True Blue TB17 lithium-ion battery; a HeliSAS stability augmentation system and autopilot; external cameras mounted on the belly of the aircraft and on the tail; internal cameras to record flights from passengers’ points of view; a Meeker utility mount carrying a Shotover B1 gimbal system; a Max-Viz enhanced vision system (EVS); and high-end finishes throughout.

Galland is better known to aviation enthusiasts around the world by his Instagram handle @iflyheli, through which he shares photos and videos of his amazing journeys over some of the most spectacular and photogenic landscapes in North America. And it’s fair to say he’s been pretty successful with it — since launching his Instagram page in 2014, Galland has gained over 104,000 followers, making him one of the more recognizable figures in the rotary-wing industry, while his social media presence has led to collaborations with Red Bell and GoPro, and countless others.

The H130 lifts off from a helipad near downtown Toronto. It’s one of the most technologically-advanced examples of the type in the world, following an extensive completion process at EuroTec.

“iflyheli today is a lifestyle platform showing that helicopters aren’t just used for long lining, or putting out fires, or tourism work; they can be used for getting from point A to point B, and with an amazing visual experience along the way that you don’t get in an airplane,” Galland told Vertical.

“You’re having this incredible flight experience, seeing things that many people have not seen from that perspective. iflyheli has become this platform to share that with people; either people I’m working with, or we’re flying together for one reason or another, or they’re experiencing it vicariously through my social media. It’s become this platform to share the beauty of flight, and the beauties of this Earth.”

While Galland is best known as a rotary-wing pilot, he began his professional aviation life as a fixed-wing pilot. Having secured his fixed-wing license at 21, he spent several years working as a corporate pilot. He often saw helicopters at the airport, and eventually decided to book a trial flight. He was hooked from the first moment at the controls, and gained his rotary-wing license just a couple of months later.

However, helicopter flight remained nothing more than an occasional hobby, until his cousin — a filmographer — encouraged him to do something more with it.

“I just thought helicopters were something you either did tours or utility work with,” said Galland. “My cousin said, ‘Well, you’re passionate about film and photography. If you got a helicopter, we would use you for aerial filming. I’d keep you busy.’ ”

Galland’s wife was supportive of the idea, and in 2010 he took the plunge, purchasing a Robinson R44 along with some “entry-level video equipment.”

A few jobs followed through word-of-mouth, and with Galland’s focus on photography flights, his daughter suggested he set up an Instagram account to market the business.

“The final product far exceeded my expectations. Just in the little details, from the stitching on the interior to getting quality, titanium screws, and powder coating things that could be powder coated. With all those little details, it came out amazing.”

Not long after this, Galland ended up taking a photographer from New York on a flight in Los Angeles. It turned out the photographer had about a million followers on Instagram, and after the flight, he offered to send Galland a series of pics to post and tag.

“Within a month I think I had 3,000 followers, most of which were photographers interested in aerial photography. So, I had more aerial photography work than I wanted to do!” he said.

According to Galland, @iflyheli then quickly evolved from being a photo and aerial film platform to being a “lifestyle” platform.

Galland described the H130 as his “ultimate” platform. He now has about 3,000 rotorcraft flight hours and has added various levels of complexity and power with each new type he has flown.

Now based in Colorado and Utah, Galland flies about 300 hours a year, and these flights can take him anywhere in North America. “Any time I can go cross-country, I welcome it,” he said.

For Galland, the beauty and appeal of rotary-wing flight is in the unique access and perspectives it provides. “There are some places we’ve landed where I’m thinking, ‘I don’t think anybody has been here before.’ It can feel like you’re on a different planet when you’re somewhere unexplored or untouched. You feel like you’re in a new in a new world.”

Making the transition

After beginning his rotary-wing business with a Robinson R44, Galland transitioned to a much-loved R66, in which he flew 1,200 hours in three years. He then became an “early adopter” of the Bell 505 Jet Ranger X, for which he still holds much affection. He praised both the R66 and 505 for the visibility they provided for pilot and passengers, but the H130 was always his ultimate target as a platform.

“It’s a bigger aircraft, it’s more to handle, and I think it’s something where you’re better off having some time and experience,” he said. “I have about 3,000 hours in rotorcraft right now, and the way that I kind of worked my way up to a 5,500-pound [2,495-kilogram] aircraft was just to take these intermediate steps with complexity and with power.”

The H130, said Galland, continues the tradition of providing exceptional visibility, adds plenty of power, has space for seven comfortable seats, and is able to carry all the tech he wanted.

“It’s a perfect machine for me,” he said. “It’s not a working machine, it’s a flying machine for me.”

The particular aircraft he chose was a used one, but only lightly. Just six years old, it only had a few hours on the airframe. He chose EuroTec for the completion having seen the company’s previous work at tradeshows over the years.

“I had enough confidence in Hoss [Golanbari, VP and managing director at EuroTec] and his team, that I knew by the time they were done with it, it would be better than new — they would go through every single thing in the aircraft and if it wasn’t perfect, they’d make it perfect.”

The seven seats feature fine leather coverings, with the “iflyHeli” logo repeated in a variety of locations around the inside and outside of the aircraft.

For the ultimate in clear visibility from the cockpit, all the windows were polished and ceramic coated, inside and out, by Amaris Premium Aviation. Not only did this process clear the windows of any marks made over the previous six years, but it also eliminated the “micro-swirls” that appear in aircraft even direct from the factory. These are most often apparent when flying into the sun.

Amaris also provided the reflective ceramic shine protecting the H130’s new vibrant red livery. This is offset by another custom touch — a matte black exhaust.

A high-tech completion

The technology contained within the aircraft isn’t just there to provide more toys to play with — almost every piece enhances safety.

“I fly at night, I fly cross-country, I fly to new airports, I fly to areas I’ve never been before, and there are certain risks that you’re assuming when you do these things,” explained Galland. “You’re in unfamiliar situations, or if you’re doing a lot of cross-country, you’re going to come in and out of weather, so there might be some lower visibility scenarios. And I think the technology that I have in this H130 really creates a layer of safety that is important for my mission.”

The technology — including the Garmin avionics suite — allows for enhanced weather and flight planning, and provides for increased situational awareness in-flight.

The external cameras provide views of the skids and tail, taking any guesswork out of the surrounding environment during landing or taking off, while the Max-Viz EVS helps in low visibility conditions.

“I think the technology that I have in this H130 really creates a layer of safety that is important for my mission.”

While Galland had a list of items he wanted to include as part of the completion, EuroTec also provided input that shaped the final product. An example of the later was the Max-Viz EVS, which Golanbari suggested would be a useful aid given Galland’s flights to unfamiliar and confined areas. Getting it into the aircraft required a new supplemental type certificate (STC).

Another new STC was required for the installation of the True Blue Power TB17 lithium ion battery, which provides an enhanced lifespan (eight-plus years), increased available power, quicker starts and reduced maintenance costs — all in a lighter package.

EuroTec also created a video display and a mixer that allows Galland to switch between different cameras, internal and external, and record everything his passengers see during a flight.

“I have never been so proud of the entire EuroTec team, with the way they worked on this project during this unprecedented time while providing the level of attention to detail for which we are known throughout the industry,” said EuroTec’s Golanbari. “The personal trust York displayed in us to give us a ‘carte blanche’ to truly amaze and surprise him was greatly appreciated and will never be forgotten. It was an amazingly fun build for the entire EuroTec team, and we managed to provide him with what we think is the coolest and most advanced H130 anywhere in the world.”

The H130 flies alongside another recent EuroTec completion over Niagara Falls.

Throughout the completion process, Galland received weekly emails, with photos and video updates.

“The final product far exceeded my expectations,” he said. “Just in the little details, from the stitching on the interior to getting quality, titanium screws, and powder coating things that could be powder coated. With all those little details, it came out amazing.”

The aircraft has even been fine tuned for Galland’s mission, balanced to fly at the speed he typically flies at. “Hoss [Golanbari]’s promise was when this aircraft will be delivered, it’ll look, smell and fly better than new — as though it came from the factory. And it’s even better than that.”

The aircraft has lots of storage space for equipment to take on adventures.

Now back in Colorado with Galland — following a special photo shoot with Vertical over Niagara Falls and downtown Toronto — the H130 has quickly become a social media star in its own right. Fans of Galland, and the H130, will be able to follow their adventures exploring some of the more untouched parts of North America on Instagram, where iflyheli will continue to showcase the unique perspective that rotary-wing flight can provide.

“I still have my cautions and my worries about social media and its potential to be destructive,” said Galland. “But I’ve also learned that it’s got a lot of potential to spread a lot of good vibes and beautiful things.

The completion process took four months and touched every part of the aircraft. “The final product far exceeded my expectations,” said Galland.

“One criticism I had [before joining Instagram] is that you don’t have any ‘real’ friends on social media; they’re just digital friends,” he continued. “But the coolest product of flying has been the people I’ve met, and the helicopter and social media were both key ingredients. I would say most of my best friends right now are people that I actually know — in real life we’ve met, we’ve flown together — and it was a result of social media.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.884188175201416}",neutral,0.884188175201416,0
Airbus gears up for H160 entry into service - Vertical Magazine,"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWdlYXJzLXVwLWZvci1oMTYwLWVudHJ5LWludG8tc2VydmljZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters is betting on a variety of launch applications, combined with innovative customer support, to rapidly gain experience and establish an impeccable track record for the H160 medium twin.

The first H160 delivery will be to a customer in the U.S., but Airbus is still waiting for FAA approval of the type’s certification. Airbus Photo

The company’s new flagship received its certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) early last summer, but is still waiting for the validation of that approval from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The first delivery is planned to take place in the U.S., which makes the FAA’s seal all the more important to the program.

Travel restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic have prevented FAA personnel from visiting Airbus’s headquarters in Marignane, France. Usually, the validation process takes just six months, according to Bernard Fujarski, the H160’s program manager.

Student pilots cannot travel to Marignane, where an H160 flight simulator has been installed. Airbus has therefore devised a training program that relies on flights only. “But FAA pilots have yet to assess it,” Fujarski said.

Seven deliveries are planned for 2021 to customers in Brazil, France, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S. Applications include search-and-rescue, electronic news gathering, VIP transport and route-proving to oil-and-gas offshore platforms.

The H160’s backlog stands at approximately 40 orders, said Fujarski. That means Airbus’s salespeople have yet to meet the airframer’s stated goal of regaining lost market share against the Leonardo AW139. In 2019-20, Leonardo delivered a total 117 examples of its medium twin.

The first order from the French government is expected soon. It is anticipated to comprise 12 helicopters, most of which will be built like civil ones and used by the Gendarmerie (a police force with military status).

Another governmental contract is being prepared for a military version, in the framework of France’s Joint Light Helicopter program. It will use different mission systems and therefore a new avionics suite.

The H160 inaugurates a new production scheme, based on so-called main component assemblies (MCA). An MCA is built and tested before it reaches the final assembly line (FAL) in Marignane. For example, the central fuselage, including the cockpit, comes from Airbus’s factory in Donauwörth, Germany.

The FAL reuses a hangar that previously housed the AS365/EC155 Dauphin’s FAL. The level of automation has been increased, notably with wire-guided carts. Ergonomics and the prevention of hazards such as musculoskeletal disorders were rethought. Higher platforms give workers easier access to the engines and the main gearbox.

Airbus has planned to ramp up production to one H160 per month by the fourth quarter of 2021, and then two per month in 2022.

The H160 has a number of technological features. On the main rotor, five Blue Edge blades provide increased lift and reduced noise. The landing gear’s retraction system is electrically powered, and the human-machine interface was designed for lower pilot workload.

Airbus counts on those attributes to set a new standard in the 12-seat category and for future helicopter designs. It also has high hopes for the H160’s maintainability and maintenance tools.

Customer support was integrated into the design process right from the beginning, program support manager Laurence Di Costanzo Hernandez told Vertical. The idea was to factor in requirements such as easy access to the engines.

A key step in devising the maintenance program was “Operator Zero,” a simulation of an operational scenario to use job cards and tooling. Those Airbus technicians who usually work at customers’ sites played the role of the customer. “Is the task efficient? Isn’t it too complex? Shall we complement the instructions with a video? The Operator Zero exercise makes the difference between validation and maturity,” said Di Costanzo Hernandez.

In the framework of the MSG-3 (maintenance steering group-3) process to define a maintenance plan, approximately 10 customers and potential customers were involved in working groups. In Airbus’s previous development, the H175, customers had been involved after entry into service.

As for maintenance technician training, new tools are emerging. Tablet-based programs demonstrate how the main systems work. They can be used in a classroom or remotely, said Jean-Charles Pages, the H160 training program manager.

Another tool, the virtual maintenance trainer, helps each student learn to follow a job card at their own pace.

Component training rigs offer hands-on experience. Available are an engine, a main gearbox with accompanying mast, a fully equipped fuel tank, a tailboom, and a landing gear. They can be used at an Airbus site or flown to a customer’s base, said Pages.

Finally, a Helionix trainer simulates the avionics suite, including touchscreens.

Once in service, the H160 will benefit from electronic 3D documentation. Each maintenance task is illustrated with 3D views, some of them in motion, said Marie-Line Bergeonneau, 3D innovative projects manager. The technician can select parts to order.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999704360961914}",neutral,0.9999704360961914,0

Airbus' VSR700 VTOL UAV Achieves New Milestone - Naval News,"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA0L2FpcmJ1cy12c3I3MDAtdnRvbC11YXYtYWNoaWV2ZXMtbmV3LW1pbGVzdG9uZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus’ VSR700 VTOL UAV Achieves New Milestone Airbus announced that its VSR700 vertical take off and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) prototype reached a speed of 60 kts during its latest test flight.

VSR700 will fly off French Navy frigates. 15 ""SDAM"" systems have been order with deliveries starting in 2028.

A few weeks ago, the VSR700 demonstrator achieved a test flight that pushed its speed limit to 60kts (more than 110km/h), entirely opening its flight envelope at low speed. At the end of the test, the demonstrator had accumulated more than 10 flight hours. Thanks to this milestone, the VSR700 programme is getting closer to its goal: providing the French Navy with a sea-demonstration-compatible Unmanned Aerial System (UAS).



Airbus statement

According to Airbus, since the first stages of the test campaign (which consisted in captive test flights) the program has made good progress, with the first fully autonomous take-off and landing over a moving platform late last year. The company is now focused on securing the flight performances and expanding the flight envelope of the aircraft. Sea trials with the French Navy are set to take place in mid-2022.

The VSR700 has been selected as the demonstrator for the for the French Navy’s “Système de Drone Aérien pour la Marine” or SDAM programme. According to the French military planning law (LPM), 15 SDAM systems are set to be delivered to the French Navy from 2028. They will be deployed aboard the future frigates of the French Navy, the FDI as well as the FREMM.

A first SDAM demonstrator is currently being prepared through a de-risking contract signed at the end of 2017. This contract signed by Airbus and Naval Group also involves French SME and in particular Hélicoptères Guimbal, which produces the Cabri G2 helicopter, from which the SDAM is derived. An additional SDAM demonstrator was ordered last year. This second VSR700 will enable the programme to further secure the next steps, and in particular the development of technologies and the refinement of specifications to meet the French Navy’s operational requirements.

The VSR700 made its maiden flight on November 8. 2019 at the Aix-en-Provence drone test center (south of France). Several test captive flights were successfully performed on an enhanced version of the UAV.

The VSR700 has a maximum take-off weight between 500 and 1000 kg, Airbus stated. The VSR700 capabilities are not officially known, but is expected to « automatically land and take-off, fly for ten hours at 100 Nm and carry 100 kilos of payload, i.e. radar and optronics.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996664524078369}",neutral,0.9996664524078369,0
Airbus’ Hydrogen Drive Will Materialize In Demonstrators - Aviation Week,"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9zcGVjaWFsLXRvcGljcy9zdXN0YWluYWJpbGl0eS9haXJidXMtaHlkcm9nZW4tZHJpdmUtd2lsbC1tYXRlcmlhbGl6ZS1kZW1vbnN0cmF0b3Jz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Details released by Airbus about the goals of its conceptual studies on hybrid-electric and electric propulsion and a superconducting technology demonstrator signal the airframer is in full battle order for the service entry of a carbon-neutral aircraft by 2035.

The company presented three concept studies last September for liquid-hydrogen-powered aircraft (AW&ST Sept. 28-Oct. 11, 2020, p. 16). They included a regional turboprop, a narrowbody in the A320-family size category and a blended wing body. In December, Airbus unveiled another potential configuration for a hydrogen-powered aircraft integrating a tank, fuel cell, motor and propeller in each of the arrangement’s six underwing pods.

Fuel cells are involved in all Airbus concept studies

Superconductivity holds out hope to solve key issues in electric architectures

The first three concepts are hybrid-electric. “So it means that in all three concepts we have hydrogen powering gas turbines,” Glenn Llewellyn, vice president of zero-emission aircraft at Airbus, said during a webinar organized by Eurocontrol, the organization in charge of air traffic management in Europe. “In parallel, we can provide the gas turbines with electrical power in what’s called a parallel hybrid configuration.” In such a layout, the gas turbines would probably be designed for the cruise phase, and electrical power would provide a boost for takeoff and climb. The bottom line is more efficient gas turbines.

The electrical power comes from fuel cells. “Once you have hydrogen on board, it makes sense to use fuel cells to create your electrical energy through an efficient process rather than to carry batteries,” Llewellyn said.

The fourth concept uses fuel cells only, without any gas turbine. “We are using this concept and some variants of this concept that we’ve not made public to really understand the scalability of fuel cells, both in terms of technical feasibility and commercial viability,” Llewellyn said.

“[In any case,] hydrogen is the solution that allows us to have the most significant reduction in climate impact. . . . Of course, we have to make sure that we increase the amount of renewable energy and the amount of renewable hydrogen supply available,” he said. CO 2 emissions are practically eliminated when using hydrogen instead of a conventional fuel.

Moreover, so-called non-CO 2 effects are being increasingly understood as being major contributors to aviation’s climate impact. “When we look at nitrogen oxides, when we look at persistent contrails, hydrogen looks like it has the most potential compared to every other option to significantly reduce and potentially eliminate those non-CO 2 effects,” Llewellyn noted. Airbus is counting on extensive demonstration and flight-test programs “to convince us that what we have out of the exhaust of these aircraft is in fact what the theory is telling us,” he said.

The airframer plans to make decisions in 2022-23 about which concept it will take to the next phase. “We are developing technologies, and we will have flight demonstrations up until 2025,” Llewellyn said. “Then, in 2025-26, we’ll be in a position to press the button on the aircraft development activities to achieve an entry into service by 2035.”

As all four concepts rely—at least for a significant portion—on electric propulsion, Airbus has launched an ambitious demonstration program for the use of superconducting technology. It is aiming at a major efficiency improvement.

The idea stems from both the difficulty of designing an electric-propulsion architecture with conventional wiring and the opportunity to use liquid hydrogen as a cold source. Superconducting materials require cryogenic temperatures.

Superconducting technologies have been in service for decades in other industries, such as medical imaging and fundamental physics. In aerospace, the need for superconducting wires as part of high-power electric systems has been suggested for at least a decade. This is the first time, however, that an OEM has embarked on a demonstration program.

Called the Advanced Superconducting and Cryogenic Experimental Power Train Demonstrator (Ascend), Airbus’ project aims to explore “the impact of superconducting materials and cryogenic temperatures on the performance of an aircraft’s electrical propulsion systems.” The ground demonstrator will be designed and built at the airframer’s E-Aircraft System House in Ottobrunn, Germany, under the umbrella of the company’s UpNext research and technology subsidiary. Various configurations—with different cold sources, cooling systems and power levels—will be evaluated by the end of 2023.

The Ascend program looks like a follow-on to the aborted E-Fan X, which had begun studying hybrid-electric propulsion. Led by Airbus and Rolls-Royce, it involved a 3,000-volt electric system. The ability to handle hundreds of kilowatts of heat waste was described as a key challenge.

Superconducting technology solves the heat management issue, thanks to the absence of any resistance and the related Joule effect. The expectation is that the technology will increase efficiency by 5-6% compared to conventional technologies, adds Ludovic Ybanez, head of the Ascend program. The weight of the power train’s components could at a minimum be halved.

It is expected that electrical losses will also be cut in two compared to conventional technologies. Voltage can be reduced below 500 volts, making it easier to manage problems such as arcing.

When using superconductivity, the otherwise-challenging 20K (-424F/-253C) temperature of liquid hydrogen becomes a resource. A secondary system could use a heat exchanger and a neutral, easier-to-handle fluid such as nitrogen, Ybanez suggests. It could cool the superconducting wiring to the required 70-80K.

The technology for the core material is well mastered, the superconducting wiring itself being measured in microns. Cuprate superconductors are a likely choice.

Developing a suitable insulation, likely to have a diameter of 4 in., for use on board an aircraft is a major objective of Ascend, says Ybanez. Composite materials will be considered.

As for the motor control unit, it will be very innovative, Ybanez says. While magnetic resonance imaging and particle accelerators use superconductivity to create strong magnetic fields, aviation will target an increase in power density. The weight of the wiring (which recently has used aluminum) will thus no longer be correlated to the power it carries.

The motor will be compatible with a propeller, a fan or an unspecified hybrid propeller, Airbus says. The first three pillars of Ascend will be working on the motor itself, the motor control unit and the cryogenic system. The fourth pillar will be network safety and protection, including fault current limiters and circuit breakers.

While hydrogen is the presumed cold source, the 15-engineer Ascend team also will consider creating a different one in an electrically powered aircraft that would not rely on hydrogen. Ascend will study power levels in the 1-4-megawatt range and evaluate the benefits of introducing superconductivity and the accompanying cryogenics. The applications would potentially cover a wide spectrum, from a small electric vertical-takeoff-and-landing vehicle to a long-range commercial aircraft.

At the end of the program, the Ascend team will issue recommendations so that Airbus can make decisions about electric propulsion architectures.

Safran soon will become a partner in Ascend, along with other companies and research laboratories.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999873161315918}",neutral,0.999873161315918,0

Pontifications: Southwest didn't invite Airbus to bid - Leeham News and Analysis,"Mon, 05 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNC8wNS9wb250aWZpY2F0aW9ucy1zb3V0aHdlc3QtZGlkbnQtaW52aXRlLWFpcmJ1cy10by1iaWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"April 5, 2021, © Leeham News: Southwest Airlines didn’t ask Airbus to submit a commercial bid for the A220-300, three knowledgeable sources tell Leeham News.

Southwest conducted an internal technical analysis of the A220-300 vs. the 737-7 MAX. The A220-300 offered better economics. But this competed against the costs of retaining a common 737 fleet.

“Southwest acknowledged the merits of the A220, but there was no competition” for a commercially-based bid, LNA is told.

The airline placed an order on March 29 for 100 737-7s. Southwest said the order was an outgrowth of talks with Boeing for compensation due to the 20-month grounding of the MAX.

Southwest’s own words

In its press release, Southwest announced “the completion of its previously disclosed discussions with Boeing regarding the restructuring of its delivery schedule for MAX aircraft. The Company has completed the multi-year evaluation of the successor aircraft to its Boeing 737-700 model, with the selection of the Boeing 737 MAX 7 aircraft. Southwest Airlines® and Boeing reached agreement on 100 firm orders for MAX 7 aircraft, with the first 30 scheduled to be delivered in 2022.”

Southwest also said, “We now estimate contractual aircraft capital spending for all years 2021 through 2026, which consists of 169 MAX firm orders with Boeing (135 MAX 7 and 34 MAX 8 aircraft), to be approximately $5.1bn. Our estimated contractual aircraft capital spending remains immaterial in 2021 and is expected to be approximately $700m in 20223. We continue to estimate 2021 capital expenditures to be no more than $500 million, driven primarily by technology, facilities, and operational investments.”

Southwest footnoted this statement. The capital expenditures are “Net of progress payments made on undelivered MAX aircraft and previously agreed upon delivery credits provided by Boeing to the Company due to the settlement of 2020 estimated damages relating to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounding of the 737 MAX aircraft.”

Boeing, in its press release, outlined services provided in the contract. ”

As part of the agreement, Southwest will also expand its use of Boeing’s digital solutions to support its 737 MAX fleet, including Airplane Health Management, Maintenance Performance Toolbox and digital navigation charting tools. Boeing will also provide system software upgrades and new wireless communications-enabling equipment to support Southwest’s operations.”

These services are likely either free or sharply discounted as part of the grounding compensation.

Airplane costs

Southwest’s press release infers a $30m per-plane price for the MAX 7, excluding previously paid deposits and progress payments on the MAX 8. Seventy MAX 8 orders were swapped to the MAX 7.

However, Boeing previously paid Southwest nearly $500m in cash compensation because of the grounding. This likely offsets deposits and progress payments.

Southwest will receive 30 MAXes next year. The financial figures suggest Southwest will pay only $23m per plane upon delivery, allowing for deposits and progress payments.

Boeing’s financial terms and compensation due Southwest made it impossible for Airbus to match even if invited to bid. Furthermore, Airbus’ sales philosophy changed since the 2018 retirement of John Leahy as COO-Customers.

The aggressive Leahy was often willing to pursue creative deals to break Boeing’s incumbency. (Leahy’s willingness had limits, however. He never seriously pursued a deal with Ryanair, a rock-solid Boeing customer.)

But under his successor, Christian Scherer, Airbus is less willing to drop prices to rock-bottom levels to win a deal. Scherer is known to see the A320 and A220 families as more technologically advanced than the 737. He has noted these aircraft still have growth opportunities, while the 737 is maxed out. A stretched A220-500 and an “A322” or A321 Plus-Plus designs are on the shelf, waiting to go when the time is right. The A220-500 is a question of when, not if, a person close to the situation tells LNA.

Taking a page from decades-long messaging by Boeing, Scherer believes Airbus can command a premium over Boeing.

Maintaining price

Scherer was unwilling to drop the price of the A321neo to levels requested by Alaska Airlines in the recent competition. Alaska, also due compensation from Boeing over the MAX grounding, placed an exclusive order with Boeing. Future 737-9s will replace the A319s/320s remaining from the 2016 Virgin America acquisition. Only A321neos stay in the fleet.

Alaska still has 30 orders from Virgin for A320neos. Alaska said it won’t take delivery of these. The order can be canceled with a loss of $15m in deposits. But it’s still possible some of these orders might be swapped into A321neos, an airplane Alaska likes.

Airbus commercial aircraft earnings improve over first quarter - Flightglobal,"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWVyb3NwYWNlL2FpcmJ1cy1jb21tZXJjaWFsLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWVhcm5pbmdzLWltcHJvdmUtb3Zlci1maXJzdC1xdWFydGVyLzE0MzUyMS5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus’s commercial aircraft earnings improved over the first quarter, despite a 4% fall in revenues for the division.

The airframer turned in EBIT earnings of €343 million ($416 million) for the three months to 31 March, on revenues of €7.27 billion.

Its adjusted EBIT reached €533 million, compared with the figure of €191 million recorded in the first quarter of 2020.

Airbus says this mainly reflects “focus on cost” as well as a “favourable” mix of deliveries, adding that it benefited from positive currency hedging effects.

The airframer delivered 125 commercial aircraft over the quarter – comprising 10 A350s, one A330, 105 A320-family jets and nine A220s – slightly higher than the 122 achieved last year.

Commercial aircraft revenues dipped mainly due to “lower volume in services”, says the airframer.

Chief executive Guillaume Faury says the “good” quarterly performance for the company as a whole is the result not only of commercial aircraft activity but also cost and cash containment, progress with restructuring, and positive contributions from its helicopter, defence and space businesses.

“The first quarter shows that the crisis is not yet over for our industry,” he warns. “The market remains uncertain.

“We are investing in innovation and in the transformation of our company to deliver on our long-term ambitions across the portfolio.”

Although Airbus recorded 39 commercial aircraft orders over the quarter, cancellations meant it ended the period with a net order deficit of 61.

Financial adjustments of €232 million for the period included a €29 million charge relating to A380 programme costs and €177 million related to the dollar pre-delivery payment mismatch and balance sheet revaluation.

Airbus is aiming to achieve the same number of commercial aircraft deliveries this year as it managed in 2020.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999996423721313}",positive,0.9999996423721313,1
"The launch of a unique, worldwide project: Lufthansa Airbus A350-900 ""Erfurt"" becomes climate research aircraft - Lufthansa Group","Thu, 08 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiywFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sdWZ0aGFuc2Fncm91cC5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbWVkaWEtcmVsYXRpb25zLW5vcnRoLWFtZXJpY2EvbmV3cy1hbmQtcmVsZWFzZXMvdGhlLWxhdW5jaC1vZi1hLXVuaXF1ZS13b3JsZHdpZGUtcHJvamVjdC1sdWZ0aGFuc2EtYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAtOTAwLWVyZnVydC1iZWNvbWVzLWNsaW1hdGUtcmVzZWFyY2gtYWlyY3JhZnQuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Previous Next

Predicting the weather more accurately, analyzing climate change more precisely and researching how the world is developing in a more precise manner is the main goal of a unique, global cooperation between Lufthansa and several research institutes.

Converting a plane into a climate research aircraft poses major challenges. For this reason, Lufthansa chose the most modern and economical long-haul jet in its fleet - an Airbus A350-900 named ""Erfurt"" (registration D-AIXJ). In three stages, the ""Erfurt"" will now become a flying research laboratory.

In Lufthansa Technik's hangar in Malta, the first and most extensive conversion work was carried out. Preparations were made for a complex air intake system below the belly. This was followed by a series of test insertions, at the end of which came the certification of a climate research laboratory weighing around 1.6 tons, the so-called CARIBIC measurement laboratory. The acronym CARIBIC stands for ""Civil Aircraft for the Regular Investigation of the atmosphere Based on an Instrument Container"". The project is part of a comprehensive European research consortium.

The ""Erfurt"" is expected to take off from Munich at the end of 2021 for its first flight in the service of climate research, measuring around 100 different trace gases, aerosol and cloud parameters in the tropopause region (at an altitude of nine to twelve kilometers). Therefore, Lufthansa is making a valuable contribution to climate research, which can use these unique data to assess the performance of current atmospheric and climate models and thus their predictive power for the Earth's future climate. The special feature: Climate-relevant parameters can be recorded at this altitude with much greater accuracy and temporal resolution on board the aircraft than with satellite-based or ground-based systems.

""The conversion of our A350-900 'D-AIXJ' into a climate research aircraft is something very special for us. We were immediately enthusiastic about the plan to continue CARIBIC on our most fuel-efficient aircraft type. In this way, we can continue to support climate and atmospheric research in its important task on long-haul routes. We are helping to ensure that particularly important climate-relevant parameters are collected just on that altitude where the atmospheric greenhouse effects are largely generated,"" said Annette Mann, Head of Corporate Responsibility at the Lufthansa Group. ""I am pleased that we can implement this ambitious project together with our partners in record time and thus contribute to improving today's climate models.""

The A350 conversion, which has now been launched, was preceded by an extremely elaborate planning and development phase of about four years involving more than ten companies (in particular Lufthansa, Lufthansa Technik, Airbus, Safran, enviscope, and Dynatec), as well as the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), as representative of a larger scientific consortium.

""The CARIBIC aircraft is indeed unique in the world. It is equipped with high-end instrumentation comparable to that on a large research aircraft and it allows their deployment cost-efficiently, regularly and over decades. We can thus understand which processes are changing, to what extent and how they will influence Earth’s climate in the future,"" said Dr Andreas Zahn of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and coordinator of IAGOS-CARIBIC. ""No other observation system worldwide, neither on ground nor on satellite, can provide such high-resolution multi-parameter data from the free atmosphere.""

The Lufthansa Group has been a reliable partner of climate research since 1994 and has since equipped several aircraft with special instruments. This is now the first time, worldwide, on an Airbus A350-900 aircraft.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9977385997772217}",neutral,0.9977385997772217,0
Airbus takes note from migratory birds in ‘fello’fly’ fuel efficiency project - Skies Magazine,"Tue, 06 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZXNtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLW1pZ3JhdG9yeS1iaXJkcy1mZWxsb2ZseS1mdWVsLWVmZmljaWVuY3ktcHJvamVjdC_SAVZodHRwczovL3NraWVzbWFnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1taWdyYXRvcnktYmlyZHMtZmVsbG9mbHktZnVlbC1lZmZpY2llbmN5LXByb2plY3QvP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Ken Pole | April 6, 2021 Ken Pole |

Estimated reading time 10 minutes, 35 seconds.

The Canada goose, although native to North America, can be found worldwide these days. Airbus, a much larger breed officially native to Toulouse in southern France, also is found worldwide, albeit in smaller flocks than Branta canadensis.

While infamous for its fecal carpet bombing in and around its migratory staging areas, the Canada goose is famous for its V-shaped flight formations which can log up to 2,400 kilometers (1,490 miles) in 24 hours. While their migration altitude tends to be about one km, they have been reported as high as nine km (5.5 mi).

Meanwhile, the latest Airbus platforms — clean-sheet designs largely made of composites — fly much longer distances at higher speeds, even as manufacturers push for more flight efficiency, a lighter fuel burn and, increasingly critical, a reduced environmental footprint.

Aviation, however, evidently can learn a thing or two from geese when it comes to efficiencies. Their close-V migratory formations in spring and fall are led by a single bird, but that role as flock leader — which burns tremendous energy — is regularly rotated, programmed into the birds’ DNA. The trailing geese conserve energy by effectively “surfing” the invisible upwash of smooth air from the flapping wings of the birds ahead. Another analogy would be glider pilots riding heat thermals to gain altitude.

Enter Nick Macdonald, a British expatriate who has a master’s degree in physics from Imperial College in London, and who has logged some 600 hours since acquiring his European private licence at the age of 17. With a self-described “passion for innovation and people,” he has been with Airbus since 2002, currently as fello’fly project leader.

Macdonald’s previous role involved overseeing support for an array of Airbus Asia-Pacific operators. Now based in Toulouse, he heads the company’s fello’fly demonstrator program which aims to prove the technical, operational, and economic viability of “wake-energy retrieval” for commercial aircraft. It effectively would use evolving technology to seamlessly mimic what the Canada goose does naturally.

“This is not a crazy science project,” he told Skies. “This is real technology that we’re putting into play in the flight testing that we’ve done recently. It’s very encouraging.” Long before it reached the in-flight stage, it was developed and tested on multiple simulation platforms of all sizes.



Geese, which fly in V-shaped migratory formations, conserve energy by “surfing” the invisible upwash of smooth air from the flapping wings of the birds ahead. Airbus is aiming to use this “wake-energy retrieval” method with commercial aircraft. Airbus Images

He said Airbus’s initial collaboration with two commercial carriers and various air navigation service providers (ANSPs) — such as Nav Canada and its counterparts in Britain and Europe — could make a significant impact on aircraft environmental performance, mainly by reducing fuel burn.

The two carriers involved are SAS Airlines, the Danish-Norwegian-Swedish flag carrier which has 134 mostly Airbus models serving a global network; and French Bee (formerly French Blue), a Paris-based discount long-hauler with four Airbus A350-900s. Macdonald said their operational differences have given his team an opportunity to explore a range of scenarios.

Similar to geese, commercial aircraft produce upwash and downwash. “If you position a following aircraft close to that wake, it can . . . retrieve that energy from the upwash,” Macdonald explained. “Then you can basically reduce the angle of attack of the following aircraft, reduce the engine setting, and therefore save on fuel. Fello’fly is basically, above all, a sustainability project.

“We believe we can save between five and 10 percent fuel for the following aircraft on a long haul,” he continued, noting that aircraft technical developments providing even one to two percent less fuel burn are significant for a commercial platform. Moreover, Airbus is targetting further “minimal technical changes,” which it expects to prove with its heavily-instrumented A350 flight test aircraft.

Before fello’fly was launched, Airbus showed that when flying manually behind one of the company’s large A380s, the A350 crew found that fuel burn was actually reduced by more than 10 percent, and that the flight was comfortable. “Fello’fly is designed to take it to the next level, to come up with a solution that is really integrated into the aircraft’s auto-flight features.”

Airbus is collaborating with French Bee, a Paris-based discount long-hauler with four Airbus A350-900s, on this project, as well as with SAS Airlines and various air navigation service providers. Alvin Man Photo

Asked whether other manufacturers were buying into the concept, he acknowledged “a certain amount of engagement” in following Airbus’s lead. “With the demonstrator that we’re using today [as recently as late March 2021], we’re really making good progress on demonstrating the feasibility.” A recent test in French airspace off the Atlantic coast involved automatic tracking of a wake vortex.

Except for contrails, which are mainly ice crystals, vortices are generally invisible to the naked eye. “We’re looking to put in place a solution where, with or without contrails, you can safely identify, capture, and track the vortex in cruise phases. . . . That’s why we feel that fello’fly is really suited to longer haul flights. The longer the aircraft track together and the longer the following aircraft can retrieve that energy from the leading aircraft, the greater the fuel savings and the environmental benefit.”

Asked then whether fello’fly isn’t somewhat counterintuitive to most pilots, given all the instruction and rules about vertical and horizontal separation, Macdonald replied that Airbus has been testing at three km (1.9 mi) with one aircraft trailing another. “We’re not talking wingtip-to-wingtip . . . formation flying like in fast military jets. . . . You can see the lead aircraft but it’s a long way off . . . and despite that you still have this energy in the vortex which can be utilized. Ultimately, the features that we’re designing and flight testing will be such that they will keep the aircraft where it needs to be: the optimal fuel burn position.”

While onboard technologies continue to be refined, the next key step would be “live trials” in controlled transatlantic airspace toward the end of 2021, but some regulatory changes will be required for commercial service.

Macdonald explained that in addition to working with the ANSPs, Airbus is working with the Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organization, to which it made a presentation late last year. “Regulations do need to be revised,” he said. “That’s really where the name comes from; fello’fly is a fellowship, working together.

“What we’re saying within Airbus is that we are working on this technology. We want to bring it to the industry; we need everybody to work together, to work globally, to prepare a regulatory framework, an air traffic framework. It’s not just about the onboard technology, but also how the industry embraces the change.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999771118164062}",neutral,0.9999771118164062,0

The VSR700 is an unmanned aerial system being developed for the French Navy in partnership with Naval Group. This order (which also includes an for eight additional H225M CSAR helicopters for the Air Force) is part of a Stimulus plan to support the national aeronautical industry announced by the French government in 2020.

“We are very thankful to the French government for their support of the aeronautical industry through the Stimulus plan. This is a win-win situation as the aircraft fulfill a real operational need for the French armed forces and this order allows Airbus Helicopters to secure jobs and key skills in the medium term […] The VSR700 is also a crucial programme. It will provide the French Navy with a highly capable autonomous platform and it will pave the way for future unmanned systems within the Airbus Helicopters portfolio.”



Bruno Even, Airbus Helicopters CEO

Like the rest of the aeronautical industry, the helicopter industry has been impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. 2020 saw the worldwide market decrease by 50%. The support of the French government will help secure 960 jobs during the next three years for Airbus Helicopters and its suppliers.

Designed to operate alongside other shipborne naval assets, the VSR700 unmanned aerial system (UAS) is being developed within the frame of the SDAM (Système de drone aérien de la Marine) programme for the French Navy. The VSR700 is an unmanned aerial system in the 500-1000 kg maximum take-off weight range derived from Hélicoptères Guimbal’s Cabri G2. According to Airbus Helicopters, It offers the best balance of payload capability, endurance and operational cost. It is capable of carrying multiple full-size naval sensors for extended periods and can operate from existing ships, alongside a helicopter, with a low logistical footprint.

The first prototype of the VSR700 performed its maiden flight in 2020 and has recently begun expanding its flight envelope.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9906264543533325}",neutral,0.9906264543533325,0

Airbus teams have reached an important milestone in the production of the A321XLR with the delivery to Hamburg, Germany of the first Centre Wing Box.

T

he Airbus teams in Nantes, France, delivered the very first A321XLR’s Centre Wing Box (CWB), 16 months after machining the first metal cuts. This is an important moment for the Nantes teams and for the programme, as the CWB is one of the first major components delivered to the Hamburg integrator site for the start of structural assembly activities for the center fuselage known as “Section 15” in the A320 Family.

A significant challenge

At a very early stage in the Airbus production cycle, the CWB - the structural heart of the aircraft and a speciality of the Nantes site - represents a significant challenge in terms of planning execution: “The CWB is always the first major component on each new aircraft development to be produced so we must mature its design very early and manage its interdependencies with fuel systems, load calculations, as well as physical interfaces to the airframe aerostructure components developed in France, Germany and the UK,” explain Yannick Valette, Integrated Product Team Nose & Forward Fuselage (IPT NFF) A321XLR Programme Leader, and Richard Hue, CWB Project Leader.



Over 200 modifications

To support the increased maximum take-off weight (MTOW) capability of the A321XLR, parts of the CWB are reinforced, such as the spars, frames and upper and lower panels. Fuel system components have also been added to the CWB to allow the supply of fuel to the new Rear Centre Tank (RCT) integrated into the fuselage in Hamburg, which provides the A321XLR with an increased fuel capacity of around 12,900 litres, giving a total maximum capacity of 40,000 litres on the aircraft.



Nantes employees in action

Next steps

Delivered by Beluga to the Hamburg site, the CWB will be integrated together with Section 15 (the RCT Flange-Module) into the front part of the Center-Aft-Fuselage (CAF), hereby launching the start of assembly for the main components of this first aircraft in the dedicated H260 “Structure Pilot Line” in Hamburg. Meanwhile, in Nantes, the next two CWBs, which are intended for the flight test aircraft, are already being assembled. Looking further ahead, the CWB for the first customer-delivered aircraft is planned to enter production in Q4 2021.

The A321XLR’s entry into service is planned in 2023.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8179841041564941}",neutral,0.8179841041564941,0

Airbus has reaffirmed its intention to build a stronger aerostructures assembly value chain across its industrial system to its social partners, and considers aerostructures assembly as core to its business. Airbus presented its plans to create two integrated aerostructures assembly companies at the heart of its industrial system in order to reinforce its value stream management and prepare the Company for its short- and long-term future.

As part of these plans, and upon successful completion of the ongoing social process, the new company in France would bring together the activities currently managed within Airbus in Saint-Nazaire and Nantes together with those of STELIA Aerospace worldwide. Another company in Germany would bring the activities of Stade and Structure Assembly of Hamburg together with those of Premium AEROTEC in Nordenham, Bremen and partly in Augsburg, while rebalancing activities towards the upper part of the value chain and reviewing its involvement in the manufacturing of detail parts.

These two new aerostructures assembly companies, both wholly owned by Airbus, would no longer be suppliers to Airbus but become integrated within the Airbus perimeter, simplifying both governance and interfaces in a new industrial setup. Their distinct status would also enable them to focus on their industry segment and be leaner and more agile, fostering competitiveness, innovation and quality to the benefit of the Airbus programmes of today and tomorrow.

Airbus also intends to create a new global player in the detail parts business, anchored in Germany. Born out of today’s Premium AEROTEC, this new entity, with its scale and advanced technologies, would be empowered to capitalise on the significant long-term growth prospects with Airbus as well as external customers, on both civil and military platforms.

In Spain, Airbus continues to work on solutions with its social partners to optimise the current industrial and aerostructures set-up in the Cádiz area in order to ensure its viability, resilience and competitiveness for the future.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9962195754051208}",positive,0.9962195754051208,1

Friedrichshafen, 27 April 2021 – JUICE, the JUpiter ICy moons Explorer mission led by the European Space Agency (ESA), has left Airbus’ satellite integration centre in Friedrichshafen (Germany) and is now on its way to the Large Space Simulator (LSS) chamber of the European Space Agency (ESA) in Noordwijk (Netherlands) for its first taste of space. Over the next 12 months, starting with 31 days in the vacuum chamber in the LSS, the spacecraft will be exposed to the environmental conditions of space and will have to prove it is ready for its journey via Venus and Mars to Jupiter and its mission in the Jovian system.



Since its arrival 12 months ago at the Airbus site, JUICE has been kitted out with its final components including harness, power electronics, on-board computer, communication systems, navigation sensors, thermal hardware and crucially its scientific instruments. At the ESA test centre at ESTEC in Noordwijk, the spacecraft will undergo a full environmental test campaign including verifying its thermal control system and its electrical elements.

Together with their ESA colleagues, a total of 120 Airbus space engineers and subcontractors will prepare and carry out the tests. In July this year, the spacecraft will head for Airbus in Toulouse for flight configuration assembly, before the final environmental tests including electro-magnetic compatibility (EMC), mechanical, deployment, and propulsion. It will then be shipped to the launch site in Kourou, French Guiana.

The 6.2 ton JUICE spacecraft will set off in 2022 on its near 600 million-kilometre-long journey to Jupiter. The spacecraft will carry 10 state-of-the-art scientific instruments, including cameras, spectrometers, an ice-penetrating radar, an altimeter, radio-science experiment, and sensors to monitor the magnetic fields and charged particles in the Jovian system. JUICE will complete a unique tour of the Jupiter system that will include in-depth studies of three potentially ocean-bearing moons with liquid water, Ganymede, Europa and Callisto.

JUICE will spend more than three years in the Jupiter system, collecting data to provide answers on the conditions for planet formation and the emergence of life. It will spend nine months orbiting the icy moon Ganymede analysing its nature and evolution, and its potential habitability.

As prime contractor, Airbus is leading an industrial consortium of more than 80 companies across Europe.

Airbus and Dassault Aviation have reached an accord on building a test version of Europe's next-generation fighter jet, after weeks of strained negotiations that put the plane's development in doubt, sources close to the project said Friday.

The companies are the pillars of a Future Combat Air System (FCAS) meant to prove the Continent's ability to integrate its disparate defense forces and increase its military sovereignty.

A previous French-German plan to build a common fighter failed, leading to the development of the Rafale and Eurofighter jets currently in use.

But progress on the new delta-wing stealth jet has been plagued by fighting over the sharing of the industrial work as well as intellectual property for the cutting-edge technologies.

France, Germany and Spain, the three countries involved in the program, ""have received the offer from the companies for the construction of a demonstrator of the future combat jet,"" a French defense ministry official said.

Talks on hammering out accords on the several contracts outstanding for the ambitious project ""are still underway between the companies and the states involved,"" the official added.

Dassault of France and Airbus, the pan-European planemaker representing the German and Spanish interests, declined to comment.

French lawmakers warned this month that time was running out to move forward on the plane and its associated drones and network technologies, expected to cost 50 to 80 billion euros ($60-$95 billion), for it to be operational as expected by 2040.

Dassault is leading the jet development, but Airbus executives have bristled at being treated as a subcontractor instead of a full-fledged partner, and want a larger role in key elements of the work.

Yet Dassault has insisted on its industry expertise in fighter jets, pointing to its Mirage and Rafale planes, that it does not want to see exploited by a rival.

Airbus, for its part, is spearheading the development of the drones and the ""combat cloud"" ultrafast communications network that will use artificial intelligence capabilities.

So far, no other EU nations have signed on to build the new plane.

Several European governments are already clients of American fighter jets, while Britain's Tempest stealth fighter project has garnered backing from Italy and the Netherlands.

The airline, which is the largest customer of the type, is currently waiting for the last five A380 deliveries.

This will be the last-ever produced Super Jumbo, as the manufacturer together with Emirates, announced that the carrier would reduce the backlog of the A380 by 39 aircraft on February 14, 2019. Citing no substantial backlog and no basis to sustain production as a result of the backlog shrink, the European manufacturer indicated that 2021 would be the end of the road for the production of the double-decker on the same day.

In total, Emirates had 123 Airbus A380 aircraft on order, Airbus Orders & Deliveries data shows, while the total number of produced aircraft of the type will be 251.

While the future was already bleak prior to the current pandemic for the Super Jumbo, the current downturn in demand for international travel has delivered a knockout punch for the aircraft. Many operators of the jet, including Air France and Lufthansa made the decision to retire their A380s prematurely as a result of the ongoing uncertainty regarding international travel.

However, not all hope is lost – several other airlines, including British Airways, Emirates and Qantas still see a future for the double-decker on some routes into the future, so there will still be opportunities to see one in the skies.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.7699633240699768}",negative,0.7699633240699768,-1

While the magic of electronic vertical takeoff and landing has captured the public imagination, he said during a Helicopter Association International webinar that it could be decades before that rabbit comes out of the hat.

“We have to learn,” he said, “and hopefully we are going to find a game-changing technology, which I don’t see today.”

Trapp’s concern centers on safety, noting that it’s far easier to fly an autonomous aircraft in isolation versus in crowded airspace, and “sense and avoid” is still beyond the horizon. “The technology is not there yet, and the regulatory environment has not even been defined. And for good reason. At the end of the day, we still have a long way to go to be able to do so.”

Autonomous operations are often considered best suited for the so-called “Three Ds—” Dirty, Dangerous and Dull. These would include monitoring toxic waste sites, flying low-level search missions in bad weather and/or hazardous terrain, and monotonous pipeline or powerline patrol.

Trapp sees eVTOL as a future partner to conventional helicopters rather than a replacement. For example, search-and-rescue operations will continue to be flown by manned helicopters, in his view, citing the complexity of hoist operations as one reason.

But that’s not to say Airbus isn’t committed to research in the air-mobility arena. Its City Airbus demonstrator and Vahana research aircraft project have advanced the technology in their own ways. “We have invested a lot of money and will continue to do so,” Trapp said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9987688660621643}",neutral,0.9987688660621643,0

The A380 proposal, on the other hand, would convert the passenger-only double-decker aircraft into a Combi (combined passenger-freight carrier), with cargo occupying the main deck.

Manufacturer offers temporary freight solution for passenger cabins

Global cargo demand is on the rise but capacity is still squeezed

“As a leading aircraft manufacturer we’re always looking at ways to add value for customers,” says an Airbus spokesman. “There are many studies, and not all of them see the light of day.”

The A350 move, in particular, could provide a valuable boost to the Airbus product range, which since the termination of A300/A310 production has failed to match Boeing’s success in the widebody cargo sector. Sales of the A330-200F appear to have dried up, with no orders in the current backlog beyond the 38 already delivered. Demand for the A330 passenger-to-freighter conversion has picked up, however, and a modification program developed by the Airbus and ST Aerospace joint venture Elbe Flugzeugwerke is enjoying success.

The A330 main deck is much smaller than that of the 777F which can accommodate 27 standard 96 X 125 in. cargo pallets. The A330-200F has room for up to 23 pallets. The A350-950F would presumably have room for more.

The proposed -950F derivative is sized between the larger A350-1000 and the smaller A350-900. According to industry sources the new variant will incorporate a new forward fuselage plug with a cargo door and local structural strengthening. The proposed hybrid aircraft, which is believed to be around 230 ft. in overall length compared to 219 ft. for the A350-900 and 242.1 ft. for the A350-1000, would utilize the larger variant’s six-wheel main landing gear design and higher-thrust Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 engines.

According to suppliers briefed on the project, which was first disclosed by Reuters in March, the A350 derivative could enter service early in the second half of the decade if formally launched by year-end.

Although Airbus first proposed a freighter variant of the A350 in 2007, shortly after the launch of the new airliner program, this early derivative was configured with a performance similar to the MD-11F. Its development was deferred to give priority to the passenger models. Compared to the initial offering, the updated -950F would offer greater range and payload capability, and could enable Airbus to compete more effectively both with Boeing’s popular 777-200LR-based design as well as provide growth to match the 777-8F.

News of the Airbus A350-950F study also comes as the air cargo market emerges with brighter demand prospects in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and a global surge in e-commerce. Through an otherwise dismal 2020, the freight market provided Boeing with one of its few bright spots: Of the 26 777s delivered last year, 22 were freighters.

Cargo operators are experiencing a severe capacity shortage, with many long-haul passenger flights still grounded because of pandemic-related travel restrictions.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) says global air cargo demand rose 9% in February compared to the pre-pandemic levels of February 2019. It also rose 1.5% month-over-month from January, and volumes have returned to the 2018 levels seen prior to the U.S.-China trade war, IATA says. However, capacity fell 14.9% compared to February 2019, due to tightening travel restrictions and capacity cuts on the passenger side, IATA says.

Airbus has come up with a short-term answer to that cargo capacity squeeze. In the OEM’s temporary passenger cabin-conversion system the seats are removed and the cabin is adapted to safely and efficiently carry cargo in the cabin: 30 pallets (about 7.8 metric tons) of cargo for the A350 and 28 pallets (7.3 metric tons) for the A330. This solution is already in use by airlines. South Korea’s Asiana Airlines was the first to put it into operation on an A350 last September, transporting information technology and electronic equipment, as well as e-commerce exports such as clothing, from Seoul to Los Angeles.

But operators want longer-term solutions beyond these “preighter” aircraft, and Airbus has also taken note of Boeing’s relative success in other cargo sectors. Boeing delivered 30 of the 767F variants last year, including military tanker versions, compared to 43 in 2019 and 27 in 2018. Deliveries of the 747-8F, which will be phased out of production in 2022, also continued at a slow rate: five were handed over to UPS last year, three of them in the last quarter. Overall, Boeing delivered 46 commercial freighter versions of the 767, 777 and 747-8 in 2020, representing a record 40% of the overall 114 widebody deliveries last year.

Airbus appears to be equally encouraged by Boeing’s freight sector forecast, which in November 2020 predicted air cargo traffic would double over the next two decades, triggering a demand for around 2,430 new-production and converted freighters. Of these, around 1,080 will be single-aisle conversions, with the balance made up of 480 new-build medium widebodies, 420 widebody conversions and 450 new-build large widebody freighters.

In its last pre-pandemic global market forecast issued in 2019, Airbus predicted similar overall numbers, but was more circumspect about the outlook for large freighters (80 metric tons payload and over) through 2038. While Airbus predicted a market for 850 new-build freighters over the next 20 years, it believed only 350 would be in the large category, with the balance—some 500 aircraft—in the medium (40-80 metric tons) sector. Whether these numbers will change for the first post-pandemic forecast remains unclear.

Few details have been released about the proposed A380 Combi, news of which was first reported by the cargo news website freightwaves.com. The modification, which is believed to be an attempt to help current mainline A380 operators tap into the e-commerce market, would retain the existing upper-deck seating for passengers and provide cargo space on the main deck only.

The proposed modification could conceivably inject new life into the flagging A380 program, which is coming to an end after the first flight of the final aircraft from Toulouse on March 17. The Combi initiative partially revives elements of the original A380F design, which was ultimately dropped after orders from Fedex and UPS were canceled in 2006 and 2007, respectively.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996659755706787}",neutral,0.9996659755706787,0
"Airbus, and not Boeing, qualifies for RCAF future tanker - Skies Magazine","Fri, 02 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZXNtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWJvZWluZy1xdWFsaWZpZXMtcmNhZi1mdXR1cmUtdGFua2VyL9IBSWh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZXNtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWJvZWluZy1xdWFsaWZpZXMtcmNhZi1mdXR1cmUtdGFua2VyLz9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Chris Thatcher | April 2, 2021 Chris Thatcher |

Estimated reading time 4 minutes, 44 seconds.

Only one bidder has qualified so far to provide the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) with its next strategic transport and air-to-air refueling aircraft.

Public Services and Procurement Canada (PSPC) on April 1 released a list of qualified suppliers to participate in the next phases of the RCAF’s Strategic Tanker Transport Capability (STTC) project, and only Airbus Defence and Space and its A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) made the cut.

Boeing and the KC-46 Pegasus, a militarized variant of the 767 widebody, was informed the aircraft did not qualify for the project to replace the current fleet of five CC-150 Polaris aircraft.

The decision does not entirely eliminate the KC-46 from future consideration. In posting the qualified supplier list, PSPC said the government “may, at its sole discretion, re-open” the invitation to qualify phase and share documents with any new entrants.

In a statement, Boeing said it was disappointed with the decision, but “we will remain ready to bring the full depth and breadth of Boeing to our offer in the event Canada decides to reopen the bidding process.”

The company noted that the “KC-46 offers superior interoperability, supportability, and affordability along with a robust industry plan that would bring real, guaranteed jobs to companies all across Canada. With 183 aircraft on order and growing international interest, we expect the global fleet to surpass 200 aircraft by 2029.”

Airbus has offered the A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) aircraft, which the company called “the only new generation, combat- proven, multirole tanker available.”

“It is certified to operate with the majority of western receivers, including Canada’s current fighters, transport, and mission aircraft,” Simon Jacques, president of Airbus Defence and Space Canada, said in a statement.

The A330 MRTT has over 250,000 flight hours with 13 nations, “including key NATO allies and Five Eyes partners such as Australia and the United Kingdom,” he noted.

The government’s invitation to qualify was issued on Feb. 12 to identify respondents able to meet the STTC project’s security and other core requirements before moving to the tender phase. Only qualified suppliers will be invited to participate in workshops and one-on-one sessions to refine the aircraft requirement and respond to an eventual request for proposals to be issued by fall 2021.

The RCAF is seeking a multi-role platform that can be configured for air-to-air refueling, personnel airlift, strategic government transport, aeromedical evacuations, and freight movement, among other roles. The aircraft may also be used to support disaster relief, search-and-rescue and contributions to peace operations; it must also include the capacity to detect, avoid, and defeat air-to-air and ground-to-air threats. In its tanker role, the aircraft must be able to refuel allied fighter jets on NATO and NORAD operations.

The current fleet of CC-150s, a modified variant of the Airbus A310-300, were acquired in 1992 from Canadian Airlines, and two were converted to tankers in 2008. The fleet is operated by 437 Transport Squadron at 8 Wing Trenton, Ontario.

The government has engaged BDO Canada as a fairness monitor for the procurement, PSPC said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999328851699829}",neutral,0.9999328851699829,0
Airbus switching A320neo family from mechanical to electronic rudder control - Flightglobal,"Wed, 07 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mbGlnaHRnbG9iYWwuY29tL2Fpci10cmFuc3BvcnQvYWlyYnVzLXN3aXRjaGluZy1hMzIwbmVvLWZhbWlseS1mcm9tLW1lY2hhbmljYWwtdG8tZWxlY3Ryb25pYy1ydWRkZXItY29udHJvbC8xNDMyMDMuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is aiming to replace the mechanical rudder controls on A320neo-family aircraft, switching to a full electric rudder system by early 2024.

The modification will coincide with the entry into service of the long-range A321XLR which is being developed with the ‘E-rudder’ architecture in mind.

While the initial delivery had been intended at the end of this year, with an A320neo powered by CFM International Leap-1A engines, Airbus says it is “reviewing the introduction scenario” given the disruption from the pandemic.

The E-rudder will become standard on the A319neo, A320neo and A321neo range. But it will not be fitted to conventional A320-family jets, nor will it be available as a retrofit.

Under the current A320 and A320neo fly-by-wire architecture, seven computers – two flight-augmentation computers, two elevator-aileron computers, and three spoiler-elevator computers – handle the flight-control surfaces.

But although the flight-augmentation computers provide input for yaw damping, rudder travel limit and trim, the rudder system retains mechanical linkages between the pedals in the cockpit and the hydraulic rudder actuators.

The E-rudder programme will replace the mechanical interface with an electrical one, saving some 40kg in weight by enable the removal of several fixtures and three computer units.

Both flight-augmentation computers and one of the spoiler-elevator computers will be withdrawn, along with the yaw-damper and rudder-trim actuators, and the travel limiter unit.

Conversion to the E-rudder system involves installing a new rudder-pedal unit in the cockpit, new rudder-position sensors, and a back-up control module.

The rudder will be controlled through the two elevator-aileron computers, for normal law, and the two remaining spoiler-elevator computers, plus the back-up module, in direct law.

Airbus will also reconfigure control of the inboard spoilers, which were previously tied to the third spoiler-elevator computer.

The primary flight-control computers will have updated hardware and software, and software changes will be made to several others, while the rudder-actuation systems will be modified.

“Ramp-up will be done over 2023 to standardise E-rudder by early 2024,” says Airbus, adding that the simpler system will save fuel and reduce maintenance costs.

Suppliers including Thales, Safran, Collins and Liebherr are participating in the equipment updates for the programme. Airbus adds that no relocation of the computers in the avionics bay will be necessary.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999831914901733}",neutral,0.9999831914901733,0
Cool: Kyrgyzstan's Air Manas Acquires Airbus A220 - One Mile at a Time,"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vb25lbWlsZWF0YXRpbWUuY29tL2Fpci1tYW5hcy1hMjIwL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As someone who is a big fan of the ‘Stans (or a stan of the ‘Stans, as the kids would say nowadays), this is kind of awesome…

Air Manas takes delivery of A220

Air Manas has just taken delivery of its first Airbus A220-300, and the airline plans to take delivery of up to three of these planes in the coming months. The A220 is an awesome plane, both for airlines and passengers. The economics are phenomenal, and the cabin is in a comfortable 2-3 configuration, with the widest seats in economy that you’ll find on any plane.

I’ve gotta be honest, I’ve heard of a vast majority of airlines around the world, but when I first saw the news from Airbus that an A220 was delivered to Air Manas, I said “huh?”

Air Manas is an airline based in Kyrgyzstan (Manas International Airport is the name of the country’s biggest airport, in Bishkek), and it’s the first airline in the region to operate the Airbus A220. If you ask me, Air Manas’ livery looks mighty similar to SWISS’ livery, and it’s an easy thing to confuse, since SWISS is a big operator of the A220.

What is Air Manas?

As I mentioned above, I didn’t know much about Air Manas, though after doing some digging, I’m fascinated:

Air Manas was founded in 2006, and operated its first flight in 2009

In 2012, 49% of Air Manas was purchased by Turkey’s Pegasus Airlines, given the bilateral trade agreement between Turkey and Kyrgyzstan

The airline rebranded as Pegasus Asia, and then started operating between Bishkek and Istanbul in 2013, along with flights to other destinations

Air Manas operated a fleet of three Boeing 737s, including one 737-400 and two 737-800s

In 2019, Pegasus Airlines sold its shares in Air Manas, at which point the airline suspended operations

Now I also understand why I hadn’t heard of the airline, since it hadn’t been branded as Air Manas in over a decade. Two years have passed since the airline suspended operations, and now the airline will once again fly under its own branding.

I haven’t been able to find much about Air Manas’ plans with the relaunch — where will the airline fly, and how exactly are these A220s configured? If anyone has more details, I’d love to hear them.

It’s also interesting that this airline is relaunching with A220s. While the economics of the A220 are fantastic, you’d think that used planes could be picked up right now for next to nothing. Perhaps this agreement was finalized pre-pandemic.

Kyrgyzstan is near the top of my list of countries to visit, as I enjoyed my trips to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan a while back. And if I do go to Kyrgyzstan, I’d love to fly Air Manas. It’s just a shame that Turkish Airlines no longer operates the Bishkek to Ulaanbaatar route, which was in my opinion the coolest fifth freedom flight in the world.

Bottom line

Air Manas has become the latest airline to take delivery of the Airbus A220, which is a fabulous plane. I’d argue Air Manas is perhaps also the most intriguing airline to take delivery of this plane.

I can’t wait to learn more about what Air Manas has planned for this aircraft and its relaunch, and also to eventually visit Bishkek.

Anyone have more details on Air Manas’ relaunch plans?","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999963045120239}",neutral,0.9999963045120239,0
Airbus and Dassault agree joint FCAS fighter proposal - Yahoo Finance,"Fri, 02 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9haXJidXMtZGFzc2F1bHQtcmVhY2gtdGVudGF0aXZlLXdvcmtzaGFyZS0wOTE4NTE1MjQuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS (Reuters) - Industrial partners led by Airbus and Dassault Aviation have agreed on a joint proposal for the European FCAS fighter, turning a page on a dispute over workshare that had held up negotiations on the flagship defence project.

The agreement, first reported by La Tribune, paves the way for political talks to resume among the project's three government backers, France, Germany and Spain, a source close to the matter told Reuters.

""The governments have received an offer from the companies to build the demonstrator for a new combat plane in the framework of FCAS,"" the French armed forces ministry said, adding that negotiations were continuing on the overall project.

The Future Combat Air System (FCAS) is designed to replace the German-Spanish Eurofighter and Dassault's Rafale with a combination of manned and unmanned aircraft from 2040.

First floated by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron in 2017, the programme has been dogged by political differences as well as corporate disagreements.

It is also up against the rival BAE Systems-led Tempest fighter project involving Britain, Sweden and Italy.

A joint proposal from European defence group Airbus and Dassault still faces outstanding issues including intellectual property matters. Those must be addressed at the political level, Dassault boss Eric Trappier said last month.

Dassault accepts that Airbus will receive a larger overall FCAS workshare but remained ready to pursue a ""Plan B"" if the talks failed, the Dassault chief executive also said.

The industrial partners in the aircraft programme are Airbus on behalf of Germany, France's Dassault and Indra of Spain.

Separate negotiations have been taking place with engine suppliers Safran of France, MTU Aero in Germany and ITP, a Spanish subsidiary of Rolls Royce.

"Airbus, JetBlue bring widebody comfort to single-aisle planes. - Airline Ratings","Fri, 30 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyYXRpbmdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1qZXRibHVlLWJyaW5nLXdpZGVib2R5LWNvbWZvcnQtc2luZ2xlLWFpc2xlLXBsYW5lcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The thought of an extended flight on a single-aisle aircraft is enough to make most people cringe but Airbus and JetBlue are out to prove smaller planes can be just as comfortable as their bigger cousins.

JetBlue this week became the first airline to take delivery of Airbus’ latest Airspace cabin on the first of 13 Airbus A321 LRs destined to fly trans-Atlantic routes.

The Impressive single-aisle cabin is designed to complement the European manufacturer’s A330neo and A350 widebodies.

READ: Queensland rules in half-price ticket sale.

And if the JetBlue specs are anything to go by, it will be a better experience for economy passengers than many widebody planes, including Boeing’s popular 787 Dreamliner.

It will use it on much-anticipated direct flights to London due to start later in 2021.

“These aircraft will allow us to offer our customers attentive, boutique-style service, while also ensuring ample personal space, larger overhead bins, customized lighting and a design that gives the cabin a wide-body feel.,’’ JetBlue chief executive Robin Hayes said.

Features of the new cabin include customizable hero lighting aimed at reducing jet lag, slimmer sidewall panels for extra personal space at shoulder level and improved views through the windows thanks to redesigned bezels and completely integrated window shades.

There is also the latest full LED lighting technologies; the largest overhead bin in class; and new lavatories with hygienic touchless features and antimicrobial surfaces.

JetBlue has taken advantage of A321’s wider cross-section to install 24-fully-flat seats in its Mint premium private suites while the aircraft’s 114 economy passengers get 18.4-inch wide seats with a full 32-inch seat pitch and contoured seta-backs for extra knee space.

The airline also offers four rows of “Even More Space” seating with five additional inches of legroom.

Passengers flying across the Atlantic will be able to take advantage of the airline’s free, high-speed Wi-Fi as well as enjoy a selection of live TV channels and an extensive library of seatback entertainment.

Seats feature easy-to-reach in-seat power from AC and USB-C outlets and customers will be able to customize their inflight meals from the seatback screen.

The A321LR allows airlines to access long-haul markets not previously accessible to single-aisle aircraft and the withdrawal from the trans-Atlantic market of Norwegian Air opens up further opportunities for JetBlue’s competitive offering.

It is looking at routes such as New York -London and Boston-London and reports last month suggested it had secured slots at London’s Heathrow airport for the northern summer season with speculation it could launch in August. The airline also had slots secured at Gatwick.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7251894474029541}",positive,0.7251894474029541,1

The collaboration with the French aerospace giant, which was announced Monday morning, marks the latest in a string of partnership announcements between Luminar and companies like Daimler, Volvo and Mobileye. Until now, these have exclusively focused on applying its light detection and ranging radar to automated vehicles on the ground — not in the skies.

The partnership won’t immediately bring lidar into commercial aircraft. Unlike Luminar’s deal with Daimler, Mobileye and Volvo this is not a production contract, although the aim is that it will lead to one. Instead, the partnership is with Airbus’ UpNext subsidiary, which is focused on developing and eventually applying new technological breakthroughs to aviation. The effort will be folded into Airbus Flightlab, an ecosystem that offers access to flight test platforms across Airbus’ business lines, including commercial aircraft, helicopters, defense and space. Luminar and Airbus will develop and test how lidar can be used to enhance sensing, perception and system-level capabilities to ultimately enable safe, autonomous flight, the companies said.

“We’re able to directly re-apply what we’ve accomplished for the automotive industry into aviation, an established nearly $1 trillion industry,” Luminar founder and CEO Austin Russell said in a statement Monday. “We believe that automation and safety enhancements will transform how we move across all modes of transport as we take our technology from roads to the skies. We look forward to accelerating our shared vision to define the future of flying.”

Lidar, which measures distance using laser light to generate a highly accurate 3D map of the world, is considered by most in the autonomous vehicle industry critical to commercial deployment. Automakers have also begun to view lidar as an important sensor to be used to expand the capabilities and safety of advanced driver assistance systems in new cars, trucks and SUVs available to consumers.

Airbus is interested in how Luminar’s lidar and perception stack can be used to automatically detect obstacles, a key step toward autonomous operation of aircraft such as urban air mobility vehicles. The companies said the sensor also has the potential to “substantially improve the safety of existing aircraft applications.”

Increasing helicopter safety is one of Airbus’ missions. The company said Monday it will introduce a number of new features to its helicopter Flightlab through a project code-named Vertex. These technologies, which include lidar and other sensors coupled with software for obstacle detection, fly-by-wire for enhanced auto-pilot and a touchscreen and head-worn display for inflight monitoring and control, aim to reduce helicopter pilot workload and increase safety. Airbus said that when combined, the system will be able to manage navigation and route preparation, automatic take-off and landing, as well as following a predefined flight path. The incremental integration of these technologies onto the helicopter Flightlab has begun ahead of a complete demonstration in 2023. Airbus said its Urban Air Mobility project will also benefit from this technology as a step toward autonomous flight.

Luminar, which burst onto the autonomous vehicle scene in April 2017 after operating for years in secrecy, became a publicly traded company in late 2020. The company announced in February that it would work with Volvo Cars to develop and eventually sell to other automakers an automated driving system for highways. The partnership, which is between Luminar and Volvo’s self-driving software subsidiary Zenseact, builds upon an existing relationship with Volvo. The two companies are combining their tech to create what Luminar founder and CEO Austin Russell described as a “holistic autonomous vehicle stack” made for production vehicles. Volvo will be the first customer. Russell and Zenseact CEO Ödgärd Andersson said at the time that they plan to also offer this system to other automakers.

Last year, ahead of its public debut, Luminar also locked in a supplier deal to furnish Intel subsidiary Mobileye with lidar for its fleet of autonomous vehicles. Under that contract, Luminar’s lidar will be part of Mobileye’s first-generation fleet of driverless vehicles, which are being piloted in Dubai, Tel Aviv, Paris, China and Daegu City, South Korea.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8959574699401855}",neutral,0.8959574699401855,0
Airbus formally lists highest-weight A350-1000 at 319t - Flightglobal,"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyLXRyYW5zcG9ydC9haXJidXMtZm9ybWFsbHktbGlzdHMtaGlnaGVzdC13ZWlnaHQtYTM1MC0xMDAwLWF0LTMxOXQvMTQzNDcyLmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has formally listed its highest weight variant for the A350-1000, which will have a maximum take-off weight of 319t.

This version of the twinjet, designated as weight variant WV006, is 3t heavier than the previous 316t variants WV002 and WV011.

Fuel capacity of the new variant remains the same as the others, a figure Airbus gives as 156,000 litres – although the European Union Aviation Safety agency puts the -1000’s usable fuel at just under 158,800 litres including nearly 100,000 litres in the centre tank.

The 319t aircraft is listed with a maximum zero-fuel weight of 223t, in revised airport planning documentation, and maximum landing weight of 236t.

No payload-range data has been featured for the variant. Airbus still lists the typical range of the 316t version at around 8,200nm with 366 passengers.

Airbus has previously signalled that a 319t airframe would be the foundation of its offer to Qantas for the Australian carrier’s Project Sunrise programme.

The programme aims to provide non-stop service to cities including Sydney and Melbourne from points such as London and New York – although, as a consequence of the pandemic, the airline has yet to order the intended A350-1000s and has indicated that introduction of Project Sunrise flights is being pushed back at least to 2024.

Qantas selected the A350-1000, equipped with Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines, after considering the General Electric GE9X-powered Boeing 777X.

Airbus has not yet confirmed how the Qantas aircraft will meet the range demand for Project Sunrise, and whether this will include additional fuel capacity, but it has shied away from suggesting it will be an ‘ultra long-range’ modification in the same sense as the A350-900ULR.

Singapore Airlines introduced the A350-900ULR – designated as the -900’s weight variant WV013 – which has higher usable fuel volume, de-activated forward cargo hold, and lower seat-count to achieve the range required.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999951124191284}",neutral,0.9999951124191284,0
Airbus A321XLR Engines: More Power Needed! - Mentour Pilot,"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vbWVudG91cnBpbG90LmNvbS9haXJidXMtYTMyMXhsci1lbmdpbmVzLW1vcmUtcG93ZXItbmVlZGVkL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Spyros Georgilidakis | April 30, 2021

Airbus is reportedly asking engine manufacturers for up-rated versions of their engines, specifically for its upcoming A321XLR.

The information comes from Safran, the French engine company working with General Electric in the CFM International partnership. The manufacturer mentioned this as they announced their Q1 results in 2021. They explained that they have provided Airbus with engines that will suit the A321XLR programme.

Currently, the CFM LEAP-1A and P&W PW1100G produce a bit over 33,000lbs (147kN) of thrust for the A321neo. We don’t know how much extra power Airbus wants from these engines, for the A321XLR. However, this will still be a version of the same engines the rest of the A320neo family has. The makers of these engines already rate them to different power levels for each model.

Airbus A321XLR – Up-rated Engines For More Weight

The need for more power comes from the increase in weight. The engines of the Airbus A321XLR will need to propel 4 metric tons (8.818lbs) more than those on an A321neo. On take-off, the extra long-range variant will tip the scales at 101 tons (222.667lbs). The aircraft will feature stronger landing gear and modifications to its Center Wing Box (CWB) for the same reason.

Airbus’ request for more power for the A321XLR puts in perspective some theories we’ve heard recently. Some feel that the European manufacturer ought to develop a stretched version of the A321 – an A322neo, if you will. Airbus has considered this, but such a project would require a bit of work, beyond the fuselage stretch. The longer jet could require modifications to the wing – something that the A321XLR also needed.

Airbus went with single-slotted inboard flaps for the XLR, instead of the double-slotted ones of the rest of the A320s. They could do this thanks in part to the bigger winglets of newer A320s, which allowed for lower take off and landing speeds. However, we don’t know if these tweaks in its flaps would be enough for an even longer, even heaver aircraft. And of course this Airbus would need more powerful engines, like the A321XLR.

Anyone Else For More Powerful Engines?

Speaking of more powerful engines, there’s also Boeing, and the “will-they-won’t-they” NMA. Among its other roles, this aircraft would compete with the Airbus A321XLR, and it, too, would need powerful engines. However, its engines would almost certainly need to be new, not up-rated LEAP or PW1100Gs. This is because unlike the Airbus A321XLR, which at the upper end of the aircraft family size, the engines of its Boeing NMA adversary will also need to power bigger versions.

What little we know about Boeing’s NMA tells us that it will come in three versions. The smallest is the 7K7-5X, with around 225 seats. The 7K7-6X and 7K7-7X will have 250 and 275 seats respectively. And obviously Boeing needs an engine that will work for all three. Analysts expect it to be in the 50,000lb range. This puts it beyond any engine that Airbus could have for the A321XLR – or the hypothetical A322neo.

Another item of interest that emerged from Safran’s Q1 earnings call has to do with Airbus’ ramp-up. We have seen before that Airbus is keen to increase the rate of production, to limit streamline its operations. The A321XLR is still some way off, but Airbus wants suppliers for engines, in particular, to schedule their production carefully. Both CFM and Pratt & Whitney previously faced delays in their respective A320neo programmes, to greater or lesser extent.

Catching bad guys from the air can be quite different than catching bad guys on the ground — at least in British Columbia.

“We never arrest anyone,” said Cpl. Curtis Brassington. “In my 15 years, we’ve landed, and I’ve arrested one person. And I think I’m the only one who’s done that.”

The H145 (foreground) joins two Airbus H120s (background) in the RCMP’s aviation fleet.

As senior tactical flight officer (TFO) at the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) air services base in the Vancouver region, Brassington explained that he was tracking a person who had stolen a boat and had stopped on an island.

“I said, ‘let’s get him now, since it’s going to take a long time for everyone else to get here.’”

But that’s the exception, given the realities of “quickly” putting a helicopter on the ground. “You’re giving [a suspect] a five-minute lead time as you start circling to find a nice spot to land. It’s not practical,” he added.

Most of his thousands of hours in the air have been spent in the RCMP’s Airbus H120s, operating the sensor suite while coordinating with his pilot and police on the ground.

Now, Brassington and his colleagues have a bigger and newer aircraft to fly the RCMP’s missions, one that is a true utility vehicle.

A new Airbus

It’s been two years since Canada’s first Airbus H145 helicopter showed up in the RCMP’s aviation stable in British Columbia.

The twin-engine light utility machine is based at Langley Regional Airport southeast of downtown Vancouver, sharing the hangar with two Airbus H120s, all providing air support for Canada’s westernmost province.

The H145 is equipped to deploy the RCMP’s Emergency Response Team.

A massive, magnificent territory, B.C. stretches from the Pacific coast to the Rocky Mountains, and from the United States border to the north at the 60th parallel.

With spectacular lakes, mountains, and high prairie, B.C. lives up to its moniker of “Super, Natural British Columbia.” Over half of its five million residents live in the area known as the Lower Mainland, centered on the province’s largest city, Vancouver.

Policing this huge, varied area is the responsibility of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, a federal service. The RCMP is contracted to operate as the provincial police force by the Government of B.C., augmenting the various municipal law enforcement services in urban areas.

Aviation has long been a key component of the RCMP’s operation in B.C. — known as “E” Division — covering the province from six bases, with a mix of a dozen fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters that include the Pilatus PC-12, Quest Kodiak and Airbus AS350 B3.

Having the right machine for the job was a priority for the RCMP when it was looking for a new utility helicopter to replace an AS350 B3 that crashed, with the tragic loss of its pilot, in 2012.

Then-Inspector Nigel Bushe was officer in charge for air services in B.C. when the procurement process for the new aircraft was underway. He retired from the RCMP in November 2020, after 35 years of service.

“We’re the biggest division in the country. A third of the RCMP is in B.C.,” said Bushe, in an interview with Valor. “It was a consultative, collaborative process to get to what we needed, and we talked with [our] units around the province.”

Three bids came back when the proposal for the new helicopter was put out to industry, Bushe said, and “the RCMP’s analysis of the bids concluded that the H145 exceeded our requirements in many of the criteria.”

The flying pickup

“Where the H120 is sort of our sports car, and the AStars at our other bases are our pickup trucks like an F-150, this is our F-350 or F-450,” explained Special Constable Roger Thomson, base manager and pilot, making the comparison to the largest Ford pickups.

“It’s that much bigger,” Thomson added. “The interior is huge, with clamshell doors at the back, and all the seats can come out and be moved around. It’s just a big truck.”

The H145 is a key element of the RCMP’s policing resources in British Columbia.

While the H120s generally work with the police on the ground during regular patrols over the Lower Mainland, the H145 is tasked with a wide variety of missions — servicing mountaintop radio repeaters, transporting emergency response teams, search-and-rescue, as well as law enforcement duties that include patrol of the Canada-United States border.

This flying “big truck” came from Airbus kitted out with the equipment needed to fulfill its multi-mission mandate.

The RCMP’s machine joins the worldwide fleet of 150 H145s operating in airborne law enforcement, of the 1,460 units that have been delivered.

The helicopter that gleams in the RCMP’s spotless hangar traces its roots back to the early 1990s MBB/Kawasaki BK117 C1. This latest version — which officially carries the BK117 D2 type designation — includes technology that would have only been dreamed of 30 years ago.

The machine’s two Safran Helicopter Engines Arriel 2E turbines are equipped with full-authority digital engine control (FADEC), which integrates with the H145’s state-of-the-art Helionix avionics suite.

Designed to give pilots increased situational and operational awareness as well as a reduced workload, Helionix interfaces with the helicopter’s dual-duplex, four-axis autopilot.

Thomson, who has over 10,000 hours in 10 different helicopter types, explained that in normal operations he will lift off manually, and then hand control over to the autopilot.

“It reduces the pilot’s workload,” Thomson said. “Your attention can be elsewhere, rather than just trying to hold an altitude, for example. It’s sophisticated, and with all the computer systems it’s a really simple aircraft to fly. The 145 is the easiest helicopter I’ve ever flown.”

Mission-specific equipment on the H145 includes a TrakkaBeam A800 searchlight, FLIR forward-looking infrared imaging sensor, night vision goggles, radio equipment, and an internal long range fuel tank system.

Airbus quotes a 145-knot cruise speed for the H145, but Thomson said that “Air 5” — the helicopter’s RCMP ID — is draggy with “a lot of stuff hanging off of it,” so it cruises at around 120 knots.

The RCMP’s iconic “Musical Ride” logo is proudly displayed on the H145’s tail fin.

Endurance for the H145 matches the RCMP’s H120s at around 2.5 hours, depending on the mission and fuel load.

Eye in the sky

The high-definition camera system installed in the H145 is “the biggest, longest range camera in the RCMP. We can [see] up to about 10 kilometers [6.2 miles],” said Thomson.

The imagery from the camera system can be fed to one of the multipurpose displays in the front avionics panel, but it’s the crew’s tactical flight officer who normally interprets the visuals on a large monitor in a workstation behind the pilot.

The H145’s Helionix avionics suite give pilots increased situational awareness and reduces workload.

Brassington described the camera system in the H145 in a quintessentially Canadian way.

“If I ask you to watch a hockey game on your old 19-inch RCA and then watch a hockey game on your 55-inch HD flatscreen, which will be better?” Brassington asked. “The H120 has 20-year-old gear and we’d love to get it upgraded, but it still does everything — you can still see the game — but you do get more with the newer system [on the H145]. It’s simply better — better optics, better range, better clarity.”

The H145’s twin engines will bring an increased level of safety on flights over dangerous terrain in B.C.’s rugged interior, looking deep into valleys when on a search mission.

RCMP members receive familiarization training on the H145.

Special Constable Roger Thomson, base manager and pilot, said “the H145is the easiest helicopter I’ve ever flown.”

Special Constable Rob Morrison prepares for a mission in the H145.

Inspector (ret.) Nigel Bushe was Officer in Charge for air service in B.C. when the procurement process for the new aircraft was underway.

Twin Arriel 2E turbines give the H145’s crew an increased level of safety over B.C.’s rugged terrain.

Brassington admits with all the technology that’s available onboard, sometimes the “Mk 1” human eyeball is the best surveillance equipment — as long as the observers are well trained.

“A lot of what we do isn’t with the camera,” he said. “Trying to find something with the camera is like trying to… if I put a grain of salt on a table, and gave you a straw to look through, it’s going to take you forever, whereas if you use your naked eye, you can probably spot it in a minute.”

Teamwork and clear communications between the pilot and TFO are essential on every mission. In the H120, the TFO sits beside the pilot, making it easy to see hand signals, or for either crew member to intuitively pick up on each other’s cues.

“The pilot’s job is to get the TFO to where he needs to be. I position the helicopter so he can see what he needs,” said Thomson.

Video from the high-definition camera system can be displayed on one of the pilot’s multi-function panels.

With the move of the TFO to the workstation in the H145’s cabin, the TFO and the pilot can’t see each other, and have to rely on the intercom to communicate.

“Being in the back of the 145, our communication skills have to be that much better. We’ve been able to hone them for years in the 120, so it’s actually been fairly easy, but very enlightening,” said Brassington.

With the camera imagery on one of the forward multi-function displays, the pilot has the same view as the TFO, but needs context for the target.

“I’d say, ‘Roger, at our 10 o’clock’ and he’d look at the monitor. I’d have the camera nice and wide so he could pick out a landmark he could reference, then I’d zoom in,” explained Brassington.

Video from the high-definition camera system can be displayed on one of the pilot’s multi-function panels.

“Our flying style also has to be different with the 145,” added Thomson. “Now we’re both on the same side in a bigger aircraft, we’re louder, we have to get further away, and we have to get higher so we’re not spotted. His TFO station is directly behind me. We’re looking out the same side, but we have to fly differently. We had to learn how to fly a different orbit — in the 120 we fly counter-clockwise, we’re doing clockwise now because of where we’re sitting.”

Drawing on experience

On missions, pilots must be completely comfortable with maneuvering the machine, a skill that generally comes only with extensive flying experience, and the RCMP looks to the civilian market for high-time candidates.

A pilot must have no fewer than 3,000 hours as pilot-in-command to be considered for an RCMP position, but according to Thomson, the pilots hired in the past 10 years have all had at least 6,000 or 7,000 hours.

The RCMP Emergency Response Team’s Police Dog Services practice hover entry and exits with the H145.

“We need that experience. We don’t need a new guy trying to fight the helicopter and fight crime,” he said.

Brassington agreed. “I’d rather fly with a pilot who has 20 years of flying experience and is learning about policing, than a cop who has 20 years of policing and is learning about flying.”

The Langley team of five pilots, four TFOs, and two maintenance engineers keep the H120s flying about 1,200 hours per year, with the H145 airborne between 300 and 500 hours annually.

The flight time of the twin will naturally increase when the machine reaches full operation, adding the H145’s integrated winch system. The winch can be used for police operations, such as deployment of the RCMP’s Emergency Response and Underwater Recovery Teams, as well as for search-and-rescue.

The approval to begin winch operations has been moving through the required policy processes, and although Thomson had hoped to deploy the H145 with its full capability in 2020, the approval may be delayed into “the spring.”

“Once we get the ability to hoist and long line, then we’ll be 95 percent there. And there are some other things that our emergency response team would like to do, like rappelling or fast roping.”

With the H145’s avionics suite and four-axis autopilot, Thomson can command the machine to automatically hold a hover, simplifying external operations.

He said that once winch approval is granted, “we can be up and running fairly quickly, with two weeks of training and then practice.”

The Airbus H145 is a welcome addition to the RCMP’s Air Services in British Columbia.

The helicopter is instrument flight rules certified, but the approval to operate in instrument conditions is also still in the works. It’s something that Thomson looks at as being the “last five percent” of the helicopter’s operational rollout, but one that is essential to safely deploying the H145 throughout the province.

Bushe summarized the situation: “We’ve encountered several delays, but we’re moving towards utilizing the expertise and experience of our pilots, along with the full capabilities of the helicopter.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999903440475464}",neutral,0.9999903440475464,0
German startup Isar Aerospace signs first launch contract - SpaceNews,"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9nZXJtYW4tc3RhcnR1cC1pc2FyLWFlcm9zcGFjZS1zaWducy1maXJzdC1sYXVuY2gtY29udHJhY3Qv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"VALLETTA, Malta — Isar Aerospace, one of three German startups vying for ESA funding for smallsat launchers they each aim to debut next year, has won its first launch contract.

Airbus Defense and Space plans to launch a future Earth observation satellite on Isar Aerospace’s Spectrum rocket, a two-stage rocket designed to deliver up to 700 kilograms of payload to sun-synchronous orbit. The contract announced April 22 includes options for additional Spectrum launches but does not specify a timeline for the one firm mission.

Isar Aerospace aims to conduct Spectrum’s maiden launch in 2022. Founded in 2018, the Munich-based company recently arranged for exclusive use of one of two launch pads at Norway’s Andøya Space Center, which is currently under construction. The 20-year lease will enable Isar Aerospace to deploy payloads into sun synchronous and polar orbits.

Airbus Defence and Space is currently working on at least two Earth observation constellations destined for sun-synchronous orbits. One of those, Pléiades Neo, will consist of four 750-kilogram satellites, the first of which is slated to launch April 29 on an Arianespace-operated Vega rocket along with five smaller payloads. Airbus plans to use Vega and Avio’s upcoming Vega C to launch the other three Pléiades Neo satellites, which are all too heavy for Spectrum’s advertised 700-kilogram to SSO capacity.

The Composante Optique 3D (CO3D) constellation, a joint undertaking by Airbus and the French space agency CNES, looks like a better fit for Isar Aerospace’s rocket. Although the initial four-satellite CO3D constellation is slated to be launched aboard a Vega C in 2023, Airbus anticipates that the constellation could grow to between 12 and 24 satellites. At 300 kilograms each, these satellites would be well within Spectrum’s projected capabilities to launch two at a time.

A three-way race for ESA funding heats up

Isar Aerospace is one of three German launch startups currently developing small rockets with an eye toward winning European Space Agency support.

Along with Rocket Factory Augsburg and HyImpulse Technologies, the three startups are competing as part of the German Space Agency DLR’s microlauncher competition.

The competition, which is being run in conjunction with ESA, will award one of the three startups with 11 million euros ($13 million) in funding later this year. The funding is to be used to support a qualification flight that will carry a payload for a university or research institution for free. A second prize of 11 million euros in funding will then be awarded in 2022 as the final stage of the competition.

In evaluating the three startups, the DLR panel of judges will examine the technical aspects and commercial feasibility of each launcher. As a result, each startup’s success in securing funding and signing launch contracts will play a role in their chance of winning the competition.

Isar Aerospace is the second of the three German rocket startups to secure their first launch contract. Rocket Factory Augsburg signed a contract with a sister company OHB Sweden AB on March 31 for the launch of a single mission. The as-yet unannounced payload will be launched in mid-2024 aboard the company’s RFA One rocket, which is slated to be launched on its maiden flight in 2022 and is designed to carry payloads of up to 1,300 kilograms into low Earth orbit.

HyImpulse Technologies is developing the three-stage SL1 launch vehicle, which is designed to carry payloads of up to 500 kilograms to low Earth orbit. The vehicle is expected to make its debut in 2022. HyImpulse is the only one of the three startups yet to secure their first launch contract.

In December, Isar Aerospace closed a 75-million-euro Series B funding round. A month earlier, the launch provider was awarded 1.5 million euros as part of the European Space Agency’s Boost! initiative, which aims to foster new commercial space transportation services in Europe. With the addition of its first launch contract, Isar Aerospace is paving the way for the company to be a part of a privately-funded commercial European launch market in its infancy.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999755620956421}",neutral,0.9999755620956421,0
