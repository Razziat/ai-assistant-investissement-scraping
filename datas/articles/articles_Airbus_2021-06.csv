"The green hydrogen ecosystem for aviation, explained - Airbus","Thu, 17 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA2LXRoZS1ncmVlbi1oeWRyb2dlbi1lY29zeXN0ZW0tZm9yLWF2aWF0aW9uLWV4cGxhaW5lZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Investment in green hydrogen is enjoying unprecedented momentum as more and more governments cite this zero-emission energy carrier as an essential component of their net-zero climate strategies. For the aviation industry, green hydrogen is expected to play a key role in fuelling future aircraft. However, a green hydrogen ecosystem will need to take shape to ensure its availability to fuel aviation’s future needs.

Today, the road to net zero for many industries runs through green hydrogen. Indeed, this type of hydrogen – when entirely produced from renewable energy – is emerging as the most suitable for a fully sustainable energy transition for hard-to-abate sectors. As governments worldwide set their sights on more ambitious climate-neutrality targets, green hydrogen – derived from water electrolysis in particular – is expected to play a prominent role in the future energy mix.

But as multiple industries increasingly earmark green hydrogen to help achieve their decarbonisation ambitions, one question remains top of mind: will there be enough green hydrogen for all?

Currently, green hydrogen accounts for less than 1% of the total hydrogen produced. However, this is expected to change. The cost of renewable energies is falling at an unprecedented rate. And investment in electrolysers – the “clean” technology used to separate hydrogen and oxygen atoms in water – is booming worldwide. As a result, green hydrogen production capacity could achieve a 50-fold increase in the next six years, according to some estimates. This means green hydrogen could be on track to supply up to 25% of the world’s energy needs by 2050.

And this rapid and cost-effective scale-up could not be more timely: drastic solutions are now urgently required if the world is to meet the 1.5-degree Celsius target of the Paris Agreement.

Airbus fully expects green hydrogen to power its future zero-emission aircraft when it reaches the market by 2035. The challenge today is to support long-term scale-up to ensure there is enough green hydrogen available to fuel the aviation industry’s needs.

Investing in electrolyser capacity worldwide

Transitioning green hydrogen from a niche player to a competitive and widespread low-carbon energy juggernaut will require significant investment to scale up capacity. And signs point to a positive trend on this point.

The International Energy Agency (IEA)’s Hydrogen Projects Database counts nearly 320 new green hydrogen production demonstration projects worldwide. This amounts to a total of about 200 MW of added electrolyser capacity. And new projects are being added on almost a weekly basis.

In Europe, less than 1 GW/year of electrolyser capacity has been installed with another 1.5-2.3 GW in planned projects. However, the European Commission recently announced longer-term plans to install at least 40 GW of electrolyser capacity or up to 10 million megatons of green hydrogen by 2030. As part of these plans, larger electrolysers – with up to 100 MW capacity as opposed to the current 20 MW capacity – are expected to be built by 2024 and installed next to demand centres. If achieved, this would transform Europe into the world’s largest producer of green hydrogen.

But Europe is not alone in its ambitions: other countries are demonstrating they are not far behind. Australia has one of the world's highest volumes of green hydrogen production capacity, including about 30 GW of projects in the pipeline. In Asia, the region’s electrolyser capacity could reach +10 GW over the coming decade, driven by demand from Japan, South Korea and China. Across the pond, the USA is also starting to catch up with plans to develop green hydrogen mega-projects in California, Texas and Utah.

The leap from megawatt- to gigawatt-scale projects is not only a harbinger of the expected enormous future demand for green hydrogen but also the anticipated decline of costs through economies of scale. According to a report released by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), green hydrogen production costs have already begun to fall largely due to a decline in renewable energy costs and further cost savings in electrolysis facilities. For green hydrogen to be cost-competitive, these costs will need to continue to fall from 40% in the short term to 80% in the long term.

Getting green hydrogen to airports: how will it work?

Green hydrogen is an energy pathway that forms a critical part of Airbus’ strategy to lead the decarbonisation of the aviation industry. This means architecting the future green hydrogen ecosystem for aviation will need to start now in preparation of an entry-into-service of hydrogen aircraft by 2035 – and it could look something like this.

Power generation : Renewable energy – via hydropower, geothermal power, solar panels or wind turbines – is generated at the source. This energy is then transformed into renewable electricity to power electrolysers, the key extraction technology for green hydrogen.

This energy is then transformed into renewable electricity to power electrolysers, the key extraction technology for green hydrogen. Production : Electrolysers are used to separate hydrogen atoms from oxygen atoms in water – a process known as electrolysis – to generate hydrogen. Power-to-Liquid (PtL) synthetic e-fuel – which combines hydrogen with carbon obtained via Direct Air Carbon Capture – is produced at dedicated facilities. When demand reaches a tipping point, airports are expected to develop on-site facilities to produce hydrogen within close proximity to operations, while off-site facilities remain a good option when meeting demand from other hydrogen consumers.

Hydrogen produced off site is transported to liquefaction sites via pipelines, notably repurposed natural gas pipelines. Upon liquefaction, it is stored and then transported directly to airports by truck. Optionally, cargo ships can transport larger quantities of hydrogen from overseas locations. PtL uses jet fuel’s existing supply infrastructure to reach airports.

End use: Hydrogen is used to fuel short-haul aircraft (via combustion or fuel cells), while PtL – blended with jet fuel – remains an option to fuel longer-haul aircraft.

If progress on the hydrogen economy’s ramp-up continues as expected, green hydrogen will not only be readily available but also cost-effective by 2030 – a timeline that aligns with Airbus’ ambitions. Indeed, Airbus fully expects green hydrogen to power its future zero-emission aircraft when it reaches the market by 2035. The green hydrogen ecosystem for aviation is already taking shape as more and more key players sign on to make it a reality. The challenge today is to support long-term scale-up to ensure there is enough green hydrogen available to fuel the aviation industry’s needs."
Another Boeing-Airbus tanker war is coming soon - Defense News,"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXIvMjAyMS8wNi8xNi9hbm90aGVyLWJvZWluZy1haXJidXMtdGFua2VyLXdhci1pcy1jb21pbmctc29vbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — Boeing and Airbus could find themselves duking it out as early as next year to provide aerial refueling aircraft to the U.S. Air Force, reigniting a bitter battle between Boeing’s KC-46 and Airbus’s A330 Multi Role Tanker Transport.

The Air Force on Tuesday released a sources sought notice for a non developmental tanker aircraft known as KC-Y that would bridge the gap between KC-46 and the next-generation KC-Z tanker.

The Air Force is looking for companies that could deliver as many as 15 commercial derivative tankers a year, with the new bridge tanker operational in 2029 — the same year the last KC-46 is due to be delivered.

The service plans to buy 140 to 160 KC-Ys to continue the replacement of its aging KC-135 fleet, which will be 70 years old when the bridge tanker is fielded, the solicitation stated. The competition could start as early as 2022, when the service issues a final request for proposals.

The Air Force provided few details on how KC-Y would differ from KC-46, only saying that it is still finalizing its requirements.

“However, the baseline for aircraft capability will be based on the requirements from phase one of tanker recapitalization, with subsequent and emerging requirements as defined by the Air Force,” the service stated in its solicitation.

With the Air Force emphasizing that vendors should provide non-developmental aircraft that can be fielded in less than a decade, a contest between Boeing and Airbus is all but ensured.

Mike Hafer, who leads Boeing’s global sales and marketing of the KC-46, said that the company looks forward to proposing the KC-46 for the KC-Y program.

“We’ve learned a lot and we’re going to focus on the Air Force’s needs, fulfilling the requirements of the contract, and providing exactly what the Air Force wants,” he told Defense News in an exclusive interview. “We’re ready to compete.”

Airbus, which teamed with Lockheed Martin in 2018 to offer the A330 MRTT in the United States, also plans to compete in the program, Lockheed spokeswoman Stephanie Stinn said.

“We are responding to the U.S. Air Force’s Sources Sought Notification for the Bridge Tanker Program, offering a mission-ready solution to meet the Air Force’s future tanker requirements,” she said.

The KC-X competition ultimately resulted in the award of a $4.9 billion contract to Boeing in 2011, but it was preceded by years of contention.

The Air Force had awarded Airbus — which was then called EADS and partnered with Northrop Grumman — a contract for the program in 2008, but Boeing’s legal protest was successful and overturned the award. Northrop then pulled out of the competition in 2010, and Airbus’s solo bid with the A330 was ultimately successful.

Since winning the KC-46 program, Boeing has incurred more than $5 billion in losses as technical glitches have stacked up and required expensive fixes. (The terms of Boeing’s fixed-price contract with the Air Force requires it to pay for any costs in excess of the initial $4.9 billion award.)

However, Hafer was confident that Boeing’s struggles on the KC-46 wouldn’t influence its chances of winning KC-Y.

“That’s a lot of risk that’s been retired. These are identified issues that we’ve put to bed and we’re closing very rapidly with the other ones out there,” he said. “This was an investment that the U.S. Air Force has paid [and] is getting the capability they want and need.”

However, some lawmakers have shown interest in canceling Boeing’s KC-46 contract and moving that business to Airbus.

During a House Armed Services Committee hearing Wednesday, Reps. Rob Wittman, R-Va., and Mike Rogers, R-Ala., expressed frustration with the KC-46 and asked Air Force leaders to consider re-competing the contract due to Boeing’s poor performance.

Republican Rep. Jerry Carl — who represents Mobile, Ala., where Airbus currently makes commercial planes — made the case that U.S. Air Force fighters operating in Europe regularly receive fuel from the A330 tanker.

“Knowing that we’ve got an aircraft that can be built in America, that could be already delivered because we’re up to about three a month coming out of Mobile right now — not this particular plane, but basically the same scale — why are we not bringing this back up for a bid?” he asked.

Acting Air Force Secretary John Roth said but the service currently doesn’t see a cost-benefit to re-opening the KC-X competition.

“I take your point in terms of the history of the contact,” he said. “But…we’re concerned that if we tried to go into a new contract vehicle, that would put additional delays into the program that we simply don’t think would be efficacious for us.”

The Air Force intends to buy 179 KC-46s over the program of record, wrapping up procurement in fiscal year 2027. On Wednesday, Boeing announced the delivery of the 46th KC-46, which flew to Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, N.C., that afternoon.

Airbus-Boeing deal eases US-EU tensions but conflicts remain - The Associated Press,"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2dvdmVybm1lbnQtYW5kLXBvbGl0aWNzLWpvZS1iaWRlbi1ldXJvcGUtZ2xvYmFsLXRyYWRlLWJ1c2luZXNzLWU4YTRjZmZiMjdiY2FkNjkyNDBjMjgzYTg5YTE3ZmE40gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"BRUSSELS (AP) — The deal the United States and the European Union reached Tuesday to end their long-running rift over subsidies to Boeing and Airbus will suspend billions in punitive tariffs. It will ease trans-Atlantic tensions. And it will let the two sides focus on a common economic threat: China.

But the breakthrough still leaves some trade friction between the U.S. and the EU unresolved. Most prominently, President Biden kept in place import taxes that President Donald Trump imposed on European steel and aluminum, a move that infuriated some of America’s closet allies three years ago.

For now, Tuesday’s truce in the Boeing-Airbus dispute goes a long way toward repairing a huge commercial relationship — $933 billion in two-way trade last year despite the pandemic — that came under enormous strain during the Trump years. Among other things, the former president angrily charged the Europeans with using unfair trade practices to sell more products to the United States than they bought and of shirking their responsibility to pay for their own national defense.

No trade dispute between the two sides has raged longer than their aviation conflict. Since 2004, the U.S. and the EU have accused each other of unfairly subsidizing their aircraft-building giants — America’s Boeing and Europe’s Airbus. Over the past two years, the World Trade Organization, which adjudicates such disputes, declared both sides guilty. It allowed the United States to impose up to $7.5 billion in tariffs and the EU up to $4 billion’ worth.

The tit-for-tat duties victimized companies that have nothing to do with aircraft production, from French winemakers and German cookie bakers in Europe to spirits producers in the United States, among many others. Tuesday’s agreement brought a measure of relief to companies on both sides of the Atlantic.

“For about 20 years, we have been at each other’s throat,’’ U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said. “We have been too busy fighting each other.’’

In March, weeks after Biden took office, the two sides agreed to suspend the tariffs. That suspension, which began March 11, was to last for four months. The agreement announced Tuesday will officially take effect July 11 and will put the tariffs on hold for five years.

“It’s obviously a good sign — they agreed to something,” said William Reinsch, a former U.S. trade official who is now an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

The truce, he said, will add “an element of certainty and sanity’’ to trans-Atlantic trade.

But Reinsch notes that the two sides “kind of kicked the can down the road,’’ by leaving unsettled some issues in the aircraft dispute, such as whether Airbus must repay the government subsidies it received over the years. Instead, the U.S. said in a fact sheet, the two sides had agreed to establish a group “to analyze and overcome any disagreements that may arise.’’

The deal might help solidify the duopoly of Airbus and Boeing, which together dominate the global market for airline jets. Both companies have struggled recently with declining orders and deliveries at a time when the pandemic devastated air travel and led airlines to cancel or delay purchases.

Tuesday’s agreement made clear that the United States and the EU recognize that Boeing and Airbus face an external threat far bigger than each other: As part of its aggressive drive to become the world’s dominant industrial power, China is intent on developing its own plane-making industry with heavy government support.

“It will be a classic Chinese game plan,” Reinsch said. The government in Beijing will “force all the Chinese airlines to buy theirs. They’ll create a market. Their planes will get better, and once they’ve gotten better and cheaper, they’ll start flooding the global market.”

The U.S. and EU have agreed to work together to counter Beijing’s efforts to obtain foreign aviation technology. They plan to take joint action against unfair trade practices that appear intended to give Chinese plane manufacturers unfair advantages.

Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with Teal Group, suggested that the agreement will help the U.S. and Europe pivot to present a united front against China. He noted that Chinese airlines delayed deliveries from Boeing and Airbus during the pandemic but continued to take deliveries from China’s own aircraft manufacturer, COMAC.

“The Chinese want to close their market and go their own way, and the biggest export market on the planet for Airbus and Boeing just goes away,” Aboulafia said.

The U.S.-EU agreement won’t stop China from doing that, he predicted, “but at least they can prevent a scenario where China divides the West and plays the U.S. and its allies off against each other.”

In another sign of a trans-Atlantic reconciliation, the Group of Seven wealthy countries, including France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom, agreed this month to a Biden administration proposal for a 15% global minimum tax on the earnings of multinational corporations.

The idea is still a long way from taking effect. But a global corporate tax could potentially resolve another dispute between Washington and Europe: Several European countries, frustrated that big tech companies are so deft at avoiding taxes, have imposed digital services taxes aimed at American companies such as Google and Apple.

Calling the taxes unfair, the U.S. has prepared tariffs in retaliation. But a global tax rate that hits a broader range of multinationals could defuse the issue by raising tax revenue without discriminating against U.S. companies.

Washington and its European trading partners remain sharply at odds over Trump’s 2018 steel and aluminum tariffs. What the Europeans found especially galling was the justification for the import taxes: Trump declared the foreign metals a threat to U.S. national security, even though many of the countries hit hardest by the levies were America’s NATO allies.

What’s more, the tariffs did not directly address the biggest problem that steel and aluminum manufacturers face: Vast overproduction from China keeps global metals prices lower than they would otherwise be.

Despite pledging to mend relations with Europe, Biden has so far kept the Trump tariffs in place. They are popular with American trade unions and metals manufacturers in the U.S. Midwest, a region politically crucial to Biden and his Democratic Party.

Still, in a goodwill gesture last month, the EU agreed to suspend plans to escalate tariffs against U.S. products in the metals dispute. And in a joint statement, the two sides said they would address overproduction of steel and aluminum and “hold countries like China that support trade-distorting policies to account.”

“The answer is a global arrangement in which everybody else forces the Chinese to eat their surplus’’ steel and aluminum, Reinsch said.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed cautious optimism that a deal on the metals tariffs could be reached by year’s end.

Airbus Set To Transform Industrial Setup And Processes By 2025 - Aviation Week,"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9hZXJvc3BhY2UvYWlyYnVzLXNldC10cmFuc2Zvcm0taW5kdXN0cmlhbC1zZXR1cC1wcm9jZXNzZXMtMjAyNdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When Michael Schoellhorn joined Airbus as part of the new team put together by incoming CEO Guillaume Faury in 2019, the company seemed to be in a really good place. Since Boeing’s MAX program was already struggling, Airbus had a leading share of the narrowbody market and was catching up on widebody deliveries, despite the ill-fated A380 program. A corruption scandal was clearly associated with a former management team. The only major issue seemed to be how fast Airbus would be able to deliver aircraft, with demand outpacing single-aisle production. In many ways, it was an embarrassment of riches.

Airbus transforms production, processes and industrial setup

Future production system to be in place within four years

Launch decisions loom for derivatives and new designs

But the more Faury, Chief Operating Officer Schoellhorn and the other new members of the executive team dug into their jobs and analyzed the situation, the more they concluded that something fundamental needed to be done about Airbus’ legacy production process—within reasonable limits—and to revamp a convoluted production system established decades ago. “It was clear that we could not continue like this,” Schoellhorn recalls.

Two years later, Airbus is in the midst of a deep transformation. It is not the first time in its history for such adjustments: It has changed its industrial setup, refined the organizational structure, rethought its production logic, introduced new technologies and tools, prepared a new revolutionary product and, wherever it makes sense, expanded digitalization. Now, however, everything is happening at roughly the same time.

Airbus is gearing up for a very different future and has given itself a clear time frame: By 2025, the group wants to have in place the organizational and technological basis for the launch of the next generation of aircraft—to be powered by liquid hydrogen—and plans for it to enter commercial service 10 years later. Its “future production system”—to be applied to legacy aircraft lines as well—is scheduled to be ready by then. Additionally, 2025 is the target year for narrowbody output to increase to an unprecedented level of almost 90 aircraft per month, a figure that has left many in the industry—and inside Airbus—puzzled.

The opening challenge for Faury’s team was the single-aisle production meltdown. As Airbus ramped up to record highs, deliveries were consistently late. Sometimes the handover was delayed only a few weeks; more often than not, it was many months. Rather than shifting delivery dates once and sticking to the new timetable, Airbus routinely postponed delivery dates several times.

Customers urgently looking for lift were furious: “Not a single aircraft from Airbus is delivering on time,” Air Lease Corp. CEO John Plueger said in 2017. Why did this happen? The volume was more than the system could handle. Suppliers, including engine manufacturers, could not keep to the agreed-upon schedules. While some parts were missing, others were stockpiled, weighing heavily on Airbus’ financials in what should have been highly profitable—but turned out to be wasteful—times.

Schoellhorn, who had run company operations in other industries, turned to good old management theory and introduced value stream mapping (VSM), a tenet of lean management. “We quickly introduced an end-to-end view of production, away from the very pronounced functional structure,” he says. “With [increasing] production rates, there is a certain inflection point when it is more important to look at the flow and the value chain, rather than the individual steps along the way.”

By early 2020, things looked much better. Airbus, for the first time in years, began hitting its targets and delivering on time despite record volumes. There were fewer customer complaints.

Then, in March, the COVID-19 pandemic began spreading in earnest. Aviation fell off a cliff, and with it, all of Airbus’ plans. Almost every customer asked to at least delay deliveries, in many cases by years. Demand for aircraft dwindled daily. “There is negative net demand,” Avolon CEO Domhnal Slattery said at the time.

Those deliveries that still took place simply could no longer be avoided by airlines without severe penalties. As it turned out, VSM helped even as the situation turned south. “We could ramp down, very quickly, the whole production chain and get back in sync,” Schoellhorn says. “That was only possible because of what we had introduced before. We had the necessary transparency.”

Boeing had also looked at production technology through its Black Diamond project, focusing on flow and possible lessons from the automotive sector. Although Schoellhorn concedes that the U.S. competitor had a head start tackling legacy industrial processes, he now feels Airbus has largely caught up.

Dealing with legacy issues is one thing. “What Airbus is doing internally is much more about the second half of this decade or even the first half of the next,” says consultancy Agency Partners analyst Sash Tusa. The OEM is preparing the groundwork for future aircraft. First, the launch of a freighter version of the A350 is approaching, possibly by year-end. Next up is what will likely be the last iteration of the A321neo, known colloquially as the A322: a stretched, rewinged, reengined version of the A321neo that, Tusa says, Airbus could launch as soon as 2023, the year the A321XLR is to be introduced. And, of course, the company much launch the next-generation aircraft around 2026 to have it ready by 2035.

In the near term, the trajectory is different for widebodies and narrowbodies. Although widebody production has collapsed and will stay at much-reduced levels for the foreseeable future, Airbus is already planning to exceed precrisis volumes for its single-aisles in 2023. Whatever has been changed in widebody production layouts will, therefore, remain in place for much longer.

The A380 was the easiest to tackle; production ceased this year. In its place, a new narrowbody final assembly line (FAL) will be built by the end of 2022. The A330, too, is “at the edge of what you can still describe as serial production,” Schoellhoern says. The line is running at two aircraft per month, supported by Multi-Role Tanker Transport deliveries in the defense segment. There are no plans to terminate the program despite the losses it is taking. The A330neo is needed to keep Boeing disciplined on 787 pricing, and at some point, some level of replacement demand from the large installed base of A330ceos should emerge. Not all the operators will move to Boeing, the A350 or the A321XLR.

The most interesting piece of that segment is the A350 line. Produced at rate 10 in 2019 and ready to go to 13, it is now at rate 5. Part of the adjustment was relatively straightforward: Some stations were duplicated for the higher volumes. With one of the two shut down for some time, the maximum rate automatically declined to 6.5. But that meant that at some other points that exist only once, such as Station 40 (wing join-up), there was massive overcapacity. The solution is to take out work packages from that particular step and move it to others that are underutilized at that moment.

Complicating matters is that whatever change is made needs to be reversible. “We don’t want to be limited to rate 5 or 6 in the long run,” Schoellhorn says. “We see that widebodies will come back beyond 2025. Whether we will see the old rates again, nobody knows at the moment.”

In the narrowbody sector, not only does Airbus expect the old rates to return but it also plans to exceed them. The A320neo line was at 60-plus aircraft per month just before the pandemic and is now at 40. Airbus has already confirmed that it will go to 43 in the third quarter and 45 in the fourth. In addition, the OEM has asked its suppliers for rate 64 in the early part of 2023—equivalent to a 62% increase in production within two years. That in itself is a vast challenge for both the OEM and a supply chain that has struggled with less steep curves in the past. But that is not the end of the line: Another two or so years later, Airbus is looking at rate 75, almost 20% more than its past peak.

The other narrowbody program in the portfolio, the A220, will undergo a tripling in output to 14 aircraft per month from 4-5.

Financially, the rationale is clear. The A320neo is currently the only profitable Airbus program, so the company has an incentive to make the most of it while Boeing is trying to recover the much weaker 737 MAX program. Airbus also needs production at volume to transform the consistently loss-making A220 into an economic success. Whether demand is high enough to justify the plan is another story. Only time will tell.

Industrially, the task is huge and involves changes where possible. Airbus’ system of narrowbody final assembly lines includes two outdated ones in Toulouse and Hamburg’s lines 1-3, which are more modern and have been replicated in Tianjin, China, and Mobile, Alabama. Hamburg’s more automated line 4 was, according to Schoellhoern, “a huge step forward technologically,” but it was also a major headache to set up. The A220 is assembled in Mirabel, Quebec, and Mobile.

In theory, digital design, manufacturing and services (DDMS) is the target—meaning gapless digital tools and databases are in place for the full life cycle of an aircraft. The reality is quite different, and will be for a long time. “I’m a big believer in digitalization,” one executive says. “I like additive manufacturing and robotics, too. But it pretty much always failed where it has been put in place in aerospace.” Why? “Because it is very hard to apply to an existing design that is 30 years old and was designed for paper drawings.” The good news: “Where it has worked, it has worked really well,” the executive says.

Airbus knows both sides of the coin, it seems. The legacy parts of the aircraft, a 1980s design in the case of the A320, are not retroactively digitalized. But everything that is new presents an opportunity.

The first big item is the rear center tank (RCT) of the A321XLR, an additional tank intended to provide more fuel volume for greater range that is integrated with the aircraft’s structure. There was also no discussion about outsourcing the RCT. “It is so complex and innovative to a degree that we decided we wanted to master [the RCT] ourselves,” Schoellhorn says. The parts of the A321XLR wing that are modified will also be created using DDMS. In Airbus Defense and Space, the Eurodrone will be completely done in DDMS. Airbus Helicopters is introducing the concept, too.

The real question, however, is “whether the supply chain is ready for DDMS,” the executive says. “My observation is that with the precarious state some of the suppliers are in right now, they have not even started thinking about it.” The importance of supply chain participation in the concept is shown by the success of the A350 development, which was relatively smooth. “The digital A350 design was hugely successful because the suppliers came onto the platform, too,” the executive says.

An untenable imbalance exists in the Airbus industrial system. Toulouse is heavily reliant on widebody lines that will not return in any major way for many years, and its two narrowbody FALs are outdated. The OEM is introducing a new line that represents its most up-to-date thinking about the degree of automation and that can be planned in an ideal spacial layout. “The new FAL will be based on lessons learned from all previous concepts,” Schoellhorn says. It is not supposed to provide additional capacity per se and will officially replace one of the two older lines, which will remain in place as a buffer during the spool-up of the new facility.

As in Hamburg, the new narrowbody line will be housed in a large hangar originally built for the A380 and no longer needed for the terminated program. But unlike in Hamburg, Toulouse has no space constraints and therefore offers the proper environment for a good flow of materials.

Schoellhorn has yet to reveal all the details, but the approaches to automation and setup will be different. Fuselages will be moved around less often. There will be fewer six-axle roboters, automation will be more mobile and Airbus will take advantage of technology developed by MTM Robotics, a company it acquired in 2019. Automation is to be advanced not only in final assembly but also in the logistics of bringing parts and components to their destinations.

Some of the lessons were hard-learned. Hamburg 4 was a big step forward in production technology, but Airbus had to know its limits, too. The facility was not ideal, and more importantly what applies to DDMS is also true for automation. Some parts of aircraft design are simply not a good fit for a high degree of automation due to tolerances and reachability. “Deficiencies in the original design make a high degree [of automation] very difficult,” Schoellhorn says.

Going forward, it is a different story. “We are looking at the next design and [will] think about what would be ideal,” he explains. “Then we [will] use every additional variant of the A320neo or the A350, when we develop it further in additional steps, to design the delta in DDMS. . . . . Digital design quickly leads you to digital production.” And the approach is not limited to final assembly: Aerostructures subsidiaries Stelia Aerospace in France and Premium Aerotec in Germany have their own automation projects in the works.

All iterations of current programs are to be used as further steps toward full implementation of the new industrial system, ahead of the planned move to hydrogen aircraft.

In the widebody sector, a freighter version of the A350 is the next opportunity. The COVID-19 pandemic made it clear, even to those who ignored the issue in good times, that Airbus has a gaping hole in its portfolio: freighters. Boeing was able to sell the cargo version of the 747-8 until recently; the 767 continues as a freighter 39 years after its entry into service; and, of course, the 777F is a major success story, providing Boeing strong margins. Boeing is even preparing the formal launch of a 777X freighter, possibly with Qatar Airways as the first customer.

By contrast, Airbus has a backlog of zero for the A330-200F. There is no cargo variant of the A350, though CEO Faury is adamant that should change. It is too late to take advantage of the current freighter boom, but leaving Boeing with a monopoly in the long-haul freighter market much longer is unacceptable for Airbus.

For narrowbodies, some opportunities are on the horizon ahead of the transition to the next generation of aircraft.

First, more versions of the A320neo family are either already decided or likely to be added. The A321XLR, the long-range version of the A321neo capable of flying 4,700 nm, will be introduced in 2023. The aircraft’s first components are already being produced. Fuselage sections, including the RCT, will be assembled on a separate line when they arrive at the Hamburg FAL to avoid slowing down the main FAL in the early part of the learning curve, at a time when Airbus plans to exceed precrisis production volumes. Disruption caused by a more complex new version, spreading across the other variants, is the last thing the company needs.

More substantial upgrades might come further down the road, including the A322 to counter whatever Boeing comes up with in the by-now famous middle-of-the-market segment. Changes to the design might also introduce a composite wing, prototypes of which Airbus has been working on for years anyway, and new, more efficient engines capable of running on 100% sustainable aviation fuels.

The project could be the last major new iteration of the A320neo family before Airbus brings hydrogen-powered aircraft to market. And it is more likely to happen than not: “Airbus essentially already has the wing ready, [and] it can take the next-generation geared-turbofan engines—all it needs is a product,” says an industry source.

The A220 is the other special case. As a Bombardier product originally, it is completely different from all other Airbus models. That is true not only for product design but also for its industrial setup. Whereas Airbus has historically not outsourced components it considered core to the business, Bombardier gave away more or less the entire aircraft to suppliers, largely keeping only core development, design, marketing and sales plus final assembly in-house.

That approach, including unfavorable supplier contracts, has been one of the key issues causing the program’s high cost of production—and continues to be a problem for Airbus as its new owner. Taking more work in-house could be a logical step, also aligning the A220 more with the general production philosophy. But Schoellhorn says that is not the plan. “At the moment, the focus is on profitability, not changing the degree of vertical production depth,” he says. There are several reasons for that approach: First, management can handle only so much at any given time. Second, he says, “We don’t know yet what design changes will come. When they do, we could then change the production footprint.”

Although Schoellhorn does not specify the potential changes, it is no secret that Airbus has the designs ready for a further stretch of the fuselage to offer the A220-500, an aircraft that could contain more than 150 seats in a legacy airline layout and compete directly with the 737-8 (and the A320neo). Its introduction could be years away, in part because of the profitability issues as well as the threat of cannibalizing the only profitable Airbus program. It is still an important piece in the strategy toolbox, and many believe the launch is a question of when, not if.

It is also a good way to remind suppliers of the need for discipline, even though changes to the aircraft’s industrial system may be less than some expect.

The supply chain is the last big piece of Airbus’ industrial relaunch. In a sense, Airbus has just made the decision to bring a large chunk of the supply chain back in-house, but Schoellhorn says that beyond a specific case more vertical integration is not the plan.

That case involves aerostructures subsidiaries Premium Aerotec (referred to as PAG inside Airbus) and Stelia Aerospace. The two were initially carved out of Airbus in 2008-09, at a time when management wanted to prepare the two for an eventual sale—much like how Boeing spun off Spirit AeroSystems years earlier. After years of unsuccessful sell-off efforts and a review of the situation early this year, Faury decided that what PAG and Stelia do should remain part of the core, killing the sales plans. Instead, both will become part of new larger units, based in Germany and France, that will also include sites that are currently part of Airbus itself.

Trying to sell PAG and Stelia was, in the first place, “an utterly failed industrial project,” says Agency Partners’ Tusa. He concedes that Airbus at the time felt compelled to do it, not only because of Boeing’s Spirit move but also because of the major outsourcing on the 787 program (which was later partially rolled back).

“[Premium Aerotec and Stelia] have many strengths,” Schoellhorn says. “By having been autonomous they became more entrepreneurial. They specialized in aerostructures and built company structures and leadership routines accordingly. But the supplier-customer relationship was difficult. It was too transactional. Everything had to go through contract negotiations, pricing and transfer pricing talks. It was simply too complex.”

Now Airbus is trying to achieve the best of both worlds: the benefits of entrepreneurial autonomy and VSM inclusion.

With hydrogen comes a changed aircraft architecture. Fuselages will need to be wider and longer, and this will be a core aspect of mastering the new generation of aircraft. “The nature of the next generation of aircraft is that it is entirely integrated,” Tusa notes. “There are no more clearly divisible bits. The shapes are more complex, the interfaces more important, even if we don’t go for flying wings. The fuselage gains similar importance for aircraft performance to wings and control surfaces.” Therefore, regardless of PAG and Stelia’s legacy performance, the closer insourcing makes sense to him conceptually.

But what Airbus management has in mind will also apply to existing programs. It wants to differentiate more strictly between build-to-order and build-to-stock manufacturing. Build-to-order is essentially the customization of a particular aircraft for a specific airline, including final assembly. The build-to-stock concept will be applied to the standardized components that go into every aircraft.

PAG and Stelia will focus on the standardized build-to-stock system, while Airbus itself will take the parts from there and turn them into the final product. As a consequence and as one example, large portions of the Hamburg-Finkenwerder narrowbody plant will become part of the new German aerostructures company, and several sites in France will move into the new French affiliate.

Full reintegration into Airbus is not an option, though unions in France and Germany would prefer nothing less. First, Airbus wants to be able to compare its costs of producing aerostructures with those at Spirit or GKN Aerospace. “In-house production has priority, but it can’t be decoupled completely from market reality in terms of costs,” Schoellhorn says.

So far, Airbus has been unable to compare its costs in aerostructures assembly with those of its suppliers. With a merger back into the corporate structure, the split between the OEM and Tier 1 supplier business would have been lost, as would the entrepreneurial spirit Airbus hopes to retain at its in-house partners. Schoellhorn also contends that the cost of OEM complexity would weigh heavily on fully integrated supplier work, even if it was done elsewhere.

The detailed parts business still may be spun off from PAG. “Just to keep the jobs, we stuck to work packages for too long that you cannot defend in [high-cost] Germany,” Schoellhorn says. “Everyone else has placed the work in best-cost countries or with suppliers.”

It is not yet a given that the small-parts business, which employs about 3,000 people, will be sold. Unions have stepped up against doing that and management has promised that with the right structures in place, it will consider keeping it. But Airbus’ preference is for a strategic investor already present in the business, one with expertise and scale.

All the changes—digitalization, organizational resetting and automation are “fuel-agnostic,” Tusa says. In other words, they make sense for any of Airbus’ future aircraft concepts. The reason, Tusa says, is: “Fifteen years from now, the aircraft that roll out the factory doors will look very different.” He says that committing to introducing a hydrogen-powered aircraft by 2035 is “a gamble” because it is not yet clear whether it can work. However, he says, the good news is, “Airbus is setting itself the highest bar.” If it turns out that only more modest, incremental change is possible in the time frame, “they can only win,” he says.

The biggest risk might be not in the transformation but in the lack of follow-through. Some think that risk is real. The project has been largely driven by Schoellhorn, who is moving on to become CEO of Airbus Defense and Space in July. The management reshuffle was initiated because the current CEO of that division, Dirk Hoke, has wanted to leave for some time and needed to be replaced. According to the still well-established, if informal, power-sharing between French and Germans inside Airbus, Defense and Space is to be run by a German.

Schoellhorn’s successor as chief operating officer, Alberto Gutierrez, might help Airbus politically as it consolidates its presence in Spain but he has yet to prove that he pursues the transformation with the same commitment as his predecessor. That makes it all the more important for Faury to stay closely involved and for Schoellhorn to step up in the group executive committee. Sabine Klauke, who is taking on a new merged role of head of engineering and chief technology officer, will also be a central figure in implementing Airbus’ plans.

The other big risk is mostly beyond Airbus’ control. Can suppliers, in addition to mastering DDMS, handle VSM processes? Can all the crucial partners recover from the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic? And can they handle the unprecedented ramp-up that Airbus has mapped out for them? Schoellhorn says Airbus will make much deeper, forensic checks into the way the suppliers operate and plan processes and train people to be prepared. A close relationship will be more important than ever."

Los Angeles — The pandemic’s winter of self-preservation has given way to a summer season for fighting again between Boeing and Airbus, defined by the results of their long-term product strategies decisions, geopolitical turmoil and an acute industry hangover. The years that will immediately follow 2020’s industry collapse will be marked by a growing imbalance between once equally-matched plane makers, a measurable shift in the industry’s tectonic plates.

Single-aisle jets dominate Airbus and Boeing’s focus. In formalizing its post-pandemic production plans, by year end, Airbus plans to build 50 single-aisle aircraft every month and is plotting a steep ramp up by mid-decade — nearly 90% higher than today. The picture looks different at Boeing, where 737 Max production will rebound to 31 each month by early next year following the jet’s protracted grounding, capped by outstanding re-certification of the 737 Max inside China.

“There is…very much a move that Airbus believes it is capturing a dominant share” with demand for variants of the A321neo, said John Plueger, Chief Executive of Air Lease Corporation in a one-on-one interview in Los Angeles with The Air Current last week. “So this is the time. This is the time to go for it. And that’s actually a very natural market decision to take.”"

The United States and European Union said Tuesday they have resolved a 17-year-long fight over aircraft subsidies, agreeing to suspend tariffs for five years stemming from the Boeing -Airbus dispute.

""This meeting has started with a breakthrough on aircraft,"" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who met with President Joe Biden at a U.S.-EU summit in Brussels.

U.S. trade representative Katherine Tai said during a videocall Tuesday that: ""Today's announcement resolves a longstanding trade irritant in the U.S.-Europe relationship.""

""Instead of fighting with one of our closest allies, we are finally coming together against a common threat,"" she added, mentioning China.

She added in a joint statement with the EU that both sides ""now have time and space to find a lasting solution through our new Working Group on Aircraft, while saving billions of euros in duties for importers on both sides of the Atlantic.""

CNBC reported last week that the EU was pressing the White House to reach a deal to end trade tariffs imposed during the Trump administration, in relation to the Airbus and Boeing dispute that emerged in 2004.

As part of the deal, the EU and the U.S. agreed to provide research and development funding through an open and transparent process as well as to not give specific support, such as tax breaks, to their own producers that would harm the other side.

The idea is also to collaborate in addressing nonmarket practices conducted by other countries, including China, which is developing its own civilian aircraft.

Tai said the tariffs on EU products would be suspended as long as government support for Airbus meets the agreement terms.

""Should EU support cross a red line and U.S. producers are not able to compete fairly and on a level playing field, the United States retains the flexibility to reactivate the tariffs that are being suspended,"" she said.

Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU's trade chief, said the agreement ""shows the new spirit of cooperation between the EU and the U.S. and that we can solve the other issues to our mutual benefit. Together we can deliver for our citizens and businesses."""

Update: On June 14, 2021, the United States and European Union (EU) agreed to suspend tariffs from the Boeing-Airbus trade dispute for an additional five years. The tariffs were initially suspended for a four-month period from March 2021 to July 2021.

Executive Summary

The United States and European Union (EU) have agreed to suspend tariffs from the Boeing-Airbus trade dispute for four months.

The tariffs, which were in effect from October 2019 to February 2021, have covered $12 billion of traded goods and cost the United States $1.6 billion.

The four-month suspension of these tariffs and possible future repeal will increase economic cooperation between the United States and the EU, which could help counter the economic influence of China.

Other major trade tensions remain between the United States and EU that could offset the added benefit from the repeal of these tariffs.

Introduction

On March 5, 2021, the United States and European Union (EU) agreed to a four-month suspension of tariffs that they originally imposed on each other in retaliation for the subsidies that they had given to their respective competing airplane manufacturers Boeing and Airbus. This announcement comes just days after the United States and the United Kingdom similarly agreed to suspend for four months the tariffs that stem from the same dispute. Taken as a whole, the tariffs covered almost $12 billion of traded goods annually. The United States has incurred a net additional cost burden of $1.6 billion due to the tariffs.

Due to the long and bitter nature of this trade dispute, the retaliatory tariffs have been chosen strategically to create economic damage and are not limited to the aircraft industry. The complete suspension of these tariffs thus serves as an economic boost for many sectors of the economy. The suspension also raises the hope of improved United States and EU trade relations, but there remain other disputes that are an obstacle to additional cooperation on trade issues.

The Boeing-Airbus Dispute

The conflict between Airbus and Boeing began in 2004, when the United States filed a complaint at the World Trade Organization (WTO) against the EU, which then filed its own complaint against the United States. Both alleged that illegal government subsidies gave the other’s airline manufacturer an unfair competitive advantage in international dealings. In 2010, the WTO finally ruled that both the EU and United States had engaged in illegal government subsidies. Both the United States and the EU contested the rulings but were unsuccessful in their appeals. By 2012, both sides claimed they had entered full compliance. Perhaps unsurprisingly, both nations challenged each other’s claims of compliance, starting a six-year legal battle.

In 2018, the WTO ruled that Airbus had continued with its unfair business practices and that Boeing had lost significant sales as a result. In response, the United States imposed tariffs on $7.5 billion of European goods. In 2019, the WTO similarly ruled Boeing had continued to receive illegal subsidies, and the EU imposed retaliatory tariffs on $4 billion worth of U.S. goods in November 2020.

Economic Impact of the Tariffs

The table below lists the approximate value of U.S. imports that are subject to the Boeing-Airbus tariffs. It additionally displays estimates of how much the United States has paid due to these tariffs.

Parts 1 and 19 are the only products related to aircraft. Parts 2 through 18 cover non-aircraft goods, including, but not limited to cheese, wine, scotch, and seafood. Parts 2 through 18 account for approximately two-thirds of the goods covered. The tariffs have so far covered $7.7 billion worth of goods and cost the United States $1.6 billion.

One might hope that EU prices would decline enough that when the tariffs are added on the ultimate price to U.S. users is unchanged. Unfortunately, prices tend to be sticky, at least in the short run. To the extent that prices have not adjusted since the tariffs went into effect in October 2019, U.S. importers will likely bear the burden; a burden that adds to the woes of industries that may have been hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. The complete revocation of these tariffs would therefore serve as an additional economic boost for different sectors of the economy.

An Excel file detailing the tariffs and the products they affect can be found here.

A Limited Increase in Economic Cooperation between the United States and EU

The joint temporary suspension of tariffs related to the Boeing-Airbus dispute marks the first major bilateral trade action between the Biden Administration and the EU. The U.S.-EU joint statement indicated the need to “ease the burden on their industries and workers.” It also indicated the need to rein in “trade distortive practices of and challenges posed by new entrants to the sector from non-market economies, such as China.” This note is significant because better trade cooperation between the United States and EU is essential to countering the economic influence of China.

While both sides agree on countering the growing economic influence of China, the United States and EU have other major trades disputes such as the Section 232 aluminum and steel tariffs. The justification for the steel and aluminum tariffs is largely the same as noted in their agreement, to combat unfair trade practices by China. Yet these tariffs are to remain in effect for the near future and come at a large cost for the United States and EU. This ongoing conflict suggests that a four-month suspension at the end of 16-year trade dispute will not be a panacea for U.S.-EU trade relations."
US and Europe end Airbus-Boeing dispute as they eye threat from China - CNN,"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMS8wNi8xNS9idXNpbmVzcy9ib2VpbmctYWlyYnVzLXRyYWRlLWRpc3B1dGUvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBR2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjEvMDYvMTUvYnVzaW5lc3MvYm9laW5nLWFpcmJ1cy10cmFkZS1kaXNwdXRl?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"London/Brussels CNN Business —

The United States and the European Union have resolved a long-running trade dispute over subsidies to Airbus and Boeing, a move that could improve transatlantic relations as both sides seek to counter China’s rising economic influence.

US officials confirmed on Tuesday they struck a truce to end the dispute over government subsidies for the world’s leading commercial plane makers during a summit in Brussels.

The two sides agreed to suspend tariffs imposed as part of the trade battle for a period of five years. They will also each release statements spelling out “acceptable support” for aircraft manufacturers.

The settlement “resolves a long standing trade irritant in the US-Europe relationship,” US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said. “Instead of fighting with one of our closest allies, we are finally coming together against a common threat.”

Tai said the US had reserved the right to reapply the tariffs if Europe doesn’t uphold its side of the deal. EU Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis and Tai have scheduled a news conference for 9 a.m. ET.

There were signs in recent months that the conflict over subsidies may be coming to a close after years of failed negotiations at the World Trade Organization. The United States, European Union and United Kingdom agreed in March to suspend related tariffs worth billions of dollars for four months.

The suspension marked a first step toward repairing a trade partnership that’s been strained for 17 years by the complaints about government support for Airbus (EADSF) and Boeing (BA).

The dispute dates to 2004, when EU authorities said Boeing had received $19 billion in unfair subsidies from federal and state governments. The United States filed a similar claim that year over European subsidies to Airbus.

The feud escalated when the Trump administration imposed tariffs on European goods including Parmesan cheese, French wine and Scotch and Irish whiskies. The European Union, in turn, slapped tariffs on US goods such as wine, cheese and suitcases.

The United States and European Union have still to resolve how to tax big tech companies and a dispute over Trump-era tariffs on steel and aluminum, but ending the aircraft subsidy fight should help improve relations as both sides put more emphasis on countering China.

“A renewed trade and investment partnership with the European Union is a top priority for the administration and our early efforts have been successful,” said Tai.

The United States joined the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Japan and Canada over the weekend to deliver the Group of Seven’s strongest condemnation of China in recent decades. The G7 statement took China to task over allegations of human rights abuses and political disputes over Hong Kong, Taiwan and the South China Sea. The world’s wealthiest democracies also pushed anew for an independent investigation into the origins of Covid-19, and promoted an alternative to China’s Belt and Road plan to boost its trading influence.

Later Tuesday, the United States and the European Union will follow that by announcing a joint council meant to address questions of trade and technology, a senior administration official told CNN, in part to provide a better check on China’s economic practices.

The task force is meant to “work together to write the rules of the road for the next generation, particularly in the areas of economics and emerging technologies,” the official said.

“We also have to take account of the fact that China poses a significant challenge in both of these areas, and dealing with China’s non-market practices, its economic abuses and, of course, efforts to shape the rules of the road on technology for the 21st century will be an important part of the work of this council and this fits with President Biden’s fundamental strategy,” the official said.

Biden is eager to restore transatlantic ties on his European tour this week, and is hoping to enter a high-stakes summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday appearing united with Western allies. That has mostly come in statements of support, but the trade dispute resolution is a concrete signal of his intent to normalize traditional US alliances after four years of strain."
United Airlines orders 70 Airbus A321neo aircraft - Airbus,"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0wNi11bml0ZWQtYWlybGluZXMtb3JkZXJzLTcwLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIxbmVvLWFpcmNyYWZ00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Premium single-aisle aircraft positions airline for growth

Herndon, Virginia, 29 June 2021 - United Airlines has placed an order for 70 Airbus A321neo aircraft, positioning the airline to grow its presence in the single-aisle market in alignment with its “United Next” initiative. The new order complements existing orders from United for 50 A321XLR aircraft, bringing the total commitment from the airline to 120 A321 aircraft.



“Such a significant order from a great airline like United underscores that the A321neo offers unmatched capabilities, operating economics, and passenger friendliness,” said Christian Scherer, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer and Head of International. “No other aircraft can do what the A321neo can do, and the Airbus team is most gratified by United’s strong affirmation of its premium status. The A321neo will complement United’s future A321XLR aircraft, together creating a privileged segment on its own.”

Another reason the A321neo is in such high demand globally is that the aircraft provides superior environmental performance with the lowest CO₂ emissions per seat in its class. The A321neo’s lower carbon footprint will support United along its journey to reduce the airline’s CO₂ emissions 100% by 2050.

United’s A321neo aircraft will feature Airbus’ Airspace cabin design, which brings the following passenger-pleasing enhancements: unique welcome and customizable hero lighting (which helps reduce jet lag); new slimmer sidewall panels for extra personal space at shoulder level; better views through the windows with their redesigned bezels and completely integrated window shades; the latest full LED lighting technologies; the largest overhead bin in class; and new lavatories with hygienic touchless features and antimicrobial surfaces.

A significant number of the newly-ordered aircraft will be produced at the Airbus U.S. Manufacturing Facility in Mobile, Alabama. Globally, as of the end of May 2021, the A320neo Family had achieved 7,400 firm orders from 121 customers.

2025 delivery confirmed for 2026 launch, return journey in 2030

Toulouse, 15 June 2021 – Airbus has passed an important milestone for the Earth Return Orbiter (ERO) mission, which will bring the first Mars samples back to Earth: it has passed the Preliminary Design Review with the European Space Agency (ESA) and with the participation of NASA.

With technical specifications and designs validated, suppliers from eight European countries are on board for nearly all components and sub-assemblies. Development and testing of equipments and sub-systems can now start to ensure the mission moves ahead on schedule.

“This PDR has been managed and closed in a record time of less than a year, an amazing achievement considering the complexity of the mission. The entire ERO team, including suppliers and agencies, has really pulled together and we are on target to achieve delivery in 2025 – only five and a half years after being selected as prime contractor” said Andreas Hammer, Head of Space Exploration at Airbus.

The next milestone will be the Critical Design Review in two years after which production and assembly will start, to secure delivery of the full spacecraft in 2025.

After launch in 2026, on an Ariane 64 launcher, the satellite will begin a five year mission to Mars, acting as a communication relay with the surface missions (including Perseverance and Sample Fetch Rovers), performing a rendezvous with the orbiting samples and bringing them safely back to Earth.

Dave Parker, Director of human and robotic exploration at ESA, said: “On behalf of all European citizens, I am proud to see ESA leading the first ever mission to return from Mars. As part of our strong cooperation with NASA, we are working to return pristine material from Mars – scientific treasure that the world’s scientists will study for generations to come and help reveal the history of the Red Planet”.

Airbus has overall responsibility for the ERO mission, developing the spacecraft in Toulouse, and conducting mission analysis in Stevenage. Thales Alenia Space will also have an important role, assembling the spacecraft, developing the communication system and providing the Orbit Insertion Module from its plant in Turin. Other suppliers come from Germany, France, UK, Italy, Spain, Norway, Denmark and The Netherlands.

The record development and design for ERO was only possible thanks to Airbus building on already mature and proven technologies, instead of developing brand new technologies with risk associated delays.

Proven Airbus technologies include the decades of experience in plasma (electric) propulsion, acquired through station keeping and in orbit operations of full electric telecom satellites, as well as its expertise on large solar arrays (telecoms and exploration missions, including JUICE, the biggest solar panels for an interplanetary mission until ERO) and complex planetary missions like BepiColombo, launched in 2018.

Airbus will also leverage its vision based navigation technological lead (RemoveDEBRIS, Automatic Air to Air refueling), and autonomous navigation expertise (Rosalind Franklin and Sample Fetch Rovers) and rendezvous and docking expertise built up over decades, using technologies from the successful ATV (Automated Transfer Vehicle) and recent developments from JUICE, Europe’s first mission to Jupiter.

The seven ton, seven metre high spacecraft, equipped with 144m² solar arrays with a span of over 40m – the largest ever built – will take about a year to reach Mars. It will use a mass-efficient hybrid propulsion system combining electric propulsion for the cruise and spiral down phases and chemical propulsion for Mars orbit insertion. Upon arrival, it will provide communications coverage for the NASA Perseverance Rover and Sample Retrieval Lander (SRL) missions, two essential parts of the Mars Sample Return campaign.

For the second part of its mission, ERO will have to detect, rendezvous with, and capture a basketball-size object called the Orbiting Sample (OS), which houses the sample tubes collected by the Sample Fetch Rover (SFR, also to be designed and built by Airbus); all this over 50 million km away from ground control.

Once captured, the OS will be bio-sealed in a secondary containment system and placed inside the Earth Entry Vehicle (EEV), effectively a third containment system, to ensure that the precious samples reach the Earth’s surface intact for maximum scientific return.

It will then take another year for ERO to make its way back to Earth, where it will send the EEV on a precision trajectory towards a pre-defined landing site, before itself entering into a stable orbit around the Sun.

Boeing-Airbus dispute: a truce in the air industry - Reuters,"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2dyYXBoaWNzL0VVLVVTQS9UUkFERS9qem52bndhZ3dwbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"BOEING-AIRBUS Boeing-Airbus dispute: a truce in the air industry

The United States and the European Union agreed on June 15 a truce in their near 17-year conflict over aircraft subsidies. The two sides have been battling since 2004 in parallel cases at the World Trade Organization over subsidies for U.S. planemaker Boeing (BA.N) and European rival Airbus (AIR.PA), which each argued exposed the other to unfair competition. On June 17, the United States and Britain reached a similar agreement to resolve their dispute over aid for Boeing and Airbus and focus on tackling Chinese subsidies, echoing the five-year tariff truce announced by Washington and Brussels. The announcements come at a moment in which the aerospace industry is wrestling with the reluctance of most airlines to take delivery of jets as they struggle to save cash, and a drop in air traffic that Airbus says could take until 2023 or 2025 to regain the pre-pandemic levels of 2019. In the same context, China aims to challenge Boeing and Airbus with the development of its own single-aisle plane.

In 2020, Airbus delivered 566 aircraft, a 34% drop from 2019. This was the end to 17 years of consecutive record production. In the same period, Boeing delivered 157 aircraft, a 57% less than in 2019 and just 20% of 2018’s record production of 806. Beyond the effects of the pandemic felt across the whole industry, the grounding of the 737 MAX weighed heavily on Boeing deliveries last year.

At the same time, the revenue passenger miles —the metric that shows the number of miles traveled by paying passengers in the air industry— dropped dramatically in 2020 as a consequence of the pandemic after years of sustained grow with consecutive annual records since the 2008–09 financial crisis. Global airlines reported losses of about $370 billion.

The two companies have been for decades the two main competitors in the market of commercial aircrafts. Although the underlying trade relationship remains fragile with many unresolved disagreements, according to diplomats and trade experts, both companies agreed to set aside tariffs to focus on fighting China’s clear ambition to build and sell its own commercial aircraft. Industry sources told Reuters that United Airlines (UAL.O) is in talks to buy around 200 single-aisle jets in a multibillion-dollar revamp set to benefit both Boeing (BA.N) and Airbus (AIR.PA).

The C919 is designed to compete with the Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus 320neo families. Russia is mounting a similar challenge with its MS-21 and Brazil’s Embraer is established in the market for slightly smaller jets. Experts say China’s COMAC is a future third option in the market for planes with more than 100 seats due to Beijing’s finances and the size of its domestic market.

The United States and the European Union agreed to end a damaging dispute over subsidies to lift billions of dollars in punitive tariffs linked to Airbus and Boeing subsidies.

U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the two sides have come to terms on a five-year agreement to suspend the tariffs at the center of the dispute. She said they could be reimplemented if U.S. companies are not able to “compete fairly” with those in Europe.

“Today’s announcement resolves a long-standing irritant in the U.S.-EU relationship,” Tai said, as President Joe Biden met with EU leaders in Brussels. “Instead of fighting with one of our closest allies, we are finally coming together against a common threat.”

The trade dispute skyrocketed under the Trump administration, and saw tit-for-tat duties slapped on a range of companies that have nothing to do with aircraft production, from French winemakers to German cookie bakers in Europe and U.S. spirits producers in the United States, among many others.

The U.S. imposed what could have amounted to $7.5 billion in tariffs on European exports in 2019 after the World Trade Organization ruled that the EU had not complied with its rulings on subsidies for Airbus, which is based in France. The EU retaliated last November with up to $4 billion in punitive duties after the WTO ruled that the U.S. had provided illegal subsidies to Seattle-based Boeing.

In March, weeks after Biden had taken office, the two sides agreed to suspend the tariffs. That suspension started on March 11 for four months. The new agreement will officially go into effect on July 11.

US, EU also reached 'mutual understanding' on supporting aircraft industries 03:05

“This really opens a new chapter in our relationship because we move from litigation to cooperation on aircraft — after 17 years of dispute,” said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

Both sides said they would also work together to analyze and address the “non-market practices of third parties that may harm our large civil aircraft sectors,” according to the EU's executive branch.

Tai said they would cooperate “to challenge and counter China’s non-market practices in this sector in specific ways that reflect our standards for fair competition.”

‘A level playing field’

Airbus, which is headquartered in France but also has centers in Germany and Spain, welcomed the agreement.

“This will provide the basis to create a level playing field which we have advocated for since the start of this dispute. It will also avoid lose-lose tariffs that are only adding to the many challenges that our industry faces,” an Airbus spokesperson said in a statement.

France's finance and European affairs ministers also hailed the deal.

""We are now going to be able to focus on finally putting these differences behind us, and to define the conditions for fair competition on a global scale to support the aerospace sector, which is strategic for both Europe and the United States,"" they said in a joint statement.

Despite the breakthrough, the deal does not end the Trump-era trans-Atlantic trade row. The former U.S. president also slapped duties on EU steel and aluminum. That move enraged European countries, most of them NATO allies, because it was justified as a measure to protect U.S. national security.

The so-called Article 232 proceeding both hurts European producers and raises the cost of steel for American companies. The EU retaliated by raising tariffs on products like U.S.-made motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans.

Is the trade dispute between America and Europe over Airbus and Boeing over? - The Economist,"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lY29ub21pc3QuY29tL3RoZS1lY29ub21pc3QtZXhwbGFpbnMvMjAyMS8wNi8xNy9pcy10aGUtdHJhZGUtZGlzcHV0ZS1iZXR3ZWVuLWFtZXJpY2EtYW5kLWV1cm9wZS1vdmVyLWFpcmJ1cy1hbmQtYm9laW5nLW92ZXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"IT IS THE longest trade dispute in the history of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and its predecessors. America and the European Union have been fighting for 17 years over subsidies provided to Boeing, an American planemaker, and its European arch-rival, Airbus. But is an end to the tussle in sight? On June 15th, amid the hubbub of President Joe Biden’s first trip to Europe, America and the EU signed an agreement to prevent the dispute, and the associated retaliatory measures, from escalating into a broader trade war. Two days later America and Britain, where some Airbus factories are based, agreed on a similar deal. What is behind the dispute? And do the deals really end it?

The battle began in 2004, the year after Airbus first overtook Boeing in aircraft deliveries. America ripped up a previous understanding on subsidies for large civil aircraft manufacturers after Boeing complained that its rival unfairly received what grew to become $22bn in repayable “launch aid” to develop new airliners. Airbus and the EU soon hit back with their own claim, stating that Boeing’s commercial operations had benefited from generous military contracts as well as tax breaks worth $24bn. The WTO eventually ruled in the two parallel cases that both firms had received illegal subsidies. In 2019 it awarded America the right to slap tariffs worth $7.5bn on European goods. It also gave the EU the right to impose tariffs worth $4bn on American products ranging from planes to Harley-Davidson motorcycles.

The dispute has dragged on for two main reasons. The first is the sheer complexity of the case. It has taken the WTO much longer to work out whether subsidies robbed each party of aircraft orders than it would have done to rule on the average trade case. This is because the market for airliners is so different from the sort of commodity goods, such as steel or aluminium, that trade cases are usually fought over. The second was the determination of the two sides to push litigation at the WTO as far as possible—a sign of how strong the lobbying power of Airbus and Boeing used to be. A deal only became a serious possibility after the election of Joe Biden, who is keen to strengthen America’s alliance with Europe in the face of threats from China and Russia. Both countries have taken advantage of 17 years of bickering between America and Europe to dish out subsidies of their own worth tens of billions of dollars, helping national champions develop jets to take on Airbus and Boeing.

Even so, the deal defers the dispute rather than ending it. The retaliatory tariffs arising from the WTO litigation will be suspended for five years. State financing “on market terms” (ie, broadly on borrowing terms available from private-sector lenders) for the development and production of airliners will still be allowed, while a working group led by American and European trade ministers attempts to reach a final understanding about past and future subsidies. It is a sign that neither side appears to believe that large commercial aircraft can ever be built on fully commercial terms. But the two sides remain far apart on what exactly counts as “market terms” and what a final agreement on subsidies should look like. Without any detailed rules on what handouts are and aren’t allowed, the efforts of China and Russia to build planes to compete with Airbus and Boeing will continue unhindered this decade. That certainly was not the outcome that America and Boeing were seeking when they started the dispute in 2004."
Truce on Airbus/Boeing subsidies lets sides focus on emerging competitor - Marketplace,"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHBsYWNlLm9yZy8yMDIxLzA2LzE1L3RydWNlLW9uLWFpcmJ1cy1ib2Vpbmctc3Vic2lkaWVzLWxldHMtc2lkZXMtZm9jdXMtb24tZW1lcmdpbmctY29tcGV0aXRvci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In Brussels, the United States and the European Union agreed to end their long-running dispute over subsidies to homegrown aircraft makers Boeing and Airbus, a deal that suspends billions of dollars in punitive tariffs. The truce not only turns a page on trans-Atlantic trade relations, but it could direct the two sides’ attention to Chinese competition in the commercial aircraft industry.

For more than a decade, the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China has developed a domestic jet — the C919 — designed to rival the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. The C919 could be certified by domestic regulators as early as this year.

Still, China’s commercial jet sector faces multiple challenges. For one, its full-size passenger aircraft relies heavily on imported technology.

“Everything on that plane that keeps it in the air is either from the United States or from Europe,” said Scott Kennedy, Chinese business and economics scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Not a single component that is central to the plane’s flight is from China.”

Another challenge: maintenance and service, which make up the vast majority of costs over the life of a commercial plane.

“The hardest part isn’t making the physical aircraft,” said Kevin Michaels, managing director at the consultancy AeroDynamic Advisory. “These are productivity machines that must operate 365 days a year. That’s the hardest part.”

This is why most countries that have tried to join the Boeing-Airbus party have found themselves … grounded.

“It’s really hard to break into that market,” said Richard Bitzinger, visiting senior fellow at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University. “The Koreans have tried to do it, the Japanese, the Russians. I mean, it’s an elephant’s graveyard.”

Optimistically, the Chinese passenger plane could sell well in the huge China market — given home-company preference — potentially forcing out Boeing and/or Airbus. Tuesday’s truce between the U.S. and EU could enable the two governments to counter Beijing’s tactics together, if they have to.

“Without a common agreement between the U.S. or Europe, either of them individually has very little chance of holding China accountable to a level playing field,” said Chad Ohlandt, aeronautical engineer at the Rand Corp. think tank.

Historically, Ohlandt said, commercial aviation has had space for only two big manufacturers. So if Boeing or Airbus slip up in the future, it could create an opening for China.

Keep in mind: This is a country that has made great strides in manufacturing and electronics, building bullet trains and landing its spacecraft on Mars."

Airbus gains first Flight Hour Services contract in North America with JetBlue for its A220 fleet - Airbus Aircraft,"Thu, 03 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vYWlyY3JhZnQuYWlyYnVzLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzcm9vbS9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlcy8yMDIxLTA2LWFpcmJ1cy1nYWlucy1maXJzdC1mbGlnaHQtaG91ci1zZXJ2aWNlcy1jb250cmFjdC1pbi1ub3J0aC1hbWVyaWPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Toulouse, 3 June 2021 – Airbus has signed its first Flight Hour Services (FHS) contract with a North American customer. U.S.-based airline JetBlue is acquiring long-term Airbus components maintenance services for its 70 A220 aircraft on order. The A220 started operations with JetBlue in April 2021.

The maintenance-by-the-hour service contract includes material services with on-site-parts stock management, as well as access to Airbus’ pool of parts, engineering and repair services.

“As for all Airbus aircraft programmes, A220 customers are benefitting from Airbus’ renowned maintenance FHS programme. We are extremely proud to welcome JetBlue as our first FHS customer in North America and be able to further increase its A220 fleet’s availability in support of traffic resuming”, said Dominik Wacht, Head of Airbus Customer Services, North America.

“With a substantially lower direct operating cost over other aircraft in our fleet from both fuel and non-fuel savings, the A220 also helps further reset JetBlue's maintenance costs well into the decade,” said Bill Cade, Vice President Technical Operations, JetBlue.

“Airbus’ FHS solution helps support our long-term financial goals as they relate to maintenance and supports our ability to offer low fares and award-winning service to more JetBlue customers.”

Bill Cade, Vice President Technical Operations, JetBlue.

JetBlue will be the third A220 airline operator to use Airbus’ FHS service. Over 150 A220s have been delivered to nine airlines operating routes in Asia, America, Europe and Africa, proving the great versatility of Airbus’ latest family member.

This first FHS contract for Airbus in North America confirms the growing expansion of Airbus’ maintenance-by-the-hour solution to accompany traffic restart: over the last six months, eleven FHS contracts have been signed with operators worldwide."
"U.S., EU end Airbus- Boeing trade dispute - The Washington Post","Tue, 15 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy9iaWRlbi1ldS10YXJpZmZzLzIwMjEvMDYvMTUvODhmY2ZlOTItY2Q0Yy0xMWViLWE3ZjEtNTJiODg3MGJlZjdjX3N0b3J5Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"BRUSSELS — President Biden and European Union leaders reached a deal Tuesday to put to rest a 17-year-old trade dispute about subsidies for aircraft manufacturers, officials said, a significant step in calming trade relations after the fury of the Trump years. A five-year truce, which was announced at a meeting Tuesday in Brussels between Biden and the top leaders of E.U. institutions, was the latest effort in a transatlantic reconciliation tour that the new president started last week at the Group of Seven summit in Britain.

At each stop, including at NATO on Monday, Biden has tried to mend ties that were damaged under President Donald Trump, who often drew close to traditional American adversaries and targeted longtime allies with vitriol.

“It’s overwhelmingly the interest of the United States of America to have a great relationship with NATO and the E.U.,” Biden said Tuesday as he started the meeting with E.U. leaders. “I have a very different view than my predecessor did.”

Tuesday’s deal will quell fears that the E.U. and the United States could hit each other with tariffs on goods as varied as French wine and Harley-Davidson motorcycles, as they did in recent years as part of the airplane subsidy dispute, which involves Boeing and Airbus.

“Today’s announcement resolves a long-standing trade irritant in the U.S.-Europe relationship,” said U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai. “Instead of fighting with one of our closest allies, we are finally coming together against a common threat.”

Europe also welcomed the deal.

“This meeting started with a breakthrough on aircraft,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement. “The agreement we have found now really opens a new chapter in our relationship because we move from litigation to cooperation on aircraft . . . after almost 20 years of trade disputes.”

But as was the case in Biden’s earlier stops on his first international trip as president, lingering irritants from the Trump years remained unresolved after Tuesday’s E.U. meeting, a sign that elements of Trump’s foreign policy may outlast him. Biden did not remove tariffs that Trump imposed on European steel, a major frustration for the E.U., nor did he announce plans to remove pandemic-era restrictions on travel from Europe to the United States, even though the E.U. has made plans to reopen to visitors from the United States. The White House has said both issues need a bit more time.

Biden on Wednesday will wrap up his European tour with a meeting in Geneva with Russian President Vladimir Putin, promising to deliver a far tougher message to the Kremlin than the one from Trump, who sought Putin’s approval and friendship.

In Biden’s talks with von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel, the U.S. president sought to move from antagonism to accord.

Under the terms of the E.U.-U.S. deal on airplane manufacturers, the two sides agreed to put aside differences in their battle over government financial aid for rivals Boeing and Airbus. The truce will suspend tariffs related to the dispute for five years, Tai said.

The two sides released a two-page “understanding on a cooperative framework” that commits them to funding production and development of large commercial jets “on market terms.” They also pledged to provide government research funds for new aircraft programs through an “open and transparent process” without causing “negative effects to the other side.”

Any implementation disagreements are to be resolved through quiet bargaining in a new working group.

Tai told reporters that the “revolutionary” agreement would enable the United States and its European allies to collaborate on meeting the common threat of a burgeoning Chinese commercial aircraft industry.

Although China has struggled for a quarter-century to master the complex industrial challenge of fielding a homegrown rival to Airbus and Boeing, it has made sufficient strides in recent years to threaten aircraft makers’ hopes for continuing large sales in the Chinese market.

“China’s plan for aircraft is less about global competition and more about indigenous substitution: They seem to be preparing for a future where China has decoupled from the West,” said Richard Aboulafia, vice president for analysis for the Teal Group, an aviation consultancy.

China has risen to dominate industries such as steelmaking, shipbuilding and solar panel production, through the use of generous subsidies for state-owned companies. Officials want to team up to address the potential threat of Beijing’s employing similar strategies in the aircraft sector.

“It positions the U.S. and E.U. in a cooperative position. For about 20 years, we have been at each other’s throat,” Tai told reporters. “We need to work together to counteract aggressive, nonmarket policies that are going to threaten our industries.”

Still, Tai and Valdis Dombrovskis, a European Commission executive vice president, acknowledged that some of the details of Tuesday’s agreement remain to be worked out over the next five years in the joint working group.

“I’m confident that five years’ time is sufficient to build trust and confidence on both sides so we can then put this dispute definitely to rest,” Dombrovskis said.

Tai contrasted the Biden administration’s collaborative approach toward the E.U. with the Trump administration’s tariff-first stance. U.S. officials “put away our litigation briefcases” and agreed to discuss a common approach to China’s use of nonmarket strategies, she said.

The World Trade Organization in 2019 authorized the United States to impose tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of European goods in response to illegal European aircraft subsidies. The E.U. retaliated with its own levies on $4 billion of U.S. products, including whiskey, molasses and motorcycles.

“This deal will shore up the longer-term competitiveness and innovation of a key sector, aircraft, that is one of the most important sources of middle-class jobs at home,” Tai said.

In another nod toward shared interests, the United States and the E.U. announced a cooperative trade and technology council, which could help the allies shape global standards for digital innovations and fight back against “China’s nonmarket practices.”

E.U. and U.S. officials also have been working toward an agreement to address Trump’s tariffs on industrial metals and Europe’s retaliatory levies on U.S. goods. But a resolution on that remained out of reach Tuesday, and the two sides agreed to keep talking.

Last month, the E.U. suspended plans to impose additional countermeasures on $3.8 billion of U.S. products in a bid to pave the way for progress in that dispute.

“We have to de-escalate and solve E.U.-U.S. trade disputes,” Dombrovskis, the bloc’s top trade official, told the European Parliament last week.

The two sides have said they will work toward lifting the metals tariffs by Dec. 1. Asked at a news conference Sunday to justify continuing what are known as Section 232 tariffs amid his calls for transatlantic harmony, Biden suggested a willingness to eliminate them.

“A hundred and twenty days. Give me a break. Need time,” he replied, understating the number of days since his inauguration.

The metals tariffs are popular with Biden’s labor allies in the United Steelworkers union. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo praised the levies earlier this year, saying they “helped save American jobs.”

Europeans view them with particular frustration because they were imposed under U.S. rules that allow the president to address national security threats. E.U. leaders say their countries are allies, not a danger to U.S. national security.

“It was good to hear that the U.S. clearly agrees with us that the European Union is not a national security threat, so we are happy about that,” von der Leyen said. She said the E.U. had suspended its countertariffs for six months to create “space” for a solution and said that any resolution needs to occur before the suspension ends.

Officials said they wanted to end the dispute quickly.

“People standing around the world and looking at us fighting in the past few years, when we did, you know they pop open bottles of champagne when that happens,” the E.U. ambassador to the United States, Stavros Lambrinidis, said last week at the German Marshall Fund in a preview of Biden’s trip.

Removing the tariffs is likely to require eventual agreement to address the global surplus in steel and aluminum production that the Trump administration cited as a reason for imposing the measures in 2018.

That won’t be easy: 30 nations have been holding talks on the issue for five years with little to show for them.

Still, the mood surrounding Biden’s European talks is certain to be seen as an improvement over the recent past. Trump, who often complained that “Europe treats us worse than China,” irritated European leaders with harsh criticism of their trade practices and even threatened to impose steep tariffs on U.S. imports of German automobiles.

Tuesday’s discussions will not eliminate transatlantic trade frictions. U.S. technology companies already are gearing up to oppose an E.U. legislative proposal that would impose controls on the operations of the largest online platforms. The Digital Markets Act would impose especially tough rules on American Internet giants such as Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft.

“I think we’ll hear confirmation the two sides are continuing to work on certain trade issues, working to resolve Boeing-Airbus and the [Section] 232 tariffs. But I am concerned there are other looming issues, like the Digital Markets Act, that mean we haven’t seen the true conflict even start yet,” said Jamieson Greer, a partner at King & Spalding law firm and a former top trade official in the Trump administration."
Airbus designs inflight Covid quarantine tent - CNN,"Mon, 21 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2FydGljbGUvYWlyYnVzLXBheGNhc2UtaW5mbGlnaHQtcXVhcmFudGluZS1jb25jZXB0L2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAVFodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi90cmF2ZWwvYXJ0aWNsZS9haXJidXMtcGF4Y2FzZS1pbmZsaWdodC1xdWFyYW50aW5lLWNvbmNlcHQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CNN —

As more airplanes return to the skies, airports and airlines continue to enforce measures designed to keep passengers as safe as possible while Covid-19 remains a problem.

But even though face masks and temperature checks are commonplace – as are destination requirements for proof of vaccination or negative test – there’s still a possibility that a passenger could develop Covid symptoms mid-flight.

On a packed airplane, it can be tricky to actually isolate a symptomatic traveler in line with the two-meter distance recommended by global aviation body IATA and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

That’s what Airbus’ PaxCASE (Passenger Containment Area for Symptomatic Events) concept is intended for – its semi-transparent plastic sheeting encircles a potentially infectious passenger in an isolation bubble.

Ingo Wuggetzer, vice president of cabin marketing at Airbus, tells CNN Travel that PaxCASE is designed to either be in a fixed position in the airplane cabin – on a kind of curtain rail – or work as removable sheeting, to be fixed into place on the ceiling by strong tape.

The barrier would encircle one seat row, cutting off three seats – including the one occupied by the symptomatic passenger.

“It’s a very simple, easy principle, applied by the crew in case in case of emergency need,” explains Wuggetzer.

The concept has been nominated in the Clean and Safe Air Travel category in the 2021 Crystal Cabin Awards, which focus on the latest trends in airplane interior innovation.

The Crystal Cabin Awards usually has eight categories, but this year is focused on two key awards that recognize where aviation is right now: the Clean and Safe Air Travel category and the Judges Choice category.

Real time response

In spring 2020, the continuing global spread of Covid-19 and the ensuing shutdown of the aviation industry prompted a wave of airplane seat and cabin innovation.

“There was a kind of real panic because of the crisis, what to do and what can we do,” says Wuggetzer.

Wuggetzer says Airbus dreamed up PaxCASE during that period – as the pandemic ground global air travel to a halt, Airbus designers took to the drawing board to come up with some new concepts for safe flying.

“We created, I think, more than 2,000 ideas,” recalls Wuggetzer.

Airbus representatives then spoke to airlines about some of the strongest concepts, with PaxCASE among them.

A year or so later, most of the more high-spec concepts that hit the headlines have not materialized.

Wuggetzer points out that much has changed since spring 2020. For one, there’s more understanding of how the virus works and how it spreads. Plus, vaccines and testing are more widely available, at least in some markets.

The goal is that current worldwide government and airline restrictions will sift out infectious passengers before they end up sat next to you on a plane.

IATA stipulates that “the risk of contracting Covid-19, when wearing a mask on board, is very low.”

So while PaxCASE might be a hit with the Crystal Cabin Awards judges, airlines aren’t currently expressing much interest in the isolation device.

“I would say [it is] more in the end of the priority list,” says Wuggetzer. “Essentially, nobody wants it, and to be honest I think nobody wants to use it for sure.”

Instead, Wuggetzer says airlines are focused on making the in-flight experience as touch-free as possible, and are particularly interested in coating cabin surfaces with antimicrobial polishes.

Such solutions are also appealing because they don’t involve retrofitting or redesigning a whole cabin.

The only downside, suggests Wuggetzer, is these concepts aren’t visually striking, and therefore might be less apparent to passengers than, say, large dividing screens, or flashy new airplane seats.

Airbus is currently working on ways to advertize the less visible changes to passengers, to reassure travelers.

“Safe and simple”

While PaxCASE isn’t in high demand, the design’s recognition from the Crystal Cabin Awards suggests it does have legs.

“If you have a real problem, then this solution clearly provides a safe and simple way to deal with it, and I think that is why it’s in there,” says Wuggetzer, who also serves on the Crystal Cabin judging panel. Naturally he can’t vote for any Airbus designs.

It’s been exciting, Wuggetzer says, to see the nominated solutions for a safe travel experience, especially in a year when the aviation industry has tightened its belt.

“A lot of companies really laid off people and reduced their efforts in pushing innovations, so I think of a number of entries, we have been quite surprised,” he says.

Other notable nominees include Alejandro Núñez Vicentes Chaise Longue Economy Seat project, which envisages a dual-level seat cabin, with each row alternating between on-floor seating, and seats elevated a few feet above ground.

The full list of this year’s Crystal Cabin Awards nominees can be viewed here. Winners are expected to be announced at this year’s Aircraft Interiors Expo, which will take place virtually in September 2021."
"United is buying 270 Boeing and Airbus jets, its largest-ever order, for post-Covid growth plan - CNBC","Tue, 29 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvMjkvdW5pdGVkLWFpcmxpbmVzLXVudmVpbHMtMjcwLWpldC1ib2VpbmctYW5kLWFpcmJ1cy1vcmRlci1pdHMtbGFyZ2VzdC1ldmVyLmh0bWzSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMS8wNi8yOS91bml0ZWQtYWlybGluZXMtdW52ZWlscy0yNzAtamV0LWJvZWluZy1hbmQtYWlyYnVzLW9yZGVyLWl0cy1sYXJnZXN0LWV2ZXIuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"United Airlines unveiled Tuesday its largest-ever aircraft order: 270 narrow-body jetliners from Boeing and Airbus as the carrier charts its post-pandemic growth.

The fleet plan is central to United's goal of capturing more travelers, particularly high-paying ones in major coastal hubs like San Francisco and Newark, New Jersey. The Max 10 and A321neo planes are the largest models in their families and United will use them to grow in those markets, which have capacity constraints, said Andrew Nocella, United's chief commercial officer.

It also plans to expand in hubs like Denver and Chicago and have annual systemwide growth of about 4% to 6% in the next few years, Nocella said.

In a wide-ranging growth plan, the airline said it plans to add more roomier seats and seatback entertainment, a departure from a previous strategy.

The airline also announced a hiring spree that it expects to total about 25,000 employees for the new planes, including pilots, flight attendants and mechanics.

The order shows United's optimism about the recovery in air travel, which so far has been concentrated in domestic leisure flights. United said Monday it expects to post positive, adjusted pretax income next month for the first time since January 2020.

United and other airlines took $54 billion in federal payroll aid in exchange for keeping workers employed. CEO Scott Kirby said the airline's strategy that kept pilots trained and flying similar planes allowed it to be ready for the demand rebound.

Boeing shares lost 1.8% to end at $235.76 and United's fell 0.7% to $52.15, while the S&P 500 ended less than 0.1% higher. Several analysts had expected the airline to announce a large order.

The order includes 200 Boeing Max jets. Of those planes, 150 are Max 10s, the largest in the family. Boeing completed the first Max 10 test flight earlier this month.

The remaining 50 Boeing planes are the manufacturer's most-popular model, the Max 8.

The large purchase on top of United's existing order book for Max planes is another vote of confidence in the airplane maker, which has struggled to regain its footing after two Max crashes and several production problems.

United also plans to buy 70 Airbus 321neos, adding to an order for dozens of the long-range version of the plane.

The sale is worth more than $30 billion at list prices, but airlines, particularly for large orders, generally receive substantial discounts. United declined to disclose what it is spending on the aircraft. The order is likely closer to $15 billion, estimated Rob Morris, global head of consultancy at Ascend by Cirium, which appraises aircraft and provides a host of other industry data.

The carrier now has about 500 narrow-body aircraft arriving starting next year.

About 200 of the planes will be used to grow the airline's fleet of 500 aircraft, while 300 will go to replace older jets such as its Boeing 757-200 planes, which it will retire, said Nocella."

Air Force Begins Search For New Refueling Tanker as Lawmakers Push Airbus - Defense One,"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VvbmUuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjEvMDYvYWlyLWZvcmNlLWJlZ2lucy1zZWFyY2gtbmV3LXJlZnVlbGluZy10YW5rZXItbGF3bWFrZXJzLXB1c2gtYWlyYnVzLzE3NDc4Ny_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The U.S. Air Force has begun its search for as many as 160 new refueling tankers. The contest, a long-planned follow-on to the competition that produced the troubled Boeing KC-46, may be Airbus’ best chance yet to win a foothold in the American strategic tanker market.

The contest for what the military is calling a “bridge tanker” kicked off the same week President Biden and the European Union called a five-year truce in a 17-year-old trade battle over state subsidies allegedly given to the U.S. and European planemakers—and as some U.S. lawmakers say it’s time to give Airbus a role in the U.S. strategic refueling mission.

The Air Force said in a contracting notice posted Wednesday that it wants to buy between 140 and 160 new tankers—at a rate of 12 to 15 aircraft per year—that are based on a commercial aircraft design.

“The Commercial Derivative Aircraft must be operational by 2029,” the notice states. “The Air Force is still finalizing the requirements for this acquisition.”

Boeing and Airbus are the only makers of new, jet-powered, strategic refueling planes. Boeing’s KC-46 is based on the 767 airliner, while Airbus’ Multi-Role Tanker Transport, or MRTT, is based on the A330. Lockheed Martin and Embraer make smaller, tactical refueling aircraft.

Airbus has partnered with U.S. defense giant Lockheed Martin, which said it intends to respond to the Air Force’s request.

“We are responding to the U.S. Air Force’s Sources Sought Notification for the Bridge Tanker Program, offering a mission-ready solution to meet the Air Force’s future tanker requirements,” Rob Fuller, a Lockheed Martin spokesman, said in a statement.

Airbus has sought unsuccessfully for two decades to break into the Air Force’s strategic tanker market. It had partnered with Northrop Grumman, beating Boeing in a 2008 contest, only to have the contract overturned by government auditors. In a recompete, Airbus bid on its own, and lost to Boeing.

Now, 10 years since the Air Force chose the KC-46 over the Airbus MRTT, Boeing has lost more than $5 billion on the project and is years behind schedule due to design, technical, and quality control problems. The terms of the contract require Boeing, not taxpayers, to eat the cost overruns.

The company must replace key cameras and software that are part of the KC-46 refueling system. Additionally, the Air Force is paying Boeing $100 million to redesign the tanker’s refueling boom so it can refuel all types of military aircraft.

Despite the shortcomings, the Air Force has started using the plane for non-combat missions including refueling aircraft, aeromedical evacuations, and flying passengers and cargo. Air Force officials anticipate the plane being war-ready in late 2023.

The new bridge tanker, also known as KC-Y, has long been planned by the Air Force as the follow-on to the KC-46. It’s called the bridge tanker because it’s the second of a three-phased recapitalization of the Air Force’s aerial refueling aircraft.

Boeing said it plans to enter the KC-46 in the new bridge tanker contest.

“With 102 aircraft on order, and growing international interest, Boeing’s KC-46A is proven and matured for the next stage of combat air refueling capabilities and airborne battle management, which will extend the Air Force’s ability to deliver critical fuel and information for decades to come,” Deborah VanNierop, a Boeing spokeswoman, said in a statement.

At a House Armed Services Committee hearing Wednesday, some lawmakers, including Airbus allies, pushed Air Force leaders to consider canceling the current Boeing KC-46 contract, which calls for buying 179 aircraft, early.

“I would strongly urge you to look at recompeting,” said Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Va.

Air Force leaders said they would prefer to complete the current KC-46 buy before moving to the bridge tanker.

“We're concerned that if we try to go into a new contractual vehicle, that would put additional delays into the program that we simply don't think would be efficacious for us,” acting Air Force Secretary John Roth said.

Despite losing the Air Force tanker contest in 2011, Airbus followed through with plans to assemble aircraft in the United States. The company in 2015 opened a factory in Mobile, Alabama, that today builds dozens of A319, A320, A321, and A220 commercial airliners annually.

The KC-46 has been replacing KC-10 tankers that date back to the 1980s and even older Eisenhower-era KC-135.

“I'm worried about our Air Force, and our refueling possibilities of our aging aircraft, it is a huge issue that I think we really need to push to the front of profits of anybody,” Rep. Jerry Carl, R-Ala., said at Wednesday’s hearing. Airbus builds commercial aircraft in Carl’s district."

United Airlines has scheduled of two public events for Tuesday raising expectations it will announce orders for more than 200 new Airbus and Boeing planes, an aviation industry expert said on Monday.

The big carrier invited reporters to Newark Airport to join Chief Executive Scott Kirby on Tuesday morning for an event focused on ""the future of our airline,"" according to an invitation sent last week.

The company also is hosting an investor event on its website Tuesday.

""They could announce an order of 200 to 300 planes,"" said Michel Merluzeau, analyst at AIR, an industry consultancy, who expects an agreement to include the Boeing 737 MAX and 787, and the Airbus A321neo.

United, Boeing and Airbus all declined comment.

""It's clear that United needs to refresh many planes, especially the older A320s,"" Merluzeau told AFP.

The United events Tuesday come as US carriers finally are beginning to see signs of a strong turnaround after the coronavirus shut down travel and devastated the industry for more than a year.

Still United and other major carriers are expected to report another quarterly loss for the April-June period.

Richard Aboulafia, an aviation expert at Teal Group, said purchases of the A321 and the 737 MAX—both single-aisle planes—would make sense for the airline in the current market.

""The domestic markets are coming back pretty fast and fuel prices are coming back fast too,"" Aboulafia said.

Airlines must make long-term bets to remain competitive, even if current market conditions still present significant problems, Aboulafia said, adding that current low interest rates also encourage making purchases now.

""The mix of cheap cash and expensive fuel, that makes for good orders,"" he said.

Who is the mystery buyer of Airbus C295 aircraft? - Defense News,"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9nbG9iYWwvYXNpYS1wYWNpZmljLzIwMjEvMDYvMjQvd2hvLWlzLXRoZS1teXN0ZXJ5LWJ1eWVyLW9mLWFpcmJ1cy1jMjk1LWFpcmNyYWZ0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Correction: This story has been updated to clarify the potential customers of the Airbus C295, now only including Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam.

MELBOURNE, Australia — Airbus is selling its C295 tactical airlifter to a mystery Southeast Asian customer and is fulfilling a follow-on order for Thailand, the company announced Monday.

The European aircraft manufacturer announced the sale of an additional C295 to Thailand for its Army. The aircraft will be delivered in 2023, outfitted in a utility transport configuration, although no contract values were disclosed in the announcement for either buy. The announcement also mentioned a recent sale of three aircraft to an “undisclosed military customer in the region.”

Johan Pelissier, the head of Airbus Defence and Space’s Asia-Pacific business activity, said that “the C295 is gaining popularity in Asia-Pacific due to its modularity, maneuverability and endurance capability,” adding that “the low cost of operation compared to any other platform of its class makes it a good prospect for the militaries.”

Industry sources tell Defense News that in this case, the “Asia-Pacific” region refers specifically to Southeast Asia instead of the wider geographic region. The sources added the customer was already existing customer of the C295, narrowing the mystery buyer down to Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam.

The secrecy suggests that the customer is likely to be Vietnam, which already operates three C295s ordered in 2014, having retired its Russian-built Antonov An-26 transports.

Vietnam’s existing C295s serve alongside a similar number of CASA/IPTN NC-212 light transport aircraft, and the addition of three more aircraft would represent a significant improvement to its airlift capability.

The country is a claimant to the disputed Spratly and Paracel islands in the South China Sea, and the C295 would come in use in resupplying several outposts Vietnam maintains on the islands, as well as in other roles such as humanitarian disaster relief.

In addition to the aforementioned Southeast Asian air forces, another 28 air forces operate the type or have it on order, including Canada, Egypt and Spain. The type is available as the C295M or improved C295W transport, as well as the C295 Persuader maritime patrol aircraft.

European aircraft manufacturer Airbus said its local partner has started the fuselage-equipping project of the A320 family aircraft in Tianjin on Tuesday.

The first China-equipped fuselage will be delivered in the third quarter of this year.

The project, undertaken by Xi'an Aircraft International (Tianjin) Corp (XAT) and by local Chinese staff members, marks a new industrial cooperation milestone between Airbus and China.

Large parts and the internal system components of A320 fuselage will be transported from Europe to Tianjin to complete the final assembly work, according to the agreement.

""Since the signing of the contract in 2019, XAT quickly set up a fuselage development team, and together with Airbus' German and French fuselage teams, we prepared a network plan for the development of the project, specifying more than 100 key process control nodes,"" said Ma Yan, president of XAT.

The company has had a long-term partnership with Airbus on its single-aisle aircraft wing equipment since 2009, and it has shown a good record of on-time and quality deliveries, Airbus said.

By 2024, the A320 fuselage equipping project is expected to meet its target production capacity. Airbus said the project indicates a step forward for the vertical integration of its supply chain in China, the largest market for Airbus.

The aircraft maker has delivered more than 540 planes of the A320 family from its final assembly line in Tianjin to Chinese airlines and some Asian carriers.

China is an integral part of the global aviation industrial ecosystem, and an important part of Airbus' global supply chain, Airbus said.

The Airbus A320 final assembly line in Tianjin, which has been in operation for more than 12 years and is the third single-aisle assembly line for Airbus after Toulouse in France and Hamburg in Germany, has helped Airbus increase its market share in China to about 53 percent and steal a march over its US rival Boeing Co.

Currently, more than 200 suppliers in China support the production of almost all types of Airbus commercial aircraft and cover all life cycles like manufacturing and maintenance of an aircraft.

""The latest movement shows Airbus' recognition of China's assembly skills and is important role in the global supply chain, as well as China's investment environment,"" said Zou Jianjun, a professor at the Civil Aviation Management Institute of China.

""China's huge domestic market shows a significant demand for commercial aircraft,"" he said.

Last year, Airbus' annual industrial spending on the commercial aircraft business in China reached about $1 billion, representing an increase of almost 60 percent compared to the level seen in 2016, the company said.

China's domestic air travel market is steadily picking up. Last month, 51 million passengers took domestic flights, which reached 93.6 percent of the level recorded at the same time of 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the Civil Aviation Administration of China."
"U.S. and the EU Suspend Airbus, Boeing Tariffs - Barnes & Thornburg","Tue, 29 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vYnRsYXcuY29tL2luc2lnaHRzL2FsZXJ0cy8yMDIxL3VzLWFuZC10aGUtZXUtc3VzcGVuZC1haXJidXMtYm9laW5nLXRhcmlmZnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Highlights The U.S. and the EU have suspended retaliatory tariffs on $11.5 billion of various products for five years, including aircraft This suspension follows a similar suspension of tariffs between the U.S. and the U.K., which was announced in March 2021 Additionally, the U.S. and EU have aligned to address “emerging threats” in this arena from China

On June 15, 2021, the United States and the European Union announced the suspension of retaliatory tariffs on $11.5 billion of various products they had initiated against one another, as a result of the longstanding dispute related to subsidies provided to Airbus and Boeing, respectively.

Prior to the suspension, the World Trade Organization (WTO) authorized the U.S. to impose tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of products annually from the EU. The EU, on the other hand, was imposing tariffs on $4 billion worth of products from the U.S. after the WTO authorized it to impose tariffs of up to $3.9 billion.

In March 2021, both sides had agreed to a four-month suspension of the tariffs. Following the U.S.-EU summit held in Brussels earlier this month, each side agreed to temporarily remove the retaliatory tariffs. The tariffs will be suspended for five years while the U.S. and EU try to settle a portion of the trade dispute pertaining to subsidies provided to Airbus and Boeing. Separately, the U.S. and United Kingdom suspended the retaliatory tariffs against each other at the beginning of 2021.

The longstanding dispute the United States has had with the EU over subsidies being given to Airbus started over 17 years ago. The U.S. alleged that Europe had been providing massive subsidies to Airbus which seriously injured the U.S. aerospace industry and its workers and were inconsistent with WTO obligations. The EU had also made similar claims about the U.S. providing massive subsidies to Boeing. Because the EU failed to comply with prior WTO rulings, the WTO ruling with regard to this dispute allowed the U.S. to apply retaliatory tariffs until the harmful EU subsidies were removed.

The U.S. tariffs were limited to 10 percent on large civil aircraft and 25 percent on more than 150 agricultural and other products imported from the EU. The tariffs applied to products primarily from France, Germany, Spain and the United Kingdom, which were the four countries responsible for the illegal subsidies. The products included Scotch whiskies, sweaters, coats, coffee, waffles, frozen meat, olives, fresh cheeses and wine. On the other hand, the WTO also authorized the EU to implement tariffs against U.S. goods, which they did and those products included whisky, jeans, and motorcycles.

The five-year suspension allows each side to provide financing in the aircraft sector as long as it is done on market terms and funding for R&D is done in a transparent manner. The agreement also establishes a working group to address aircraft subsidy trade disputes and encourage cooperation.

According to reports, the U.S. Trade Representative, Katherine Tai has said the U.S. has the option to reinstate the tariffs if the EU subsidies “cross a red line and U.S. producers are not able to compete fairly and on a level playing field.”

The agreement also addresses “emerging threats” from countries such as China, and the U.S. and the EU plan to draw up rules that will allow them to take action against countries who unfairly bolster their aircraft industry.

Women in Engineering Day: three engineers leading the way toward safer aviation - Airbus,"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIxLTA2LXdvbWVuLWluLWVuZ2luZWVyaW5nLWRheS10aHJlZS1lbmdpbmVlcnMtbGVhZGluZy10aGUtd2F5LXRvd2FyZC1zYWZlctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"We “make it fly” every day thanks to the work of an entire community of Airbus engineers. Diversity is what makes this team strong, and helps everyone find new ways to develop the techno-bricks that will contribute to safer and cleaner rotorcraft. Just like everyone else, women and girls are part of this journey toward the aviation of tomorrow.

For Women in Engineering Day 2021, Airbus strives to inspire the next generation of girls who are looking to see how they too can “make it fly.”

Elise Payenneville, Océane Martin and Anne Saby are engineers at Airbus Helicopters who are building the fleets of tomorrow thanks to improved systems, data collection and analysis processes.

While they may be among the first women at Airbus Helicopters to hold a position as engineers in their area of expertise, they certainly won’t be the last. They give women and girls interested in aviation a few pieces of advice on how they can contribute to the future of the industry.

Women from all walks of life can become engineers

Airbus’ Elise Payenneville believes there is no one single path to becoming an engineer.

According to Payenneville, the first thing every woman thinking about a career in the aviation industry needs to know is: there is no one single path to becoming an engineer.

Payenneville explains: “My own journey toward the missions I currently get to complete is unconventional. I was always passionate about the aviation industry, but I took a few twists and turns before entering the Health Usage and Monitoring Systems (HUMS) service to help improve the safety levels of our fleet.”

While she dreamed of becoming a pilot, Payenneville chose to explore other functions related to aeronautics and completed a B.A. in industrial engineering and maintenance. This first experience gave her the opportunity to discover the complexity of helicopters, during an internship with public services using rotorcraft in their daily missions.

She explains: “Every day, I could see all the pilots and engineers working on this beautiful product that is the H145, and I understood that I wanted to work with helicopters, too.”

She was enrolled as an apprentice at Airbus Helicopters to monitor the vibrations affecting helicopter elements, and added an M.A. in instrumentation to her resume. During the next two years of her apprenticeship with the company, she met her current colleagues in HUMS.

A million ways to make the future of aviation possible

Anne Saby is a Vehicle Management Systems (VMS) engineer at Airbus.

Although Payenneville always knew she wanted to work in the aviation industry, Anne Saby, a Vehicle Management Systems (VMS) engineer, says that doesn’t necessarily have to be the case.

“You don’t necessarily have to know that you want to work with helicopters in order to become an engineer in the aeronautics industry,” said Saby. “But you do need to have a love for problem-solving and to believe in the outcome of your work.”

While she was a student in engineering school, Saby’s career target was to become a network administrator. But her plans changed after she discovered a new area of expertise: signal processing. Working on radars, imaging, and wireless communications, Saby started a Ph.D. in complex systems in order to create a wireless decoder.

Contrary to what one might believe, a doctorate doesn’t always lead to research activities. Saby explains: “I knew I didn’t want to become a researcher, so I applied for positions in service-sector companies, where my skills as an engineer would really be put into practice.” As a result, Saby was recruited by Airbus Helicopters to develop the embedded software that monitored and controled the H160’s air conditioning.

Her mission was then expanded to the whole fleet. She was in charge of the programme for five years. Having kept in touch with some VMS engineers she had met while at Airbus, she finally applied for a position within the team and became a VMS engineer herself, working on the new Helionix avionics suite.

Trust yourself

Airbus engineer Océane Martin studied data analysis and then entered the Ecole Nationale de l’Aviation Civile (ENAC) as an apprentice.

The variety of missions and activities undertaken by Payenneville, Saby and Martin are proof that there are a host of different ways one can put their knowledge and skills to use to make sure that operators are able to complete their missions. One key lesson the three engineers agree on: “Don’t let anyone, including yourself, create barriers on your way toward working in aviation,” Saby says.

Martin, a data analyst working closely with Payenneville to improve the design and maintenance process of the aircraft, adds: “There are many ways to put what you learned at school into practice, so go look it up. Career fairs and your personal research will help you see all the possibilities.” Martin studied data analysis and then entered the Ecole Nationale de l’Aviation Civile (ENAC) as an apprentice. She always had dreamed of becoming an aviation engineer, but when she was taught how to analyse data, it was always shown as a service-sector activity, mostly in banking and insurance.

Don’t let anyone, including yourself, create barriers on your way toward working in aviation.

- Anne Saby, Vehicle Management Systems engineer

“It’s even more exciting to work as a data analyst at Airbus Helicopters, because we had to start from scratch and think about which type of data we wanted to collect in order to improve the design and performance of our aircraft,” she says.

When Martin was called on to present her work to the top management of Airbus Helicopters, she felt both eager and apprehensive. “I explained the importance of data analysis for the future of our division. Although I felt anxious, I knew I was prepared. And one thing I learned is: if someone asks you to present your work to the top management, it means they trust you. So, trust yourself too and make the best of the opportunity.”"
New Airbus satellites will navigate Galileo into the future - Airbus,"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA2LW5ldy1haXJidXMtc2F0ZWxsaXRlcy13aWxsLW5hdmlnYXRlLWdhbGlsZW8taW50by10aGUtZnV0dXJl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The world’s most accurate positioning system, Europe’s Galileo, is moving to the next level with design and manufacture of six Galileo second generation spacecraft at its new satellite integration centre in Friedrichshafen, Germany.

Europe’s navigation system

Galileo, the European version of GPS, came about at the beginning of the year 2000. Since 2016 Galileo has been providing world-wide services with better than specified positioning and timing accuracy, matching and even surpassing that of GPS. The Galileo programme is now reaching the full constellation deployment and is entering into the full operational capability phase. However: The world of navigation is changing, driven by rapidly emerging and changing user needs (availability and reliability), a growing number of security threats (jamming and spoofing) and the evolution of other navigation systems. If the Galileo system were to retain this status quo based on a more than 15 year old design, it would not be equipped to meet future user needs, nor cope with new security threats.

The next generation…

So it’s time for an innovative new set of Galileo spacecraft, which Airbus has started building. The new Airbus satellites will improve the accuracy of Galileo as well as the robustness and resilience of its signal, which will be key for the upcoming digital decade. They will provide new capabilities relying on highly innovative technologies such as digitally configurable antennas, inter-satellite links, new atomic clock technologies and fully electric propulsion systems. The new spacecraft will also be more flexible and reconfigurable in orbit to satisfy the expected evolution in end-user needs.

Once in orbit, they will offer increased service availability, including strengthened protection against cyber-attack enabling the addition of new user services notably in the security and safety-critical domains. Airbus’ extensive know-how in this field is a unique enabler for delivery in the challenging timeframe set out by Europe.

Weighing around 2.3 tons, each satellite is designed to operate for about 15 years. The state-of-the-art and all-electric medium-Earth orbit (MEO) platform from Airbus, reuses flight proven building blocks from our Telecoms and Earth Observation programmes, taking advantage of a unique combination of heritage and in orbit experience. The flexible and modular navigation payload solution with future growth capability is also based on telecom elements for beam forming and signal generation.

For a new era

Galileo’s second generation will enable faster signal acquisition for navigation devices such as smartphones and will provide faster access to services. This will enable many new devices to offer positioning capabilities e.g. for emerging self-driving cars and other autonomous vehicles such as drones.

In addition, Galileo second generation will offer enhanced services for search and rescue, including two-way communications to the user and a new emergency warning capability that will enable authorities to warn users in affected regions of imminent dangers such as tsunamis or earthquakes.

In short, Galileo second generation is a key milestone in European satellite navigation services that European citizens and the billions of users of Galileo services around the world will benefit from, powered by Airbus know-how."

Estimated reading time 10 minutes, 17 seconds.

A ceasefire has been declared in the 17-year transatlantic aerospace trade war over alleged government support for Airbus and Boeing. The U.S. and the European Union announced June 15 that they would suspend retaliatory tariffs on billions of dollars in non-aviation goods and ensure that future research and development funding would not favor each other’s aviation industries.

Canada and several other countries, concerned about potential fallout for their aerospace sectors, took a strong official interest in the case as it worked through World Trade Organization dispute resolution machinery.

The decision to stand down was announced by the U.S. and European leaders coming out of a meeting in the aftermath of the G7 Leaders Summit in Cornwall, England.

U.S. President Joe Biden, Council President Ursula von der Leyen of Germany, and European Union President Charles Michel of Belgium clearly had a direct hand in protecting the long-term health of companies facing increased competition from the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China.

COMAC is finalizing development of its C919, designed as a rival to the Airbus A320neo and the Boeing 737 Max, and it has partnered with Russia’s United Aircraft Corporation to develop a larger, wide-body platform — a development which has prompted Airbus chief executive officer Guillaume Faury to suggest that the current commercial aircraft “duopoly” could become a “triopoly” by 2030.

The retaliatory tariffs had been suspended in March but, as von der Leyen noted, “this meeting has started with a breakthrough on aircraft” and “really opens a new chapter in our relationship because we move from litigation to cooperation.”

Both Boeing and Airbus welcomed the truce. Airbus said in a brief statement that it would be “the basis to create a level-playing field” by sidelining “lose-lose tariffs that are only adding to the many challenges that our industry faces.”

U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai agreed. “For about 20 years, we have been at each other’s throat,” she said after talks with EU Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis, a former Latvian prime minister. “We have been too busy fighting each other.’’ Dombrovskis agreed that “we are strongest when we work with our friends and allies.”

The fight began when Boeing fired the first shots in 2004 when its chief executive officer, Harry Stonecipher, accused Airbus of abusing a 1992 agreement about government support for civil aircraft. That permitted up to a third of aircraft development to be eligible for government loans, which would be repaid with interest as well as royalties once a platform was commercially successful. However, governments’ low borrowing costs gave Airbus access to financing at below prevailing market rates.

Airbus countered that the “member state financing” or “launch aid” complied not only with the 1992 deal but also World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. It also said it had repaid more than called for in its loan agreements with the European governments, particularly France and Germany.

Airbus also said that U.S. military contracts with Boeing and support for various National Aeronautics and Space Administration research and development programs of interest to civil aviation were effectively subsidies. In addition, Boeing had received tax breaks and other support from state and local governments vying for investment in their jurisdictions.

After initial EU-U.S. attempts to resolve the escalating dispute failed in 2005, the U.S. filed a formal complaint with the WTO that the EU had illegally subsidized Airbus, prompting the EU to follow suit the next day with a complaint about U.S. support for Boeing.

As sundry reviews and decisions by the WTO rolled out, the disputed continued to simmer in subsequent years as the two original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) competed for global market share. It came to a boil when Airbus launched the A350 as a direct competitor to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

The situation became increasingly complicated when the WTO ruled in an interim report that European governments unfairly financed Airbus, only to issue a subsequent report that payments to Boeing were unfair due to indirect U.S. support through its military programs and NASA. Then the WTO appellate body partly overturned the interim report against Airbus, setting up both OEMs to claim victory in what would become the longest dispute in WTO history with companies and national governments continuing to squabble.

The dispute came back on the boil in early 2019 when the U.S. announced tariffs on $8.1 billion worth of Airbus and other EU-sourced goods such as wine — a $25-billion proposal the WTO whittled down to between $7.5 billion that fall. In February 2020, the U.S. upped the stakes by increasing tariffs on Airbus aircraft to 15 percent from 10 percent. Fearing retaliation in the key European market, asked Washington state, where it is a key employer, to suspend a preferential tax.

The tactic failed because last September, the WTO approved some $4.1 billion in retaliatory EU tariffs on a range of U.S. imports atop the previously proposed $8.1 billion, and the Europeans indicated they would act unless the U.S. backed down.

The U.S. responded with an offer to remove its countervailing action if Airbus agreed to refinance its European loans, a proposal the EU dismissed as “unacceptable” because it meant additional costs to Airbus as the global industry was struggling with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

In the dying days of President Donald Trump’s administration, which had tended to play hardball with its European allies, the WTO announced that the EU’s tariffs would still go into effect, but that pressure eased when it became evident that a Biden administration would be more conciliatory.

After the November presidential election, and before Biden could be sworn into office in January, the U.S. said at the end of December that it would widen the scope of its tariffs. That turned around in early March when both sides suspended their tariffs, setting up talks each hoped would end the dispute.

However, William Reinsch, a former U.S. trade official and now an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said that while the truce adds “an element of certainty and sanity” to transatlantic trade, the two sides have “kind of kicked the can down the road,” because issues such as whether Airbus must repay the government subsidies it has received remain unresolved for now.

Reinsch, a lawyer who also spent 15 years spearheading National Foreign Trade Council efforts in favor of open markets, also cited the evolving Chinese presence in commercial aviation. Eventually, he says, Beijing will require domestic procurement and as their aircraft mature, “they’ll start flooding the global market.”

Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Teal Group, headquartered in Aleandria, Virginia, agreed that the truce would help the U.S. and Europe to present a united front to China, which he pointed out had delayed Boeing and Airbus deliveries during the pandemic while continuing to take COMAC deliveries.

“The Chinese want to close their market and go their own way, and the biggest export market on the planet for Airbus and Boeing just goes away,” Aboulafia said. Adding that the truce won’t stop China, it “at least . . . can prevent a scenario where China divides the West and plays the U.S. and its allies off against each other.”"

Madeleine P. Published on June 3, 2021 by

For several years now, Airbus has been using additive manufacturing to produce and repair many parts for its aircraft. And by qualifying the technologies of Materialise and EOS, the European aircraft manufacturer is renewing its confidence in 3D printing. The two 3D printing companies have been qualified to manufacture certified parts using selective laser sintering (SLS) technology. The parts will be printed on the EOS P 770 3D printer and designed from PA 2241 FR, a flame retardant polyamide also manufactured by EOS. This is the first time Airbus will use the SLS process, a step forward for the company, which is once again relying on additive manufacturing to optimize its production methods.

This is not the first time Materialise and Airbus have collaborated. In 2015, the Belgian company 3D printed its first parts using the FDM printing process for the aerospace giant. Now, with the qualification of the SLS technology, Airbus and Materialise are 3D printing about 100 different parts for the A350 aircraft, and hope to deliver more models soon. Bart Van der Schueren, Technical Director of Materialise, explains: “This achievement consolidates our long-term partnership with Airbus, and it also opens up additional 3D printing applications to Airbus and its suppliers. Laser sintering is one of the most widely used 3D printing technologies and enables complex design features such as interlocking mechanisms. It’s an honor for Materialise to be Airbus’s first manufacturer for the technology.”

The characteristics of the PA 2241 FR

EOS’ newly certified material, PA 2241 FR, has a high recycle rate and, according to the manufacturer, meets the stringent quality standards required for flight certified parts. In fact, according to EOS, PA 2241 FR is suitable for parts requiring a certain degree of protection against fire, smoke and toxicity. In the aerospace industry, 3D printed parts are regularly used in aircraft cabins, for example, to make supports and ventilation ducts. Suitable applications for PA 2241 FR, as the EOS material is resistant.

Markus Glasser, Senior Vice President at EMEA-EOS, says, “We are very proud that after an extensive testing program, Airbus qualified the EOS PA 2241 FR material and processes for usage globally by the company. It underlines the high maturity and constant quality of EOS’ powder and systems and continues to emphasize the relevance of industrial 3D printing in both polymers and metals.” One thing is for sure, polymer 3D printing is becoming more widely used, and over time and in the eyes of manufacturers, more than just an alternative.

Tomorrow's airports: future energy ecosystems? - Airbus,"Mon, 21 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA2LXRvbW9ycm93cy1haXJwb3J0cy1mdXR1cmUtZW5lcmd5LWVjb3N5c3RlbXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airports are at the forefront of leading the transition towards climate-neutral operations across the entire value chain. Airbus’ “Hydrogen Hub at Airports” concept brings together key airport ecosystem players to better understand hydrogen infrastructure needs for future aircraft and to develop a stepped approach to decarbonising all airport-associated infrastructure using hydrogen.

The use of hydrogen to power future aircraft is not only expected to significantly reduce aircraft emissions in the air: it could also help decarbonise air transport activities on the ground.

And the need to do so is certainly there. In fact, airport-controlled activities account for around 2-3% of the aviation industry’s total emissions. This represents approximately 15–20 megatons of CO₂ emissions per year globally.

For this reason, airports are now beginning to rethink how their infrastructures could be designed and operated to reduce their overall environmental footprint. One promising option is to build a unique airport ecosystem with hydrogen at the core of operations.

In 2020, Airbus launched “Hydrogen Hub at Airports'' to help airports reflect on how to do just that. The concept aims to jumpstart research into infrastructure requirements for future hydrogen aircraft, as well as low-carbon airport operations, across the entire value chain. And a variety of airport authorities, airlines and energy providers are already signing on to get involved.

Airports have a key role to play to enable the transition to a climate-neutral air transport ecosystem. Hydrogen Hub at Airports enables us to collaborate with partners to define needs today, so we can pave the way for hydrogen adoption by 2035.

Lionel Cousseins, ZEROe Market Development and Airline Relations Manager

Introducing the Hydrogen Hub at Airports concept

Airports are complex infrastructure assets that rely on deep interdependencies between multiple systems, structures and stakeholders. For example, ground transport at airports includes not only passenger transport to and from aircraft via buses, but also heavy-duty vehicles – such as aircraft tugs and cargo trucks – for logistics. Traditionally, these vehicles have been powered by fossil fuels, which contribute to airports’ overall emissions. But hydrogen could drastically cut the emissions of airport ground transport. In addition, airports require vast amounts of energy for cooling and heating, the environmental footprint of which could be mitigated through hydrogen.

This concept involves collaborating with airports to develop a stepped approach to decarbonise airport facilities, ground operations and transport using hydrogen.

The on-site production (and liquefaction) of hydrogen could also be a promising option for airports to meet their individual energy needs. This solution would eliminate the need for transport to and from off-site hydrogen production facilities, which would further reduce emissions. In doing so, airports could also become future energy ecosystems with liquid hydrogen production at their core.

“Airports have a key role to play to enable the transition to a climate-neutral air transport ecosystem,” says Lionel Cousseins, Airbus ZEROe Market Development and Airline Relations Manager. “Hydrogen Hub at Airports enables us to collaborate with partners to define needs today, so we can pave the way for hydrogen adoption by 2035.”

Partnerships across the airport ecosystem

To date, Airbus has activated Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with two airline customers to assess hydrogen infrastructure needs at airports. For example, an MoU with SAS Airlines is currently investigating airport infrastructure requirements for future hybrid, electric and hydrogen aircraft. A similar collaboration agreement was also signed with easyJet. The results of both studies are expected to be released later this year.

But airline partnerships are only just the beginning.

For hydrogen to meet its full potential, the entire airport ecosystem – airport authorities, energy suppliers, regulatory authorities – needs to come together to collaborate. To this end, Airbus has signed a joint-partnership with ADP (Paris Airports) and Air Liquide to better understand hydrogen infrastructure needs at Paris Charles-de-Gaulle Airport (CDG) and Paris Orly Airport (ORY).

“At Airbus, we see ourselves as a facilitator,” Lionel explains. “This means we want to bring together all the key players around the same table to ensure we have the necessary infrastructure in place to bring our zero-emission aircraft to market by 2035.”

Airbus expects to announce additional strategic partnerships with key players across the aviation ecosystem in markets worldwide throughout 2021."
Airbus Commercial Programs update - Leeham News and Analysis,"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMS8wNi8xNS9haXJidXMtY29tbWVyY2lhbC1wcm9ncmFtcy11cGRhdGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Bjorn Fehrm

June 15, 2021, ©. Leeham News: Airbus hosted an update on the Pandemic effects on its airliner business today.

It presented its view of the pandemic’s effects overall, how it affected the different aircraft programs, and how Airbus predicts the recovery ramp to look.

Effects of the pandemic

The COVID 19 pandemic has put the airliner business in its most profound decline ever, Figure 1. 25 years of growth in the industry was washed away in two months.

The pandemic’s effects on air travel have hit international travel the hardest, with present traffic levels (ASKs) at 27% of 2019 levels and domestic ASKs at 80%, Figure 2. Overall the decline is 51%.

Airbus predicts the recovery to happen in 2023 for Domestic traffic and 2024 to 2025 for International traffic, Figure 3.

Through fast decisions to cut single-aisle production by 40% (from 60 to 40 A320 series per month), A330 to two, and A350 to five, whitetails today stand less than five. It’s despite 80% of the sales contracts being renegotiated from March 2020 to today.

Airbus last month gave its supply chain a firm forecast for the coming years so that suppliers can adapt in time for production increases.

In the presentation, the product portfolio was gone through type by type, and the production ramp and latest technical developments were discussed.

A220

The present production rate is a total of five from the Mirabel and Mobile final production lines, Figure 4, with a gradual increase to six in early 2022. The plan is to ramp the A220 series to rate 14 by mid-decade.

The A220-300 has a Maximum TakeOff Weight (MTOW) increase to 70.9t later this year, increasing the nominal range to 3,550nm.

A320

The present production rate is 40 aircraft per month, Figure 5. This increases to 45 by end 2021, rate 64 during 2023, and finally rate 70 by 1Q2024. The supply chain has been asked to give feedback on rate 75 by 2025

The attention is on the A321XLR that has started production and will enter the FAL in Hamburg end of 2021. Flight tests will be happening during 2022 and first deliveries in 2023.

A330 and A350

The production rate for the A330 remains at rate two until further, Figure 6. The A350 gradually ramps from rate five to six end next year.

The first A330-900 with the 251t Maximum TakeOff Weight (MTOW) was delivered to CORSAIR in March.

Airbus is making further improvements on the A350. The MTOW of the A350-900 has increased to 280t and for the -1000 to 319t. A weight-saving program called P7 is ongoing, and this will increase the range further. These developments will benefit the Ultra Long Haul Sunrise project that QANTAS and Airbus hope to rekindle as international travel restarts.

Sustainable Air Transport

Philippe Mhun, the EVP Programs and Services gave the status for Airbus Sustainable Air Transport programs. He pointed out that reduced fuel consumption equals reduced CO2 emissions (the relationship is one kg burned Jet fuel generates 3.2 kg CO2) and since 1990, emission per passenger-km is reduced by 50%, Figure 7.

To get down to the 2050 targets, we must do more. Airbus will have its entire fleet ready for a 50% SAF blend (Sustainable Aviation Fuel, CO2 neutral fuel made from non-fossil sources) soon, and a hydrogen-fueled airliner should be ready by 2035. To this end, Airbus yesterday announced the creation of a German Hydrogen tank center in Bremen and a French one in Nantes.

Airbus expects SAF to solve 50% of the problem with emissions, with new technologies like hydrogen caring for 42% and the remaining 8% to come from ATC route improvements and other operational enhancements.

Airbus to develop hydrogen fuel tanks for aircraft at new development centres - Aerospace Testing International,"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZXJvc3BhY2V0ZXN0aW5naW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC5jb20vbmV3cy90ZWNobm9sb2d5L2FpcmJ1cy10by1kZXZlbG9wLWh5ZHJvZ2VuLWZ1ZWwtdGFua3MtZm9yLWFpcmNyYWZ0LWF0LW5ldy1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC1jZW50cmVzLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has setup development centres at its sites in Bremen, Germany and Nantes, France to develop hydrogen fuel tanks for its future aircraft, and scheduled the first flight tests of the new fuel systems for 2025.

The Zero-Emission Development Centres (ZEDC) aim to develop Airbus’ capability to manufacture the cryogenic hydrogen fuel tanks that will be required for future hydrogen-fueled aircraft. The centres will also look at the design and integration of the tanks into aircraft.

The technology developments will cover the full product and industrial capabilities from elementary parts, assembly, systems integration and the cryogenic testing of the final liquid hydrogen tank system.

Both ZEDCs will be fully operational by 2023 to build liquid hydrogen fuel tanks with a first flight test scheduled for 2025.

The site in Bremen already develops and manufactures liquid hydrogen fuel tanks via its work in Airbus Defence and Space and ArianeGroup. The ZEDC in Bremen will initially focus on system installation as well as for the overall cryogenic testing of the tanks.

Meanwhile, engineers at the site in Nantes have experience in metallic structural technologies related to the centre wing box, including the safety-critical centre tank for commercial aircraft. The Nantes ZEDC also has the capability to manage a range of metallic, composite technologies and has experience in codesign activities on nacelle inlets, radomes and centre fuselage complex work packages.

The tank is a safety-critical component, for which specific systems engineering is needed, said Airbus. Hydrogen has to be stored as a liquid to increase its density. Liquid hydrogen has to be stored at -250°C (-418°F) to liquefy.

Airbus said, “For commercial aviation, the challenge is to develop a component which can withstand repeated thermal and pressure cycling which an aircraft application demands.

“It is expected that near-term liquid hydrogen tank structures for commercial aircraft applications will be metallic, however the potential performance opportunities associated with carbon-fibre-reinforced polymer composites are high.”

Airbus set to move ahead with A350 wide-body freighter within weeks | Arkansas Democrat Gazette - Arkansas Online,"Sun, 13 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjEvanVuLzEzL2FpcmJ1cy1zZXQtdG8tbW92ZS1haGVhZC13aXRoLWEzNTAtd2lkZS1ib2R5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is poised to begin taking orders for a freighter version of its A350 wide-body as soon as next month, in a challenge to Boeing's dominance in the market for dedicated cargo aircraft.

The European plane-maker has been speaking to more than a dozen potential customers and will seek board authorization to market the new plane in the coming weeks, provided it can line up enough commitments, according to people familiar with the matter. The program could officially open by year-end, said the people, who sought anonymity discussing confidential matters.

Going after a segment where Boeing has long held sway would mark a major strategic push for Airbus. CEO Guillaume Faury told Bloomberg News in April that he's keen to challenge his U.S. rival and that the A350, a modern, lightweight plane with carbon-fiber wings and hull, would be ""a strong candidate"" for a freighter.

The cargo version would be based on a modified A350-900 and may be slightly longer than the passenger version, according to the people. It would take several years to secure regulatory approvals and enter service.

An Airbus spokesman said that the company is always discussing new products with its customers and ""not all studies see the light of day.""

Airbus, based in Toulouse, France, has established a lead over Boeing in the market for narrow-body passenger aircraft, but has long lagged behind in bigger, more expensive twin-aisles. Boeing has built on its strength in larger planes with freighter versions of its 777, 767 and outgoing 747 models.

While most dedicated freighters are older passenger jets converted for cargo use, a handful of major carriers like UPS Inc. and FedEx Corp. buy new ones for their fleets.

Airbus has had little success with earlier attempts to shake Boeing's hold. A freighter version of the smaller A330, which entered service in 2010, has garnered just 38 sales. An attempt to set up a freighter program with the A380 super-jumbo collapsed during the same era amid a lack of demand.

The A350 would face the same hurdles as it targets the larger end of the segment, likely going up against Boeing's 777 or its successor, the 777x, should Boeing decide to move forward with a cargo version. For Airbus, the debut timetable is dependent on securing several customers.

The company is focusing its efforts on the U.S., as Airbus commercial chief Christian Scherer has met with FedEx Chairman Fred Smith to pitch the plane, the people said.

Airbus is also pursuing UPS. Both companies declined to comment.

Other potential customers include Qatar Airways, which has said it is weighing a potential order of at least 30 freighters from either Airbus or Boeing. In recent weeks, CEO Akbar Al Baker has escalated a dispute with Airbus over issues under the surface of the paint on A350s.

The outspoken executive has publicly excoriated plane-makers in the past while pressing them for concessions over aircraft. Qatar Airways declined to comment.

Other obvious targets are Deutsche Lufthansa, which has a dedicated cargo unit, and Singapore Airlines, which has 55 A350s in its fleet.

The A350, Airbus's most advanced twin-aisle, has been hurt by a collapse in demand for bigger jets caused by the coronavirus pandemic. While sales of cargo-only planes have been robust throughout the pandemic, long-distance travel is expected to take years to recover.

There's some concern that the current popularity of dedicated cargo jets will subside after air travel returns, because more capacity will be available for goods carried in the bellies of passenger jetliners. There are also hundreds of aircraft that have been retired from passenger use during the pandemic that can be converted into freighters.

Airbus is betting that the A350's fuel efficiency and cleaner emissions profile will make it an attractive choice for enough customers to make the program worthwhile. The company may also be seeking to capitalize on Boeing's production issues with the 777x, which could delay the planned freighter version and allow Airbus to debut its model first."

This flight will be made with the support of the “Plan de relance aéronautique” (the French government‘s aviation recovery plan) managed by Jean Baptiste Djebbari, French Transport Minister.

Known as VOLCAN (VOL avec Carburants Alternatifs Nouveaux), this project is the first time that in-flight emissions will be measured using 100% SAF in a single-aisle aircraft.

Airbus is responsible for characterising and analysing the impact of 100% SAF on-ground and in-flight emissions using an A320neo test aircraft powered by a CFM LEAP-1A engine. Safran will focus on compatibility studies related to the fuel system and engine adaptation for commercial and helicopter aircraft and their optimisation for various types of 100% SAF fuels. ONERA will support Airbus and Safran in analysing the compatibility of the fuel with aircraft systems and will be in charge of preparing, analysing and interpreting test results for the impact of 100% SAF on emissions and contrail formation. In addition, Dassault Aviation will contribute to the material and equipment compatibility studies and verify 100% SAF biocontamination susceptibility.

The various SAFs used for the VOLCAN project will be provided by TotalEnergies.

Moreover, this study will support efforts currently underway at Airbus and Safran to ensure the aviation sector is ready for the large-scale deployment and use of SAF as part of the wider initiative to decarbonise the industry. It will also contribute to the ultimate goal of achieving 100% SAF certification in single-aisle commercial aircraft and the new generation of business jets."

As the leading provider of military satellite communications (milsatcom) services in Europe, Airbus will be able to offer a new UHF communications service to the armed forces, particularly those of European countries and NATO allies.

As the UHF frequency band is a relatively scarce orbital resource, this offering will make up for the capacity shortage around the world. Airbus has already signed the first firm orders for this capacity, well ahead of the satellite’s scheduled launch in the first half of 2024.

The UHF payload will be operated from Airbus’s Network Operations Centre in Toulouse. Its 18 UHF channels will enable up to 200 simultaneous communications over Europe, the Middle East, Africa, large parts of Asia, as well as the Atlantic Ocean (to eastern Brazil) and the Indian Ocean (to western Australia).

Military UHF satcoms are used by the armed forces for operations on land, at sea and in the air. They have a high level of interoperability and are therefore very useful for multinational and coalition operations. The UHF band is very flexible and is of particular interest to Special Forces units as it offers a lightweight, robust and highly secure means of communication. An extensive range of terminals for use on land, at sea and in the air is available to meet the needs of the various armed forces.

Airbus has unique experience in operating UHF milsatcom services. This new payload will enhance its portfolio throughout the lifespan of the satellite. Airbus is the only armed forces private satcom operator to cover the full spectrum of military (UHF, X, Ka Mil) and commercial (L, C/Ku, Ka) frequency bands and applications.

The EUTELSAT 36D satellite will be built by Airbus based on its Eurostar Neo platform. In addition to the UHF payload, it will also be equipped with 70 Ku-band transponders for TV broadcasting.

The agreement, which suspends the threat of billions of dollars in punitive tariffs on each other’s economies for five years, is a clear sign of President Biden’s seriousness in repairing relations with the European Union and getting the wealthy bloc on his side in what he regards as a generational challenge from the rise of a technologically advanced and autocratic China.

Mr. Biden sees Europe as an ally, not an economic “foe” as former President Donald J. Trump did, and he has pledged to work with the European Union to counter China’s military, economic and technological ambitions. While Mr. Trump also saw the dangers of an unbound China, he did little to try to bring Europe along, instead punishing it with tariffs.

"United Airlines adds 270 Airbus, Boeing aircraft to order book - Skies Magazine","Tue, 29 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZXNtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvdW5pdGVkLWFpcmxpbmVzLWFkZHMtMjcwLWFpcmJ1cy1ib2VpbmctYWlyY3JhZnQtdG8tb3JkZXItYm9vay_SAVxodHRwczovL3NraWVzbWFnLmNvbS9uZXdzL3VuaXRlZC1haXJsaW5lcy1hZGRzLTI3MC1haXJidXMtYm9laW5nLWFpcmNyYWZ0LXRvLW9yZGVyLWJvb2svP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Skies Magazine | June 29, 2021 Skies Magazine |

Estimated reading time 7 minutes, 10 seconds.

As part of its “United Next” plan, United Airlines on June 29 announced the largest aircraft order in the airline’s history, and the biggest order by a single carrier in the last decade, worth some US$35 billion. The order includes a total of 270 narrow-body jets: 200 737 Max aircraft and 70 Airbus A321neos.

Driven by United’s pandemic recovery strategy as it anticipates accelerating demand for air travel, the carrier emphasized that its fleet expansion will have “a positive ripple effect” across the U.S. economy.

“Our ‘United Next’ vision will revolutionize the experience of flying United as we accelerate our business to meet a resurgence in air travel,” said United CEO Scott Kirby. “This move underscores the critical role United plays in fueling the broader U.S. economy; we expect the addition of these new aircraft will have a significant economic impact on the communities we serve in terms of job creation, traveler spending, and the shipping of goods and services.”

With the addition of the new 737 Max and Airbus A321neo aircraft, “United will replace older, smaller mainline jets and at least 200 single-class regional jets with larger aircraft.” The airline expects this will lead to “significant sustainability benefits compared to older planes: an expected 11 percent overall improvement in fuel efficiency and an expected 17-20 percent lower carbon emission per seat compared to older planes,” the carrier said.

This new order comes just days after Boeing announced the successful first flight of the 737-10, the largest aircraft in the 737 Max family — with the capacity to seat up to 230 passengers and a range of up to 3,300 miles. Of United’s order for 200 Max aircraft, 150 are slated to be the 737-10 — making United Airlines the launch customer for the 737-10 — and 50 are to be the 189-seat 737 Max 8 aircraft.

The purchase increases United’s order book for the single-aisle family to 380 airplanes, including 30 that have already been delivered, Boeing said. The agreement also includes the purchase of Boeing 737 Max training simulator data packages to support United’s pilot training programs.

United’s new order for 70 Airbus A321neo aircraft is in addition to existing orders for 50 A321XLR aircraft — “bringing the total commitment from the airline to 120 A321 aircraft.” The A321neo offers a range of up to 4,600 miles and can seat up to 244 passengers. Airbus said a “significant amount” of the new A321neos will be produced at the Airbus U.S. Manufacturing Facility in Mobile, Alabama.

Between its new Max and A321neo aircraft, United said it expects to “increase the total number of available seats per domestic departure by almost 30 percent . . . [and] lower the airline’s total carbon emissions per seat up to 15 percent.

“Specifically, the 737 MAX and A321neo aircraft offer better overall range and environmental performance with their new, more fuel-efficient engines and improved aerodynamics. Improvements come from new engines, lighter-weight carbon composite airframes and aerodynamic innovations like natural laminar flow that reduces drag,” the carrier added.

United is also confident it will create a total of roughly 25,000 unionized jobs by 2026, including flight attendants, technicians, and pilots. “The addition of these 270 new aircraft and reduction of single-class regional jets is not only good news for customers, it is excellent news for the 12,000 current United pilots, and the 10,000 more we expect to hire before the decade is out,” said United ALPA Chair, Capt Todd Insler.

United expects to fly the first 737 Max 8 this summer, and will introduce service with the Max 10 and the Airbus A321neo in early 2023.

Booming Business

Today’s announcement also comes less than one month after United made an agreement with Boom Supersonic to purchase 15 of Boom’s Overture airliners, with an option for 35 more, once the type meets United’s safety, operating, and sustainability requirements. The Overture aircraft is slated to roll out in 2025, fly in 2026, and carry passengers by 2029.

Capable of flying at speeds of Mach 1.7 – twice the speed of today’s fastest airliners – Overture can connect more than 500 destinations in nearly half the time. Boom Image

Totaling all aircraft in United’s order book, the airline expects to introduce more than 500 new, narrow-body aircraft: 40 in 2022, 138 in 2023, and up to 350 in 2024 and beyond. “That means in 2023 alone, United’s fleet will, on average, add about one new narrow-body aircraft every three days,” the carrier said.

The addition of hundreds of narrow-body aircraft to United’s fleet also means more flights and new destinations for travelers. Customers will have “even more options to fly between U.S. cities, including some new destinations, when they travel through the airline’s major U.S. hubs.”"
Helicopters tailored for special forces - Airbus,"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA2LWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLXRhaWxvcmVkLWZvci1zcGVjaWFsLWZvcmNlc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"With the H145M, the H225M and the NH90, Airbus Helicopters offers a comprehensive and complementary range of rotorcraft tailored for special operations. Already in service, the H145M and the H225M have proven their worth, while the NH90 is evolving to adapt to the specific needs of the special forces with the upcoming Standard 2.

“Nowhere without us” is the motto of the French Army’s 4th Special Forces Helicopter Regiment. This motto underlines the key role played by helicopters in special operations. Flexible, versatile, fast, and discreet, helicopters have been used for decades by special forces operators across the world to swiftly deliver and recover commandos regardless of the terrain constraints and the weather – thereby keeping an edge over the adversary.

Helicopters also are vital to the gathering of intelligence and supporting troops deployed on the ground.

As commandos are typically deployed in small numbers with limited firepower, helicopters provide the fire support so dearly needed – as well as vital logistical and medical support.

In special operations, having dedicated helicopters really gives the edge.

General Cazalaa, Deputy Chief of Staff of the French Army Aviation Branch

Flying above troops on the ground, helicopters can also be used in special operations for command and control duties. “Helicopters are a vital asset for special forces as they need to go far and get there fast,” explained General Cazalaa, Deputy Chief of Staff of the French Army Aviation Branch. “In special operations, having dedicated helicopters really gives the edge.”

The most advanced armed forces across the world have created helicopter units dedicated to special operations. In Germany, the special forces operate H145Ms. In France, the French Army has one regiment dedicated to special operations – operating the Gazelle, Puma, Cougar (recently upgraded), H225M and the Tiger.

France also has ordered a new standard of the NH90 dedicated to special forces. The French army combines the qualities and features of these helicopters to obtain maximum effect.

Meanwhile, the French Air and Space Force has one squadron of helicopters dedicated to special forces, operating the H225M. Building on its knowhow for combat search and rescue operations, this squadron has developed very unique skills for long range operations using the H225M’s air-to-air refuelling capabilities.

Other customers across the world have chosen Airbus Helicopters for their special forces. The company’s comprehensive range of platforms include equipment and features developed specifically for special operations.

The H145M: light and versatile

The 3.8-tonne H145M is a proven light and versatile helicopter perfectly adapted to conducting reconnaissance and support missions, while still being capable of delivering troops and materials at a fast pace. The H145M is the military version of the tried-and-tested, lightweight and powerful twin-engine H145 civil helicopter, which has been deployed across the world in harsh conditions – and has proven its high performance. In mountainous areas and in hot conditions, the H145 has made its name as a rugged and reliable helicopter.

Building on these qualities, the H145M has proven to be a perfect fit for special forces. Its manoeuvrability, small size and low noise signature make the H145M the ideal platform for light reconnaissance and observation missions.

The H145M's unobstructed flat floor can accommodate up to 10 troops, which can embark/disembark through both sides and the rear clamshell doors. Given these features, the H145M can be the ideal platform to infiltrate or recover small teams of commandos. The size of the H145M also is well suited for counter-terrorism missions in urban areas.

Equipped with the Airbus HForce weapons system, the H145M also can provide vital fire support. In 2013, the H145M was chosen by the German Armed Forces (Bundeswehr) as part of the Light Utility Helicopter (LUH) Special Operations Forces (SOF) project. Fifteen H145Ms were delivered between 2015 and 2017. The Bundeswehr’s H145M LUH SOF helicopters are equipped with a fast-roping system to transport special forces, a high-performance camera system for reconnaissance, as well as equipment for fire support during deployment – enabling special forces to use the helicopters in a wide variety of new fields. Furthermore, the helicopter’s ballistic protection and electronic countermeasures system offers a high level of security during deployment.

The H145M’s power, range, endurance, and payload capability provide a variety of deployment possibilities.

H225M: the combat proven assault transport helicopter

The 11-tonne H225M has earned its solid reputation with special forces. It was developed from the Super Puma following a request from the French armed forces – which wanted improved capabilities for special operations and combat search and rescue. With more than 104 helicopters in service and more than 143,000 flight hours accumulated to date, the H225M is a recognised combat-proven, versatile and reliable workhorse for military missions worldwide.

Its large cabin and heavy-lift performance enable the rotorcraft to carry up to 28 troops/personnel in cabin seats, or up to 14 troops/personnel on energy-absorbing wall-mounted seats. Two of the key features of the H225M are its extended range and the air-to-air refuelling capability. The helicopter’s outstanding 700 nm range can be extended with inflight refuelling, allowing long range missions (up to 1,300 nm/2,400 km) – making it ideal for special forces insertion missions deep into enemy territory.

The H225M can perform both day and night operations, and is much easier to operate than its predecessors – equipped with a modern and integrated cockpit avionics suite. It also is appreciated for its significant flight handling qualities thanks to the five-blade main rotor. The crew also can rely on the rotorcraft’s state-of-the-art four-axis autopilot.

The H225M enables military forces to deploy wherever and whenever needed.

The H225M is the epitome of assault helicopters. Its autopilot and self-protection system are unique in the world of special forces.

General Cazalaa

The H225M benefits from Airbus’ philosophy of permanent and continuous improvement. Since entering service with the French armed forces in 2006, the H225M has never stopped evolving and Airbus Helicopters still is working on upgrades to ensure it remains a market reference. The upgrades already introduced include new cockpit avionics, new sensors and systems (electro-optical, inertial navigation, electronic warfare) and crashworthy military cabin seating arrangements.

The French armed forces were the first to operate the H225M in 2006. The Caracal, as it is known in France, is operated both by the Army and the Air Force special forces helicopter regiment and squadron. With its blue, white and red rondel insignias, the Caracal has seen intensive action in Afghanistan and in Africa – where the rotorcraft performed in very tough conditions. It has proven to be a reliable workhorse.

The NH90: now tailored for special forces

The NH90 already is being used across the world as a special operations platform. It will now benefit from new features developed specifically for the special forces.

In October 2020, NHIndustries and its partner companies (Airbus Helicopters, Leonardo and Fokker), signed a firm contract with the NATO Helicopter Management Agency (NAHEMA) for the development of an upgraded version of the NH90 Tactical Troop Helicopter (TTH) for the French Special Forces (TFRA Standard 2). The Standard 2 will build on the features of the NH90, one of the most modern military helicopters in the world.

The new standard will include equipment and systems developed specifically for special forces, with its configuration incorporating a new-generation electro-optical system EuroFLIR™ from Safran, with displays and controls for the pilots, commandos, gunners, and loadmasters.

In addition to the enhanced cockpit, the cabin will also provide extra capabilities of fast roping with protective fire from side-mounted machine guns.

Other improvements serving the French Special Forces and the French Army Aviation include a new-generation digital 3D map, folding boarding steps and additional ceiling-mounted rope anchor points.

The NH90 Standard 2 will complement the capabilities of the French Army’s Cougar and the H225M."

The EUTELSAT QUANTUM satellite is a revolutionary step forward for commercial satellites, offering very high customisation and flexibility. It will supply services with unprecedented in-orbit reconfigurability in coverage, frequency and power, allowing complete mission rehaul, at any orbital position.



Using a software-based design, EUTELSAT QUANTUM will be the first universal satellite to repeatedly adjust to business requirements. It will be located at 48° East, and will offer extensive coverage of the MENA Region (Middle East & North Africa) and beyond allowing it to cover any area requested by the customer anytime during its life in orbit.



François Gaullier, Head of Telecom Systems at Airbus, said: “The technology we have developed and built for EUTELSAT QUANTUM is truly game changing – paving the way to fully reconfigurable geo telecommunications satellites. Our experience in pioneering this revolutionary technology demonstrates the value of partnerships – bringing together the best from Eutelsat, ESA and Airbus to achieve a new standard in flexible connectivity.”



EUTELSAT QUANTUM has been developed under an ESA Partnership Project with Airbus and Eutelsat.



Two features of this partnership, which brings industry together around large-scale programmes to achieve leaps forward in the state-of-the-art, were the development of the unique payload designed and built by Airbus in the UK under the ESA programme of Advanced Research in TElecommunications Systems (ARTES) and supported by the UK Space Agency, and the very innovative, multibeam active antenna payload ELSA+ (ELectronically Steerable Antenna+) developed by Airbus in Spain. This positions Airbus in Spain as one of the leaders in Europe for active antennas, and contributes to the next generation antennas for future programmes.



This ground breaking payload is embarked on the new geo satellite platform from Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (UK).



The satellite will provide communications on the move with dynamic beam shaping and vessel-tracking capabilities, optimised for power and throughput as required by maritime, aeronautical and land-based transportation. It will also enable bespoke design of wide-area data networks and dynamic traffic shaping, responding to demand where and when needed. In addition it will provide Government users with rapid response for public protection and disaster recovery as well as secure control using the latest encryption technology.



The mass of the satellite at launch is 3.5 tonnes and its design lifetime is 15 years.

Airbus Set to Move Ahead With A350 Freighter Within Weeks - Transport Topics,"Wed, 09 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR0bmV3cy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvYWlyYnVzLXNldC1tb3ZlLWFoZWFkLWEzNTAtZnJlaWdodGVyLXdpdGhpbi13ZWVrc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An Airbus A350. (Jasper Juinen/Bloomberg News)

[Stay on top of transportation news: Get TTNews in your inbox.]

Airbus SE is poised to begin taking orders for a freighter version of its A350 wide-body as soon as next month, in a challenge to Boeing Co.’s dominance in the market for dedicated cargo aircraft.

The European plane maker has been speaking to more than a dozen potential customers and will seek board authorization to market the new plane in the coming weeks, provided it can line up enough commitments, according to people familiar with the matter. The program could officially launch by year-end, said the people, who sought anonymity discussing confidential matters.

Cargo War

Going after a segment in which Boeing has long held sway would mark a major strategic push for Airbus. CEO Guillaume Faury told Bloomberg News in April that he’s keen to challenge his U.S. rival and that the A350, a modern, lightweight plane with carbon-fiber wings and hull, would be “a strong candidate” for a freighter.

“Leaving Boeing in an unrivaled position is a little dangerous for Airbus,” Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris said. “It’s as much about addressing spots where your competitor is strong as it is about addressing weaknesses.”

The cargo version would be based on a modified A350-900 and may be slightly longer than the passenger version, according to the sources. It would take several years to secure regulatory approvals and enter service.

An Airbus spokesman said that the company always is discussing new products with its customers and “not all studies see the light of day.”

Uphill Battle

Airbus, based in Toulouse, France, has established a lead over Boeing in the market for narrow-body passenger aircraft, but has long lagged behind in bigger, more expensive twin-aisles. Boeing has built on its strength in larger planes with freighter versions of its 777, 767 and outgoing 747 models.

While most dedicated freighters are older passenger jets converted for cargo use, some major carriers such as UPS Inc. and FedEx Corp. buy new ones for their fleets. Boeing said in its latest commercial market outlook that it sees demand for 2,430 freighters in the next 20 years, with 930 purpose-built and the remainder modified passenger aircraft.

Airbus has had little success with earlier attempts to shake Boeing’s hold on this market. A cargo version of the smaller A330, which entered service in 2010, has garnered just 38 sales. An attempt to set up a freighter program with the A380 super-jumbo collapsed during the same era amid a lack of demand.

The A350 would face the same hurdles as it targets the larger end of the segment, likely going up against Boeing’s 777 or its successor, the 777X, should Boeing decide to move forward with a cargo version. For Airbus, the launch timetable is dependent on securing several customers.

Customer Hurdle

The company is focusing its efforts on the U.S., and Airbus Commercial Chief Christian Scherer has met with FedEx Chairman Fred Smith to pitch the plane, the sources said. The plane maker also is pursuing UPS, they said. Both delivery companies declined to comment.

Potential customers also include Qatar Airways, which has said it is weighing a possible order for at least 30 freighters from either Airbus or Boeing. In recent weeks, Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker has escalated a dispute with Airbus over issues under the surface of the paint on A350s. The outspoken executive has publicly excoriated plane makers in the past while pressing them for concessions over aircraft.

Other obvious targets are Deutsche Lufthansa AG, which has a dedicated cargo unit, and Singapore Airlines Ltd., with 55 A350s in its fleet.

Qatar Airways declined to comment. Singapore Airlines and Lufthansa couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.

Collapse in Demand

The A350, Airbus’s most advanced twin-aisle, has been hurt by a collapse in demand for bigger jets caused by the coronavirus pandemic, while use of dedicated cargo jets has surged.

There’s some concern the freighter boom could subside after air travel returns, because more capacity will be available for goods carried in the bellies of passenger jetliners. There also are hundreds of airliners that have been retired during the pandemic and can be converted for cargo.

Airbus is betting that the A350’s fuel efficiency and cleaner emissions profile will make it an attractive choice for enough customers to make the program worthwhile. The company also may be seeking to capitalize on Boeing’s production issues with the 777X, which could delay the planned freighter version and allow Airbus to launch its model first.

Aviation's road to zero may look like this - Airbus,"Thu, 03 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA2LWF2aWF0aW9ucy1yb2FkLXRvLXplcm8tbWF5LWxvb2stbGlrZS10aGlz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The aviation industry has set its sights on climate neutrality starting from 2050. But to get there, a new energy ecosystem for aviation will need to be put into place via significant investment, collaboration and technology development. Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus VP of Zero-Emission Aircraft, describes the key energy pathways that are expected to make up this emerging ecosystem.

To achieve climate neutrality, the aviation industry will need to rapidly transform its existing energy mix. Indeed, although kerosene has remained the industry’s “go-to” fuel for decades, it will now need to make room for a variety of new energy pathways to power future aircraft.

Glenn Llewellyn has been watching with keen interest the development of these pathways across various industries, from automotive to heavy transport. Encouraged by the rapid progress, he is increasingly confident energy pathways like sustainable aviation fuel, hydrogen and Power-to-Liquid (PtL) synthetic e-fuel will all play an integral role in the aviation industry’s road to zero.

5 questions with Glenn Llewellyn, Vice-President of Zero-Emission Aircraft

Q. Airbus has laid bare its hydrogen ambition. Does this mean hydrogen is the answer to aviation’s carbon problem?

At Airbus, we’ve been clear from the beginning: there’s no “silver bullet” solution to decarbonising aviation. The aviation industry has set itself some ambitious targets to reduce its CO₂ emissions. But these targets don’t go far enough, particularly in the context of a growing aviation market. A mix of new energy pathways and fuels, including hydrogen, will be vital to achieving the disruptive CO₂ reductions the industry is targeting over the medium to long terms. This is why Airbus’ climate strategy involves accelerating several pathways simultaneously while fostering the development of a new energy ecosystem.



Q. Can you describe these energy pathways?

For one, there’s today’s sustainable aviation fuel, otherwise known as SAF, which is a biomass-based fuel (used cooking oil, waste, residue, etc.). All Airbus aircraft are certified to operate on up to a 50% SAF blend. In March, we launched a 100% SAF project that will help support SAF’s future certification for blends that exceed today’s maximum of 50%. In addition to biomass-based fuel, there are other alternative fuels that represent a major opportunity to reduce aviation’s CO₂ emissions, such as Power-to-Liquid (PtL) synthetic e-fuel made of renewable hydrogen and CO₂ captured from Direct Air Carbon Capture. We at Airbus see PtL as having huge potential, not only in terms of climate impact, but also in cost and scalability. And, of course, there’s hydrogen, a fuel we’re learning more about from the automotive and space industries. Hydrogen is likely to be a solution for several industries to meet their climate targets, and we believe aviation will be no exception.

Q. What are some of the challenges to scaling up this new energy ecosystem?

For SAF, there’s still a lot of work to do to encourage its uptake, which accounts for less than 1% of today’s flights. Incentives and long-term policies that encourage SAF use will be essential in this respect. Similarly, the global hydrogen economy is still in its infancy. The availability of green hydrogen – made using renewable energy – to fuel future aircraft is undoubtedly a key challenge, but we’ve been carefully observing the hydrogen ecosystem and are excited by the incredible progress. We expect all of this rapid development to help drive down the costs of hydrogen for aviation, while boosting its availability in the years to come.

Decarbonising aviation is a team sport, and we’re in it to win it.

- Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus VP of Zero-Emission Aircraft

Q. What is needed most to overcome these challenges?

Without a doubt: collaboration. This is why we’re collaborating closely with a network of partners – including engine manufacturers, airports, technology partners, and energy suppliers – to push the development of the various technologies to support their introduction and scale-up. Our main objective is to explore and make technically and economically viable as many alternative pathways as possible, while putting in place the infrastructure required to encourage their widespread adoption.



Q. Are you optimistic the aviation industry will be able to significantly reduce CO₂ emissions by 2050?

Yes, I’m optimistic. The road to climate-neutral aviation is already mapped out: we have identified the key energy pathways, as well as a realistic timeline in which to achieve our goal. We at Airbus strongly believe the time is now to invest in all possible avenues to reduce aviation’s climate impact, and we encourage like-minded industry players to support us in this endeavour. Decarbonising aviation is a team sport, and we’re in it to win it.

First rescue helicopter flies on sustainable aviation fuel - Airbus,"Mon, 07 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0wNi1maXJzdC1yZXNjdWUtaGVsaWNvcHRlci1mbGllcy1vbi1zdXN0YWluYWJsZS1hdmlhdGlvbi1mdWVs0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Munich, 07 June 2021– A rescue helicopter has flown on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for the first time, achieving a new milestone in international aviation. Operated by the German non-profit organization ADAC Luftrettung, the Airbus H145 rescue helicopter had its Arriel 2E engines ceremonially refueled with biofuel, a type of SAF, at the air rescue station at Munich's Harlaching Clinic in the presence of the ADAC Foundation's board of directors, as well as the managing directors and top management of ADAC Luftrettung, the engine manufacturer Safran Helicopter Engines, the helicopter manufacturer Airbus Helicopters, and the energy company TotalEnergies. Together, these companies will be a driving force in the decarbonisation of helicopter flight by developing alternatives to conventional aviation fuels.

The H145 was using a second-generation biofuel – the SAF of choice of the aviation industry – which reduces CO2 emissions up to 90 % compared to its fossil equivalent, because it is produced from residual and waste materials from the circular economy such as used cooking oils and fats. As a result, the fuel has no impact on agricultural food production.

The fuel used for the first rescue helicopter flight in Munich was produced by TotalEnergies at its facility in France from used cooking oil, without using any virgin plant-based oil. With this SAF, the ADAC Luftrettung fleet could achieve a 33 percent reduction in CO2 emissions, which, with more than 50,000 rescue missions and more than 3.3 million kilometers flown per year, equates to a reduction of around 6,000 tons of CO2.

ADAC Luftrettung and engine manufacturer Safran Helicopter Engines share the same ambition to contribute to the development of sustainable aviation fuel. To this effect they are launching a project with one ADAC rescue helicopter in Cologne. The project will study all aspects of biofuel usage on the H145, with an operational campaign to start as early as summer 2021.

Following the biofuel premiere, the managing directors of ADAC Luftrettung and Safran Helicopter Engines, Frédéric Bruder and Franck Saudo, signed a long-term agreement on SAF, which envisages increasing the blending ratio of biofuel to as much as 100 percent in the coming years and subsequently also promoting the use of synthetic e-fuel, also known as Power-to-Liquid (PTL), another drop-in alternative to fossil fuels. PTL refers to the generation of liquid fuels produced using electrical energy from renewable sources, which, along with the use of biofuel, will allow aviation to get closer to climate-neutral aviation.

Biofuel is currently certified and approved for aviation use in a maximum blend of 50 percent with conventional kerosene of the JET-A1 type. The ADAC rescue helicopter was flown on a 40 percent blend.

Dr. Andrea David, CEO of the non-profit ADAC Foundation, to which ADAC Luftrettung belongs, says that, ""for us, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel pilot project is a first big step on the way to a climate-neutral ADAC Foundation and air rescue service, and our contribution as a non-profit organisation to achieving the climate protection goals of Germany and Europe.""

""We want to be a pioneer in reducing CO2 in emergency medical services with environmentally friendly kerosene. This means we must also develop air rescue technologically so that the use of SAF is future-proof in the longer term. To achieve this, we have strong partners at our side,” adds Frédéric Bruder, Managing Director of ADAC Luftrettung. “Importantly, SAF is an officially approved fuel, which means that flight and patient safety remain at the highest level.”

Franck Saudo, CEO Safran Helicopter Engines, says: ""Safran is leading engine industry efforts to reduce helicopter carbon dioxide emissions. Along with this historic first flight, we signed an agreement with ADAC Luftrettung to expand the use of SAF in their Safran-powered helicopter fleet. All Safran engines are certified to operate on up to 50 percent sustainable fuel, including biofuel. Our goal is to reach 100 percent.""

Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters, says: “Pioneering sustainable aerospace is a clear ambition for Airbus and enabling the use of sustainable aviation fuel is an important milestone for our industry. Today's event is the first step in reinforcing Airbus Helicopters' ambition of having the lowest CO2 emission product range in the world.”

Christian Cabrol, Managing Director TOTAL Deutschland GmbH, adds: ""TotalEnergies has set itself the target to get to net-zero emissions together with society by 2050. By developing biofuels, we are helping our aviation industry customers reduce the carbon intensity of the energy products they use. Our sustainable aviation fuel can be used without any modification to the logistical infrastructure for storage and distribution and thus also directly in aircrafts and helicopters. We are experiencing this in practice today. Last March, we successfully started the production of sustainable aviation fuels in France, that has already been put in use for a long-haul flight between Paris and Montreal two weeks ago, and we will soon make it available to our German customers.”

Airbus Helicopters calls all industry stakeholders to join the Sustainable Aviation Fuel User Group - Airbus,"Wed, 09 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMS0wNi1haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtY2FsbHMtYWxsLWluZHVzdHJ5LXN0YWtlaG9sZGVycy10by1qb2luLXRoZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Marignane, 9 June 2021 – Airbus Helicopters is bringing the industry together to drive the deployment of biofuels, through the creation of a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) User Group dedicated to the rotary-wing community. As a pioneer in the civil turbine rotorcraft market, the company is calling all major stakeholders to join the initiative, which aims at reducing aviation’s impact on citizens and the environment.

With the SAF User Group, Airbus Helicopters plans to tackle the remaining challenges around biofuels and proactively support the industry’s CO₂ reduction commitment, thanks to constant cooperation with partners from all areas of the aviation sector. Through this inclusive approach, the SAF User Group aspires to collectively work on ways to accelerate the use of blended SAF kerosene and to pave the way toward 100% SAF flights for future fleets.

“We welcome all helicopter operators, engine manufacturers, fuel system suppliers, energy companies, fuel providers, handling companies, and all other stakeholders in the industry willing to pioneer sustainable aerospace with us,” said Stefan Thomé, Executive Vice President, Engineering and Chief Technical Officer, Airbus Helicopters.

SAF reduces CO₂ emissions thanks to the use of residual and waste material such as used vegetable oils and fats. As a result, the fuel has no negative impact on agricultural food production. Biofuels are used under the same performance and safety conditions as conventional fuels, which has made them well-established levers for CO₂ reduction in the aviation industry.

Airbus is committed to leading the decarbonisation of the aerospace sector, for our aircraft, satellites and launch vehicles, and is actively engaged in achieving sustainable air travel for future generations. The company has pledged to support an industry-wide decarbonisation movement that includes carbon-neutral growth from 2020 and a 50% reduction in CO₂ emissions. To achieve these objectives, Airbus’ decarbonisation strategy focuses on improving fuel burn in current-generation aircraft, accelerating the development of new fuels and technologies (i.e. electrification, SAF, etc.), optimising day-to-day aircraft operations, and supporting market-based measures.

All Airbus-made helicopters are currently certified to run with a blend of as much as 50% SAF in the kerosene. All industry players willing to join the SAF User Group initiative can write to contact.ahsafusergroup.ah@airbus.com by 20 June 2021.

"US, EU Agree to End Airbus-Boeing Dispute - VOA Learning English","Tue, 15 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vbGVhcm5pbmdlbmdsaXNoLnZvYW5ld3MuY29tL2EvdXMtZXUtYWdyZWUtdG8tZW5kLWFpcmJ1cy1ib2VpbmctZGlzcHV0ZS81OTMwMDAwLmh0bWzSAV1odHRwczovL2xlYXJuaW5nZW5nbGlzaC52b2FuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvdXMtZXUtYWdyZWUtdG8tZW5kLWFpcmJ1cy1ib2VpbmctZGlzcHV0ZS81OTMwMDAwLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"



The United States and the European Union have agreed to end their nearly 17-year trade dispute over government aid to Boeing and Airbus.

The deal permits the two sides to center on a common economic threat: China.

Since 2004, the U.S. and the EU have argued that government aid to the plane makers brought unfair competition. The dispute became more heated under former U.S. President Donald Trump. It led to more taxes on imports, or tariffs, from American and European products, including French wine, German cookies and American alcohol products.

In March, weeks after President Joe Biden took office, the two sides agreed to suspend tariffs on over $11 billion of goods for four months. On Tuesday, they agreed to suspend the tariffs for five years while still working on an overall agreement.

Ursula von der Leyen is the president of the European Commission. She said the deal moved the parties “from litigation to cooperation on aircraft — after 17 years of dispute.” And Biden said that it is “in the interest of the U.S.A. to have a great relationship with NATO and the EU.”

U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai added, “Instead of fighting with one of our closest allies, we are finally coming together against a common threat.” Tai, however, warned that the tariffs could start up again if American companies cannot “compete fairly” with those in Europe.

As part of the agreement, the U.S. and the EU will set up a working group to discuss issues including financing and research support for plane makers. They want to avoid support that would harm the other side. And they will fight ""non-market practices"" from China to help its aircraft industry.

Both sides said they were confident the Airbus-Boeing dispute would end within five years. And plane makers Airbus and Boeing cheered the agreement.

The agreement removes one of two major trade conflicts left over from the Trump administration. The other involves tariffs on EU steel and aluminum imports. That move angered EU leaders because Trump claimed the tariffs were for national security reasons.

The conflict hurts European producers and raises the cost of steel for American companies. And the EU retaliated by raising tariffs on products like U.S.-made Harley Davidson motorcycles and Levi’s blue jeans.

Tuesday’s agreement is welcome news for an airline industry that has been hurt by coronavirus travel restrictions.

It also brings international goodwill for Biden as he prepares to meet on Wednesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Press Release: United adds 270 Boeing and Airbus aircraft to fleet - - Runway Girl Network,"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjEvMDYvdW5pdGVkLTI3MC1ib2VpbmctYWlyYnVzLWZsZWV0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"United Airlines today announced the purchase of 270 new Boeing and Airbus aircraft – the largest combined order in the airline’s history and the biggest by an individual carrier in the last decade.

The ‘United Next’ plan will have a transformational effect on the customer experience and is expected to increase the total number of available seats per domestic departure by almost 30%, significantly lower carbon emissions per seat and create tens of thousands of quality, unionized jobs by 2026, all efforts that will have a positive, ripple effect across the broader U.S. economy.

When combined with the current order book, United expects to introduce more than 500 new, narrow-body aircraft: 40 in 2022, 138 in 2023 and as many as 350 in 2024 and beyond. That means in 2023 alone, United’s fleet will, on average, add about one new narrow-body aircraft every three days.

United’s new aircraft order – 50 737 MAX 8s, 150 737 MAX 10s and 70 A321neos – will come with a new signature interior that includes seat-back entertainment in every seat, larger overhead bins for every passenger’s carry-on bag and the industry’s fastest available in-flight WiFi, as well as a bright look-and-feel with LED lighting. The airline expects to fly the first 737 MAX 8 with the signature interior this summer and to begin flying the 737 MAX 10 and the Airbus A321neo in early 2023.

What’s more, United intends to upgrade 100% of its mainline, narrow-body fleet to these standards by 2025, an extraordinary retrofit project that, when combined with the number of new aircraft joining the fleet, means United will deliver its state-of-the-art inflight experience to tens of millions of customers at an unprecedented pace.

This order will also significantly boost United’s total number of mainline daily departures and available seats across the airline’s North American network, as well as the number of premium seats, both United FirstSM and Economy Plus®. Specifically, United expects it will have on average 53 premium seats per North American departure by 2026, an increase of about 75% over 2019, and more than any competitor in North America.

“Our United Next vision will revolutionize the experience of flying United as we accelerate our business to meet a resurgence in air travel,” said United CEO Scott Kirby. “By adding and upgrading this many aircraft so quickly with our new signature interiors, we’ll combine friendly, helpful service with the best experience in the sky, all across our premier global network. At the same time, this move underscores the critical role United plays in fueling the broader U.S. economy – we expect the addition of these new aircraft will have a significant economic impact on the communities we serve in terms of job creation, traveler spending and commerce.”

United expects to create approximately 25,000 well-paying, unionized jobs at the airline as a result of adding these new aircraft and, based on a study from the Federal Aviation Administration, the airline expects to drive more than $30 billion in traveler spending when flying United and contribute an estimated $50 billion annually towards the U.S. economy by 2026.

Plus, adding these new 737 MAX and Airbus A321neo aircraft means United will replace older, smaller mainline jets and at least 200 single-class regional jets with larger aircraft, which the airline expects will lead to significant sustainability benefits compared to older planes: an expected 11% overall improvement in fuel efficiency and an expected 17-20% lower carbon emission per seat compared to older planes.

The best customer experience in the industry

United’s new aircraft reflect a vastly improved customer experience standard – United’s signature interior – that places a premium on the overall comfort of flying – more overall available seats in the market, more premium seats on each aircraft, as well as better entertainment, overhead storage and technology features. These standards will be applied to the airline’s retrofit plan – a nose-to-tail transformation of its mainline, narrow-body fleet – that is expected to be 66% complete by 2023 and 99% complete by the summer of 2025.

United’s new narrow-body jets will help the airline increase its total seats per departure for North American flights by 30 seats, or almost 30%, by 2026. At the same time, the airline will quickly grow the number of United FirstSM and Economy Plus® seats for customers seeking an elevated experience.

United’s 737 MAX 8 has 16 United FirstSM seats and 54 Economy Plus® seats – more than double the number of extra leg room seats offered by competing airlines on similar-sized aircraft. The 737 MAX 10 – the largest member of the MAX family – makes up the majority of United’s new order and will include 20 United FirstSM seats and 64 Economy Plus® seats and the new A321neo aircraft are expected to have a United FirstSM and Economy Plus® seat count similar to that of the 737 MAX 10.

By flying bigger jets with a signature interior that includes more premium seating, United will give customers more choice when selecting their onboard experience, provide MileagePlus® members more opportunity for upgrades, and position United to better meet the demand among United’s business customers while creating even more connectivity to its global long-haul network, helping to fuel growth to all corners of the world.

“We’ll deliver a better, more consistent experience, with more features for more customers, faster than ever. While some airlines are reducing the number of economy seats with extra leg room, United will offer the most premium seats in North America, taking a different, more customer-friendly approach,” said Andrew Nocella, United’s EVP and Chief Commercial Officer. “This is United playing to our strengths – the location of our U.S. hubs means we’re uniquely positioned to focus on premium products, business travel and global flying like no other U.S. airline. Our new, signature interior creates a more consistent product across our mainline fleet – with a focus on the amenities that customers value most like seat back screens, fast WiFi and extra storage – to further set ourselves apart.”

United’s inflight entertainment – 13-inch high-definition screens in every first class seat and 10-inch HD screens in every United Economy seat on the 737 MAX – includes free access to more than 2,800 selections including movies, TV shows and international selections, as well as audio playlists, podcasts, and games. Customers also can watch documentaries and live concerts through United’s exclusive collaboration with the Coda Collection. Plus, every seat on these aircraft has access to electrical power and USB charge ports and provides a seatback experience with accessibility features for people with hearing or visual disabilities.

Each new 737 MAX and A321neo will have the industry’s fastest available in-flight WiFi that lets customers stream video from online services. The aircraft also will have Bluetooth technology throughout for easy connections between wireless headphones and the seatback entertainment screens.

United’s new, significantly larger overhead bins will provide space for one carry-on bag for every person onboard, addressing several of the biggest pain points among customers and employees. United expects that the availability of these larger bins will help alleviate gate crowding and anxiety, reduce the number of gate-checked bags and decrease the time it takes to board.

More Flights, New Destinations

United’s plan to add hundreds of signature interior narrow-body aircraft to its fleet will give customers access to more modern seats and planes while reducing flights that use smaller, single-class regional jets. These new aircraft also will give customers even more options to fly between U.S. cities, including some new destinations, when they travel through the airline’s major U.S. hubs. Finally, the larger mainline fleet will help accelerate United’s plans to expand service in partnership with local airport authorities across the United States.

Impact in Newark/NYC

United expects to resume its full schedule of flights out of Newark by November 2021 when the FAA slot waiver period ends. The airline is already the leading carrier from Newark – United’s largest global gateway – with 430 daily flights that include international destinations like Johannesburg, Tel Aviv, Mumbai and Hong Kong.

United expects the number of Newark departures on mainline aircraft to increase from 55% in 2019 to 70% by 2026. And by late 2021, United expects 100% of Newark departures to be on dual-class aircraft, including the 737 MAX and the airline’s new, dual-class 50-seat CRJ-550 jet. Today’s aircraft order means the airline can create quality, union jobs, as well as grow domestic and international capacity from Newark for years to come by replacing smaller mainline jets with larger aircraft, while at the same time driving international growth, by connecting more customers from U.S. cities to Newark/NYC for their international flights.

United is in the midst of a significant facility expansion and upgrade project at Newark. The work includes renovating an existing United Club SM location in Terminal C, building a completely new lounge in Terminal C that is capable of accommodating 500 travelers and will have panoramic views of Manhattan, as well as building a brand new United Club in Terminal A where United will operate from 12 new gates.

Jobs

Today, the airline supports about 68,000 union jobs – 89% of the airline’s total domestic workforce.

All United employees – even part-time workers – earn more than the federal minimum wage, are eligible to receive company-sponsored medical coverage, participate in company-funded retirement programs like 401(k)s and receive paid sick leave, paid vacation and flight privileges when space is available to destinations around the world. Plus, these jobs offer opportunities for career growth – about 69% of the airline’s senior leaders were internally promoted and more than 1,500 frontline employees have been promoted into management roles in the past seven years.

“The addition of these 270 new aircraft and reduction of single-class regional jets is not only good news for customers, it is excellent news for the 12,000 current United pilots, and the 10,000 more we expect to hire before the decade is out,” said United ALPA Chair Capt. Todd Insler. “This is exactly what we planned for when we reached our industry-leading pandemic recovery agreement last year and kept United pilots on the property, trained and ready to take advantage of the rapid recovery in passenger demand. With the strength of our network, fleet, and pilot compensation, we are sure United will remain the destination of choice for the most highly qualified airline pilots.”

United’s new aircraft order is expected to create about 25,000 well-paying, unionized jobs by 2026, including the following at each of the airline’s seven, major U.S. hubs:

Newark / EWR: up to 5,000 jobs

/ EWR: up to 5,000 jobs San Francisco / SFO: up to 4,000 jobs

/ SFO: up to 4,000 jobs Washington, D.C. / IAD: up to 3,000 jobs

/ IAD: up to 3,000 jobs Chicago / ORD: up to 3,000 jobs

/ ORD: up to 3,000 jobs Houston / IAH: up to 3,000 jobs

/ IAH: up to 3,000 jobs Denver / DEN: up to 3,000 jobs

/ DEN: up to 3,000 jobs Los Angeles / LAX: up to 1,400 jobs

Several United airlines leaders started out as aircraft mechanics, including the airline’s current Vice President for Technical Operations.

Overall Economic Impact

In addition to creating jobs, the addition of these new aircraft to United’s fleet is expected to drive more than $30 billion in traveler spending when flying United and contribute an estimated $50 billion annually towards the U.S. economy by 2026, based on a study from the Federal Aviation Administration and United’s internal estimates:

Jobs & Wages: In 2020, United paid more than $10 billion in wages and this new aircraft order has the potential to create an additional 25,000 United jobs by 2026, with billions of dollars more in potential additional wages expected. United estimates that every new direct airline job results in about two additional indirect jobs like aircraft manufacturers, airport management and airport retail. Furthermore, United’s estimates indicate that each new direct and indirect job induces an additional five jobs , potentially creating a total wage impact of up to $12 billion annually.

Furthermore, United’s estimates indicate that each new direct and indirect job induces an additional five jobs , potentially creating a total wage impact of up to annually. Visitor Spending: Based on the FAA study, United estimates domestic air travelers spend about $500 per trip in addition to airfare (food, lodging, recreation, gifts, entertainment, etc.). The addition of 270 new aircraft means the potential to carry tens of millions more passengers per year through 2026, which, using this metric for visitor spending, could contribute more than $30 billion in annual consumer spending when traveling on United.

Taxes & Fees: Each year, United generates about $4 billion of direct (ticket excise, fuel, and property) and payroll taxes. United’s own internal analysis estimates that these numbers will increase as a result of purchasing these 270 new aircraft.

Sustainability

By 2026, United expects its use of aircraft in this new order alone will lower the airline’s total carbon emissions per seat up to 15%. Specifically, the 737 MAX and A321neo aircraft offer better overall range and environmental performance with their new, more fuel-efficient engines and improved aerodynamics. Improvements come from new engines, lighter-weight carbon composite airframes and aerodynamic innovations like natural laminar flow that reduces drag. United has set an ambitious goal to be 100% green by reducing its greenhouse gas emissions 100% by 2050, without relying on traditional carbon offsets.

EcoPulse™ demonstrator completes wind tunnel testing - Airbus,"Wed, 09 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDIxLTA2LWVjb3B1bHNldG0tZGVtb25zdHJhdG9yLWNvbXBsZXRlcy13aW5kLXR1bm5lbC10ZXN0aW5n0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The EcoPulse distributed propulsion hybrid aircraft demonstrator – which is being developed by Daher, Safran and Airbus with the support of France’s Civil Aviation Research Council (CORAC) and French Civil Aviation Authority (DGAC) – has successfully completed wind tunnel testing at the Airbus UK Filton facility.

EcoPulse - Wind tunnel testing show more show less The EcoPulse distributed propulsion hybrid aircraft demonstrator – which is being developed by Daher, Safran and Airbus with the support of France’s Civil Aviation Research Council (CORAC) and French Civil Aviation Authority (DGAC) – has successfully completed wind tunnel testing at the Airbus UK Filton facility.



The EcoPulse demonstrator is an integral part of our decarbonisation roadmap, increasing our knowledge of distributed propulsion systems, paving the way for electric and hybrid-electric, emission-free aircraft. These wind tunnel tests will enable us to align our simulation models with actual performance in order to validate future configuration choices and technologies. This is yet another milestone successfully achieved with our partners Daher and Safran, once again highlighting that the path to zero emissions will benefit from collaborative expertise.

Jean-Brice Dumont, Executive Vice President Engineering, Airbus



Wind tunnel tests, key to validating flight test performance

During the development phase of new aircraft configurations, engineering teams need to verify that in-flight structure and systems behaviour and performance matches that of computer simulations. By placing individual components, small-scale models or whole full-sized parts in a wind tunnel, previously calculated assumptions can be validated.

“The EcoPulse wind tunnel tests allowed us to evaluate the performance characteristics of the propeller and the cooling process of the electric engine. To achieve this, we assembled the engine -provided by Safran-, the Airbus nacelle and the propeller -provided by DUC Hélices- that will be installed on the actual demonstrator aircraft, in the wind tunnel. We then used large powerful fans to blow air (at differing speeds) over and around the model. By doing this we were able to take actual measurements and capture real-time data” explains Tim Axford, Head of Airbus Wind Tunnel facility, Airbus UK.

Testing the propeller performance: “We looked at the different levels of power and Revolutions Per Minute (RPM) for the engine, measuring the thrust and the force on the propellers. We also looked at the propeller ‘wake’ or airflow behind the engine. This gave us a set of experimental data to better understand the interaction between the propeller and the wing” says Tim.

Electrical engine cooling concept: “Electrical engines generate heat while running requiring a cooling system to lower temperatures, both on the ground and in flight. In the wind tunnel, dedicated engine and air temperature measurements were recorded to assess the effectiveness of the cooling technologies.”

Next steps

The observations and data collected during the wind tunnel tests will allow Airbus and its partners to better estimate the power consumption of the propulsion system, and consequently the final energy performance of the aircraft demonstrator. “The precise figures of the propeller performance will be taken into account for the creation of the Airbus Flight Control Computer software, one of the next steps” says Matthieu Scherrer, Airbus EcoPulse project leader.

In the coming months, Airbus, Daher and Safran will work towards the achievement of the Critical Design Review (CDR), which will give way to the start of the production of the EcoPulse demonstrator, ahead of ground testing early 2022.

Launched in June, 2019, the EcoPulse demonstrator is scheduled to make its first flight test flight by summer 2022.



About Distributed Propulsion Systems

Distributed Propulsion Systems consist of breaking down thrust generation into many small engines spread out along the span of the wing. Tailoring the power distribution configuration in this way could benefit cruise, as well as take-off and landing performance but also noise emissions. And last but not least, the use of distributed engine thrust could enable aircraft flight control concepts to be redefined."
