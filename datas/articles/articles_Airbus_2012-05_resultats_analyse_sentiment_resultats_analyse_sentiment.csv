Odds and Ends: More from the Airbus Innovation Days - Leeham News and Analysis,"Tue, 29 May 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxMi8wNS8yOS9vZGRzLWFuZC1lbmRzLW1vcmUtZnJvbS10aGUtYWlyYnVzLWlubm92YXRpb24tZGF5cy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"We have some follow-up to our trip last week to the Airbus Innovation Days:

A350 Program: Aviation Week has this article about the A350 program, noting that the A350-800 seems to be suffering from from benign neglect.

A350 Engineers: There is a lot of buzz “out there” that the A350-900 program is sucking up engineers from the A350-1000. We asked Airbus about this at the Innovation Days. There is no question that the -900 timeline is challenging (see chart) but Didier Evard, EVP of the program, says engineers will be released soon for the 1000.

“This year we have to ramp up the 1000 team,” Evard said. “We have internal plan and to increase the workforce from the outside to start the detail design this year.”

We asked what was the level of engineers assigned to the 900, using the example that if 100% were the norm, was the program at 100% or 125%, for example. Evard didn’t directly address that but said:

“The 900 this year will go down from 100% to around 60% or 70% and be stable.”

A380 Wing Rib Fix: Airbus showed this illustration:

Although the slide shows 60 ribs per wing, in practice, Airbus says only 20 have needed repair.

A320neo affecting A320ceo demand: JP Morgan issued this observation following the Innovation Days:

A320neo EIS is affecting demand for the current version. The imminent introduction of the a more efficient version of the A320, the neo is scheduled to enter service in 4Q2015, should make it more difficult to drum up demand for current generation A320s in 2014/2015. The years immediately preceding the changeover have always seemed like a potential rough patch, both for the A320 and the 737, which will transition from the NG to the MAX, in 2017. According to Ascend, A320 slots are filled for 2014 with 484 aircraft scheduled for delivery, 42/month implies ~480 deliveries, but 2015 is not yet full at 362 A320s. As some customers could walk away ahead of the neo introduction or for other reasons and new orders should be hard to come by, holding the rate at 42/month looks reasonable. Lease rates on current generation A320 family aircraft have been the weakest among major Airbus and Boeing platforms, an indication that the market is not as hungry for more of them as it is for other models.

We heard long ago that Airbus was worried about demand for the ceo, but we also heard the same is quite true for Boeing on the 737NG with respect to MAX sales. This is why we are seeing many Airbus and Boeing deals include the current generation of airplanes with the re-engined models. It’s also why, we believe, we’re seeing pricing on the current generation of airplanes dropping precipitously, which will of course affect residual values and lease rates.

Boeing 'on right trajectory' to catch Airbus in short-haul market - The Guardian,"Mon, 28 May 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDEyL21heS8yOC9ib2VpbmctY2F0Y2gtYWlyYnVzLTczNy1tYXjSAUxodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAxMi9tYXkvMjgvYm9laW5nLWNhdGNoLWFpcmJ1cy03MzctbWF4?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing has stepped up the pressure on Airbus in the battle for control of the short-haul aircraft market after claiming that it is on track to draw neck-and-neck with its arch-rival.

Airbus has stolen a march on its competitor with the launch of the A320neo, an upgrade of the plane that is used by scores of airlines including easyJet. It has received 1,289 firm orders so far but Boeing has hit back with the 737 Max, which follows the strategy of the neo in revamping a tried-and-trusted model.

Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing at Boeing's commercial unit, said the company is focusing on achieving ""parity"" on orders with the fuel-efficient neo, having received 451 firm orders, from carriers including Dallas-based Southwest, the airline credited with inventing low-cost flying.

""We are on the right trajectory to catch them,"" said Tinseth. ""And that's where we want to be.""

Despite the ongoing Airbus duel, Boeing expects a major emerging market manufacturer to break the two-handed stranglehold on the large passenger aircraft market. The Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China [Comac] is the front-runner to launch a rival to the 737 and A320, with Ryanair agreeing a deal to assist the Chinese company in designing a 200-seater competitor. ""We think the duopoly between Airbus and Boeing will be over,"" said Tinseth. ""But the question is, will they be successful? We think those guys will be later rather than sooner but the market will tell. We have to make our plans assuming that they will be successful.""

A spokesperson for Ryanair, which operates 737 aircraft, said the airline was discussing a new order with Boeing but was not in serious talks with any manufacturer and could still plump for Comac. ""We believe it will be a realistic alternative should we want to make a large order in a number of years' time.""

Russia's challenge as an emerging contender was dealt a blow this month when a Sukhoi Superjet crashed on a promotional flight in Indonesia, killing all 45 people on board. The new 90-seater plane, aimed at regional airlines such as the UK's Flybe, had been launched as a challenger to products sold by Canada's Bombardier and Brazil's Embraer.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.528842568397522}",negative,0.528842568397522,-1
Will New Airbus Seats Help Airlines Charge More for Wider Seats? - CNBC,"Fri, 25 May 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiIGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2lkLzQ3NTY0ODg30gEkaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wL2lkLzQ3NTY0ODg3?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"""These seats are not meant just for overweight passengers,"" Airbus' aircraft interiors director Zuzana Hrnkova told journalists, before adding, ""Mothers with children may be ready to pay a little more in order to be able to keep their babies in their lap, and large football players may be interested.""

The silver lining, of course, is that the airlines could make as much as $3 million in extra profits over a 15-year period by charging extra for the extra wide seats, the AFP says.

So far, only two as-yet-unidentified American airlines have expressed interest in the extra-wide seats, and there is likely good reason for that.

In recent years, there have been several incidents of American passengers being ""too fat to fly"" on American carriers. Director Kevin Smith was famously booted from a Southwest flight in 2010 because he was too wide for his seat.

Last summer, Kenlie Tiggeman made headlines for calling out Southwest for claiming she was too fat to get on a flight. She decided to sue the airline this month for not having a cohesive policy on the matter. Yet airlines like AirTran and Southwest have created policies to require an overweight passenger to purchase an extra seat if they cannot fit in their assigned seat.

Is this an example of the airlines trying to do right by passengers and dissipate the issues? Or is this a case of the airlines milking the flying public for all they're worth? After all, the the airlines are seemingly comfortable charging for carry-ons and even adjacent seats.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995720982551575}",neutral,0.9995720982551575,0
Airbus admits no quick-fix for A380 wing-rib crack issue - Flightglobal,"Thu, 24 May 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWFkbWl0cy1uby1xdWljay1maXgtZm9yLWEzODAtd2luZy1yaWItY3JhY2staXNzdWUvMTA1NDgyLmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is expecting up to 120 A380s to be delivered before the permanent fix for the wing-rib bracket cracking problem on the type is fully in place.

The airframer detailed its proposed solution during a briefing in Toulouse. Its initial retrofit, for aircraft already in service, centres on 23 hybrid ribs mounted in the more lightly-loaded sections of each wing.

Retrofit involves replacing the type-7449 aluminium with a more robust grade, type 7010. This retrofit also involves localised reinforcement and fitting thicker rib brackets. Two ribs in each wing-tip will also be replaced.

But the forward-fit solution will replace these ribs with all-aluminium components, also built from type-7010 material, from the outset. The region around the inspection manholes will be reinforced and the rib feet will be reshaped to make them more forgiving.

Parts will be available to perform the modification on in-service aircraft from the first quarter of 2013 while wing assembly from the end of this year will implement the rib design change. All ribs will be built from type-7010 aluminium, in a similar way to other Airbus programmes. A380s delivered from 2014 onwards will have the new rib design.

Airbus executive vice-president for programmes Tom Williams says the type 7449 aluminium was strong and lightweight but brought a ""degree of brittleness"". Eliminating this material and switching to the 7010 grade gives greater strength but also around 90kg additional weight.

The flight-test programme for certification has not yet been detailed but Williams says the airframer hopes to fly the demonstrator in the autumn. He stresses that the fix will restore the full life capability of the wing without impacting performance.

Williams estimates that 110-120 aircraft will have to be retrofitted. He says the cause of the cracking is ""well established"", the result of material choice plus thermal distortion at extremely low temperatures, and stresses generated during assembly.

""When we were designing the wing, we pushed hard for weight reduction,"" Williams says, adding that the original hybrid design saved 300kg.

But he admits that the airframer, during ground testing of the airframe, made ""assumptions"" on the use of the type-7449 material because it had been used on other programmes.

He adds that the linear, finite-element modelling used to model some ribs on the aircraft assumed that adjacent ribs would behave the same way. Some non-linear modelling tools, which might have helped the analysis, were not available at the time.

Williams also points out that fatigue testing cannot take into account every variation of temperature and pressure to which the aircraft will be subjected in service.

Intensive testing is under way, he says: ""We only want to do this one time. It's very disruptive to customers. If we have to ground [a customer's aircraft] we only want to do it on time.

""It's not a complicated fix by any means, [but] it's about making 110% sure we have the right answer.""

But the airframer is ""still working its way"" through the approach to implementing the fix on in-service aircraft. Williams says a ""nose-to-tail"" grounding is one option, enabling completion in one session, but some customers might opt to split the fix across C-checks.

Airbus announces plans to add 2 inches to aeroplane seats - Daily Mail,"Sat, 26 May 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtMjE1MDM4My9BaXJidXMtYW5ub3VuY2VzLXBsYW5zLWFkZC0yLWluY2hlcy1hZXJvcGxhbmUtc2VhdHMuaHRtbNIBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtMjE1MDM4My9hbXAvQWlyYnVzLWFubm91bmNlcy1wbGFucy1hZGQtMi1pbmNoZXMtYWVyb3BsYW5lLXNlYXRzLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Too fat to fly? Not anymore… Airbus announces plans to add two inches to aeroplane seats

Airline seats are literally growing with demand.

Airbus has announced that it will be providing extra-wide seats for overweight passengers as number of fat Americans creeps up.

One third of the population are currently obese, with the figure expected to reach 42 per cent by 2030.

A tight squeeze: Overweight passengers can cause misery for others (stock image)

Two 20-inch seats will be installed on each side of the aisle, sacrificing the space for three regular 18-inch seats on board the A320 - on Boeing aircraft standard seats are 17 inches.

Extra-large passengers will be able to purchase extra-large seats at an added cost, which will likely prove lucrative to the air travel industry.

Airlines could make as much as $3 million extra in profits over a 15-year period, according to the Huffington Post .



It is the latest money maker after it was announced some airlines would be charging for carry-on luggage or for adjacent seats.

But so far only two American airlines have shown interest in the extra-wide seating.

It seems that others are treading carefully in the wake of recent fury about overweight passengers being kicked off planes.

Latest model: The A320 will have 20-inch seats on either side of the aisle

One woman, Kenlie Tiggeman, this month filed a lawsuit against Southwest after she was told she was too fat to fly and would have to buy another seat.

She is not seeking monetary damages from the airline, Ms Tiggeman has claimed that she wants to enact an industry wide standard for rules to be put in place clearly stating the official policy of all U.S air companies.

'We need to know what the rules are,' she said.

'We need to know if we need one seat or two, because this eyeballing happening at the gate is incredibly discriminatory, and it's so unnecessary.'

In February 2010, director Kevin Smith famously was told he was ‘too wide for the sky.’

According to his Twitter feed, he was removed from the Southwest flight because he was deemed a safety risk.

The Jay and Silent Bob director was given a $100 voucher by the airline and boarded another flight. Southwest later reached out to apologise.

The airline also booted a thin flier from one of their seats in July of 2010 on a Las Vegas-to-Sacramento flight so an obese 14-year-old could have her seat.



'It didn’t seem right that I should have to leave to accommodate someone who had only paid for one seat,’ she told the Sacramento Bee at the time.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9958809614181519}",neutral,0.9958809614181519,0
"The moving numbers, redux, in the A320-737 game - Leeham News and Analysis","Tue, 29 May 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxMi8wNS8yOS90aGUtbW92aW5nLW51bWJlcnMtcmVkdXgtaW4tdGhlLWEzMjAtNzM3LWdhbWUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For two years, Boeing claimed the 737NG was 8% more economical (and here) than the Airbus A320. Boeing told media, analysts, everybody who would listen. Boeing illustrated the point before and after the MAX.

Here is a recent illustration; note the NG advantage over A320ceo is reduced to 6%:

And Randy Tinseth, in Randy’s Journal, writes:

Combining the seat count issue with all our latest improvements gets you to a 6 to 7 percent difference. So, if the aircraft are not at parity today, what does that say about the rest of the story? It’s always fun to have spirited debate with our competitors. But in this case, the numbers really do speak for themselves. I’d love to hear your thoughts.

Our thought was, What happened to 8%? Is this a change in the Boeing messaging? So we asked Tinseth, and through a spokeswoman, the response was, “The 8 percent is our current operating cost per seat advantage over our competition and the other is a measure of fuel burn per seat.”

Airbus, as we’ve noted before, disputes Boeing’s analysis and offers up its own, where numbers are again at the forefront. A key assumption on Airbus’ part is using 157 seats for the 737-800 vs the 162 used by Boeing. Tinseth recently has this to say about that: according to Seatguru.com, Tinseth argues Boeing is closer to right than Airbus–hence his comment above.

Airbus also disputes the 20%-25% maintenance advantage Boeing claims for the 738. Boeing explained here where that comes from.

Here is an Airbus slide from the Innovation Days. Note the seat assumptions in the fine print.

The bouncing around is enough to make one airsick. This is why we remain skeptical of data from both OEMs and prefer to listen to the airlines, who tell use the two airplanes are very close.

Update, 3:30pm PDT: A reader linked this Airbus slide, which was previously posted but forgot about. It addresses Tinseth’s seat issue in the print at the bottom, and was created last year by Airbus.

Airbus Military studies gunship versions of medium transports - Flightglobal,"Thu, 10 May 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLW1pbGl0YXJ5LXN0dWRpZXMtZ3Vuc2hpcC12ZXJzaW9ucy1vZi1tZWRpdW0tdHJhbnNwb3J0cy8xMDUyMTQuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Military is studying possible new variants of its CN-235 and C-295 medium transports adapted for tasks including combat support and battlefield surveillance, along with performance enhancements for the latter type.

Revealing the company's investigation of a gunship development, head of market development for light and medium transport aircraft Jerónimo Amador says: ""We have seen a growing interest from customers."" This has been prompted by a need to perform counter-piracy operations, participate in low-intensity conflict and provide protection for critical national infrastructure, he adds.

Amador confirms that Airbus Military has held talks with ATK over the US company's work to modify two ex-Spanish air force CN-235s as gunships for Jordan, and that it is ""looking for a partner to allow us to offer an efficient solution"".

Both images © Airbus Military Gunship versions of the CN-235 (top) and C-295 could be offered

Aircraft could be manufactured in a dedicated armed reconnaissance and combat support configuration, to include an electro-optical/infrared sensor, fuselage-housed 30mm (1.2in) cannon and potentially laser-guided rockets and missiles. A surveillance radar could also be carried, along with intelligence-gathering equipment and up to four onboard operator stations. Alternatively, customers could be offered elements of this system as a removable kit.

Potential customers exist in Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, Amador says.

Other applications now being considered for the C-295 include a model equipped with a ground surveillance radar and up to eight onboard operator workstations, a signals intelligence-gathering development and a VVIP transport. Airbus Military is also eyeing a palletised kit, which would enable the aircraft to serve as an inflight refuelling platform for combat helicopters.

Meanwhile, Amador says near-term enhancements to the aircraft could include aerodynamic improvements - winglets were considered as part of a proposed airborne early warning and control system version being offered with Elta Systems - and using more power from its Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127G engines. The latter move could boost the type's rate of climb and cruise speed and offer increased mission flexibility, he says.

EBACE: Airbus Corporate Jets steps up its presence at air shows - Flightglobal,"Sun, 13 May 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vZWJhY2UtYWlyYnVzLWNvcnBvcmF0ZS1qZXRzLXN0ZXBzLXVwLWl0cy1wcmVzZW5jZS1hdC1haXItc2hvd3MvMTA1MjY1LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Corporate Jets is stepping up its presence on the air show calendar as it aims to put its narrowbody aircraft in front of as many potential buyers as possible.

The newly-independent Airbus unit will be exhibiting at 11 events this year, up from the regular four to six, says Francois Chazelle, vice president commercial. ""We've come to realise that the best way to sell the aircraft is to show the cabin - the widest and tallest on the market - to as wide an audience as we can,"" he says.

ACJ is at EBACE with an ACJ319, chartered from one of its biggest customers, Comlux. The jet arrived in April from Comlux's own Comlux America completions centre in Indianapolis, having been delivered green last year.

The ACJ319 is certificated to carry 19 passengers and features two private rooms that convert to bedrooms, one with an en-suite bathroom.

In a separate move, the ACJ318 and ACJ319 have been awarded eligibility for FAA Part 135 operations. This means operators can avoid the more stringent Part 121 process, designed for airlines. The development should make it easier for owners in countries such as China and Saudi Arabia, which follow US regulations, to charter their aircraft to paying passengers.

Airbus has secured 60 orders for VIP versions of its widebody airliners since the mid-1980s, and 110 narrowbodies since launching the Airbus Corporate Jet family in 1997.

Airbus is taking orders for sharklet-equipped ACJs. The enhanced winglets are offered as a fuel-saving, range-boosting option. Airbus has not yet received any orders, but one customer has ""provisions"" to add them, says Airbus Corporate Jets.

What makes the location unique can be seen on the southern side of its single runway, where several massive new hangars dominate the skyline. The ramp outside is dotted with a variety of military transport aircraft, ranging in size from Airbus Military's diminutive C-212, flown around the globe for almost 40 years, up to the A400M ""Grizzly"", which is less than 12 months away from entering use.

© Airbus Military First flown in Seville in 2010, A400M development aircraft ""Grizzly 2"" shone in recent high-altitude tests in Bolivia

The reason for choosing Spain's fourth-largest city to house the final assembly line (FAL) for Europe's new-generation military airlifter stems from the nation's rich heritage in this sector, which was built by the then-CASA company. It also reflects a strong desire by parent company EADS to establish a new airlift centre of excellence in Seville, with support and financial backing also coming from the Andalucian authorities.

Major investment in the San Pablo site has included the construction of assembly lines for both the A400M and Airbus Military's light and medium transports, plus flight-test facilities, a paint shop and a major international training centre.

PRODUCTION FOCUS

The signature in May 2003 of a development and production contract for an original 180 aircraft was the catalyst for creating the facility for completing the A400M. Major structures arrive aboard Airbus A300-600ST Beluga transports, with five development examples having been flown and the first two production aircraft now on the line.

Production should hit its planned maximum rate of 30 per year during 2015, with deliveries to be made to launch nations Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain, Turkey and the UK, plus export buyer Malaysia.

While the new aircraft is the largest to have been assembled in Seville, the expertise required to run the line draws in no small part from Airbus Military's success with the C-212, CN-235 and C-295. These are completed in a spacious hangar just behind that built for the larger type, and where the effects of a new transformation programme are beginning to have a major impact.

November 2013 will bring the 30th anniversary of the CN-235's first flight, while its stretched-fuselage and re-engined C-295 stablemate made its debut sortie in 1998. A combined 375 of the twin-turboprops have now been sold, including 100 of the newer design, accounting for more than one-third of Airbus Military's total of 1,060-plus transports.

The company's production rate for the light and medium types averaged 18 per year between 2007 and 2011, a period during which it also expanded the number of special mission variants on offer. These now include maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare aircraft, plus an airborne early warning and control system version being offered to a prospective launch customer with Israeli partner Elta Systems.

© Airbus Military The C-295 is now offered as an airborne early-warning asset

With multiple versions of the CN-235 and C-295 typically to be found in the facility's four work stations and with parts arriving from locations including Chile, Indonesia, Poland, Portugal and Turkey, Airbus Military faced a serious challenge in managing its production flow, says Ricardo Rojas, head of the FAL for light and medium products.

""Every station is organised like a small factory, with logistics and control,"" Rojas says. ""We have to manage the workload, with a tack-time of 10 days to move to the next position."" Each station on the pulse line has between 40 to 50 people working on it, depending on the version of aircraft being completed. ""It's very difficult to manage that,"" he says. ""You need to have flexibility in your people.""

Two shifts of about 300 people each work on the light and medium FAL, with its total staffing level being around 700.

The company has recently established a basic reference group (GBR) model, under which all C-295s will be manufactured with certain equipment and wiring installed. This will enable any aircraft to be adapted for tasks beyond the air transport mission from a wide range of options. As a result, Rojas says the time needed to accommodate such requests can be cut by up to 30% for some versions, with the step also reducing costs. A further 10% saving could follow, along with reduced non-recurring costs for new versions.

SALES TARGET

The first aircraft to have been completed using the new model was delivered to Ghana last month, the 87th C-295 produced. While it will split production equally between the type and the CN-235 this year, largely because of a follow-on French order for the smaller model, under current plans only three CN-235s are likely to be completed in 2013.

With the production model transformed, Airbus Military is stepping up its efforts to boost the current build rate. ""At 18 a year we are in a comfort zone, but we aim to increase deliveries up to 25,"" says Jerónimo Amador, head of market development for light and medium transport aircraft. ""The production line is ready for that.""

The target is to deliver 20 per year for the next three years, with sales opportunities including an Indian air force deal to replace 56 Hawker Siddeley 748 transports. The company is also looking to broaden the variety of special mission variants of the C-295 that it can offer to its existing and new customers. In all, Amador says Airbus Military aims to sell about 215 aircraft between 2012 and 2021.

Beyond the new efficiency being enjoyed by customers of the medium transport, the GBR transformation has already had an impact on the A400M. An initial 15 personnel from the light and medium FAL were transferred in January to work on the new project, another 25 will follow during November.

Work on the A400M line is now focused on completing assembly of the first of at least 172 production aircraft. To be delivered to the French air force around the end of this year, MSN7 is in the Station 35 position undergoing system tests before having its Europrop International TP400-D6 engines installed. First flight will occur ""during the summer"", Airbus Military says.

All parts for aircraft MSN8, France's second of 50 A400Ms, are already in the hangar, with assembly work due to commence soon. The next aircraft, to be put together from early next year, will be delivered to the Turkish air force.

© Airbus Military An efficiency drive will cut 30% off the time needed to assemble some CN-235/C-295s

Airbus Military's workforce in Seville has been sourced from within the region. ""The employees are local people,"" Rojas says. ""We are always measuring their skills and launching training to get the level that we want."" A new assessment process for all members of staff this year will define the skills required to perform each type of job.

New assembly-line staff receive instruction in Andalucia, where an aeronautical engineering degree course is now available in Seville, before arriving as specialists in areas such as electrics or mechanics. On-the-job training will enable them to broaden their expertise, which Rojas says is vital for the long-term: ""In the future we want people who are capable of doing everything.""

The company is studying whether to also introduce the GBR concept with the CN-235, but a decision will be driven by its future orders intake.

One possibility is that further development could be performed in partnership with PT Dirgantara Indonesia, using a model already being introduced with the C-212. All parts for the -400 version are already made in Indonesia, and Airbus Military is preparing to assemble its last-ever example in Spain. Components are due to arrive in San Pablo during June, with the transport to be delivered to Vietnam in December. All subsequent examples will be completed in Indonesia.

""We are now analysing the potential for an aircraft in the C-212 category,"" Amador says, identifying the need to support commercial operators flying on ""pioneer routes"" to remote parts of Indonesia. ""We believe the C-212 is still a good product for this utility market.""

A long-term partner to Airbus Military and CASA before it, Jakarta also signed a February order for nine C-295s, the last two of which should be assembled in the customer nation.

Although it was first flown 14 years ago, Amador says the C-295's sales performance to date, and its growing range of special mission applications, mean Airbus Military is in no hurry to launch work on a ""C-2XX"" successor, but it continually assesses the market need.

""Our view is that the C-295 with continued development is a solid product for the next 15 to 20 years,"" he says. ""We don't see now a significant need for a new development.""

INTERNATIONAL TRAINING CENTRE WELCOMES ALL-COMERS

As production aircraft MSN7 takes shape on the A400M final assembly line, Airbus Military is also working to ready the training system which will prepare the first pilots and loadmasters to operate Europe's new-generation airlifter.

With the first aircraft due to be delivered to the French air force around the end of this year, the company is making preparations to begin training the service's first four pilots, up to six loadmasters and maintainers using the international training centre (ITC) at its San Pablo site near Seville.

Opened in October 2010 and already supporting customers for Airbus Military's light and medium transports, the 12,000m2 (130,000ft2) facility has 22 training rooms and will eventually house six full-flight simulators, including at least one for the A400M.

""We plan to complete training on the first two French air force crews before the end of this year,"" says Ian Burrett, Airbus Military's head of training and aircrew operations. ""We have got a lot to do in the next seven months, but are very much on track to do that.""

The first equipment needed to deliver the course is nearing readiness, with a computer-based training system now going through validation testing.

Procedural and maintenance trainers will follow, with a Thales-built full-flight simulator to be in use around August but only able to support operations from about the end of the year. To enter use as a Level C device, the simulator will later be certificated to the Level D standard, potentially enabling pilots to achieve a zero flight-time conversion to the A400M.

A CAE cockpit-maintenance trainer will also enter use in August, and a Rheinmetall-produced cargo hold trainer will be available from March 2013. The latter will support loadmaster instruction, including for applications such as airdrop.

With the initial work for France to be at its most intensive between October and December, the company will employ other assets, including its ""aircraft zero"" systems simulator and production-standard development aircraft MSN6.

Early training for all A400M nations will be conducted using the ITC. In-country facilities will follow for the French air force and UK Royal Air Force at their Orléans and Brize Norton bases, with Germany yet to announce the location for its domestic infrastructure. Belgium, Luxembourg and Spain will send personnel to Seville, while Turkey's plans are yet to be confirmed.

The annual throughput at the ITC is about 1,000 people, including pilots, maintainers and mission system operators from nations including Chile, Egypt and Indonesia, who can also learn in Seville while using their own aircraft.

""Once at full speed on the A400M it will probably be around 2,000,"" Burrett says. ""The students also learn from each other, which is a real benefit of a multinational programme.""

Scrapped A320 planes spark row in Air India - Business Today,"Mon, 14 May 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzdG9kYXkuaW4vaW5kdXN0cnkvYXZpYXRpb24vc3Rvcnkvc2NyYXBwZWQtYTMyMC1wbGFuZXMtc3Bhcmstcm93LWluLWFpci1pbmRpYS0zMDY2OS0yMDEyLTA1LTE00gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"14 Airbus A320 aircraft of state-run Air India were scrapped



$20 mn is the cost of over 1,150 parts in each Airbus A320 when bought new



$210 mn is value of parts which should have been removed from scrapped A320s





A major controversy has erupted in Air India (AI) over expensive usable components not being removed from 13 Airbus A320s which were scrapped and could have enabled the cash-strapped airline to save crores of rupees.Official records accessed byshow the Hyderabad region of AI handled one of the 14 Airbus A320s that were scrapped and removed 1,158 parts for subsequent use in the A320s being used for regular flights. Proper records have also been maintained of these cannibalised spare parts in Hyderabad. However, the Delhi region, which insiders say handled the removing of 13 vintage A320 aircraft, removed only 650 components from each plane. Sources disclose each vintage aircraft has over 1,150 costly components which cost $15 to $20 million when new.These parts can be removed and serviced for repair and maintenance of the regular airline fleet, which helps save money. The total value of the components that should have been removed works out to $210 million (Rs 1,100 crore).The Delhi region, by not removing as many as 500 components in each scrapped plane, is reported to have caused a huge loss to the airline. According to an official statement sent by the carrier to: ""A list of items that needed to be cannibalised was firmed up based on experience viz. their regular usage (fast moving), commonality with new fleet, etc. As against the aircraft in Delhi, the aircraft at Hyderabad happened to be cannibalised more since the cannibalisation list was firmed up at Delhi later. Therefore, more items were cannibalised at Hyderabad as compared to Delhi.""Insiders also allege that even several removed parts do not tally with records of AI and are suspected to be missing. However, the management denies this. The official statement said, ""All the removed items have been well accounted for. Items are located at different locations due to handling procedures viz. installation on aircraft, bench check in the shops, some awaiting dispatch for repair to vendors and some in transit between various locations. Hence, saying that the items had gone missing is a wrong perception.""Interestingly, it took Mail Today nearly three weeks of repeated emails and phone calls to get the AI version on the issue.

Why business travellers will love the Airbus A350 - Executive Traveller,"Fri, 25 May 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vd2h5LWJ1c2luZXNzLXRyYXZlbGxlcnMtd2lsbC1sb3ZlLXRoZS1haXJidXMtYTM1MC14d2LSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"There's a new Airbus coming to town, and we think business travellers will love it.

That plane is the Airbus A350 XWB, which like the Boeing 787 is an advanced next-generation design with over 50% of the aircraft built composite materials such as carbon fibre.

It'll start commercial flights from 2014 on airlines including Cathay Pacific, Emirates, Singapore Airlines and Qatar.

And the reasons you'll love it? Here are three of them.

'Just right' size: bigger than an A330, smaller than a 777

You won't be surprised that a plane whose initials standing for ""Extra Wide Body"" is wide. Really wide.

But the design decisions Airbus has made -- including creating a noticeably tall plane with an oval-shaped cabin -- mean extra room where it counts: from hip to shoulder.

In pure cabin width, the A350 is broader than the A330 that you'll have travelled on with Qantas or Virgin Australia, and eighteen inches wider than the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, its closest competitor.

At 5.96m (19 feet 6 inches) across, long haul business class will mostly be a 1-2-1 configuration, while regional business class is most likely to end up as 2-3-2, with a dreaded middle seat.

Find out more about Airbus' plans for A350 business class in the pointy end and economy class down the back of the bus.

Frequent flyers will cheer Airbus' new design for overhead bins, which ditches the old slam-door style in favour of super-sized swing bins similar to those introduced by Boeing.

Enough space for five rollaboard carry-on bags in each overhead bin is promised, with Airbus claiming that this is one extra bag per larger A350 bin compared with a 787 bin.

New construction methods provide a new cabin 'feel'

Since the A350 is made out of an increased proportion of modern composite materials rather than metal, the cabin pressure can be lower than previous generations, down to 6000 feet from the previous 8000 feet.

That means, like the 787, that the effects of altitude on your body are less, making travelling less tiring and jetlag less disruptive to your system.

Windows on board the A350 are extra-wide too: wider than the 787's but not as tall. Travellers who enjoy looking out the window will be pleased by the improvements from current aircraft.

You won't see Boeing 787 Dreamliner style polarising windowshades on board the A350, though.

Airbus has opted for conventional pull-up shades, saying the tried-and-tested technology is faster and more effective at blocking out light.

Fourth-generation inflight entertainment

Without getting too technical, Airbus is promising an even more all-singing, all-dancing entertainment system than you'd find today.

Panasonic's eX3 and Thales' TopSeries AVANT are currently the two options available for A350s, which provide more entertainment than you'll know what to do with.

To remain connected, Airbus is promising SBB (Swift Broadband) standard, plus Ku band currently available and next-gen Ka band when it's available.

Photos: Airbus A350 business class designs showcase long-haul luxe - Executive Traveller,"Fri, 25 May 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4ZWN1dGl2ZXRyYXZlbGxlci5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWZ1bGx5LWZsYXQtYmVkcy1saWUtZmxhdC1zZWF0cy1pbi1hMzUwLXh3Yi1idXNpbmVzcy1jbGFzc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus is planning ultra-comfortable seats for long distance flights on its new A350 XWB when the plane makes its debut in 2014.

Zuzana Hrnkova, Airbus' cabin interiors exec, confirmed to Australian Business Traveller that both fully flat beds and angled lie-flat seats are on the cards for the XWB (or ""Extra Wide Body"") airliner.

Airbus' early A350 models used the Sogerma Solstys seat as a demonstrator. That's a very comfortable, very spacious fully flat bed in the staggered layout with direct aisle access.

The Solstys is the business class seat you'll see on Etihad's flights to and from Australia, and is a similar kind of layout to Emirates' A380 business class, in a staggered 1-2-1 configuration.

For shorter routes, Airbus is also planning to offer Sogerma's Equinox seat in a 2-2-2 layout across the A350's extra wide body.

Passengers on Cathay Pacific -- an early A350 customer -- will be pleased to see that Cathay's new business class, a modified Sicma Zodiac Cirrus, is on the cards.

Sicma Zodiac is ""soon to become [an] Airbus Contracted Supplier"" and is planning a 1-2-1 reverse herringbone configuration (which Cathay Pacific modified to make its very popular new business class).

For shorter regional flights, Sicma Zodiac's 2-3-2 layout Arcus seats are ""under study"", while Jamco's Journey 2-3-2 seats have also been approved for installation.

Airbus Military focusing on African market - defenceWeb,"Wed, 23 May 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuY2V3ZWIuY28uemEvaW5kdXN0cnkvaW5kdXN0cnktaW5kdXN0cnkvYWlyYnVzLW1pbGl0YXJ5LWZvY3VzaW5nLW9uLWFmcmljYW4tbWFya2V0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Military expects to sell 70 light and medium military aircraft to Africa over the next decade, as it shifts it focus to the African continent and other emerging markets. Ghana, Cameroon and Gabon are some of the nations that are in the midst of buying new aircraft or are about to sign, whilst South Africa is a leading potential customer for the C295.

Airbus Military said that countries in sub-Saharan Africa will buy 50 light and medium aircraft over the next ten years, and that countries on the whole continent (excluding those in the Middle East) will purchase a total of 70.

Antonio Rodriguez Barberan, Senior Vice President: Commercial at Airbus, told defenceWeb that Airbus was in very preliminary discussions with Ghana for the acquisition of two more C295 transports. Ghana took delivery of its second C295 on April 25 and has a requirement for another two. Barberan said the Ghana Air Force was making good use of its new aircraft, flying them around Africa. Ultimately, it wants to base two transports in the capital Accra and another two in Tamale. Airbus said that Ghana may order another two C295s next year.

In August last year the contract for Ghana’s two C295s was announced, and the first was delivered in November. The C295s are being used for troop transport, medical evacuation, paratrooping, training and humanitarian operations, including United Nations peace missions.

Barberan said that an impending order for CN235s is coming from Cameroon, which recently signed a contract but had problems financing the new aircraft. A few weeks ago Cameroon obtained financing for the order, which will soon be announced by Airbus Military once it is firmed up.

Meanwhile, Gabon is one of several nations interested in acquiring C295s to be operated on behalf of the United Nations. The United Nations has also expressed interest in acquiring the C-295 to replace its old, inefficient Russian aircraft. Last year the UN invited Airbus to demonstrate the C-295 in the DRC, which Airbus duly did in July. Another demonstration took place this year. The United Nations does not own its own aircraft, but operates aircraft leased by contributor nations. Airbus Military, the United Nations and its partner nations are discussing possible procurement of the C-295, with Gabon emerging as a likely customer.

In October 2010 Egypt signed a contract for three C295s, and received its first in September last year. Airbus Military told journalists at its annual Trade Media Briefing in Spain that Egypt this year placed an order for an additional three C295s.

Airbus recently flew a C295 out to Africa for a demonstration tour, showing the aircraft to Kenya and Tanzania, amongst others. At the moment there is “no real interest” in the C295 from African countries following the tour, but Barberan is confident that orders will materialise. During its demonstration tour, Airbus Military demonstrated the C295 to the South African Air Force in April, in the hopes of receiving orders to fulfil its transport and maritime patrol requirements.

“Airbus Military has a long established partnership with South Africa and the SA Air Force. By bringing the C-295 to South Africa, we are able to demonstrate the aircraft’s capabilities in typical SANDF [South African National Defence Force] mission configurations for tactical transport, medevac, anti-piracy, countersmuggling and Economic Exclusion Zone protection operations,” Barberan said at the time.

On Monday Airbus Military announced that Oman had ordered eight C295s, including five configured as tactical transports and three as maritime patrol aircraft, for delivery in 2013. This setup could be emulated by South Africa, which could acquire the Fully Integrated Tactical System (FITS) mission suite for maritime patrol duties. This comprises a search radar, electro-optical/infrared sensor, magnetic anomaly detector and hardpoints for torpedoes and depth charges.

Head of Airbus Military, Domingo Urena-Raso, yesterday told defenceWeb that there are several key countries his company is targeting in Africa, including Egypt, Algeria, Morocco and South Africa. He said that although most African countries order only a few aircraft, when put together Africa offers a very reasonable volume of business.

Urena-Raso said that South Africa is a market for both the C295 as well as the A400M and that even though the South African government cancelled its previous order, the A400M “will come later” to South Africa. Airbus Military recently started marketing the airlifter to foreign countries, and sent it on a sales tour to Asia and Latin America.

After South Africa ordered the A400M, Denel Saab Aerostructures (Denel Aerostructures today) and other local companies began manufacturing components for the aircraft. Urena-Raso said that Airbus Military was satisfied with Denel’s performance and will continue to work with the company as far as they keep performing. In fact, Airbus Military and Denel Aerostructures have negotiated a new contract that will be signed in the coming weeks and will see Denel increase A400M component production.

Total Airbus Military sales in sub-Saharan Africa to the first quarter of this year include two C295s, six CN235s and 42 C212s with 14 customers in 11 countries.

Lack of competition on BFA - Australian Defence Magazine,"Fri, 11 May 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5kZWZlbmNlLmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzL2xhY2stb2YtY29tcGV0aXRpb24tb24tYmZh0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Yesterday when ADM asked the Minster Smith “What happened to the competition?” in the wake of the announcement about the C-27J FMS purchase, he confidently answered that one had been run.

In response to this, Airbus Military has released the statement below:

“Airbus Military is obliged to place on the public record our disappointment at the Minister’s choice of words, because there was no tender process and certainly no competition.

“We are even more disappointed that this decision appears not to have been made out of rigorous evaluation of tender-quality information for which Australia is justly renowned and which is normally required before such large sums of taxpayer dollars are spent. The Department of Defence seems to have rejected its own tried, tested and proven process of evaluating competing platforms. Following the selection last year of a new naval combat helicopter, the Department of Defence stated publicly that holding a competition between the two contenders had resulted in a 25 per cent savings in acquisition cost.

“We certainly do not begrudge the ADF making decisions about preferred capability and platforms following careful consideration of tender-quality and commercially-binding information. But on this occasion, selection of the C-27J for $1.4 billion seems to have been based largely on the RAAF’s own desktop assessments. When compared to other projects with similar size price tags that go through an arduous process of tender responses and deep investigation of all areas concerning ownership of a capability, this effort falls short of a full evaluation process.

“Airbus Military proposed the C-295 aircraft as the Caribou replacement. The C-295, like the C-27J, has recognised strengths and weaknesses. The C-295 is the world’s most popular battlefield airlifter, with global sales at 100 units. It is cheaper to buy and operate than the C-27J. For the RAAF’s fleet of 10 Battlefield Airlifters, a C-295 purchase, offered at 400 million AUD would have provided savings of $1 billion compared to the C-27J FMS. In addition, the industry involvement Airbus Military had committed to the Department of Defence and Industry had substantial components for Australian Small/Medium Enterprises (SME’s) we doubt could be complied through an FMS case.

“In the current climate of fiscal restraint and public concerns over Government waste and expenditure, it is surprising that the opportunity to save at least $1 billion AUD of taxpayer’s money was not sufficient justification to hold a competition to determine which aircraft option represented the best overall value for money.

“It should also be noted that Australia has committed $1.4 billion to an aircraft that will be delivered in 2015 only, representing a three year time gap. Airbus Military is of the opinion a competition could have been done in this period, complying with the same schedule, as the C295 could be available in a six months time period.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9994557499885559}",neutral,0.9994557499885559,0
