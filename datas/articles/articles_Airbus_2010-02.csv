The transport aircraft was supposed to compete with the Boeing (BA) C-17 strategic transport and the smaller Lockheed Martin (LMT) C-130 aircraft which dominate NATO countries and foreign sales. Made by Airbus, a subsidiary of EADS (EADS:P), and its seven European customers, the A400M was supposed to be a low-risk concept. The program started in 2003 with EADS agreeing to a fixed-price contract to develop, test and start production. France, Germany, Great Britain, Spain and the other buyers paid up front to cover this activity.

Things didn't work out that simply.

The program took longer and cost a great deal more then planned due to problems with the engines and software. The first flight took place in December 2009, two years behind schedule, and the first deliveries won't be until 2012, three years late. EADS has for the last two years been burning through about $100 million of its own each month and taken total charges for the program of $3.6 billion.

The company and its customers have been negotiating for a year to figure out what to do next. Due to the desire to see the program through, the buyers delayed implementing clauses to make EADS to pay them back, with penalties. EADS demanded a resolution by February 1st.

It looks like a plan has been worked out. EADS will receive $2.04 billion in direct aid to offset losses that would have been reported for the 2009 earnings year. The company will also get a ten percent increase in the price of the aircraft to about $194 million each. If all of the planned sales go through this will generate another $2.7 billion in revenue to help make up for the money EADS spent on the program.

The $2.04 billion infusion is a godsend to EADS. Without it, the company might have had to write off the whole cost of the program at a time when it is already hurting from lower demand for its airliners, especially the A380, and its Eurocopter helicopters.

One issue the agreement won't solve is that three-year delay in the program. Lockheed and Boeing have been selling quite a number of their transports to a diverse set of customers, including Canada, Great Britain, India, and the U.A.E. Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan demand large amounts of lift, both tactical and strategic, so countries like the U.S., Canada and Great Britain who are heavily involved in operations there have been buying these aircraft and helicopters in sizable numbers.

The A400M was supposed to be flying by 2009 at the latest to get a piece of this action. But it was only able to line up two overseas customers--South Africa and Malaysia--and South Africa has canceled, due to the cost increases.

The European countries that support EADS and Airbus wanted a military product competitive with the world's best. They wanted it do it quickly and fairly cheaply to demonstrate their industry's capability, keep people employed and perhaps get some market share. None of this has happened.

The A400M has demonstrated, once again, that defense development and acquisition is not easy. Agreeing to a fixed-price contract for a program that ended up being more difficult and complex then planned hamstrung EADS and its buyers. They were faced with a stark choice of writing off seven years of effort and billions of dollars or working out a way to keep the program alive despite stretched budgets. In the end it looked like keeping the aircraft and the 10,000 jobs related to it trumped other considerations."

So with the 787, it was just faith. It might have worked with traditional designs, but with composites and new techniques, it was guaranteed to be a disaster.”

Toulouse Goose

The problems and delays contributed to the $3.5 billion in charges the company took last year. And Boeing found it necessary to buy the South Carolina plant of Vought, which had fallen behind on its fuselage work, and to build a second fuselage assembly line. The company recognized belatedly that its outsourcing had gone too far, says Morris Cohen, a professor of manufacturing and logistics at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. “We see more and more outsourcing of manufacturing, globally, in high-tech industries,” Cohen says. “We are discovering that as you move down that path, the challenges are not trivial. I don’t think companies have paid enough attention to how to manage supply chains from a strategic perspective.”

The clearest consequence, besides the costly delays, is that the first few 787s will probably be heavier than the targeted 108 tons. Nevertheless, the first 787s are scheduled to be delivered this year. And as long as the plane ultimately performs as advertised, the delays may not harm Boeing’s long-term reputation. “Boeing can very easily redeem itself by producing a product that the market wants,” says Aboulafia. Airlines and passengers, he adds, “remember the product, not how it was executed.”

Meanwhile, the Airbus A380 program has faced its own manufacturing glitches. More significant, the plane has found relatively few buyers; with a capacity between 525 and 853 passengers, it is simply too big to make sense for many airlines. Whereas Boeing has logged more than 800 orders for the 787, only about 200 have come in for the A380, earning the aircraft–whose maker is headquartered in Toulouse, France–the nickname “Toulouse Goose,” after Howard Hughes’s infamous “Spruce Goose,” the wood-framed World War II-era behemoth that never made it beyond a single prototype.

Even if the 787 passes through all the turbulence, Boeing can’t rest for long. Airbus now has a 787 competitor waiting in the wings: the midsize A350, also 50 percent composite. About 500 orders have come in, and Airbus says it’s on track to start delivering the aircraft in 2013. So in a sense, the 787 program seems likely to pay off one way or another. If it provided a hard lesson about the limits of outsourcing and the risks of innovating with composite materials, the bold design also gave Boeing a much-needed head start on the next phase of innovation in commercial aviation.

Airbus and Boeing see thawing of A380/747 demand this year - Flightglobal,"Mon, 22 Feb 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWFuZC1ib2Vpbmctc2VlLXRoYXdpbmctb2YtYTM4MC83NDctZGVtYW5kLXRoaXMteWVhci85MjA0NC5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus and Boeing are hopeful that 2010 will see orders begin to rebound for their ultra-large airliners, although both acknowledge that the market remains tough in the aftermath of last year's global downturn.

In 2009 Airbus and Boeing secured just nine new ultra-large aircraft orders - four A380s and five 747-8s. However, while Airbus did not suffer any A380 cancellations, its US rival lost three 747-8 orders, dropping its net sales to two units and the A380/747 combined total to six aircraft.

Boeing chief executive James McNerney expects that orders will begin coming in for the 747-8 later in 2010: ""I think you're going to see some thaw in this market toward the second half of this year. You'll see some orders that are in the midst of discussions right now,"" McNerney told delegates at the Cowen and Company Aerospace/Defence Conference in Cleveland, Ohio in mid-February.

McNerney appeared to signal that the all-cargo 747-8F, rather than the -8I passenger model, was the leading candidate for more orders in the near term. Freight operators ""have been focused wholly on getting capacity out for the last 18 months, now they realise they may be short. So we're getting pickup on discussions on the freighter side,"" he said.

At the Singapore air show in early February, Airbus's chief operating officer customers John Leahy acknowledged that ""there won't be an awful lot"" of A380 orders this year, but indicated that 2010 should start to see a recovery. ""The number of A380 orders this year will probably be around 10,"" he said. ""We're still in a bit of a recession and in down periods the 747/A380 category is the one that the big carriers tend put off the decision to order.""

McNerney concurs, saying that the current trading conditions make selling the passenger version of the 747-8I difficult. ""We've kept a lot of passenger discussions warm on this side, but no-one is buying $250 million machines. We're hopeful that some things could popthe recession has not helped its marketing,"" he said in Cleveland.

Despite the slow sales pace of the A380 in recent years, Airbus is still resolute in its view that the 202 orders taken so far are just the tip of the iceberg in the long-term market, and expects the Asian carriers to be key to untapping this demand.

""We see the Asian market accounting for more than half of the A380's forecast open demand over the next 20 years,"" says A380 product marketing chief Richard Carcaillet. That equates to Asia needing around 880 of forecast 1,300 ultra-large airliners to be delivered. ""We think the A380 will claim the bulk of this demand,"" he adds.

Carcaillet, who predicts that the major A380 operators will eventually have fleets of ""50 aircraft or more"", expects the double-decker's demonstrated strong passenger appeal will drive up sales. ""The A380 is a real 'passenger magnet' - they are operating today at load factors above 80%. When the upturn comes these characteristics will be magnified - and the operators that don't have A380s yet are watching very closely,"" he says.

EADS presented with 'final offer' to rescue A400M military aircraft deal - FRANCE 24 English,"Wed, 17 Feb 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyYW5jZTI0LmNvbS9lbi8yMDEwMDIxNy1lYWRzLWV4cGVjdGVkLWJhY2stYTQwMG0tbWlsaXRhcnktYWlyY3JhZnQtZnVuZGluZy1zb2x1dGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"AVIATION

European aerospace group EADS, the parent company of Airbus, is under pressure to accept a revised offer - worth 3.5 billion euros - from seven European countries to rescue the A400M military transport plane project.

REUTERS - Airbus parent EADS faced intense pressure on Wednesday to accept a revised offer from European nations to rescue the A400M military airlifter project after rampant overspending cast a shadow over 10,000 jobs.

Seven countries that ordered the European army plane in 2003 have presented what officials described as a ""final"" offer worth 3.5 billion euros in price and loan support to the planemaker in a bid to end months of wrangling over the project's future.



France, the second-largest customer behind Germany, said there would be no more money on the table after the latest offer, which would leave EADS absorbing losses of some 1.7 billion euros on top of 2.4 billion it has already written off.



""This is an important step and we have reached the end of the line,"" Defence Minister Heve Morin told Les Echos newspaper.



With crucial details to be ironed out, EADS may take more time to assess the implications of the deal, but defence sources said it was expected to back the key points soon.



EADS shares traded more than five percent higher at 14.51 euros as investors concluded that a deal was drawing close.



The A400M is Europe's biggest defence project and hailed as a driver of efforts to cut across national boundaries in arms acquisition as well as EADS's ambitions to become a global defence player, matching its Airbus civil jet business.

The hulking troop carrier is designed to fill a gap between the veteran Lockheed Martin C-130 Hercules and the larger jet-powered C-17 from Boeing , but has been plagued by problems in developing its powerful turbo-prop engines.



Not ready before 2013



The A400M made a debut flight in December and will not be ready for military or humanitarian missions before late 2013.



NATO partners Britain, France, Germany, Spain, Belgium, Luxembourg and Turkey ordered 180 planes for almost 20 billion euros but the cost of building them is set to top 30 billion.



After cost savings and write-downs, EADS has been in talks with buyers to plug a remaining gap of 5.2 billion euros. Failure to strike a deal could hit 10,000 production jobs.



EADS said on Tuesday it had received the latest offer from seven governments and would respond in due course.

But time is running out as it faces pressure not just from government buyers but also from its own auditors, who are seen as increasingly reluctant to let EADS defer potentially hefty charges beyond its fourth-quarter 2009 results due on March 9.



Internal voices are also pushing for a rapid deal, with Airbus threatening to cut investment and divert engineers to the company's latest airliner project.



The largest shareholder in EADS, German car firm Daimler, whose finance chief is also chairman of EADS, reports earnings on Thursday and would have to recognise any significant losses or write-downs if it was aware of them.



Sources familiar with the talks said that in addition to offering a price increase of 2 billion euros, buyers were prepared to stump up guarantees of 1.5 billion euros, part of which would be repaid as royalties on future exports.



How that is packaged could determine the size of provisions since loans cannot be used to curtail charges.

Facing weak budgets, some nations may opt to take fewer planes rather than spending new cash to fund part of the deal.



But there were signs of last-minute squabbling among buyers as Britain fought for as much as possible of the 1.5 billion euro top-up to be reimbursable to taxpayers. One report said Britain may opt out of the additional part of the offer.

"Bird strikes plane, forces landing at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport - Palm Beach Post","Tue, 16 Feb 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhbG1iZWFjaHBvc3QuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvY3JpbWUvMjAxMC8wMi8xNi9iaXJkLXN0cmlrZXMtcGxhbmUtZm9yY2VzLWxhbmRpbmcvNzE1ODA1OTAwNy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bird strikes plane, forces landing at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport No injuries in incident involving Spirit Airlines jet airliner

A Spirit Airlines plane made an unscheduled return to Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on Monday after a bird struck the jet's nose after takeoff, the Federal Aviation Administration said.

No one was hurt, officials said. About two-thirds of the passengers from Flight 758 were placed on a smaller jet that left the Fort Lauderdale airport for New York's LaGuardia Airport at 2:15 p.m., said Spirit Airlines spokeswoman Misty Pinson. The rest of the passengers were placed on other flights to New York, Pinson said.

An inspection found no damage to the plane, an Airbus A321, Pinson said.

The flight had originally departed at about 11 a.m. from Fort Lauderdale and was in the air when the bird hit the plane's radome, a weatherproof enclosure at the nose of the aircraft, said Kathleen Bergen, FAA spokeswoman.

After the bird strike, the plane appeared intact. Still, the pilot returned to Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport as a precaution.

To lighten the aircraft before landing, the pilot burned off fuel for 20 to 30 minutes, Bergen said.

The plane then landed safely in Fort Lauderdale with 215 passengers and crew on board.

U.S. airplanes collide with birds more than 2,500 times a year, according to federal aviation authorities. The vast majority, 80 percent, occur near airports, which provide birds with lots of grass and a natural habitat.

At Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International, birds and planes collided 19 times in 2008, officials said.

Bird strikes on average cause about $400 million in damage in the United States, authorities said. Birds can be ingested into engines and break windscreens, making for a potentially deadly event.

However, the vast majority of the strikes result in little more than minor damage to an aircraft, and as a result most strikes go unreported, according to the FAA.

In most cases involving airliners, if a bird gets sucked into an engine, a flight is forced to return for landing.

The most famous bird-strike incident: The Miracle on the Hudson. On Jan. 15, 2009, a U.S. Airways Airbus A320 flew into a flock of Canadian geese shortly after takeoff from La Guardia and lost power in both engines. The jetliner was forced to ditch in the Hudson River. All 155 passengers and crew members escaped unhurt.

The number of significant bird strikes, causing serious damage to an aircraft, is estimated to be less than 10 per year.

Fatal bird strikes are extremely rare. Worldwide, in aviation history, fewer than 400 people have been killed as a result of bird collisions, and most of those were in general aviation planes.

Fewer than 10 deaths have been reported in the United States and Canada in the past decade, according to Bird Strike U.S.A., an organization that collaborates with the FAA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to keep track of strikes.

The reason birds love to hang out at airports: Fences keep out their natural enemies and grassy infields provide food, mainly bugs.

South Florida's airports take a number of steps to scare birds away, including pyrotechnics, explosives, firearms, scarecrows, chemical repellants and pre-recorded bird distress calls. Some airports also use special dogs to chase the birds away.

"Fly by Wire: The Geese, the Glide, the 'Miracle' on the Hudson by William Langewiesche - The Guardian","Sat, 27 Feb 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9ib29rcy8yMDEwL2ZlYi8yNy9mbHktYnktd2lyZS13aWxsaWFtLWxhbmdld2llc2NoZdIBTmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9ib29rcy8yMDEwL2ZlYi8yNy9mbHktYnktd2lyZS13aWxsaWFtLWxhbmdld2llc2NoZQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"William Langewiesche has a simple, but important, tale to tell and, for the most part, he tells it very well indeed. On 15 January 2009, US Airways flight 1549 from LaGuardia, New York to Charlotte, North Carolina collided with a flock of Canada geese while climbing through 2,700ft above the Bronx river, a minute and a half after take-off. The birds were sucked into the fans of the jet engines of the Airbus A320, and these failed.

With professional aplomb, 58-year-old Captain Chesley Sullenberger brought the aircraft down safely, and smoothly in the circumstances, on the Hudson river. Although a few were injured, all 150 passengers and five crew survived. The flight had lasted five minutes and eight seconds.

What Langewiesche, a working pilot for 15 years and, today, Vanity Fair's international correspondent, discovers in the course of this short book about an even briefer flight is that Sullenberger's skill and exemplary calmness under pressure were matched and in certain key ways bettered by the fly-by-wire technology of his aircraft.

The unsung hero of the hour, whom Langewiesche seeks out, was Bernard Ziegler, former senior vice-president for engineering at Airbus. This former French Air Force fighter pilot and Algerian war veteran not only test-piloted the Airbus A320 but was the brains behind its revolutionary ""flight envelope protection"" system. This allows the A320 to be flown to its limits without pilots being able to over-extend the aircraft. In other words, the A320 is capable of looking after itself when pilots mess up. If, of course, it's being flown far too low, or towards a mountain, there is little the A320 can to do save itself, its passengers and crew.

It might be, according to Lange­wiesche, the ""most audacious civil airplane since the Wright brothers' Flyer"", but the A320 is not a sentient being, nor some omnipotent computer. And yet, when things go wrong, especially 2,700ft above the Bronx river and with little chance of the pilot getting the aircraft down to a convenient runway, the A320 has proven to be little short of a mechanical guardian angel.

So there was no ""miracle"", as the press called it, on the Hudson. Sullenberger did his job perfectly well, as did the Airbus. A case, you might say, of man and machine in perfect harmony. End of short story. Lange­wiesche, though, has other things on his mind. His intimately detailed story of how airliners became more intelligent or safer through design, mirrors a tale of how airline pilots have become increasingly marginalised in a deregulated, low-cost industry, in which the romance of flight and the Jovian status of the pilot have given way to staff putting in more hours for less pay and airlines turning aircraft around at airports faster than car rental agencies wash and refuel a Ford Fiesta. While Langewiesche is hugely impressed, even awe-struck by the charismatic Ziegler, he sees, as clearly as pilots should, that the arrival of the Airbus 320 a quarter of a century ago helped spell the end of the commercial pilot as a truly commanding figure and hero.

The particular circumstances of 15 January 2009, however, did make ­Captain Sullenberger a hero. Lange­wiesche revels in the technical wizardry of the A320, yet, as he explains, it was still Sullenberger's decision not to turn back to LaGuardia – computer simulations after the event showed that he would have crashed – and to use his pilot's intuition and skill to put the aircraft safely into water.

Here then is a crisply, meticulously and dramatically told account of the as yet unresolved story of how humans and advanced technology are learning to form a partnership, with what ultimate consequences we of the early computer and turbo-fan jet age will not live to discover. Langewiesche is a reliable guide to these pioneering days of what, in the right hands – those of Sullenberger and Ziegler – is, hopefully, the start of a beautiful friendship.

There's one thing, though, that grates throughout Fly by Wire: while Americans are essentially good old boys (and girls), tales of comparable air incidents prove that Latins are hysterical – ""Pray! Pray! Pray!"" they scream – while the English, old-fashioned in an Anne-Hathaway's-cottage way, are amusingly effete.

Langewiesche also pursues his baiting of non-Americans in a ripping collection of aviation articles, Aloft (Penguin, £10.99). In the ­introduction, he writes: ""I never wanted to write about flight. It is a genre too easily confused with false heroics, or worse, with tedious transportation history of the British plane-spotter kind."" Don't worry, though. Aloft is shot through with all the ­technical stuff a warm beer-drinking Limey might enjoy. It abounds in heart-pounding disasters, inept, screeching foreigners and the poetry of the heavens. It's a truly great read for anyone brought up on a tedious diet of Saint-Exupéry, The Eagle, Pierre ­Clostermann, Guy Gibson's Enemy Coast Ahead and Haynes Manuals of Messerschmitts and Spitfires. ­Langewiesche will not be impressed by a British pilot telling him so, yet for all his jaw-jutting, fly'em-cowboy machismo, he writes as if his pen has wings, his laptop a pair of General ­Electric turbofans.

The Last Four Minutes of Air France Flight 447 - ABC News,"Fri, 26 Feb 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vVHJhdmVsL21pbnV0ZXMtYWlyLWZyYW5jZS00NDcvc3Rvcnk_aWQ9OTk1MTg3ONIBSWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjbmV3cy5nby5jb20vYW1wL1RyYXZlbC9taW51dGVzLWFpci1mcmFuY2UtNDQ3L3N0b3J5P2lkPTk5NTE4Nzg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Feb. 26, 2010 -- One tiny technical failure heralded the impending disaster. But the measurement error was so inconspicuous that the pilots in the cockpit of the Airbus A330 probably hardly noticed it.

Air France flight 447 had been in the air for three hours and 40 minutes since taking off from Rio de Janeiro on the evening of May 31, 2009. Strong turbulence had been shaking the plane for half an hour, and all but the hardiest frequent flyers were awake.

Suddenly the gauge indicating the external temperature rose by several degrees, even though the plane was flying at an altitude of 11 kilometers (36,000 feet) and it hadn't got any warmer outside. The false reading was caused by thick ice crystals forming on the sensor on the outside of the plane. These crystals had the effect of insulating the detector. It now appears that this is when things started going disastrously wrong.

Flying through thunderclouds over the Atlantic, more and more ice was hurled at the aircraft. In the process, it knocked out other, far more important, sensors: the pencil-shaped airspeed gauges known as pitot tubes.

One alarm after another lit up the cockpit monitors. One after another, the autopilot, the automatic engine control system, and the flight computers shut themselves off. ""It was like the plane was having a stroke,"" says Gérard Arnoux, the head of the French pilots union SPAF.

The final minutes of flight AF 447 had begun. Four minutes after the airspeed indicator failed, the plane plunged into the ocean, killing all 228 people on board.

Few airline crashes in recent years have subsequently unnerved passengers to quite the same extent. ""How was it possible that an Airbus from such an apparently safe airline could simply disappear?"" they wondered.

Passengers on the Rio-Paris route are still uneasy as they board their plane. After the accident, the flight number was changed to AF 445. Many frequent flyers have since opted for daytime flights across the Atlantic because pilots can recognize storm fronts more easily during the day.

Another large-scale search for the stricken plane's ""black box"" flight recorders is due to begin in the coming weeks. Once again some 2,000 square kilometers (800 square miles) of mountainous ocean floor will be swept, some of it by a submarine from from the northern German city of Kiel. ""We shouldn't speculate about the causes of the accident until the search has been completed,"" says Jean-Paul Troadec, the director of the French air crash investigation agency BEA.

Other experts are less guarded in their comments. ""We know pretty well why the accident happened,"" says union boss Arnoux.

'An Accident Like This Could Happen Again'

Over the course of several months of investigation, experts have gathered evidence that allows them to reconstruct with relative accuracy what happened on board during those last four minutes. It has also brought to light a safety flaw that affects all jet airplanes currently in service. ""An accident like this could happen again at any time,"" Arnoux predicts.

Experts reconstructed dozens of incidents involving Airbus planes to try to piece together the puzzle of this particular disaster. Plane wreckage and body parts give crucial clues as to what brought the plane down. Crash investigators also conducted detailed analyses of the 24 automatic fault messages that the aircraft sent to Air France headquarters by satellite in the run-up to the accident. One particular message -- the very last one transmitted before impact -- could solve the mystery surrounding flight AF 447.

A half moon lit up the Atlantic Ocean on the night of May 31, offering reasonably favorable conditions for a flight through the dangerous intertropical convergence zone. That's where violent thunderstorms rage and columns of thick clouds bar the way like an aerial obstacle course. In addition to the on-board radar, the moon helps pilots identify dangerous cloud formations and take appropriate measures.

On the night of the tragedy, other planes diverted their flight paths and took a detour around the danger zone.

Why then did flight AF 447 head straight into the deadly storm system? Is it possible that the tragedy began even before the plane took off?

Galeão Airport, Rio de Janeiro, 6pm local time: Preparation for takeoff

Captain Marc Dubois, 58, goes through the flight plan of AF 447: He enters a starting weight of 232.757 tons into the on-board computer, 243 kilograms less than the maximum permissible weight for the A330. As well as the passengers' luggage, the ground crews load 10 tons of freight into the cargo bay. Dubois has more than 70 tons of kerosene pumped into the fuel tanks. That sounds a lot more than it actually is, because the plane consumes up to 100 kilograms of kerosene every minute. The fuel reserves don't give much leeway.

It's only by means of a trick that the captain can even reach Paris without going under the legally required minimum reserves of kerosene that must still be in the plane's tanks upon arrival in the French capital. A loophole allows him to enter Bordeaux -- which lies several hundred kilometers closer than Paris -- as the fictitious destination for his fuel calculations.

""Major deviation would therefore no longer have been possible anymore,"" says Gerhard Hüttig, an Airbus pilot and professor at the Berlin Technical University's Aerospace Institute. If worse came to worst, the pilot would have to stop and refuel in Bordeaux, or maybe even in Lisbon. ""But pilots are very reluctant to do something like that,"" Hüttig adds. After all, it makes the flight more expensive, causes delays and is frowned upon by airline bosses.

After takeoff, Dubois quickly takes the plane up to a cruising altitude of 35,000 feet (10.6 kilometers), an altitude known as ""flight level 350."" According to his kerosene calculations, he has to climb far further, to above 11 kilometers, where the thin air reduces his fuel consumption.

It's not known whether he actually reached this altitude. Three hours after leaving Rio, Captain Dubois contacted Brazilian air traffic control for the last time. ""Flight level 350,"" he reported. It was to be his last communication with the outside world."
"Fly By Wire: The Geese, the Glide and the Miracle on the Hudson by William Langewiesche - The Guardian","Sat, 13 Feb 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9ib29rcy8yMDEwL2ZlYi8xNC9mbHktYnktd2lyZS1ib29rLXJldmlld9IBRWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9ib29rcy8yMDEwL2ZlYi8xNC9mbHktYnktd2lyZS1ib29rLXJldmlldw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Since this is a book about quick ­reactions, it seems appropriate to ask: after Captain Chesley Sullenberger ditched his Airbus A320 in the icy waters of the Hudson river on 15 January 2009, how long did it take William Langewiesche to decide that the events of that day would be the subject of his next book?

His last, The Atomic Bazaar, delved into the murky trade in secondhand nuclear materials. Before that, The ­Outlaw Sea covered ship-breaking in Bangladesh, the sinking of a passenger ferry and contemporary piracy (an instance of a reporter being a little too ahead of the curve and getting to a story before it became news). These were subjects that interested and came gradually to absorb him. But Langewiesche, I wager, knew within seconds that the story of Airbus A320 had his name ­written all over it.

His father was a pilot who, in 1944, published Stick and Rudder, a benchmark book on flight and navigation. Not surprisingly, William grew up feeling at home in the sky; he trained and worked as a pilot and, in turn, assembled a book of his own aviation pieces. First published in 1998, Inside the Sky combines meditations on his adventures as a pilot and meticulously investigated reports on air crashes. (The essays in that book form the core of an updated and expanded collection, Aloft, to be published as a Penguin Modern ­Classic later this month.) So Langewiesche was uniquely qualified to write about the Hudson ditching. Beyond the realm of sympathetic expertise, however, was a subtler recognition of the subject's broader themes.

Sully's successful crash-landing – not a single life lost – was a symbolic reversal of the catastrophe of 9/11. In ­American Ground (2003), Langewiesche had tracked what he called ""the unbuilding of the World Trade Center"", the long operation to recover bodies and clear up the devastation at Ground Zero. Although full of praise for the people ""without previous rank who discovered balance and ability within themselves"" during the excavation, he was, nevertheless, rigorously unsentimental. At a time when the moral authority of the New York City Fire Department was unimpeachable, Langewiesche was pilloried for unearthing incontestable evidence – the cab of a wrecked fire truck, for example, ""filled with dozens of new pairs of jeans from the Gap""– of looting by some firemen.

Demonstrating a similar willingness to confront ""a complex and emotional subject"", he is just as adamant about rescuing ""the Miracle on the Hudson"" from the realm of instant myth. The plane lost both engines to a low-altitude strike by Canada geese minutes after take-off from New York's ­LaGuardia airport. The crew responded ­perfectly, especially Sullenberger, who ­""ruthlessly shed distractions, including his own fear of death"" as he urged the stricken plane through what remained of the Manhattan sky and on to the ribbon of water. Such grace under pressure is in keeping with our ideal of the pilot, as famously expressed by Saint-Exupéry's flights of Nietzschean lyricism, or, more recently, by the pragmatic drawl of Chuck Yeager – ""I've tried A! – I've tried B! – I've tried C!..."" – in Tom Wolfe's The Right Stuff. Part of the allure of the Hudson ditching, Langewiesche points out, is that it tempted us to forget that the days of the pilot locked in a lone struggle with ­destiny are pretty much gone.

As he repeatedly insists, it's not just the passengers crammed into economy who are fed up with flying, resigned to the ""terrible this-is-my-life monotony of the job""; the pilots themselves are part of ""a once-proud profession"" in ""inexorable decline"". This is partly the drearily familiar saga of demoralisation in the wake of deregulation, wage cuts, longer shifts and so on, but it's also a result of the way that, as more and more control has been ceded to computers, pilots have come to resemble frontline passengers, only in a state of permanent, highly knowledgable alertness. The Hudson landing appeared to restore the lofty agency of the pilot to its rightful place, when, in fact – Langewiesche insists – Sully, for all his skill, had the good fortune to be flying a plane of ""radical semi-robotic European design"". This is the meaning of ""flying by wire"": the aircraft's built-in safety systems are designed always to overrule and correct the pilot, never vice-versa. Not a bad idea since, in the past dozen or so years, ""far more passengers have been killed because of pilots than because of airplane failures"".

A pathological example of the former – the extraordinary story is recounted in Aloft – is the Egyptian pilot who, in 1999, declared: ""I rely on God"" while directing his plane into the sea. Had he been flying an ­Airbus, he would not have been able to do that (and so, paradoxically, his faith might have been justified). A shriller note of fictive resignation is sounded in Don DeLillo's White Noise when a plane goes into a steep dive. Relieved to hear the captain's voice over the intercom, passengers are treated instead to a shrieking announcement of impending doom: ""We're a silver gleaming death machine!""

Sully and his co-pilot, by contrast, kept their cool, kept flying – that's the thing about airborne problems, ""you cannot just pull over and stop"" – and started weighing up their options. He negotiated with air traffic control, decided the Hudson was his best bet, found time to warn (""This is the captain. Brace for impact""), and concentrated on easing the maimed aircraft into the concrete-hard water. Which he did, impeccably. But even if he hadn't, the plane would have overruled him, and did, in fact, iron out a few wrinkles in the glide by ""constantly adjusting the control surfaces to provide an extraordinarily stable platform to fly"". Metaphorically speaking, Sully won the spelling bee – but was wired up to Microsoft spell check just in case. In Langewiesche's words, the plane ""participated actively in the survival of the passengers"".

Much of Fly by Wire is rigorously technical but Langewiesche shares with Len Deighton the ability to imbue aeronautical specs and data with a narrative propulsion of their own. Unlike Sully, he is under no compulsion to shed distractions. On the contrary. There is a mass of information about the nesting and migratory habits of the much-maligned Canada geese who did for the plane and themselves (he even consults an expert who speculates on what might have been going through the minds of the geese as the giant Airbus roared into their patch of sky); on the long history of bird strikes (some of which have occurred at a mind-blowing 37,000ft – how do they breathe up there?); and the demographic make-up of the passengers onboard. At times such unwieldy cargo makes this short book handle a little awkwardly but for most of the ride the method established in Aloft – a writing-by-wire combination of interviews, black-box data, cockpit voice recordings and reporterly nous – winds the reader into a state of white-knuckle absorption. It's a tribute to Langewiesche's narrative command that, although the outcome is known, the penultimate section of the book, as the plane approaches the slim hope of the river, vies in brilliance with James Salter's account of two fighter pilots in Korea nursing their fuel-less jets back to base in his Korean war novel, The Hunters.

The focus, inevitably, is on pilot, crew and air traffic controllers but the passengers and, later, a passing ferry play their part, too. The plane is about to hit the water. A passenger near the back shouts: ""Exit row people get ready!"" Once the plane is in the water there's a bit of a devil-take-the-hindmost stampede but the standard of behaviour remains surprisingly high. Sully is the last person out of his aircraft. It's a wonderful story expertly told, and the ending is not just happy but uplifting: almost everyone involved comes out of it not just safely but extremely well. Except the geese. Their day totally sucked."
Sichuan to use V2500 in Airbus A320 - The Engineer,"Tue, 02 Feb 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWVuZ2luZWVyLmNvLnVrL2NvbnRlbnQvbmV3cy9zaWNodWFuLXRvLXVzZS12MjUwMC1pbi1haXJidXMtYTMyMC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sichuan Airlines confirmed it has selected the IAE International Aero Engines V2500 to power its latest fleet of Airbus A320s, currently on order.

This deal includes V2500 SelectOne engines for 12 firm aircraft, due to be delivered between 2011 and 2015.

In addition, Sichuan has chosen to support these engines with a long-term IAE Aftermarket Services Agreement, where services include overhaul, engine-health monitoring and on-wing coverage.

The total value of this new business is worth $300m (£188m) to IAE.

Sichuan’s current A320 fleet of 61 aircraft in service and on order is powered exclusively by the V2500.

According to IAE, the V2500 powers more than 250 aircraft in service and there are more than 150 IAE-powered aircraft currently on order in the greater China region.

The V2500 was also the launch engine for the Airbus Final Assembly Line China (FALC) in Tianjin in 2009, where nine of the first 10 aircraft produced were powered by IAE, an international consortium made up of Pratt & Whitney, Rolls-Royce, Japanese Aero Engines Corporation and MTU Aero Engines."
Strong Demand for Air Comm AS350 Air Conditioners; Experts Caution Operators About Weight Claims - Vertical Magazine,"Mon, 15 Feb 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3ZlcnRpY2FsbWFnLmNvbS9uZXdzL3N0cm9uZy1kZW1hbmQtZm9yLWFpci1jb21tLWFzMzUwLWFpci1jb25kaXRpb25lcnMtZXhwZXJ0cy1jYXV0aW9uLW9wZXJhdG9ycy1hYm91dC13ZWlnaHQtY2xhaW1zLWh0bWwv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Developed in response to customer requests, demand remains strong for Air Comm Corporation’s vapor-cycle air conditioning system for the AS350 helicopter, with 50 systems sold to date. Air Comm is known for its design innovation, and the AS350 system features the company’s exclusive leak-free Torq-Lok refrigerant fittings and an adjustable mount compressor to allow for quick installation and easy belt alignment.

While other AS350 cooling systems feature large, labor-intensive condenser cutouts, Air Comm’s condenser is discreetly located and not readily noticeable. The only external evidence is a single, six-inch diameter condenser exhaust outlet in the right-hand baggage door. “We found a way to develop exceptional condenser performance, while minimizing our impact to the aesthetics of a really attractive aircraft,” said Company President Keith Steiner. “We call the design the ‘Slim-Line’ condenser, and its performance translates directly to air conditioner cooling performance.”

For truly effective cooling, the air conditioner has two dedicated evaporators to separately cool the cockpit and the cabin. Air Comm system design experts caution operators to be skeptical of claims made about 50-pound air conditioners, because multiple evaporators are needed to cool interiors in a hot and humid environment, such as the Gulf of Mexico. “Air conditioning is a study in trade-offs,” says ACC Project Engineer Jonathan Buczkowski. “They provide the most effective means of cooling most helicopters due to their low horsepower and electrical power requirements. But you have to select components that are large enough to effectively cool the space. You can reduce evaporator size or quantity, but if it doesn’t work, then it doesn’t matter that it’s only 50 pounds you’re carrying useless weight.”

West Country Cash: Airbus' military adventure: Is an A400M deal in the air? - BBC,"Mon, 22 Feb 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jby51ay9ibG9ncy9kYXZlaGFydmV5LzIwMTAvMDIvYWlyYnVzX21pbGl0YXJ5X2FkdmVudHVyZV9pc19hLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"""Common sense will prevail,"" the smiling aviation expert tells me. ""They'll do a deal now, and in my opinion it will be this week.""

Could it really be that soon? Could this controversial aeroplane, three years late and billions of pounds over budget, finally be settled?

It is beginning to look like it. The gap between EADS, Airbus' parent company, and the seven European nations buying the new military cargo plane has narrowed. In an investigation I've made for Inside Out West on BBC One, Philip Lawrence, who's been watching this project from Bristol since its birth in the 1980s, tells me it will happen very soon.

""The countries have come back to EADS with a decent offer,"" he says, ""and now the company must decide. I think they will do a deal this week.""

Originally the 20bn euro budget was bust by some 11bn euros. After cuts on the programme the real gap was 7.6bn, of which EADS was prepared to take 3.2bn itself. A game of extraordinarily high stakes poker followed. Led by the French, who are particularly keen on both the plane and the 10,000 jobs it has created, the nations buying the A400M offered another 2bn euros on the pricetag.

The gap was now 2.4bn euros. Yes, 2,400,000,000 euros.

Still a rather large number, even for a European aerospace giant.

Then, in January, Airbus called the nations' bluff. Tom Enders, the Airbus Chief Exec, threatened to cancel the plane. That's right - call the whole show off. Unless the nations ""came up with a contribution"".

It worked. You don't easily get seven European defence ministers to agree on anything much, but they all want this plane. They think our Hercules fleet is too old, and they don't want to replace it with American C-17s or C-19s.

Another 1.5bn euros appeared; this time as export guarantees, not cash. But good enough.

As I write, the gap is now a measly 900m euros. OK, nearly £800m, but we're ""in the ball park,"" as one analyst told me. Defence ministers meet in Spain on Thursday, and it could happen that soon.

""I think there's a good chance that we can come to an agreement."" Tom Enders told the Financial Times on Friday. ""But you won't see me being enthusiastic. It would be good news for suppliers and employees, but financially and resources-wise it would remain a burden for years to come.""

Because this is a military plane, journalists are fond of battling metaphors. But in this deal, that misses the point. Although both sides want the other to pick up the bill, neither can afford a knock-out blow.

The nations buying the plane need Airbus. Some 10,000 jobs directly depend on the A400M programme across Europe. Former Royal Navy logistics officer Derek Forsyth, now with Sula Aerospace of Stroud, put it like this. ""There would be too much damage to the industries of the UK, Germany, France, if it were stopped - and the reputation of Airbus would be trashed.""

And Airbus, of course, needs the countries. There aren't too many customers for military transport planes. I'm guessing the Pentagon isn't at the front of the queue. Yes, in time the plane will sell round the world, but Europe is the home market. So this is the only deal in town.

While they haggle, Filton is holding its breath. As ever they make the wings here, and when they rolled out the first completed aircraft, I went with dozens of staff on a special flight from Filton to Seville. When the plane finally took to the air last December, all 800 on the project here stopped work to watch, and applaud.

But don't expect them to crack open the champers when a deal is struck.

Yes, Filton's teams and the thousands of other engineers across Europe will get on with making these astonishing aircraft. But Airbus will still be left with a bill of between three and four billion euros. The numbers are staggering, and I can't help worrying that aerospace workers across Europe will end up paying for it.

But the final surprise in this tale is this. A 3bn euro overspend is, well, OK actually.

""It's a big hit, yes, it's a big charge against the company's finances,"" Professor Lawrence tells me, ""but it's one Airbus can recover from. The aerospace recession has not been as bad as feared, and the civilian planes are selling well. It's not ideal, but this is a huge programme, and Airbus can take the hit.""

The 700-seat Jetstar Airbus A380 is coming - Crikey,"Fri, 19 Feb 2010 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyaWtleS5jb20uYXUvMjAxMC8wMi8xOS90aGUtNzAwLXNlYXQtamV0c3Rhci1haXJidXMtYTM4MC1pcy1jb21pbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Never mind the fate of first class seating on Qantas, which mesmerised the media this morning. Or the prospect of 550 seat Qantas A380s, which is 100 seats more than now.

The writing is on the terminal walls, or between the lines of the Qantas announcement yesterday of lousy returns from expensive fares, and a trebling of profits from Jetstar’s cheapies. The 650-700 seat Airbus A380 is coming, whether Jetstar does this for-and to-Qantas, or someone else does it.

Qantas has provided some apparently generic graphics of how A380 premium seats will be fitted inside the nine Boeing 747-400s it will keep in service until about 2020.

But the real issue from yesterday’s announcement of fewer first class seats, and more economy and premium economy seats, in the Qantas long haul fleet, is when Qantas will offer more than 600 seats in a Jetstar A380.

While the Qantas retrofit graphics don’t show with complete certainty how the revamp of the last Qantas 744s will work after first class is removed and the upgrade is completed, from late 2011, they beg this additional question, where will Jetstar REALLY fit in with the future of the airline in the light of yesterday’s reporting of the group’s first half to December 31 financial results?

Let’s look for a start at the new post first class configurations for the 744s and the changes being made to the A380s in the same late 2011-2013 interval.

The A380 style business class seats are obviously going to be put in the nose of the 747s where first class is today. But that will most likely only fit 16-18 of them, since the dimensions of the tapered nose of the 747 are unforgiving and Qantas CEO Alan Joyce broke the good news for all travellers yesterday that seat density, that is, legroom and other measures, will not be altered by the retrofits of the 744s or changes in the configurations of the A380s, including the six out of 20 already delivered.

The current 307 seat 744 cabins will be converted into 359 seats, 58 in business, 36 in premium economy and 265 in economy.

The image captioned simply ‘aisle wine service’ by Qantas shows the A380 style pods located upstairs if the roof line is any guide, but it may not be, and at most there is only room for 20 of them, under the Joyce declaration. So no matter what happens, some of those 58 business class seats will be in zone B, across the full width of the main deck of the 747-400, where the current product is seven across, with triple units, containing a middle seat. Middle seats aren’t all that popular in any class of cabin, but perhaps as with the current product, there will only be a small number of them.

The premium economy graphic however looks like it is upstairs too, as both images show the sloping cabin wall and the window locker line that is obvious in a 744 but can be found on the main deck of that type, for example in premium economy on British Airways jets, as a much thinner gap between the armrest and wall. (Where it acts as the perfect trap for small mislaid objects too.)

All 36 premium economy seats could be fitted in the 747 upper deck, but possibly not with quite as much seat pitch in some rows as found in the A380, which locates that class of service in a rather special feeling ‘club room ‘ at the rear of its top deck.

There is no graphic for how a reconfigured A380 will look either in the 490 seat ‘Pacific + some London flights model’ which will retain 14 first class suites but reduce business class to expand premium economy, or the high capacity 550 seat version, which will have no first class, and less business class seating but more economy and premium economy seats.

One guess would be that on the 550 seat version Qantas would shift premium economy to the forward zone of the main deck of the A380, since it is so wide that it would only make economic sense for business class to be there if it was arranged seven across, and that brings up the middle seat issue. This would in turn imply that economy class would continue into the rear of the top deck, where premium economy is found now on the four class Qantas A380s, which is also where Singapore Airlines puts extra economy seats today, and where Emirates puts a premium passenger bar .

These are just guesses. Who knows what feats of cramming are being accomplished in the Qantas comfort laboratories! At least Joyce’s promise rules out the prospect of 11 across seating in economy on the main deck of the A380. But not of course from a Jetstar A380 when that comes along.

Let’s think carefully about this. A 550 seat A380 is going to deeply undercut the per seat kilometre operating costs of a Boeing 777-300ER, its nearest cost efficient competitor at this moment, especially where some operators have already stuffed their customers into a 10 abreast format which is equivalent in terms of acute discomfort to 8 across in an A340/A330 until a coma sets in after about three hours.

And Jetstar is ‘murdering’ Qantas in terms of growth and contribution to profits as the demand for air travel, corporate accounts included, opts for lowest fare of the day. On medium haul international routes, Jetstar’s version of premium economy, Star Class, is also ultra competitive against the Qantas premium economy offering-not identical, but ultra competitive.

The issue must be that either Qantas deploys Jetstar A380s in a two class configuration on the longer as well as medium range routes in the next 4-5 years in order to be the price leader in the mass market with cost advantages that not even a 550 seat A380 can provide, or someone else does it, to them.

This situation is compounded by the unpalatable reality that the Boeing 787-9, the stretched version that Qantas may eventually get around 2015, has had its wing span lopped to the same as the shorter range and lower capacity 787-8. Which means that at the passenger density Jetstar requires, the -9 Dreamliner ain’t going to be a non-stop to America jet, nor a one-stop jet to Europe, at least not in the first 4-5 years after the type is eventually introduced into service. The original role for the huge but recently trimmed Qantas group order for 787s is one it seems less likely than ever to fulfil in the next 10 years.

The 787-9 is going to be a more comfortable version of the Airbus A330-300, with bigger windows too. And that seems to be about all. Which is rather depressing after all the hoop-la of the past about ultra light high composite structures and a full volumetric payload over distances of 14,800 kilometres. (Yes, that was the original claim when the jet was ordered in 2005. ) So if Jetstar is ever going to win back for Qantas lost territory in Europe, and clean up on the US and Asia leisure markets the way it has begun to with great success in Japan, it will need something with very low per seat costs and the ability to fill all of them on flight stages of up to 15 hours.

This brings us to the prospect of advanced Boeing 777s, and that is a real chance, and advanced versions of the A380, which is unchallenged at the low cost high seat density end of the spectrum already."

One of five RAAF-designated KC-30As on order, the modified airliner transferred almost 30t of fuel from its centreline boom to a French air force Boeing E-3F airborne warning and control system aircraft during two test flights conducted from Airbus Military's Getafe site near Madrid.

""This is a significant milestone in the programme,"" says Antonio Caramazana, vice-president and head of Airbus Military Derivatives. ""The E-3 AWACS is a challenge because of its aerodynamics characteristics due to the large radome. The AWACS crew reported that the handling of the aircraft was very smooth during the refuelling operation."" This was conducted at an altitude of around 20,000ft [6,100m] and at 250kt [460km/h], says Airbus.

Australia plans to accept its first two KC-30As in the fourth quarter of this year, with initial clearances being sought to refuel Boeing F/A-18A fighters and other KC-30As. The other three should follow in 2011-12, says Todd Russell, Madrid-based project team leader for its Defence Materiel Organisation.

The RAAF also wants its new tankers to progressively support operations with the F/A-18F Super Hornet, BAE Systems Hawk 127 advanced jet trainer, Boeing C-17 strategic transport and 737-based Wedgetail airborne early warning and control system aircraft, and eventually with the Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, he says.

Challenges facing the service's introduction of the KC-30A include maintaining air-to-air refuelling skills after having retired its last Boeing 707 in June 2008, and using a boom for the first time, Russell told IQPC's Air Tankers and Aerial Refuelling conference in London on 25 January. A training lag also exists because simulators for the new type will not be delivered until the first quarter of 2011, he says.

Meanwhile, the RAAF is also ""having difficulties with defining the UARRSI [universal aerial refuelling receptacle slipway installation] clearance envelope,"" says Russell. Three of its aircraft are being equipped with boom-mounted instrumentation to support the work, he adds.

In addition to providing AAR services, Australia's KC-30As are also being configured to carry 272 passengers and below-deck freight.

Russell also told the conference that Australia is proposing the formation a joint user group for air forces equipped with Airbus-derivative tankers. This would enable the partners to share operational lessons and discuss maintenance, certification and technical issues. The forum could also lead to agreements to ""collaborate on software and hardware upgrades"", he believes.

The joint user group proposal is being made to other A330 MRTT buyers Saudi Arabia, the UK and the United Arab Emirates, and to A310 tanker operators Canada and Germany. The A330 is also a candidate to meet requirements in nations including France, India and the USA.

The new £10 million search plan, involving US and Norwegian ships, will cover 77O square miles of sea, said Jean-Paul Troadec, chief of the French air crash investigation agency BEA.

Victims' families welcomed the effort. John Clemes, whose brother was among the dead said it had ""raised our hopes.""

""Our one regret is that it took so long"" to resume searching that was halted last summer, he said.

Mr Troadec said the search site includes depths of up to 12,000 feet, and the new search will be jointly financed by Airbus and Air France.

The US Navy and the National Transportation Safety Board will help, along with accident experts from Britain, Germany, Russia and Brazil and private companies.

The lifespan of the so-called ""pingers"" attached to the black boxes is only about a month, but officials say submarines and boats equipped with sonar gear can find the wreckage from the Airbus 330 even without the signals.

The second and most recent search for the black boxes ended in August. Investigators have said that the crash was probably caused by a series of failures, but that they will not know definitively without the black boxes."
