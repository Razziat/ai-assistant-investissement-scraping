Airbus and Boeing on Different Paths on Battery - The New York Times,"Fri, 15 Feb 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTMvMDIvMTYvYnVzaW5lc3MvZ2xvYmFsL2FpcmJ1cy1hYmFuZG9ucy1wbGFuLXRvLXVzZS1jb250cm92ZXJzaWFsLWJhdHRlcmllcy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When it comes to the volatile new lithium-ion battery technology, Boeing and Airbus are heading in different directions.

Faced with the potential of a lengthy investigation into what caused batteries on two Boeing 787 jets to ignite or emit smoke last month, Airbus said Friday that it had dropped plans to use the technology on its forthcoming wide-body jet, the A350-XWB, to avoid possible delays in producing the planes. But Boeing, which has much more at stake, said later in the day that it would stick with the batteries, and the company is working with regulators to reduce risks even if the cause of the hazards is not clearly found.

All 50 of the 787s delivered so far were grounded in mid-January. And even though the problems have embarrassed Boeing and could cost it hundreds of millions of dollars, the company said Friday, “There’s nothing we’ve learned in the investigations that would lead us to a different decision regarding lithium-ion batteries.”

To some extent, Boeing’s bravado reflects a sense among battery experts that they have narrowed down the ways that the batteries, made by a Japanese company, GS Yuasa, could fail. That then increases the chances that a handful of changes may eventually provide enough assurance that the batteries would be safe to use.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9087978601455688}",neutral,0.9087978601455688,0
Mobile Brookley Aeroplex preparing for Airbus’ touch down in Alabama | Made in Alabama - Made In Alabama,"Sun, 24 Feb 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hZGVpbmFsYWJhbWEuY29tLzIwMTMvMDIvYnJvb2tsZXktcHJlcGFyaW4tZm9yLWFpcmJ1cy1hbGFiYW1hLWZhY2lsaXR5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“Our logistics in Mobile are world class,” said Bill Sisson, the former executive director of the Mobile Airport Authority (MAA), which operates the 1,650-acre Brookley complex. (MAA also operates Mobile Regional Airport, the city’s main air hub.)

Brookley, a former U.S. Air Force base at the tip of Mobile Bay that now operates as an industrial park and a cargo and corporate air field, boasts air, water, rail and interstate connections that made it attractive to Airbus as a manufacturing center.

For starters, there is Runway 14/32, a 9,618-foot long, 150-foot wide landing strip, capable of accommodating any aircraft in the world. Runway 18/36 at Brookley is 7,800 feet long and 150 feet wide.

The site is adjacent to the Port of Mobile, one of the nation’s busiest deepwater ports. Airbus says the location will enable it to deliver fully equipped aircraft sections from Europe via standard freight container ships. That will simplify transportation of oversize aircraft components to the manufacturing facility.

Brookley’s other infrastructure assets are substantial, and Airbus will use road and rail to receive parts from U.S. suppliers. CSX Railroad runs through Brookley and hubs with four other railroads at the nearby seaport terminal. Interstate 10, a major east-west artery, stands two miles away, with two exits to Brookley. Interstate 65, which runs north to Chicago, is a mere four miles away.

“It’s a pretty unique combination,” said Sisson, now the president of the Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce.

Brookley’s logistical advantages are attracting other companies as well. Start-up firm PowAir International plans to build a $95 million, 500-worker facility at the complex that produces wind turbines and components such as blades and towers. The firm has received tax abatements to advance the project.

Sisson said Brookley is making numerous preparations for Airbus Alabama and its ripple effects. Construction of the Airbus manufacturing facility will begin in the summer of 2013, and the company is scheduled to deliver the first Alabama-made passenger jet to a customer at Brookley in 2016. Two years later, Airbus will begin turning out as many as 50 planes annually.

MAA has engaged Economic and Planning Systems of Berkley, Calif., to update its strategic plan in wake of the Airbus announcement and to develop a set of architectural guidelines for future development. Infrastructure improvements outlined in Brookley’s master plan are being made. A technology assessment is under way to ensure that Brookley is fully prepared for Airbus’ tech-savvy suppliers.

Sisson expects several suppliers to set up shop at Brookley to directly serve Airbus’ Alabama plant. Service suppliers, like Safran Engineering Services, will do the same. Safran, a firm that performs wiring system services for major aviation companies, will establish a facility at Brookley with 50 workers making annual salaries around $70,000.

“The service providers will want to be at Brookley because they want to be near the mothership,” Sisson said.

Brookley already is home to aerospace and aviation companies. Airbus operates an engineering center at the site that performs work on the A350 WXB, the A380 and other Airbus aircraft. ST Aerospace Mobile, FedEx and Continental Motors are among the aviation-related tenants at Brookley. Other tenants are in logistics, manufacturing and various specialties.

The Airbus project is another chapter in Brookley’s aviation heritage. Founded in 1929 as Bates Field, Mobile’s municipal airport, it operated as a major Air Force base from the 1940s until the late 1960s. At its peak, more than 17,000 people worked there.

During World War II, the secret Norden bomb sights used by the Army Air Corps were fine-tuned and repaired at Brookley. After the war, the base was home to the C-74 Globemaster, the military’s largest transport plane. Brookley’s closure in 1969 was at the time the largest base shutdown in the nation’s history.

Sisson said the Airbus Alabama project puts the state and Mobile on “the global aerospace stage.”

“Obviously, it’s transformational because there are so few places in the world where large aircraft are assembled,” he said. “I don’t think any of us have an idea of how big this really is.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999747276306152}",neutral,0.9999747276306152,0
Airbus scraps lithium-ion batteries for its A350 jets - USA TODAY,"Fri, 15 Feb 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTMvMDIvMTUvYWlyYnVzLXNjcmFwcy1saXRoaXVtLWlvbi1iYXR0ZXJpZXMtZm9yLWl0cy1hMzUwLWpldHMvMTkyMjI0My_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus scraps lithium-ion batteries for its A350 jets

Battery problems that caused the grounding of Boeing's 787 Dreamliner fleet have led its European rival, Airbus, to switch to traditional batteries when it launches a similar aircraft next year.

That decision may give Airbus a slight temporary edge in competition against Boeing as the Dreamliner sits on the ground, at least one analyst says.

""Airbus would have a slight advantage in the marketplace'' because the A350 would likely have ""less glitches,"" says Oliver McGee, an aerospace engineer and a former deputy assistant Transportation secretary in the Clinton administration.

Airbus, whose A350 mirrors the Dreamliner in its billing as a more fuel-efficient jet of the future, says it is closely watching the investigation into incidents involving lithium-ion batteries on two of Boeing's 787s last month.

While it says it is confident that its own version of the battery is safe, Airbus has decided to use more standard batteries when the first A350s take flight in 2014.

""In the interest of keeping the A350 XWB program on track, and wanting to remove any concern of battery complications, Airbus has decided to stick with the proven, tested and already-in-successful-service nickel cadmium battery for the A350's entry into service,'' says Mary Anne Greczyn, spokeswoman for Airbus Americas.

Boeing's Dreamliner was launched to much fanfare as the world's first jet made mostly of carbon fiber rather than traditional aluminum and steel. But last month, the Federal Aviation Administration grounded all 787s after a smoldering battery forced a Dreamliner to make an emergency landing in Japan, and a battery fire erupted in a plane parked at Boston's Logan airport.

WHICH AIRLINES HAVE DREAMLINERS?: The answer, in photos

The National Transportation Safety Board is looking into what caused the battery to catch fire in Boston, and the Federal Aviation Administration is scrutinizing the jet's entire design, while focusing on the battery.

Boeing turned to the lithium-ion batteries to power the 787 because they're lighter and can store more energy than other types of batteries of an equivalent size. But they're also more likely to short circuit and start a fire than other batteries if they're damaged or have a flaw in manufacturing.

Richard Aboulafia, an airline analyst with the Teal Group, says switching batteries is an easier shift for Airbus than Boeing. The 787 is much further along in its development, he says, and has a structure that requires the kind of fast backup power that lithium-ion batteries provide.

The A350's design ""lends itself to an easier battery change,'' he says. ""Given all the uncertainty, (Airbus) probably figures that's the least risky way to go, especially since it won't require much disruption to their schedule at this point.''

It's unclear when the Dreamliner will be cleared to fly again, as investigators aren't yet certain what caused a battery fire on a plane that sat on the ground in Boston and caused another to smolder during a flight last month.

Airbus isn't dismissing use of the lithium batteries altogether.

Greczyn says Airbus will continue its testing of lithium-ion batteries ""for future aircraft programs,'' and will use them in test flights of the A350 as well.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7717041969299316}",positive,0.7717041969299316,1
A Good Week for the Airbus Military Tanker - Second Line of Defense - Second Line of Defense,"Wed, 27 Feb 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vc2xkaW5mby5jb20vMjAxMy8wMi9hLWdvb2Qtd2Vlay1mb3ItdGhlLWFpcmJ1cy1taWxpdGFyeS10YW5rZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"2013-02-27 It is a good week for the new A330MRTT tanker.

At the Australian airshow this week, the Royal Australian Air Force will highlight the tanker at the Avalon air show.

They have also declared the aircraft operational and have 5 aircraft in their fleet.

According to an Airbus Military press release dated February 26, 2013:

The Australian Department of Defence has declared Initial Operational Capability (IOC) of the Airbus Military KC-30A – its designation for the A330 MRTT. The announcement was made on the opening day of the Australian International Airshow, Avalon, by Minister for Defence Stephen Smith (pictured above) and Minister for Defence Materiel Mike Kelly. The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) accepted the fifth and final MRTT from Airbus Military on 30 November last year. The aircraft was delivered to RAAF Base Amberley in early December 2012. As well, the RAAF completed the first Australian pilot and Air Refuelling Operator courses at the MRTT training centre (RAAF Base Amberley) in December 2012.

Separately, another global customer has added an operational A330MRTT tanker to its fleet. In a location far from Australia, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has its first new tanker.

In an Airbus Military press release dated February 27, 2013:

The Royal Saudi Air Force has formally inducted into service the Airbus Military A330 MRTT new generation tanker/transport aircraft. Deputy Minister of Defense Prince Khaled bin Sultan dedicated the aircraft at a ceremony at Riyadh Airbase on 25 February. The aircraft is the first of a batch of three that have now been contractually delivered. Deliveries of a second batch of three which were subsequently ordered will begin at the end of 2014. They will be used to refuel RSAF fighters including the F-15, Typhoon and Tornado. A330 MRTTs have now been delivered to all four current customers – Australia, Saudi Arabia, UAE and UK.

Although far away from each other’s deployments, the two tankers illustrate two key contributions which the tankers can be expected to make to their respective air forces.

For the Aussies, the “tyranny of distance” of the Pacific can be better managed by its air assets and those of its coalition partners with their refueable, long distance tanker.

For the Saudis, the narrow band of air bases on their territory will receive a significant boost in range with a flying air base over their fighters allowing them to redeploy in the region or better support coalition forces operating with them.

Distance and providing an expanded operational air space are two core contributions of a next generation tanker.

The two are connected in another way as well. Common with fleet wide aircraft, user groups can work together to share operational experience and to provide the basis for domain knowledge guiding the upgrade process.

Airbus Military has such a user group — the MRTT user group — which includes A310 MRTT users such as Canada with those flying the newest tanker, the A330MRTT.

According to a 2011 report on a meeting of the MRTT user group:

The Airbus MRTT User Group (AMUG) 2011 Conference was held on September 14th-15th in Getafe, Spain, where the Airbus A330 MRTT conversion center and design office are located. Delegates from six different nations (four A330 MRTT customers plus two observer states), gathered to exchange experiences and share best practice. During the conference, Airbus Military presented several technical briefings centred on potential future developments for the A330 MRTT and the conclusions of the last A330/A340 safety symposium. The represented nations shared their experience as MRTT users, such as the A310 MRTT performance in the Libyan campaign, where two aircraft were deployed at Trapani for Operation Mobile, transferring more than 10 million pounds of fuel to a variety of allied receivers (F-18, Rafale, Super-Étendard, Tornado) in 250 sorties. The A310 MRTT was well endorsed by all the NATO receiver community.

And in a report on the 2012 MRTT user group meeting, the evolution of the group’s agenda was noted.

The 2nd annual meeting of the Airbus MRTT Users Group (AMUG) was held on 26 and 27 September in Getafe, Spain with significant attendance from the users and 50 representatives. A key part of the meeting was the presentation of the national reports from each customer with details of their operations and issues. Airbus Military presented several topics of interest including new developments within the MRTT system, the military parts pool, ARO training evolution, details on the MRTT Electronic Flight Bag, and A330 MRTT product development.

Airbus announced yesterday it secured an order of 25 A350 XWB planes, from Los Angeles-based Air Lease Corporation (ALC).

The A350 family of planes is designed to compete with the Boeing 777, its rival's most popular plane. Still in development, the A350 XWB will be ready for its maiden flight later this year, according to Airbus.

ALC's order is a relief after the French manufacturer did not deliver any A380s in January, according to Aviation Week.

In October, the French planemaker began working to speed up production of the A350s, putting $15 billion into an assembly factory in Toulouse, France. Boeing has sped up its assembly process as well, now building eight new planes each week.

But the outcome of the investigation into the lithium-ion battery that powers Boeing's grounded Dreamliner could become a setback for Airbus, which plans to use lithium-ion batteries in the A350.

That investigation is moving forward slowly. Japanese officials have determined a fire in one jet was caused by a build up of heat, called thermal runaway, which badly damaged the lithium-ion battery. The cause of the high temperature is still unknown.

""Airbus will carefully study recommendations that come out of the 787 investigation and evaluate whether they apply to the A350,"" Airbus spokesman Stefan Schaffrath said in January.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9978318810462952}",neutral,0.9978318810462952,0

ALC also has options for five additional A350-1000s. With this new order, ALC becomes the 35th A350 XWB customer and the order takes the A350 XWB backlog past 600 (to 617).

Concurrently, ALC has signed a purchase order for 14 A321neo aircraft following an earlier agreement announced at the 2012 Farnborough International Air Show for 36 A320neo Family aircraft plus 14 options. With this latest confirmation from ALC, the lessor’s cumulative orders for the A320neo Family have reached 50, of which up to 34 will be A321neo models. ALC will announce engine selections at a later date.

The A350 XWB Family is becoming the industry benchmark for efficiency in the long haul segment, and the A320neo Family is ideal for airlines operating short to medium haul missions. These aircraft will help airlines grow their businesses while simultaneously reducing their operating costs and emissions, said Steven F. Udvar-Házy, Air Lease Corporation’s chairman and chief executive officer. ALC offers its customers the most modern, efficient aircraft on the market, and both the A350 XWB and the NEO fit right in that category.

ALC’s continued confidence in Airbus products and especially our fuel efficient A350 XWB and A320neo Families is a great indicator of the long-term success of these aircraft, said John Leahy, Airbus chief operating officer, Customers.

The A350 XWB (Xtra Wide-Body) is an all-new mid-size long range product line comprising three versions and seating between 270 and 350 passengers in typical three-class layouts. The new family will bring a step change in efficiency compared with existing aircraft in this size category, using 25 per cent less fuel and providing an equivalent reduction in CO2 emissions. Scheduled for entry-into-service in 2014, with ALC’s newest order included, the A350 XWB has already won 617 firm orders from 35 customers worldwide.

The A320neo will enter into service in late 2015, followed by the A321neo in 2016. The A320neo Family incorporates latest generation engines and large Sharklet wing-tip devices, which together will deliver up to 15 percent in fuel savings which is equivalent to 1.4 million litres of fuel – the consumption of 1,000 mid size cars, saving 3,600 tons of CO2 per aircraft per year.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9936582446098328}",neutral,0.9936582446098328,0
Brookley Aeroplex positioning itself at epicenter of Mobile's expanding international economy - AL.com,"Tue, 19 Feb 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsLmNvbS9saXZlLzIwMTMvMDIvYnJvb2tsZXlfYWVyb3BsZXhfcG9zaXRpb25pbmcuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MOBILE, Alabama – With groundbreaking on a $600 million Airbus plant barely two months away, Mobile's Brookley Aeroplex is in full preparation mode for its newest tenant and the chain reaction of aerospace activity the aircraft assembly plant is expected to spawn.

Bill Sisson, executive director of the Mobile Airport Authority, said the former U.S. Air Force base currently boasts about 160 acres available for development plus roughly 80 acres of existing structures that – with proper planning – can be repurposed for more efficient use.

“The economy in Mobile is very global, and Brookley is at the epicenter of that. There’s just a lot of potential for international development that includes not only Airbus and its suppliers such as Safran Engineering but longtime partners such as Continental Motors and ST Aerospace Mobile,” Sisson said.

The University of South Alabama’s Center for Real Estate and Economic Development estimates total new earnings from all direct and indirect jobs associated with the top 12 international companies currently operating in Mobile and Washington counties at slightly more than $2 billion annually with an overall economic earnings impact of $4.56 billion.

Airbus North America Engineering, ranking 12th on the list, already employs 240 directly at its Brookley Aeroplex facility, accounting for 285 indirect jobs and total annual economic impact of $45 million.

Meanwhile, Continental Motors ranks eighth with 400 direct jobs, 800 indirect jobs and overall economic impact of nearly $141 million, while third-ranked ST Aerospace employs 1,500 directly, 3.001 indirectly and generates overall economic impact of slightly more than $528 million.

Sisson contends continued careful, long-term planning will allow the airport authority to attract an even stronger, more diversified tenant base than Brookley already houses, including more than 70 companies employing more than 3,200 in the sectors of aviation and aerospace, manufacturing and logistics and distribution.

Specifically, Brookley adheres to a master plan crafted by Economic & Planning Systems Inc., an urban planning firm based in Berkeley, Calif., that lists the Port of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Los Angeles International Airport among its clients.

The land economics consulting firm completed its last 40-year master plan for Brookley in 2004, but revisited the property and its needs in 2006 when Mobile was vying for the U.S. tanker bid through Airbus parent company EADS.

“And they were here again in early December to help us re-examine everything related to Airbus project,” Sisson said.

Although he acknowledges repurposing a World War II-era military base can be challenging in this process, the “pros far outweigh the cons.”

“We have the challenges of re-use here, but the age of some of the buildings is really the only con,” Sisson said. “The existing infrastructure is what makes us incredibly fortunate. That infrastructure might need to be upgraded, but it’s here, and that alone is huge compared with starting from scratch.”

In turn, the aeroplex’s long-range plan is in place – and executed on an almost daily basis – to help update existing structures and infrastructure while coordinating plans for growth.

Those plans include execution of a comprehensive landscaping guidelines plan, developing an architectural guideline plan and devising a technological guideline plan, necessary to ensure sufficient fiber and wifi capabilities exist throughout the complex addressing the complex’s current “limited connectivity.”

And with an annual operating budget hovering around $4 million, Sisson said the Airport Authority’s available funds limit the pace of growth, but the substantial diversification of tenants has increased total revenue at least 20 percent during the past four years.

“We’re counting on our partners to do what they’re doing, and we’re counting on additional tenants joining the mix and the revenue they’ll bring in,” Sisson said, noting the authority, which also oversees the 3,000 acres at Mobile Regional Airport, has no intentions of acting as a developer for Brookley.

“We are listening to and meeting with interested developers, but that is not a role the authority wishes to shoulder,” Sisson said.

Speaking in Singapore, Airbus's chief operating officer for customers, John Leahy, said the region will require 9,890 new aircraft out to 2031, valued at $1.6 trillion.

That figure comprises 6,030 narrowbody, 3,080 twin-aisle and 760 high-capacity aircraft - those with more than 400 seats. The latter market represents 45% of deliveries for such aircraft, Airbus says.

""The Asia-Pacific market is where the action will be in the air transport market over the next 20 years,"" says Leahy. ""Growing economies, bigger cities and increasing wealth will see more people flying, driving the need for larger and more efficient aircraft.""

Leahy also highlights the role of low-cost carriers, noting that the number of routes served by them in Asia has grown six-fold over the last 10 years.

""I can remember about 15-20 years ago coming out to Asia-Pacific and it was generally understood that the low-cost model wouldn't work in Asia. Everybody got that wrong,"" he says.

Airbus also predicts demand for 251 new-build freighters which, in addtition to 320 converted aircraft, will take the region's fleet of freighters from 316 today to 887 by 2031.

Airbus to drop lithium-ion batteries in A350 - USA TODAY,"Thu, 14 Feb 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90cmF2ZWwvZmxpZ2h0cy8yMDEzLzAyLzE0L2FpcmJ1cy1saXRoaXVtLWJhdHRlcmllcy8xOTIxNzc1L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus to drop lithium-ion batteries in A350

NEW YORK (AP) — Airbus said Thursday it is dropping lithium-ion batteries from its new A350 airplane because of uncertainty surrounding the technology that has led to the grounding of Boeing's 787.

The European planemaker said it has decided to revert to conventional nickel-cadmium batteries for the A350. The plane is a wide-body long-range jet rival to the 787 and is expected to make its first flight around the middle of the year.

Airbus says it does not expect the battery switch to lead to a setback in the A350's schedule.

""Airbus considers this to be the most appropriate way forward in the interest of program execution and A350 XWB reliability,"" spokeswoman Mary Anne Greczyn said.

Federal officials grounded the 787 last month because of problems with its lithium-ion batteries that caused one fire and forced another plane to make an emergency landing.

Airbus noted the A350 uses batteries in a different setup than the 787, making it unlikely that it would face the same problems. Its A350 flight-test program would still go forward with lithium-ion batteries.

But because the causes of the problems with the 787 batteries remain unclear, Airbus decided to make the switch ""to optimize program certainty,"" Greczyn said. Airbus is a unit of Netherlands-based EADS NV.

The Wall Street Journal first reported on Airbus' decision to drop the lithium-ion batteries, noting the incidents with the 787 have led to industry uncertainty about future safety standards for the technology.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.999737560749054}",negative,0.999737560749054,-1
New A380-only concourse opens at Dubai airport - USA TODAY,"Mon, 11 Feb 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS90b2RheWludGhlc2t5LzIwMTMvMDIvMTEvbmV3LWEzODAtY29uY291cnNlLW9wZW5zLWF0LWR1YmFpLWFpcnBvcnQvMTkwOTcwNS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"New A380-only concourse opens at Dubai airport

Dubai's airport authorities say an entire concourse built specifically to handle Airbus' A380 aircraft is now fully open after about a month of phased-in operations.

The A380, of course, is the world's largest commercial passenger airline jet — a double-decked giant capable of seating more than 500 customers in a typical seat layout. An all-coach configuration could hold up to 200 or 300 more.

Emirates is the world's biggest customer for Airbus' A380, with 31 currently in its fleet and another 59 on order.

""The full opening of Concourse A is a significant milestone and achievement in supporting and enabling the continued growth of Emirates,"" Emirates president Tim Clark is quoted as saying by Travel Weekly. ""Emirates is the largest operator of this aircraft in the world and it is only fitting that we have a world class facility that meets this need and represents our leadership in this regard.""

The 20-gate concourse hosted its first flight on Jan. 2, the beginning of efforts to phase in the facility. The project is part of a broader $7.8 billion expansion effort by Dubai's international airport.

The 11-story, A380-focused Concourse A is connected to Emirates Terminal 3 via an underground train. From Concourse A, Emirates now flies its A380s to 21 destinations. Qantas also will shift its London A380 flights to the Dubai Concourse A, part of its new partnership with Emirates that will have the Australian carrier shift its ""Kangaroo route"" stop from Singapore to Dubai.

Emirates claims that its new facility ""features the biggest Business-Class lounge in the world"" as well as a first-class lounge.

The Associated Press notes ""the new concourse, formally unveiled Sunday, is also a boost for the European Airbus consortium in its rivalry with Boeing, whose 787 has been grounded since mid-January as investigators examine possible problems in its lithium ion batteries.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9983893632888794}",neutral,0.9983893632888794,0
JetBlue Bends Their A320 Wings For Fuel Savings - Airline Reporter,"Thu, 21 Feb 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMy8wMi9qZXRibHVlLWJlbmRzLXRoZWlyLWEzMjAtd2luZ3MtZm9yLWZ1ZWwtc2F2aW5ncy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"How does an airline burn less fuel, and make their aircraft look cooler in the process? The answer is simple: Winglets. Actually, in this case, sharklets. In late 2012, Airbus finally delivered their first A320 with blended winglets to AirAsia, which they have affectionately named a sharklet. Sharklets promise a reduced fuel burn of up to 3.5 percent, which leads to less CO 2 emissions and greater profits air airlines.

New York based JetBlue is the first North American airline to sport sharklets, and is also the first airline worldwide to retrofit a production A320 with sharklets. The retrofit was completed by in-house technicians at the airlines John F. Kennedy Airport maintenance hanger. At an event Wednesday, JetBlue and Airbus were proud to show it off.

“I’m excited,” said Mark Powers, JetBlue Chief Financial Officer. “But I’m not excited that when the plane flies to San Francisco, its going to save us $568.75. No, no, I’m not excited about that. Nor am I excited about the fact that this airplane will save, conservatively, $350,000 a year. Nah, that doesn’t excite me either. And actually, once the whole fleet is retro fitted, were going to save $45 million a year, but that doesn’t excite me either. What really excites me, this airplane looks really cool. Winglets complete this aircraft.”

The first retrofit was completed quicker than expected, returning the aircraft to revenue service early. JetBlue plans to retrofit several A320s this year, but the entire fleet is not expected to be converted for several years. Older airframes will takes up to three weeks to be retrofitted, due to the wings requiring strengthening. Newer airframes will only require a few days to complete the process. All new A320 and A321 deliveries will include sharklets.

UPDATE: First Flight

Although no test flight was announced, N821JB did indeed take to the skies on Friday for a test flight. Here are some pictures at it departs JFK over my house.

"Airbus parent EADS sees Q4 earnings fall on charges at helicopter, defence units - Canadian Metalworking","Wed, 27 Feb 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYW5hZGlhbm1ldGFsd29ya2luZy5jb20vY2FuYWRpYW5tZXRhbHdvcmtpbmcvbmV3cy9hdXRvbWF0aW9uc29mdHdhcmUvYWlyYnVzLXBhcmVudC1lYWRzLXNlZXMtcTQtZWFybmluZ3MtZmFsbC1vbi1jaGFyZ2VzLWF0LWhlbGljb3B0ZXItZGVmZW5jZS11bml0c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"BERLIN -- Airbus parent company EADS NV posted a 47 per cent drop in fourth-quarter net profit Wednesday after taking costly charges at its helicopter and defence electronics divisions.

The aerospace giant recorded a €325 million net profit in the October-December period, down from the previous year's €612 million. But for the full year, its net earnings were up 19 per cent at €1.23 billion from €1.03 billion in 2011.

""There's still some way to go to meet our profitability targets,"" said chief executive Tom Enders.

Revenues rose 17 per cent during the fourth quarter to €19.22 billion, with the core Airbus division posting a 21 per cent increase to almost €13 billion.

But EADS took a €198 million hit during the quarter at its defence electronics contractor Cassidian, in part reflecting restructuring costs.

Renegotiating contracts with government customers resulted in a €100 million charge at helicopter maker Eurocopter.

The company's core business, aircraft maker Airbus, posted a 36 per cent increase in operating profit during the final three months, rising to €393 million from €289 million in 2011. Of that, orders for civilian aircraft brought in €309 million while military planes garnered €85 million during the quarter.

Spaceflight division Astrium reported operating profits of €121 million, an increase of 19 per cent from €102 million in the same period the previous year.

EADS said it expects to sell more commercial aircraft - about 700 - in 2013. Revenues will grow modestly, it said, but results will be affected by stuttering sales of the giant A380, which has suffered problems with its wings.

""We would love to sell more of the big birds,"" said Enders. ""We need to sell more, and we will.""

Another headache for Airbus are the production delays for its new A350 Extra Wide Body model - intended to challenge Boeing's 787 ""Dreamliner."" The 787 program has itself run into difficulties with the entire fleet grounded due to problems with its lithium batteries. Enders was diplomatic about his rival's woes, saying there was ""definitely no schadenfreude"" about the 787's grounding.

In its earnings report EADS repeated its warning that the A350 XWB program ""remains challenging.""

""Any schedule change could lead to increasingly higher impact on provisions,"" the company said.

EADS also said it was pushing back delivery of the first A400 M military transport planes from the first to the second quarter of the year.

With defence spending being cut in many industrialized countries, Enders said EADS was satisfied with the current share of defence in its business.

""Maybe it's not a bad time to have a smaller rather than larger defence business,"" he told reporters in Berlin, adding that the company planned to look forward after its failed bid to merge with Britain's BAE Systems last year.

Investors had also expected to receive an update Wednesday on the company's internal probe into allegations of bribery in the sale of fighter jets to Austria.

Enders said the results of the investigation - which runs parallel to a probe by Austrian authorities - would be presented at a later date as its scope had been widened.

""It's too early to jump to any conclusions,'' he said. But the company isn't currently making any provisions for legal repercussions in the case. ""I have no reason to assume that employees of the company have engaged in misconduct or any criminal behaviour.''

The company said it is inviting shareholders to an extraordinary meeting March 27 to approve its new governance structure and a share buyback program for up to 15 per cent of its stock. EADS last year announced sweeping governance changes that will see influence by state shareholders France and Germany shrink.

The company board is proposing a €0.60 increase in dividend at its annual general meeting in June.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9999459981918335}",negative,0.9999459981918335,-1
Dreamliner rival ditches controversial batteries - CNN,"Fri, 15 Feb 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAxMy8wMi8xNS9uZXdzL2FpcmJ1cy1kcmVhbWxpbmVyLWJhdHRlcnkvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"London CNNMoney —

European planemaker Airbus has dropped plans to use lithium-ion batteries in its new A350 passenger jet, after a series of electrical faults forced Boeing to ground its entire fleet of Dreamliners.

Investigators have yet to determine the primary cause of the lithium-ion battery problems on Boeing (BA)’s 787 Dreamliner, but Airbus said Friday it was playing it safe to avoid any delay in deliveries to customers. Instead it would install traditional and slightly heavier nickel-cadmium batteries.

“With so much uncertainty raised by the 787 investigation, we are being prudent in order to protect our program schedule,” said Airbus spokesman Justin Dubon.

The company, owned by European aerospace group EADS (EADSF), said it would continue to develop lithium-ion battery technology while it waits for the findings of the Federal Aviation Administration investigation into the Dreamliner faults.

Related: Boeing wants to test 787 Dreamliner in flight

Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier told CNN last month he was taking personal charge of ensuring the success of the A350, and that there was plenty of time to respond to the findings of the Dreamliner probe.

The A350 is Airbus’ response to Boeing’s light-weight plane and is due to make its first test flight in the middle of this year. The first commercial delivery is due in the second half of 2014, to Qatar Airways.

Airbus has 592 orders so far for its A350 family, which ranges in price from $254 million to $332 million.

Related: Dreamliner woes won’t hit earnings, says Boeing

Boeing, which last year overtook Airbus to become the world’s biggest aircraft maker for the first time in a decade, is continuing to build Dreamliners at a rate of about five jets per month. However, the planemaker has warned at least two airlines that deliveries could be delayed.

Boeing is already facing compensation claims from existing customers, but the financial cost of any major change in the design or build of the Dreamliner would be much more significant.

So far, 58 customers around the world have ordered 848 of the $200 million Boeing jet. The Dreamliner is particularly attractive to customers in the Middle East and Asia that depend on long-range flights for much of their business, and are keen for any improvement in fuel-economy that a lighter-weight plane could offer.

Zurich Airport and Skyguide Select Airbus ProSky to Optimise ILS Protection Areas - ATC Network,"Tue, 12 Feb 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF0Yy1uZXR3b3JrLmNvbS9hdGMtbmV3cy96dXJpY2gtYWlycG9ydC1hbmQtc2t5Z3VpZGUtc2VsZWN0LWFpcmJ1cy1wcm9za3ktdG8tb3B0aW1pc2UtaWxzLXByb3RlY3Rpb24tYXJlYXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus ProSky, the Airbus Air Traffic Management (ATM) subsidiary, was selected by Zurich Airport and Swiss Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP) Skyguide, to optimise the Instrument Landing System (ILS) protection areas of one of the airport's three runways.

Zurich Airport and Skyguide have selected ELISE services (Exact Landing Interference Simulation Environment) as the best solution to precisely simulate and optimize the critical and sensitive areas of the new localizer antenna for A380 and 747 operations for its ICAO CATIII runway.The analysis will also assess the possible gains in terms of size of protection areas by using different localizer antenna systems.

Mr Jann Döbelin, Head of Planning and Engineering at Zurich Airport states: ""The smaller the protection areas are, the less limitations applies to runway capacity, which is key for any large airports."" Mr. Hervé Demule, Head of ILS Product Center at Skyguide adds: ""We expect that the results delivered by ELISE will bring Cat III Holding Points closer to the runway and reduce the Runway Occupancy Time in Low Visibility, thus adding additional capacity.""

ELISE services were initially developed by the Airbus business nursery from the expertise of Airbus Engineering, EADS Innovation Works and ENAC (the French Aeronautic University). Airbus ProSky is now developing the services as part of their integrated ATM portfolio. ELISE services offer a change in accuracy and reliability on localizer and glide path signal predictions compared to existing tools, by modelling the airport environment in 3D.

""We are very proud that the value brought by our software is recognized by the expert community,"" says Charles Champion, Head of Engineering at Airbus. ""The results from ELISE software are being used by ICAO in charge of updating the ICAO Annex 10 - Radio Navigation Aids. ELISE results are indeed promising when you acknowledge that it can be used to assess the impact on the ILS signal of any obstacle like an aircraft, a crane or a new terminal.""

Expansion projects for new building become more and more critical, because of the lack of available space and the cost of acquiring new fields. ELISE service will allow the best use of the terrain close to the runway with a stealthy innovative facade developed by EADS (mother company of Airbus) Innovation Works' division. This customized stealthy facade removes the disturbances caused by the building on the localizer signal, which allows the delivery of construction permits for large and high buildings in close proximity to the runway. Airbus has already used this technology for the new A350 XWB final assembly line building in Toulouse constructed in 2012, adjacent to the main airport. Airbus ProSky will now propose this validated technology to worldwide land-constrained airports","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9868165850639343}",neutral,0.9868165850639343,0

On top of that, two cancellations of ACJ318s, caused by the airframer undertaking ""housekeeping"" on its orderbook, took the net figure down to only three aircraft.

The division is pinning its hopes for 2013 on an improved market, including several ongoing governmental campaigns. François Chazelle, ACJ vice-president, says the contests offer potential for sales right across its range. He says: ""It's mostly at the smaller end, but I could imagine some appetite coming back for widebodies too.""

Airbus

Additionally, ACJ intends to bolster its widebody sales through the disposal of a number of former Singapore Airlines A340-500 passenger jets, which are returning to Airbus as part of a deal for new A350s. In all, Airbus will receive five of the A340s from the carrier and Chazelle is confident the corporate jet operation will be able to move some of them on. However, its ability to sell all five aircraft is constrained by capacity later this year at completions centres, he says.

To support the sale of the A340s, the division has developed a new three-class interior for the type. Called ""Gala"", it offers a VVIP cabin between doors two and three, with potential to install first-class seating at the front and a business-class section to the rear.

""It's something we have asked the outfitters to quote on and we believe we have come up with quite an attractive package and price,"" he says. The Gala concept will also be available for new-build ACJ330s and the conversion of existing commercial A330s.

Further down its range, Chazelle remains confident its ""entry-level"" ACJ318 will continue to attract interest, particularly with the Enhanced package, including the addition of the sharklet wing-tip modification, which it launched at the NBAA show in 2012.

Although there has been no decision on the future of the ACJ318 following its exclusion from Airbus's re-engining plans for commercial A320-family jets, Chazelle says production will continue at least until 2018-2019 despite the overall transition to assembly of the Neo range from 2015. ""There's no real obstacle to build the two in parallel,"" he says.

There is also no indication yet whether Airbus will offer re-engined variants of the ACJ320 family.

In 2012, ACJ booked orders for two ACJ318s, two ACJ319s and a single ACJ330, handing over nine aircraft in total.

In a move that many have found questionable, Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Al Saud, the 15th richest person in the world, has sold his A380 jet plane, which he bought in 2007. The proceeds from the sale have been utilized to further his investments in Saudi Arabia and the greater the Middle East. The prince boasts of a net worth of $29 billion, and his fortune has surged $8.5 billion since April 2012 as Kingdom shares have almost doubled in value. One can only wonder why he needed to rid himself of his opulent ‘flying palace’ to fuel his business development plans.





Alwaleed Bin Talal Al Saud’s 239-feet long France-based Airbus SAS manufactured by Toulouse boasts a list price of $319 million at the time of purchase in 2007 and can accommodate 853 passengers. Alwaleed has built much of his fortune investing in companies such as Apple Inc. And News Corp, but the past few years have seen him shifting his focus to the Middle East.

TENGKU BAHAR/AFP/Getty Images An Air Asia Airbus A320 lands while Air Asia aircraft are seen parked on the tarmac at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport, March 13, 2007.

If you’re an experienced business traveler, the last thing you want to hear after cramming yourself into a small seat on an overnight flight is a child’s screaming.

Now one more airline has officially launched a solution for those who want to stay away from kids on flights. Air Asia X, the long-haul branch of budget carrier Air Asia, is offering a child-free seating zone on some of its flights. Beginning this week, kids younger than 12 are “strictly off-limits” in the first seven rows of the economy class on the company’s flights to China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Australia and Nepal, CNN reported.

According to the carrier’s website, passengers can choose to sit in this ‘Quiet Zone’, which also features special ambience lighting, for the standard seat-selection fee of $11-$35.

(More: Malaysia Airlines to Offer Child-Free Zone on Flights)

Air Asia isn’t the first airline to institute an adults-only section on its flights; competitor Malaysia Airlines announced in April 2012 that it would ban all under-12s from the upper-level economy deck in its Airbus A380-800 on the Kuala Lumpur-to-London route.

But while Air Asia says that its child-free zone is for those in search of some “peace of mind,” others call the move discrimination against families who pay for their tickets.

Simon Calder, travel editor of The Independent, told the BBC that he believed people who hate flying with children nearby just need to get over it.

“I very, very much think that people need to be tolerant,” he said. “If they don’t like it, I have two words for them- ear plugs. We are living in the 21st century where people have iPods.”

A quick re-cap on what a Sharklet first though – It’s a device on the end of a wing that increases the lift generated at the wingtip, whilst reducing the educe the lift-induced drag caused by wingtip vortices, leading to better performance of an aircraft in terms of fuel weight and range.

Now we have the science bit out of the way, lets get onto the pretty pictures.

And finally, the third carrier to recive their Sharklet A320’s will be JetBlue, who are rather chuffed to have these aircraft – as the extra range they offer. More importantly, JetBlue’s aircraft will have their sharklets fitted as a extra option post delivery so their fleet can be outfitted with them, as some of JetBlue’s fleet has the structural re-enforcement to take the Sharklets.

JetBlue intend to have their A320 fleet fitted with Sharklets by 2017.

In terms of range, it will allow JetBlue to eliminate technical stops on certain transcontinental routes when flying into strong headwinds, so JFK to Oakland, Boston to Los Angeles should be non stop.

Go Air and Avianca have also reicived Sharklet equiped A320’s too

The C295, is in widespread service as both transport and maritime patrol versions, as well as Coast Guard and anti-pollution control…

Not only has the capability of such machines dramatically improved since the days of the Avro, but mature designs already proven in service such as the Airbus Military C295 continue to be developed for the future. With a commitment to innovation, it seems it is always possible to “squeeze a little more juice from the orange”.

This is achieved partly thanks to the concept of rapid prototyping, an agile development process which enables new concepts to be tested for their cost-effectiveness and either selected for further work or discarded in a relatively short period. The result is that as well as improving the basic design of the transport version, it is possible to generate entirely new versions to respond to the market, and that in turn enables nations such as India to exploit the cost-advantages of using the same basic design in different roles.

The C295, for example, is in widespread service as both transport and maritime patrol versions, as well as Coast Guard and anti-pollution control, but it was then developed into an anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft which is in operational service in Chile and now an airborne early warning (AEW) derivative is being actively offered. In some cases, notably Portugal, the same aircraft are switched between surveillance and transport versions by use of roll-on/roll-off palletized mission systems. The same concept is employed by the US Coast Guard and the C295’s smaller brother – the CN235.

Additionally the basic C295 transport continues to benefit from new features. Following flight-testing, the aircraft will very shortly be certified to use higher power ratings. This enhancement is being applied to the aircraft’s existing Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127 engines and will allow pilots to use the additional power at their discretion when it would be advantageous. The extra boost provides improved climb and ceiling performance or can be translated into additional payload – as much as 1,700kg more than currently at 25,000ft. Airbus Military Head of Engineering Miguel Angel Morell says: “This improves operation over very high terrain such as the Himalayas with only minor influence on power plant maintenance costs.”

Rapid prototyping techniques were also important in the ongoing development of an aerodynamic enhancement to the C295 – the provision of winglets, which are currently being tested on the prototype aircraft. That aircraft is still fitted with the dummy radar rotodome used in the development trials of the C295 AEW variant for which the winglets may be particularly valuable. But the devices also promise benefits for the transport variant by improving take-off performance as well as in the climb and cruise by increasing the lift to drag ratio. Windtunnel testing indicated that the advantages would outweigh the increased weight and the aircraft first flew with the winglets in December 2012. Flight data is now being analysed to provide the basis for a decision on whether to fit the devices as standard.

The aircraft has proved a highly optimal solution for this task, combining a true AEW capability with tolerable operating costs and hence filling the gap between expensive airliner-based platforms and limited performance smaller aircraft.

In the military world even general transports can be put at risk of enemy ground fire, and bitter experience has already shown the hazards of small arms fire and “dumb” weapons fielded by guerilla and terrorist combatants. For that reason Airbus Military is conducting trials of an on-board inert gas-generating system (OBIGGS) for the C295 which injects an inert gas above the void created in fuel tanks as the fuel is consumed and drastically cuts the risk of explosion. The aircraft can already be fitted with removable cockpit armouring, as well as a defensive aids system, and has seen extensive service in the Afghan conflict. Implementation decisions on OBIGGS will be taken soon.

Airbus Military awaits further detail on India’s requirements in the maritime surveillance sphere, but the capabilities of the aircraft in that role also continue to be enhanced. In the ASW role the aircraft is already in service equipped with the Mk 46 torpedo – now work is well advanced to add the MBDA Marte anti-ship missile to the type’s weaponry. Missile-carriage flight trials took place in 2012 and preparations are now underway for missile release tests. Initially the inert missile will be released without a booster to check for satisfactory separation, and then with a booster for more detailed examination of the launch characteristics.

However, it is essential for maritime patrol aircraft to have on-board mission systems that enable their crews to make sense quickly of the incoming sensor data and take the right decisions on how to prosecute targets. Airbus Military already offers one of the world’s most advanced maritime surveillance configurations in its proprietary Fully Integrated Tactical System (FITS) which is in widespread service on the C295 and CN235, as well as the smaller C212, and as a retrofit to the P-3 ASW aircraft of the Spanish and Brazilian Air Forces. It has been integrated with a wide variety of sensors including the Elta 2022.

…in the C295 India has the potential to acquire a proven and high-performing medium transport which is at the top…

But few fields in aviation advance faster than electronics and so the company is intensively working to develop the next generation of FITS at its development laboratory at Getafe near Madrid. A range of enhancements being trialed is expected to offer benefits including: greater processing power particularly for high-resolution image capture and video recording; updated net centric functionalities such as wideband data link, video streaming, and use of remote ground consoles and databases; and a revamped human-machine interface capitalizing on the latest touch screen display technology.

In addition to the transport and maritime surveillance models of the C295, customers have the possibility of using the aircraft in the increasingly important airborne early warning & control (AEW&C) role. The aircraft has proved a highly optimal solution for this task, combining a true AEW capability with tolerable operating costs and hence filling the gap between expensive airliner-based platforms and limited performance smaller aircraft. The C295 was developed in complete secrecy at Airbus Military’s plant in Seville in Spain. Rapid prototyping was once again employed making good use of 3-D computer aided design married to intensive concurrent engineering in order to install a full-scale, 6m diameter, radar rotodome on a C295 for aerodynamic testing. The tests quickly demonstrated the aircraft’s suitability, and the track record of the radar from Airbus Military’s partner ELTA Systems meant that the C295 AEW&C could immediately be offered with confidence to the market where it has secured strong interest.

The clear message is that in the C295 India has the potential to acquire a proven and high-performing medium transport which is at the top of its game today, but with its best yet to come as a transport and in other roles of key interest.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9995900988578796}",positive,0.9995900988578796,1

British tourist pictured drama on flight from Bangkok to Hong Kong

'There was a huge blast... air was rushing into the cabin like a gale'

Passengers wept and stewardess ran down aisle screaming



Emirates spokesman denies their flight was ever 'in jeopardy'



A British tourist told yesterday of his flight of terror when he claims an emergency exit on a super jumbo blew open at 27,000ft.

David Reid and his son Lewis feared a bomb had gone off after hearing a ‘massive explosion’ two hours into their flight on the brand new £250million Emirates Airbus A380.

Freezing air blasted in and the cabin pressure plunged after the door in business class came an inch and a half ajar, leaving a gaping hole, said Mr Reid.

THE PERILS OF CABIN PRESSURE

An open door on an aircraft is a serious emergency because it leads to a sudden loss of cabin pressure. Oxygen levels inside an aeroplane have to be carefully controlled because the air in the atmosphere gets ‘thinner’ – it contains less and less oxygen – the higher you climb. Cabins of planes cruising above 12,000ft are kept pressurised to mimic conditions at around 6,000ft and keep up the levels of oxygen. A sudden rush of ‘thin air’ from outside can cause passengers and crew to experience ear and stomach pain, or even black out due to lack of oxygen. Rob Hunter, of the British Airline Pilots’ Association, said: ‘For a door to open or for a significant gap to appear is extremely rare.’

The drama happened on Monday as the two Britons flew from Bangkok to Hong Kong as part of what was planned as a ‘trip of a lifetime’.

He said: ‘We were about two hours in when suddenly there was a huge blast.

‘It was a real shock, so loud that I thought a bomb might have gone off. Air was gushing into the cabin like a gale.

'The stewardess jumped up and stared at the door. Her face was drained white.

'She ran up the aisle, grabbed the intercom and started screaming, “The door’s going to go, the door’s going to go!” Then she hid under her chair.

‘Other passengers were crying and saying “We’re going to go down, we’re going to go down.”

'It was complete panic. The emergency door was ajar and leaving a gaping hole. You could see straight out into the atmosphere, 27,000ft up.’

Mr Reid, who has a private pilot’s licence, said that after several moments of confusion, the cabin crew started grabbing blankets and pillows which they stuck together with duct tape to fill the gap.

He added: ‘This is a state-of-the-art plane but they were using the most crude method you could imagine to try and plug the hole.

‘The conditions were terrible for the rest of the flight. The door continued to make a horrendously loud droning sound which made it impossible to speak to each other.

'Worst of all, it was absolutely freezing. It was an extremely nerve-wracking experience for everybody.’

He said cabin crew closed the curtain between business class to stop those in the economy cabin below discovering what was happening.

Mr Reid claims he suffered a chest infection following the ordeal and the pair had to cut short their £4,500 trip.

His 18-year-old son reported the incident to the Department of Transport’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch who have passed it on to air investigators at the United Arab Emirates General Authority for Civil Aviation.

An Emirates spokesman said: ‘We can confirm there was a whistling noise emanating from one of the doors on the A380 upper deck on flight EK384 between Bangkok and Hong Kong on Monday, February 11. At no point was the safety of the flight in jeopardy.’

An Airbus spokesman said: ‘It is not possible for a cabin door to open on an A380 or on any aircraft whilst in flight, as doors open inwards and have locking mechanisms.’



An Emirates spokesman later updated the company's statement responding to Mr Reid's claims, saying : 'At no time during the flight did one of the upper deck doors open. There was also no loss in cabin pressurisation at any time during the flight.

'The noise from the door was caused by a small dimensional difference between the inflated door seal and the door lower frame striker plate, when the door is in the closed position.



'This is currently under investigation in conjunction with Airbus. Emirates have now fixed the problem.

'The blankets were placed around the door to abate the whistling sound emanating from the door, not to prevent the door from opening.

'There was no point during the incident where the safety of the flight was in jeopardy.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9978749752044678}",neutral,0.9978749752044678,0

A giant new airport concourse has been opened in Dubai so that the Airbus A380 super-jumbos can land in the Arab country.

The opening of 20 new gates at the international airport are part of the city-state's plans for the facility to become the busiest in the world by 2015.

The first A380 touched down on January 2 but it wasn't officially opened until yesterday.

In total it is expected the project will cost nearly $8billion and the ability to land the 525-seater planes is seen as a major boost for the European Airbus consortium.

Emirates, an airline based in Dubai, currently flies 31 A380s with another 59 on order.

Riyadh's first operational MRTT carries the service registration 2402. Powered by two General Electric CF6-80E engines, the platform is equipped with an aerial refuelling boom system and under-wing hose and drogue refuelling pods, enabling it to support the air force's Boeing F-15, Eurofighter Typhoon and Panavia Tornado combat aircraft. The Saudi aircraft can also carry up to 266 passengers, in a two-class configuration.

Airbus Military Royal Saudi Air Force personnel have previously trained on the MRTT in Spain

Introduction of the new type supports an expansion in the Royal Saudi Air Force's inflight refuelling capabilities. The service's inventory already includes seven Boeing 707-derived KE-3A tankers delivered in 1987, says Flightglobal's MiliCAS database.

The service milestone in Saudi Arabia came just weeks after the early February delivery of the first of three MRTT aircraft to the United Arab Emirates. It was also followed on 27 February by the Royal Australian Air Force announcing that its fleet of five locally designated KC-30As had achieved initial operating capability. The A330-based tanker/transport is also in service as the Voyager with the UK Royal Air Force, which is using the type in a passenger transport role only.

Feb 20, 2013 | By Luxuo

Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, ranked #29 on the list of global billionaires by Forbes magazine, has sold off his Airbus A380 jet plane, according to media reports.

Prince Alwaleed, whose net worth in March 2012 was estimated at $18 billion, ordered the A380 way back in 2007, and had ordered multi-million-dollar customisations to it, which made the media dub his aircraft as ‘the flying palace’.

The 57-year-old used the proceeds from the sale to expand his investments in Saudi Arabia and the greater Middle East, Sanbar said in an e-mail.

Alwaleed’s fortune has surged $8.5 billion since April 2012 as Kingdom shares have almost doubled in value. The diversified investment company, which controls stakes in Citigroup, News Corporation and the George V hotel in Paris, accounts for more than two-thirds of Alwaleed’s net worth.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999881982803345}",neutral,0.9999881982803345,0

ALC leasing places giant order with Airbus: company - SKNVibes.com,"Mon, 04 Feb 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vbS5za252aWJlcy5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXdzZGV0YWlscy5jZm0vNjkyODfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Paris, FRA) - US group Air Lease Corporation ALC has placed a giant order for airliners built by European manufacturer Airbus worth about $9.0 billion (6.64 billion euros) at catalogue prices, Airbus said on Monday.

The order is for 20 A350-900 aircraft, five A350-1000, and also converts an option for 14 fuel-efficient A321neo aircraft into an order, Airbus said in a statement.

The chief executive of ALC Steven Udvar-Hazy said in a statement that the A350 XWB (Xtra wide body) airliner ""is becoming the industry benchmark for efficiency in the long haul segment, and the A320neo family is ideal for airlines operating short to medium-haul missions.""

He said: ""These aircraft will help airlines grow their businesses while simultaneously reducing their operating costs and emissions.""

He added that his company aimed to offer its customers ""the most modern, efficient aircraft on the market, and both the A350 XWB and the NEO fit right in that category.""

The A350 is due to enter service in the second half of 2014.

The aircraft is intended to compete with the Boeing 777 aircraft made by the US Boeing Company and with the Boeing Dreamliner 787.

Airbus hopes that the new aircraft will enable it to end Boeing's dominance of the market for long-range airliners.

The A350 XWB family of aircraft is made mainly of composite materials based on carbon. It is being offered in three version capable of carrying 270-350 passengers.

The first version to be put into service will be the A350-900 with 314 seats. It will be followed in 2016 by the A350-800 with 270 seats and in 2017 by the A350-1000 with 350 seats.

Airbus said that ALC had also taken an option on an extra five A350-1000 aircraft.

The Airbus statement said that the A320neo series of aircraft, due to enter in service in 2015, would deliver ""up to 15 percent in fuel savings which is equivalent to 1.4 million litres of fuel - the consumption of 1,000 mid-size cars, saving 3,600 tons of CO2 per aircraft per year.""

The manufacturer said that the A320 family of aircraft, with more than 9,000 aircraft ordered and more than 5,400 aircraft delivered to more than 380 customers, was the world's ""best-selling single-aisle aircraft family"".","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9987899661064148}",neutral,0.9987899661064148,0
Airbus will not use lithium batteries in A350: source - SKNVibes.com,"Fri, 15 Feb 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vbS5za252aWJlcy5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXdzZGV0YWlscy5jZm0vNjk3OTLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Paris, FRA) - Airbus will not use lithium batteries in the A350 long-range liner under development, a company source told AFP, as investigations continue into battery fires that have grounded rival Boeing's 787 carriers.

""The first planes will be delivered with cadmium, not lithium batteries,"" the source said on Friday, adding that the airliner's first test flights will nevertheless take place with the lithium batteries.

The announcement comes as Boeing's 50 Dreamliners in service around the world have been grounded since January, after battery smoke forced an emergency landing of one plane and a battery fire was reported on a parked plane.

US air safety investigators have since zeroed in on how a battery fire occurred on the parked plane -- a Japanese Airlines 787 at Boston's Logan airport -- saying that evidence pointed to a single cell on the eight-cell lithium-ion battery, which short circuited, leading to a rise in temperature.

Investigators do not yet know what specifically caused the short circuit.

The Airbus A350 is due to enter service in the second half of 2014, with the company hoping the liner will make it competitive in the long-haul market, where its planes have found it hard to challenge Boeing's 747s and 777s.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6770267486572266}",neutral,0.6770267486572266,0

FRESH attempts were made yesterday to refloat an Airbus ferry which ran aground in bad weather in Mostyn.

The ship, which carries wings made at Airbus’ Broughton plant to France for assembly, got into trouble on Wednesday.

Tugs from Mostyn Port were brought in yesterday to free it after attempts on Wednesday night failed.

Yesterday it had been moved into deeper water, but was still not fully afloat.

It is not uncommon for ferries to experience this type of problem in high tide.

An Airbus spokesman said: “It got into trouble because of the bad weather on Wednesday. There was no damage to the ship, it was not leaking fuel and there was no other danger from the ferry.”","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9992139339447021}",negative,0.9992139339447021,-1
