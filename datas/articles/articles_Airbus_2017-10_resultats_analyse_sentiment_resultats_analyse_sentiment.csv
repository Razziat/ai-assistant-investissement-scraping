Airbus and Bombardier Announce C Series Partnership - Airbus,"Mon, 16 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNy0xMC1haXJidXMtYW5kLWJvbWJhcmRpZXItYW5ub3VuY2UtYy1zZXJpZXMtcGFydG5lcnNoaXDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"· Airbus to acquire majority stake in the C Series Aircraft Limited Partnership

· Partnership brings together two complementary product lines, with 100-150 seat market segment expected to represent more than 6,000 new aircraft over the next 20 years

· Combination of Airbus’ global reach and scale with Bombardier’s newest aircraft family to create significant value for customers, suppliers, employees and shareholders

· Significant C Series production costs savings anticipated by leveraging Airbus’ supply chain expertise

· Commitment to Québec: C Series Aircraft Limited Partnership headquarters and primary assembly to remain in Québec, with the support of both companies’ global supply chains

· Airbus’ global industrial footprint expands with the C Series Final Assembly Line in Canada, resulting in a positive impact on operations in Québec and across the country

· Growing market for C Series results in second Final Assembly Line in Mobile, Alabama, serving U.S. customers

Amsterdam / Montreal, 16 October 2017 – Airbus SE (EPA: AIR) and Bombardier Inc. (TSX: BBD.B) are to become partners on the C Series aircraft programme. A corresponding agreement was signed today. The agreement brings together Airbus’ global reach and scale with Bombardier’s newest, state-of-the-art jet aircraft family, positioning both partners to fully unlock the value of the C Series platform and create significant new value for customers, suppliers, employees and shareholders.

Under the agreement, Airbus will provide procurement, sales and marketing, and customer support expertise to the C Series Aircraft Limited Partnership (CSALP), the entity that manufactures and sells the C Series. At closing, Airbus will acquire a 50.01% interest in CSALP. Bombardier and Investissement Québec (IQ) will own approximately 31% and 19% respectively.

CSALP’s headquarters and primary assembly line and related functions will remain in Québec, with the support of Airbus’ global reach and scale. Airbus’ global industrial footprint will expand with the Final Assembly Line in Canada and additional C Series production at Airbus’ manufacturing site in Alabama, U.S. This strengthening of the programme and global cooperation will have positive effects on Québec and Canadian aerospace operations.

The single aisle market is a key growth driver, representing 70% of the expected global future demand for aircraft. Ranging from 100 to 150 seats, the C Series is highly complementary to Airbus’ existing single aisle aircraft portfolio, which focuses on the higher end of the single-aisle business (150-240 seats). The world class sales, marketing and support networks that Airbus brings into the venture are expected to strengthen and accelerate the C Series’ commercial momentum. Additionally, Airbus’ supply chain expertise is expected to generate significant C Series production cost savings.

Airbus is strongly committed to Canada and its aerospace sector with Canadian suppliers extending their access to Airbus’ global supply chain. This new C Series partnership is set to secure jobs in Canada for many years to come.

""This is a win-win for everybody! The C Series, with its state-of-the-art design and great economics, is a great fit with our existing single-aisle aircraft family and rapidly extends our product offering into a fast growing market sector. I have no doubt that our partnership with Bombardier will boost sales and the value of this programme tremendously,” said Airbus Chief Executive Officer Tom Enders. ""Not only will this partnership secure the C Series and its industrial operations in Canada, the U.K. and China, but we also bring new jobs to the U.S. Airbus will benefit from strengthening its product portfolio in the high-volume single-aisle market, offering superior value to our airline customers worldwide.""

“We are very pleased to welcome Airbus to the C Series programme,” said Alain Bellemare, President and Chief Executive Officer of Bombardier Inc. “Airbus is the perfect partner for us, Québec and Canada. Their global scale, strong customer relationships and operational expertise are key ingredients for unleashing the full value of the C Series. This partnership should more than double the value of the C Series programme and ensures our remarkable game-changing aircraft realizes its full potential.”

“The arrival of Airbus as a strategic partner today will ensure the sustainability and growth of the C Series programme, as well as consolidating the entire Québec aerospace cluster. In the current context, the partnership with Airbus is, for us, the best solution to ensure the maintenance and creation of jobs in this strategic sector of the Québec economy,"" said Québec’s Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Economy, Science and Innovation and Minister responsible for Digital Strategy, Dominique Anglade.

Ownership Structure and Agreement Highlights



The C Series programme is operated by CSALP in respect of which Bombardier and IQ respectively hold approximately a 62% and a 38% interest. The Investment Agreement contemplates Airbus acquiring a 50.01% interest in CSALP. Airbus will enter into commercial agreements relating to (i) sales and marketing support services for the C Series, (ii) management of procurement, which will include leading negotiations to improve CSALP level supplier agreements, and (iii) customer support. At closing, there will be no cash contribution by any of the partners, nor will CSALP assume any financial debt. It also contemplates that Bombardier will continue with its current funding plan of CSALP and will fund, if required, the cash shortfalls of CSALP during the first year following the closing up to a maximum amount of US$350 million, and during the second and third years following the closing up to a maximum aggregate amount of US$350 million over both years, in consideration for non-voting participating shares of CSALP with cumulative annual dividends of 2%, with any excess shortfall during such periods to be shared proportionately amongst Class A shareholders.

Airbus will benefit from call rights in respect of all of Bombardier’s interest in CSALP at fair market value, with the amount for non-voting participating shares used by Bombardier capped at the invested amount plus accrued but unpaid dividends, including a call right exercisable no earlier than 7.5 years following the closing, except in the event of certain changes in the control of Bombardier, in which case the right is accelerated. Bombardier will benefit from a corresponding put right whereby it could require that Airbus acquire its interest at fair market value after the expiry of the same period. IQ’s interest is redeemable at fair market value by CSALP, under certain conditions, starting in 2023. IQ will also benefit from tag along rights in connection with a sale by Bombardier of its interest in the partnership.

The Board of Directors of CSALP will initially consist of seven directors, four of whom will be proposed by Airbus, two of whom will be proposed by Bombardier, and one of whom will be proposed by IQ. Airbus will be entitled to name the Chairman of CSALP.

Subject to obtaining the required approval from the Toronto Stock Exchange, the transaction also provides for the issuance to Airbus, upon closing, of warrants exercisable to acquire up to 100,000,000 Class B Shares (subordinate voting) of Bombardier (representing approximately 5% of the aggregate issued and outstanding Class A Shares (multiple voting) and Class B Shares of Bombardier on a fully-diluted basis, and approximately 5% of the aggregate issued and outstanding Class A Shares and Class B Shares on a non-diluted basis), at an exercise price per share equal to the US$ equivalent of C$2.29, which represents the volume-weighted average price of the Class B Shares over the five trading days ending Friday, 13 October 2017. The warrants will have a five-year term from the date of issue, will not be listed and will provide for market standard adjustment provisions, including in the event of corporate changes, stock splits, non-cash dividends, distributions of rights, options or warrants to all or substantially all shareholders or consolidations.

The issuance of the warrants and their terms were negotiated between Bombardier and Airbus at arm’s length and will not materially affect control of Bombardier. Security holder approval will be required under Toronto Stock Exchange rules due to the fact that the warrants will be issued later than 45 days from the date upon which the exercise price was established. Such approval is expected to be obtained by way of written consent of shareholders holding more than 50% of the voting rights attached to all of Bombardier’s issued and outstanding shares.

The transaction has been approved by the Boards of Directors of both Airbus and Bombardier, as well as the Cabinet of the Government of Québec. The transaction remains subject to regulatory approvals, as well as other conditions usual in this type of transaction. There are no guarantees that the transaction will be completed and that the conditions to which it is subject would be met. Completion of the transaction is currently expected for the second half of 2018.

"Airbus partners with Canada's Bombardier, complicating trade dispute over Boeing jets - GeekWire","Mon, 16 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlZWt3aXJlLmNvbS8yMDE3L2FpcmJ1cy1wYXJ0bmVycy1jYW5hZGFzLWJvbWJhcmRpZXItY29tcGxpY2F0aW5nLWJvZWluZy1qZXQtZGlzcHV0ZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus added a twist to a U.S.-Canada trade dispute by announcing a plan to partner up with Bombardier, the Boeing Co.’s Canadian rival.

The plan calls for Airbus to take on a majority stake in Bombardier’s C Series line of passenger jets, which is due to be hit by U.S. tariffs of nearly 300 percent.

Europe-based Airbus will own 50.01 percent of the C Series limited partnership, leaving Bombardier with about 31 percent and Investissement Quebec with 19 percent. The partnership’s headquarters and primary assembly line will remain in Quebec, but Airbus said it would expand C Series production to its manufacturing site in Alabama.

No money will change hands immediately under the terms of the deal.

The two companies said the partnership would play off their complementary strengths. “This is a win-win for everybody,” Airbus CEO Tom Enders said in a news release.

“This partnership should more than double the value of the C Series program and ensures our remarkable game-changing aircraft realizes its full potential,” said Alain Bellemare, Bombardier’s president and CEO.

It could also affect U.S. plans to move forward with the trade sanctions. The tariffs, which were proposed by the Commerce Department and are currently being considered by the U.S. International Trade Commission, target Canadian-made jets.

The new C Series partnership could conceivably get around the sanctions by delivering jets that are made in Alabama. What’s more, Airbus has an option to buy out Bombardier and the Quebec investment agency by 2023 — and company executives signaled that they intended to take that option.

The trade flap arose last year after Bombardier announced the sale of 75 single-aisle CS100 jets to Delta, with an option for 50 more jets. Boeing complained that Bombardier was being subsidized unfairly by the Canadian government, and that the Delta deal would have a negative effect on Boeing’s own sales. The Commerce Department agreed.

This looks like a questionable deal between two heavily state-subsidized competitors.

Boeing, which has been embroiled in a separate set of trade disputes with Airbus, voiced suspicions about the arrangement announced today.

“This looks like a questionable deal between two heavily state-subsidized competitors to skirt the recent findings of the U.S. government,” Boeing said in a statement. “Our position remains that everyone should play by the same rules for free and fair trade to work.”

The Boeing-Bombardier battle already has had repercussions extending beyond the Delta purchase. The flap has cast a pall over talks revisiting the North American Free Trade Agreement. And if the dispute were to escalate, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his government might not go through with a multibillion-dollar purchase of Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jets.

Canadian officials have pointed out that Bombardier’s C Series operation makes use of U.S. suppliers, supporting 23,000 jobs in U.S. locations including Washington state.

Delta disputes the claim that the Bombardier deal hurts Boeing’s sales, citing the fact that Boeing doesn’t sell jets with the 100- to 110-seat capacity that it was looking for. Boeing, however, says Bombardier’s sales tactics for C Series jets threaten the viability of the 737 MAX 7 in the 100- to 150-seat category.

The Airbus-Bombardier deal is still subject to regulatory approvals. The two companies say they expect the transaction to be complete by the second half of 2018.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9953126907348633}",neutral,0.9953126907348633,0
Airbus takes stake in Bombardier | Arkansas Democrat Gazette - Arkansas Online,"Wed, 18 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFya2Fuc2Fzb25saW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMTcvb2N0LzE4L2FpcmJ1cy10YWtlcy1zdGFrZS1pbi1ib21iYXJkaWVyLTIwMTcxMC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has agreed to acquire a majority stake in Bombardier Inc.'s C Series program and will start assembling the jetliner in the U.S., vaulting a technologically advanced but slow-selling plane onto the front lines of the battle with Boeing over global aircraft sales.

Without putting up a dime at closing, Airbus will take just over half of a partnership controlling the C Series. The European plane-maker's marketing muscle and production expertise boost the viability of the all-new aircraft after more than $6 billion in development costs forced Bombardier to rely on government assistance.

The deal, announced Monday, also thrusts Airbus into the middle of a bitter trade spat between the Canadian manufacturer and Boeing. After a Boeing complaint that Bombardier sold 75 of its C Series jets to Delta Air Lines for ""absurdly low prices,"" President Donald Trump's administration slapped the aircraft with import duties of 300 percent in recent weeks -- roiling U.S. relations with Canada and the U.K., where Bombardier makes the plane's wings.

In a potential effort to circumvent the tariffs, Airbus will add another final assembly line for the C Series at its factory in Mobile, Ala. The facility will serve U.S. customers and complement production in Canada, according to a company statement late Monday.

""This is a program that has been waiting for a deus ex machina, and wow, it really got one,"" Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group, said in an interview. The deal casts Airbus as a global player while Boeing comes off as ""a bit shortsighted and protectionist. It makes Boeing look like they've been playing tick-tack-toe against a chess master.""

Airbus shares rose 2.8 percent in Paris trading, increasing the gains for the year to 26 percent and valuing the company at $72.2 billion.

""The main risk would appear to be only that Airbus gets distracted,"" Sandy Morris, a London analyst with Jefferies, said in a note.

Boeing shares fell less than 1 percent to close Tuesday at $258.62 in New York. The company's 67 percent advance this year through Monday leads the Dow Jones industrial average. Bombardier has climbed 9.7 percent this year. Bloomberg reported Sunday that the Canadian manufacturer is exploring options for its aerospace assets.

It's too soon to say whether the new Alabama production line would enable the C Series to avoid U.S. tariffs. The duties were applied to C Series planes ""regardless of whether they enter the United States fully or partially assembled,"" according to a U.S. government fact sheet on the matter. Boeing said Airbus and Bombardier were just trying to get around the restrictions.

""This looks like a questionable deal between two heavily state-subsidized competitors to skirt the recent findings of the U.S. government,"" Boeing, the world's largest aerospace company, said in an emailed statement. ""Our position remains that everyone should play by the same rules for free and fair trade to work.""

Discussions with Bombardier started in August, said Airbus Chief Executive Officer Tom Enders. The Canadian company also had been in touch with a small group of Chinese state-owned enterprises about a C Series stake, said two people familiar with the talks.

Bombardier's talks with China included Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China, said one of the people, who asked not to be named because discussions were private. Commercial Aircraft Corp. declined to comment on the Airbus deal and its media relations department said it wasn't aware of any talks with Bombardier. The Canadian company declined to comment.

The Bombardier deal marks a reversal for Enders, who vetoed a similar accord just two years ago, when the future of the C Series was in doubt and Airbus was grappling with the ramp-up of its bigger A350 model. Airbus isn't interested in any other Bombardier assets, he said.

""Airbus gives the program security,"" he said of the C Series in a telephone interview. Whereas some customers may have wavered previously because they couldn't be sure of long-term customer support from the manufacturer, Airbus' industrial heft changes the equation, he said.

Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau discussed the deal Monday evening in a phone call, according to a statement from Trudeau's office that provided no details of the conversation.

Bombardier hasn't landed a major order for the plane, which typically seats 108 to 160 passengers, since the Delta deal 18 months ago. The company values the C Series at about $2 billion, and expects the joint venture to double the value of the program, CEO Alain Bellemare said at a news conference late Monday in Montreal.

The company has agreed to provide $350 million in funding for the C Series in the first 12 months after the close of the deal, and as much as $350 million more, if required, over the two subsequent years, said Chief Financial Officer John Di Bert.

The aircraft is a medium-to-long-range wide-body jet with a Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engine. The two versions, the A330-800 and A330-900, can accommodate 257 and 287 passengers respectively.

'Neo' stands for new engine option.

The A330-900 version, which took to the skies this morning, is destined for full certification around the middle of 2018. The slightly smaller A330-800 is set to follow in 2019.

Tweet 1

Airbus has claimed the latest A330 will use 14 percent less fuel per seat.

Industry observers suggest the fuel-friendly revision is designed to up competition with the latest version of Boeing's 787 Dreamliner.

The A330-800 is built to fly a maximum of 13,900 kilometers while the 900 should cover 12,130 kilometers.

The agreement is notable because the CSeries had been at the center of a fight between Bombardier and Boeing, which in turn had turned into a diplomatic spat between the United Kingdom and Canadian governments (where Bombardier’s production is based) on the one hand versus the United States. The U.S. had been threatening Bombardier with punitive tariffs equaling 300 percent of the jet’s value, essentially killing a planned sale to Delta Airlines. Under the new Bombardier-Airbus deal, at least some of the production of the CSeries is expected to take place at Airbus’ Alabama plant, thus potentially avoiding U.S. tariffs–though international trade lawyers note it’s not yet clear if this will be the case , given the complexity of U.S. trade enforcement laws.

These latest developments are in fact just the latest salvo in a decades-long fight over aircraft subsidies. The two lead actors in this drama are Boeing and Airbus, with supporting roles played by Bombardier and Brazil’s Embraer. Ever since Airbus emerged some 40 years ago to challenge Boeing’s position as the world’s dominant aircraft manufacturer, governments have been accusing one another of illegitimately propping up their respective national champions, while simultaneously professing their own innocence in providing support. Before the U.S. took on Canadian subsidies to Bombardier, it had long been decrying the “launch aid” European governments gave Airbus to help it bring new models to market. The Europeans, for their part, complained about the indirect subsidies Boeing received in terms of inflated defense procurement contracts and NASA research expenditures. The two sides reached something of a truce in a 1992 agreement that set limits on subsidies, but that deal broke down about a decade ago, and since then the disputants have been fighting it out in a series of seemingly never-ending World Trade Organization (WTO) disputes. Meanwhile Brazil and Embraer have also brought their complaints against Bombardier—which are very similar to the grievances alleged by Boeing—to the WTO, in a case that is still pending. All in all, aircraft manufacturing is arguably the most contested industry in international trade governance.

The irony is that the traditional tools of trade governance are particularly ill-suited to aircraft manufacturing. The basic logic behind trade enforcement mechanisms, whether pursued unilaterally or multilaterally through the WTO, is an attempt to “level the playing field,” or to correct the market for the distortions of government interventions. The problem is, when it comes to aircraft manufacturing, there’s never been anything close to a perfectly competitive, distortion-free market: It’s politics and subsidies all the way down. Not only are there tons of subsidies on the production side, but governments are also the most important consumers of aircraft, buying both military planes and consumer planes for publicly-owned national airlines.

Thus the aircraft market consists of governments subsidizing production by their national champions, then lobbying other governments to buy their planes—often linking these procurement decisions to diplomatic relationships. Indeed, in late August President Donald Trump sparked a diplomatic hiccup when, at a joint press conference with Finnish president Sauli Niinistö, Trump announced that Finland would be buying F-18 fighter jets from Boeing, news which Finland promptly denied. Two weeks later, meeting with Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, Trump announced Malaysia would be buying new Boeing jets. And such high level political interventions in airline sales are nothing new: a New York Times analysis of leaked diplomatic cables revealed how American ambassadors and envoys frequently served as Boeing salespeople throughout the last decade.

How much are such diplomatic overtures—an indirect form of government support—worth to Boeing? There’s no good methodology to reasonably price this subsidy. And this points to the larger problem in trying to arrive at a “fair” outcome in the aircraft subsidy complaints: Given how governments are so deeply and fundamentally involved in the industry, asking what a jet would cost in the absence of government distortions to the market is an impossible question. Government distortions constitute the aircraft market; take them away, and there’s nothing left.

Ultimately the aircraft manufacturing industry shows both the strengths and limits of the rules-based, legal approach to global economic governance. The WTO has made a valiant attempt to discipline some of the more direct subsidies governments provide to their aircraft manufacturers. But the legal record shows it has been a long, drawn-out fight, with no signs of easing. And the institution is not cut out to weigh into the informal, indirect subsidies provided by defense contracts, let alone adjudicate how much diplomatic pressure is appropriate in pushing for a jet sale. It’s unclear if governments could ever delegate binding enforcement over such matters to an international organization. Informal truces hashed out by diplomats, rather than binding legal agreements, may be the best that can be hoped for.

Meanwhile, looming on the horizon is a bigger and potentially far messier aircraft subsidy fight. In May of this year, China’s COMAC, a state-owned aircraft manufacturer, completed a successful first flight test of its new jetliner, designed to compete with Boeing and Airbus. For now neither Boeing nor Airbus wants to take an aggressive stance against COMAC, as the two Western companies don’t want to risk losing out on lucrative sales to China’s domestic airlines. But ultimately they—along with their government backers—will need a strategy for dealing with this new challenger. Perhaps this will finally prompt Boeing and Airbus to aim their attacks away from one another and toward a common threat, just as Siemens and Alstom recently joined forces to take on the China Railway Rolling Stock Corporation, China’s state-backed train maker that’s winning more and more contracts overseas. In the meantime, expect the aircraft subsidy feuds to continue; at the moment Boeing seems to have lost the battle, but the war is far from over.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9877476692199707}",neutral,0.9877476692199707,0

Bombardier Turns to Airbus to Salvage Imperiled Airliner - The New York Times,"Mon, 16 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMTcvMTAvMTYvYnVzaW5lc3MvYm9tYmFyZGllci1haXJidXMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"OTTAWA — Bombardier turned to Airbus on Monday to save an airliner that has been surrounded by uncertainty even before it was hit with a potentially crippling trade action by Boeing in the United States.

In an unexpected announcement, Airbus and Bombardier, which is based in Montreal, formed a partnership on Monday to make and sell the CSeries airliner. Airbus will hold 50.1 percent of the venture but will not make any payment, future investment in the project or assume any debt related to the airliner, which has cost more than $5 billion to develop and put into production.

The arrangement gives Bombardier a way to make an end-run around two preliminary trade rulings that, if finalized, would impose tariffs that would more than quadruple the cost of the airliner in the United States, its key market. The two companies said they would move swiftly to open a CSeries assembly line in Mobile, Ala., where Airbus already makes its A320 airliners, that would most likely allow planes made there to avoid the enormous import duties.

Tom Enders, the chief executive of Airbus, and Alain Bellemare, his counterpart at Bombardier, told reporters that the agreement was not related to the trade action brought by Boeing. But they also said that many airlines had shied away from the CSeries because of concerns about the future of the project, which has been troubled by cost overruns and delays, and the future of Bombardier itself.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9961602687835693}",neutral,0.9961602687835693,0

Highly capable helicopters produced in Columbus, Miss. by veteran workforce

Washington, D.C. – Airbus Helicopters has delivered the U.S. Army’s 400th UH-72A Lakota helicopter, fulfilling its contract requirements to date by delivering every aircraft on time, on budget and meeting the Army’s rigorous quality standards.



“From the moment when the Army awarded Airbus the contract to produce the UH-72A, our team has strived daily to deliver on our promises to the Army, to the dedicated soldiers who operate these aircraft, to the U.S. government and the taxpayers,” said Chris Emerson, President of Airbus Helicopters Inc. “We have produced a superb aircraft that meets the Army’s requirements and quality standards, and we have also delivered on our promise to provide outstanding support to keep the Army’s Lakotas flying and ready to perform vital missions.”

The UH-72A is one of the key helicopter models the Army will operate for the foreseeable future. The Lakota platform is a versatile and highly capable twin-engine aircraft with a modern digital glass cockpit, flight controls and navigation systems. Army and Army National Guard units operate the Lakota in a variety of missions including flight training, surveillance and reconnaissance, medical evacuations, border security, VIP transport and disaster response.

The UH-72A is proudly made in America, assembled at the Airbus Helicopters Inc. facility in Columbus, Miss. by a workforce that is more than 40 percent U.S. military veterans.

Selected by the U.S. Army in 2006 following a rigorous evaluation, the UH-72A is the Army’s lowest cost twin-engine helicopter to buy, own and operate. As part of its Aviation Restructuring Initiative, the Army selected the Lakota for its Initial Entry Rotary Wing Training program at Fort Rucker. The U.S. Naval Test Pilot School also operates the Lakota in a training role.

Since the Lakota’s introduction, the Army and National Guard units have flown more than 460,000 hours with Airbus Helicopters Inc. providing materiel support that exceeded all of the contract requirements.

In December 2016 the Army awarded Airbus Helicopters Inc. a five-year Contractor Logistics Support valued at nearly $1 billion. Airbus Helicopters Inc. will provide the support at Army and National Guard bases in 43 states, including Fort Rucker, and in Kwajalein, Guam, Puerto Rico and Germany.

Airbus, the European rival to Boeing plane manufacturer, announced Monday it would buy a majority stake in Bombardier’s C Series jet that has been threatened with a 300% U.S. tariff.

The deal is the latest volley in a major trade dispute, as Airbus plans to build some of the 6,000 planes projected over the next 20 years at its new assembly line in Mobile, Ala.

The deal calls for Airbus to provide procurement, sales and marketing support for the planes, which will seat 100 to 150 passengers, in exchange for 50.01% of the program.

""Some customers will be convinced it will be a great product and it is here to stay,"" Airbus CEO Tom Enders said in a statement.

TODAY IN THE SKY: Delta CEO defiantly expects to get Bombardier planes without threatened 300% tariff

But Boeing, which had complained about Canadian subsidies for Bombardier, remained critical of the deal.

""This looks like a questionable deal between two heavily state-subsidized competitors to skirt the recent findings of the U.S. government,” Dan Curran, a Boeing spokesman, said in a statement. “Our position remains that everyone should play by the same rules for free and fair trade to work.”

IN PICTURES: Bombardier's CS 300 completes first flight (story continues below)

The U.S. Commerce Department recently announced preliminary duties of 80% and 220% on the C Series planes. But those decisions must still be finalized and the U.S. International Trade Commission could still overrule them.

Michael Luttig, Boeing's general counsel, said the tariff would have to be placed on any imported plane or part, or it wouldn't allowed into the country.

""The announced deal has no impact on the pending proceedings at all,"" Luttig said.

Delta Air Lines, for one, would like to buy the planes. Delta placed an order last year for 75 of the planes and CEO Ed Bastian told investors during an earnings call that the carrier expects to pay for them without the tariff.

“We will not pay those tariffs. That is very clear,"" Bastian told investors Oct. 11. ""We intend to take the aircraft.""

While Boeing alleged that the planes compete against variations of its popular 737 aircraft, Bastian argued that there was no Boeing option and that the only competitor is the Embraer E190 aircraft from Brazil.

Enders said the Bombardier deal provides an Airbus offering of planes with 100 to 150 seats. The A320 family, which competes against the 737, has 150 to 240 seats.

""I have no doubt that our partnership with Bombardier will boost sales and the value of this program tremendously,” Enders said. ""Not only will this partnership secure the C Series and its industrial operations in Canada, the U.K. and China, but we also bring new jobs to the U.S.""

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said his government could stop doing business with Boeing if the U.S. doesn't drop its trade complaint against Bombardier.

Canada had been in talks to purchase 18 Super Hornet fighter jets from Boeing, but those have been on hold because of the Bombardier dispute.

“The arrival of Airbus as a strategic partner today will ensure the sustainability and growth of the C Series program, as well as consolidating the entire Québec aerospace cluster,"" said Dominique Anglade, Quebec's deputy prime minster of economy, science and innovation.



Jerry Dias, national president of Unifor, Canada's largest private sector union, said the U.S. effort to weaken Bombardier actually strengthened it.

""The attempt to weaken Bombardier has pushed it to join with one of its competitors, which should not have had needed to happen,"" he said.

Airbus is not assuming any debt as part of the deal and it has an option to buy out Bombardier after seven-and-a-half years and the Quebec government in 2023.

The C Series program drove Bombardier to the brink of bankruptcy two years ago before it was bailed out by the Quebec government.

Bombardier chief Alain Bellemare said having Airbus as a strategic partner ""increases confidence that the aircraft is here to stay.""

By noon Tuesday, Bombardier's stock had risen 19% to $2.81 Canadian dollars per share.

Chicago-based Boeing's complaint claims Bombardier's new C Series passenger aircraft receives Canadian government subsidies that give it an advantage internationally. The Quebec government invested $1 billion in exchange for a 49.5% stake in the C Series last year. Canada's federal government also recently provided a $275 million loan to Bombardier, which struggled to win orders.

Editor's note: Check back later Thursday morning for more photos from the scene in France.

TOULOUSE, France -- Airbus' latest jet, the A330-900neo, took to the skies for the first time on Thursday here in the south of France.

The airplane took off from Toulouse-Blagnac International Airport at 9:57 a.m. local time, flying for several hours over southern France before completing its first landing.



If the name of the jet does not sound especially new, you'd be right. The airplane is a next-generation version of Airbus' popular-but-aging A330 line that started in 1992.



The -900neo is intended to be a replacement of the original A330-300 that first began flying 25 years ago. The just-introduced neo version can fly further more efficiently, thanks in large part to newer, larger engines and other aerodynamic improvements. It can also seat marginally more passengers.

Passengers may notice any of several changes, says Airbus. Larger overhead bins will improve space by 66%, according to the company. Other improvements include LED lighting, upgraded in-flight entertainment, better lavatory options and the retention of the airplane's much-loved 2-4-2 economy layout.

TODAY IN THE SKY: Airbus says North American airlines now flying 1,500 of its jets (story continues below)

The first flight comes a bit later than Airbus originally had planned. Delays, chiefly with the airplane's Rolls Royce-made Trent 7000 engines, mounted over the past year. It was originally slated to enter service at the end of the year with TAP Portugal, a target that has now slipped into 2018.

Two more -900 jets will join the original in its flight test operations as the plane moves toward certification.

Airbus has also started production on the -900neo's smaller sibling, the -800neo. The -800 will seat fewer passengers than the -900, but will be able to to fly further by about 1,000 miles. That model is is expected to make its first flight in the first half of 2018.

Both jets follow Airbus' recent strategy of veering away from headline-grabbing new, ""clean-sheet"" airplanes in favor of re-engineing and upgrading an essentially already proven platform.

Airbus has already taken a similar tack with its narrowbody, single-aisle A320 jet family.

IN PICTURES: Behind the scenes: Airbus' A350 final assembly line

The decision to launch the A320neo proved successful, with airlines across the globe scrambling to order the airplanes as Airbus' order book filled up. Airbus delivered the first of those jets in January 2016.

Whether the A330neo will reach the same level of success is not yet clear.

So far Airbus has booked 212 firm orders for the A330neo family, though some of those face uncertainty.

Several airlines have recently toyed with the idea of swapping it for other jets. AirAsiaX, for example, has said it's considering switching its order for 66 A330-900neos for larger Airbus A350s instead. Hawaiian, meanwhile, is considering ditching the -800 altogether. The airline, realizing it is the only carrier to have ordered the smaller jet to date, has floated upgrading to a larger jet with either Airbus or Boeing.

Airbus says it is not concerned about the slow start, pointing to the throngs of current A330 classic operators whose airplanes will soon be nearing the end of their life cycles.

TODAY IN THE SKY: Airbus takes majority stake in Bombardier's C Series program

The first flight also comes just days after the European aerospace giant sent shockwaves through the industry after announcing it had acquired a majority stake in the struggling, Canadian-made Bombardier C Series passenger jet program.



The acquisition positions Airbus to be able to sell and build jets ranging from the 100-seat C Series to the superjumbo Airbus A380 that can seat more than 600 passengers, depending on how carriers configure its seating.



For its part, Bombardier will gain access to Airbus' vast manufacturing and sales acumen, which is expected to give the to date poor-selling C Series a much-needed shot in the arm.

On Monday, Airbus and Bombardier announced that the two airplane makers would join forces on the next-generation C Series airliner.

The deal sees Airbus acquiring a 50.01% equity stake in Bombardier's C Series program and producing US-bound C Series jets at its plant in Mobile, Alabama.

Production of all other C Series jets will remain in Canada, where Bombardier is based.

Mechanisms within the deal will see the Europe-based Airbus take 100% ownership of the C Series program within five years.

It's a move that looks to be in direct response to the US Department of Commerce's proposed 299.45% tariff on Delta Air Lines' order for 75 C Series jets. The tariffs are a result of a complaint the American aerospace company Boeing filed in April.

Both Airbus and Bombardier believe that shifting production to Alabama will get around any proposed tariffs.

""This looks like a questionable deal between two heavily state-subsidized competitors to skirt the recent findings of the US government,"" Boeing said in a statement. ""Our position remains that everyone should play by the same rules for free and fair trade to work.""

Airbus will make no up-front financial investment but will provide procurement, marketing, sales, and customer-support expertise.

In other words, Airbus just took ownership of one of the most advanced jetliner programs in the world for zero up-front cash.

""This is a win-win for everybody!"" Airbus CEO Tom Enders said in a statement. ""The C Series, with its state-of-the-art design and great economics, is a great fit with our existing single-aisle aircraft family and rapidly extends our product offering into a fast-growing market sector.""

""Not only will this partnership secure the C Series and its industrial operations in Canada, the UK, and China, but we also bring new jobs to the US,"" Enders said. ""Airbus will benefit from strengthening its product portfolio in the high-volume single-aisle market, offering superior value to our airline customers worldwide.""

Airbus and Bombardier held talks in 2015 over a potential equity sale of the C Series, but the two parties could not come to a deal.

With no up-front cash required and the proven operational capabilities of the production aircraft, the C Series became much more enticing for Enders this time around.

Monday's deal is expected to close in the second half of 2018.

Boeing's complaint

On September 26, the US Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration called for a tariff of 219.63% on Bombardier's C Series jet. A week later, the ITA called for another 79.82% tariff. In total, all C Series jets entering the US could be subject to tariffs of 299.45%.

The action was taken in response to a complaint filed by Boeing in April regarding Delta Air Lines' order for 75 of the Canadian jets.

Boeing believes that its business was harmed by Bombardier using Canadian government subsidies to give Delta a price substantially below the cost of building the planes.

In its complaint, Boeing claims that Bombardier sold the CS100 for just $19.6 million. That's far less than the $33.2 million the Chicago-based aviation giant says it cost Bombardier to make the plane and a mere fraction of the CS100's $79.5 million sticker price. As a result, Boeing claims the Montreal-based company is dumping its product on the US market to the detriment of US aviation workers.

Bombardier and Delta have called the ITA's preliminary decision ""absurd."" Last week, on the airline's earnings call, Delta CEO Ed Bastian said his company would not pay the proposed tariffs.

Bombardier and Delta argue that the Boeing complaint is baseless because no US airplane maker offers a product comparable to the CS100's size and performance. (The C Series comes in 110-seat CS100 and 130-seat CS300 variants.)

In fact, Boeing hasn't included the pint-size 737-600 in its annual price list for more than half a decade. And its last true 100-seat jet, the 717-200, was discontinued in 2005. According to Delta, Boeing's only offer in response to the CS100 was for a fleet of secondhand Brazilian Embraer E190s it had taken as trade-ins from Air Canada.

Boeing counters by pointing out that Delta also agreed to an option for 50 planes that includes the possibility of converting to orders for the larger CS300, which is a competitor for Boeing's 737 MAX 7.

Bombardier

Even though the aircraft is assembled in Canada, its wings come from Northern Ireland and half of its components, including its engines, come from the US.

The dispute has entered the political realm as a result, with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and British Prime Minister Theresa May threatening punitive actions against Boeing.

To kill a budding rival

On the surface, Boeing's complaint is about protecting US manufacturing jobs. But dig a little deeper and it's clear that the endgame for Boeing is to stop Bombardier, its groundbreaking jet, and its commercial-airliner business from getting off the ground.

In seeking to end Bombardier's budding aspirations to become a third global aviation manufacturing powerhouse, Boeing is surely mindful of its failure to keep Airbus out of the US in the 1970s.

During that decade, the Toulouse-based Airbus was new to the game. The company's medium-range A300B wide-body airliner survived its early days by subsisting on orders from the European nations that invested in the company.

In the US, the wide-body market was dominated by Boeing's 747, the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, and the Lockheed L-1011 Tristar. Airbus was effectively frozen out of the US market.

That is until Frank Borman and Eastern Airlines took a chance on a lease for four A300Bs in 1978. Boeing didn't shut the door on the European interloper.

Borman believed the A300B to be more efficient than its US counterparts, and the four-plane deal marked the beginning of Airbus' rise to prominence in the US.

These days, Lockheed is out of the commercial-aviation business and McDonnell Douglas is part of Boeing. At the same time, Airbus is now half of a global aviation duopoly.

Boeing sees a lot of Airbus in Bombardier.

For years, the story around the Bombardier C Series program has been that of a critically acclaimed plane plagued by slow sales and development delays.

In 2015, Bombardier was forced to write down $4.4 billion. At the same time, the company took a $1 billion bailout from the Quebec government. In return, the provincial taxpayers took a 49.5% stake in the C Series.

At the heart of Boeing's complaint is a deal that was widely seen as the order that saved the Bombardier C Series program from demise.

Looking for a blockbuster sale to help build traction for the plane in the US, Bombardier went all in on a pitch to United Airlines. Sensing the new competition, Boeing gave United a whopping 70% discount on the 40 737-700s. While large airlines like United never pay list price, 70% off is the aviation equivalent of a Black Friday sale price.

Bombardier

In January 2016, United announced the sale of 40 737-700s followed by an order of another 25 of the same plane in March. (Oddly enough, United realized several months later that it actually didn't want any of these planes and converted them to four of the larger 737-800s and 61 737MAX jets.)





Finally, in April 2016, Bombardier struck pay dirt. Delta Air Lines ordered 75 CS100 airliners in a deal worth up to $5.6 billion. In addition, Bombardier and Delta agreed to an option for 50 additional jets.

With the Delta order, Bombardier not only found a US launch customer for the C Series but also had the blockbuster deal it needed to validate the attractiveness of aircraft to other prospective buyers. For Boeing, the strategy was simple. Undo the order that saved the C Series and keep it from gaining traction in its backyard.

But now that plan may have royally backfired on Boeing. Instead of keeping the Canadian jet grounded, Boeing all but pushed C Series into the arms of its greatest rival.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999475479125977}",neutral,0.9999475479125977,0

Airbus, Boeing’s main rival in the passenger jet business, said that it had provided false information to the State Department about its compliance with rules on arms sales overseas.

Airbus provided few details except to say that the inaccuracies related to American regulations on fees and commissions paid to sales agents.

The disclosure raised the prospect that corruption investigations involving the company in Europe, to do with the use of middlemen to pay bribes, could spread to the United States, which typically imposes much higher fines and stiffer court judgments. In an industry that relies heavily on ties with government, Airbus could also be at a disadvantage competing for contracts, or even be frozen out altogether.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9987272620201111}",negative,0.9987272620201111,-1

The European plane maker reached an unusual, no-cost deal with Canada’s Bombardier that sent Airbus shares up Tuesday, boosts both companies’ prospects in Asia and should save thousands of Bombardier jobs from Quebec to Northern Ireland.

It could also help Bombardier avoid heavy U.S. duties that had helped push the Canadian company near bankruptcy. The announcement late Monday gives Airbus a majority stake in Bombardier’s C Series passenger jets, and some C Series planes will now be built at an Airbus plant in Mobile, Alabama.

Boeing called it a questionable deal by two state-subsidized competitors.

It is a rare bright spot for Airbus, which is currently facing growing legal troubles stemming from corruption investigations in Britain, France and Austria. Airbus shares rose 2.8 percent in Tuesday in Paris before falling back slightly to €79 (U.S. $93).

Airbus CEO Tom Enders sought to assure investors that the Bombardier deal will save money for both companies by combining supply chains and production. He argued that it will improve the appeal for C Series jets, which have struggled for customers.

“This puts us in an excellent position ... with no cost, with no risk,” Enders said of the deal. He added it will allow Airbus to expand activities in China and “strengthen our global industrial footprint.”

While Airbus rejected a deal with Bombardier three years ago, Enders said Airbus is feeling more confident now in the C Series jets and its own ability to take on another production line.

The move comes after the U.S. Commerce Department imposed harsh duties on Bombardier, accusing it of selling C Series planes in America below cost and receiving government subsidies.

The Commerce Department announced it would impose an 80 percent duty on top of duties of nearly 220 percent. The case was a win for Boeing, which brought the complaint.

Airbus — in a long-running trade battle with Boeing — argues that the U.S. company receives illegal tax breaks that act like subsidies and hurt competition.

Officials and unions in Northern Ireland cautiously welcomed the Airbus-Bombardier deal. Bombardier employs more than 4,000 people at its Belfast factories and will deliver 125 new C Series jets to Delta Air Lines next year.

Davy Thompson, regional officer of the Unite union, called it a “welcome development — one that gives breathing space to the C Series itself and which we anticipate should safeguard the future of C Series production jobs in Belfast for the foreseeable future.”

However, Ross Murdoch of union GMB warned that “this deal is liable to further scrutiny from the U.S. administration that may see it as an attempt to dodge their trade tariffs. ... GMB hopes both Bombardier and Airbus have taken cast iron legal advice to ensure they don’t get rid of one legal challenge only to open themselves up to another.”

The Airbus acquisition will be subject to Canadian government review. Airbus will acquire a 50.01 percent interest in C Series Aircraft Limited Partnership, which manufactures and sells the plane. It will not pay anything for the stake, a recognition that the unit will see sales increase merely by virtue of being part of the Airbus group.

Bombardier will own 31 percent, and the Quebec government’s investment agency will hold 19 percent.

Airbus is not assuming any debt as part of the deal and it has an option to buy out Bombardier’s ownership after seven-and-a-half years and the Quebec government’s ownership in 2023.

Airbus A380: a decade of commercial flight - Aviation Week,"Wed, 25 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9haXItdHJhbnNwb3J0L2FpcnBvcnRzLW5ldHdvcmtzL2FpcmJ1cy1hMzgwLWRlY2FkZS1jb21tZXJjaWFsLWZsaWdodNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On 25 October 2007, Singapore Airlines flight SQ380 touched down on time at Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport after a seven-hour journey from Singapore.

It was a damp afternoon in the Australian city, but that failed to deter hundreds of airport staff and aviation enthusiasts from lining the fences of the airport to witness history being made. For this was no ordinary flight – it marked the inaugural Airbus A380 commercial service.

Passengers on board ranged from a ten-month old boy to a 91-year-old Singaporean man, with tickets for the maiden flight costing between $560 and $100,380 after being sold through an online auction that raised more than $1.2m for charity.

Those lucky enough to have a first-class seat enjoyed the luxury of double beds and 23-inch television screen, while spectators on the ground marvelled at the sheer size of the 72.7-metre long aircraft with its 79.8-metre wingspan.

The successful first commercial flight of the double-decker plane, a milestone in civil aviation, remains one of the high points in the life of the A380 after a series of production delays and a massive overspend by European manufacturer Airbus that led to about 10,000 job losses.

Airbus officially launched the design and development programme for the marquee aircraft, intended to provide competition to Boeing's dominance of the skies, 13 years earlier in June 1994 but it took until 2005 for the first flight to take place.

Initial production of the A380 was then hindered by delays attributed to the 530km of wiring in each aircraft, forcing deliveries to be postponed for two years.

In total, Airbus has spent about $25bn to develop the A380 and to date has secured 317 net orders from 18 customers, including one leasing company. A total of 216 have so far been delivered to 13 operators.

Emirates, the world’s largest A380 operator, is set to receive its milestone 100th A380 on 3 November 2017 and president Sir Tim Clark remains one of the aircraft’s biggest fans. The airline’s inaugural A380 flight was in 2008 and since then it has carried more than 80 million passengers on its fleet of superjumbos.

“The A380 has been, and continues to be hugely popular among our customers, many of whom deliberately plan their travel so that they can fly on it,” he says.

“Our frequent flyers will have noticed countless improvements on board over the years, ranging from minor updates such as the addition of in-seat USB and HDMI ports, to bigger cabin overhauls.” Such overhauls have included relocating overhead luggage bins and introducing better inflight entertainment systems.

However, despite the popularity of the A380 from passengers, the future of the giant four-engine aircraft remains uncertain. Although Emirates is a strong proponent, rocky market conditions means it is unlikely to place further large orders anytime soon.

Speaking at World Routes 2017 in Barcelona, International Airlines Group chief executive Willie Walsh admitted that British Airways was not in the market for any new A380s, while last December Iran Air downsized a $25bn order for 118 Airbus jets to 100 – none of which are now A380s.

In August this year it also emerged that 9V-SKA – the first A380 to enter commercial service – was being returned by Singapore Airlines to lessor Dr Peters Group. The same carrier this week confirmed it has picked Boeing over Airbus for the next stage of its fleet renewal after signing a firm order for 20 777-9s and 19 787-10s.

In fact Airbus has not won a new A380 order from any airline for more than two years and does not expect any for the rest of this year. In July, the manufacturer revealed that production would fall from 15 this year to 12 in 2018 and just eight in 2019.

Airbus maintains that the A380 is an essential part of the solution to sustainable growth, saying it can alleviate traffic congestion at busy airports by transporting more passengers with fewer flights, more efficiently and at much lower cost.

In a bid to resuscitate sales, it recently unveiled plans to upgrade the A380, claiming the A380plus version can cut costs for airlines by 13 per cent per seat. Among the key features us a new cabin layout that has capacity for an additional 80 seats, meaning the average seat count would move from 497 to 575 in four classes.

However, only time will tell if the move will help to secure the future of the much-loved A380.

From Texas to Thailand: RTA Lakotas enter service without a hitch - Airbus,"Tue, 24 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vbmV3cy8yMDE3LTEwLWZyb20tdGV4YXMtdG8tdGhhaWxhbmQtcnRhLWxha290YXMtZW50ZXItc2VydmljZS13aXRob3V0LWEtaGl0Y2jSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In 2014, the Royal Thai Army acquired six UH-72A Lakota helicopters from Airbus Group through the US’s foreign military sales programme. After receiving training and in-country support, the Lakotas’ first two years in operation have gone smoothly, an example of hard work and dedicated personnel.

The Royal Thai Army (RTA) is Thailand’s largest military branch. In addition to conventional military undertakings, its airborne arm is responsible for emergency medical services (EMS), evacuation, reconnaissance and utility services. Its rotorcraft fleet comprises a variety of makes, many of which – as in the case of its Vietnam-era Huey helicopters – are in need of replacement.

To this end, the RTA acquired six new Lakota helicopters from Airbus’ North American division, Airbus Helicopters, Inc., in 2014. For the army’s pilots, like Captain Pongsaton, the commander of the RTA who has experience on the older helicopters, the new aircraft offer a distinct advantage. “The Lakota is very easy to fly. We mainly fly utility, transporting equipment to the mountains or jungle, and we need to take off in confined areas. The Lakota’s instruments and autopilot systems help us avoid obstacles.”

The RTA’s purchase of the Lakotas came with a unique support set-up: five weeks of training for pilots and maintenance personnel at the division’s headquarters in Grand Prairie, Texas, followed by support in the form of one field service and one logistics representative in Thailand.

“The RTA saw that in-country support was needed because it was the first time they had acquired this type of helicopter,” says Chong Eu Chuah, the contractor field service representative (CFSR) from Airbus. “My role is part of Airbus’ support guarantee to ensure a smooth entry into service for the Lakotas in Thailand.”

Originally a technician at Airbus Singapore, Chauh trained for a month in Texas along with Chong Siew Fwai, the contractor logistics service rep (CLSR). They joined a group of six RTA pilots and ten technicians who would complete theory and simulator instruction, as well as flight training on the UH-72A. In all, 18 pilots and 30 technicians trained through the programme. “We got to know our future colleagues well, as well as setting up lines of communication,” says Chuah. “By the time the aircraft arrived in-country we were ready to assume our duties.”

In Thailand, Chuah’s responsibilities vary from troubleshooting and on-the-job training, to supporting maintenance or supplying technical assistance at one of the RTA’s five bases – Phitsanulok, Lopburi, Roi Et, Bangkok, and Nakkon Si Thammarat. “For troubleshooting, I normally drive to the sites,” he says. “If it is too far (Nakhon Si Thammarat is 900 km from Lopburi), I travel by commercial airlines. It is a tiring job but we show commitment to our customer.”

Speaking for the RTA’s technical staff, one mechanic offered the comment, “The RTA’s missions cannot be carried out if we don’t have perfect maintenance and a great contribution from the US Army and Airbus Helicopters in sending someone who is an expert.”

On the logistics side, Chong Siew Fwai set up a warehouse and inventory of Lakota spares, equipment and tools. Based in Bangkok, he handles purchase orders, equipment loans, parts shipments, and consults on nearly all logistics issues that come up with the new Lakotas.

The entry into service was not without a snag. “During the initial entry into service, we faced some avionics problems, possibly due to humidity during the sea journey from the USA coupled with the rainy season in Thailand,” says Chuah. However, with time, his help has shifted from problem-solving to supplying hand’s on – or even remote – training. “As the mechanics gain more experience, I do not travel to the sites as often. I can provide instructions, drawings, photos and video through smartphone.”

During their two years in operation, the RTA’s Lakotas have seen an availability rate of 100% when the aircraft are not scheduled for maintenance. “We selected the Lakota for use as a utility helicopter,” says one pilot, speaking on behalf of his colleagues. “[We] like the UH-72A because it is large, comfortable and easy to fly. It’s almost too powerful when hovering into a nose wind and very stable with low vibration.”

Behind the Lakotas’ success is a team of dedicated people. “Chong Siew Fwai and I stayed on in Grand Prairie after the type course training to meet key personnel at Airbus in the technical support and logistics departments,” says Chuah. “It is easier to help someone you know than a total stranger. I believe these are the reasons for the Lakotas’ smooth entry into service.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999988317489624}",neutral,0.999988317489624,0

The deal announced on Monday gives Airbus a majority stake in Bombardier's troubled CSeries jetliner programme, securing the plane's future and giving the Canadian firm a possible way out of a damaging trade dispute with Boeing, in which the U.S. Commerce Department has threatened to impose a 300 percent import duties.

Boeing said that the announced deal has no effect on the pending U.S. Department of Commerce proceedings. ""Any duties finally levied against the C-Series... will have to be paid on any imported C-Series airplane or part, or it will not be permitted into the country,"" Michael Luttig, Boeing's general counsel, said in a statement. Investors cheered the winners of the deal that is set to shake up the $125 billion a year market for large jets. Bombardier shares jumped 15.7 percent on Tuesday, while shares in Toulouse, France-based Airbus rose 4.8 percent. The transaction would give Airbus a 50.01 percent stake in an entity recently carved out of Bombardier to produce and market the CSeries, four years after it first flew with a goal to enter the large jets market. But in a move emblematic of the huge risks of aerospace competition, Bombardier will get just one dollar for the majority stake in exchange for Airbus's purchasing and marketing power to support an aircraft that has won fans for its fuel efficiency but had not secured a new order in 18 months for the 110-130 seat plane due to doubts over its future. Bombardier's strategy of performing final assembly in Alabama might allow the CSeries to avoid duties because the trade case targets partially and fully-assembled aircraft, said U.S. international trade lawyer William Perry. Bombardier and Airbus could argue they are importing parts, like the wing from Northern Ireland, to be assembled in the United States. ""That may be the loophole Bombardier is hoping to use,"" he said by phone.

'One dollar deal'

In reality, the terms of the deal mean Bombardier could pay Airbus to take over by agreeing to underwrite $700 million of risks related to cost overruns in coming years. ""It's an unexpected move by Airbus but indicates they see good market potential for the CSeries. Neither they nor Boeing currently offer an aircraft in the regional jet market,"" said aerospace consultant John Strickland of JLS Consulting. The deal is similar to one that Airbus walked away from in 2015 when it decided the investment in a plane that had not yet entered service was too risky - with one major difference: that some of the jets will be produced in the United States. That could change the power balance in Bombardier's costly trade dispute with Boeing, though it is not the main reason why the two former rivals have come together, executives said. ""Assembly in the U.S. can resolve the (tariff) issue because it then becomes a domestic product,"" Bombardier's chief executive, Alain Bellemare, told reporters at Airbus's headquarters in Toulouse. Airbus CEO Tom Enders hailed the tie-up as ""a win for Canada ... a win for the UK,"" referring to Bombardier's wing-making factory in Northern Ireland whose future had been threatened by the distant trade war. He said it would also create new U.S. jobs. The deal appeared to catch Boeing off guard. Locked in a separate 13-year trade dispute with Airbus, Boeing on Monday called it a ""questionable deal"" between two of its subsidized competitors.

Canadian approval

Bellemare said he hoped the deal would be approved within six to 12 months. Canadian Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains, who must officially decide whether to green-light the deal, said it looked like ""Bombardier's new proposed partnership ... would help position the CSeries for success"". Bombardier said the partnership should more than double the value of the CSeries program.

While it will lose control of a project developed at a cost of $6 billion, the deal gives the CSeries improved economies of scale and a better sales network. For Airbus, the deal strengthens the bottom end of its narrowbody portfolio after poor sales of its own A319 model and expands its global footprint, potentially opening up further deals in other sectors in Canada. Tony Webber, a former chief economist at Qantas, said the CSeries could complement Airbus's existing single-aisle models. Bellemare said the deal was expected to close in the second half of 2018. ""We're doing this deal here not because of this Boeing petition. We are doing this deal because it is the right strategic move for Bombardier,"" he said, referring to Boeing's complaint that the Canadian firm received illegal subsidies and dumped CSeries planes at ""absurdly low"" prices.

No job losses

Bombardier said the deal would not result in job losses and would keep the head office in Montreal. Unions said the deal could benefit workers. The Boeing-Bombardier dispute has snowballed into a bigger multilateral trade dispute, with British Prime Minister Theresa May asking U.S. President Donald Trump to intervene to save British jobs. Bombardier is the largest manufacturing employer in Northern Ireland and May's Conservatives rely on the support of the small Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) party for their majority in parliament. Business Secretary Greg Clark said Britain would work closely with the planemakers, while the DUP said the agreement was ""incredibly significant news"" for Belfast.

Airbus Helicopters and Southern Vietnam Helicopter Corporation celebrate 30 years of collaboration - Airbus,"Wed, 04 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNy0xMC1haXJidXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlcnMtYW5kLXNvdXRoZXJuLXZpZXRuYW0taGVsaWNvcHRlci1jb3Jwb3JhdGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"London, Airbus Helicopters has presented VNH South with an award celebrating its 30 years of flying Airbus helicopters in offshore missions.

“We are honoured to recognize VNH South for their dedication and to highlight our longstanding partnership,” said Guillaume Faury, President and CEO of Airbus Helicopters. “They have placed their trust in a variety of our helicopters for more than three decades, and we commend their unwavering commitment not only to their operations but to the entire oil & gas community.”

VNH South became Vietnam’s very first helicopter operator when it began in 1986 with a Puma. Its reputation began to grow, particularly within Vietnam’s burgeoning oil & gas industry, and the company is now one of the leading helicopter service providers in South East Asia, operating four AS332 L2s, two H155s, and four H225s.

“Airbus Helicopters and VNH South have always worked closely together to support safe and continued offshore operations in our region, and we are pleased to celebrate this milestone,” said Capt. Kieu Dang Hung, Director of VNH South. “We are proud to be a trusted partner of Airbus Helicopters and we look forward to advancing this partnership for many years to come.”

Chief among VNHS’s achievements is 30 years of safety in offshore oil and gas flights, accumulating more than 270,000 flight hours, many of which aboard their H225 fleet.

“VNHS flies to offshore installations located 200 to 240 nautical miles from the base,” explained Capt. Hung. “The H225’s payload is good, especially for long distances and the hot climate. Our pilots consider it a user-friendly machine.”

Initially based at Vung Tau Airport, VNHS has expanded its activities to three additional bases and multiple mission segments, including aerial survey and photography services, medical evacuation and search and rescue (SAR) services, as well as fire-fighting and sling load work.

VNHS is closely supported by Airbus, which provides the operator with technical assistance, customer support and maintenance services, both on-site and at Airbus’ customer centres in the region.

Turkey picks Airbus for Turksat 5A and 5B - SpaceNews,"Wed, 11 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS90dXJrZXktcGlja3MtYWlyYnVzLWZvci10dXJrc2F0LTVhLWFuZC01Yi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — Turkish telecommunications satellite operator Turksat has selected Airbus Defence and Space for the construction of two long-awaited geostationary satellites.

Ahmet Arslan, Turkey’s minister of transport, maritime and communications, told the country’s state-run media outlet the Anadolu Agency Oct. 6 that contract negotiations are underway with Airbus for Turksat 5A and Turksat 5B, with discussions expected to conclude by the end of the month.

Airbus’ offer bested those of California-based Space Systems Loral and Japanese manufacturer Mitsubishi Electric, the latter of which built Turksat’s two most recent satellites Turksat 4A and 4B.

“All three were well qualified,” Arslan said. “At the end of the talks, Airbus gave the most suitable bid in terms of financial and domestic contribution.”

Turksat is racing the clock against the expiration of Ku-band spectrum rights from the United Nations’ International Telecommunication Union, making production time for Turksat 5A and 5B a major criteria. Cenk Sen, Turksat’s chief executive, said during World Satellite Business Week in Paris in September that certain Turksat-held Ku-band orbital rights expire July 2021.

Turksat is getting a later start on its next satellites than it expected. Arslan said in August 2016 that a manufacturing contract for Turksat 5A and 5B would be awarded that September or October, which didn’t happen.

Based on that 2016 schedule, Turkey hoped to have Turksat 5A in orbit by the end of 2018 at 31 degrees east, and Turksat 5B at 42 degrees east in 2019.

Turksat’s Airbus announcement, posted Oct. 10, said Turksat 5A should be in orbit by 2020, followed by Turksat 5B in 2021.

‘We will now negotiate prices with them,” Arslan said. “Our aim is to finish price negotiations by the end of this month, sign the contract and immediately start the manufacturing of these satellites.”

A major stipulation for Turksat-5A is that 25 percent of the satellite be built in Turkey. The country’s first fully domestic satellite, Turksat-6A, entered production in 2015 and is expected to launch in 2020

Sen said last month that domestic satellite manufacturing should give Turkey a technological edge, provide a desired national security capability and would create selling opportunities to neighboring countries with whom Turkey has history.

Arslan said Turkey also has an interest in Q-band, a higher frequency spectrum of interest to the satellite industry, but sparsely used. Fleet operator Eutelsat Communications of Paris and U.S. manufacturer Space Systems Loral tested Q-band transmissions in 2016 on Eutelsat 65 West A satellite in the first half of 2016 to evaluate its potential for terabit-level broadband. Arslan said Turkey will be one of the first countries to use the higher frequency spectrum for satellite telecommunications.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999993085861206}",neutral,0.999993085861206,0
The Airbus Bombardier C Series deal faces big challenges - Business Insider,"Thu, 26 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWJvbWJhcmRpZXItYy1zZXJpZXMtZGVhbC1jaGFsbGVuZ2VzLTIwMTctMTDSAVZodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1ib21iYXJkaWVyLWMtc2VyaWVzLWRlYWwtY2hhbGxlbmdlcy0yMDE3LTEwP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has acquired a 50.01% equity stake in the Bombardier C Series program.

Challenges include the C Series as an orphan in the Airbus lineup.

Other problems could be trade tariffs levied by the US Department of Commerce.

Airbus shocked the aviation world with the acquisition of Bombardier's prized C Series airliner program. The deal, announced Monday, saw Airbus take a 50.01% equity stake in the program with zero upfront cash investment.

Airbus is expected to acquire the entire C Series program within five years.

The general reaction among industry observers was that Airbus has pulled off the deal of the century.

The union certainly offers a lot of upside for both parties. Bombardier's C Series gains access to Airbus' procurement program, sales, and marketing expertise, as well as its customer-support network. At the same time, the Airbus tie-up provided a crucial lifeline for Bombardier when the future of the C Series program seemed to be in jeopardy.

For Airbus, it just got its hands on a multibillion-dollar jetliner program pretty much for free.

Unfortunately, a successful future for the Airbus-Bombardier union is far from certain. There are several factors that could cause big problems for the deal.

The problems of being an orphan

A major part of the deal will see the C Series included in the Airbus sales operation. For both Airbus and Boeing, it is important to be able to market a family of aircraft. Unfortunately, the C Series will be a stand-alone or orphan in the Airbus lineup, a hurdle it and Bombardier will have to overcome.

""We have the 737MAX 7,-8,-9, and -10. We have a family,"" Dinesh Keskar, Boeing's senior vice president of sales for the Asia Pacific and India, told Business Insider. ""You talk to others and they'll tell you that family has a lot of value.""

For Boeing, this means the 737 MAX comes in four distinct variants capable of efficiently carrying anywhere from 138 to 204 passengers. As a result, a family of planes allows airlines to take advantage of the synergies created by filling a wide variety of needs using the same set of pilots, mechanics, and spare parts.

In addition, it allows Boeing to incorporate clauses into sales agreements that allow customers to switch to larger or smaller models should market conditions change.

""Typically, most deals are centered around a single model like the 737MAX 8,"" Keskar said. ""But to have the comfort in the contract to say they can move up to the -9 or -10 or down to a -7 is a very big deal for the airline board and CEO.""

""Does this sway the deal? Maybe not, but does it make a significant impact in their thinking? Absolutely,"" the Boeing executive added.

For Airbus, its A320 family of planes has been one of the most successful in aviation history. But with the C Series in the fold, the smaller end of the single-aisle Airbus lineup will consist of the 110-seat CS100 and the 130-seat CS300 while the larger end of the spectrum will be the 240-seat A321neo.

As great as the C Series and the A321neo may be as individual aircraft, they can't deliver the same type of synergies as aircraft from the same family. After all, the C Series and the A320 series will remain aircraft designed and built by two separate companies with completely disparate design and engineering philosophies.

""The CSeries is a great complement to the current Airbus lineup,"" an Airbus spokesman said in a statement sent to Business Insider. ""Filling a market need for 100-150 passenger single-aisle jets that Bombardier estimates at 6,000 aircraft over the next 20 years.""

This is something Boeing itself dealt with some more than a decade ago.

Following a 1997 merger with McDonnell-Douglas in 1997, Boeing was left with the task of selling the defunct brand's final product, the MD-95.

Boeing went to great lengths to incorporate it into the company's lineup including renaming it the 717-200. Unfortunately, Boeing was forced to pull the plug on the project in 2006 after just eight in production and 156 aircraft sold.

According to Keskar, one of contributing factors to the 717's demise was that it was an orphan in Boeing's lineup. Incidentally, the people who bought aircraft remain extremely happy with it and are looking to acquire more of them on the secondhand market.

Boeing and tariff challenges

And then there are the potential tariffs. As part of the deal, production of US-bound C Series jets will move from Montreal, Canada, to the Airbus plant in Mobile, Alabama.

Airbus and Bombardier believe this is a valid workaround to bypass any potential import tariffs levied by the US Department of Commerce. Over the past few weeks, the DOC has proposed that a 299.45% tariffs be added to every C Series jet imported into the US. This comes as a result of a Boeing complaint that alleges Bombardier used Canadian government subsidies to sell Delta 75 C Series jets at ""absurdly low"" prices.

On its latest earnings call, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg made it clear that his company's complaint was based on its belief that Bombardier had an unfair advantage.

""These are not actions targeted at customers or countries, these are matters of fair trade,"" Muilenburg told Business Insider. ""We are happy to compete; we just want everyone to play by the same rules.""

However, it is also possible the Department of Commerce could see the production shift to Mobile as a means to circumvent the tariffs. This could result in additional penalties levied on the C Series.

""We can’t speculate on the future actions of other parties,"" Airbus said. ""But it’s important to note that our investment in the CSeries is driven by a global market demand for this very competitive aircraft, and not related to anyone order or customer.""

Delta CEO Ed Bastian has made it clear that his airline wants the planes but will not pay any tariffs. While they are willing to wait for the planes, it's unclear how long they are willing to hold tight.

Since the Airbus-Bombardier C Series deal isn't expected to close until the second half of 2018, it's conceivable Delta may have to wait for years. In fact, even without the specter of additional import taxes, it could be 2019 or 2020 before Delta sees its first planes.

The US government will make a final decision on the tariffs early next year.

With great risk, there's also great potential. For Airbus and Bombardier, the joining of forces on the C Series program will undoubtedly be a company-changing experience. It's simply too early to tell if it's for better or for worse.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.5537894368171692}",negative,0.5537894368171692,-1
What has Airbus got in the CSeries? - Leeham News and Analysis,"Wed, 18 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vbGVlaGFtbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNy8xMC8xOC9haXJidXMtZ290LWNzZXJpZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Bjorn Fehrm

October 18, 2017, ©. Leeham Co: Bombardier and Airbus changed the airliner landscape yesterday. Analysts say it’s the largest industry change since Boeing bought McDonnell Douglas in 1997.

So, what has Airbus bought for no money? A me-too, or a world-beater?

The me-too that grew

CSeries was developed as a step-up regional airliner from Bombardier’s CRJ series. It started more as a me-too than a world-beater. Gradually the design grew in capability.

In the end, the CSeries became more than a step-up regional. The present CSeries transports 100 to 150 passengers on routes of up to 3,300nm. These are flights lasting over seven hours.

And it flies these routes with better passenger comfort than a Boeing 737 MAX or Airbus A320neo.

These are non-regional routes flown with non-regional comfort levels by a non-regional aircraft.

So, we need to change the yardstick from regional to mainline. Now defined as mainline, 130 to 240 passengers, covering 3,000nm routes (which is what you need for a transcontinental flight in the USA).

The competition is then Airbus A320neo line and Boeing’s 737 MAX series.

Embraer’s E-jet doesn’t qualify in this segment. It’s a regional airliner, designed to carry 75 to 130 passengers and on routes of less than 2,500nm.

Airbus’ versus Boeing’s single aisle

With the CSeries, Airbus now covers the range from 100 to 240 seats with its single aisle products. And it does this with four models. The CS100 for the 100-120 seat segment, the CS300 for 120-150 seats, A320neo for 150 to 180 seats and finally A321neo for 180 to 240 seats.

We can skip the A319neo. With 20 orders in total, whereof 18 from Frontier airlines, it’s an artifact in the market of single aisles.

Of the range, the CS100 and CS300 are state of the art. They are clean sheet designs, created after 2008. The A320 stems from 1988, pepped up with upgraded engines and over the next year, upgraded cabin (Airbus Airspace).

The Boeing 737 MAX covers the range from 140 seats to 230 seats. The 737 MAX 7 was recently increased in size (it’s now a chopped MAX 8) and no longer covers below 140 seats efficiently.

The new MAX 7 is a 140 to 160 seater, followed by the MAX 8 covering 160 to 189 seats (after which it’s exit limited). Finally, the MAX 10 covers 180 to 230 seats (we can forget the MAX 9; it has no longer a place in the line-up–this is taken by the MAX 10. And the MAX 8200 is a special for Ryanair).

Neither of the 737s are state of the art. In fact, they are warmed over four times: the original -100/200 series to Classic, Classic to NG and finally NG to MAX. A lot of the technology stays the same at each makeover.

And this is a positive when it comes to maintenance costs, but not for the pilots. They are still banging their head against a narrow cockpit roof which stems from the 727. As does the sound level and flight controls.

Technology

The base design of the 737 MAX is 20 years older than the A320. And it’s a whopping 40 years older than the CSeries. It has point-to-point Avionics versus Ethernet connected IMA (Integrated Modular Avionics) that run Avionics functions in software.

It has steel wires, versus the best Fly-By-Wire in the market. The MAX cockpit and flight controls work as designed, but are light-years from the cockpit and flight controls of the CSeries. The A320neo cockpit and flight controls are somewhere in between.

For the systems, it’s the same: 1960 technologies versus 40 years younger tech. There is simply no comparison. Once again the A320 is somewhere in between.

All have the new generation of engines. The MAX the CFM LEAP, the CSeries the Pratt & Whitney GTF and you can have the A320neo with either. The CSeries GTF has an in-service issue level the same as the LEAP, nothing to worry about.

The A320neo GTF is the variant that got to market too early. It has problems that should have been caught in flight testing. But there wasn’t enough of it. Time was up, and an unmatured variant spoiled the Pratt reputation once again.

The cabins

The area which has changed the most for the MAX is the cabin. It now sports an excellent Sky Interior. It compensates for a narrower fuselage compared with an A320neo. The narrower cabin seats in the MAX are compensated by the roomier feeling of the Sky Interior.

But the difference to the CSeries is another half inch on top of the A320 difference for the normal seats and another inch for the middle seat in the triple (CSeries seats are 18.5 and 19 inches wide, A320 18 inches and MAX 17 inches).

In an equally airy cabin design to the MAX, it makes a difference.

Operational use

The 737 MAX gives the A320neo a match on operational reliability and can beat the A320neo on maintenance costs. But the CSeries is designed to be better than both on maintenance costs. It uses modern technology, Carbon Fiber structures and Alu-Lithium hull, to lower the maintenance costs below the MAX.

The danger when new technology is introduced is that it hits initial reliability. Early problems need a weeding out period. The flight and maintenance crews need to learn what are fault indications they can ignore and those they can’t.

For the 737 and A320, the crews are well down this path at least for the ceo and NG generations. But the CSeries is a new aircraft.

The CSeries has bucked the trend of a problematic first introduction. Initial operational experience has been good. In fact, the CSeries will probably replace the Boeing 777 as the most pain-free jet airliner introduction.

Aircraft economics

We will compare the aircraft’s economics tomorrow. A319neo versus 737 MAX 7 and CS300.

Why Airbus?

Why did the high tech CSeries end up at Airbus? Boeing would have had more use for a modern complement to a 737 on its fourth refresh. Guess Boeing is asking itself this question.

CityAirbus demonstrator passes major propulsion testing milestone - Airbus,"Tue, 03 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNy0xMC1jaXR5YWlyYnVzLWRlbW9uc3RyYXRvci1wYXNzZXMtbWFqb3ItcHJvcHVsc2lvbi10ZXN0aW5nLW1pbGVzdG9uZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Project on track for maiden flight in 2018

London, Airbus Helicopters has recently completed the first full-scale testing for the propeller-and-duct system of the CityAirbus demonstrator – a multi-passenger, self-piloted electric vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) vehicle designed for urban air mobility. During this successful testing phase, the CityAirbus team thoroughly checked the individual performance of the system, powered by Siemens electrical propulsion units.

CityAirbus is a battery-powered air vehicle able to vertically take off and land. It is designed to carry up to four passengers over congested megacities to important destinations such as airports or train stations in a fast, affordable and environmentally friendly way. The innovative four-ducted propeller configuration significantly contributes to safety and low acoustic footprint.

“We now have a better understanding of the performance of CityAirbus’ innovative electric propulsion system, which we will continue to mature through rigorous testing while beginning the assembly of the full-scale CityAirbus flight demonstrator” says Marius Bebesel, CityAirbus chief engineer.

Tests of the fully integrated drivetrain, with 8 propellers and 8 specially designed Siemens SP200D (100kW operating power, direct-drive) drivetrains with exceptional torque to weight ratio are expected shortly.

The full-scale demonstrator will be tested on ground initially. In the first half of the coming year the development team expects to reach the “power on” milestone, meaning that all motors and electric systems will be switched on for the first time. The first flight is scheduled for the end of 2018. In the beginning, the test aircraft will be remotely piloted, later on a test pilot will be on board.

CityAirbus will be designed to carry up to four passengers on fixed routes with a cruising speed of 120 km/h. It will be initially operated by a pilot to ease certification and public acceptance, paving the way to future fully-autonomous operations.

Q&A | Airbus' Oliver Juckenhöfel gung-ho on Deep Space Gateway - SpaceNews,"Tue, 24 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9xYS1haXJidXMtb2xpdmVyLWp1Y2tlbmhvZmVsLWd1bmctaG8tb24tZGVlcC1zcGFjZS1nYXRld2F5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As the head of the Airbus space site in Bremen, Germany, Oliver Juckenhöfel leads a workforce of 1,000 people responsible for the bulk of the European aerospace giant’s human spaceflight and upper stage work.

Juckenhöfel’s team is busy finishing assembly of the Orion Service Module, the primary power and propulsion element of NASA’s deep space exploration capsule currently slated to perform its first lunar roundtrip — without crew onboard — sometime in 2019. As that work wraps up, Juckenhöfel and his team have already started work on its successor, which will return humans to lunar orbit.

Juckenhöfel, who joined Airbus in 2008 and took over the Bremen site last November, said he’s excited about the Deep Space Gateway, NASA’s concept for a permanent space station in lunar orbit. Airbus, as Juckenhöfel sees it, would be an indispensable contributor to the Deep Space Gateway, assuming it moves from concept to a bona fide program with European Space Agency involvement.

Juckenhöfel spoke with SpaceNews ahead of Space Tech Expo Europe in Bremen Oct. 24-26.

Q. The Orion Service Module has passed its critical design review and delivery of the flight unit to NASA is expected next year. How is the work progressing?

A: We are in the production phase. We have the vehicle in a clean room and it already looks like a spacecraft. We are beyond the point where we are talking about bits and pieces.

Components are coming from our partners in Europe but also in the U.S. and we are completing the service module step by step.

We hope to hand the craft over to NASA as soon as possible. We need to have contingency for some qualification topics and investigation of recent test results.

NASA is expected to disclose the committed launch date to the U.S. Congress very soon. We don’t know it yet. But what we know is that by the summer 2018, our folks will be in Florida to continue with the integration of the overall vehicle at the Kennedy Space Center.

This is the first time we are building something that will fly beyond the moon and there are many challenges. The service module is 50 percent of the spacecraft. The crew module is being made by Lockheed Martin but if we don’t deliver our bit, there will be no spacecraft.

Q. In February, you signed a contract with ESA to build a second module — one that will be part of the mission that will take astronauts to the moon and back. Do you expect any redesign between the first and second mission?

A. We have already started manufacturing the second module and our industrial partners have been contracted to supply the components. We don’t plan any significant changes

For us, it’s a seamless transition. We are very happy that the agencies were ready to take this on already in the spring because that allows us to keep our whole industry supply base stable. Our suppliers move automatically from [Exploration Mission]-1 to EM-2.

The first module was already designed as if it was to support a human crew and NASA said in its assessment it would be confident to send people up in it already in the first mission. The service module provides propulsion, which we would need if we want to change the direction of the spacecraft but also for the return back to Earth. The service module also provides consumables for the astronauts, such as water, and electrical power via solar arrays.

There may be a few areas where we would need to make small changes but those will be local modifications; they will not affect the overall design. We already know about some areas that we could improve to further increase safety and reliability.

We expect to have a similar learning curve as we had with the [Automated Transfer Vehicle for ISS]. When you do something for the first time, you are bound to find issues that must be changed. We expect to make changes in the system that will be supplying astronauts with consumables. This is something that will not be fully tested in the first mission because there will be no consumers aboard.

Q. When do you expect to deliver the second Orion Service Module?

A. We are currently planning to deliver one of these service modules per year so when we have delivered the first one, about a year later we will deliver the second one. That is the cadence that we are preparing for. Then we have to see from the experimentation on system level when the Orion is fully integrated whether there will be any feedback. I would say we are probably taking some contingency with this one per year but even with that we are still forecasting the delivery of the second one no more than a year and a half after the first. This is really given by the integration time of the vehicle and the manufacturing time of components on the supplier side.

Q. Do you have any idea what will happen beyond the second mission?

A. We know already from the overall mission planning that is not yet fully approved, from the information that we are getting from the agencies, that already on the third flight we see what they call co-manifested payloads. These co-manifested payloads will be the first elements of the Deep Space Gateway.

Orion is like a shuttle; it’s shuttling between Earth and Moon and if you shuttle between Earth and Moon, you must fly somewhere. If the Orion is the taxi, the Deep Space Gateway will be the house or the shelter where you fly to do something.

That’s why the agencies already have a very detailed plan where they are talking about the build-up and the configuration of the Deep Space Gateway.

They want to use the launch capacity of NASA’s Space Launch System as early as possible to bring elements of the Deep Space Gateway up to the lunar environment.

If things go right, we might see already with the second flight, with the first crewed flight, some modules of the Deep Space Gateway being carried to the lunar orbit.

Q. Where else do you see the role of Airbus in the development of permanent human presence around the moon?

A. We hope we will be able to utilize the experience we have gained when developing and operating Europe’s Columbus module on the International Space Station. We believe that this could be another potential European contribution.

We also hope that our electric-propulsion technology could come handy. We have recently broken a record for the fastest orbit-raising of the heaviest all-electric geostationary satellite to date.

We have a lot of competence within the group, where we believe we can contribute and we are currently supporting ESA in discussions with other agencies about who could contribute what.

It’s not only NASA. JAXA, Roscosmos and the Canadian Space Agency want to contribute as well.

The agencies are approaching it in a very collaborative way, just as they approached the International Space Station.

For Airbus, the Deep Space Gateway and any orbital infrastructure is of very high interest because we believe that this is going to be the place where we are going to do our future business and future research. It’s a very vital part of our vision and our roadmaps and there is quite a lot where we think that Airbus can contribute. But of course we have to respect, as usual in this business, how much the institutions in Europe, how much the governments in Europe, will want to invest. We expect there will be some major decisions taking place at the next ESA ministerial conference in 2019.

Q. Last year, Airbus announced plans to attach Bartolomeo, an external platform for commercial experiments, to the station’s Columbus module. Do you see a lot of potential in commercial operations at ISS?

A. We expect to launch Bartolomeo in 2018. The interest that we have seen is quite amazing. We are in discussions with the newly founded Australian Space Agency, private companies, and small start-ups that want to test their technology at the ISS. The demand seems to be huge.

Customers can already book flight tickets with us and with the help of space agencies we will transport their payload to the ISS. We will also provide services to them in terms of access and monitoring what their technology or equipment is doing.

We see this as the first step to truly democratizing access to space. It will enable countries and companies that today don’t have access to the space station, because they are not member states, to have access on commercial basis.

Commercialization of the space station is an important point on our agenda. The agencies are driving towards deep space and we are seeing that they are leaving the low Earth orbit behind.

We believe that the space station will be gradually converted into something that is operated under more industrial responsibility, being it private investments or commercial business cases.

Just imagine this large infrastructure that is currently used for basic research if that could be used 50 percent for industrial purposes — either for manufacturing something there to use in or maybe building something there that can be used on the ground.

Airbus is well positioned to take part in this. We have seen a similar effect in aircraft building and telecommunication satellites. At some point the agencies leave control to the industry and then the industry has the flexibility to do something. We believe that there is going to be a huge room for new services to be developed.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999949932098389}",neutral,0.9999949932098389,0
Airbus' A330-900neo Takes Off for the Very First Time - WIRED,"Fri, 20 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9haXJidXMtYTMzMC05MDAtbmVvL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The modern airplane-making business features a lot of players, but only two that actually matter: Boeing and Airbus. Naturally, instead of sharing the global market, they spent a lot of their time and resources on a never-ending battle of one-upmanship.

In its eternal quest to outmaneuver Boeing in the skies, Airbus' launched its latest riposte to Boeing's successful, (if initially troubled,) 787 Dreamliner. Thursday morning, the A330-900neo completed its maiden flight, a four-hour, 13-minute jaunt out of and into Toulouse-Blagnac airport in southwestern France, where the planemaker is based.

Airbus claims this new variant of the A330-900 will burn 14 percent less fuel than its predecessor, thanks to new and more efficient Rolls-Royce engines (""neo"" stands for new engine option), the use of drag-reducing winglets, and minor improvements to the way the wings slice through the air. (As a bonus for those without noise-canceling headphones, Airbus pledges the new engines will make half as much noise as the units they're replacing.)

The twin-aisle, wide-bodied jet will hold up to 287 passengers in a standard layout, 10 more than could cram into the outgoing model. Somehow, the plane-maker has maximized capacity without making life in the air a waking nightmare (though it has considered that). Rather, it squeezed in the extra seats by rejiggering its cabin design, reorienting and shrinking the crew rest quarters and lavatories. That means every economy seat is a plausible 18 inches wide. So, not quite a palace—but no dungeon, either.

This improved efficiency and increased seating is a big deal for Airbus. The airline industry operates on profit margins tighter than a middle seat on a Ryanair flight, and the key to wooing customers is burning less fuel and packing in passengers.

It's also a small but crucial step in the plane's long march to certification. Airbus plans to have the A330-900neo fully certified for service by mid-2018, but first it must complete a rigorous testing regime that includes 1,100 hours in the air. Thursday's first flight was a calm affair, but things are about to get rough. Before any paying passengers can climb aboard, Airbus' test pilots will torture the new jet every way they know how. They'll fly through the planet's harshest climates, at temperature and altitude extremes. They'll push it as high and fast as it can go. They'll pilot it through brutal turbulence and see how it handles aborted takeoffs and landings.

And once they're sure this plane is ready to take off for real, they'll get back to developing the next answer to whatever Boeing's cooking up.

The manufacturing giant will now partner with Bombardier on the project in a move described as “win-win”, which could be a vital boost following Boeing’s strong recent legal opposition.

Airbus’ extensive supply chain is expected to offer cost savings for the aircraft production, while the 100-150 seat aircraft will complement its own 150-seat plus jets.

""This is a win-win for everybody! The C Series, with its state-of-the-art design and great economics, is a great fit with our existing single-aisle aircraft family and rapidly extends our product offering into a fast growing market sector,” said Airbus chief executive Tom Enders.

“I have no doubt that our partnership with Bombardier will boost sales and the value of this programme tremendously.”

""Not only will this partnership secure the C Series and its industrial operations in Canada, the UK and China, but we also bring new jobs to the US. Airbus will benefit from strengthening its product portfolio in the high-volume single-aisle market, offering superior value to our airline customers worldwide.""

The future of the C Series project had been thrown into doubt following legal action by Boeing over aid received from the UK and Canadian governments, which resulted in a 300 percent import levy imposed by the US government.

Most notably, the tariff has raised questions over Delta’s £4.2bn order for up to 125 of the jets, which could now prove prohibitively expensive despite few viable alternatives in the 100-150 seat segment.

When the tariff was announced following Boeings legal action Bombardier denounced it as “hypocrisy”.

“Delta ordered the C Series because Boeing stopped making an aircraft of the size Delta needed years ago,” Bombardier said. “It is pure hypocrisy for Boeing to say that the C Series launch pricing is a ‘violation of global trade law’ when Boeing does the same for its new aircraft.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999964237213135}",positive,0.9999964237213135,1

NHV was the global launching customer of this platform, whose first two aircraft entered into service in December 2014. Since then the NHV fleet has expanded with an increasing number of H175s, with the last helicopter of the first batch of ten aircraft ordered in 2012 having recently been delivered. The deliveries of the remaining six aircraft, following a second batch confirmed by the customer in 2014, will take place in the coming years to broaden NHV’s capabilities.

“I am proud that, today, NHV is the only operator with a vast experience in flying the H175. Thanks to the collective dedication of our teams, who are putting the advanced capability of the H175 into practice every day while upholding the highest levels of safety, we are successfully positioning the H175 as the new standard for oil and gas missions. We also thank our valued customers and Airbus Helicopters for being our strong partners in this success story”, says Eric Van Hal, CEO of NHV Group.

Initially operated from Den Helder, NHV gradually expanded H175 operations to other bases in the North Sea and West Africa, where the aircraft has accumulated experience and gained maturity. The aircraft is currently in operation in NHV North Sea bases of Den Helder (Netherlands), Aberdeen (Scotland) and Esbjerg (Denmark).

“I want to thank NHV for being such a strong and reliable partner”, said Guillaume Faury, Airbus Helicopters CEO. “Together we have made the H175 a benchmark for offshore transport and have demonstrated that the aircraft delivers on its commitments of safety, reliability, comfort and cost effectiveness. They can count on our continued support to guarantee the success of their demanding missions”.

Since their entry-into-service, NHV’s H175s have completed more than 8500 flights and accumulated 15,000 flight hours, with certain missions conducted in challenging North Sea weather conditions and non-stop flights performed to distances of 180 NM with passengers and cargo.

The H175 delivers on all counts with its long range, smooth ride, excellent payload lift, outstanding cabin comfort and low sound levels. It is also very cost-effective and easy to maintain. The offshore and VIP versions are already in operation and Public Service version is scheduled to enter into service in the coming months.

Airbus-built full electric EUTELSAT 172B satellite reaches geostationary orbit in record time - Airbus,"Wed, 11 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNy0xMC1haXJidXMtYnVpbHQtZnVsbC1lbGVjdHJpYy1ldXRlbHNhdC0xNzJiLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS1yZWFjaGVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"New telecommunications satellite has completed the first electric orbit raising for a high capacity satellite in just four months after its launch in June, a world first

Paris / Toulouse, 11/10/2017 – The EUTELSAT 172B spacecraft, built by Airbus for Eutelsat, one of the world’s leading satellite operators, has now reached geostationary orbit, breaking the record for the fastest satellite electric orbit raising (EOR).

EUTELSAT 172B was launched by Ariane 5 from Kourou, in French Guiana, on 1 June 2017. The Airbus spacecraft control centre in Toulouse took control for early operations, initialisation, deployment of the solar array and electric propulsion arms, and completed initial testing prior to initiating the Electric Orbit Raising phase on 8 June. During this four-month phase, electric thrusters smoothly and efficiently propelled the satellite to the targeted orbit, consuming almost six times less propellant mass than for a satellite with chemical propulsion.

Following completion of the payload in-orbit tests and drift to its operational location led by the Eutelsat team, the satellite is scheduled to enter commercial service in November to provide enhanced telecommunications, in-flight broadband and broadcast services for the Asia-Pacific region. Its life span is expected to exceed 15 years thanks to electric propulsion for in-orbit raising and station-keeping.

“We are the first company to demonstrate full electric propulsion for satellites of this size and capacity, enabling their launch in the most cost-efficient manner. Furthermore with our system design, operation strategy and the plasma thruster technology we implement, we have completed the fastest electric orbit raising ever from transfer to geostationary orbit, which will allow Eutelsat to put their electric satellite into service in record time”, said Nicolas Chamussy, Head of Space Systems at Airbus.

Yohann Leroy, Eutelsat’s Chief Technical Officer, added: “EUTELSAT 172B confirms the relevance of Eutelsat’s early adoption of electric propulsion technology to optimise capex. In combining electric propulsion, High Throughput capacity, robotic arms and 3D printing techniques, our new satellite also reflects Europe’s capability to push the envelope of innovation in order to increase the competitiveness of our business. We look forward to bringing EUTELSAT 172B into service next month for our clients in the Asia-Pacific region.”

EUTELSAT 172B combines 13 kW of payload power with a launch mass of only 3,550 kg, thanks to the latest EOR version of Airbus’ highly reliable Eurostar E3000 platform.

The EOR success and reaching orbit in record time was made possible by two Airbus innovations:

- A pair of deployable robotic arms which orientate the satellite’s electric propulsion thrusters, and control thrust direction and attitude during different phases of the mission.

- The WALIS (Wide Angle Localisation Integrated System) network of ground stations around the world, developed by Airbus, which has enabled engineers to control orbit raising operations until the satellite reached geostationary orbit.

The development of Airbus’ Eurostar all-electric satellites has been supported by ESA and space agencies of European countries, in particular in France by the CNES in the framework of the PIA programme (Plan d’Investissements d’Avenir) and in the UK by the UK Space Agency.

Airbus' 'BLADE' laminar flow wing demonstrator makes first flight - Aerotech News,"Fri, 06 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90ZWNobmV3cy5jb20vYmxvZy8yMDE3LzEwLzA2L2FpcmJ1cy1ibGFkZS1sYW1pbmFyLWZsb3ctd2luZy1kZW1vbnN0cmF0b3ItbWFrZXMtZmlyc3QtZmxpZ2h0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus’ A340 laminar-flow “BLADE” test demonstrator aircraft (A340-300 MSN001) made its successful maiden flight for the EU-sponsored Clean Sky “Blade” project Sept. 26.

The aircraft, dubbed “Flight Lab”, took off from the Tarbes aerodrome in southern France at 11 a.m., local time, and after a series of successful tests it landed at Airbus’ facilities in Toulouse Blagnac. The overall flight time was 3hrs/38mins.

The BLADE project – which stands for “Breakthrough Laminar Aircraft Demonstrator in Europe” — is tasked with assessing the feasibility of introducing the technology for commercial aviation. It aims to improve aviation’s ecological footprint, bringing with it a 50% reduction of wing friction and up to five percent lower CO2 emission. Airbus’ A340 Flight Lab is the first test aircraft in the world to combine a transonic laminar wing profile with a true internal primary structure.

On the outside the aircraft is fitted with two representative transonic laminar outer-wings, while inside the cabin a highly complex specialist flight-test-instrumentation station has been installed. The extensive modifications to the A340-300 test-bed aircraft took place during the course of a 16-month working party in Tarbes, with the support of numerous industrial partners across Europe. Today’s first-flight marks the kick-off of the Blade flight-test campaign to explore the wing’s characteristics in flight.

“We began by opening the flight envelope to check that the aircraft was handling correctly,” explains Airbus Flight-Test Engineer, Philippe Seve, who was on board the flight. “We achieved our objective to fly at the design Mach number, at a reasonable altitude and check everything was fine. We also checked that the FTI was working as expected, to identify further fine-tuning for the next flights.”

In the run-up to the start of this flight-testing phase, a small team of 10 specially trained pilots, test engineers and flight test engineers had prepared for this milestone for several months, spending time in a simulator and familiarizing themselves with the FTI systems to be installed on the Airbus flight-test aircraft. Moreover, on equipment installation side, a working party of 70 people performed the FTI installation inside the aircraft, while teams from Bremen, Germany and Broughton, UK worked externally on the outer wings, with a team from Stade Germany, installing a pod containing infrared cameras on the fin.

On the wings, there are hundreds of points to measure the waviness of the surface to help Airbus’ engineers ascertain its influence on the laminarity – which is the first time that Airbus has used such a testing method on an aircraft. Other ‘firsts’ are the use of infrared cameras inside the pod to measure wing temperature and the acoustic generator which measures the influence of acoustics on laminarity. In addition, there is also an innovative reflectometry system, which measures overall deformation in real-time during flight.

A key goal of Blade is to be able to measure the tolerances and imperfections which can be present and still sustain laminarity. To this end, Airbus will simulate every type of imperfection in a controlled manner, so that at the end of the campaign the tolerances for building a laminar wing will be fully known. The flight Lab will perform around 150 flight hours in the coming months.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997406601905823}",neutral,0.9997406601905823,0

FlyScan assists customers with efficient and proactive analysation of HUMS data

London, Airbus Helicopters signed a contract with German operator Global Helicopter Service (GHS), making them the launch customer for the company’s new FlyScan service, software that helps customers to analyse and manage the Health & Usage Monitoring System (HUMS) data from their helicopter fleet activities.

“FlyScan sets a new standard of customer service based on true predictive maintenance: operators can anticipate formerly unscheduled events, avoid operational disruptions, and reach a new level of dispatch reliability,” said Matthieu Louvot, Executive Vice President of Customer Support at Airbus Helicopters. “It is one of the new services we offer our customers in line with our overarching goal to fully support them in safely and efficiently managing their operations.”

The HUMS system, a standard fixture on many Airbus Helicopters platforms, uses sensors placed throughout the aircraft to monitor key components and the overall behaviour of the machine. The system records large amounts of useful data, which is then transferred to various systems for interpretation. By effectively analysing such data and providing proactive feedback, FlyScan helps customers to enhance flight safety, increase fleet availability, and reduce the maintenance burden by up to seven percent.

“With FlyScan Supervise, we know we will have reliable insight coming directly from the manufacturer itself on the details and operational statistics of our in-service fleet,” said Dominik Goldfuss, CEO of GHS. “It also provides a smart solution for less complex organisations so they no longer have to worry about developing these capabilities in-house, as Airbus takes care of everything.”

Three different levels of FlyScan are available for the H225, H175, H145, H135 and Dolphin fleets equipped with HUMS:

• Advise, for customers already performing HUMS monitoring. HUMS experts from Airbus work in partnership with the customer to closely monitor the health parameters of their helicopters to better anticipate maintenance events.

• Supervise, for customers without a HUMS expert in their organisation. Airbus manages the various thresholds implemented and closely monitors any event that occurs in the fleet.

• Guard, for customers already managing a HUMS system. Airbus brings its expertise to the customer’s doorstep, supporting teams in surveying their fleets. This package includes a specific HUMS hotline available 24/7, and commits to responding to AOG requests within a few hours.

FlyScan is part of the HCare Technical Support offer, providing 24/7 technical support, continuous airworthiness management and global technical assistance. Additional FlyScan contracts are planned to conclude this year, and the company’s objective is for FlyScan to become a standard service for the entire helicopter HUMS community.

(Oct. 19, 2017) — Boeing woke up to a rude surprise on Tuesday. The Chicago-based corporation thought they had gotten the Trump Administration to stymie their competition from Quebec-based airplane manufacturer Bombardier through a monumental 300 percent tariff. But instead, the French Canadians tossed the ball to Toulose, France-based Airbus, which will manufacture and sell the same planes out of Alabama. No foreign-made planes, no tariff, no basis for Boeing to lodge a formal complaint. Quelle horreur!

First off, Boeing’s initial complaints made no competitive sense. Boeing told the U.S. Department of Labor that it was unfair for Bombardier to have sold Delta Airlines 75 jets from its new C Series, which carry 110-130 passengers each. Boeing doesn’t even make a similar model that can compete with the C Series, so it’s essentially trying to force Delta to buy planes that are bigger and more costly than they want.

The basis of Boeing’s complaints originate in deep hypocrisy. Boeing alleged that Bombardier engaged in price dumping by agreeing to sell their planes for almost $14 million below their cost price, which they could do because of government support to build the C Series. Indeed, Quebec gave Bombardier $2.5 billion in 2015. That sounds like a lot, but it doesn’t even reach the scale of Boeing’s $12 billion in assistance from Washington state! If aerospace companies never received financial assistance from governments, few large commercial aircraft would ever be built. But still, we shouldn’t let Bombardier get away with that, should we?

Boeing’s aircraft sales are eight times larger than Bombardier’s today. Taking legal action shows Boeing doesn’t like market capitalism. They just want the dominant market share. Meanwhile, Boeing’s actions may hurt its sales in Canada, which is now looking to cancel its orders of Boeing’s super hornet fighter jets and buy from Australia instead.

You might think that our national political leaders would be ecstatic over Tuesday’s announcement that Airbus was taking more than 50 percent ownership of Bombardier’s C Series and would be building a second production line in the United States. That’s more jobs in the U.S. — just what we want. But it’s all quiet in D.C.

There is a problem for Washington state in all this. It is not that Boeing’s 737 line is threatened, as that is designed for a different niche of flight and seating. It is that Airbus is planning to build the C Series assembly line in Alabama. That’s a long way from Everett. Puget Sound has the best and highest concentration of aerospace talent, intellectual capital, machinists and engineers in the world — many of whom are unemployed, because Boeing has cut 16,000 jobs in our state in the past three years. Alabama doesn’t offer anything close.

Yet we still have that little law, pushed through in a two-day special session in 2013, giving Boeing a $12 billion tax break from 2004 through 2040. While that law was written at the behest and urging and threats of Boeing, it is tailored to benefit any aerospace company, and would also apply to companies such as Airbus, which might intend to construct new facilities for “manufacturing superefficient airplanes.”

That moniker certainly fits the C Series, which is more efficient (and comfortable) than Boeing’s offerings. Its seats are wider. Its overhead bins are bigger. Its windows are larger. With its composite construction and engines from American manufacturer Pratt and Whitney, it’s a good deal for airlines, using 20 percent less fuel than the 737. That’s superefficient!

Rather than just sit and watch Airbus put together its new C Series assembly in Alabama, our elected officials, the Machinists union and the engineers union, SPEEA, could figure out a package for Airbus in our state.

Here in Washington we have the facilities, the personnel, the training pipeline and the popular interest. By law, we would offer the same tax incentives that we hand out to Boeing. But there would be a difference. While Boeing uses those tax incentives to ship jobs out of Washington, Airbus would use those tax incentives to actually create new jobs in our state. If our leaders really want to bring good jobs in aerospace to our state, they’d stop just doing Boeing’s bidding. But do they have the political will?

Airbus' A330neo takes flight with nacelle systems from Safran Nacelles - safran-group.com,"Thu, 19 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhZnJhbi1ncm91cC5jb20vbmV3cy9haXJidXMtYTMzMG5lby10YWtlcy1mbGlnaHQtbmFjZWxsZS1zeXN0ZW1zLXNhZnJhbi1uYWNlbGxlcy0yMDE3LTEwLTE50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"October 19, 2017

Today’s maiden flight of the Airbus A330neo (New Engine Option) jetliner marks an important milestone for Safran Nacelles – underscoring the company’s role as a supplier of choice for complete nacelle systems, as well as reinforcing its position in the market category of high-thrust, long-haul jetliners.

The no. 1 A330neo performed its first takeoff from Airbus’ headquarters operation at Toulouse-Blagnac Airport in southwestern France, and returned to the facility after four hours aloft. Safran Nacelles has a major nacelle/engine integration facility located at Colomiers, which is adjacent to Airbus’ Clément Ader A330 final assembly line at Toulouse-Blagnac Airport.

As a direct supplier to Airbus, Safran Nacelles has complete responsibility for the A330neo nacelles – from design and manufacture to their integration on the twin-engine aircraft’s Rolls-Royce's Trent 7000 powerplants. Safran Nacelles also will offer support and service once the A330neo is in airline operation.

A 42-month development to meet Airbus’ A330neo program scheduling

To meet Airbus scheduling for the A330neo program, Safran Nacelles developed the jetliner’s nacelle system during an unprecedented lead time of only 42 months – some 18 months shorter than a standard cycle. This rapid development was made possible, in part, by the use of virtual reality to quickly validate new manufacturing and assembly methods, design ergonomic tools and efficiently train operators.

Virtual reality allows for immersion and interactivity with the industrial environment through dynamic 3D glasses. This resulted in a tool budget being reduced by 10 percent and validation times for industrial milestones cut in half.

In addition to working with an international supply chain, Safran Nacelles’ own industrial sites in Colomiers, Le Havre and Florange, France; Burnley in the U.K.; and Casablanca, Morocco, contribute to A330neo nacelle production.

The A330neo’s nacelle has an interior diameter of 3.65 meters, placing it in the same size category as those produced by Safran Nacelles for the Airbus A380 – for which the company also has full development and integration responsibility. As with the A380, Safran Nacelles applied its expertise in the use of composite materials, acoustic treatment and system architecture.

The Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engine has a rating of 68,000-72,000 lbs. thrust at maximum output, and is a successor to this engine manufacturer’s Trent 700 powerplant used on current-production A330s. Safran Nacelles supplies thrust reversers for the Trent 700, having provided some 1,400 since the beginning of deliveries in the 1990s for the A330; the company also has responsibility for the integration.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997972846031189}",neutral,0.9997972846031189,0
Airbus delights in airline design reaction to A320 Airspace options - Runway Girl Network,"Wed, 11 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTcvMTAvYWlyYnVzLWRlbGlnaHRzLWluLWFpcmxpbmUtZGVzaWduLXJlYWN0aW9uLXRvLWEzMjAtYWlyc3BhY2Utb3B0aW9ucy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sitting in the first public mockup of Airbus’ Airspace cabin, it was striking how much of a revolution this interior redesign is for the narrowbody passenger experience — and, with more than five thousand A320 family narrowbodies currently on order, how many passengers on how many flights will benefit. It’s not just the larger overhead bins, extra inch at the shoulders, or improved sense of window space with the new shrouding, either. It’s that Airspace provides a canvas for airlines and their designers to truly customise their #PaxEx to differentiate their product from others.

Airbus vice president for cabin marketing Ingo Wuggetzer, one of the key champions behind bringing the widebody feel to the narrowbody passenger experience, tells Runway Girl Network the reaction to the unveiling at the APEX EXPO was “amazing, generally. People passing by were always stopping, taking photos, looking in there, asking, ‘Can I have, can I see, can I join, can I experience it?’”

“All the visitors we had from airlines really love it. They are all impressed how we changed the experience inside a single-aisle aircraft, impressed about the visual appearance, and the possibilities that generates for them to apply their brains,” Wuggetzer says. “The question is actually, ‘When can we have it?’ It’s about the timing and it’s about the availability and ramp-up of those solutions.”

Airbus isn’t the only airframer to bring widebody inspiration into the narrowbody market, of course, with Boeing’s 737 Sky Interior developed from the Signature Interior of its latest twin-aisle jets. But the level of customisation available to airlines, and the level of Airbus branding carried through the cabin, is a step change from previous generations.

Airspace has been shown so far with the overhead signature lighting in the aisle displayed with what Wuggetzer calls “our pattern, our standard Airspace pattern, the ice crystals. Ice blue is the color we use for that. This is something you can customise completely.” Expect to see the design language of airlines worldwide rolled out onto the ceiling of Airbus narrowbodies from 2020, whether it’s the Delta widget waffle, Etihad facets, or whatever texture an airline wants. It will be fascinating to see how airlines choose to brand this space: whether it’s with their actual brand equity — prone to immediate obsolescence in the event of a rebrand — or with something more abstract that blends in with it.

Not up for shaping customisation so far, though, is the U-shaped section at the front of the overhead lighting section, which “is driven by functionality, because still under the center panel you have a circuit breaker box,” Wuggetzer says. Members of the U-Fly Alliance may be delighted that their logo matches, but it will be interesting to see whether other carriers are enthusiastic to make a shape change.

In terms of the Airspace co-branding, it seems Airbus’ perspective has evolved since the unveiling of the original A330 Airspace in March 2016 and the A320 Airspace at the Paris Air Show this June. “If we can provide with that brand a value that is recognized by the passengers, that would add value to the airline brand as well,” Wuggetzer says. “So that means the more we invest in building up that brand, that could be a positive co-branding opportunity.”

There are, of course, a couple of mockup-related issues: for a start, the opening bins were positioned opposite a cutaway section, which made for great visuals but means that we will have to wait for a larger mockup to see what the experience is like for passengers to actually lift their bags into the overheads from an aisle with seats and bins on both sides.

Your author also noted that the bins seemed to be hanging an inch or two lower on the ceiling than expected, and that the visibility of seat number stickers was a little poor. Fetching an iPad from the back of the stand, Wuggetzer explained that my eyes weren’t deceiving me, and that as part of the Airbus team’s need to freeze the design of their mockup, the attachment of the prototype bins was not as flush to the ceiling as the final product will be. This also precluded the open bins from fitting as neatly into the ceiling panel recess as hoped.

But it’s overall an impressive product, ripe with flexible design possibilities for airlines, best demonstrated by, after a throwaway joke asking “just how purple does this thing go”, Wuggetzer had the team turn up the violet lighting to 11, washing the space in a moodlit bath of purple. Imagine what Airbus can do for an actual airline.

Boeing Has a Secret Weapon for Competing With the Airbus A321 - Yahoo Finance,"Sat, 28 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9ib2Vpbmctc2VjcmV0LXdlYXBvbi1jb21wZXRpbmctYWlyYnVzLTE0NDAwMDk1NC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When Boeing (NYSE: BA) launched the 737 MAX 10 earlier this year, many aerospace pundits panned it as a poor man's Airbus (NASDAQOTH: EADSY) A321. Nevertheless, the 737 MAX 10 won hundreds of orders and commitments at the 2017 Paris Air Show, including an important order conversion from U.S. airline giant United Continental (NYSE: UAL).

In fact, Boeing has a secret weapon that has helped it win all of United's new narrowbody aircraft orders recently: a ""most-favored customer clause"" granted by Airbus to American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL). This clause could give Boeing a huge advantage in competing for an upcoming aircraft order from Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL).

The origin of this secret weapon

Back in 2011, Airbus scored a major coup when American Airlines ordered 260 A320-family jets, after years as an all-Boeing airline. Indeed, it was this impending order that forced Boeing to create the 737 MAX to hang on to a portion of American's business.

American Airlines' then-parent AMR was in financial distress at the time, which limited its bargaining power. As a result, while Airbus offered the company substantial help in financing the deal, it didn't need to provide as big a discount as would be typical for an order of that size.

However, there was one catch: a most-favored customer clause. According to Scott Kirby -- who is currently the president of United Continental, but held the same role at American Airlines until August 2016 -- Airbus agreed that if it gave another airline more favorable pricing, it would refund the difference to American Airlines. This is limiting Airbus' ability to match the pricing that Boeing can offer to key customers.

The details are murky

At an employee meeting earlier this month, Kirby indicated that while United is interested in buying narrowbody planes from Airbus, the latter can't provide a competitive price right now. That's why United has 161 orders for the 737 MAX family and none for the A320neo family.

Story continues

Some aerospace analysts were puzzled by this statement. After all, Airbus has sold thousands of A320neo family planes since announcing the American Airlines deal. It has also sold over 100 A321s to Delta Air Lines (American's other main rival) at bargain prices. Furthermore, it seems odd that Airbus would have agreed to terms that might seriously impair its sales efforts.

One possibility is that the most-favored customer clause only applies to new-engine aircraft rather than the current-generation planes that Delta has bought recently. It also could apply only to U.S. carriers -- and perhaps even just U.S. legacy carriers. The one detail that Kirby confirmed is that the most-favored customer clause expires eventually. (He didn't say when.)

This is a huge advantage for Boeing

To the extent that the most-favored customer clause is applicable, it's a big stumbling block for Airbus. Of course, Airbus could always just give another customer whatever discount is needed to close the deal and pay American the refund it would be entitled to. However, this could severely damage its profitability.

For example, suppose Boeing and Airbus are competing for a 100-plane order and Boeing offers a price that would allow it (or Airbus) to make a $5 million profit per plane. Let's also suppose that this price is $5 million less than the pricing Airbus had offered American Airlines on its outstanding deal for 100 A320neo-family planes. If Airbus were to match Boeing's price, the $5 million per-plane profit it would make from the new deal would be completely offset by having to give American an additional $5 million discount on each of the 100 planes it has on order.

Given that the Airbus and Boeing narrowbody families are both sold out for years, there's no incentive for Airbus to sign any deal that would trigger refunds to American Airlines.

A mystery solved?

Boeing has feuded with Delta Air Lines repeatedly in recent years. In 2015, Delta's management took great pains to highlight falling resale values for Boeing 777 jets. In 2016, Delta canceled an order for 18 Dreamliners. During the past year, Boeing has been working to block a deal for Delta to acquire 75 CS100 aircraft from Bombardier. And over the past three years, Delta has orchestrated a campaign to limit the expansion of Emirates, Qatar Airways, and Etihad Airways -- three of Boeing's most valuable customers.

In light of this acrimony, many pundits have assumed that Delta has no interest in doing business with Boeing right now. This isn't just a theoretical issue: Delta hopes to order about 75 next-generation narrowbody planes within the next few months.

However, Delta's management has consistently maintained that its various disputes with Boeing don't affect the likelihood that it will order planes from the U.S. aerospace giant. Now, we may know why. Delta Air Lines has a reputation for being very savvy about getting the best deal possible. There's a good chance that Boeing will win this competition by offering a price for its 737 MAX that Airbus won't be able to match.

The schedule is on track after CityAirbus conducted successful ground tests of the electric power system it’s using to propel the vehicle through the air.

The CityAirbus craft is a vertical take-off and landing craft that uses a four rotor design, and that would be able to take up to four passengers on short flights in dense urban areas, with the aim of connecting major transportation hubs including train stations and airports. It’s designed to be pilot operated at launch, but to eventually transition to being a fully autonomous vehicle once the tech catches up.

CNBC reports that Airbus is aiming to operate the craft along fixed, predetermined routes, with top air speeds of around 80 mph. They’ll be able to skip over the traffic that can dramatically increase travel times entering and exiting busy city transit points, which would theoretically also help alleviate ground congestion.

Short hop flights are also an ideal application of battery electric tech, since that’s all that vehicles will be able to manage using fully electric power sources in the near-term. Plus, battery unit swapping or autonomous dock charging could help make it easier to make these vehicles fully self-flying in the future.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9543294310569763}",neutral,0.9543294310569763,0

""It's a win-win deal for everyone,"" said the president of Airbus, Tom Enders, adding that the partnership would secure industrial operations in Canada, Britain and China and bring new jobs to the US.

""I have no doubt that our partnership with Bombardier will boost sales and the value of this program enormously.""

By adding the C Series to its lineup of larger jetliners, the Toulouse-based Airbus adds to its portfolio and gains access to an advanced aircraft that cost Bombardier over $6 billion (€5.1 billion) to develop.

Bombardier CEO Alain Bellemare said Airbus is the perfect partner for the company, Quebec and Canada.

""Their global scale, strong customer relationships and operational expertise are key ingredients for unleashing the full value of the C Series,"" he said in a statement. ""This partnership should more than double the value of the C Series program and ensures our remarkable game-changing aircraft realizes its full potential.""

We have lift-off

Earlier Bombardier was reportedly looking for investors and considering selling parts of its aerospace business, including its Q400 turboprop and CRJ regional-jet unit.

Analysts said the deal could breath new life into a slow-selling plane and open a new front in the battle with US aerospace firm Boeing over global aircraft sales.

The deal also remakes the aerospace landscape by putting Airbus's global position behind the C Series, for which Bombardier hasn't won a major order in 18 months. It is seen enabling big production savings on the C Series aircraft by allowing Bombardier to make use of Airbus's international sales reach.

The C Series program - which was overdue and over-budget - has been a crucial part of Bellemare's five-year turnaround plan aimed at improving cash flows and increasing profit growth. The Quebec government acquired a 49.5 per cent stake in the C Series program for $1 billion in 2015.

In the line of duties

The transaction also puts Airbus into the center of Bombardier's ongoing trade dispute with rival Boeing.

Boeing has accused Bombardier of manufacturing its 100-150 seat planes with the help of public subsidies and selling them at a loss to Delta Air Lines.

The US Commerce Department recently announced it would impose an 80 percent duty on Bombardier's exports to the US, on top of duties of nearly 220 percent.

ATLANTA -- Amsterdam will become Delta’s next destination for its brand-new Airbus A350 aircraft.

That will come in March, when carrier will add non-stop flights from Detroit to Amsterdam, Delta CEO Ed Bastian said Wednesday in Atlanta during a Q&A with reporters.

With that, Amsterdam becomes the fifth destination Delta has announced for its A350s. Amsterdam is the main hub for KLM, a close joint-venture partner of Delta.

Also on Wednesday, Delta said it use A350s on its route between Detroit and Shanghai starting April 19.

Delta’s first revenue flights on the aircraft will begin Oct. 30 when the aircraft begins taking over flights on the airline's route between Detroit and Tokyo Narita. The A350 will next begin flying Delta’s Detroit-Seoul routes Nov. 18 and its Detroit-Beijing routes Jan. 17. The company also will use its A350s for its Atlanta-Seoul flights starting March 24.

In part, Delta plans to use its new A350s to help phase out its Boeing 747 jets, which the carrier plans to by the end of this year. Delta’s A350s will be configured with 306 seats, including 32 of its new “Delta One” business-class suites and 48 of its new international-style “Premium Select” premium economy seats.

Airbus' Airspace A320s to Launch with JetBlue - PaxEx.Aero,"Tue, 03 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vcGF4ZXguYWVyby9haXJidXMtYWlyc3BhY2UtYTMyMC1sYXVuY2gtamV0Ymx1ZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"More shoulder room? Larger overhead bins? Better window views? All this is coming to an A320neo near you with the Airspace by Airbus cabin redesign. JetBlue will be the launch customer for the new layout; deliveries starting in 2020 will see the new cabin design take flight.

The Airspace by Airbus concept launched 18 months ago with the A350 and A330neo as the first models to see the upgrades. The A320 version launched in June without a customer announced. With JetBlue now on board as the launch partner we can start to think about the more practical side of what it means for airlines and passengers.

The announcement of a launch customer allows the pair to share some of the progress they’ve made together since the concept was first considered. Ingo Wuggetzer,Airbus’ VP Cabin Marketing, was keen to point out that the details now on show are the result of teamwork and collaboration, not just ideas from the airline or the OEM, “We developed it together. We have been involved for over a year, setting the priorities and shaping the product together.”

For JetBlue the Airspace cabin is seen as an evolution of the company’s product line. After launching Mint three years ago and beginning the economy class (“Core”) cabin refresh project with the A321 fleet it is time for something more significant to come to the A320neo fleet on order.

Our next big thing is Airspace and we cannot be happier. We’re going to leverage the [Airspace] platform as a canvas to paint our inflight brand, innovate and enhance our already great customer experience which I consider one of the best in the US market. I’m really looking forward to being a leader and a global launch customer to partner and create something exceptional for our customers. – Mariya Stoyanova, JetBlue’s Director Product Development

The Airspace “platform” is not available until 2020 meaning that JetBlue will take delivery of roughly 30 A320neo family aircraft without the Airspace product on board based on current fleet plans. But some travelers will still benefit a bit earlier. One of the major components of Airspace – the overhead bins – will be available in 2019. JetBlue is not yet publicly committed to installing those before the full Airspace concept rolls out but at least one other airline is. Wuggetzer shared that “[A]nother North American customer will start with line fit but also take retrofits [of new overhead bins]. We are really proud that we have a big order for retrofit. This proves the value to us. That is a very good signal.”

JetBlue is publicly committed to ~70 line-fit deliveries with Airspace as part of the product launch but no retrofits.

Airbus Corporate Jets wins new ACJ319neo order - Airbus,"Tue, 10 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNy0xMC1haXJidXMtY29ycG9yYXRlLWpldHMtd2lucy1uZXctYWNqMzE5bmVvLW9yZGVy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Builds on best cabin flying even farther

Airbus Corporate Jets (ACJ) has won a new A319neo[1] order, from an Asian customer that is trading up from a traditional business jet, highlighting the market appeal of the aircraft family’s proven cabin and improved intercontinental range.

The order means that new and existing customers have now placed a total of nine orders – three ACJ319neo and six ACJ320neo - for the new ACJ320 family. Customers include Acropolis Aviation, Comlux, K5 Aviation and undisclosed clients.

“The ACJ320neo Family capitalises on the trend toward larger cabins in top-of-the-line business jets, while giving customers even more intercontinental range and efficiency in what is already a popular and airline-reliable performer,” states Airbus Chief Operating Officer, Customers, John Leahy.

With the ability to fly eight passengers 6,750 nm/12,500 km or 15 hours, the ACJ319neo will bring much of the world within nonstop range. Complementing it is the ACJ320neo, which will fly 25 passengers 6,000 nm/11,100 km or 13 hours.

Deliveries of the ACJ320neo begin at the end of 2018, while those of the ACJ319neo start in the second quarter of 2019.

Featuring the most spacious cabins of any business jet, while being similar in size to competing large-cabin aircraft, the ACJ320neo Family also delivers similar operating costs. The ACJ320neo Family can do this because its lower maintenance and training overheads – part of its airliner heritage – deliver a similar total cost when combined with fuel and navigation and landing charges.

Almost 10,000 Airbus aircraft are in service worldwide today, supported by a globe-spanning network of spares and training centres, giving corporate jet customers unmatched support in the field. Airbus corporate jet customers also benefit from services tailored to their particular needs, such as the “one call handles all” corporate jet customer care centre (C4you), customised maintenance programmes and the ACJ Service Centre Network.

Combined with the inherent reliability that comes from aircraft designed to fly many times a day, the ACJ320neo Family is both dependable and available when customers need it.

Airbus corporate jets are part of the world’s most modern aircraft family, which delivers, as standard, features which either cost more, or are unavailable, in competitors. These features include the protection and simplicity of fly-by-wire controls, the benefits of Category 3B autoland, and time and cost-saving centralised maintenance on all systems.

More than 180 Airbus corporate jets are in service on every continent, including Antarctica, highlighting their versatility in challenging environments.

[Narrator] The airplane making business

is a bit like international relations

from the late 20th century, lots of players,

but only two superpowers that actually matter.

The never ending sales war waged

by Boeing and Airbus has created

a good old fashioned arms race,

and now, Airbus has launched its newest weapon.

The A330-900 NEO just completed its maiden flight,

a four hour 13 minute jaunt.

It took off from and landed at

Toulouse-Blagnac Airport in Southwestern France

where the European plane maker is based.

The twin-aisle, wide-body jet is Airbus' latest answer

to Boeing's very successful 787 Dreamliner.

This game is all about winning over profit hungry airlines

with planes that pack more people and burn less fuel.

Thanks to a retriggered cabin, this variant of the 330 NEO

will hold as many as 287 passengers.

That's a 10 seat increase over the original plane,

which launched in July 2014.

More efficient engines from Rolls Royce

should cut fuel use and drop noise levels in half.

Slightly longer wings and what Airbus calls sharklets,

those are the upturned wing tips,

should bring the efficiency gain to a whopping 14 percent.

All told, Airbus thinks it has a formula

that can win airlines away from the American's at Boeing,

but before it can start deliveries,

it has to prove the A330 NEO 900 is safe for the skies.

This maiden voyage marks the start

of the flight test campaign that'll do exactly that.

Before letting any paying passengers aboard,

Airbus test pilots will spend 1100 hours

aloft in the new jet, aiming to

secure its certification by mid 2018,

then it's time to start deliveries

and get back to preparing the next weapon

in the never ending race for aviation dominance.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9915532469749451}",neutral,0.9915532469749451,0

The US Department of Commerce has proposed a 299.45% tariff on C Series coming to the US.

Airbus will now build the US-bound C Series jets in Alabama to get around potential tariffs.

The C Series is an ultra fuel-efficient composite airliner that promises great passenger comfort.

On Monday, Airbus announced that it has acquired a 50.01% stake in Bombardier's next-generation C Series airliner program. Mechanisms within this week's deal will see Airbus taking complete ownership of the C Series program in less than five years.

The C Series is the same aircraft at the heart of a simmering trade war between Canada and the US.

On September 26, the US Department of Commerce's International Trade Administration called for a tariff of 219.63% on Bombardier's C Series jet. A week later, the ITA called for another 79.82% tariff. In total, all C Series jets entering the US could be subject to tariffs of 299.45%.

The action was taken in response to a complaint filed by Boeing in April regarding Delta Air Lines' order for 75 of the Canadian jets.

Boeing believes that its business was harmed by Bombardier using Canadian government subsidies to give Delta a price substantially below the cost of building the planes.

In response, Bombardier and Delta have called the ITA's preliminary decision ""absurd."" Last week, on the airline's earnings call, Delta CEO Ed Bastian that his company will not pay the proposed tariffs.

The deal between Airbus and Bombardier is a direct response to the looming tariff action.

Although Airbus will make no up-front cash investment in the program, production of US-bound C Series jets will switch from Quebec, Canada to its factory in Mobile, Alabama.

The two firms believe producing the C Series in the US will bypass any potential tariffs levied by the Department of Commerce.

But what about the plane itself? What makes it so special?

Shortly after the announcement of Delta's controversial C Series order in April 2016, Bombardier flew one of its CS100 demonstrators down to the airline's Atlanta headquarters for journalists and the airline's staff to get a closer look.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999864101409912}",neutral,0.9999864101409912,0

By Tim Hepher

TOULOUSE, France (Reuters) - Airbus (AIR.PA) on Thursday staged the delayed maiden flight of its A330neo jetliner, an upgraded version of its profitable A330 series designed to buttress European sales against the latest model of the Boeing (BA.N) 787 Dreamliner.

The wide-bodied, long-distance jet took off from the planemaker's Toulouse headquarters under overcast skies, watched by top executives from Airbus and Britain's Rolls-Royce (RR.L), which supplies the engines.

In service since the 1990s, the A330 family is Airbus's biggest-selling wide-body jet but the arrival of Boeing's composite-body Dreamliner has eroded that position.

Airbus hopes the A330neo's refreshed design with new engines will help it defend its position in the lucrative 250-300 seat market, as a second honeymoon in the market and a burst of orders caused by production delays at Boeing start to peter out.

Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier said Airbus had decided to improve the plane's maximum take-off weight by around 4 percent to 251 tonnes so that the A330neo can serve longer routes such as Kuala Lumpur to London from 2020.

Separately, Bregier said Airbus still expected to deliver ""around 200"" of the smaller A320neo aircraft in 2017, but added that meeting this previously stated target would be tough.

Bregier said Pratt & Whitney (UTX.N), whose industrial problems have delayed deliveries of Airbus jets, was testing re-designed parts for its engines and expected to start delivering the modified version at the end of this year.

That suggests Airbus hopes to end an 18-month crisis over Pratt & Whitney engine delays some time next year.

For now, undelivered jets continue to crowd the tarmac in Toulouse as Pratt & Whitney diverts engines from the production line to a pool of spares to supply airlines that are having to take engines out of service for early maintenance.

The majority of the delayed jets are destined for airlines that have selected Pratt & Whitney’s new Geared Turbofan engine. CFM International, co-owned by General Electric (GE.N) and Safran (SAF.PA), is also supplying engines for the A320neo.

Story continues

MID-YEAR DELIVERY

The A330neo's debut flight was also delayed by the late completion of Trent 7000 engines from Rolls-Royce, which has been juggling demands with two other development projects.

Rolls-Royce says the bigger new engines are 10 percent more efficient and half as noisy as the previous generation.

Airbus said the A330neo would enter service in the middle of next year compared with an original target of fourth quarter this year, when the project was launched in 2014.

The A330neo and A320neo are examples of relatively cheap upgrades being carried out by Airbus and Boeing to take advantage of a leap forward in engine design, while also bringing out costlier all-new models like the A350 and 787.

Airbus earlier this week announced plans to absorb the high-tech but financially troubled CSeries aircraft of Canadian rival Bombardier in a deal that offers it new technology and a wider geographic presence in exchange for lending its marketing clout.

Airbus is now touting Canada as its ""fifth home nation"" after Britain, France, Germany and Spain where it was founded.

Once the deal is completed in around a year's time, the new-generation CSeries is expected to fill a gap below Airbus's current portfolio in the market for 100-150 seats.

"Airbus sees order uptick, bullish on 20-year global sales - Vertical Magazine","Tue, 03 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLXNlZXMtb3JkZXItdXB0aWNrLWJ1bGxpc2gtMjAteWVhci1nbG9iYWwtc2FsZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters is reporting a 27 percent increase in civil and parapublic orders in the first half of this year, as hopes on the Asian market are beginning to materialize.

The uptick, measured in units, mainly comprises light models – H125, H135 and H145. The region that contributed the most was Asia.

Global sales for all helicopter manufacturers grew by three percent in the period. However, the manufacturer notes this only should be seen as a stabilization overall. “The helicopter market began to stabilize in the first half of 2017 after seven years of erosion,” David Prevor, Airbus Helicopters’ head of marketing, said. The market, “still at a low level,” is expected to “recover” in 2018.

Airbus is betting on some key world economies, currently “underequipped,” to drive the growth over the 2017 to 2036 period, according to a global market forecast the manufacturer released on the eve of the Helitech show in London. China, India, Indonesia and Turkey, for example, combine large economies and major needs, Airbus believes. In China, the manufacturer has particular hope for growth in the emergency medical services market.

Some €125 billion ($146 billion) worth of helicopters above five seats or two metric tons are expected to be delivered over 2017 to 2036. The value of the support and service business is expected to be greater, at €245 billion. Of the 22,000 helicopters delivered, 50 percent will be light singles, according to Airbus.

The company has great hopes for super medium rotorcraft. H175 sales have so far been slow, mainly due to the trough in offshore oil-and-gas. But the super medium segment is expected to represent 21 percent of sales, in value, over the 2017 to 2036 period. Airbus recently ordered H175 cockpit control panels from France-based Latecoere and the numbers suggest at least 20 H175 deliveries per year over the next five years.

Sales in the energy sector will decline, partly because of the expected decrease in the world’s reliance on oil. But the sector will not disappear for helicopters. Wind farms will need one helicopter per 80 turbines, Prevor said.

The global fleet is foreseen to grow by 50 percent from 2017 to 2036. Sales in Asia-Pacific will account for a considerable portion of the global fleet’s expansion, thanks to a 157 percent growth of the fleet in the region over the period. Besides new demand in Asia-Pacific, another driver will be North American replacement needs.

Despite Airbus Helicopters’ significant research and development investment in high-speed rotorcraft, the category is not factored in the forecast.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8993226885795593}",positive,0.8993226885795593,1

Airbus Helicopters CEO: I want to use the H225 accident to enhance safety - Vertical Magazine,"Tue, 10 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvYWlyYnVzLWhlbGljb3B0ZXJzLWNlby13YW50LXVzZS1oMjI1LWFjY2lkZW50LWVuaGFuY2Utc2FmZXR5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters CEO Guillaume Faury has defended the global performance of the H225 program, and claimed the situation facing the aircraft in the North Sea, where operators appear reluctant to operate the type again after an accident in April 2016, should be seen as an opportunity to raise the overall level of safety in the industry.

Speaking with Vertical at the Helitech show last week in London, Faury said the program is doing well in other areas of the world and for other missions, describing those offshore oil-and-gas operators expressing a lack of confidence as “exceptions.” The relationship with most operators has remained “good” since the beginning of the crisis, he said. “Our customers realize we are at their side.”

H225 operations are now allowed by all civil aviation authorities in the world. As of late September, 183 of the aircraft had returned to service. This was out of a global fleet of 346 civil and military H225s and Super Puma L2s (the two types affected by earlier main gearbox problems). “Return to service is ongoing,” Faury said.

The absence of orders since April 2016 in the oil-and-gas market should be put in perspective, he said. The Sikorsky S-92 has also not received any oil-and-gas orders, he noted, as this market segment is still suffering from overcapacity. Despite this, the H225 has recorded sales in the VIP, parapublic (for the Japan Coast Guard, for instance) and military segments. “Other operators [outside of offshore oil-and-gas] have a very positive view of this aircraft,” Faury said. Asked whether the program could be terminated, he said, “this is not an option.”

But Faury does not hide from the “major setback” the program has encountered. “I want to use the H225 accident to enhance safety and make us progress; my role is to give a meaning to all this, for more safety, new practices and new technologies,” he said.

As part of this, Airbus Helicopters engineers have designed a full-flow magnetic plug, which “sees” the entire oil flow. Detection of metal particles, which may indicate spalling, is thus improved. Before the Norway crash, spalling was a precursor to the failure of the main gearbox, but had gone unnoticed. Research into vibration sensing and analysis on moving gears – another way to reveal damage – is ongoing.

Moreover, engineers have gone back and checked stress analysis for every model in the product range. And, after excluding one of two types of planet gear for the H225, they similarly removed two types of planet gears for the Dauphin family.

Another precautionary measure has been with logistics, to prevent “external damage.” The failed main gearbox on the accident aircraft in Norway had been involved in a road accident during transport in 2015, but the Accident Investigation Board of Norway said it found no connection with the crack. Airbus Helicopters said it has taken action to avoid such a scenario – a main gearbox suffering a road accident and then being put back into service – in future.

The airframer has therefore devised an enhanced packaging. The main gearbox inside the new crate benefits from better dampening. Internal sensors monitor bank angles, temperature, hygrometry and acceleration. The last sensor thus detects shocks. A second, similar sensor is made conspicuous on an outer side of the crate, thus signaling to handlers that a shock may be traced back to them.

In a survey, Airbus Helicopters has found that 60 percent of the 5,000 respondents (all in the offshore oil-and-gas sector) would be uncomfortable with flying in the H225. A second finding, however, was the majority did not know what the company had done to address the aircraft’s woes.

The manufacturer has therefore launched an “awareness campaign.” Airbus Helicopters officials say they have maintained contact with oil-and-gas safety organizations like Step Change In Safety in the U.K. They are now transitioning to a phase of “explanation to customers.” On their to-do list, they will soon have meetings with pilots, maintenance technicians and, ultimately, passengers.

The H225’s planned successor, codenamed the X6, is still in the “concept phase.” The market is volatile and “we are refining our market studies and long-term outlook,” Faury explained. “We are not at the end of the feasibility study.”","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.3804199993610382}",negative,0.3804199993610382,-1

Hamburg, 3 October 2017 – Emirates Airline, the Airbus Foundation and the NGO Welthungerhilfe have joined forces to bring emergency shelter items from Hamburg, Germany, to the United Nations Humanitarian Response Depot (UNHRD) in Dubai, UAE.

The aircraft, which is the 98th A380 to join the airline’s fleet, carried 1,020 tarpaulins and ropes required for the immediate first needs alleviation after a humanitarian crisis. The goods are among the ten most needed items in immediate humanitarian aid and will support 500 families. The tarpaulins and ropes can be used for replacing destroyed roofs, as temporary shelter in destroyed areas or even as water tanks.

Tim Clark, President, Emirates Airline said: “Emirates’ longstanding partnership with Airbus to support humanitarian organisations in transporting goods and aid to disaster stricken areas highlights the essential role that aviation plays in addressing humanitarian emergencies and supporting relief operations. We are proud to work with the Airbus Foundation and Welthungerhilfe to ferry these important relief supplies on our 98th A380 bound for Dubai, which will reach the regions and people who need it the most.”

Till Wahnbaeck, Chief Executive Director of Welthungerhilfe emphasized:” Our successful response to emergency situations relies on strong and reliable partners and professional preparation. This flight is an example how different partners can make a difference to save lives in emergency assistance.

Tom Enders, CEO of Airbus and Chairman of the Airbus Foundation said: “We are very proud of our long-term partnership with Emirates supporting the humanitarian community. I would like to thank Emirates and Welthungerhilfe for making this flight possible. Continuously transporting relief goods to the UNHRD in Dubai using delivery flights is a great example of how aviation can be a real force for good.”

The goodwill flight is part of the cooperation between Emirates Airline and the Airbus Foundation which was created in 2013 to utilize future A380 Emirates deliveries for transporting humanitarian aid to the UNHRD. Since the start of the cooperation 125 tonnes of goods have been transported.

The IHC is an independent, humanitarian free-zone Authority hosting a community of members comprised of UN agencies, Non Profit Organisations, Intergovernmental Organisations and Commercial Companies. Strategically located near Dubai Al Makoum International Airport, the IHC is a large-scale logistical hub for humanitarian aid response to crisis-stricken areas. It was created in 2003 and made available by the Government of the UAE.

First A330neo successfully completes maiden flight - Airbus,"Thu, 19 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmJ1cy5jb20vZW4vbmV3c3Jvb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAxNy0xMC1maXJzdC1hMzMwbmVvLXN1Y2Nlc3NmdWxseS1jb21wbGV0ZXMtbWFpZGVuLWZsaWdodNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Three dedicated flight-test aircraft to perform all flight testing for both the A330-800 and A330-900 variants;

Development on track for A330-900 entry into service in the middle of 2018

The first of three A330neo Family development aircraft to fly – MSN1795, an A330-900 variant – has landed at Toulouse-Blagnac, France at 14:10 hrs local time after successfully completing its first flight which lasted 4 hours and 13 minutes. The aircraft was powered by the latest technology Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 turbofans.

The crew in the cockpit on board this flight comprised: Experimental Test Pilots Thierry BOURGES, Thomas WILHELM and Test-Flight Engineer Alain POURCHET. Meanwhile, monitoring the aircraft systems and performance in real-time at the flight-test-engineer’s (FTE) station are Jean-Philippe COTTET, Emiliano REQUENA ESTEBAN and Gert WUNDERLICH.

Fabrice Brégier, Airbus COO and President of Airbus Commercial Aircraft said: “Today’s first flight of the A330neo marks yet another milestone along the Airbus journey of continuous innovation.” He added: “My congratulations and thanks go to all the teams who have contributed to make today’s flight happen, and to our customers for choosing this very efficient and capable aircraft to give them market advantage. We look forward to a successful flight test campaign and entry into service of the A330neo in 2018.”

Airbus has developed a fast-paced development programme from launch to first A330neo delivery. This will comprise 1,100 flight hours for the A330-900 campaign – to achieve its EASA and FAA Type Certification around the middle of 2018. An additional 300 flight hours is also allocated for the A330-800’s own certification flight-test campaign – which will commence in due course. These respective campaigns will be performed in an ‘airline like’ environment, ensuring maximum aircraft maturity and reliability at entry into service (EIS) with A330-900 launch operator TAP Portugal. This phase will also define the mature aircraft documentation to be available for airline operators at EIS.

Overall, the full flight-test campaigns for both models will be performed by two A330-900s and one A330-800 respectively. To complement these dedicated flight-test aircraft, the first production A330-900 aircraft will also be tasked to validate the full Airspace cabin.

Launched in July 2014, the A330neo is the latest generation in Airbus' market-leading A330 product line, comprising two versions: the A330-800 and A330-900. Both of these widebody aircraft incorporate new Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, nacelle, titanium pylon, new wings and an Airspace by Airbus Cabin. The most visible new features of the A330neo are the new wing span extensions to 64m total (up from the CEO’s 60.3m span) and the specially developed curved wingtip Sharklets – which draw on A350 XWB technology. Less visible, but equally important is the implementation of enhanced 3D-optimised aerodynamic refinements along the overall wing profile. Meanwhile, the Trent 7000s deliver double-digit fuel burn improvements and the quietest operation thanks to latest technology components, materials, new ‘zero-splice’ inlet and composite nacelle, ‘fully-faired’ pylon and also the larger (112-inch diameter) slower-rotating front fan with a bypass ratio of 10:1 – compared with the typical 5:1 ratio of previous-generation turbofans.

Both the A330-800 and the A330-900 will accommodate up to 10 more passengers than their respective predecessors, thanks to their new Airspace interiors which introduce various cabin enablers to free-up more usable cabin space – thus ensuring that each passenger can enjoy a significantly better actual comfort level and in-flight experience versus that offered by any competing aircraft in its market sector. The larger A330-900 will accommodate up to 287 seats in a typical three-class layout, while the A330-800 typically will seat 257 passengers in three classes.

To date 12 customers have placed orders for a total of 212 A330neos.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9468711614608765}",neutral,0.9468711614608765,0
The story of Whistleblower Ian Foxley's escape from Saudi Arabia - Business Insider,"Tue, 31 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vd2hpc3RsZWJsb3dlci1pYW4tZm94bGV5LWFsbGVnZWQtYWlyYnVzLWNvcnJ1cHRpb24tMjAxNy0xMNIBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vd2hpc3RsZWJsb3dlci1pYW4tZm94bGV5LWFsbGVnZWQtYWlyYnVzLWNvcnJ1cHRpb24tMjAxNy0xMD9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ian Foxley blew the whistle on what he claims was a multi-million-pound bribery scheme at Airbus in Saudi Arabia.

After raising the alarm, Foxley ran from an interview with his managing director and fled to a safe house.

The Serious Fraud Office has been investigating Foxley's claims of bribery at sub-contractors in Saudi Arabia.

LONDON – Retired Army officer Ian Foxley thought he had found his dream job overseeing a £1.96 billion ($2.6 billion) contract for upgrading defence telecommunications in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Instead, he uncovered what he believed was evidence of a multi-million-pound bribery scheme, and tried to blow the whistle, deciding to flee the country rather than risk staying.

Foxley served in the British Army for 24 years, before moving to telecommunications in the private sector.

In 2010, he found a job advert in the Sunday Times for an operations director at defence contractor GPT (now Airbus), and in June of that year touched down in Saudi Arabia to start work on a 10-year project for the Saudi Arabian National Guard. Foxley became the programme director on a project to provide satellite communications and a defence intranet for the Saudi Arabian National Guard, work that the the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) contracted out to GPT as part of a memo of understanding between the UK and Saudi governments.

Having worked in the private and public sectors, built two fibre-optic networks, and an intranet, he says, he was confident there was ""nothing in this project I didn't know about.""

But Foxley soon discovered he was the third director in six months — and by December, he too was gone. Not long after he arrived, he says, ""things started building in a kind of adversarial way, because things didn't smell right.""

This is the story of how Foxley uncovered what he claims was a systemic scheme at Airbus to bribe Saudi officials, which is now being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO).

An Airbus spokesperson told Business Insider, ""the UK's SFO is conducting a formal investigation in connection with aspects of the business of GPT Special Project Management Limited in Saudi Arabia which is a local subsidiary of Airbus conducting business exclusively for the UK MoD. We continue to fully and constructively engage with the SFO but in view of the investigation will not be commenting further.""

""Things started getting nasty""

At a meeting with Business Insider in London, Foxley is smartly dressed in a navy suit, and carrying a camouflage-pattern umbrella, a nod to his military past.

Not long after starting work in Saudi Arabia, he says he came across a large payment for ""bought in services"" in the first major GPT project he was required to sign off.

He was told these were outsourced services, but the cost was £1.6 million, more than that of the prime contractor's fee. Across the total £1.96 billion contract, he says, ""bought in services"" accounted for 16% of the costs, making them his biggest sub-contractor ""by volume of payment.""

This mystery contractor, he remembers thinking, was ""not giving me any service. They're not giving me any product. I've never seen them, I've never met any of them, I've never even heard of them.""

This was his ""'oh shit' moment,"" he says. He started asking questions, and ""things started getting nasty.""

Foxley says he now suspects there were sub-contractor fees hidden in every project in GPT contracts going back to 1978. He estimates the contracts' overall worth since then at around £5 billion: ""if you tot up 16% of £5 billion, you should be looking for something in the region of £750 million [in ""bought in services"" payments],"" he says. These unexplained payments, he alleges, were bribes for Saudi officials.

After doing some digging — which included talking to the company's former financial controller, a man he says he'd been told was ""mad"" and who had previously tried to blow the whistle — Foxley got hold of documents he says prove a history of bribes totalling millions of pounds, and sent them to a Ministry of Defence (MoD) brigadier he knew in Riyadh.

Later that day he received a phone call from his managing director, who called him into his office. The head of HR, a Saudi princess, was also there. The director, who knew Foxley had emailed the documents to the MoD, questioned his suspicions, and the discussion grew heated.

According to Foxley, the director then threatened to have him arrested for theft of confidential information.

""I thought to myself, 'you're stuffed,' because if a Saudi princess rings the police here and accuses you of theft, you've got no get-out, you're dead in the water,"" he says. So he said, ""this conversation isn't going anywhere,"" and walked out.

Foxley describes swiping through secure doors at the military base with his key card, the director shouting at him from behind. When he finally got outside he called the brigadier, who sent out a military vehicle to collect him.

The James Bond-style escape from Saudi Arabia

""This is where things get a bit James Bond-y,"" he smiles.

Having collected some essentials from his house — which was ""effectively like a luxurious penitentiary"" — Foxley bumped into a colleague who'd been sent out as part of a group to look for him. Luckily, he says, the man owed him a favour. ""I said, give me 10 minutes. And that was enough time for me to get out of the compound and lose the tail.""

Foxley was taken to a safe house, and an army Colonel drove him to the airport later that night. As they said goodbye at passport control, the colonel said, ""if they've put a stop and hold [on your passport] they'll grab you here. I'll go up onto the platform and I'll watch. My first call is to the Ambassador, my second is to the brigadier. Good luck.""

Foxley steeled himself, presented his passport, and was let through. He waited until the plane was clear of Riyadh, then ordered a large whiskey and ""collapsed.""

Back in the UK, he spent a few days writing a report of his findings, which he sent to two ""trusted sources"" in 2010, with instructions to send it straight to the SFO if anything ""happened to him,"" noting, ""I'm not suicidal, by the way.""

Foxley's report is currently sitting with the SFO, which said last year it had opened an investigation into possible fraud, bribery and corruption at Airbus. No charges have yet been brought, but Foxley expects action to be taken in the next six months, before SFO Director David Green retires in April.

Whether charges are brought, against whom and for what crimes, remains to be seen. According to Foxley, an added complication is that the GPT/Airbus contracts, which are still active, must have been approved by someone senior within the MoD; the original agreement was between the British and Saudi governments, although it was GPT/Airbus that carried out the work.

A MoD spokesperson said, ""we understand that the SFO is conducting a criminal investigation into allegations concerning GPT Special Project Management and aspects of the conduct of their business in Saudi Arabia. It would be inappropriate to comment while that is ongoing.""

The SFO declined to comment, since the investigation is ongoing.

Foxley is adamant action must be taken, in order to stamp out the notion that engaging in bribery is sometimes simply the ""cost of doing business.""

""How big do you have to be and how big does the client have to be to get away with it?"" he says, ""is it burglary or is it business?""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999855637550354}",neutral,0.999855637550354,0

“FlyScan sets a new standard of customer service based on true predictive maintenance: operators can anticipate formerly unscheduled events, avoid operational disruptions, and reach a new level of dispatch reliability,” said Matthieu Louvot, executive vice president of customer support at Airbus Helicopters. “It is one of the new services we offer our customers in line with our overarching goal to fully support them in safely and efficiently managing their operations.”

The HUMS system, a standard fixture on many Airbus Helicopters platforms, uses sensors placed throughout the aircraft to monitor key components and the overall behaviour of the machine. The system records large amounts of useful data, which is then transferred to various systems for interpretation. By effectively analyzing such data and providing proactive feedback, FlyScan helps customers to enhance flight safety, increase fleet availability, and reduce the maintenance burden by up to seven percent.

“With FlyScan Supervise, we know we will have reliable insight coming directly from the manufacturer itself on the details and operational statistics of our in-service fleet,” said Dominik Goldfuss, CEO of GHS. “It also provides a smart solution for less complex organisations so they no longer have to worry about developing these capabilities in-house, as Airbus takes care of everything.”

Three different levels of FlyScan are available for the H225, H175, H145, H135 and Dolphin fleets equipped with HUMS:

Advise , for customers already performing HUMS monitoring. HUMS experts from Airbus work in partnership with the customer to closely monitor the health parameters of their helicopters to better anticipate maintenance events;

FlyScan is part of the HCare Technical Support offer, providing 24/7 technical support, continuous airworthiness management and global technical assistance.

Additional FlyScan contracts are planned to conclude this year, and the company’s objective is for FlyScan to become a standard service for the entire helicopter HUMS community.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8690148591995239}",positive,0.8690148591995239,1
Delta Shows Off New Airbus A350 During the Delta Customer Experience Showcase - Metropolitan Airport News,"Mon, 23 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vbWV0cm9haXJwb3J0bmV3cy5jb20vZGVsdGEtc2hvd3Mtb2ZmLW5ldy1haXJidXMtYTM1MC1kZWx0YS1jdXN0b21lci1leHBlcmllbmNlLXNob3djYXNlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“On behalf of Delta, SkyTeam and our global partners, welcome aboard Flight 9988, the Customer Experience Showcase featuring the A350,” a flight attendant announced Tuesday to a plane filled with more than 70 journalists from around the world.

The media event, hosted by Delta’s Corporate Communications team at Delta’s headquarters in Atlanta, gave reporters, editors and bloggers from 18 countries and 65 outlets a first look at the airline’s new international flagship aircraft, the Airbus A350 – including a brief flight. Reporters also heard from leaders and employees about Delta’s multi-billion dollar investments in the customer experience.

Delta is the North American launch customer for the A350, which redefines the international onboard experience with the award-winning Delta One suite, the new Delta Premium Select cabin and a Main Cabin with an enhanced feel. The A350 enters into service this month.

Gareth Joyce, Senior Vice President – Airport Customer Service & President – Cargo, told reporters that the airline’s investment in the new aircraft, and in the overall travel journey, is about creating a better experience for customers.

“Our goal is to create powerful memories for our customers to take home with them,” Joyce said. To that end, innovation and customer service work hand in hand, he explained.

“The power of culture is the one thing competitors can never compete with us on. By using innovative technologies, we free our people up to have more meaningful interactions with customers.”

During the two-day event, Delta invited media to experience the airline’s recent investments: testing the new Self-Service Bag Drop, tasting food regularly served on the A350’s routes and, of course, flying on the aircraft in the Delta One and Delta Premium Select cabins.

“The A350 sets a whole new standard for aircraft,” Chief Operating Officer Gil West told the reporters. “It offers a 20 percent improvement in operation costs per seat and 25 percent increase in fuel efficiency compared to comparable aircraft.”

Reporters also heard from Lisa Bauer, Vice President – On-board Services, and Andrew Wingrove, Managing Director – Product and Customer Experience, who gave a behind-the-scenes look at developing Delta’s flagship product on the A350 and elevating the onboard experience.

Onboard, reporters had a chance to inspect every detail, from the customizable ambient lighting in the Delta One suite to the six-way adjustable headrest in Main Cabin. Several journalists shared observations about the A350 on social media.​​

Journalists also got the scoop on a number of announcements, including Delta’s plan to reinvent international Main Cabin dining, offer customers the option of pre-selecting meals and the A350’s new routes.

“Well, we just got a bit of great news – in addition to Tokyo, Beijing and Seoul, Delta’s flagship plane will soon begin flying to Europe, too,” The Points Guy wrote.

Media also took note of the Delta Premium Select cabin, which is making its debut on the A350:

“The seats are not simply coach seats with extra legroom,” wrote USA Today. “Instead, they’re entirely different seats that come with extended recline and footrests. The Premium Select seats also come with perks like enhanced meal service, priority check-in and amenity kits.”

Once the flight was wheels up, media onboard were given the full Delta treatment: sparkling wine, espresso and ice cream sundaes. The two-hour flight flew from Atlanta, north along the Appalachian Mountains before turning south toward Atlanta.

“(The A350) is part of our story about reliability, innovation and service, and how we’re going to make this a better airline,” Delta CEO Ed Bastian told the reporters the next morning. “We’re constantly focused on improving … it’s the ‘Keep Climbing’ motive that keeps us going.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.6970635056495667}",positive,0.6970635056495667,1

The aircraft lifted off from Toulouse Blagnac Airport in front of invited airline customers, suppliers and media. It landed after a successful four-hour mission.

We’ll take the opportunity to look at the A330neo changes and its flight test program. We also look at the drag reducing changes from A330ceo to A330neo.

The A330neo changes

The A330neo program started three years ago. The A330-300 and -200 get new engines/nacelles/pylons, an upgraded wing and a new cabin interior, Figure 1.

The initial Max Take-Off Weight is the same as the A330ceo, 242t. An upgrade program will bring this to 251t in 2020. This will increase the range of the A330-900 to 7,000nm.

Normal for an Airbus neo program is new engines with their nacelles. The A330neo engines are larger (112-inch fan for the Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 instead of 97 inches for the Trent 700). Therefore the nacelles are mounted higher relative to the wing.

This necessitates extensive flow analysis to avoid interference drag between wing and pylon/nacelle, Figure 2.

Interference drag is when the flow of air gets squeezed, so the local flow accelerates to supersonic flow. This creates supersonic shock wave drag. Therefore, such changes are carefully analyzed with CFD (Computer Fluid Dynamics) software tools.

Different to the A320neo program, the A330neo wing is extensively upgraded, Figure 3.

The wingspan has been extended with 3.7 meters to reduce induced drag. Induced drag is the drag due to weight. The lower pressure on the wings over-side sucks the higher-pressure air on the underside, up around the wing tips. There is a large vortex carpet left behind the aircraft (Figure 4), which consumes energy in its formation.

To lower induced drag, wingspan is increased, often with winglets. These use the vertical dimension to increase the effective span (the span the air sees).

For the A330neo, Airbus changed the A330 classical winglets to larger Sharklets, resembling the ones from A350. When the wingtips are changed; this changes the wing’s pressure distribution. To fine-tune the distribution for lowest drag, the wing’s twist and belly fairings are adapted so the span-wise pressure distribution comes close to an elliptical shape (the shape of lowest drag).

Airbus also cleaned up the first slat’s dog-tooth to remove interference drag and the flap track fairings shape to lower form drag (it’s a pressure drag, formed when the air can’t follow the shape of the fairing optimally).

Figure 5 shows different results from CFD runs to work on the drag improvement for the A330neo. The colors show areas of homogeneous pressure. By such tools, the designers can verify that they have reached the pressure distribution they seek for lowest drag.

The final picture is where the produced Sharklet is laser scanned to verify that the shape after productions is as designed.

Flight tests

The final verification of the changes for better engine performance and lower drag is done with flight tests. I was invited to watch the first flight for the A330neo yesterday in Toulouse.

The total program for the A330neo contains 1,100 flight hours. These shall be flown until next summer, after which the aircraft shall have its certification and be delivered to TAP Portugal.

The flight test program is flown with four aircraft, Figure 6. Two test aircraft do the A330-900 flight tests, followed by the first TAP Portugal aircraft, which will perform cabin and function + reliability testing before delivery. The final aircraft is the smaller A330-800 test aircraft.

Figure 7 show the test program in more detail.

The first aircraft (MSN 1795) starts with handling and flight envelope checks.This was the purpose of yesterday’s first flight, Figure 8. The aircraft took off at 09.57AM for a four-hour test flight, where the general handling in clean and landing configuration was checked. Because of the 200 invited guests (A330neo customer airlines, program partners/suppliers and media), the flight had to end at 14.00. So, the test team had four hours to accomplish as much as possible.

I spoke to Patrick du Che, Airbus SVP Flight and Integration tests, after the flight. He was pleased the aircraft could clear the full speed envelope from Stall to Max speed (Vmo at 340kts) and Max Mach (Mmo at 0.86) in this one sortie.

The aircraft also cycled landing gear and all movables positions (slats, flaps, spoilers). During the flight, the pilots also tested Fly-By-Wire direct mode (fly by electric wire) and normal mode (fly with computers in the loop).

The A330neo’s certification development programme itself will last around 1,400 flight-test hours. This will comprise 1,100 flight hours for the A330-900 campaign – to achieve its respective EASA and FAA Type Certification around the middle of 2018; plus 300 flight hours for A330-800 version – which will be certified in 2019. Overall, the full A330neo Family flight-test campaign will be performed by three certification flight-test aircraft, plus the first production aircraft (the latter to validate the Airspace cabin prior to EIS).

Launched in July 2014, the latest generation of Airbus’ widebody family, the A330neo builds on the A330’s proven economics, versatility and reliability while reducing fuel consumption by a further 14 per cent per seat. The NEO’s two versions – the A330-800 and A330-900 – will accommodate 257 and 287 passengers respectively in a three-class seating layout, are powered by the latest-generation Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, accommodate up to 10 more seats, offer new “Airspace” cabin amenities, and feature a new larger span wing with Sharklet wingtip devices.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999878406524658}",neutral,0.9999878406524658,0
"Bombardier raises hopes Airbus deal could save 1,000 jobs in Belfast - The Guardian","Tue, 17 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDE3L29jdC8xNy9ib21iYXJkaWVyLWFpcmJ1cy1kZWFsLWpvYnMtYmVsZmFzdC1ib2VpbmctYy1zZXJpZXPSAWRodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAxNy9vY3QvMTcvYm9tYmFyZGllci1haXJidXMtZGVhbC1qb2JzLWJlbGZhc3QtYm9laW5nLWMtc2VyaWVz?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bombardier has raised hopes of safeguarding 1,000 jobs in Belfast, saying it was confident a deal for Airbus to take a majority stake in the C-Series jet programme would help it avoid punishing US import tariffs.

The two companies hope to circumvent the 300% import tariff by assembling the C-Series passenger jets destined for US customers at Airbus’s factory in Alabama.

Should the deal proceed, the manufacture of wings for the C-Series is expected to remain in Belfast, where 1,000 people are employed on the programme. Bombardier employs a further 3,000 people in Belfast on other projects.

“Bombardier remains committed to our Northern Ireland operations,” a spokesperson for the company said. “This deal allows us to continue to support the jobs associated with the C-Series in Belfast and gives us more stability.”

The Canadian company’s share price was up by nearly 20% in early trading on the Toronto stock exchange on Tuesday after the announcement of the Airbus deal.

It is the latest twist in a bitter trade row between Bombardier and Boeing, the American aircraft maker which complained that aid from the Canadian and UK governments amounted to illegal subsidy, allowing Bombardier to sell its C-Series jets at “absurdly low” prices in the US.

The complaint was upheld by the US Department of Commerce, which slapped the huge tariff on the Montreal-based company, putting a contract with US airline Delta and the whole C-Series programme at risk.

“Assembly in the US can resolve the issue,” said Alain Bellemare, the chief executive of Bombardier, of the steep import levy in the US, adding that the two companies hoped to finalise the deal within six to 12 months.



However, Boeing warned that its two rivals should “think again” if they believed the deal would allow them to avoid the levy.

Phil Musser, Boeing’s senior vice-president of communications, tweeted:

If @Airbus and @Bombardier think this deal will get them around the rules....#thinkagain — Phil Musser (@pmusser) October 17, 2017

Boeing added in a separate statement: “This looks like a questionable deal between two heavily state-subsidised competitors to skirt the US government findings. Everyone should play by the same rules for free and fair trade to work.”

Unite, the UK’s largest union, welcomed the partnership between Bombardier and Airbus but cautioned it was not 100% satisfied that jobs in Northern Ireland were secure.

“This news gives us cause to have some hope, but we are far from out of the woods and there is still much work to do to secure Bombardier jobs in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK,” said Steve Turner, assistant general secretary at Unite with responsibility for aerospace.



“The deal could take a year or so to get through the relevant competition authorities while Boeing in the US is unlikely to sit idly by. During this period there is a danger that tariffs will be imposed and the C-Series will be effectively locked out of aviation’s largest market.”

The business secretary, Greg Clark, said the partnership was “a very big step forward” in safeguarding Bombardier jobs in Belfast.

“Not only has Airbus committed to Belfast being the home of the wing manufacturer for the C-Series, but they are pointing to the possibility of expanding the output and the order book,” he said.

Clark added that he would continue to work with the Canadian government to fight the Boeing complaint.

Under the terms of the new partnership, Airbus would take a 50.1% stake in the C-Series programme. It would leave Bombardier with about 31%, while the financier Investissement Québec would own about 19%.

Boeing complained to US authorities in April that aid received by Bombardier from the Canadian and UK governments amounted to illegal subsidies, allowing it to sell its C-Series jets to the US airline Delta at below cost price.

Delta has placed a $5.6bn (£4.2bn) order for up to 125 of the new aircraft, with delivery due to begin next year.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996044039726257}",neutral,0.9996044039726257,0
Airbus Helicopters hands over first H145 for Midlands Air Ambulance Charity - Vertical Magazine,"Wed, 04 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vdmVydGljYWxtYWcuY29tL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2VzL2FpcmJ1cy1oZWxpY29wdGVycy1oYW5kLWZpcnN0LWgxNDUtbWlkbGFuZHMtYWlyLWFtYnVsYW5jZS1jaGFyaXR5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus Helicopters formally handed over the first H145 for Midlands Air Ambulance Charity (MAAC) operated by Babcock Mission Critical Services (MCS) at an official ceremony at Helitech.

The event — attended by senior representatives of Airbus Helicopters, MAAC and Babcock MCS — marked the latest milestone in Airbus Helicopters’ support for U.K. Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS) operations.

The aircraft, which has been acquired by MAAC to further extend their HEMS operations, will see Babcock MCS provide the Bucher medical interior as well as operate the aircraft on behalf of the charity. The new addition to MAAC’s fleet, which is equipped with Airbus Helicopters’ Helionix advanced avionics and autopilot suite, has a maximum range of more than 403 nautical miles and a maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of 3700 kilograms.

Until now, MAAC’s fleet has been made up of three EC135 helicopters; the increase in range, payload and space that the H145 brings will help MAAC’s increase and extend HEMS operations across a larger region.

Colin James, managing director of Airbus Helicopters in the U.K. said, “The handover of this aircraft is the latest evolution of our close collaboration and partnership approach to supporting critical services in the U.K. With the H145, Babcock is set to provide a cutting-edge solution to Midlands Air Ambulance Charity, which will benefit from an aircraft that, time and again, has proved to be the ideal platform for U.K. HEMS operations.”

This will be the 10th H145 to operate in U.K. HEMS when it enters service with MAAC which, with 25 percent of the market, makes it the second most popular aircraft for these missions after the EC135.

Unlike its competitors, the H145 combines a spacious cabin and flat floor (easily accommodating patient, relative and paramedic, as well as the latest medical equipment) with large payload and range. Rear, clam shell doors ensure easy access for stretcher-borne patients, while the aircraft’s outstanding performance delivers the highest availability and lowest operating cost of any aircraft in its category.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.520381510257721}",neutral,0.520381510257721,0
"Boeing slams Airbus, Bombardier deal as means to 'skirt' US trade findings - Fox Business","Tue, 17 Oct 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL2JvZWluZy1zbGFtcy1haXJidXMtYm9tYmFyZGllci1kZWFsLWFzLW1lYW5zLXRvLXNraXJ0LXVzLXRyYWRlLWZpbmRpbmdz0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL21hcmtldHMvYm9laW5nLXNsYW1zLWFpcmJ1cy1ib21iYXJkaWVyLWRlYWwtYXMtbWVhbnMtdG8tc2tpcnQtdXMtdHJhZGUtZmluZGluZ3MuYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"European airplane manufacturer Airbus announced it would take a majority stake in Canadian plane maker Bombardier’s C-Series jet program on Monday, a deal viewed by Airbus’ main competitor – Boeing (NYSE:BA) – as a way to potentially sidestep recent findings by U.S. trade courts.

Airbus has acquired a 50.01% stake in the Bombardier’s C-Series jet platform, a narrower plane that Airbus sees as having significant future growth potential, giving Bombardier a new platform for its product outside of the U.S.

Boeing Reaction

In a statement, Boeing suggested Airbus and Bombardier were attempting to dodge a ruling by a U.S. trade court made earlier this month.

“This looks like a questionable deal between two heavily state-subsidized competitors to skirt the recent findings of the U.S. government,” a company spokesperson said late Monday. “Our position remains that everyone should play by the same rules for free and fair trade to work.”

Between the last week of September and the first week of October, the U.S. Commerce Department hit Canadian jetliners with two tariffs cumulatively valued at about 300%, siding with Boeing in its complaint that Bombardier was unloading jets into the U.S. market at unfairly low prices.

The complaint was in regards to a deal made in 2016 between Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and Bombardier for 75 C-Series jets.

If the tariffs are upheld by the U.S. International Trade Commission, it could price Bombardier out of the U.S. market completely, according to some experts.

Neither Bombardier nor Airbus immediately responded to FOX Business’ requests for comments about Boeing’s suggestion that the recent deal was made to circumvent the U.S. ruling.

Delta confirmed in a statement that its order for 75 Bombardier jets is still on schedule.

The Deal

Airbus is essentially putting no equity into the deal with Bombardier, though it will be responsible for commercial sales and marketing. Meanwhile, Bombardier has agreed to finance up to $700 million for any near-term funding needs, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Airbus and Boeing have largely held a duopoly on the commercial aerospace industry and some believe Airbus’ deal with Bombardier could shake up the sector.

About the C-Series

The C-Series jet is a single-aisle aircraft that seats between 100-150 passengers. In a press release, Airbus said “the single aisle market” could represent as much as 70% of future global demand for aircraft. Bombardier said it believes the smaller jetliner could “represent more than 6,000 new aircraft over the next 20 years.”

By comparison, Boeing’s 737 Next-Generation family of jets seats about 150-220 passengers.

On Tuesday morning, shares of Boeing were down less than 1%, while Bombardier was up nearly 20% and Airbus rose more than 3%.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998743534088135}",neutral,0.9998743534088135,0
