Airbus lawsuit details sharklet patent dispute | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Wed, 14 Dec 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWxhd3N1aXQtZGV0YWlscy1zaGFya2xldC1wYXRlbnQtZGlzcHV0ZS8xMDM0MjUuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus's lawsuit against Seattle-based winglet specialist Aviation Partners follows a claim by the US company that the airframer should pay royalties over its own wing-tip design. The two sides had worked closely during a period when Airbus assessed the Aviation Partners blended winglet for the Airbus A320.

Aviation Partners filed the patent for its winglet in February 1993, and it was issued the following year, but Airbus has since created its own ""sharklet"" wing-tip, which it will offer to customers next year and which will become a standard fit on the re-engined A320neo.

""In written and oral communications with Airbus, [Aviation Partners] has stated repeatedly that Airbus's winglet design falls within the claims of [its] patent, and that Airbus must therefore pay [Aviation Partners] a royalty for its allegedly infringing design,"" the formal complaint states.

The lawsuit, dated 1 December, has been brought before the US district court for the western district of Texas. Aviation Partners' original patent describes the blended winglet as featuring a ""critical departure"" from regular winglet designs, which are hampered by ""sharp corners"" and rapid changes in chord.

""The object of the present invention is to provide a winglet configuration concept which includes an efficient transition between the wing and the winglet, which maintains a near-optimum loading over a substantial range of operating conditions, thereby achieving the full drag-reduction potential of the wing-tip device,"" it said.

It added that the leading-edge curve provides a smooth, gradual chord variation and limits the leading-edge sweep to less than 65° - necessary to avoid vortex shedding, which would compromise surface loading and increase drag.

The Airbus lawsuit argued that Aviation Partners, by demanding royalties, is directly charging the airframer with infringing this patent. ""[Aviation Partners'] threats are a significant hindrance to Airbus and, without an early resolution, place Airbus at a competitive disadvantage,"" it added. ""Under all the circumstances, [Aviation Partners'] threats and actions show that it is prepared and willing to enforce [its] patent against Airbus and that there is substantial live controversy between [the two companies], having adverse legal interests of sufficient immediacy to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgement.""

Aviation Partners said it was ""surprised"" at the legal action by Airbus, particularly given the previous close co-operation between them during tests of the US company's winglets on A320s. It added that it would ""vigorously protect"" its patented technology.

Mexican Air Force takes delivery of Airbus Military C295 - Indian Defence Review,"Tue, 13 Dec 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhbmRlZmVuY2VyZXZpZXcuY29tL25ld3MvbWV4aWNhbi1haXItZm9yY2UtdGFrZXMtZGVsaXZlcnktb2YtYWlyYnVzLW1pbGl0YXJ5LWMyOTUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"



The Mexican Air Force has taken delivery of a new C295 aircraft that it ordered from Airbus Military. This order is in addition to the five C295s delivered last year and that the Mexican Secretary of Defence already operates.

The primary use of the aircraft will be transport of troops and paratroops. It can also be readily configured for medical evacuation (MEDEVAC) or can carry up to nine tonnes of palletized or bulk cargo.

The capabilities of the C295 aircraft make it ideal for military missions, both tactical and logistic, as well as for civic/humanitarian missions in which its short take-off and landing (STOL) abilities are essential to provide access to remote locations.

“When a customer comes back, that is due to the high quality of the product. We are proud to provide the Mexican Air Force a new C295 to keep on fulfilling the most demanding requirements from the Mexican Secretary of Defence”, said Airbus Military Head of Programmes, Rafael Tentor.

The Mexican Air Force, Navy, and Federal Police have acquired products from the entire family of Airbus Military Light and Medium aircraft including: ten C295 (including this latest delivery), seven CN235 (six of them in Maritime Patrol version), and ten C212 (eight of them in Maritime Patrol version)."
When is a winglet a sharklet? - Maclean's,"Mon, 19 Dec 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vbWFjbGVhbnMuY2EvZWNvbm9teS9idXNpbmVzcy9hdmlhdGlvbi1pbmR1c3RyeS1vbi1hLXdpbmctYW5kLXRpcC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Next time you’re seated in the window seat of an airplane, take a close look at the wings—chances are you will see a fin-like airfoil protruding from the tip. Winglets, as they’re called, have been fitted to airliners since the ’80s, but Airbus has come up with a new name for them: “sharklets.” It’s part of an effort to escape a patent on the increasingly important technology that’s held by a close partner of Airbus’s main rival, Boeing.

To the naked eye, the difference between sharklets and winglets is in name only. Their purpose is to cut down on fuel—between 3.5 to seven per cent—by reducing aerodynamic drag, which they do by literally slashing through the air. The best bang for the buck is in mid- to long-range flights, when cruising speed is sustained for longer periods, consequently compensating for the winglets’ added weight.

In the Airbus versus Boeing battle, modern winglets have become a selling point for customer airlines under pressure to find greater fuel savings. Airbus will install its 2.5-m sharklets on its popular A320s, which are beating its Boeing competitor, the winglet-fitted 737, by the hundreds in firm orders in 2011.

Airbus says that Aviation Partners Inc. (which operates a joint venture firm with Boeing) has demanded Airbus pay royalties for infringing on its latest winglet designs. Airbus filed a complaint in the U.S., arguing the “threats are a significant hindrance” that put it at a competitive disadvantage. Joe Clark, the co-founder and CEO of API, said in a statement his company was surprised by the lawsuit “after working closely with Airbus over the past five years.” He said API has tested winglets on a JetBlue Airways A320 “with the co-operation of Airbus,” adding it will “vigorously protect” its technology, “which is currently saving the world billions of gallons of fuel.”

Whether they’re called sharklets or winglets, those wing tips are no small matter.

Battle to be the best-selling plane: Boeing 737 MAX v the Airbus A320neo - Sydney Morning Herald,"Tue, 20 Dec 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zbWguY29tLmF1L3RyYXZlbGxlci9pbnNwaXJhdGlvbi9iYXR0bGUtdG8tYmUtdGhlLWJlc3Qtc2VsbGluZy1wbGFuZS1ib2VpbmctNzM3LW1heC12LXRoZS1haXJidXMtYTMyMG5lby0yMDExMTIxOS0xcDFmaS5odG1s0gGIAWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNtaC5jb20uYXUvdHJhdmVsbGVyL2luc3BpcmF0aW9uL2JhdHRsZS10by1iZS10aGUtYmVzdC1zZWxsaW5nLXBsYW5lLWJvZWluZy03MzctbWF4LXYtdGhlLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzIwbmVvLTIwMTExMjE5LTFwMWZpLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"""Right now, the stage is set for 50/50. You look at the numbers,"" said Teal Group aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia. ""You look at loyalty and so far there's been a very high level of loyalty displayed by customers on both sides."" Airbus orders include 200 aircraft from AirAsia, an all-Airbus customer, while Boeing signed up its loyal Asian customer Lion Air of Indonesia for 201 737 MAX aircraft. The difference of just one plane illustrates the fierce rivalry between the two Asian low-cost carriers as well as their entrepreneur owners. ""I think you're going to see a tremendous run-up in orders of the next six to 12 months,"" Aboulafia said. IT COMES DOWN TO ENGINES The 737 MAX, due to enter service in 2017, will be powered by CFM International engines and promises to reduce burn and carbon dioxide emissions by 10 to 12 per cent current single-aisle planes. CFM International is a joint venture between General Electric and Safran.

Boeing says the plane also will have lower operating costs. The A320neo is due to enter service in 2016, featuring engine options from Pratt & Whitney, a unit of US manufacturer United Technologies, or CFM International. Airbus maintains its aircraft is more cost efficient. List prices for the MAX range from $US78 million to $US101.7 million. This compares with $US84 million to $US106 million for the three A320neo models. ""Either people are taking two different roads to the same result. Or someone's right and someone's wrong,"" Aboulafia said. ""The only difference is that Airbus is hedged because they've got a choice of both engines,"" he said.

Neal Dihora, an aerospace analyst at Morningstar, said Airbus still has a marketing advantage over Boeing simply because it started selling its plane earlier. Airbus unveiled its A320neo plans in December last year. ""Airbus is winning this contest because they're showing that they have a product and the ability to actually get these fuel savings into the market place as opposed to just in the design phase,"" Dihora said. Boeing has yet to publicise the specs for its upgraded 737, but Albaugh said it is appropriate to view the aircraft as a replacement for the 737 Next Generation. The current 737 models are the domestic workhorses for many airline customers, seating between 110 and 220 people for short- and medium-haul flights. The largest model of the MAX, the -900, can serve as a replacement for the discontinued 757 on most routes, Albaugh said. ""The 900 is an plane that in our view can do over 95 percent of the missions that the 757 did,"" he said.

""In terms of a one-for-one replacement of the 57, it's not one for one, but it's pretty close,"" Albaugh added. HOW BOEING ARRIVED AT ITS DECISION TO RE-ENGINE Until its surprise decision to re-engine the 737 last northern summer, Boeing had made it clear that it preferred to build an all-new small plane to take the place of its 737 NG. The company took the heat from analysts as it dragged out a decision over whether to redesign or re-engine. And it stood by as Airbus notched more than a 1000 orders for its A320neo and made inroads into US markets. In July, Boeing finally bit the bullet and said it would re-engine the aircraft, a move many outsiders perceived as a reaction to interest by American Airlines, a loyal Boeing customer, in buying the A320neo.

American, which is restructuring after filing for bankruptcy protection, split its giant order for 460 single-aisle jets worth up to $40 billion between Boeing and Airbus. In the Reuters interview, Albaugh said there were more considerations than American and that Boeing arrived at its decision on its own terms after consultation with customers. ""Everybody liked the idea of a new plane. But they wanted an plane with certainty on a precise date, and they also wanted to understand what the guarantees of that plane might be,"" Albaugh said. He said Boeing was confident it could build the plane and provide 20 per cent improvement in efficiency. ""But what we weren't confident of was what the nonrecurring costs would have been for development,"" he said."
Plane dive passengers win payout from Airbus - WAtoday,"Wed, 21 Dec 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhdG9kYXkuY29tLmF1L25hdGlvbmFsL3dlc3Rlcm4tYXVzdHJhbGlhL3BsYW5lLWRpdmUtcGFzc2VuZ2Vycy13aW4tcGF5b3V0LWZyb20tYWlyYnVzLTIwMTExMjIwLTFwM283Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Almost 150 passengers who were on the terrifying Qantas flight to Perth which plunged 150 feet in two seconds three years ago have won millions of dollars in damages from Airbus and aerospace technology giant Northrop Grumman.

Lawyers for another 16 passengers who suffered the most severe injuries in the plunge – most of whom are from Western Australia - are preparing to launch a multimillion dollar law suit in the US after failing to reach a settlement with the companies.

'All of a sudden the plane dropped and I was thrown, everybody was screaming, everything was thrown up in the air,' Perth grandmother Dawn Mitchell said.

The revelation comes after the Australian Transport Safety Bureau this week released its report into the October 7, 2008 incident, which found the Airbus A330 dived twice unexpectedly after one of three airspeed sensors malfunctioned.

Passengers who weren't wearing seatbelts and crew members were thrown from their seats and hit the ceiling when the plane plunged 150 feet in two seconds, as part of a 690-feet, 23-second dive."
Qatar chief issues A330 freighter warning to Airbus - Flightglobal,"Thu, 01 Dec 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vcWF0YXItY2hpZWYtaXNzdWVzLWEzMzAtZnJlaWdodGVyLXdhcm5pbmctdG8tYWlyYnVzLzEwMzI4MC5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Qatar Airways has warned that Airbus risks missing out on a substantial part of the freighter sector by stalling on an A330 conversion.

Speaking during the Arab Air Carriers Organization conference in Abu Dhabi, Qatar chief executive Akbar Al Baker said he primarily wanted a conversion option for the carrier's A330-200s - the type for which Airbus is trying to offer a new-build freighter airframe.

""We're not going to buy [them],"" Al Baker insisted, and warned: ""What they're not realising is that, by not obliging, they're going to lose a very large market share.""

He pointed to the demand from FedEx as an indicator, and reiterated that Qatar Airways plans to hold talks with Boeing and other parties on obtaining converted 767 freighters.

While Qatar Airways does not operate the 767, Al Baker said that the carrier was not concerned about introducing another type to its fleet.

The wingtip devices will also enhance the aircraft’s performance.

Sharklets are around 2.5 meters tall and will replace the aircraft’s current wingtip fence. Offered as an option on new-build aircraft, Sharklets have been specially designed for the Airbus A320 Family to reduce fuel burn by up to an additional 3.5 percent, corresponding to an annual CO2 reduction of around 700 tons per aircraft.

December 1, 2011 - Airbus has completed the first flight of the ‘Sharklet’ wing-tip devices on the company’s A320 development aircraft (MSN 001). This milestone marks the start of the early flight-test campaign to capture data for fine-tuning the flight laws, as well as for certification and performance validation."
