Aircraft Design Inspired by Nature and Enabled by Tech - Smithsonian Magazine,"Thu, 16 Aug 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNtaXRoc29uaWFubWFnLmNvbS9hcnRzLWN1bHR1cmUvYWlyY3JhZnQtZGVzaWduLWluc3BpcmVkLWJ5LW5hdHVyZS1hbmQtZW5hYmxlZC1ieS10ZWNoLTI1MjIyOTcxL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As if it weren’t already mind-bending enough to envision yourself hurtling through the skies in a metal canister at 500 miles per hour, now Airbus wants you to imagine your gravity-defying journey in an aircraft with transparent skin. Tapping into some of the most cutting-edge design thinking today, the aviation leader has developed a concept plane that is not intended for flight—at least not in this iteration—but is an innovation tool that “stretches the imagination of engineers, and…highlights some of the challenges and decisions that lie ahead for air travel.”

The concept plane, which they hope resembles the real Airbus models of 2050, takes biomimicry as a guiding principle for the design of forms and materials. The most noticeable aspect of this approach is in the fuselage, which, instead of being wrapped in opaque steel, is composed of a web-like network of structural material that looks a bit like a skeleton. In fact, that’s exactly what it should remind you of, because it’s inspired by the bone structure of birds.

In a presentation on the company’s future design plans, chief engineer Charles Champion explained, “Bone is both light and strong because its porous interior carries tension only where necessary, leaving space elsewhere.” The space between the so-called “bionic bones”of the plane become panoramic windows that wrap all the way around. “ou will be able see the pyramids or the Eiffel Tower through the transparent floor of the aircraft.”

While the structural design is inspired by creatures that have existed for millennia, many of the materials are produced using technology that as barely been known for a decade. 3D-printing is one of the techniques that may enable Airbus to create the precise, spare forms they require, first drafting them on a computer and then manufacturing them through rapid layering that builds up the design exactly as it’s intended, with no waste. For the cabin’s electrical system, Airbus intends to integrate a brain-like “network of intelligence” into the walls of the plane, which is responsive to interior climate conditions and passenger needs without requiring huge amounts of cable, wire and switches.

All of these strategies—the lightweight structure, waste-free manufacturing, and wireless electrical systems—can contribute to reductions in emissions and fuel use. The cumulative effect of using fewer resources for each plane could result in a massive overall improvement in aviation’s environmental impact. In that vein, the Airbus concept plane is one of the few instances (at least for now), where the term “organically grown” refers not to food, but to seating. The seats of the plane will potentially be composed of plant-based biomaterials which go a few leaps past memory foam toward smart materials that form to and remember the body’s optimal position.

Of course all of the aspects of physical comfort and wellness that currently elude passengers will find their way into this in-flight experience, too, in the form of interactive zones, where travelers can socialize, play games, exercise and enjoy various holistic treatments like massage and aromatherapy. It’s almost enough to make you forget you’re trapped inside a pressurized container six vertical miles above your home planet.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999102354049683}",neutral,0.9999102354049683,0
Philippine Airlines to buy 54 Airbus jets - Hawaii News Now,"Tue, 28 Aug 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhhd2FpaW5ld3Nub3cuY29tL3N0b3J5LzE5NDAyMDcwL3BoaWxpcHBpbmUtYWlybGluZXMtdG8tYnV5LTU0LWFpcmJ1cy1qZXRzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By JIM GOMEZAssociated Press

MANILA, Philippines (AP) - Flag-carrier Philippine Airlines signed a $7 billion deal on Tuesday to buy 54 Airbus jets as part of an ambitious plan to overhaul its fleet to meet higher demands of transporting passengers and cargo in Asia, the Middle East and Australia, airline officials said.

PAL President Ramon Ang said the first batch of about a dozen wide-body A330-300s and A321s would be delivered in January while the rest of the aircraft would be put in service in the next three years.

The acquisition, the largest single aircraft order ever made by a Philippine carrier, would more than double the airline's passenger and cargo handling capacity and signals an expansion phase after Philippine food and beer conglomerate San Miguel Corp. acquired major stakes in PAL and its affiliate budget carrier Air Philippines Corp. earlier this year.

PAL also plans to buy another 46 aircraft from Airbus and other manufacturers, including Boeing, Ang told a news conference.

""The orders we are placing with Airbus will play a key role in revitalizing PAL and growing trade and tourism in the country,"" PAL chairman Lucio Tan said.

Twenty-6 of the 100 airplanes the airline wants to buy would be for long-distance journeys, like Manila to New York and to Paris, Ang said.

In Washington, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland suggested American officials have lobbied for Boeing to get the aircraft deal with PAL but added the awarding of the contract to Airbus would not affect Washington's relations with the Philippines, which has been bolstered in recent years.

Asked if the U.S. government lobbied for the Philippines to award the deal to Boeing over Airbus, Nuland said: ""We always advocate for U.S. companies, particularly when there's a big contract at stake.""

""But, you know, nations make sovereign decisions and they make them based on their own set of criteria,"" Nuland said.

A Philippine Airlines official said the company awarded the huge contract based purely on business criteria and without prejudice to any company. The official spoke on condition of anonymity for lack of authority to talk to reporters.

Associated Press writer Matthew Pennington contributed to this report from Washington.

Airbus Powers Up Cockpit of Its New Composite Airliner - WIRED,"Thu, 02 Aug 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS8yMDEyLzA4L2FpcmJ1cy1tc24xL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbus has turned on the power inside its new composite A350 XWB for the first time. The flight deck of the MSN1, the first flyable A350 XWB rolling down the assembly line, features an array of flat panel displays common in most modern airliners and the small side-stick controls familiar to Airbus pilots.

The A350 XWB is Airbus' competitor to the Boeing 777 and new Boeing 787 Dreamliner. And like the Dreamliner, the new Airbus has already suffered its share of setbacks. The company says turning on the power on the flight deck will allow them to perform functional checks of most systems, hopefully allowing them to spot any issues early enough to minimize further delays. The team expects to power up the entire airplane later in the summer and a first flight is scheduled for early next summer.

The front fuselage sections of the airplane was delivered to the final assembly line in Toulouse, France, last month inside the company's giant Beluga transport aircraft. Sections of the A350 XWB are assembled in the United Kingdom, Spain, France, and Germany with final assembly taking place in Toulouse.

The first airframe is designated for static structural testing, with MSN1 designated as the A350 XWB that will make the first flight. Currently Airbus is hoping the airplane will enter service in the second half of 2014.

Like the Boeing 787, much of the structure of the A350 XWB is made from composites. Though where Boeing uses a composite barrel to form the fuselage, Airbus is using composite panels attached to a metal frame.

Both Boeing and Airbus are promoting the new airplane's significant fuel efficiency improvements over comparable airliners.

Boeing's 787 began service late last year with All Nippon Airways. Both ANA and Japan Airlines are currently operating the airplane. United unveiled its 787 today and is expected to begin flying passengers with the new Dreamliner this fall. Over the weekend a new 787 assembled at the company's new South Carolina factory ignited a small grass fire after a piece of one of its engines fell to the ground. The company and the NTSB are investigating the incident.

The order includes 34 Airbus A321s, 10 Airbus A321neos and 10 of the new higher-weight Airbus A330-300s.

The aircraft, purchased as part of PAL's major fleet modernisation plan, are scheduled to be delivered starting in the second half of 2013. The first A321neo is expected to be delivered in 2017. Engine selections for the aircraft have not been announced.

PAL will operate the A321s on domestic and regional routes, enhancing the flag carrier's product, as well as support alliances with its partner airlines, it says in a statement.

The A330 widebodies will, meanwhile, be operated on ""higher demand regional routes"" and longer range services to the Middle East and Australia, PAL adds.

""The orders we are placing with Airbus will play a key role in revitalising PAL, while growing trade and tourism in the country,"" PAL chairman Lucio Tan said in a statement.

""With these aircraft, we will be able to offer more passengers the industry has to offer across out Asia-Pacific network. At the same time, we will benefit from the low operating costs associated with new generation aircraft and the reduced impact on the environment.""

Over the last few years, PAL has struggled to cope with the emergence of budget carrier Cebu Pacific, which now has the largest market share in the Philippines. The carrier had previously said that it wants to retire many of its older and uneconomical widebodies and replace them with a new fleet to compete more effectively on the long-haul markets. The aim is to purchase 100 new aircraft in total, PAL president Ramon Ang has reportedly said.

The order comes after Philippine conglomerate San Miguel Corp bought a 49% stake in the carrier with a $500 million injection earlier this year.

PAL operates a fleet of 38 aircraft with A319s, A320s, A330s, A340s, Boeing 747-400s and Boeing 777-300s.

Philippine Airlines Buys 54 Airbus Jets Worth $7 Billion - NYCAviation,"Wed, 29 Aug 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55Y2F2aWF0aW9uLmNvbS8yMDEyLzA4L3BoaWxpcHBpbmUtYWlybGluZXMtYnV5cy01NC1haXJidXMtamV0cy13b3J0aC03LWJpbGxpb24vMjUwMjLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"European aircraft manufacturer Airbus on Tuesday secured a $7 billion order from Philippine Airlines (PAL), beating American rival Boeing as they continue their global contest to increase their market share.

Philippine Airlines said it plans to buy up to 100 new aircraft over the next decade as it carries out a major fleet modernization program and restructures operations to become a low-cost carrier. The firm order announced Tuesday is for 10 long-haul A330-300 aircraft and 44 aircraft from the A321 family.

“The orders we are placing with Airbus will play a key role in revitalizing PAL and growing trade and tourism in the country,” PAL Chairman Lucio Tan and PAL President Ramon S. Ang said in a joint statement. “With these aircraft we will be able to offer more passengers the best the industry has to offer across our Asia-Pacific network. At the same time, we will benefit from the low operating costs associated with new generation aircraft and the reduced impact on the environment.”

According to Airbus, its aircraft in the A321 family offers the lowest operating costs of any single aisle product line today. These costs will be further reduced with the new engine option which the European aircraft manufacturer says will offer additional fuel savings of up to 15 percent.

“We are extremely pleased that Philippine Airlines has placed its confidence in our aircraft to meet its future requirements,” said John Leahy, Chief Operating Officer of Customers at Airbus. “This announcement demonstrates once again the popularity of both the A320 Family and the A330, which remain the leaders in their size categories in terms of operating economics, reliability and passenger comfort.”

The deal is valued at nearly $7.3 billion at list prices, but the actual cost is believed to be significantly lower as Airbus and Boeing are in a global contest for market share and have in some cases more than halved their prices. Philippine Airlines reportedly faced significant commercial and political pressure from the United States to secure a deal with Boeing.

Philippine Airlines is currently blacklisted from flying to the EU, and is on an FAA watchlist that prevents it from flying new routes or aircraft within the US, all due to safety concerns.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9996205568313599}",positive,0.9996205568313599,1

Airbus won a $7 billion order to help more than triple Philippine Airlines Inc’s fleet, beating Boeing to a deal despite U.S. support for Manila in a diplomatic dispute with China.The flag carrier, which plans to buy up to 100 new jets in total within the next five to seven years as it fights to regain dominance of the local market, said it was still in talks with both Airbus and Boeing for its next tranche of planes.For this stage of fleet expansion, the airline has ordered 10 long-haul A330-300s and 44 jets from the A321 family, with delivery starting in 2013, Asia’s oldest airline said in a statement. The carrier is ready to issue more shares to fund its jet purchases, it said.“The good Boeing planes we are looking at are the 777-300 ER and the upcoming 777-X. We’re also interested in the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner,” President Ramon Ang told reporters on the sidelines of the deal signing event in Manila on Tuesday.“We have the option on whichever type of aircraft to go,” he said.Boeing and Airbus are already locked in a global contest for market share, in some cases more than halving prices to bolster orders of the newly revamped models of best-selling narrowbody jets, industry sources and analysts say.A territorial spat in the South China Sea appears to have added a diplomatic dimension to the talks as Washington seeks to cement a growing alignment with Manila on the issue.

The Italian-based airline was founded in 2003 and operated scheduled service in Italy and to destinations in Europe, to Egypt and seasonally to Israel.

Wind Jet operated a fleet of five Airbus A319s and seven Airbus A320s in an all economy format.

In January 2012, Alitalia started the process of merging with Wind Jet. The Italian antitrust authority gave Alitialia authorization to move forward, but were told they would have to give up slots on some of their most important routes. Altalia decided to pull out of the merger and Wind Jet was not able to stay in business.

I have to say that I love this livery. The orange nose, engines and tail go well together. It is not just any livery that can pull off a white body and colored nose. Too bad it will be flying no longer.

Airbus A320 to Be Equipped With Hydrogen Fuel Cells for Increased Efficiency - The Green Optimistic,"Wed, 08 Aug 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWVub3B0aW1pc3RpYy5jb20vYWlyYnVzLWEzMjAtdG8tYmUtZXF1aXBwZWQtd2l0aC1oeWRyb2dlbi1mdWVsLWNlbGxzLWZvci1pbmNyZWFzZWQtZWZmaWNpZW5jeS0yMDEyMDgwOC_SAXpodHRwczovL3d3dy5ncmVlbm9wdGltaXN0aWMuY29tL2FpcmJ1cy1hMzIwLXRvLWJlLWVxdWlwcGVkLXdpdGgtaHlkcm9nZW4tZnVlbC1jZWxscy1mb3ItaW5jcmVhc2VkLWVmZmljaWVuY3ktMjAxMjA4MDgvP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Though the hydrogen fuel cells used nowadays are not powerful enough that commercial aircraft engines can be replaced by them, it doesn’t mean that they are not effective enough to make air travel more efficient. Airbus flight tests have shown 15% decreases in fuel consumption.

The environmental controls, entertainment system, and lights of the Airbus were powered with the hydrogen fuel cells. The test flights will be commenced in 2015 with the installation of a 90 kWh hydrogen fuel cell in the A320, which is owned by the German Aerospace Center.

The fuel cell will also power the hydraulics and avionics of the airbus. It will also help in maintaining a low level of oxygen in the tanks so remain safe during the flight. The current technology used in aircrafts involves the electrical power system. The produced electric power also separates the small turbine known as the auxiliary unit.

Michel Loignon, the engineering manager at Airbus has stated that with the use of the fuel cell the conversion of energy will become easier from chemical to electrical. He also further stated that they are working on the collection of different mature technologies and mixing them.

Nowadays the aircrafts are normally designed with larger engines, so they can accommodate additional power needs, resulting in the weight increase of the aircraft. With the use of hydrogen fuel cells, the auxiliary power unit will be removed and the power will be more efficiently generated.

Another advantage of using hydrogen fuel cells will be that they will efficiently reduce the amount of water carried by the aircraft at takeoff. Some large airlines have to carry 3,000 pounds of water and the savings will be made with the use of fuel cells. Manchester University Aerospace engineer William Crowther has also declared the use of the fuel cells as a good on a long term basis. He has also pointed out that with the hydrogen on board new safety challenges will also be introduced.

"Airbuses suffer cockpit power failure, await fixes - The Columbus Dispatch","Wed, 22 Aug 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpc3BhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDEyLzA4LzIyL2FpcmJ1c2VzLXN1ZmZlci1jb2NrcGl0LXBvd2VyLWZhaWx1cmUvMjM3Mjc4NTcwMDcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airbuses suffer cockpit power failure, await fixes

As United Flight 731 climbed out of Newark with 107 people aboard, the pilot and first officer were startled to find screens that display crucial navigational information were blank or unreadable and radios were dead.

They had no way to communicate with air traffic controllers or detect other planes around them in the New York City area's crowded airspace.

""I made a comment to the captain about steering clear of New York City, not wanting to get shot down by USAF fighters,"" first officer Douglas Cochran later told investigators. He wasn't joking: ""We both felt an extreme urgency to get this aircraft on the ground as soon as possible.""

Within minutes, Cochran and the captain had turned around and safely landed the Denver-bound Airbus A320 at the Newark airport. Cochran later told investigators that clear weather might have been the only thing that saved them from a crash.

The January 2008 emergency was far from the first such multiple electrical failure in what is known as the Airbus A320 family of aircraft, and it wasn't the last, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press. More than 50 episodes involving the planes, which first went into service more than two decades ago, have been reported.

And it could be another few years before the last of the thousands of narrow-body, twin-engine jets in use in the U.S. and overseas are modified to counteract the problem. The Federal Aviation Administration issued an order in 2010 giving U.S. airlines four years to make the fixes. The FAA's European counterpart did the same thing in 2009.

While no accidents have been blamed on the problem, the pilots union in the U.S. wanted the FAA to give airlines just two years to comply, but the FAA rejected that.

Aviation safety consultant Douglas Moss said the FAA should have acted a lot more quickly.

""These things cost money and the industry is in bad shape, so you have the economics thrown into it. But if the end result is higher airfares and higher cost of transportation, then that is the price we have to pay to ensure a safe transport system,"" said Moss, a California-based commercial pilot with 34 years' experience, including 14 years flying Airbuses.

A National Transportation Safety Board investigator said long time frames for fixing problems are not uncommon, because of the inconvenience involved in grounding planes for repairs. And FAA spokeswoman Allison Duquette said the four-year window was determined by the estimated 46 hours required to fix each jet. Safety regulators put the cost at $6,000 per plane.

The Airbus A320 family includes the A318, A319, A320 and A321 models - passenger jets with 100 to 220 seats.

France-based Airbus told NTSB investigators in 2008 that 49 electrical failures similar to the Newark emergency happened on its planes in the U.S. and abroad before that episode. Nearly half involved the loss of at least five of six cockpit displays.

Also, pilots who post to a website operated by NASA have described at least seven more instances of multiple electrical failure that forced them to abort takeoffs or make unscheduled landings. Four happened after the FAA directive was issued in 2010.

Rudy Canto, director of flight operations-technical for Airbus Americas, said that temporary electrical failures in all makes of jets aren't uncommon and that all planes have backup systems - as well as backups to the backups - to handle those situations. New Airbus models are equipped with an automatic power switchover to counteract failures like the one at Newark, Canto said.

But Patrick Smith, a commercial pilot since 1990 who has written extensively on aviation safety for http://www.askthepilot.com , said he has never experienced anything remotely similar to the multiple failures described by Cochran and others.

""I can't even recall a case of losing more than a single non-critical instrument, so the idea of all critical flight displays going out at once is pretty radical,"" Smith said.

Also, electrical failures that cause communication blackouts are more dangerous nowadays, given the post-Sept. 11 fear of terrorists seizing the cockpit.

It isn't known how many of the 633 A320-series jets operated by U.S. carriers are flying without the required modification because airlines do not have to notify the FAA about each. But United said earlier this year that it has completed work on more than half its fleet of 152 Airbuses covered by the FAA's directive, while USAirways said it has modified more than 60 percent of its 189 affected Airbuses. Delta didn't respond to requests for information about its Airbus fleet.

About 2,400 of the planes in service with non-U.S. carriers are required to make the modification, according to Airbus. A spokesman for the European Aviation Safety Agency said the organization doesn't have figures on the number of planes fixed.

A pilot who recounted a 2009 incident on NASA's Aviation Safety Reporting System said that 28 years and 20,000 hours of flying experience couldn't help him explain why the cockpit was ""like walking into a simulator with no power or batteries on ... only light was the moon."" The website does not identify the airlines or airports involved.

On the Newark flight, Cochran told investigators, nearly all cockpit indicators and gauges were lost, including his standby attitude indicator, a display that enables pilots to keep a plane at the correct angle. His primary attitude indicator also failed, but re-emerged shortly before landing.

""If they'd had bad weather, they could have lost the airplane, absolutely,"" said Moss, who has conducted accident investigations and served as an expert witness in aviation cases. ""It was just dumb luck that it was daytime and the visibility was good.""

In the Newark tower, a chilling thought occurred to controllers as Flight 731 circled back without warning: Was this another 9/11 about to unfold?

""You could see him making a hard right and then another turn; he's deviating off his course and loaded with fuel,"" a controller working that day recalled. The controller spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because of rules against talking to the media. ""He turned back east and was going right toward New York, and I thought, `Oh, here we go again.'""

A 2006 failure described by Britain's Air Accidents Investigation Branch was similarly alarming. Ninety minutes into an EasyJet flight from Spain to England, electronic instrument displays and radio communications went dead. As the pilots struggled to fix the problem, the Airbus stopped sending radar signals for 10 minutes.

With ""no means of knowing where the aircraft was or what had happened to it,"" French air traffic controllers diverted another plane that would have passed through the same airspace less than 20 seconds apart, according to the British report.

The plane landed safely in England with the pilots trying unsuccessfully to reach the control tower with cellphones. They told investigators they worried they would be intercepted by military aircraft if they tried to land at another airport.

Bill Bozin, Airbus Americas vice president for safety, said the company took steps to address the problem before the Newark emergency, issuing two service bulletins in 2007 recommending electrical system modifications. Unlike a regulatory agency, an airplane manufacturer can't require airlines to make safety upgrades.

Bozin said increased awareness of the problem has improved the situation ""immensely"" even though many planes are still flying without the required modification - an automatic power switchover.

""With both Airbus, through its communication with its customers, and FAA, which has put out safety bulletins on this issue, we feel that the procedures have been sufficiently emphasized that we are safe right now even before we get the ultimate solution, which is the automatic switchover,"" he said.

While the NTSB has called the electrical failures ""a significant safety risk"" on takeoffs and landings in low visibility, long gaps between when a safety recommendation is issued and when airlines must carry it out are not uncommon, an investigator in the Flight 731 probe said.

""I would love for it to be done immediately as a safety protocol, but that can't happen,"" said Scott Warren, team leader of an NTSB group that investigates electrical and hydraulic failures. ""That puts a huge burden on the operators to ground the planes every time a safety recommendation is made. So you have to evaluate whether it makes sense to wait a month, two months, four months, or more.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.722361147403717}",neutral,0.722361147403717,0

Philippine Airlines (PAL) announced Tuesday it had ordered 54 Airbus aircraft with a list price of $7 billion, and planned to buy dozens more planes in a spectacular move to rejuvenate Asia's oldest carrier.



The initial orders would more than double PAL's current fleet of 39 planes, and allow it to serve more long-haul international routes while meeting the challenges of intense low-cost competition at home.



""The orders we are placing with Airbus will play a key role in revitalizing PAL and growing trade and tourism in the country,"" PAL Chairman Lucio Tan and President Ramon Ang said in a joint statement.



In a separate statement Airbus said the ""firm orders"" were for 44 single-aisle A321 planes and 10 long-haul A330-300s. Delivery would start next year with the final planes of the batch ready to start flying in 2015.



PAL said the orders had a list price of $7 billion. But airlines typically negotiate big discounts on such deals and PAL officials refused to say exactly how much the airline would pay.



Ang told reporters PAL was looking to buy 100 new planes in total, and that discussions were under way with Boeing as well as Airbus to secure the extra aircraft.



""Our intention is to buy up to 100 aircraft, 26 of that will be long range, wide body,"" Ang said.



The PAL announcement comes after San Miguel, one of the Philippines' biggest conglomerates, bought a 49 percent stake in the loss-making carrier for $500 million in April, and took over management.



Ang is president of San Miguel while billionaire Tan, an ethnic Chinese tycoon who is the country's second wealthiest man, remains PAL's controlling shareholder.



Ang said raising the money to finance the fleet expansion would not be a problem, with PAL to initially use the $500 million injection from San Miguel, and loans potentially also to be taken out.



He said San Miguel, famous for its beer but which has embarked on an aggressive and successful diversification programme over the past decade, was prepared to put more money into PAL if needed, as was Tan.



Ang also emphasized that the carrier had returned to profit following some major restructuring that included the outsourcing of 2,600 jobs, although he said balance sheet specifics would not be released for a couple of months.



PAL, which began flying in 1941, reported a net loss of $33.5 million in the three months to December, reversing a profit of $15.1 million from the same period the previous year.



However the airline's reputation had also declined, with passengers complaining of old planes, limited flight options and poor service.



PAL also lost its status as the nation's top carrier, with low-cost airline Cebu Pacific establishing itself in recent years as the biggest in terms of ticket sales and number of routes.



With Tuesday's deal, PAL has set itself on a course to regain its status as the biggest player in the Philippine.

Up and down for Airbus and Boeing - The National,"Tue, 28 Aug 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW5hdGlvbmFsbmV3cy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvdXAtYW5kLWRvd24tZm9yLWFpcmJ1cy1hbmQtYm9laW5nLTEuNDY4NDgz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing and Airbus have had a deluge of orders cancelled as airlines are buffeted by the euro-zone crisis, a stalled recovery in the United States and a slowdown in China's economy.

But this has not been all bad news for the world's two biggest aircraft manufacturers - now they can catch up with a backlog of orders.

Still, the number of lost sales are mounting up. Last week, Qantas scrapped its order for 35 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, pushing the total number of cancellations so far for the next-generation aircraft to more than 200.

Airbus suffered a similar blow to its state-of-the-art project, the A350-1000, in May, when Etihad Airways confirmed it was ditching almost half of its initial order for 25 for the new twin-jet.

In Australia, Qantas cancelled its order for the 787-8 variant to reduce capital expenditure. But deliveries of 15 of that model to its low-cost subsidiary, Jetstar, will continue as planned. Qantas itself still aims to take delivery of 50 of the larger 787-9 variant as early as 2016 if needed.

The Australian carrier said the cancellations would help it to save US$8.5 billion (Dh31.22bn).

""Qantas continues to practise disciplined capital management and, in the context of returning Qantas International to profit, this is a prudent decision,"" said Alan Joyce, the chief executive. ""Qantas has always maintained flexibility in its fleet plan and made changes when required.""

In May, Etihad cut seven Airbus A350-1000s from its order book, having previously cancelled six, saying delivery delays had forced it to rethink its schedule for bringing new aircraft into the fleet.

""Although not intrinsically linked, the recent delay to the A350 programme provided an appropriate opportunity for Etihad to revisit its projected fleet mix in the latter part of the decade,"" a spokesman said.

""Etihad Airways has a great deal of confidence in the A350 programme and we retain attractive delivery positions.""

The decision to cancel seven planes represents a loss of $2.2bn for Airbus at the catalogue price. So you might think both blows would have plunged the world's two greatest airliner manufacturers into crisis.

Not at all.

""The cancellation is not seen as having any major repercussions for the 787 programme,"" reported Flight International, an aviation industry journal, last week.

Similar sentiments were expressed following Etihad's announcement.

The reason is because, when it comes to buying airliners, cancellations are not always permanent. And, for the plane makers, it also takes the pressure off packed order books. So one man's cancellation is another man's early delivery.

Boeing secured the 787 order from Qantas back in December 2005 in the teeth of competition from Airbus and its A350.

The Australian airline was originally due to receive its first 787 in July 2009 but that was pushed back by successive delays.

Eddy Pieniazek, the director of consultancy at the aviation analyst Ascend, pointed out the hold-up in deliveries would have helped Qantas to wriggle out of the contract.

""Because of the delays, Qantas probably hasn't been as far into the pre-delivery payment schedule as it could have been,"" he said. ""The delays may have allowed Qantas the option to cancel and recover pre-delivery payments and compensation without too much of a penalty.

""Although the Qantas cancellation is a big number, it's not happened because the aircraft isn't performing, so we don't see any major repercussions. Boeing has more than 800 deliveries to work through and we could even see Qantas coming back for more later in the programme. Qantas still have 50 options, they will be back.""

Since 2009, customers have cancelled some 216 Dreamliners, citing a variety of reasons.

Just as Boeing has had teething problems bringing the 787 to service on time, Airbus has had numerous hiccups on its A350 programme.

Hans Peter Ring, the chief financial officer of Airbus' parent company EADS, has attributed the initial three to six-month delay in the A350-900s delivery to a ""shortage of parts"". This has been caused by a supplier funding issue - a result of the euro-zone debt crisis.

The new aircraft was then put through a re-design, much to the consternation of customers such as Qatar Airways and Emirates Airline.

""This programme will likely be a challenge for several years,"" said Bernstein Research in New York.""Feedback we have received from customers is that the A350 is considerably overweight at this stage.

""The programme has also become more complex with the need to develop a second engine core to provide sufficient thrust for the A350-1000. Some customers, particularly in the Middle East, have complained that the current design of the A350-1000 is not large enough.""

Bernstein does not expect the first A350-900 to be delivered until 2015. There have been a total of 41 cancellations for the A350, leaving the total order book at 555 aircraft.

That does not mean orders for the A350 programme have dried up. Airbus received 10 last year and this month, Cathay Pacific said it would convert 16 A350-900s on order into the larger variant 1000s and buy an additional 10 with delivery between 2018 and 2020.

""[The primary issue is] getting them early delivery positions,"" said John Leahy, the chief operating officer for customers at Airbus.

Since Houston is a major center for the oil industry and one of the most international cities, they expect the Airbus A380 to be a great addition for Houston and promote economic growth.

“This is also about jobs and economic development for Houston. The jobs to complete the improvements at the airport and the jobs to service these planes as well as the jobs enhanced by the ability to connect Houston to other parts of the world will enhance our economic development as a city. One of the reasons I believe Lufthansa chose to bring the A380 to Houston and establish this much larger footprint is because of the strong economic ties between Houston and Germany,” Parker said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999792575836182}",neutral,0.9999792575836182,0

UTair Aviation (UTair) in Tyumen, Russia, is choosing the CFM International CFM56-5B engine for the airline's 20 Airbus A321 single-aisle passenger jetliners ordered last month at the Farnborough International Airshow in Farnborough, England.

The engine order for the UTair commercial aviation aircraft is worth $420 million, and deliveries are to begin in 2013. CFM is a partnership of Snecma in Courcouronnes, France, and GE Aerospace in Evendale, Ohio. All of UTAir’s A321 aircraft will be powered by the CFM56-5B Performance Improvement Package (PIP) engine.

The CFM56-5B PIP engine maintains the same noise signature as the previous production model and also meets current International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Committee of Aviation Environmental Protection standards (CAEP /6) requirements.

The engine has a new high-pressure turbine blade, and changes to the fan and compressor blades and vanes. The engine also features fewer parts to help lower maintenance cost, Snecma officials say.

To support its A321 fleet, UTair also signed a long-term rate per flight hour (RPFH) agreement for 40 CFM56-5B engines, which provides a multi-year maintenance program. CFM guarantees the maintenance cost on a dollar-per-engine flight hour basis.

UTair has been a CFM customer since 2007 and operates a fleet of CFM56-powered Boeing Next-Generation 737 aircraft. The new A321s, which will be configured for 220 passengers, will fly on domestic and international tourist routes.

UTair is among the top three Russian airlines, and will fly about 10 million passengers this year, UTair officials say. UTAIR operates more than 200 commercial aircraft from its hub at Vnukovo International Airport in Moscow, from which it operates 100 flights daily.

Advertisement

For the last few decades, we have been told wind power is going to be massive.

Now the manufacturing giant Siemens is taking this literally, by building the world's largest turbines - with each blade measuring an astonishing 75 metres in length.

That means each of them is only a fraction shorter than the largest passenger plane ever built - the A380 Airbus, with a wingspan measuring 79.8 metres across.



Each of these blades is single piece of carbon fibre, and the turbines will eventually be mounted off the coast of Britain from 2014.



Giant turbine: The Siemans blade is the world's largest fiberglass component cast in one piece

Siemens is working with partner DONG Energy to create the offshore turbines.

The pair agreed on July 19, 2012 to supply a total of 300 wind turbines with a capacity of 1,800 megawatts, which will be installed in wind power plants off the coast of Britain between 2014 and 2017.

DONG Energy has already announced that it will install two of the new 6MW wind turbines later this year for testing at Gunfleet Sands offshore wind farm, which is about five miles off the Essex coast near the Thames estuary.

The 6MW wind turbines are designed for large-scale projects, with the government targeting to produce 18 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2020, which will equate to around 18 percent of the UK's electricity demand.

Scaling the heights of wind technology: An A380's wingspan is only a fraction bigger than one blade

A special vehicle, traveling 60 kilometers per hour, transported these giants over a distance of 575 kilometers from the blade factory in Aalborg, Denmark, to the Danish town of Nakskov on Lolland Island

The rotor has a diameter of 154 meters and has a swept area of more than 18,600 square meters, which is equivalent to the area of approximately two-and-a-half football fields. Siemens says the energy production of one 6MW turbine is sufficient to supply about 6,000 European households with electricity.

Each blade is constructed from two pieces of fibre carbon - making these the largest individual pieces of fibre carbon constructions in the world.

In 1991, the two companies built the world's first offshore wind power plant Vindeby in Denmark. This has been followed by a total of 13 projects with 930 wind turbines.

The blades are built in a factory in Aalborg, Denmark.

Once constructed, a special lorry, traveling at 60 kilometers per hour, transports these giants over a distance of 575 kilometers from the factory the Danish town of Nakskov on Lolland Island.

By car, the trip is about 330 km, but because of the length of the rotor blade, some re-routing is necessary, taking bridges and tunnels into consideration.

In Nakskov the blades were painted – although some adaptions are needed as the painting cabin is currently limited to a 58m blade length.



Michael Suess, a boardmember for Siemens energy sector, said: 'Offshore wind energy has huge potential. Offshore wind conditions are strong and stable, enabling an energy yield which can be about 40 percent higher than onshore.

'The United Kingdom, Denmark and Germany in particular are counting on the future of offshore wind energy. We are pleased that our long-term customer DONG Energy has chosen the latest generation of our wind turbines.

'Together we are working to further reduce the levelised costs for this environmentally-friendly form of power generation.'

These turbines will be installed in wind power plants off the British coast between 2014 and 2017

Singapore Airlines revamps cabins as rivals catch up - LUXUO,"Fri, 17 Aug 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmx1eHVvLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvdHJhdmVsL3NpbmdhcG9yZS1haXJsaW5lcy1yZXZhbXBzLWNhYmlucy5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Lifestyle / Travel

Singapore Airlines is bringing in BMW and DesignworksUSA to help develop its next generation of in-flight cabin products.

Aug 17, 2012 | By AFPRelaxnews

Singapore Airlines has said it plans to introduce revamped seats and cabin interiors with an upgraded in-flight entertainment in a bid to stay ahead of Asian and Middle East rivals in the premium travel market.



SIA is regarded as a trendsetter in aviation and is famous for its cabin service, but rivals like Cathay Pacific in Asia and Etihad, Emirates and Gulf Air from the Middle East have been closing the gap while offering lower fares.

It said Tuesday it has hired BMW Group subsidiary DesignworksUSA and James Park Associates, two renowned design companies, to develop “next generation of inflight cabin products” slated to be introduced next year.

The changes will include revamped seats, redesigned cabins and upgraded entertainment platforms as new planes from Boeing and Airbus begin arriving.

Emphasis will be on first and business class which generate the bulk of its revenue but the airline said it will not overlook its economy class which will offer improved seat and headrest comfort.

New Boeing 777-300 ERs are expected to enter service in the second half of next year, followed progressively by Airbus A350s and Boeing 787s, the airline said.

But the airline said its current fleet, which includes Airbus A380 superjumbos, can also be retrofitted with the new designs.

“In this business, if you are staying still, you are moving backwards as your competitors can catch up quickly ,” said Tan Pee Teck, SIA’s senior VP for products and services. “It is therefore important to always be planning for the future.”

Analysts say the airline is being squeezed in the first and business class section by full-service carriers and in the economy class by low cost airlines.

“Relatively speaking, Singapore Airlines is losing its competitive edge in premium Asia travel not because it’s a bad airline, but because the others — like Emirates — are becoming so good,” said Jonathan Galaviz, managing director of Galaviz & Co which follows the global airline and tourism sector.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999782145023346}",neutral,0.999782145023346,0

The attacking midfielder leaves after making more than 150 appearances.

He has agreed non-contract terms with the Welsh Premier League outfit, meaning the Wingmakers do not need to negotiate compensation with Riley’s now former club.

The Guardian understands that at least one other manager made the Macclesfield-based midfielder an offer, but Riley’s wish to link up again with Preece helped to make up his mind.

That, plus the familiarity of playing with Kyle Armstrong, Chris Budrys, Tom Field, Jordan Johnson, Ian Kearney, Michael Roddy and Ryan Wade, all of whom have swapped Wincham for Wales.

The A350 will be the first Airbus with both fuselage and wing structures made primarily of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer. It will carry 250 to 350 passengers in three-class seating, depending on variant. The A350 was born as an A330-derived minimum-changed competitor to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the larger Boeing 777, but was unanimously rejected by prospective customers. Airbus was forced to redesign the initial proposal, but airlines voiced support for a complete overhaul. The eventual proposal incorporates major changes, which Airbus says will be more fuel-efficient, with up to 8% lower operating cost than the Boeing 787. The redesigned A350 was marketed by Airbus as the A350 XWB, where the XWB stands for Extra Wide Body. The launch customer for the A350 is Qatar Airways, which ordered 80 aircraft across the three variants. Development costs are projected to be US$15 billion. The airliner is scheduled to enter airline service during the second half of 2014. As of 20 January 2012, 561 orders had been placed for the new aircraft.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9992973804473877}",neutral,0.9992973804473877,0
