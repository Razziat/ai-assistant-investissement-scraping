SAPIENT: A DISRUPTIVE APPROACH TO AIR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT - Thales,"Fri, 21 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbmV3cy9zYXBpZW50LWRpc3J1cHRpdmUtYXBwcm9hY2gtYWlyLXRyYWZmaWMtbWFuYWdlbWVudNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The SAPIENT project (Satellite and terrestrial architectures improving performance, security and safety in ATM) entails innovative solutions for air traffic management/communications, navigation, surveillance (ATM/CNS), focusing on improvements to air-ground datalinks via the introduction of 4D TBO (Trajectory Based Operation). It will harmonize global trajectory information sharing, to build a single, integrated view of all flight paths that can be shared by all stakeholders, resulting in significant operational benefits for flight management. Higher-performance digital datalinks, both satellite and terrestrial, are essential factors in this changeover, a pillar of the SESAR (Single European Sky ATM Research) road map. The SAPIENT solution is also designed to incorporate future European Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) flying in non-segregated airspace.

Boosting global ATM efficiency, capacity and performance





The most innovative aspect of SAPIENT is the integration of estimated 4D trajectories with the data generated by distributed and dynamic monitoring, along with reporting on the performance of air/ground datalinks for “Safety of Life” ATM communications. The sharing of onboard 4D trajectory data by ground ATC systems, plus the datalink performance estimates during flight, will result in:

More efficient ATM services, ultimately meeting SESAR requirements.

Improved predictability of air/ground datalink performance during flights, to support the above.

Significant reduction in the need for “emergency and not routine” voice communications, to achieve above goals with no safety penalty.

Integration of civilian RPAS C2 datalinks in the Single European Sky, in line with SESAR ATM Master Plan objectives.

Project partners

The project partners are: Thales Alenia Space (in Italy) as principal coordinator, Bip (Business Integration Partner), Frequentis, SITA, University of Pisa and ViaSat. As coordinator of the SAPIENT Consortium, Thales Alenia Space is in charge of the overall study, and acts as the technical and managerial interface with the customer, the SESAR Joint Undertaking. Thales Alenia Space has overall technical responsibility in the SAPIENT study for the solution definition, its architecture, protocol definition and assessment of results and benefits.

Thales and University of the West of Scotland build AI thermal imaging system - Imaging and Machine Vision Europe,"Mon, 17 Jul 2017 11:59:36 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmltdmV1cm9wZS5jb20vbmV3cy90aGFsZXMtYW5kLXVuaXZlcnNpdHktd2VzdC1zY290bGFuZC1idWlsZC1haS10aGVybWFsLWltYWdpbmctc3lzdGVt0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A new approach to thermal imaging incorporating machine learning has been developed that improves the classification of objects at distances up to 1,500 metres.

The technology is the result of a collaborative project involving CENSIS, the Scottish innovation centre for sensor and imaging systems; Thales in Glasgow; and University of the West of Scotland (UWS).

Still in its development stages, the system can already detect and classify humans and six different types of vehicles.

Dr Pablo Casaseca, senior lecturer in signal and image processing at UWS, said: ‘The system we’ve created is a unique piece of technology – it significantly enhances detection and classification capabilities on thermal imaging cameras at a long range. The potential applications for the technology could be widespread, and if we present the system with enough high quality data, it could detect a whole host of objects with a very small number of pixels. The more training data presented to the machine over time, the better the system responds – even to objects or compositions it hasn’t encountered before.’

The system is trained to identify a range of different visual signatures, classifying them based on common characteristics. The training process involves presenting the machine with hundreds of images of a subject to analyse at a variety of angles, distances, and with different obstructions. Over time, this allows it to build up an understanding of how particular people, vehicles, or items should appear.

The technology could have applications in a variety of industries, with the security, surveillance, engineering and construction sectors among those that could benefit most.

‘In security and surveillance fields, for example, the system could help staff monitor video feeds or footage,’ Casaseca continued. ‘Observing security cameras over long periods of time can lower concentration levels. Our system could assist by pointing out objects of interest in the distance and suggest what they might be before they approach. In construction or infrastructure, if a camera embedded with the technology was placed on a UAV or drone, it could identify small cracks on larger structures, such as a bridge, by detecting the defect and focusing on it.’

CENSIS brokered the relationship between UWS and Thales. The innovation centre, which recently announced its 50th project, aims to bring together Scotland’s academic institutions and industrial base.

Dr Matt Kitchin, algorithms engineer at Thales in Glasgow, said: ‘By pairing UWS’ object detection technology and machine learning techniques with our imaging expertise, we have developed a new capability in object detection and identification, which we would hope to be able to deploy on products in the future.

‘The outcome of phase one has been encouraging – the classification results have yielded very high success rates over a wide range of imagery,’ he continued. ‘Due to the findings, and the potential opportunities the project has unveiled for both Thales and UWS, we’ve launched a second research and development phase. We’ve also appointed two algorithm engineers in Glasgow to work on the implementation of these machine learning algorithms, and to help us fine-tune and better understand how we can apply the technology for use in a range of industries.’","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9289394021034241}",neutral,0.9289394021034241,0
Thales Happy Times May Last - The Corner Economic,"Mon, 17 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29ybmVyLmV1L25ld3MtZXVyb3BlL3RoYWxlcy1oYXBweS10aW1lcy1tYXktbGFzdC82NTkxNi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After the military welcome that Macron offered Trump last week on the Champs Elysees, it seems appropiate to examine closely French new government resolutions in terms of military spending, and more specifically their plans for one of France defense crown jewel Thales. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has confirmed that the defense budget would see cuts of about $968 million in 2017. However, he has also committed to a further military spending plan for 2018 which will eventually bring defence spending to the 2% threshold required by NATO by 2025 against a current 1.77% ($55.7bn spent in 2016). In this sense, Carax- Alphavalue starts by wondering if the 26% stake in Thales owned by the French state is on the block.

“Yes, if one considers the intention of the new government to fund investments in new industries; No, as Thales is strategic to both Dassault (a client and a 25% shareholder) and the French government. We argued before that a golden share could make the trick of retaining a strategic say but there has been pretty little noise in government circles about such a move.”

The good news though is that the situation at the head of the company seems to have stabilised since the arrival of Patrice Caine as CEO in 2014, despite job cuts and continuous reorganisations. Whatever the speculative background, Thales surfs on a defence upcycle that justifies sticking to the share with a 20% upside.

Stronger military spending

The defense budget uprise that Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced by 2018 represents an incremental spending of about $40bn over the period. This should benefit Airbus and its A400M, but also Safran and its military engines. As the main supplier of the Dassault Rafale jet (25% of components from Thales) and other key defence products, Thales benefits most. It supplied the French armies in 2016 with gear worth €1.5bn. In addition, through its 35% share of Naval Group (the new marketing moniker of DCNS), it participates in the €1.4bn worth of equipment that the Naval Group provides.

Four pillar strategy

Being the specialist of “gathering, processing and delivering clear information in a requiring environment”, as said by Carax- Alphavalue, Thales structures its strategy around four key pillars: Connectivity, Big data, Artificial intelligence and Cyber-security. Experts explain:

No big surprise there but a confirmation that Thales is ever more focused on the soft side of military products. Most of its R&D efforts are focused on these pillars as are recent acquisitions. Unsurprisingly as well, such technologies, could be deployed in both civil and military markets. Drones, air traffic monitoring and secured communication networks are essential in preventing inland civil threats. While radar, combat systems and optronics are essential military know-how that benefit from increasing defence spending by emerging countries. For mature countries, here defence spending is likely to rise to the 2% of GDP target set by NATO anyway.

On its way to becoming a cash machine?

The current management has been behind a strong operational performance since 2015 with a very satisfactory operating cash flow conversion, at last now standing above adjusted net profit. This has enabled Thales to increase its payout ratio since 2014 to a quite high 38% in 2016 without impeding its acquisition strategy, an essential feature of Thales’ good showing. The only activity that still stands out like a sore thumb compared to other well-oiled ones is the Transport one, which remains impacted by negative margin contracts.

With the prop of premia added to peer multiples (to account for the strong impact of Rafale fighter sales on mid- and near-term profits), Thales remains one of analysts sector favourites with a significant 19% upside.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7037534713745117}",neutral,0.7037534713745117,0

In a memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed this morning, the University of Sydney and Thales Australia have committed to work closely together over the next five years to develop new technologies and capabilities. The MOU was signed by the University of Sydney Vice-Chancellor and Principal Dr Michael Spence and Thales Australia Country Director and CEO Chris Jenkins.

Mr Jenkins said, “This is a significant milestone in the company’s history as we move to an enhanced relationship with the University of Sydney.”

“Thales Australia’s long-term relationship with the University has contributed to breakthrough technology in underwater sensing and Thales’s sovereign capability in fibre laser sensors.

“Recognising the pace of innovation, especially in digital technologies like big data, machine learning and artificial intelligence, it is critical for Thales to partner with leading universities.

“The future applications of these technologies will require a holistic and integrated response, moving beyond individual disciplines and creating the next generation of careers and technological and industrial capabilities.”

Dr Spence said the signing was a significant milestone that would see the University of Sydney’s researchers offered new opportunities to collaborate on transformational industry projects and Thales to obtain access to world-class research.

“We have made great gains in increasing our engagement with industry in 2017, which is a major priority in our 2016-20 Strategic Plan. Thales has a long and established track record of successful collaboration with a number of academic institutions around the world and we are proud to partner with them formally,” Dr Spence said.

Under the terms of the MOU, the partners will initially work on research activities within the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technologies, in the areas of autonomous systems, artificial intelligence, data analytics, advanced sensing and processing, and materials science.

Dean of the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technologies Professor Archie Johnston said the MOU builds on a positive existing relationship between Thales and the faculty. This notably included a 2015 Australian Research Council Linkage Project between Thales and researchers from the University’s Australian Centre for Field Robotics, looking at new ways to increase the effectiveness of underwater survey operations.

“By collaborating, exchanging ideas and sharing best practice with Thales, our engineering and IT researchers will gain new ideas about how to translate their research into practical solutions for industry,” Professor Johnston said.

Over the longer term, the partners also intend to explore other research, education and training pursuits which may include events, industry development programs and student mentoring opportunities.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9975570440292358}",positive,0.9975570440292358,1
Ferra selected for submarine radar motors - Australian Defence Magazine,"Mon, 24 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5kZWZlbmNlLmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzL2ZlcnJhLXNlbGVjdGVkLWZvci1zdWJtYXJpbmUtcmFkYXItbW90b3Jz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Philip Smart | Adelaide

Brisbane-based Ferra Australia will build motors for Thales Phoenice tactical submarine navigation radar systems destined for a European customer, announcing a deal with Thales Germany last week after an 18-month Global Supply Chain selection process.

Ferra is initially contracted to provide two Primoss pressure-tight motors – self-contained systems around 1.1 metres high that are mounted outside a submarine’s pressure hull to drive the Phoenice radar antenna on the surface. The systems must be watertight at depth, and include a high-torque motor and complex control system to withstand wave slaps at different sea states without impairing the performance of the radar.

Ferra’s selection completes an 18-month process in which 10 SMEs in South Australia, Victoria and Queensland were initially issued technical drawings and invited to produce a test piece. After a visit from Thales Germany personnel, five companies were then shortlisted to submit Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) pricing, which was found to be comparable to that of existing German suppliers.

Thales released a full Request For Quote(RFQ) in August 2016, with Ferra selected in June 2017. The company’s supplier team includes Queensland’s EM Solutions for complex electronic systems, and Adelaide’s Axiom Precision Manufacturing.

Ferra managing director Mark Arthur said the contract underlined both the company’s journey to becoming a provider of complex systems and the capabilities of Australian industry.

“We have grown quite significantly and the complexity of the work that we do has also changed and moved up the value chain,” Arthur told ADM. “And I think our supply chain, the fact that we have some very competent companies here in Australia who have their own very high reputations, offered something to Thales that was quite unique.”

He believes the expertise in both Ferra and the supplier companies will overcome any issues in producing a complex system that is critical to the Phoenice radar’s performance.

“This system, once fully assembled, is extremely complex and will require a large amount of testing, which includes mechanical and electrical testing as an entire system,” Arthur said. “That will be at a higher and a more complex level than what we have done in the past. But I think we’ve got the skills and experience available to us here, or reaching out in to our supply chain, to overcome those problems.”

Thales Industry Engagement Manager for Australia - France/Europe, David Peckham, said the Ferra partnership would open opportunities for both the European defence company and Australian SMEs.

“By establishing a regional partner and supply chain in Australia, Thales Germany aims to globalise its business and open up new markets,” he said. “There will also be opportunities for Ferra and other Australian companies to be involved in the upcoming redesigns of some of the components of the Phoenice radar system which are planned by Thales Germany for the next years.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999278783798218}",neutral,0.9999278783798218,0

Thales and the DLR: Celebrating 30 years of enabling greater journeys in East London - Thales,"Mon, 31 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi91bml0ZWQta2luZ2RvbS9uZXdzL3RoYWxlcy1hbmQtZGxyLWNlbGVicmF0aW5nLTMwLXllYXJzLWVuYWJsaW5nLWdyZWF0ZXItam91cm5leXMtZWFzdC1sb25kb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales and the DLR: Celebrating 30 years of enabling greater journeys in East London Share this article



LinkedIn

This July marks thirty years since the opening of London’s Docklands Light Railway (DLR). As we celebrate the history of this railway to date, we look at the key involvement of Thales in making this success a reality and the example that the DLR sets for the rest of London’s transport network.

Launched in 1987, the DLR was created to connect London’s Docklands area to the rest of the city. Initially covering eight miles of ground, with fifteen stations, the line connected to Stratford, Tower Gateway and Island Gardens. Although its initial capacity was less than it is today, the automated service greatly increased passenger traffic to the Docklands, with only a single member of staff required on each train for any assistance and emergencies. The DLR received considerable investment as it expanded over the years to reach additional locations such as Bank, Lewisham and Woolwich Arsenal. The line now visits 45 stations, has tripled in length to cover 24 miles of track and carries an annual total of 122 million passengers.

The DLR is an example of an autonomous railway delivering benefits not only to passengers, but to operators and London as a whole. Reliable and secure, passengers consistently have positive journey experiences as they visit places, such as the ExCeL centre, that were inaccessible or non-existent beforehand. Through increasing capacity and reducing costs, operators benefit by having a more effective service that transports greater numbers of passengers. Additionally, and arguably the greatest benefit to autonomous railways, the technology greatly complements the priorities of London over the coming years.

Sadiq Khan, Mayor of London, states in his manifesto that he aims to ‘make travel greener’ and, with his commitment to reducing London’s CO 2 emissions by 60% by 2025, his plans to achieve this reinforce his statement. With Sadiq Khan prioritising the environment, transport and housing for the rapidly growing population, a more capable and cost-effective railway infrastructure will be vital to London. Through developing London’s infrastructure and by encouraging the use of a modernised public transport system, autonomous trains will continue to have crucial advantages as London advances towards becoming a ‘low-carbon beacon’.

Thales’s technology has formed a key part of the DLR’s history and has been in service on the line since 1994. Known as the SelTrac signalling system, the service uses communications-based train control (CBTC) to operate trains without the need for a driver. In addition to the installation of this service, 2007 saw Thales teams in the UK and Canada upgrade the system’s technology to enable a three, rather than two, car service on the DLR. These upgrades resulted in a 50 per cent capacity increase, a significant improvement for the railway line.

In addition to installing its SelTrac signalling system, Thales has also made significant upgrades to the vehicle control centre (VCC) at Beckton. Installing third generation VCC technology in Beckton in 2011, Thales’s work on the DLR helped greatly towards the success of the London Olympics and was also the first operational 3GVCC installed in the world. Carrying double the amount of passengers than usual, the DLR was able to effectively handle an enormous surge in traffic as passengers travelled to the global sporting event. SelTrac CBTC performed successfully during the event, supporting a record-breaking number of passengers. Additionally, following Thales’s upgrades to the signalling technology, the Jubilee line performed exceptionally well during the Olympics, being described as ‘the star of the show’.

With Beckton’s upgrade to third generation technology proving successful, 2014 saw plans established to make similar changes at Poplar control centre. Updating technology that had previously been used for twenty-five years, the upgrade was a significant advancement that has contributed to the further success of the DLR. In combination with the SelTrac CBTC system, these developments have provided safe, reliable, short headway between trains to enable greater capacity on the line, whilst greatly reducing operating and maintenance costs.

Since their involvement in the DLR, Thales has been co-located in the same buildings as the DLR team. This has provided the opportunity to work very closely over the years and is part of the experience that forms their expertise in London railways. Thales is a trusted partner for developing the future of London transport.

"June 28 rush-hour delay on NSL, Tuas West Extension due to 'human error' - TODAY","Fri, 14 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvZGF5b25saW5lLmNvbS9zaW5nYXBvcmUvanVuZS0yOC1ydXNoLWhvdXItZGVsYXktbnNsLXR1YXMtd2VzdC1leHRlbnNpb24tZHVlLWh1bWFuLWVycm9y0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SINGAPORE — The train delays during rush hour along the North-South Line (NSL) and the Tuas West Extension on June 28 was due to human error, and not due to the new signalling system, said SMRT and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) on Friday (July 14).

While installing some software, a team from Thales, the company supplying the signalling systems, missed a step. This led to all trains on both lines losing communications, in what was the single biggest train disruption in 14 months.

In a joint media briefing, Mr Tan Yih Long, the LTA’s re-signalling project director, said the mistake was made while a Thales team was configuring and loading some new radio software as part of implementing the new signalling system in East-West Line (EWL) stations.

SMRT Trains’ chief executive Lee Ling Wee added: “While doing all that, they missed a step and caused a situation where you have two different kinds of software coexisting (that are) incompatible ... therefore sending out a lot of noise signals that caused the trains (to be unable) to talk to the system.""

“There were certain steps that the Thales engineers had to follow; they did not follow the exact protocol.”

As a result, trains on both lines lost communications, a safety feature was triggered, and all trains came to a halt.

This led to train delays of more than two hours during the evening rush hour on June 28.

Thales Singapore country director and CEO, Mr Kevin Chow, who was also present at the briefing, told reporters that it was an incident caused by a “deployment action”.

“We have learnt from the incident, and taken operational and technical steps to prevent this from happening again,” he added.

This included process improvements, such as tight coordination with SMRT and the LTA to ensure that for certain tasks, the Thales team only carries them out when fully authorised by the train operator and the authority.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9790620803833008}",negative,0.9790620803833008,-1

MPT, a consortium of Laing O’Rourke, VolkerRail and Thales, will design and construct the £350m extension to the Intu Trafford Centre via Trafford Park.

WSP is TfGM’s delivery partner.

The new 5.5km Trafford Park line will increase the size of the Metrolink network to more than 103km (64 miles), served by 99 stops. It will branch off from the existing Pomona stop and call at six new tram stops, ending at the city’s biggest shopping centre.

This is the first major project to benefit from the GM Devolution Deal, signed by Greater Manchester leaders and central government, in November 2014.

The contract was procured as a variation to the one that has already seen MPT deliver extensions to MediaCityUK, Ashton, East Didsbury, Oldham and Rochdale, Manchester Airport and the Second City Crossing.

Chair of the TfGM committee, Cllr Andrew Fender, said: “It makes absolute sense to continue the award-winning partnership with MPT and WSP to deliver the next exciting chapter in the Metrolink story. The phase three expansion programme has without doubt been one of largest and most ambitious transport projects to be delivered in the UK and is unprecedented in the light rail industry in terms of the size and scale of growth. I’m pleased that all formalities are now complete - it’s an existing and successful partnership and I know we are in great hands with Metrolink’s latest exciting expansion.”

MPT director Bryan Glass said: “The Laing O’Rourke, VolkerRail and Thales MPT consortium has successfully delivered three main contract extensions for Manchester Metrolink. We are therefore delighted to continue as a trusted partner to TfGM delivering the latest phase of the Metrolink’s growth taking the line through Trafford Park to the Trafford Centre.”

Ian Beaumont, programme director at WSP in Manchester, said: “We’ve built a strong relationship working with TfGM and MPT to deliver the vision of an integrated transport system across the city and we look forward to continuing this partnership. Our in-depth knowledge of the city and range of technical and programme management expertise makes us best-placed to oversee the next phase of this major infrastructure expansion to the Metrolink system, improving connectivity across Greater Manchester for the tens of millions of commuters and visitors who use the network every year.”

Advanced utility works are now under way along the line of the route, which will run concurrently with other enabling works. Up to 40 ducts and pipes will be relayed for electricity, water, gas, and telecommunications by one single contractor within each joint utility trench. When combined, the trench work totals 3.2km.

Work on the new Metrolink line is due to be completed by the end of 2020.

7 Benefits of Autonomous Cars (Quick Overview) - Thales,"Fri, 21 Jul 2017 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9tYXJrZXRzL2RpZ2l0YWwtaWRlbnRpdHktYW5kLXNlY3VyaXR5L2lvdC9tYWdhemluZS83LWJlbmVmaXRzLWF1dG9ub21vdXMtY2Fyc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Estimated reading time: 5 minutes

Last updated: January 2021

The first autonomous car can be dated back to the 1980s, in a project funded by the United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

Called the NavLab; it looked like a postal delivery truck. It bore little similarity to Google's driverless car (without a safety driver), first demonstrated on Arizona's roads in 2017.

Since then, technology has continued to evolve and sparked predictions about how autonomous cars will transform our lives and work.

Here are some of the more intriguing predictions.

#1. 90% reduction in traffic deaths

Yes, you read that right.

The United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) predicts that the rise of driverless cars will decrease traffic deaths drastically.

This prediction makes sense when you think about it.

In 2017, it reported 37,133 deaths due to vehicle crashes (94% of which were down to human error).

So, a 90% reduction would save 30,000 lives in a year.

#2. 60% drop in harmful emissions

Fewer accidents mean less traffic congestion, which means a drop in emissions.

But this is not just due to a reduction in accidents.

Ohio University's Future of Driving report states that harmful emissions will be reduced by 60% after the advent of autonomous vehicles.

Another key benefit of autonomous cars is their potential to revolutionize traffic flow dynamics.

#3. Eliminate stop-and-go waves by 100%

According to research at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, autonomous cars could eliminate the waves of traffic created by stop-and-go behaviour (where humans, rather than road accidents, develop speed changes).

This, in turn, will not only save people time but also decrease the time their cars are on the roads and reduce emissions.

#4. 10% improvement in fuel economy

Rand's Autonomous Vehicle Technology guide states that self-driving cars will provide a reduction in fuel economy by between 4% and 10%.

This is supported by the Ohio University study, which puts a figure of 3.1 billion gallons of fuel as the amount US drivers waste each year.

With improved fuel economy, there's an even broader impact to consider – a dramatic increase in the efficiency of our roadways.

#5. 500% increase in lane capacity

The same Rand report also predicts that lane capacity could increase by 500%.

The State Smart Transportation Initiative only puts this figure at 100% (still an impressive increase), which it says, in turn, could result in a 20% increase in traffic speeds.

#6. 40% reduction in travel time

UK citizens' travel time could be reduced by 40%, according to KPMG's Connected and Autonomous Vehicles – The UK Economic Opportunity.

The result?

A saving of £20bn in increased productivity and better use of time for people who would otherwise have been travelling in vehicles.

Meanwhile, in the US, autonomous cars are expected to save workers 80 billion hours lost to commuting, which will keep the economy at US$1.3tn.

Stay with us to discover the last point!

Alongside the time saved, the benefits of autonomous cars extend to substantial financial implications for consumers, including lowered insurance costs and overall savings in vehicle operation.

#7. Consumer savings of £5bn

In the UK, according to KPMG, the savings on reduced insurance costs, running costs, and parking mean the UK consumer market would save £5bn a year.

And there's more.

Autonomous cars are also expected to solve the 'last mile problem' (whereby people struggle to travel the final mile between their home and the public transport drop-off point).

It should supplement public transport, utilizing the reduction in traffic and the autonomous car's ability to find a parking space and park all by itself.

Moreover, there is a predicted drop in taxi wait time of 88% when autonomous taxis are used, 15% less space needed for parking and enhanced mobility for seniors in an ageing population.
