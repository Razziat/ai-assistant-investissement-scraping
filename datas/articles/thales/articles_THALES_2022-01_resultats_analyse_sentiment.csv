Axiom Space picks Thales Alenia to build commercial space station modules - Space.com,"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwYWNlLmNvbS9heGlvbS1zcGFjZS1jb21tZXJjaWFsLXN0YXRpb24tbW9kdWxlcy10aGFsZXMtYWxlbmlhLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An artist's depiction of the Axiom module after its detachment from the International Space Station.

Axiom Space, a company that aims to launch a private space station, has selected a builder for two critical modules for the commercial orbital platform.

The new commercial agreement marks a step forward in Axiom Space's quest to add a new module to the International Space Station (ISS) — one that will become an independent station of its own once the ISS is deorbited.

In January, NASA agreed to allow Axiom Space, a Houston-based company, to construct a new space station module that would launch in 2024 and increase the amount of habitable space astronauts have to work with on the ISS. When the space station retires, the Axiom Space component will detach and take on a life of its own as an independent commercial outpost. Now, Axiom has hired Thales Alenia Space , a European space company, to design and build two crucial components of that module.

""The legacy of the International Space Station structure is one of safety and reliability despite huge technical complexity,"" Axiom Space CEO Michael Suffredini, who spent a decade as NASA's ISS program manager, said in a statement . ""We are thrilled to combine Axiom's human spaceflight expertise with Thales Alenia Space's experience to build the next stage of human settlement in low Earth orbit from a foundation that is tried and tested.""

The two components covered by the agreement are Axiom's Habitation Module and a micrometeoroid protection system for the Axiom Node One (a connecting module), both of which will be pressurized, according to the statement. But this will hardly be the first time Thales Alenia sends station components to orbit. In fact, when Axiom launches the completed module, it will dock at a space station node that was built, coincidentally, by Thales Alenia.

""This mission is an important step toward enabling the development of independent commercial destinations and fostering the growth of a strong and competitive low-Earth orbit economy,"" Massimo Comparini, senior executive vice president at Thales Alenia Space, said in the same statement. ""Together with our partner Axiom we are happy to partake in this new enterprise of building the new sustainable low Earth orbit market based on commercial space destinations.""

Under the agreement, the defense company will ensure that the principal components of the air surveillance system will be sustained to meet the requirements of the French armed forces.

Thales will also be required to provide a “360-degree picture” of critical systems status and facilitate support planning to meet the French services’ operational needs.

Additionally, the contract stipulates that the firm must coordinate with the French defense ministry’s military aircraft maintenance service and 14 other companies and organizations for improved logistics support throughout the SCCOA system.

The SCCOA reportedly comprises more than 700 complex systems, including air defense radars, control centers, and ground-air communications and information systems designed to detect and defeat evolving aerial threats.

“The air command and control system plays a key role in airspace protection, enabling the French forces to conduct their missions effectively in France and in overseas theatres of operations,” Thales explained in a press release.

Ensuring Improved Performance

The logistics support contract is part of France’s VASSCO (VerticAlisation du Soutien du SCCOA) program designed to address current and future technological challenges the system may encounter.

The program would also provide a technical and logistics platform to combine the support capabilities of government and defense industries, enabling higher efficiency across the entire logistics support chain.

Press Release: Thales to create highest Wi-Fi hotspot for Airbus project - - Runway Girl Network,"Thu, 13 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvdGhhbGVzLWhpZ2hlc3QtZXZlci13aS1maS1ob3RzcG90LXBlcmxhbi0yLWdsaWRlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales announced today its partnership with Airbus Perlan Mission II, an internationally celebrated and world record setting climate and aerospace research project, which aims to fly Thales’ latest mobile satellite communications system, FlytLink, in a zero-emission glider to more than twice the altitude of a commercial airline flight.

Through this collaboration, the world will get a live, front row view of the stratosphere and hear from glider pilots as they soar to the edge of space via FlytLink. The Nevada-based Airbus Perlan Mission II team is planning for a possible return to flight this year in the U.S. and El Calafate, Argentina.

Airbus Perlan Mission II is an initiative of The Perlan Project, a non-profit, international team of scientists, engineers, and aviators. The group has already set aviation world altitude records in the experimental Perlan 2 glider, which was designed, built and deployed to fly to 90,000 feet without an engine. Originally launched in 2015, the Perlan 2 achieved its highest record-setting flight of above 76,000 feet in 2018. The organization’s mission is to conduct climate, atmospheric and aeronautical research at extreme high altitudes. Applications of their research include informing more accurate climate-change models, innovating fuel-efficient or zero-emission aviation, and even demonstrating the feasibility of using energy-efficient winged aircraft on Mars.

Soaring too high to use ground-based communications, the Perlan 2 glider will be fitted with the FlytLink Thales Iridium Certus based satellite communications (satcom) system. This means that for the first time it will be possible to make a live feed available to STEM students, researchers and aviation enthusiasts around the world while the aircraft is in flight, enabling access to real-time data downloads. FlytLink is the latest generation of Iridium-based satellite communications systems for cockpit and crew operations. Anywhere in the world, whether flying over the poles, the ocean or land, FlytLink offers coverage and connectivity for critical operations. Its resilience, high dependability and low size, weight and power make it adaptable to any aircraft, including gliders such as Perlan.

“We look forward to Perlan 2 carrying the Thales logo as well as one of the company’s most cutting-edge communication solutions to even greater heights,” said Ed Warnock, CEO of The Perlan Project. “By exploring the stratosphere in an airborne research vehicle that creates zero pollution, we hope to unlock discoveries never possible before. Through this exciting partnership with Thales, we also look forward to inspiring new generations of scientists, engineers and pilots in environmentally conscious aviation.”

“We are delighted to support Airbus Perlan Mission II because we believe the project aligns with Thales’ own strategies for future, greener aviation and the environment,” said Marc Duval Destin, Vice-President Strategy, Product Policy and Innovation for Thales’ Flight Avionics activities. ”We hope that the live stream will encourage a new generation of young people to consider careers in aerospace, science and engineering.”

When Perlan 2 reaches its next record-breaking target altitude of over 90,000 feet, it will be the highest a winged aircraft has ever flown in level flight. Equipped with cutting edge aviation technology and using spacecraft engineering, its glider wings can fly in less than 3% of normal air density at temperatures of minus 70 degrees Celsius approximating the atmospheric conditions on Mars.

“Our equipment will be in an unpressurised environment,” added Duval Destin. “So, this is a great opportunity for us to validate the design and performance of our solution in such extremely non-benign conditions.”

Designed to support a wide range of use cases in maritime, land mobile and aviation markets, Thales Iridium Certus based satcom solutions are already used widely among vessels and land/mobile applications to keep critical communications when it is needed at all times, anywhere on the planet.

Space to Explore: returning astronauts to the Moon and space exploration on the agenda in 2021

Thales Alenia Space confirmed its global leadership in orbital infrastructures last year, by confirming the development contract for the communications and refueling module ESPRIT on the upcoming Gateway lunar space station. This business win followed two contracts signed in 2020 to produce the I-HAB and HALO pressurized modules. Gateway is being developed within the scope of NASA’s Artemis program, designed to return astronauts to the Moon by 2024. The lunar space station will also be used as a waystation to prepare crewed missions to Mars.

Thales Alenia Space also announced an order for two more pressurized cargo modules on Cygnus, the resupply vessel for the International Space Station, and won a contract from Axiom Space to build two pressurized modules for the first commercial space station, Axiom.

Thales Alenia Space is also playing a major role on the Orion spacecraft, designed to carry astronauts to the Moon as part of the Artemis program, especially as supplier of thermomechanical systems for the European Service Module (ESM). In 2021, Thales Alenia Space participated in the final integration of critical systems on the second module (ESM 2), and also signed a contract amendment providing for a similar contribution to ESM 4, 5 and 6.

Other highlights in 2021 included significant progress on major programs such as the second ExoMars mission, to be launched in September 2022, and EUCLID, a science mission dedicated to the study of dark energy and matter.

Space to Observe and Protect: second COSMO-SkyMed second-generation satellite ready for launch; SWOT oceanographic satellite passes new milestone

The second COSMO-SkyMed second-generation satellite was shipped from the company’s Rome plant in December 2021 to Cape Canaveral, where it’s now being readied for the planned launch in late January. The second generation of COSMO-SkyMed radar observation satellites is being built by Thales Alenia Space as prime contractor on behalf of the Italian space agency and defense ministry. The payload and platform for SWOT, the French-American oceanographic satellite, were integrated in 2021, a major milestone for this revolutionary satellite, slated for launch in 2022.

Space to Connect: selected for Telesat’s planned constellation and a leading position in the geostationary communications satellite market

Capitalizing on its globally recognized expertise in constellations, Thales Alenia Space was chosen by the operator Telesat in February 2021 to build Lightspeed, a constellation of 298 telecom satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO). The Lightspeed network will offer data rates of several terabits/second worldwide, providing secure, high-speed and high-performance connectivity for professional applications.

Also in February 2021, Thales Alenia Space and Satelit Nusantara Tiga (SNT) announced that they had finalized funding for the development of the Satria broadband communications satellite, designed to bridge the digital divide in Indonesia. This key step follows the preliminary agreement to start various activities for the satellite, signed in early September 2020.

Thales Alenia Space won five new contracts in 2021 as prime contractor for geostationary satellites. We will build the SICRAL 3A and 3B satellites for the Italian Ministry of Defense, the HTS 113BT satellite for the Indonesian operator Telkomsat, and the ASTRA 1P and ASTRA 1Q satellites for the operator SES. The latter two satellites are based, respectively on the all-electric Spacebus NEO platform, proven in orbit, and Space Inspire, the company’s brand new all-digital solution, highly flexible and reconfigurable in orbit in virtually real time. Thales Alenia Space ended the year on a high note with these five satellites, giving it leadership in the geostationary telecom satellite market in 2021.

Space to Travel and Navigate: 6 new satellites for the new-generation Galileo constellation and upgrades to the EGNOS satnav augmentation system ground segment

At the forefront of satellite navigation in Europe, Thales Alenia Space was chosen by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Commission to build 6 of the 12 new satellites in the second-generation Galileo constellation. Thales Alenia Space also signed an extension of the first-generation Galileo mission and security ground segment contract, to continue increasing the system’s operational capacity.

Along with its work on the Galileo satellites, Thales Alenia Space, prime contractor for Europe’s EGNOS navigation overlay system, continued to upgrade the ground system to ensure the integrity needed to address ultra-precise and reliable positioning requirements for new and highly demanding applications. These new uses include autonomous road vehicles, as well as autonomous rail and maritime transport systems. The associated high-reliability integrity and “safety of life” services are already being implemented for aviation. At the same time, Thales Alenia Space successfully carried out several flight demonstrations with ASECNA (air navigation safety agency for Africa and the Indian Ocean), in preparation for a satellite navigation system covering Africa.

Several major satellites with contributions from Thales Alenia Space were launched in 2021



2 geostationary telecom satellites: SES 17 and Syracuse 4A, built by Thales Alenia Space as prime contractor for SES and the French Ministry of the Armed Forces, respectively. Both use the Spacebus NEO platform with all-electric propulsion.

2 Cygnus resupply vessels for the International Space Station. Since the outset of this program, Thales Alenia Space has supplied all pressurized cargo modules for Cygnus, totaling 20 to date, on behalf of Northrop Grumman.

3 CERES military signals intelligence (SIGINT) satellites, with Thales Alenia Space supplying the platforms.

Thales Alenia Space continues to invest in the space ecosystem, with the recent opening of a digital center of excellence, investments in satellite integration and pressurized module production at its industrial facilities, and the development of FabLabs across Europe.

A number of key capital investments were made in 2021. Thales Alenia Space expanded its European footprint by creating a digital center of excellence in Luxembourg. The Madrid plant now features a state-of-the-art satellite integration center, and Turin has doubled production capacity for pressurized modules. A new FabLab has been inaugurated in Charleroi, Belgium, along the lines of those already up and running in Toulouse, Cannes, Rome and Turin. These FabLabs are designed to stimulate employee creativity and foster an innovation-based culture across the company. Through these FabLabs, employees can submit ideas that could result in concrete improvements through both professional and personal projects.

The Carbon Disclosure Project has awarded Thales the highest level of recognition for its environmental practices. Sophie Le Pennec, Thales Group Vice President for Health, Safety & Environment, explains the importance of this recognition.

What is the Carbon Disclosure Project and why is its rating of Thales important?

The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) is an international non-profit organisation started in 2000. Every year since 2003, the CDP has gathered information from cities, regions and companies around the world to measure their environmental impact and, in particular, companies’ greenhouse gas emissions and climate strategies.

In December, the CDP announced that Thales was ranked at the highest level, ‘Leadership’, (A/A-), which recognises companies that have adopted best practices in the fight against climate change.

This recognition is very encouraging for us, since the CDP is a leading international organisation that, unlike other initiatives, takes into account the requirements of the Paris Agreement and the recommendations of the IPCC1 and TCFD2 . The CDP maintains the largest database on the environmental performance of cities, regions and companies and encourages them to develop a committed strategy and measure their environmental impact so they can take concrete action. Its annual ranking is closely monitored by investors and customers.



How does the CDP determine its ratings? What criteria does it use?

The CDP uses ‘Level of Engagement’ scores and rates companies from A to D- based on their actions and environmental impact in three areas: climate change, forests and water security.

A company is rated within one of four categories reflecting different levels of governance and management: leadership (A), or implementation of best practices; management of environmental risks (B); awareness (C), or an understanding of the importance of environmental issues; and disclosure (D). Companies must provide all the required information and answer all the questions in an extensive questionnaire that the CDP updates each year.

Thales was recognised in particular for its moves to reduce its CO2 emissions, for its Scope 1, 2 and 3 commitments, for the robust system of governance it has put in place to implement the Group's low-carbon policy and, above all, for its results.

Last year, of the nearly 12,000 companies surveyed, only 200 received an A/A- for their climate change efforts.

So does that mean Thales is one of the best in the industry?

Yes. This rating reflects the environmental and sustainable development efforts of all Thales employees, as well as the commitments made by the Group within its broader policy on social and environmental responsibility, also called CSR3 , or ESG4 in financial circles. We intend to accelerate that policy, as we announced on 5 October at our first Investor Day dedicated to ESG issues (Thales accelerates its ESG action plan to help build a safer, greener, more inclusive world | Thales Group).



What were the key objectives of the action plan announced in early October?

The Group announced that it is aiming to achieve a 35% reduction in operational CO2 emissions by 2023, a 50% reduction by 2030 and ‘net zero’ by 2040. These targets are consistent with the Paris Agreement’s objectives of limiting global warming to 1.5°C.

In addition, Thales has pledged that 100% of its new products and services will be eco-designed by 2023, and the Group will engage more methodically with suppliers to support their own efforts to reduce carbon emissions, with 100% of the action plans of the 150 most polluting suppliers analysed and launched by 2023. It will also engage with partners in the supply chain to bring them into line with its goal of cutting emissions by 50% by 2030.

Thales will continue to challenge its commitments and will review its targets for other emissions this year. In 2022, it will submit its roadmaps to begin the SBTi5 (Science-Based Target initiative) certification process and have them validated by a reputable third party.

In addition to these efforts, Thales will continue to leverage its knowledge to combat climate change, whether in the civil aviation sector, where its systems can optimise flight paths and aircraft operations, in sensors and satellites, to expand space-based surveillance capabilities and better understand climate phenomena, or in artificial intelligence, where Thales is the first company to develop ""frugal"" AI based on algorithms that only require small amounts of energy.

“Last year, of the nearly 12,000 companies surveyed by the CDP, only 200 received an A/A- for their climate change efforts, including Thales.”

From improved diagnosis and treatment to streamlined processes and predictive maintenance, Artificial Intelligence is bringing many benefits to the healthcare sector. Beatriz Matesanz, MIS Innovation & IrixX Business Segment Director at Thales, tells us more.

What is Artificial Intelligence bringing to the healthcare sector?

© Thales

Beatriz Matesanz: One of the biggest trends in medicine today is the personalization of treatment for each patient. Artificial Intelligence is a wonderful tool to achieve this. With AI, we will be able to correlate data from different sources – such as patient history, biomarkers and imagery - in order to tailor and optimize the treatment for patients.

This could be the case for example for someone with a rare illness. Healthcare professionals can benefit from years of medical history and data from many other individuals for diagnosis and treatments, with AI algorithms trained to identify principal symptoms and successful treatments. At least two main benefits result from this; anticipation in the treatment itself as well as better prognosis for the next steps.

Globally, AI will play an increasing role in all areas of patient care, including prevention, diagnosis, treatment and prognostics.

Specifically in the medical imaging sector, how is Thales using AI?

Today, the main benefits of AI in medical imaging are the assistance this can provide through second opinion diagnosis, and the optimizing of workflow in hospitals or health centres. In order to achieve this, Thales is focusing its use of AI in two areas: optimized CAD (Computed Assisted Diagnosis) modules for our X-Ray detectors and imaging software, and predictive maintenance modules for our customer’s equipment.

Today, the main benefits of AI in medical imaging are the assistance this can provide through second opinion diagnosis, and the optimizing of workflow in hospitals or health centres.

Optimizing the workflow of image acquisition can begin for instance with automatic body part recognition, which will save a number of manual clicks during image acquisition. With hundreds of millions of X-Ray scans performed annually, automated identification and classification of body parts helps build incredibly useful data management tools and systems. Secondly, the CAD module helps radiologists with their diagnosis by providing a second opinion that will help them to make a final assessment on the image. The algorithm results provided - comparing patient results to an average based on a cross-section of the population for example - can serve as a simple backup check on the diagnosis. Radiologists can then dedicate the time they have saved to the more complicated cases.

Beatriz Matesanz presented the topic in this video for Expo 2020 in Dubai. The video is part of a series in the France pavillion looking at different aspects of Artificial Intelligence.

What about after sales and predictive maintenance?

The equipment we provide to customers will be available with built-in predictive maintenance algorithms and modules. This increases the availability of their medical devices by anticipating failures before they happen, ensuring the non-disruption of hospital workflows. An example would be x-ray detectors sending logs to the maintenance algorithm monitoring them and correlating with known failure patterns in order to give an exchange recommendation before the detector fails.

With the increasing use of AI in the medical sector, how can we be sure that our personal health data is secure?

First of all, data sharing between healthcare providers and AI system builders is subject to strict data protection laws. The capacity of healthcare providers to share personal patient data with an AI system builder for any purpose not connected with the direct care of a patient is therefore severely constrained.

As a global player in the cybersecurity and connectivity domains, Thales pays very close attention to the security of medical data.

It is important though that all players keep in mind that cyberattacks against the healthcare sector are increasing across the world. As a global player in the cybersecurity and connectivity domains, Thales pays very close attention to the security of medical data. All of the AI algorithms we use function with anonymized data. Additionally, Thales solutions - including naturally our X-Ray detectors and imaging software - are ‘cybersecured by design’, respecting medical field standards and regulations. Continuous monitoring of new threats as well as software updates ensure that patient data is always secure.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9997784495353699}",positive,0.9997784495353699,1

The digital transformation has led to a need for greater speed and flexibility in every major sector, and for any organisation that needs to stay one step ahead, meeting the security challenges of today and tomorrow is more crucial than ever. This is the purpose of Thales’s Security Digital Platform, which was recently awarded a Janus de l’Industrie label of excellence by the French Design Institute.

The Security Digital Platform (SDP) assists security personnel in their work and helps to optimise site protection thanks to a software suite that guarantees continuity of critical services and supports industries and organisations in charge of keeping people and property safe. Security data from the customer’s surveillance sensors is aggregated and analysed by a security application in the cloud, which is constantly updated and adapted as needs and technologies evolve.

In late 2021, the Thales solution was awarded a Janus de l’Industrie label by the French Design Institute, whose panel of judges were impressed by the SDP’s innovative technology.

“We co-designed the Security Digital Platform with law enforcement agencies to ensure that our solution matches their real operational needs,” says Gérard Herby, VP, Protection Systems Business Line, Thales. “The solution is the result of close collaboration between Thales engineers, designers and end users. Its simple, configurable interface is ideal for operators that constantly need to adapt to changing deployment scenarios and new demands on the ground.”

The Janus award has once again turned the spotlight on Thales’s potential for innovation and proven ability to provide comprehensive solutions for security personnel based on ambitious co-design and development principles.

Happy Birthday Iridium NEXT - Thales,"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbmV3cy9oYXBweS1iaXJ0aGRheS1pcmlkaXVtLW5leHQtMNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Five years ago, on January 14, 2017, under sunny Californian skies, the first ten Iridium® NEXT satellites were sent aloft from Vandenberg Air Force Base (now called Vandenberg Space Force Base). We didn’t know it then, but this launch would be a milestone in the history of spaceborne constellations, since it kicked off the replacement of the entire Iridium® system. In the space of just two years, a fast-paced series of eight launches would orbit 75 Iridium® NEXT satellites – a stellar performance. The fully operational constellation entered service on February 5, 2019.

First Iridium NEXT launch, five years ago

For those unfamiliar with the program, Iridium® NEXT fully replaced all satellites in the Iridium® network, a constellation of telecommunications satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO), comprising 66 operational satellites in six orbital planes each containing 11 satellites, all interconnected and operating at an altitude of 780 kilometers. The constellation also includes nine in-orbit spares and six ground spares. Each satellite weighed 850 kilograms at launch, equivalent to a small car.

The upgraded global Iridium® network offers currently unmatched capacity for truly global mobile communications – serving people, vehicles, planes and boats. Renowned for its robustness and sophistication, this complex system is the only one of its kind able to operate over the seas and oceans that make up 70% of the Earth’s surface, as well as polar areas.

Satellite crosslinks mean that the constellation operates independently of ground infrastructures, providing more secure telecommunications and protection against intruders and spoofing. The constellation can also help maintain vital telecommunications services in the wake of natural disasters like typhoons, hurricanes and tsunamis.

A few days ago, it was also the third anniversary of the eighth and final Iridium® NEXT launch on January 11, 2019.

Thales Alenia Space, the gold standard in satellite constellations

As prime contractor for the Globalstar 2, O3b and Iridium® NEXT programs, Thales Alenia Space has acquired world-renowned expertise in telecom satellite constellations in low and medium Earth orbits. We have built on this unrivaled heritage to address new markets in partnership with startups in high-revisit-rate Earth observation (BlackSky), space surveillance and space debris detection (Skylark), and the Internet of Things (IoT), with programs such as ANGELS and Kineis. The credentials gained from working on large-scale constellations have enabled Thales Alenia Space to make its grand entrance into the New Space sphere. Also, largely thanks to Iridium® NEXT, we were selected last year by Canadian operator Telesat to build its Lightspeed satellite Internet network featuring optical inter-satellite links, comprising 298 LEO satellites.

On December 18, 2019, Arianespace successfully launched a Soyuz rocket from the Guiana Space Center, Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana, with no less than five satellites aboard: Italy’s first second-generation COSMO-SkyMed radar observation satellite; CHEOPS, an iconic ESA mission to characterize exoplanets; and three CubeSats, including ANGELS, the first nanosatellite designed by Hemeria in conjunction with French space agency CNES for the Argos system. The ANGELS payload was developed by Thales Alenia Space as lead contractor.

Two years after launch, ANGELS is still fully operational in orbit, and its original design life of two years has been extended to four and a half years. CNES recently confirmed the successful downloading of a new version of the Argos Neo software developed by Thales Alenia Space.

The new version offers key functions, since they will enable Kineis to test a new bandwidth on ANGELS and analyze the entire spectrum covered by the Kineis constellation, now under development.

This latest success validates the technology decisions made during the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) payload, including native geolocation, and shows the in-flight flexibility and agility of our solution. It also expands Thales Alenia Space’s industrial footprint in the IoT market, reflecting its strong presence in “New Space” developments.





About ANGELS

ANGELS joined 2 years ago the Argos service fleet operated by Kineis, a subsidiary of CLS, the legacy operator of the Argos system. ANGELS is a French space agency mission coordinated by Hemeria, which also produced the nanosat platform (12U CubeSat). The Argos Neo payload was developed by Thales Alenia Space as lead contractor, with Syrlinks, a manufacturer of radio-communications equipment and geolocation systems, as major partner. Syrlinks built the data collection instruments that send data from the emergency beacons to the satellites, and then down to the ground stations. These instruments feature very powerful processing units to handle all data.

Some 20,000 beacons are permanently connected to ARGOS, supplying key data that helps us better understand and protect our planet and ensure the sustainable management of natural resources. The capabilities offered by ANGELS and the future Kineis constellation will make a strategic contribution to protecting our environment and could well revolutionize our understanding of the Earth.

France has ""high-level engineers""

Patrice Caine, Chairman & Chief Executive officer of the technology group Thales, talks about 21st century warfare, the benefits of satellite technology, even in our everyday lives, and the company's strong roots in Western France.

They say you are the eyes and ears of the submarine fleet…

I just watched « Le chant du Loup » again (a movie about a French nuclear submarine sent to recover special forces troops on the ground, but things don't go as planned. The film's title refers to the name given by French naval personnel to the sound of an enemy sonar searching for your submarine – ed.) and I enjoyed it just as much as the first time. The sonars designed by Thales are mind-blowing. We're very proud to be working for Naval Group and the French Navy, and with Dassault for naval aircraft. And we have again been recognised by the US Navy, which is a customer of ours for certain cutting-edge technologies that they can't find in the United States: for example, we are equipping the US Navy and the Coast Guards. It's a sign of our global excellence. Our Brest site (1,800 employees) has played a prominent role in developing this highly specialised expertise. Dipping sonars are a very fine success story.

Military drones raise important ethical questions.

Dipping sonars?

These sonars are deployed by helicopters to hunt for submarines. How do they find them? If you've seen The Wolf's Call you will probably remember the machines that are lowered by cable and dipped a few metres into the sea. That's why they're called dipping sonars. They emit sound waves that are reflected by any submarine that happens to be in the vicinity. This underwater acoustics expertise is also needed for other applications like mine countermeasures.

Aren't mines outdated in an age of electronic warfare?

You're thinking about those round things with spikes that were used in the Second World War? We obviously read the same comic books! Yes, these mines are unfortunately still around. To neutralise them, we will be using surface drones, which are like little autonomous boats with no crew. The surface drones carry little robots equipped with sonars that map the bottom of the sea and detect everything between the seabed and the surface. Then another type of robot is sent in to destroy the mines with an explosive charge. So yes, mines are indeed part of 21st century warfare.

Where are they used today?

They are used in places like the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea. They're a big danger because they're extremely difficult to detect. They can even be concealed inside washing machines and dumped at the bottom of the sea, or made to look like rocks. It's the types of metals used that makes it possible to detect them in those cases.

It's possible to kill people remotely, using drones for example. Don't these new forms of warfare pose ethical problems for you?

You're quite right that military drones raise important ethical questions. But decisions about using them are made by the government and the head of State elected by universal suffrage. It's up to them to decide what is authorised or not, and what is sold or not sold to a given country. As defence minister Florence Parly has said, you can't put the tobacco industry, for example, in the same category as defence, which is about keeping us all safe. There won't be a future at all if we destroy the planet and the environment. But neither will there be a future if our governments are unable to guarantee the security and stability of our democracies. We mustn't be naive.

What are you most concerned about?

After the fall of the Berlin Wall, some people foresaw a very long period of peace. And yet we are entering an age of greater and greater conflict, even in space. We are facing a level of geopolitical tension that we haven't seen for a long time. There are latent conflicts, sometimes even armed conflicts, in our own back yard. Look what's happening in Ukraine. CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) or ESG ([extra-]financial criteria) is a topic of major importance and a compass to guide the actions we take to build a safer, greener and more inclusive world. In strictly financial terms, the challenge in Europe is to make [investment] management companies aware of the role that defence plays in our democracies so they can put the right value on our industrial activities. Investment funds in the United States have fully assimilated the fact that you can't have sustainable development without stability.

You talk a lot about threats to our democracies. But a European defence capability is struggling to take shape…

Europe isn't all one piece like the United States. It isn't a country but a cathedral that has been built, piece by piece, over time. Some things are moving ahead, others not so much. Let's look at the bright side: for the first time, Europe has just set up a European Defence Fund, which will finance research programmes. Several cooperation programmes have been successes: the Tiger (Franco-German attack helicopter) and the NH90 (European transport helicopter) are fantastic technological successes.

And although the A400M programme was hard to complete, we now have the only aircraft of its kind in the world (the programme experienced various technical and financial difficulties; the aircraft can be used to refuel helicopters in flight – ed.). It was a tour de force by Airbus. There is growing awareness of the importance of defence, even in the countries that have not been sensitive to these issues in the past. We need to be realistic and optimistic. We can also be reasonably hopeful because as an industry, we are working on major programmes with long cycles.

These strong roots in France are a good indicator of the expertise we have here.

Do you agree with the analysis that France is losing its place in the big league?

No, absolutely not. We are among the world leaders in several sectors, and Brittany is a contributor. In Étrelles (Ille-et-Vilaine), for example, we produce very high-tech electronic circuit boards that are used in the radars for Dassault's Rafale aircraft. The Brest (Finistère) site is a global benchmark for underwater acoustics. And the Cholet (Maine-et-Loire) site, which will soon celebrate its 100th anniversary, specialises in secure military communications. International markets account for 80% of our revenues. Yet half of our workforce, three-quarters of our fundamental research and two-thirds of our R&D are based in France, in part because of the key role of the French defence procurement agency (DGA). These strong roots in France are a good indicator of the expertise we have here. One of the strengths of our country and its regions is having access to the very high-level engineers that a group like ours needs to drive its growth and development. That can sometimes be a problem in other countries, like the United States, which until now has used targeted immigration from Asia, including China, to fill the gap.

Satellites will help to bridge the digital divide

© Yann Coatsaliou, AFP

Has Europe lost the battle for space?

Not at all! Some people have focused on launch vehicles, which is one area where the Americans have indeed moved very fast with SpaceX. But SpaceX is just one part of the space sector, not the whole story! Launch vehicles are needed, of course, and Europe has Ariane, so yes, Ariane also needed to develop reusable launch vehicles. In any case, things happen in steps and stages in every industry. Ariane has negotiated the turn, and when I look at Thales Alenia Space and the European satellite industry, we are definitely at world-class level.

Thales Alenia Space – our space business – built almost all the satellite constellations in service today. We even won the latest constellation in a competitive tender: three years from now, it will be operated by the Canadian company Telesat, whose funding is now being finalised, and will have been entirely built by Thales Alenia Space – in France, I may add. We have nothing to envy from Elon Musk: this constellation will be just as powerful as Starlink but with 300 satellites instead of 6,000. So in terms of space pollution, we are in a much better position.

What's the point of it all?

Space is the stuff of dreams. You can observe all sorts of things from space that you couldn't see from Earth. With climate change, for example, satellites built by Thales Alenia Space for the European Space Agency (ESA) provide precise measurements of greenhouse gases, sea levels and temperatures, the chemical composition of the oceans, and the level of pollution and ice-melt. Space exploration is also one of the few areas where international collaboration is still alive and well – it requires so many financial, human, intellectual resources. The Perseverance rover (the vehicle developed by NASA to explore Mars – ed.) is a fantastic machine. We designed the new-generation laser that equips Supercam. It is used to heat Martian rock to 1,000 degrees: by pulverising it and measuring the wavelengths of the light it gives off, it is possible to deduce the chemical composition of the Martian soil.

How does space affect our daily lives?

In the past, satellite communications were only used by a few privileged people or the armed forces as a way of staying in touch 24/7, or in atypical applications like the Vendée Globe yacht race. Tomorrow, satellite communications will be useful for providing remote areas with broadband Internet access. Satellites are the only way to bridge the digital divide for all and to make it possible to work remotely, follow distance-learning courses or consult a doctor from a chalet high in the mountains – where it wouldn't make economic sense to install optical fibre. In mid-2022, we are going to launch Konnect VHTS, the world's most powerful communications satellite, which will be operated by Eutelsat. In France, subscribers will be able to sign up with Orange for an Internet connection with the same quality of service as fibre.

With the takeover of Gemalto, you also have also conquered the market for smartcards…

Put simply, we're talking about payment cards or the SIM card in your telephone. But the technological feat is being able to make the highly secure (little) software program inside the card that establishes your identity. The public health crisis suddenly led to a huge increase in contactless payments – of up to €50 to limit the risks if your card is stolen. For higher amounts, we have developed a payment card with a fingerprint scanner, which has been available from BNP Paribas since last autumn and is the first card of its kind in the world. We are also developing software for the police that can reconstitute fingerprints found at crime scenes so they can be compared with the databases.

You have teamed with Google in the cloud (Internet data hosting). Isn't it a threat to our sovereignty?

We also work with other cloud providers like OVH in France. In fact, we offer various different solutions depending on the level of security required by each of our customers in terms of data protection and/or nationality. There's a secure cloud solution for every customer. Sovereignty is a very important word, referring to anything that puts the State or the nation in danger. For example, we have developed a ""restricted level"" cloud solution that offers an extremely demanding level of security and could be used by the defence ministry and its partners, and we have also developed a defence cloud solution that has been selected by NATO.

We wouldn't want the United States peeking at our family photos!

In that case, don't put them in a cloud that isn't secure! If you want storage that's easy to use and inexpensive, the cloud is a good solution. But your family photos have nothing to do with sovereignty.

On the other hand, you might want to use a solution offered by one of the big American cloud providers without letting them manage your encryption keys, in other words the security of your data. In that case, you can use a trusted third party like Thales. With Google, we have put several mechanisms in place to protect data from foreign interference: it's stored on servers and datacentres in France, and can only be accessed by people accredited by Thales.

How do you attract young talent to work for you instead of Google?

This year, Thales plans to hire 11,000 people, including 3,500 in France. A lot of them are attracted by the diversity of our sectors of activity and the wide variety of job types we offer – everything from ethical hacking to exploring Mars or the Moon! I think we can also offer extra meaning. After the terrorist attacks in Paris, we saw a sort of ""call to vocation"". When you devote your time to the security of your country, for example by serving the armed forces, you're bound to feel you are doing a little more than just showing up to work.

Thanks to features such as lightweight design, state of art propellant grain and reduced FOD, Thales 70mm/2.75-ich rockets are used worldwide by more than 75 armed forces across more than 50 countries. The rockets have also been officially adopted by many major platform Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEMs) where their performance and reliability are clearly recognized and the ability to deliver a single rocket solution for air, vehicle and ground based platforms provides the ultimate battlefield utility.

Arnold Defense’s launchers are versatile and allow the user to select from a range of certified rocket systems to suit their specific needs, or their own in-service inventory. Adding the new Thales FZ275 70mm/2.75-inch rockets to the Arnold Defense certified rocket portfolio significantly extends their global capability offering.

Stéphane Bianchi, Director of the Airborne Armament business segment at Thales said: “This is the second test firing and certification project in partnership with Arnold Defense and extends both companies’ portfolios and offering to regular and Special Forces. Thales 70mm/2.75-inch rocket systems now provide a one stop shop to deliver precision guided accuracy against fixed and mobile targets across the full spectrum of delivery platforms now including ground troops.”

Frank Ferrante, Vice President of Programs and Business Development at Arnold Defense said: “Arnold Defense is excited to have achieved this additional certification following a highly successful series of live firing tests. We can now add the FZ275 Thales 70mm/2.75-inch rockets to the wide range of rockets that can be fired from Arnold Defense launchers, thus increasing the flexibility of our offer to the global user.” He added, “Arnold Defense works hard to meet the future needs of our customers and this project, in partnership with Thales, delivers a significant capability enhancement to ground troops operating remotely and unsupported, increasing the range and precision of their strike without relying on air or aviation platforms.”

The impressive James Webb Space Telescope, the most powerful telescope of this kind ever made, was successfully launched by Arianespace on December 25, 2021. A joint program between NASA and its counterparts in Europe (ESA) and Canada (CSA), Webb will observe the beginnings of our Universe by reaching back in time to just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. It will also observe exoplanets – planets outside the Solar System – that are comparable to our own, as well as the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies. The ultimate aim of this successor to the iconic Hubble space telescope is to discover galaxies that reach back to the relative beginnings of the Universe. This state-of-the-art time machine is expected to revolutionize all aspects of modern astronomy. It will unveil the hidden side of the Universe, namely stars enveloped in clouds of dust, molecules in the atmosphere of other worlds, and the light issuing from the first stars and galaxies.

Webb stands out!



The key to Webb’s outstanding capabilities is its huge primary mirror, made of 18 hexagonal segments and stretching 6.5 meters (21 feet) in diameter. The mirror is 100 times more sensitive that Hubble, with the ability to detect the extremely faint light emanating from distant stars and galaxies. Webb is fitted with four main instruments, imagers and spectrometers.

Both instruments and mirror are protected by a huge heat shield, comprising five ultra-thin layers. It will enable the observatory to resist extreme temperature fluctuations, ranging from +110°C to -235°C.

The satellite is now en route towards its final orbital position at the second Lagrange point (L2), about a million and a half kilometers from Earth. Unlike Hubble, which orbits the Earth, James Webb will orbit around the Sun. It will stay in constant alignment with both Sun and Earth, “behind” the latter. Furthermore, the mirror will always have its “back” to our planet.

The James Webb Space Telescope weighed 6.2 metric tons at launch and offers a design life of ten years.

Mission summary



The Webb telescope will gather light in a slightly different part of the spectrum than its older brother. While Hubble observes the Universe in bandwidths from ultraviolet to near infrared, Webb will cover the spectrum from visible to medium infrared. This means the new space telescope will be able to study the infrared light emitted by the first stars and galaxies, as well as other planetary systems.

Webb will observe all phases in cosmic history, looking for the first stars and galaxies to be formed, as well as all forms of life, while also studying the evolution of galaxies and how current stars and planets came to be.

Thales Alenia Space’s role on James Webb



A transponder made in Italy to communicate across deep space

Program prime contractor Northrop Grumman chose Thales Alenia Space in Italy to build the transponder enabling the spacecraft to communicate from deep space. This device drew on the company’s long experience with making long-range transponders for a variety of deep space missions, starting with Cassini/Huygens, then Mars Express, Venus Express, Rosetta, Lisa Pathfinder, Gaia and now the BepiColombo mission on its way to Mercury.



MIRI electronics, made in Belgium

Thales Alenia Space in Belgium supplied the integrated control electronics (ICE) for the optical module on MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument), a collaboration between Europe and the United States. MIRI comprises two main parts: spectrometers and the MIRIM imager module.

Thales Traveling Wave Tube amplifiers making possible the data transmission with Earth

All data and images collected by the James Webb Space Telescope will be downloaded to Earth using a microwave link. To deal with huge distances, millions to billions of kilometers, microwaves are amplified by Thales Microwave & Imaging Sub-systems’ Travelling Wave Tubes (TWT).

Congratulations to the Above Water Systems Guided Missile Destroyer (DDG) Team for being recognised for the success of the DDG 1MC Blackspot Remediation Project.

‘1MC’ is the name of the main broadcast system on board the Hobart Class DDGs, like a public announcement system, used to transmit information, orders to all ship spaces and most importantly, also used to alert personnel of safety issues such as fire incidents and toxic hazards.

Navy identified ‘Blackspots’ in the audible coverage of the Main Broadcast system in the DDG, a critical safety issue, as Command and Control broadcasts were inaudible in multiple compartments throughout the ship. The Destroyer Enterprise delivered a complex Engineering Change to address this issue at a speed that exceeded all customer expectations. The overall project was estimated to be 18-24 months duration; however, was delivered on budget in only six months reducing a significant safety risk to the ship’s company.



Thales’s Neelan Koovarjee, Deputy Combat System Portfolio Manager, DDG MC and David Pringle, Combat System Maintenance Engineering Lead received personal recognition at the DDG Clear Lower Deck Commendations for their exemplary performance for the 1MC Blackspots Engineering Change they were involved with (successful installation of the 1MC solution). Neelan and David were proud to accept the award on behalf of the Thales team, which also included the Production team for HMAS Hobart’s Ship Refit Availability as well as Electrical and Structural Design Teams within AWS.

Neelan and David were commended for their “significant efforts which have directly contributed to the Destroyer Enterprise performance in delivering seaworthy DDG platforms whilst improving the material state of the fleet at the same time.”

The Project was also a Finalist in the 2021 Thales Australia Gala Awards and nominated for the BAE’s Annual CEO Award.

Neelan said, “The biggest challenge for me was coordinating so many stakeholders within the DDG Enterprise (Raytheon, Thales, BAE, RAN / Commonwealth), performing a review of the engineering deliverables in a short space of time, and quickly identifying areas of risk that needed to be resolved before the design could be approved. I was also communicating regularly with the customer (RAN) to report on progress and issues that needed to be resolved together.”

Without the team’s efforts, the upgrade to the ship would not have been possible in this timeframe and the critical safety upgrade being delayed.

Positive feedback from Hobart was received immediately after implementing the Engineering Change. LEUT Jeffrey Mandryk, HMAS Hobart Deputy Weapons Electrical Engineering Officer (DWEEO) said, “I just wanted to say thank you again for all the work that went into the 1MC upgrade. Just wanted to communicate how much of a positive impact this change has had on the ship!” LEUT Thomas Robertson, Combat Engineer Destroyer Group said, “It’s rare to get such positive feedback so immediately, no doubt we will hear similar things from Sydney and Brisbane following their upcoming installs. I wanted to pass on our thanks for the work you and your teams have done in achieving this outcome.”

Above Water Systems is proud of Neelan, David and the team for achieving this outcome and the work they do to help our Navy keep Australia safe.

A further congratulations goes to our AWS employees who also received DDG Clear Lower Deck commendations:","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9074401259422302}",neutral,0.9074401259422302,0

FlytLink offers coverage and connectivity for critical operations. Its resilience, high dependability and low size, weight and power make it adaptable to any aircraft.

World record setting

Thales, the French multinational in aerospace and defence, does so in partnership with Airbus Perlan Mission II, climate and aerospace research project, that Thales itself decribes as “internationally celebrated and world record setting”. Through this collaboration, the world will get a live, front row view of the stratosphere and hear from glider pilots as they soar to the edge of space via FlytLink.

Airbus Perlan Mission II is an initiative of The Perlan Project, a non-profit, international team of scientists, engineers, and aviators. The group has already set aviation world altitude records in the experimental Perlan 2 glider, which was designed, built and deployed to fly to 90,000 feet without an engine.

First time live feed

Originally launched in 2015, the Perlan 2 achieved its highest record-setting flight of above 76,000 feet in 2018. The organization’s mission is to conduct climate, atmospheric and aeronautical research at extreme high altitudes. Applications of their research include informing more accurate climate-change models, innovating fuel-efficient or zero-emission aviation, and even demonstrating the feasibility of using energy-efficient winged aircraft on Mars.

Soaring too high to use ground-based communications, the Perlan 2 glider will be fitted with the FlytLink Thales Iridium Certus based satellite communications (satcom) system. This means that for the first time it will be possible to make a live feed available to students, researchers and aviation enthusiasts around the world while the aircraft is in flight, enabling access to real-time data downloads. FlytLink is the latest generation of Iridium-based satellite communications systems for cockpit and crew operations.

The Nevada-based Airbus Perlan Mission II team is planning for a possible return to flight this year in the U.S. and El Calafate, Argentina.

Smartphone users can make calls knowing they helping to combat global warming thanks to new “Eco-SIM” cards made by Thales using 100% recycled plastic from old refrigerators.

Gamma Communications plc has chosen Thales’s Eco-SIM cards to deploy across its network of channel partners and business mobile customers to promote a more environmentally friendly, sustainable product.

This announcement of an expanded partnership is a major step in making the telecommunications market more sustainable by providing a green plastics supply flow to Gamma.

Around 4.5 billion SIM cards are produced every year, using 20,000 tons of plastic. Thales’s Eco-SIM, developed in partnership with Veolia over three years, is the first of its kind to be made from upcycled plastic.

The card is manufactured out of 100% recycled polystyrene recovered from the internal padding of discarded refrigerators, saving nearly 5,000 metric tonnes of newly manufactured polystyrene each year and reducing its manufacturing carbon footprint by 15,000 tonnes annually.

And at the end of its life, the recycled plastic from each 4-gramme Eco-SIM card can also be reprocessed to produce new plastic parts.

Thales has supplied SIM cards, applications and device management services to Gamma since 2016 and the switch to Eco-SIM provides an opportunity for both companies to progress their ecological transformation and contribute to a recycling economy.

The project will also benefit from Thales’s carbon offsetting programme, which includes reforestation and development in renewable energies, to ensure that manufacture of the Eco-Sim is certified CarbonNeutral®.

This reflects both companies’ long-term commitment for safeguarding the environment and Gamma’s certification as a Carbon Neutral company.

Emmanuel Unguran, VP Mobile & Connectivity Solutions at Thales said: “Business should constantly be looking for new and innovative ways to connect with customers, meet their needs and respond to their priorities.

“This development of our existing partnership highlights both Thales’s and Gamma’s commitment to greater sustainability and taking responsibility for our impact on the environment which is what our customers expect of us. We also think it’s so cool that mobile phone components can be made from recycled refrigerators!”

The announcement will allow Gamma to become the first network to go carbon neutral in its sector.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9957283139228821}",positive,0.9957283139228821,1
LAP's automated water phantom streamlines commissioning and QA of MR-Linac machines – Physics World - physicsworld.com,"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vcGh5c2ljc3dvcmxkLmNvbS9hL2xhcHMtYXV0b21hdGVkLXdhdGVyLXBoYW50b20tc3RyZWFtbGluZXMtY29tbWlzc2lvbmluZy1hbmQtcWEtb2YtbXItbGluYWMtbWFjaGluZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The THALES 3D MR SCANNER from LAP is helping medical physicists to fast-track QA test routines on their MR-guided radiotherapy systems, while a new iteration of the phantom delivers similar workflow efficiencies on bore-type linacs

User-friendly QA: thanks to its lightweight design, LAP’s THALES 3D MR SCANNER is easily transferred from the carriage system to the patient couch. (Courtesy: LAP)

Following the full product launch in the spring of last year, the THALES 3D MR SCANNER has emerged as something of a game-changer in the radiation oncology clinic, providing a “gold-standard dose accuracy check” for medical physics teams tasked with overseeing the acceptance and ongoing verification of the new generation of MR-guided radiotherapy (MR/RT) systems.

Developed by laser and radiotherapy QA specialist LAP, the THALES 3D MR SCANNER provides the radiotherapy physicist with a 3D and MR-compatible motorized water phantom that’s tailored specifically for streamlined commissioning and QA of MR-Linac treatment machines. By necessity, the phantom is MR-conditional – i.e. all system components are made from non-ferromagnetic materials certified for use within the MRI scanner’s magnetic field – while the automated set-up (which takes under 15 minutes to prepare) and predefined measurement sequences are intended to help the medical physics team save time and simplify their test routines.

“It’s still early days, but we’re really encouraged by the clinical response and uptake of the THALES 3D MR SCANNER within the MR/RT user community,” explains Thierry Mertens, a physicist himself and LAP’s business development manager for healthcare.

Prioritizing workflow efficiency

Commercially, too, there’s no shortage of momentum for LAP’s new water phantom. Significant milestones ticked off in the first quarter of 2021 include 510(k) regulatory approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), while the subsequent CE mark has enabled LAP to ramp up installations with clinical customers in the European Economic Area (EEA). In both regions, the phantom comes with a yearly maintenance visit, software and hardware updates, and a configurable multiyear warranty.

Thierry Mertens: “It’s all about confidence and trust.” (Courtesy: LAP)

The traction with early-adopting clinical sites in the US and EEA is doubly important. After all, it’s feedback from these customers that will shape the development roadmap for the THALES 3D MR SCANNER in 2022 and beyond. Near term, it seems, product innovation is rooted in LAP’s relentless focus on workflow efficiency. “We are enhancing the phantom’s software functionality with this in mind – and specifically the introduction of a continuous scanning mode,” notes Mertens. “In this way, radiotherapy physicists will be able to spend less time on their machine QA so that they can focus on other important tasks.”

While the initial version of the phantom is optimized for the QA of ViewRay’s MRIdian MR/RT system, Mertens and colleagues are working on a custom water phantom to support Elekta’s Unity MR-Linac machine. The development work is already advanced, with LAP’s product development engineers in collective exchange with Elekta Unity clinical end-users. “The voice of the radiotherapy clinical user is fundamental to our requirements-gathering and for understanding – at a granular level – how the MR-Linac is being put to work in a clinical context,” Mertens adds.

Independent verification

At the clinical sharp-end, of course, it’s the medical physicist who is ultimately accountable for safe and effective MR/RT treatment delivery. This is where independent QA and verification tools – like the THALES 3D MR SCANNER – really come into their own, providing rigorous beam data and beam model visualizations to verify that the delivered radiation as it applies to the patient is indeed correct.

Operationally, the THALES 3D MR SCANNER is being deployed alongside a portfolio of QA tools – some providing daily, weekly and monthly QA checks, with the water phantom reserved for system commissioning and ongoing verification of dose delivery after any major upgrades to the MR-Linac hardware or software (i.e. perhaps once or twice a year). “It’s all about confidence and trust,” adds Mertens. “The water phantom will give the medical physicist peace of mind, ensuring that their MR/RT system is calibrated accurately for the verification of delivered dose to the patient.”

Beyond initial QA applications for MR/RT systems, LAP has released a version of the water phantom for the commissioning and QA of traditional bore-type linacs – specifically targeting clinical users of Varian’s Halcyon image-guided radiotherapy system and ETHOS, the vendor’s AI-enabled adaptive radiotherapy machine. “Alongside the original THALES 3D MR SCANNER,” concludes Mertens, “we have now launched the THALES 3D SCANNER. In the long term, this ‘two in one concept’ will allow more clinics and treatment centres to use the water phantom.”

What the customers say Workflow automation, intuitive software for data collection and analysis, plus minimal training overhead: these are just some of the recurring themes from LAP customers who have deployed the THALES 3D MR SCANNER over the past 12 months to support their MR/RT commissioning and machine QA efforts. For Thierry Gevaert, professor and head of medical physics at UZ Brussel (UZB), Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) in Belgium, and an early-adopter of the LAP THALES 3D MR SCANNER, the priorities when choosing a water phantom are ease of use, straightforward software to perform the measurements, and the ability to incorporate different types of ion chambers. “The reason for this is that our water phantom is only used extensively during commissioning and thereafter just a few times a year,” he explains. In this regard, it seems the LAP THALES 3D MR SCANNER ticks all the boxes for the commissioning and QA of UZB’s ViewRay MRIdian system. “With only one day of training, we were able to use the phantom’s software to rapidly perform all the necessary data collection,” adds Gevaert. “Moreover, being fully automated, we gained time during the commissioning testing procedure versus our traditional manual phantom.” That headline take is echoed by Randa El Gawhary, a medical physicist at San Pietro Hospital FBF in Rome, Italy, where the LAP THALES 3D MR SCANNER is also being used for the characterization and QA of the clinic’s ViewRay MRIdian system. “We have been impressed with the LAP phantom from the very beginning,” she explains. “It is a reliable QA system with high-quality electronics, while the software allows a very smooth workflow for fast and accurate measurements.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9573237895965576}",neutral,0.9573237895965576,0

This milestone paves the way for the commercialization of the technology, which could be used in a variety of new devices in the future that use iSIM to connect to cellular services. Compliant with the GSMA specification ieUICC, the iSIM embeds the SIM functionality in the device's main processor, enabling better system integration, higher performance and greater storage capacity. This technology is the latest advancement in SIM technology, where eSIMs (embedded SIM) are placed in devices. While a separate chip is required for the eSIM, this is no longer necessary with the iSIM, meaning that dedicated storage space is no longer required for the SIM services.

iSIM technology is a significant evolution of existing eSIM solutions and offers benefits to both consumers and telecom operators. It paves the way for the integration of mobile services into devices beyond mobile, bringing the mobile experience to laptops, tablets, virtual reality platforms, IoT devices, wearables and more. The iSIM is integrated into the application processor of the device, which brings numerous advantages:

Simplifies and improves device design and performance by freeing up previously occupied space within the deviceIntegrates the SIM functionality into the main chipset of the device alongside other important functions such as GPU, CPU and modemEnables remote SIM deployment by the operator using existing eSIM infrastructureEnables connection to mobile services for a variety of devices that previously did not have built-in SIM capabilities

The world's first Proof of Concept (POC) demonstration took place in Europe, one of the regions with the highest smartphone penetration in the world. The POC illustrates the commercial possibility and efficiency of the technology, which works on the existing eSIM infrastructure and uses Vodafone's network capacities. The demonstration used a fully functional proof-of-concept smartphone on the Vodafone network, based on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip3 5G powered by a Snapdragon®888 5G mobile chipset. It has an integrated Qualcomm® Secure Processing Unit running the Thales iSIM operating system for this demonstration. The proof of concept took place in Samsung's R&D labs and leveraged Vodafone's advanced eSIM remote management platform.

Alex Froment-Curtil, Chief Commercial Officer at Vodafone

Our goal is to create a world where all devices are connected seamlessly and easily and the customer is in full control. The iSIM in combination with our remote management platform is an important step in this direction. It enables devices to be connected without a physical SIM card or special chip and enables networking with many objects from the IoT world. This allows our customers to manage several accounts on one device, while from the operator's point of view there is no need for separate SIM cards and the associated additional plastic consumption.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999898672103882}",positive,0.9999898672103882,1
Intelsat orders two flexible GEO satellites for post-bankruptcy growth plan - SpaceNews,"Wed, 12 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9pbnRlbHNhdC1vcmRlcnMtdHdvLWZsZXhpYmxlLWdlby1zYXRlbGxpdGVzLWZvci1wb3N0LWJhbmtydXB0Y3ktZ3Jvd3RoLXBsYW4v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TAMPA, Fla. — Intelsat has ordered two software-defined satellites from Thales Alenia Space as the operator edges closer to emerging from bankruptcy.

The Intelsat 41 (IS-41) and Intelsat 44 (IS-44) satellites, scheduled to enter service in 2025, will be based on Thales Alenia Space’s Space Inspire platform.

They will join two other satellites that Intelsat ordered from Airbus in late 2020 for a new 5G-compatible network that can be reconfigured in-orbit. Based on Airbus’ OneSat platform, Intelsat 42 and Intelsat 43 are slated to launch in 2023.

IS-41 and IS-44 will provide commercial and government mobility services and cellular backhaul across Africa, Europe, the Middle East and Asia, Intelsat said in the Jan. 12 announcement.

“With the addition of Intelsat 41 and Intelsat 44, in partnership with Thales Alenia Space, Intelsat will blanket the earth with software-defined satellites, progressing the world’s first global 5G software-defined network, designed to unify the global telecoms ecosystem,” said Intelsat CEO Steve Spengler, who plans to leave the company after it exits bankruptcy.

Samer Halawi, who recently resigned as Intelsat’s executive vice president and chief commercial officer, told SpaceNews in October that it had issued a request for proposals (RFP) for 10 software-defined satellites in geostationary orbit.

They are part of a post-restructuring growth strategy that could include the operator’s own low Earth orbit constellation.

Intelsat has been operating under Chapter 11 protection since mid-May 2020, but reached a breakthrough Dec. 16, when the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia approved a restructuring plan to cut debt from $16 billion to $7 billion.

The approval put Intelsat on track to exit Chapter 11 in early 2022, once the company completes formalities that include fully securing the nearly $8 billion in financing that was committed in the restructuring plan.

Intelsat has eight other satellites under-construction in addition to the four software-defined satellites.

Maxar Technologies is building the Intelsat-40e (IS-40e) satellite that SpaceX is slated to launch this year for Intelsat’s high-throughput Epic fleet.

Intelsat has also ordered seven spacecraft to help clear C-band spectrum for terrestrial cellular 5G operators in the U.S. — five from Maxar and two from Northrop Grumman.

Intelsat recently said in a regulatory filing that it had received a $1.2 billion milestone payment from the Federal Communications Commission for clearing part of the spectrum.

The company said the proceeds could be used for capital expenditures (which would include satellite orders), reducing debt or other corporate purposes.

Rolling lab will gather data to enhance railway safety - Thales,"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi91bml0ZWQta2luZ2RvbS9uZXdzL3JvbGxpbmctbGFiLXdpbGwtZ2F0aGVyLWRhdGEtZW5oYW5jZS1yYWlsd2F5LXNhZmV0edIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Rolling lab will gather data to enhance railway safety transportation Share this article

A “rolling lab” on the UK railway network will provide critical data on a hyper-accurate train positioning system that aims to further increase the safety and efficiency of Britain’s railways.

This month (January 2022) Thales is installing its Robust Train Positioning System (RTPS) technology onboard an in-service GWR Class 150 cab, which marks the start of at least one year of data gathering in order to test the viability of the solution under realistic conditions.

The equipment is composed of a range of sensor systems, collating inputs from all sensors and combining them with a digital map of the track to provide an accurate and continuous positioning output. Through combining this system with existing Train Protection and Warning System (TPWS) technology, the train can be supervised against permitted movements and speeds and activate the emergency brake in the event of a “signal passed at danger” (SPAD) or excess speed incident.

The onboard system will not require trackside infrastructure, which makes it quicker, cheaper and safer to install and maintain than similar systems. The current TPWS protection works on powered grids at specific points of the track to stop the train if it approaches a red signal too quickly, or upon passing a red signal. The new system effectively “upgrades” TPWS and turns the entire track into a virtual continuous power grid. This will enhance safety trackside by allowing continuous communications and early warning of red signals and obstructions anywhere on the network, such as track maintenance and repairs.

Alex Stockill, Thales Product Line Manager, said: “We are fitting this equipment and connecting it to a general-purpose computer platform onboard, which will provide a range of potential benefits. It’s giving us a rolling lab for testing integration with TPWS, as well as many other opportunities for innovation.

“We have dozens of applications we want to investigate over the coming years to quickly test viability and conduct proof of concept demonstrations. Particularly usefully for this initial train is that we will be able to continuously generate and analyse data as it runs in passenger services, so it lets us test ideas at a low cost and high speed. It gives us a much quicker way of responding to customer needs and demonstrating solutions.

“We are aiming to get at least one of those ideas, once successfully tested and demonstrated, to market quicker as a new product so that it can potentially save lives and money for Network Rail.”

The trial is sponsored and supported by Network Rail and Great Western Railway, which has made one of its cabs available for the project. Contractors in Exeter began installing the equipment on the 17th of January and it will immediately start to gather data on return to normal passenger service. It will be in constant communication with Thales’s secure data centre in Cheadle, sending data for analysis.

The RTPS system will not be connected to the train’s control or communications systems during the trial, only drawing power from the cab, so that the driver will not be distracted.

However, Alex hopes that demonstration trials will be organised for Network Rail and other interested parties such as the Department for Transport and Train Operating Companies.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7785683274269104}",positive,0.7785683274269104,1
Thales in the UK to continue 100% High G service after contract extended - Thales,"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi91bml0ZWQta2luZ2RvbS9uZXdzL3RoYWxlcy11ay1jb250aW51ZS0xMDAtaGlnaC1nLXNlcnZpY2UtYWZ0ZXItY29udHJhY3QtZXh0ZW5kZWTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales in the UK to continue 100% High G service after contract extended Royal Air Force High G Share this article



LinkedIn

A 100% performance delivery record over the past three years, even during the Covid-19 pandemic, contributed to the MOD signing a three-year contract extension for Thales to continue supporting the Royal Air Force High G Test and Training facility.

At a ceremony on 30 November, Managing Director of Thales Training Solutions (TS) Daz Rawlins, and Stuart Lafferty, team leader for the Ministry of Defence Flight Simulation and Synthetic Training (FsAST) Project, met at the High G facility at RAF Cranwell to sign the contract for Thales training, engineering and administrative support until December 2024.

Also at the ceremony were the Officer Commanding the RAF Centre of Aviation Medicine, Group Commander Gwynne Harper, and Simon Meade, who recently took over from David Bolsover as Thales’s High G Training Support Manager.

Although the original intention was to put the contract to competitive tender, the Thales team’s performance over the past three years led to a change of mind at the MOD and the award of a non-competitive, single source service contract, which the MOD has the option to increase to four years.

David Bolsover, who has been involved with the project from build, said: “It’s great that we’re performing so well the customer wants us to carry on. The feedback from RAF CAM is that the service we provide is gold standard and they want the same service going forward.”

The £44m High G facility was completed in 2018 by Thales in the UK working with Austrian firm AMST and is used by Royal Navy and Royal Air Force pilots to simulate flight in aircraft including Hawk T2, Typhoon and F-35B Lightning. Pilots sitting in a realistic cockpit can learn to cope with up to 9G of force while using accurately recreated controls to carry out synthetic operations.

Whole Force teamwork in the face of a pandemic

Over the past three years, David has led a team of 10; three pilot instructors, four engineers, two survival equipment fitters and an administrator, effectively integrating with Service personnel.

“We’re very much part of the RAF’s Whole Force Concept,” said David. You can’t tell the difference between Thales staff and RAF. We have a high level of credibility when we talk with pilots and we’re seen as part of the team, which I think is the future.”

That teamwork was put to the test during the lockdown period when social distancing and working remotely were being encouraged. Maintaining 100% training delivery throughout was critical for the continuous defence of UK airspace by the Typhoon squadrons at Quick Reaction Alert.

“We needed to provide a flow of trained pilots into these squadrons,” said David, “So we had to keep going every day with no break, despite the lockdown. We carried out a risk assessment and minimised the number of staff on site, but five or six people had to be in every day to carry on training.”

There was no way to avoid staff contact with pilots, as they fastened pilots into the cockpit gondola at the end of a centrifuge arm, so special PPE was designed and new procedures developed to minimise contact.

Change with continuity

David recently handed the manager’s role to Simon: “Simon has been my deputy since the start of the project, so he’s best placed to take on the role as I step aside.”

Living near Cranwell, he hopes to devote more time to recreational flying and his vintage motorbikes and car.

However, he remains at the facility as a pilot instructor and expects to be busy with some outstanding projects, including recruiting a new instructor. He is also working on a bid to support the planned move by RAF CAM from RAF Henlow to a new facility at Cranwell. A bids shortlist will be announced in February.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997434020042419}",neutral,0.9997434020042419,0

The Guépard (“Cheetah”) is the military version of the H160 from Airbus Helicopters. It will be capable of performing up to 20 different mission types, including reconnaissance, fire support, special forces infiltration and command support for the 80 Guépards for the French Army; naval air combat, naval group protection and support, special forces operations and State action at sea for the 49 Guépards for the French Navy; and airspace surveillance and protection, search and rescue, fire support and intelligence for the 40 Guépards for the French Air and Space Force. The joint forces dimension of the programme will optimise crew training as well as equipment maintenance and repair.

The helicopter’s new cockpit will be equipped with the FlytX avionics suite, which features the most advanced technologies and an all-new ergonomic design. Co-developed with pilots over the last 10 years, the compact FlytX avionics suite for helicopters is fully connected and customisable to offer an unprecedented level of operational flexibility. Direct, intuitive touchscreen user interfaces improve the pilot’s interactions with the cockpit systems and enhance situational awareness so that aircrews can focus on their core mission tasks.

Rounding out the array of tools available to pilots, the TopOwl Digital Display, the latest addition to the Thales range of helmet-mounted sight and displays, heralds a new era of augmented reality in the cockpit. TopOwl combines sensor data and video feeds to enable pilots to fly the helicopter in a virtual environment in degraded conditions, and supports closer cooperation between crew-members to maximise operational capabilities.

Developed under joint funding by Thales and the DGA, the compact fixed-panel AirMaster C radar weighs less than20 kg for longer endurance and higher cruising speeds. Its ability to detect multiple targets simultaneously at long range and very short range reduces aircrew workload by providing an extended surveillance capability in all weather conditions and operational environments. AirMaster C is designed for all types of maritime, ground and air surveillance missions. The armed forces will rely on the radar’s scalable architecture and self-learning capabilities to classify and share huge volumes of operational data.

Crews will be protected by a defensive aids system optimised for the Guépard. This self-protection system will detect threats across the entire electromagnetic and optical spectrum and automatically initiate decoy launchers and other countermeasures. Self-protection strategies and protocols will be developed prior to deployment by groups of experts from the armed forces using an advanced mission planning and analysis infrastructure. A Thales architecture based on the CATS-150, which has been proven in operations on board the NH-90, was selected for its competitive and technical performance, its scalability and its capacity to handle sensitive electronic warfare data.

To meet the multi-mission requirements of all three branches of the armed forces, the Guépard will rely on an advanced connectivity suite providing a wide range of secure communications services. The suite will include the software-defined radio developed for the CONTACT programme, associated with a compact airborne encryption system, making it possible to integrate the helicopter with the cooperative systems developed under the SCORPION programme for the French land forces, interact with other aircraft deployed by the French Air and Space Force, and guarantee interoperability up to NATO Secret level. With the Micro-TMA resilient high-data-rate datalink, and interoperability with 4G/LTE networks, the joint light helicopter will pave the way for hyper-connected operational missions. The Guépard will also feature a radionavigation suite and a new, small form factor IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) system. In addition, the latest-generation TopStar M GPS/Galileo multi-constellation receiver will enhance the capabilities of the helicopter’s navigation system.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6270886063575745}",neutral,0.6270886063575745,0
IFC to benefit as Intelsat orders two more software-defined satellites - - Runway Girl Network,"Wed, 12 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjIvMDEvaW50ZWxzYXQtc29mdHdhcmUtZGVmaW5lZC1zYXRlbGxpdGVzLW5leHRnZW4tbmV0d29yay_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Making good on its stated commitment to invest in more software-defined GEO satellites to support its nextgen unified global 5G network strategy, Intelsat today announced it has tapped Thales Alenia Space to build two such satellites, operating in both Ku- and C-band frequencies.

Dubbed Intelsat 41 (IS-41) and Intelsat 44 (IS-44), the satellites are expected to be in service in 2025, helping to ensure the firm can add high-speed dynamically-allocated connectivity across Africa, Europe, the Middle East and Asia for government and commercial mobility services — including for the aviation market — as well as cellular backhaul.

“Intelsat 41 and Intelsat 44 will be based on the Thales Alenia Space’s innovative Space Inspire product line allowing seamless telecommunications mission and services reconfiguration, instant in-orbit adjustment to broadband connectivity demand, and superior video broadcasting performance while maximizing the effective use of the satellite resources,” said Intelsat in a statement.

Today’s deal means that Intelsat now has four software-defined satellites in production. Under a prior order with Airbus, the first two satellites (IS-42 and IS-43) for Intelsat’s nextgen network are on track to be delivered in 2023.

An Intelsat spokeswoman today confirmed to Runway Girl Network that IS-42 covers North America (including Central America and the Caribbean), as well as the North Atlantic. IS-43 covers North America and the North Pacific.

Intelsat previously revealed to RGN that it intends to operate roughly a dozen software-defined satellites to support a multi-orbit, multi-layer, multi-band network which will be integrated with terrestrial technologies and — specific to aero — will ensure an “everything-connected” airline passenger experience (PaxEx).

In terms of PaxEx, it explained: “This will deliver a flying experience that keeps customers focused on travel versus technology through seamless device roaming — allowing the passenger to easily move from the ground to aircraft A, to airport, then aircraft B, with an automatic connection every step of the journey. And it will result in improved economics for the airlines, matching bandwidth more closely with demand.”

With a fleet of over 50 satellites in geosynchronous orbit, Intelsat lays claim to operating “the world’s largest integrated satellite and terrestrial network”. The company also supports inflight connectivity on thousands of aircraft, after acquiring Gogo’s commercial aviation division at the end of 2020.

In aero, Intelsat’s 2Ku-branded inflight connectivity solution competes with IFC solutions from fellow Ku-band connectivity providers Panasonic Avionics and Anuvu. But Intelsat also supports their offerings with satellite capacity.

Additionally, Intelsat competes in aero with Ka-band-focused satellite operators Inmarsat and Viasat, which also connect aircraft around the world. Inmarsat, meanwhile, is planning a hybrid satcom/terrestrial global communications network of the future, called Orchestra.

On 8 November, 2021, Viasat revealed it had entered into a definitive agreement with Inmarsat to acquire the London-headquartered satellite operator for $7.3 billion. The move will create a global communications behemoth which — among its many assets — will boast a remarkable portfolio of inflight connectivity solutions and a significant customer base in civil aviation, posing intense competition to Intelsat in aviation.

Even though we don’t have the actual time each transaction took place, by looking at the distribution we can draw a few conclusions. The moments we see lower values are, probably, before dawn, when we would expect people not to go around shopping.

However, for the fraudulent transactions, we don’t observe the exact same pattern, as many transactions are actually registered at these periods of the day.

Preparing the dataset

Even though we don’t know the meaning of most of the data, the columns come on a variety of ranges, so the first step will be to adjust these ranges. For that, we’ll standardize the Time and Amount variables, as the rest of the properties have already been treated.

The next step will be to split our dataset between training and testing data, and in X (independent variables) and y (target classes). For this, the chosen test proportion was 20%, with the remaining 80% being assigned to the training set and the values were then randomly distributed.

We still have the imbalance issue to deal with, but we’ll deal with it later for comparison purposes.

Building our Random Forest Classifier

Image by author

The chosen Machine Learning model for this project was the Random Forest Classifier, from the Scikit-Learn Python library. Random Forests are an upgrade to the common Decision Trees we intuitively use on our everyday lives, when we try to make choices based on different characteristics and a series of true or false statements.

Decision Trees tend to create of series of rules and deal with the entire dataset at a time. Random Forests, however, add a pinch of (you guessed) randomness, by choosing different random features and entries for each of the many decision trees built, and then averaging out the results. This variability of the model theoretically creates more accurate predictions, as the many trees tend to attenuate the individual errors of each one of them.

However, how should we evaluate the performance of our model?

That is an extremely important question, and there isn’t an actual global conclusive answers. It always depends on the model and the characteristics of the data we’re working with.

For our specific case, where we have a set of highly imbalanced data and looking for a binary classification (valid or not), the most appropriate method would be the AUC-ROC (Area Under the Curve of the Receiver Operating Characteristics), a measure that deals with the True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR). You can read more about it here.

But, for a brief explanation, our AUC-ROC score will come as value between 0 and 1, where larger values mean that the model is better at correctly identifying the wanted classes. We’ll also use the prediction and recall parameters for comparison.

Training the raw data

The hyperparameters chosen were the standard values from the model (only setting a random_state for reproducibility), with a total of 100 estimators (decision trees).

After the fitting of the model to the training data, we proceeded to predict the classes on our testing data.

Image by Author

The first model, with the poorly treated data, returned a final score of 0.89, as a predictor with essentially a low false positive rate (precision of 0.92) and a mild false negative rate (recall of 0.78).

Due to the nature of the problem, my approach was to try and minimize the false negative rates, at the expense of eventually increasing the amount of false positive results. The hypothesis is that a preventive blockage (eventual social nuisance) is preferred over a fraudulent transaction passing through, which would cause issues like the necessity of a reimbursement.

Treating the imbalance issue

As we’ve seen, our raw dataset is highly imbalanced, and we have a few techniques to reduce this issue. These techniques can be classified as either oversampling or undersampling methods. In this analysis, we’ll use both, with the methods from the Imbalanced Learn Python library.

As the name suggests, each of these techniques either increases or decreases the number of observations on our dataset. We begin by oversampling with SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) for a target proportion of 1:10 (10% total), which essentially creates new entries for the smaller class (frauds), by generating property values that fit within the original observations.

For undersampling, we’ll use the Random Under Sampler method for a proportion of 5:10 (double of the minority class), which randomly picks out some of the largest class (valid) entries and erases them from the dataset.

Image by Author

With this, we now have a third of the whole set as frauds. The important thing to point out is that only the training set went through this transformation. We want to keep the testing data as real as it gets, in order to properly evaluate our model.

Below we can see a side-by-side comparison of the distribution before and after treating the imbalance.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999936819076538}",neutral,0.9999936819076538,0

Sanjay Bhandari , an accused arms dealer wanted in India on money laundering and tax evasion charges, is pursuing a separate legal battle of his own in France over an alleged unpaid cut from a large Indian defence contract dating back over 10 years, according to a UK media report.Bhandari, 59, has filed a case against French defence major Thales Group demanding he be paid his full “consultancy fee” of EURO 20 million for his role as an intermediary in winning the company an estimated EURO 2.4 billion contract to modernise the Mirage 2000 fleet of fighter jets for the Indian Air Force (IAF), ‘The Daily Telegraph’ newspaper reported this week.Thales firmly denies any such agreement or contract with the Indian businessman, who describes himself as a “well-known commercial intermediary involved in arms and defence in India” in court papers filed at the Tribunal de Commerce in Nanterre, near Paris, seen by the newspaper.Bhandari, who is currently on conditional bail in Britain ahead of an extradition hearing expected to begin in London on February 21, is also said to have applied for political asylum claiming persecution by the BJP-led government due to his links to the Opposition Congress Party.The case comes at a time when Thales, as part of a French consortium, are negotiating with the Indian government to sell more Rafale military jets, with a deal for the supply of 36 Rafale-B and Rafale-C jets for the IAF nearing completion.According to the newspaper report, Bhandari alleges that from 2008 he helped Thales sell the upgrade of the Mirage jets by facilitating a meeting with an Indian defence ministry official.He claims to have helped the company clinch the deal to modernise the Mirage 2000 fleet of fighter jets that India had bought from France in 1982 but was paid only EURO 9 million of the EURO 20 million agreed.In court papers, Bhandari claims he had “a longstanding commercial relationship” with Thales since 1996 and helped set up a key meeting in Paris following which in July 2011 Thales and Dassault won the Indian government contract.In his petition, Bhandari claims that he was told by a Thales India official about an elaborate financial covert scheme in India and Dubai which enabled the payment of secret commissions to intermediaries. This arrangement was presented as being a standard practice within the Thales group for the payment of commercial intermediation services, taking into account the regulations in force in France, the claim reads.The petition also alleges that in order to pay the commissions to Bhandari, Thales awarded offset contracts to two companies based in Bangalore. “The companies would retain about 25 per cent of the price paid by Thales for services that could materialise in engineering or consulting,” says the newspaper report.A spokesperson for Thales confirmed that Bhandari had filed a petition against Thales SA in a commercial court in June last year for the settlement of sums “allegedly due to him on an aeronautical modernisation project”.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999107122421265}",neutral,0.9999107122421265,0

The company has denied any wrongdoing.

Bhandari is wanted in India on charges of tax evasion and money laundering and is fighting extradition requests by New Delhi. Bhandari had fled to the UK in 2016 and is seeking asylum there. His extradition trial is expected to start in February.

The UK's The Telegraph reported recently that Bhandari had filed a lawsuit against Thales at a commercial court near Paris. Bhandari claimed he was hired by Thales to secure a Euro 2.4 billion contract to upgrade India's fleet of Mirage 2000 fighters, which was signed in 2011. The Telegraph reported “Bhandari is asking the court to order Thales to pay him commissions that he says he is owed. The lawsuit is ongoing and a judgement is expected later this year.”

Bhandari alleged that from 2008, he had helped Thales in securing the deal to upgrade the Mirage 2000 fighters by facilitating a meeting with an Indian defence official.

“He claims that he was due a consultancy fee of €20m but was only paid €9m,” The Telegraph reported.

Bhandari claimed Thales had paid him via “an elaborate financial covert scheme in India and Dubai which enabled the payment of secret commissions to intermediaries”.

Bhandari claimed the BJP-led government was targeting him for his links to the Congress party. A spokesperson for Thales told The Times of India, “Mr Bhandari filed a petition against Thales SA in a commercial court in June 2021 for the settlement of sums allegedly due to him on an aeronautical modernisation project. Thales firmly denies the claims by Mr Sanjay Bhandari regarding the sums allegedly due or any other payments to him by Thales SA. Thales has never signed a contract with Mr Bhandari or his companies in connection with this project. Thales complies with the law and applies a zero tolerance policy on corruption and influence peddling. The group’s integrity programme is regularly evaluated and amended to reflect changes in applicable legislation and best practices.”

The Telegraph report noted the allegations could embarrass the French government as it attempts to sell more Rafale jets to the Indian Air Force and also secure an Indian Navy contract.

The new development will deliver an advanced manufacturing 4.0 and integration hub for the precision manufacture of next generation Australian designed weapon systems, according to the company.

It will integrate traditional precision manufacturing and digital technologies, including 3D printing, and the installation of automated electro-plating and other metal treatment capabilities.

The new development will also include a new purpose-built live firing test and evaluation capability to support systems qualification and integration, and the acceleration of research and technology development of digitised small-arms and weapon system platforms.

Late last year, Thales Australia announced over $12 million of investments in new infrastructure and advanced manufacturing capability at the company’s Lithgow and Mulwala facilities, supporting the Governments’ sovereign munitions and small arms research, design, development and manufacture priority.

The new development at Lithgow will expand precision-manufacturing capability of Lithgow Arms to support new sovereign manufacturing partnerships for strategic ADF programs, including the company’s partnership with Rheinmetall Defence Australia to manufacture key components for Rheinmetall in support of the Australian Defence Force Land 400 program of armoured fighting vehicles.

The purpose-built facility will also support collaboration across research institutions, SME partners, and key industrial partners to create the soldier systems and small arms of the future, as well as train the next generation of skilled advanced manufacturing workers in the central west.

The Lithgow Small Arms Factory opened on 8 June 1912, initially manufacturing SMLE III rifles and Pattern 1907 bayonets for the Australian military during World War I.

The iSIM, which complies with GSMA specifications, embeds the SIM functionality into the device's main processor, allowing for greater system integration, higher performance, and increased memory capacity, the company claims.

""Some of the areas that will benefit most from iSIM technology include smartphones, mobile PCs, VR/XR headsets, and industrial IoT. By engineering the iSIM technology into the SoC, we are able to create additional support for OEMs in our Snapdragon platform,"" Enrico Salvatori, Senior Vice President and President, Europe/MEA, Qualcomm Europe, said in a statement.

This technology is the latest evolution of SIM technology in which 'eSIMs' are embedded into devices. However, eSIM requires a separate chip: with iSIM, this is no longer necessary and removes the need for dedicated space assigned to SIM services.

""The iSIM, combined with our remote management platform, is a major step in this direction, allowing devices to be connected without a physical SIM or dedicated chip, making connectivity to many objects - the promise of the connected IoT world - a reality,"" Alex Froment-Curtil, Chief Commercial Officer, Vodafone added.

iSIM technology is a significant evolution on existing eSIM solutions and delivers wholesale benefits to both consumers and telecommunications operators, further paving the way for mobile services to be integrated into devices beyond the mobile phone, taking the mobile experience to laptops, tablets virtual reality platforms, IoT devices, wearables, and more.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999514818191528}",positive,0.9999514818191528,1
UNSW Canberra graduate emerges as young engineering talent at Thales Australia - UNSW Sydney,"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuc3cuZWR1LmF1L25ld3MvMjAyMi8wMS91bnN3LWNhbmJlcnJhLWdyYWR1YXRlLWVtZXJnZXMtYXMteW91bmctZW5naW5lZXJpbmctdGFsZW50LWF0LXRo0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Just four years into her engineering career, UNSW Canberra graduate and current PhD student Michelle Norton is already making her mark.

Michelle’s work on the upgrade of the Captain Cook Graving Dock (CCGD) has earned her the 2021 Thales Emerging Talent Award.

The award recognises individuals at the beginning of their professional life who have shown a clear commitment to developing a career in the industry.

Michelle began with Thales in 2018 after completing her mechanical engineering degree at UNSW Canberra.

“Some of the more interesting and complex tasks I have worked on with Thales have been around major upgrade and support works for the CCGD,” Michelle said.

“The dry dock was built during World War II, is now over 76 years old and is the largest dry dock in the southern hemisphere. As you can probably imagine any adjustments to a system this old, pre-dating standards can become complex when bringing each sub system or component in line with contemporary standards.”

She described winning the Emerging Talent Award as an “unexpected surprise”, given the calibre of the nominations.

“Throughout the process of being nominated and selected as a finalist, I’ve seen how much my colleagues and friends support me,” Michelle said.

“Being recognised for my contributions I have worked on, as well as the STEM outreach I have been doing is a great honour.”

Michelle Norton presents at the World Engineering Convention.

In addition to her work with Thales, Michelle is passionate about inspiring young people to consider a career in STEM. During the latest lockdown in Sydney, she handed out more than 300 fun science and engineering activity kits for children in her neighbourhood.

She has also returned to UNSW Canberra to complete a PhD project inspired by her work on the dry dock.

“I am looking into the fluid structure interaction of two-phase flow around partially opened gate valves,” Michelle said.

“The direct application of this work is the flooding inlet valves for the CCGD. I am looking at the relative significance of a range of parameters both internal to the valve and external system factors and their impact to flow induced vibrations on the valve gate. I hope to develop a monitoring scheme to predict failure of large in-service valves.”

Her advice to other recent graduates looking to continue their studies part time is “go for it”.

“Balancing work demands can be a bit challenging, but it has been worth it for me. It is a great way to keep your technical skills up while you have a period of time where work isn’t requiring you to use these skills,” she said.

We wish Michelle well on the next phase of her career, which includes transitioning into a new role with Thales Australia in the Guided Weapons, Space and Hypersonics Team.

A Dubai-based company has emerged as a common link between a €2.4 billion 2011 deal to upgrade Indian Air Force's Mirage fighter jets in 2011 and another Rs 3,600-cr pact in 2009 for acquiring helicopters from UK's AgustaWestland for transporting VVIPs.In a suit filed at a commercial court near Paris , defence middleman Sanjay Bhandari has reportedly claimed that French arms company Thales had hired him to help secure the deal to upgrade India's Mirage 2000 fighters. The deal was inked between the Indian and French governments in 2011.According to UK newspaper the Telegraph, Bhandari claimed that he was promised a consultancy fee/commission of e20 million, but was paid only e9 million.Bhandari, who claims to have sought political asylum in Britain, has further alleged that he was paid by Thales via an ""elaborate financial covert scheme"" in India and Dubai which enabled the payment of secret commissions to intermediaries. A part of the e9 million was paid to him through a Dubai-based company, UHY Saxena, he has claimed.Thales has denied the charges levelled by Bhandari. A statement issued by its spokesperson said the company has never signed a contract with Bhandari or his companies in connection with this project.The Dubai-based company, UHY Saxena, is being investigated by Indian agencies for allegedly laundering kickbacks to influential people for swinging the VVIP helicopter deal in favour of AgustaWestland.According to submissions by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate (ED), the company was operated by ""hawala operator"" Rajiv Saxena, who was deported from Dubai to India in January 2019.The CBI has filed a charge sheet against Saxena in December 2020, accusing him of corruption and conspiracy. He was turned from an accused to an approver by the ED in March 2019, but months later, the agency moved a court seeking revocation of his approver status. The matter is pending in the Supreme Court.The ED has alleged that Saxena in ""connivance with"" co-accused and lawyer Gautam Khaitan, provided a ""corporate structure across the globe for laundering operation"" and played an active role in laundering the proceeds of crime. He incorporated several companies in the UAE through his holding company, UHY Saxena, the ED has claimed.During his questioning by the ED, the agency had recovered the consultancy agreement between Thales and UHY Saxena. The agency had sought a list of all clients of UHY Saxena.The agencies in their latest report last December informed a special CBI court that a summons was sent to UHY Saxena through the Ministry of Home Affairs and its response was still awaited.Meanwhile, Saxena has claimed that he has nothing to do with the company, which has gone into liquidation.Meanwhile, the Indian government has already commenced extradition proceedings to bring back Bhandari, an alleged associate of Robert Vadra, son-in-law of Congress president Sonia Gandhi.Vadra has denied any business association with Bhandari.Bhandari was also booked by the CBI in another deal which the agency believes would give impetus to their probe into suspected 'benami properties' purchased in London allegedly for Vadra.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996637105941772}",neutral,0.9996637105941772,0
Globe debuts first ever Eco-SIM in Asia - PR Newswire APAC - PR Newswire Asia,"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZW4ucHJuYXNpYS5jb20vcmVsZWFzZXMvYXBhYy9nbG9iZS1kZWJ1dHMtZmlyc3QtZXZlci1lY28tc2ltLWluLWFzaWEtMzQ5NDk1LnNodG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TAGUIG, Philippines, Jan. 24, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- As the country's leader in mobile, Globe debuts the first-ever Eco-SIM cards in Asia for its postpaid mobile customers, contributing to environmental sustainability by recycling refrigerator waste, in time for Zero Waste Month in January.

SIM cards are among the smallest consumer items in the world, weighing around 4 grams each.

However, with approximately 4.5 billion SIM cards manufactured every year[1], their combined weight represents an estimated 20,000 tons of plastic and other polymers, or the equivalent weight of 4000 jeepneys.

Together with its partner, Thales, Globe has deployed Eco-SIM cards starting November 2021, made from 100% recycled materials including polystyrene waste from refrigerators, diverting this waste stream from landfills.

Thales is a global leader in advanced technologies, investing in digital and ""deep tech"" innovations. Thales has been in the Philippines since 2010, and is a strategic partner to key customers in the civil aviation, defense, digital security, air traffic management, and ground transportation sectors.

Thales' Eco-SIM Card[2] was first developed in 2020 in partnership with Veolia and has a neutral carbon footprint. Made from 100% recycled polystyrene recovered from discarded refrigerator interiors, the CO2 emissions from the manufacturing process and electronic components are fully offset by Thales' comprehensive carbon offset program.

In addition to offering a second life to refrigerator interiors and enabling an independent and exclusive green plastic supply flow to Globe for their SIM cards, Thales is helping Globe meet its ambitions for cutting e-waste, reducing its carbon footprint and contributing to sustainability in the Philippines.

""As consumers become more environmentally-conscious, the onus is on companies to innovate to introduce sustainable technology solutions to remain competitive. As a Group, Thales has pledged to get to net zero carbon emissions by 2040, and we align with the ambitions of many organizations to work for the better good and build a sustainable future. The Eco-SIM card is small, but it has a big impact on plastic and polymer waste and is another example of how we innovate to drive change. We are excited to partner with Globe on this pioneering initiative in the Philippines with a goal to roll it out throughout Asia,"" said Jon Cahilig, Head of Mobile Connectivity Solutions for Asia, Thales Digital Identity & Security.

In 2019, Globe became a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, committing to implement universal sustainability principles on human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption in its operations. In January 2021, Globe formally expressed its support to the globally-recognized Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) in January. Along with more than 1,800 companies worldwide, Globe supports the framework set by TCFD and is committed to following recommendations towards effective climate-related disclosures.

To further this commitment in 2021, Globe became the first publicly-listed Philippine company to be listed by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) committed to set science-based targets, in line with the 1.5°C global warming scenario of the Paris Agreement and the #RacetoZero Campaign. These commitments cover both the mid-term (2030) and long-term (2050) targets.

""In order for us to truly move the needle in the fight against climate change, we all must take on the responsibility to act sustainably. This partnership with the Thales Group not only enables us to come up with a solution for our telco business, but it also gives our customers the opportunity to step up and choose to live more sustainably,"" said Yoly Crisanto, Globe's Chief Sustainability Officer and SVP for Corporate Communications.

In 2018, Globe was also the first in the country to introduce electronic SIMs or eSIM, as another alternative to the physical SIM cards. eSIMs are digital SIMs embedded in compatible mobile phone models, allowing its users to manage multiple profiles using different mobile numbers on just one device and effortlessly switch lines that fit their purpose. It also allows gadgets like smartphones and smartwatches to be connected under one mobile number.

Globe strongly supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, particularly UN SDG No. 12, which highlights the roles of responsible consumption and production patterns as crucial steps toward building a circular economy. Globe is committed to upholding the 10 United Nations Global Compact principles and 10 UN SDGs.

Built upon the foundation of embedded SIM (eSIM), iSIM allows the mobile industry to further integrate SIM’s functionalities into a phone without the need for the traditional physical SIM card.

While eSIM requires a separate chip to be installed, iSIM is implemented directly into the phone’s main processor which leads to better performance, increased memory capacity, and improved space utilisation according to Qualcomm. The ultimate vision of the iSIM is to have SIM’s functionalities across all types of consumer products, including laptops, VR headsets, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.

Back in August, Qualcomm announced the inclusion of iSIM technology in its Snapdragon 888 5G chipset. More recently, Qualcomm, Vodafone, and Thales demonstrated a proof-of-concept in Samsung’s R&D labs in Europe using a Samsung Galaxy Z Flip3 5G powered by a Snapdragon 888, which ran on Vodafone’s network and Thales’ iSIM operating system.

The iSIM technology has been in the works for a while now since it was first announced by Arm back in 2018 and Vodafone itself jumped into the foray within the same year. Other companies that are already looking into the iSIM include Sony, which recently worked with Kigen and floLIVE to develop iSIM integration into Sony’s Altair ALT1250 IoT chipset, while Nokia launched its own cloud-based iSIM management platform called Secure Connect.

While the demonstration can be seen as an early sign that iSIM may finally be ready for mass users, neither Qualcomm, Vodafone, nor Thales have provided a timeframe for when exactly consumers can expect iSIM-enabled devices to be available in the market.

Bhandari, who is wanted in India under the Officials Secrets Act, is currently in the UK, where he has sought asylum.

New Delhi: Fugitive arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari has sued French firm Thales over €11m (Rs 92 crore) as “commissions” that he claims is owed to him in connection with a defence deal inked in India a decade ago, according to a report published in the United Kingdom Monday.

The French firm, which is also part of the 2016 deal India signed for the delivery of 36 Rafale jets, is “facing allegations that it used a secret and illicit system of paying middlemen to secure lucrative international contracts”, said a report by the UK-based newspaper, The Telegraph.

Citing court documents, The Telegraph reported that Bhandari alleges he “helped” Thales to “sell the upgrade of the Mirage jets by facilitating a meeting” with a senior defence ministry official. Moreover, he claims that he was due a consultancy fee of “€20m but was only paid €9m”.

Bhandari has described himself in the lawsuit as a “well-known commercial intermediary involved in arms and defence in India”, who has “worked with major international defence companies to assist them in negotiating arms contracts with the Indian Ministry of Defence”. The lawsuit is ongoing and a judgment is expected later this year.

In a statement to ThePrint, the French firm said Bhandari filed a petition against Thales SA in a commercial court in June 2021 for the settlement of sums allegedly due to him on an aeronautical modernisation project.

“Thales firmly denies the claims by Mr Sanjay Bhandari regarding the sums allegedly due or any other payments to him by Thales SA. Thales has never signed a contract with Mr Bhandari or his companies in connection with this project,” it said.

“Thales complies with the law and applies a zero tolerance policy on corruption and influence peddling. The group’s integrity programme is regularly evaluated and amended to reflect changes in applicable legislation and best practices,” it added.

Who is Bhandari?

Sanjay Bhandari, considered close to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s brother-in-law Robert Vadra, had fled India in 2016 following raids at his residence for allegedly possessing classified information on the country’s defence purchases. He was later charged under the Official Secrets Act.

While initially security agencies believed that the elusive arms dealer had gone into “hiding”, ThePrint had in 2018 traced him to an upscale property close to the famous Berkeley Square in London.

India has moved the UK for his extradition for money laundering and tax evasion cases against him. A hearing in the case is due in London next month. Bhandari is currently on conditional bail in the UK awaiting outcome of his extradition case.

The Mirage upgrade

The Mirage 2000 upgrade programme is delayed and has missed its original 2021-end deadline.

The upgrade of the aircraft, bought between 1982 and 1985, aimed at giving it better firepower, new sensors, latest electronic warfare systems and a life-extension.

The IAF had last year signed a contract worth about Rs 300 crore with a French private firm for the purchase of phased-out Mirage 2000 aircraft to be used as ‘Christmas trees’ for spares.

The arms deal trial was initially set to resume on 11 April 2022.

Former president Jacob Zuma’s arms deal trial continues next week as the application for leave to appeal will be heard in the High Court.

The former statesman and Thales are on trial over the controversial multibillion-rand arms deal struck when Zuma was KZN’s MEC for Economic Development, in the 1990s.

Zuma faces 18 charges and 783 counts of fraud‚ corruption, money laundering, and racketeering – while Thales is facing four counts.

Back in May 2021, Zuma signed his affidavit arguing for the National Prosecuting Authority’s (NPA’s) advocate Billy Downer’s recusal from the arms deal trial.

Zuma claimed prosecutors were conspiring against him and the case postponed to give Zuma’s legal team an extension to file an affidavit outlining their reasons for demanding Downer’s withdrawal.

The application was presented before Judge Piet Koen in July 2021, with Zuma losing the special-plea bid to have Downer recused in October.

At the time, Judge Koen dismissed the 14 grounds raised by Zuma’s legal team as they were based on speculation and ordered that the corruption trial proceed.

Judge Koen found that Zuma’s demand for acquittal in terms of section 106(1)(h) Criminal Procedure Act was incorrect.

“The ultimate question to be answered is therefore not whether the prosecutor is not independent or not impartial or biased or not sufficiently independent or impartial, but whether the accused will ultimately receive a fair trial”.

The arms deal trial – which has dragged on for nearly two decades – was initially set to resume on 11 April 2022.

The Judiciary, however, on Monday confirmed the case will continue at the KwaZulu-Natal division of the High Court on 31 January 2022.

Back in 2021, the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) also upheld a previous High Court ruling that Zuma was liable to pay his own legal fees.

In its judgment, the SCA put the total figure so far at around R25 million.
