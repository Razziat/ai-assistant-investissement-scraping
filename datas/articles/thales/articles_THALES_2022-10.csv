If you could ask the head of Human Resources at Thales anything you like, what would it be? That's the exercise we set a group of young graduates thinking about applying for a job with Thales. Clément de Villepin was happy to oblige, talking about competitive pay, diversity and the quest for meaning – and without dodging any of the tricky questions.

© Eric Malemanche

Jeremy: I received a job offer from one of the US tech giants. What would convince me to come and work for Thales instead?

Clément de Villepin:

I understand your dilemma. In both cases, you would be joining a major international tech company. In both cases, you would be part of a very agile, very digital organisation, and you would be working alongside some of the world's leading experts in their respective fields.

To understand Thales, you have to understand what we're doing today and how that has been affected by decades of innovation. The Group's engineers and researchers are working in ""socially sensitive"" areas such as air mobility, space, urban and national security, and now cybersecurity, data protection and the fight against global warning. That's why we have always questioned ourselves about the impact of our technologies and what our work means for society.

Thales employees are constantly searching for answers. They want to understand the real impact of their work and its bearing on society, the environment and the day-to-day lives of millions of citizens. That soul-searching has always been part of our DNA, because the systems we develop have always had a palpable influence on the way the world works.

When your activities have a direct impact on issues such as national sovereignty, digital inclusion, space exploration, connectivity, mobility, personal safety and data security, you have a duty to look for answers to these questions and to uphold certain ethical values. It's something that really sets us apart from other organisations.

Another point – probably connected to the first one – is that our corporate culture is all about enabling employees to find a balance in their lives that will support their long-term success.

And also, again because of the type of work we do and the range of markets we serve, we can offer them the opportunity to work on a wide variety of projects that will have a lasting effect on the world.

We have always questioned ourselves about the impact of our technologies and what our work means for society.

Gabriel: On the other hand, wouldn't a tech giant pay better?

Clément de Villepin:

Compensation is a key part of what makes a company attractive. We need to be competitive and we try to offer salaries that are high enough to attract the best talent. Above all we at Thales provide opportunities for employees to take part in projects with a high level of scientific and technical complexity, a chance to build compelling career paths within the organisation and to find a sense of meaning in their work. We want people to come to work at Thales at least as much for those reasons as for the pay. We believe that's how they will grow and flourish within the company over the long term.

Karima: Aren't career paths at Thales a bit linear? Wouldn't I end up always doing the same thing?

Clément de Villepin:

I really don't believe that's the case, I can assure you. You can easily spend your whole career at Thales without ever getting bored!

To begin with, we have an extremely diverse spectrum of businesses. You could start in aerospace, for example, and then move into another field such as defence, space exploration or digital security. We go out of our way to help our people move from one universe to another, because we firmly believe that mobility and the career journeys we offer promote diversity and are ultimately beneficial to both our employees and the Group.

Our HR team actively encourages geographic, operational and job mobility in a number of ways. Last year, for example, more than 70,000 employees sat down with their managers as part of our annual cycle of professional development discussions. They had a chance to review their skills and abilities, talk about their future aspirations and decide together about training or career development opportunities.

More broadly, we see Thales as a learning organisation where you will be able to discover different ways of working, expand your skill sets through training and be part of communities of internationally recognised experts working in completely different fields.

Louise: Thales is often talking about ""human intelligence"". What do you mean by that?

Clément de Villepin:

When we talk about human intelligence, the point we're trying to make is that we can only achieve big ambitions by putting humans at the heart of everything we do. We mean that the men and women of Thales our biggest asset, and that it's thanks to their human intelligence that we can develop the innovations that have built our reputation and our success.

If Thales engineers and researchers manage to develop some of the world's most advanced technologies, it's in large part because they feel fulfilled. They have a passion for what they do, a good work-life balance and the chance to share their ideas and perspectives with colleagues from all over the world. So for Thales, the emphasis on human intelligence is about wanting to provide the best possible ""employee experience"", for example by offering professional growth and development opportunities, a good work-life balance and a chance for individuals to broaden their perspectives.

In terms of ethics, the focus on human intelligence also serves as a reminder that technology cannot be a substitute for the men and women who use it. This is one of the basic tenets of our Digital Ethics Charter, for example, in which we pledge to ensure that our artificial intelligence systems will always be designed to support human decision-making and not to replace it.

Antoine: I want a family life and a chance to play sport and develop personal projects. How does Thales ensure a good work-life balance?

Clément de Villepin:

You're not the only one to expect all that! As the head of HR for a major company, I also need to spend time with my children, read books and go to exhibitions. It's in the Group's best interests to make sure employees have a good work-life balance, quite simply because it makes us more productive and enables us to thrive in our professional lives over the long term. Thales has nothing to gain by not respecting that balance – it's just not our way of doing things.

Jian: Do you offer international opportunities?

Clément de Villepin:

Absolutely. Thales is an international group with operations in 68 countries and more than 70% of its sales outside France. When you join Thales, you very quickly have to interact with colleagues in other countries around the world. I would even say the ability to work in a multi-cultural environment is an essential skill for Thales employees. And of course a global organisation like Thales offers a whole range of opportunities to work in different countries and regions, whether it be for short periods or for several years at a time.

Rebecca: I'm not sure I want to work for a company that's involved in the defence industry. Doesn't it bother you?

Clément de Villepin:

Naturally I respect everyone's right to say no to defence. At Thales, we strongly believe that designing equipment and solutions for the armed forces helps societies to develop more sustainably. The war in Ukraine is yet another reminder of the need to protect our democracies. Sustainable peace cannot be achieved without stability, and to achieve stability we need to be able to defend ourselves.

Having said that, civil markets account for a large proportion of our business (cybersecurity, aerospace, space, digital identity, etc.), and we open our arms to people of all beliefs and backgrounds. This diversity of opinion is an important asset for a company like ours – it's what drives the conversation internally and keeps us on our toes.

Joshua: What is Thales doing with respect to climate change?

Clément de Villepin:

At Thales, we use our experience and expertise to help to make the world safer, greener and more inclusive. That's what drives us forward and gives our professional lives a sense of meaning and purpose. With respect to climate change, we are basically working on two fronts.

First, we know for a fact that science and technology are going to be part of the planet's response to climate change. Thales is one of the companies that makes the biggest contribution to scientific progress in the world. In fact, Nature magazine has ranked us in the global top 30 companies for advanced research. And we recently stepped up our ""clean tech"" development strategy, because we believe we have a responsibility to draw on our potential for innovation to help create a more sustainable planet.

By joining Thales, you will have the chance to help build systems that are more ""energy sufficient"" – in other words systems that consume just the amount of energy they need, and no more. You could be designing satellites that will bring us a better understanding of environmental phenomena, or applying the principles of eco-design to any and all of our products and solutions.

And second, we are steadily reducing our own CO2 emissions and plan to achieve net zero by 2040.

If you are really concerned about environmental causes and want to change things in the right direction, Thales will be the ideal place for you to work. Environmental responsibility is one of the three pillars of our CSR policy, alongside workplace safety and inclusion.

Adriana: What concrete steps are you taking to promote diversity within the Group?

Clément de Villepin:

We know we need to attract people with a variety of different profiles. Diversity boosts our creativity and our potential for innovation because it lets us tackle issues from multiple perspectives and points of view – and because it's the best way to meet the needs of our customers. At the end of the day, diversity is a key driver of performance both for Thales and for our customers.

Whether we're talking about promoting equal opportunities, gender parity, LGBT+ employees or people with disabilities, we have proactive HR policies in place to achieve greater diversity in the Thales workforce. Of course, we still have a long way to go, but we're determined to get there!

For the employment of people with disabilities in France, for example, we have appointed an advisor at each Thales site to support the employees in question, who account for 6% of our workforce today. That makes Thales one of the best-performing companies in Europe on this issue.

Alexandre: If you had to sum up a career at Thales in three key words or ideas, what would they be?

Clément de Villepin:

A passion for technology, collective engagement, and meaning.

"Nexter, Thales RapidFire turret to help French Navy fight drone swarms - C4ISRNET","Tue, 18 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmM0aXNybmV0LmNvbS91bm1hbm5lZC8yMDIyLzEwLzE4L25leHRlci10aGFsZXMtcmFwaWRmaXJlLXR1cnJldC10by1oZWxwLWZyZW5jaC1uYXZ5LWZpZ2h0LWRyb25lLXN3YXJtcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Nexter Systems and Thales have released the final design for a new 40 mm naval air defense system, expecting deliveries to the French Navy to begin in the next few months.

The companies presented an at-scale mockup of the final design for their RapidFire system at the Nexter booth during the biennial Euronaval trade conference, taking place here Oct. 18-21.

The gun system has been in development since 2019, Olivier Lequeux, Nexter’s turret market director, told reporters Tuesday on the show floor. Developed for the French Navy, the RapidFire is designed for low-layer ground-to-air defense – particularly anti-drone warfare – and can protect ships, land units, or bases against a wide range of threats such as jet skis, boats, loitering ammunition, swarms of unmanned aerial systems (UAVs), light aircraft or missiles up to 4,000 meters away.

The gun system is based on the 40CTA (40 mm Cased Telescoped Ammunition) cannon co-developed 25 years ago by Nexter and BAE Systems under the joint venture CTAI. The cannon is in use on the EBRC Jaguar armored reconnaissance vehicle, developed for the French and Belgian armies, and will also be installed on the Ajax armored fighting vehicles in development by General Dynamics for the British Army.

The initial program of record is to deliver four RapidFires to the French Navy, which will equip its new tanker vessels – known in French as batiments ravitailleurs de force, or BRF – with two systems each. The first system is scheduled to be delivered in late 2022 or early 2023, Lequeux said. The first two systems are currently undergoing testing and evaluations.

The companies expect to ultimately deliver over 40 systems to the navy, to equip other vessels including the service’s ocean patrol vessels, and future mine warfare vessels. The RapidFire could also serve as secondary artillery for France’s first-rank frigates and carriers, said Norbert Cadapeaud, product line manager at Thales Land and Air Systems.

Thales and Nexter developed a road map for the air defense system over a decade ago, when the two companies began to identify the need to detect and track very small and very fast targets, Lequeux said.

“To have the capacity to engage a swarm of drones is completely new for this type of system, and for us it was very important,” he said.

Incorporating a panoramic sight on the turret was also critical, as was the development of new ammunition – the Anti-Aerial Airburst (A3B) round dedicated against air targets. Nexter is currently undergoing two years of internal qualifications with the A3B round, which must then be tested and qualified by France’s military procurement office, the Delegation Generale de l’Armement.

The RapidFire will be equipped with five different types of ammunition, including the A3B. The ammunition can be automatically identified and selected to counter the designated threat, Cadapeaud noted. The optronic sight is capable of operating independently from the gun or connected to the command management system, and the turret operates passively when not in firing mode, he added.

The companies’ roadmap includes adding guided munitions to the turret, per Nexter’s Lequeux.

The RapidFire includes some adaptations from its land-based variant, such as to account for the different munition weights, he added. But the land and naval versions will be assembled on the same production line, with modifications occurring only at the very end of the process.

Nexter is on contract to deliver 40 CTA cannons under the French army’s Scorpion modernization program for the next four decades, meaning the RapidFire can be produced for equally as long, Lequeux noted.

Thales and Nexter expect a number of export opportunities for the RapidFire as well, but declined to offer specifics.

Workers in a clean room in Cannes, France, load the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite into a container in preparation for shipping the spacecraft to the U.S. SWOT is an international mission led by NASA and the French space agency Centre National d'Études Spatiales (CNES) that will survey water on more than 90&percnt of Earth's surface.

The spacecraft will view water in Earth's lakes, rivers, reservoirs, and the ocean in higher definition than ever before. The information that SWOT gathers will help inform water management decisions and prepare communities for rising seas and changing coastlines. It will also help researchers better understand the exchange of heat and carbon between the ocean and atmosphere, an important component of the role that Earth's ocean plays in the planet's climate.

SWOT will launch out of the Vandenberg Space Force Base in central California no earlier than Dec. 5, 2022.

SWOT is being jointly developed by NASA and CNES, with contributions from the Canadian Space Agency and the United Kingdom Space Agency. JPL, which is managed for NASA by Caltech in Pasadena, California, leads the U.S. component of the project. For the flight system payload, NASA is providing the KaRIn instrument, a GPS science receiver, a laser retroreflector, a two-beam microwave radiometer, and NASA instrument operations. CNES is providing the Doppler Orbitography and Radioposition Integrated by Satellite (DORIS) system, the dual frequency Poseidon altimeter (developed by Thales Alenia Space), the KaRIn radio-frequency subsystem (together with Thales Alenia Space and with support from the UK Space Agency), the platform, and ground control segment. CSA is providing the KaRIn high-power transmitter assembly. NASA is providing the launch vehicle and associated launch services.

"Lockheed, Thales move to bolster Aussie’s $1B AUD sovereign missile push - Breaking Defense","Wed, 05 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vYnJlYWtpbmdkZWZlbnNlLmNvbS8yMDIyLzEwL2xvY2toZWVkLXRoYWxlcy1tb3ZlLXRvLWJvbHN0ZXItYXVzc2llcy0xYi1hdWQtc292ZXJlaWduLW1pc3NpbGUtcHVzaC_SAXBodHRwczovL2JyZWFraW5nZGVmZW5zZS5jb20vMjAyMi8xMC9sb2NraGVlZC10aGFsZXMtbW92ZS10by1ib2xzdGVyLWF1c3NpZXMtMWItYXVkLXNvdmVyZWlnbi1taXNzaWxlLXB1c2gvP2FtcD0x?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LAND FORCES 2022 — Lockheed Martin, picked along with Raytheon to build highly advanced defense manufacturing capabilities in Australia to bulk up the nation’s ability to make and stockpile weapons at home, took its first step today to building a new missile factory.

“The message is clear. here. We’re open for business,” Pat Sunderlin, vice president of operations for Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, told reporters at the second day of Land Forces show in Brisbane. “Lockheed Martin will deliver and transfer to Australia the same level of technology and development and advanced programs and systems that we have in our factories in United States.”

The company announced it has hired an Australian company called Conscia “to identify potential future locations for central manufacturing” for a new factory. Sunderlin said the first new factory should be ready in two to three years from when Lockheed selects a location.

This is all part of a $1 billion AUD ($650 million USD) program called the Sovereign Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance Enterprise (GWEO), first announced in March 2021 by the previous Liberal Party government. Australia has committed to making more of its parts and weapons here, increasingly aware of its vulnerability to supply chain vulnerabilities posed by both adversaries and pandemics.

Lockheed and Raytheon are the largest suppliers of guided weapons to Australia. The government’s goal is for them to rapidly bolster its ability to maintain and manufacture guided weapons and their components in Australia.

Part of Lockheed’s goal is to “increase the speed of production and reliability and quality” in Australia, Sunderlin said.

In a statement, the company also announced it would open a new facility in partnership with Thales Australia in Mulwala, New South Wales as part of this effort. “It will bring Australia a step closer to a national guided weapons capability as well as set us up for potential future export of Australian manufactured products,” James Heading, Lockheed Martin Australia’s Director of Programs Strategic Capabilities Office for Missiles and Fire Control said in the statement.

Thales Australia already manages the government-owned facility at Mulwala and nearby Benalla, and “have made a significant investment in state-of-the-art advanced manufacturing equipment” there.

The Mulwala Facility is the only manufacturing site of military propellants and high explosives in Australia. The plant, first built between 1942-43, was substantially rebuilt at a cost of more than $415 million starting in 2001. Thales has managed it since then.

Lockheed and Raytheon have already held talks with the Australian government, trying to hammer out how to manage the complex supply chain for multiple weapons, Heading told reporters. “Are there common forging areas? Are there common electronics components and stuff that we need? Are we looking at sensors in the same way as each other — those sorts of things?” he said.

Most of the initial focus, once those details are hammered out, will be on putting “more missiles in the cupboard,” as Heading put it. That means missiles such as “Hellfire, JASM-ER and the like” that Australia is already buying or soon will."
Diehl and Thales honored for innovative cabin marketing - diehl.com,"Fri, 28 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZWhsLmNvbS9hdmlhdGlvbi9lbi9wcmVzcy1hbmQtbWVkaWEvcHJlc3MvZGllaGwtdW5kLXRoYWxlcy1ob25vcmVkLWZvci1pbm5vdmF0aXZlLWNhYmluLW1hcmtldGluZy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The industry’s leading aircraft suppliers Diehl Aviation and Thales Avionics have teamed up to combine their technologies to bring new and innovative solutions to the aircraft cabin. The latest joint solution between Thales and Diehl, the “In Cabin Experience Enhancer” (ICEE), won the prestigious Airline Passenger Experience Association (APEX) Best Marketing Innovation Award last week in Long Beach, California. With the ICEE, cabin surfaces such as partitions, luggage compartments and walls can be used as projection surfaces to display dynamic and changing content such as advertising, flight information and brand messaging.

The basis is the interaction of the innovative cabin projection system from Diehl Aerospace, a joint venture between Diehl Aviation and Thales Avionics and the digital platform of the IFE and InFlyt360 from Thales Avionics. The projections can thus be managed and updated with fresh content via wireless gate connectivity. Passengers can interact with the system via their individual in-seat-touchscreens. In addition to the marketing options mentioned, the ICEE offers considerable potential, especially for the maintenance area. If, for example, a luggage compartment is defective, the repair instructions can be projected directly onto it.

“Connecting the technologies of Thales and Diehl creates fascinating use cases for future cabins. The possibility of retrofitting existing cabins with such a customizable digital solution is an additional advantage. All of this is based on the close and trusting cooperation of both partners, whose competencies in combination enable a smart cabin of the future, “said Florian Maier, CEO Diehl Aerospace.

The facility is expected to provide “highly advanced” defense manufacturing capabilities to Canberra, bolstering its ability to produce military weapons and equipment at home.

The company said it had tapped the services of Australian firm Conscia to identify potential future manufacturing locations.

Lockheed Martin Vice President Pat Sunderlin revealed that the new factory would be ready two to three years after the final location selection.

“The message is clear here. We’re open for business,” he said. “Lockheed Martin will deliver and transfer to Australia the same level of technology and development and advanced programs and systems that we have in our factories in the US.”

Closer to Weapons Export Capability

Lockheed Martin is one of the largest suppliers of guided weapons to the Australian Defence Force (ADF).

Building a new factory in the country will advance the company’s goal of increasing the speed of production, reliability, and quality of missile weapons delivered to the ADF.

It will also reportedly bring Canberra closer to the future export capability of Australian-manufactured products.

“Lockheed Martin Australia and Thales Australia have unique and complementary backgrounds and expertise in the manufacture and delivery of weapons capabilities that together will provide further impetus for the Australian Government’s objective of expanding the national defense industrial and manufacturing capability,” Lockheed official James Heading stated.

Lockheed is also expanding its administrative offices in the country to support various manufacturing activities."

Nexter and Thales moving towards RAPIDFire CIWS first delivery - Naval News,"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vZXZlbnQtbmV3cy9ldXJvbmF2YWwtMjAyMi8yMDIyLzEwL25leHRlci1hbmQtdGhhbGVzLW1vdmluZy10b3dhcmRzLXJhcGlkZmlyZS1jaXdzLWZpcnN0LWRlbGl2ZXJ5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Nexter and Thales moving towards RAPIDFire CIWS first delivery Nexter and Thales are exhibiting the RAPIDFire system in its final configuration on the Nexter booth at Euronaval 2022. The delivery and integration of the first systems on a French Navy vessel is expected in early 2023.

One of the first systems produced will be installed on French Navy fleet replenishment tanker Jacques Chevallier in early 2023 ahead of the at-sea qualification phase. The RAPIDFire is being developed through the French Ministry of Armed Forces S40SA program, which encompasses different applications with different users.

The French Navy plans to order more than 40 units in different batches. The ongoing phase calls for the delivery of 8 systems, another one being used for testing and qualification. They should be followed by four successive batches of 10 units.

Designed to protect platforms from low-level air threats, including drones, RAPIDFire can autonomously and automatically acquire, identify and destroy a threat using target designation data provided by a combat management system. With a ready rack of 140 rounds of ammunition, corresponding to about 30 interceptions, the system offers effective firepower against drones and swarms of drones, avoiding attrition of surface-to-air missiles in the event of a saturation attack.

Thanks to automatic real-time selection of different types of ammunition, RAPIDFire is the only system capable of defeating all types of threats, including personal watercraft, free-floating mines, ships, loitering munitions, unmanned aerial systems, fighter jets, attack helicopters and missiles at ranges of up to 4,000 metres. On the BRF, the RAPIDFire will be coupled with a radar provided by the Danish manufacturer Terma. Another platforms on which the RAPIDFire will be installed are the 10 offshore patrol vessels known as “patrouilleurs océaniques” (PO), of which the first two are to be delivered in 2025.

RAPIDFire is extremely accurate and can defeat threats with no risk of collateral damage thanks to the coupling between the fire control system and the turret, and ultimately through the use of Anti Aerial Airburst (A3B) munitions, still in development. A3B rounds are time-fuzed for greater effectiveness against all types of targets and cannot be jammed, decoyed or triggered by clutter.

Scale model of the BRF. Note the Rapidfire gun.

RAPIDFire is built around the 40mm CTA gun suite and ammunition and has already been adopted by the armed forces of France, the United Kingdom and Belgium. The 40mm CTA gun just achieved another successful live firing trials campaign in Bourges, in the center of France. “We were very surprised about the results of the test”, a Nexter representative said. Live firing on a complete RAPIDFire system is expected before year’s end.

Besides naval applications, the RAPIDFire can be readily adapted for land-based platforms such as the CAESAR MkII truck chassis. Thanks to its intuitive user interface and on-the-move firing capability, this system can be seamlessly integrated into a fixed or mobile air defence system to protect combat units on the ground as well as military bases, logistics convoys, sensitive sites and high-value assets."
Thales plots the route to improved fuel efficiency - Arabian Aerospace,"Fri, 07 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHA6Ly93d3cudGltZXNhZXJvc3BhY2UuYWVyby9mZWF0dXJlcy90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3RoYWxlcy1wbG90cy10aGUtcm91dGUtdG8taW1wcm92ZWQtZnVlbC1lZmZpY2llbmN50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"People may think that demands for greener flight are a relatively new phenomenon, but in reality, they have always been there.

“Airlines have always wanted to cut fuel consumption to improve their bottom lines,” said Yannick Assouad, executive vice-president, Thales Avionics. Reducing CO2 emissions is just an added bonus in an environmentally aware world.

A number of trends for more efficient operations are emerging.

“We see replacing older aircraft within fleets as key,” she said. “Newer, leaner, more fuel-efficient aircraft can make a big difference to operating costs with up to 50% less fuel burn.”

She also expects to see a big increase in the development of synthetic fuels.

“But it may be 10-15 years before we see aircraft powered differently, by using hydrogen or battery/fuel-cell-powered electric motors,” she said.

Meanwhile, Thales thinks there are easier ways for airlines to save fuel. One of them is a more modern approach to flight management.

“Existing flight management systems (FMS) use old technology and there is no easy and quick way to change your route,” Assouad said. “But by making it a fully connected FMS you can bring in a lot more data to help the FMS choose the most efficient route.""

“For example, by taking advantage of tailwinds at a different altitude, significant cost savings can be made.”

Thales was recently selected by Airbus to equip its commercial airliners with a new innovative FMS. The new system, which is based on the Thales PureFlyt product, is being designed in particular for the A320, A330 and A350, significant numbers of which are operated by airlines in the Middle East and subcontinent, including the world's biggest fleets of A330s (Turkish Airlines) and A350s (Qatar Airways).

Entry into service is planned for the end of 2026.

The new system will optimise flight paths to help reduce the carbon footprint of airline operations. Thales says it is specifically designed to efficiently manage aircraft in a connected aerospace ecosystem and in increasingly crowded skies.

The FMS is the 'brain' of the aircraft and is used to prepare flights, set flight parameters and ensure aircraft guidance throughout the flight, including approach and landing procedures.

Designed from the outset to be connected and cybersecure, the system maximises the benefits of access to data including real-time weather information.

By linking the new FMS with non-avionics systems — such as the pilot’s Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) and airline operational control centres — the solution will make it quicker and easier to analyse flight plan revisions, providing the pilot with the best route and simplifying interaction with air traffic control (ATC).

Yannick Assouad: Data will help the FMS choose the most efficient route. Picture: Thales

Interconnecting the FMS with AvioBook, Thales’ EFB application suite, will give flightdeck crews access to an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) allowing them to quickly and accurately respond to dynamically changing conditions.

This relieves crew of the tedious, distracting and time-consuming task of manually updating the flight plan through a complex sequence of FMS button-presses. Instead, the pilots use the intuitive EFB GUI and then verify the changes on the new FMS before committing the changes to the active flight plan.

Thales says it will help to ease airport congestion, cut fuel consumption, decrease noise pollution and reduce pilot workload.

The company is drawing on experience gained on more than 100 million flight hours with Thales’ current generation of FMS systems, enabling airlines to benefit from an optimal combination of flight safety, operational efficiency and fuel savings.

It includes navigation and performance databases for the precise calculation of optimal flight paths and flight times. The plan is to make the FMS available for both new aircraft and retrofit.

Airbus’s choice of a system that is compatible with all its aircraft will enhance fleet interoperability for airlines and make it easier for pilots to make the transition from one Airbus aircraft type to another.

Typically, pilots only get up-to-date weather information from any on-board weather radar system. But any weather feature may be out of its range. Traditionally, EFBs only know about weather from out-of-date forecasts, but now they will be able to get up-to-date weather information while in flight.

The system can then suggest alternative routes to avoid thunderstorms or other adverse weather, complete with an updated estimated arrival time and any additional fuel burn.

This means pilots know what they are selecting from the outset.

For example, your original flight plan might be for flying at flight level 340, but the FMS might suggest flight level 375 to save fuel. If ATC agrees, you can then transfer to the new suggested routing and save the airline money.

Thales calls this trajectory management. Sometimes the pilot may have to deviate from the planned path. The new FMS will always calculate how to get back on track with a valid plan and it can do this 5-10 times faster than current systems.

Another new feature is vertical profiling on the EFB, showing the actual flight profile in a graphical display.

Thales thinks its new FMS, when introduced, could save 13 million tonnes of fuel and 40 million tonnes of CO2 per year.

“Forty per cent of an airline’s costs are on fuel, so any reductions would be very welcome,” said Assouad.

By combining the integrity of the FMS and the agility and power of the EFB, the aircraft trajectory can be permanently controlled, adapted and enhanced, resulting in optimised flight, decreased fuel consumption and improved passenger comfort.

At the end of a flight, the updated flight plan from the EFB is ready to be sent to the company at the touch of a button.

A team of 400 engineers at Thales’ operations in Toulouse and Bordeaux, along with commercial airline pilots, have been working on the new FMS."

The underwater environment is becoming increasingly crowded and hostile; hence, navies must acquire more and more resources that are progressively responsive, flexible and interconnected.

Indeed, fighting under the sea requires the deployment of considerable capacities and the coordination of means can sometimes meet limits. To reduce the risk of threat saturation, Thales and Schiebel successfully tested the reinforcement of conventional underwater capabilities with a CAMCOPTER® S-100 Unmanned Air System (UAS) during the NATO REPMUS 2022 exercise in Tróia, Portugal.

REPMUS22 was a real opportunity for the industry and the armed Forces to collaborate on the test and development of maritime unmanned systems, with 25 navies, and more than 20 research and development companies, two universities and eight NATO entities related to maritime operations and/or maritime unmanned systems.

The scenario chosen by the NATO was that of surveillance of a strategic access to a port, in order to detect and classify possible enemy submarines, using the best of innovative technologies.

To this end, Thales and Schiebel deployed a CAMCOPTER® S-100 UAV equipped with a data relay box, allowing the transmission distance of data from the acoustic buoys deployed in surveillance along the coast to be optimised. The data was successfully processed on land by the Thales Bluetracker system. The data could have also been processed on board a frigate cruising off the coast, in addition to the airborne means usually used (helicopters, maritime patrol aircraft).

The use of UAS allows navies to face new challenges with increasingly limited human resources. Fast, durable, flexible (multi-mission) and are a useful and efficient complement to an anti-submarine system.

This first participation in REPMUS 2022 for the Thales-Schiebel partnership opens perspectives on the force multiplier effect obtained through interoperable and interchangeable systems. Thanks to innovative technologies, whose basic building blocks already exist (buoys and UAVs) and soon thanks to the use of the new SonoFlash buoy developed by Thales, these unmanned systems will be able to demonstrate their usefulness in many theatres of operation.

On the detection segment, Xavier Mesnet, Thales' Naval Segment Director, told Naval News about a small diameter cable...

The focus for now: A small diameter cable...

There are two key challenges in Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW): detecting without putting the ship – and its crew – in harm’s way; and being able to continuously track the submarine. Detecting and tracking, today, involves triangulating information received – initially – from a ship’s sonar with information received from sonobuoys and dipping sonars launched and operated by Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) and ASW helicopters.

“Thales is now seeking to develop technologies that will also integrate unmanned systems in ASW operations,” Mesnet told Naval News. And one interesting way to do so is to develop solutions enabling Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to carry dipping sonar and act as trackers.

“The technology to launch and operate dipping sonars from helicopters today is too heavy and inadequate to be fitted onto UAVs, so Thales developed a small diameter cable.”

Xavier Mesnet, Thales’ Naval Segment Director

The small diameter cable is “less than 3 mm thick” and has an impressive length of “about 700 meters”. It is made of synthetic material and is not only strong enough to carry the weight of the dipping sonar, but it also transmits information from the sonar to the UAV. Once the UAV receives the information it relays it to all the other platforms – MPA, helicopter and/or ship. The use of this cable to enable tracking via UAVs offers more flexibility and speed: as the submarine moves, the UAV can simply roll the cable back in to extract the dipping sonar from the water – an operation far less cumbersome than reeling the sonar back into a helicopter – and move to the next position to deploy it again.

Both UAV and dipping sonar can function in full autonomy or remotely operated from the mother ship, “according to customer needs.” However, Thales is currently neither disclosing potentially interested customers nor Technology Readiness Level.

Thales very much keeps the lid on this promising technology: While the small diameter cable was showcased on their booth at Euronaval, pictures were not allowed. Thales didn’t wish to disclose how data travels in the cable, but the use of fiber optics is the most likely option."

Thales press release

Thales and OMT will work on designing a common solution for the Naval domain, the first could be deployed for the future Danish Navy. This collaboration will allow both partners to define the best trade-off when it comes to modularity and performances at sea.

CUBEDIN A/S, a joint venture between Odense Maritime Technology (OMT) and Systematic, has developed the CUBEDIN concept that enables interchangeable, adaptable ships to be easily reconfigured to suit any mission. CUBEDIN combines a physical interface with a software solution that allows navies to set up ship platforms using Cubes – or modules from SH Defence. The CUBEDIN software also provides a communication gateway between modules, such as sensors, and the vessel’s internal systems.

Thales will work with OMT to develop a new approach in the designing of modular Combat platforms, providing its Anti-Submarine Warfare and Mine Warfare technologies to these new vessels.

Its aim is to create a modular flexible platform integrating Thales’ sensors and systems into the CUBEDIN concept. CUBEDIN is a standardised interface communications system, which connects all parts of the ship’s systems, sonars and sensors to build the strongest defence.

This cooperation between Thales and CUBEDIN A/S demonstrates Thales’ ambition and commitment to partner with local companies to the benefit of both the local and international defense industry and customers.

“Thales is globally renowned for its expertise in naval sensors and systems. This partnership with CUBEDIN allows us to jointly develop the next generation of mission solutions, making us an even stronger player in the naval field and paving the way for future collaborations within the naval industry. Thales is committed to work together with local industries to maximize the benefits for our customers. This collaboration with worldwide player OMT will create new and exciting opportunities for both companies in Denmark and abroad.”

The system is the proposed “low-risk” solution for the second phase of Australia’s “Project Land 4100” land-based anti-ship missile program.

The StrikeMaster combines Kongsberg’s Naval Strike Missile (NSM) with a modified version of Thales’ Bushmaster armored vehicle for increased mobility and range.

Each system is equipped with two NSM launchers and state-of-the-art radar from CEA Technologies.

The anti-ship capability can penetrate sophisticated enemy defense systems to reach heavily-armed combat ships up to 250 kilometers away (155 miles).

According to Thales, integrating NSM launchers into the Bushmaster vehicles would provide the Australian Defence Force (ADF) with a “potent, disruptive, and proven” land-based maritime deterrent.

All StrikeMaster components can be domestically produced in Australia.

Competing System

American defense giant Lockheed Martin is also pitching its AGM-184C Long Range Anti-Ship Missile – Surface Launched mounted on an M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System.

According to the company, the solution offers a high degree of commonality with existing ADF systems and would meet the service’s requirements for anti-ship defense.

“I think the attractive features of the surface launch and ground launched missiles are that they’re identical missile stacks,” Lockheed Martin official Dominic DeScisciolo said. “In other words, the missiles are interchangeable between the Army and Navy.”"

"Thales continues biometric card R&D in France, approved by Mastercard for quantum security - Biometric Update","Mon, 17 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpb21ldHJpY3VwZGF0ZS5jb20vMjAyMjEwL3RoYWxlcy1jb250aW51ZXMtYmlvbWV0cmljLWNhcmQtcmQtaW4tZnJhbmNlLWFwcHJvdmVkLWJ5LW1hc3RlcmNhcmQtZm9yLXF1YW50dW0tc2VjdXJpdHnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales is developing biometric bank cards and working on eSIM technnologies at a French research facility in La Ciotat launched by Gemplus twenty years ago, the company tells La Provence. Gemplus then became Gemalto and was acquired by Thales.

The research center employs 600, among them engineers with advanced skills that focus on the development of biometric payment cards and other contactless mobile payment solutions.

The cybersecurity laboratory within La Ciotat’s design center is responsible, among other things, for improving the reliability of biometric bank cards.

According to La Provence, it was there that Thales developed the biometric technology that allows the payment of an invoice of more than 50 Euros during a contactless transaction using an imprint of a thumb or two fingers.

Further, the design center was also reportedly the cradle of the partnership between Handsome and Thales, which saw the creation of a voice payment card aimed at people with disabilities.

Finally, La Provence mentioned that the La Ciotat facility is being upgraded for 1 million euros (roughly US$985,000) as Thales develops software that works with an eSIM card to allow a person’s digital identity to be verified remotely through selfie biometrics.

The La Provence analysis comes weeks after Thales, in collaboration with Experian and Mitek, published a new survey indicating that deploying biometrics can help banks improve consumers’ trust.

Mastercard endorses first cards for defense against quantum threats

Mastercard revealed the approval of the first cards that are compatible with the new EMVCo contactless specifications, a standard designed to describe technology capable of withstanding attacks from both traditional and quantum computers. The approved cards are developed by Giesecke+Devrient and Thales.

“Technology has the potential to open new opportunities for both consumers and fraudsters. That’s why future-proofing security is critical,” comments Ajay Bhalla, president of cyber and intelligence at Mastercard.

According to the executive, by bringing quantum-era technology to contactless payments, Mastercard is taking steps to future-proof transaction security and privacy protection.

“These new cards will deliver that greater peace of mind while also providing consumers and merchants a seamless transition from today’s contactless experience.”

Bhalla confirmed the new cards are designed to remain compatible with existing acceptance, network and issuer infrastructure.

This post was updated at 10:02am Eastern on October 18, 2022 to clarify that research, rather than production, is being carried out at the La Ciotat facility, and the relationship between Gemplus and Thales.

The exercise involved both companies working under a pre-determined scenario that was chosen by Nato.

The UAS was required to safeguard a strategic port and monitor an enemy submarine from reaching it.

Under this scenario, the two companies deployed a Camcopter UAS, equipped with a relay box, a Wescam MX-8 electro-optical/infrared sensor and Thales’ BlueScan data relay sensor.

The relay system was primarily responsible for monitoring the data transmission process from sonobuoys and sending this data to the command cell deployed ashore.

This ensured the detection and classification of any potential enemy submarines.

The next step included the successful data processing on the land by using Thales’ Bluetracker sonobuoy processing system.

According to Thales, the other alternative for processing this data was by deploying a frigate cruising off the coast combined with an aerial vehicle such as a maritime patrol aircraft or a helicopter.

Deployment of an uncrewed aircraft allowed the participant naval forces to experience new challenges in a situation that involved limited human resources.

The test validated Camcopter S-100 UAS’ capabilities to be deployed as an anti-submarine warfare system.

During the same exercise, Airbus also tested a sub-scale prototype of its new ‘cargo copter’ UAS."
"Thales to supply next-generation command, liaison and reconnaissance armoured vehicles to Luxembourg Army in ... - EDR Magazine","Tue, 25 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lZHJtYWdhemluZS5ldS90aGFsZXMtdG8tc3VwcGx5LW5leHQtZ2VuZXJhdGlvbi1jb21tYW5kLWxpYWlzb24tYW5kLXJlY29ubmFpc3NhbmNlLWFybW91cmVkLXZlaGljbGVzLXRvLWx1eGVtYm91cmctYXJteS1pbi1sYXRlc3QtbW92ZS10by1lbmhhbmNlLWV1cm9wZWFuLWludGVyb3BlcmFiaWxpdHnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"25 October 2022 – The Luxembourg Directorate of Defence has selected Thales and its partners General Dynamics European Land Systems (GDELS) and FN Herstal to supply 80 command, liaison and reconnaissance vehicles (CLRV) for the Luxembourg Army.

The procurement programme, managed by the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA), will supply the Luxembourg armed forces a modern fleet of land vehicles that is interoperable with other NATO countries.

As programme prime contractor, Thales will provide all the onboard technologies required to support data-driven operations and collaborative engagements, including the common vehicle architecture (vetronics) and the software-defined radio systems developed under France’s CONTACT programme.

The Luxembourg Directorate of Defence has announced the procurement of 80 armed command, liaison and reconnaissance vehicles (CLRV) to provide the Luxembourg Army with a modern, secure and interoperable solution that will enable the country’s armed forces to continue to perform their missions effectively.

To counter new threats and demonstrate unity with their NATO allies, the Luxembourg armed forces are in the process of modernising their capabilities in order to increase operational capacities under all circumstances and conduct all types of military reconnaissance missions.

Armed vehicle crews are particularly vulnerable. To operate more effectively and in greater safety, they need to understand, decide and act faster than the adversary at all times. Information needs to be shared immediately so that threats can be neutralised as quickly as possible after they have been detected. Thales and its partners bring to the table the level of experience in digital systems and high-tech equipment that the Luxembourg armed forces need to stay better protected in every situation, including high-intensity combat.

The procurement includes the acquisition of 80 command, liaison and reconnaissance vehicles (CLRV) as well as the logistical support and communication system updates needed to maximise vehicle operability and optimise fleet availability.

In addition to its role as programme prime contractor, Thales is responsible – as it is for France’s Scorpion programme – for developing and producing the common combat vetronics for the new platforms, including the provision of the vehicles’ communication, local situational awareness, self-protection and navigation systems.

This increased interoperability between the land forces of Luxembourg and France can be the basis for future international collaborative combat operations.

“We are delighted that the Luxembourg Directorate of Defence has placed its trust in Thales and our partners to propel its armed forces into the era of collaborative combat. As a recognised industry leader in intelligent onboard systems, Thales is proud to be playing its part in projecting Luxembourg’s operational capabilities into the future.” Alain Quevrin, Thales Country Director Belgium and Luxembourg.

Opportunity: Increased demand for hardware security modules with the advent of 5G

5G offers a plethora of opportunities for businesses to grow. However, if security issues are not addressed with a new trust model for the 5G era, these advantages can also be threats to the confidentiality and integrity of critical data. With 5G, various data types will be processed everywhere, from the network edge to the core. The security environment is evolving due to 5G. Beyond consumer mobile broadband to industries and organizations, there is an increasing demand for security to effectively address an increasing number of new use cases and devices. Securing 5G requires ensuring sensitive data security. Sensitive data is consistently protected across on-premises, cloud, or hybrid storage via encryption and crypto key management. Thales is one of the leaders in the hardware security modules market. The performance, adaptability, and scalability requirements for subscriber privacy and authentication security from the data center to the edge are met by Thales’ solutions. Public key infrastructures (PKIs), such as digital certificate management for cell towers, are given additional protection by the company’s 5G Luna hardware security modules. In the coming years, the demand for data security is likely to rise, resulting in increased demand for hardware security modules.

Challenge: Complex integration process

Hardware security modules are complex to integrate with commonly used tools and platforms. While client integrations vary between hardware security module providers, they often do not support all tools needed in a corporate environment. Hardware security, such as hardware encryption, is often coupled to a specific device, making it less adaptable than its software counterpart because one solution cannot be used to secure the entire system and all of its components. If a company uses tools not already integrated with its hardware security modules, it needs to develop a customized integration. Hardware security modules only expose a small number of interfaces (usually PKCS11, JCE, or CAPI/CNG), which makes developing customized integrations challenging and expensive. As a result, some organizations forgo the integrations altogether and simply leave private key material on end-user workstations to improve performance, leading to security risks.

"Kongsberg, Thales unveil StrikeMaster for Australia's land-based anti-ship capability - Defense Brief","Tue, 04 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vZGVmYnJpZWYuY29tLzIwMjIvMTAvMDQva29uZ3NiZXJnLXRoYWxlcy11bnZlaWwtc3RyaWtlbWFzdGVyLWZvci1hdXN0cmFsaWFzLWxhbmQtYmFzZWQtYW50aS1zaGlwLWNhcGFiaWxpdHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Kongsberg Australia and Thales Australia have officially introduced the StrikeMaster, their solution for Australia’s land-based maritime strike capability, at the Land Forces 2022 exhibition in Brisbane.

StrikeMaster blends Konsgberg’s Naval Strike Missile (NSM) with the Thales-built Bushmaster armored vehicle.

The companies are pitching the system as a “low-risk” solution for Australia’s Project Land 4100 Phase 2, which will see the country invest up to A$500 million in the program, with a tentative delivery date for first systems set by 2024.

All of the components of the StrikeMaster could be manufactured locally by the two companies’ Australian hubs.

StrikeMaster features a modified Bushmaster vehicles with two NSM launchers while the system can also include CEA Technologies radars, according to earlier reports.

The StrikeMaster would provide Australian forces with the ability to strike ships and other targets at sea at ranges of more than 250 kilometers.

While the Bushmaster is already in service with the army, the navy is currently in the process of acquiring the NSM for its Anzac-class frigates and Hobart-class destroyers. Starting in 2024, the NSM will replace the Harpoon anti-ship missile currently in service.

Other contenders in Project LAND 4100 Phase 2 emerge

While Kongsberg and Thales were the first duo to confirm their participation in LAND 4100 as early as this spring, they are now not the only ones.

Lockheed Martin has unveiled its solution for Australia’s land-based anti-ship capability needs. It comes in the form of an AGM-184C Long Range Anti Ship Missile Surface Launched (LRASM-SL) mounted on a M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS).

According to Naval News, Lockheed Martin is touting a high degree of commonality for the presented solution, with Lockheed spokesperson Dominic DeScisciolo saying that the LRASM-SL for the army would have “a high degree of commonality with those being offered to the navy.”

To remind, Australia already has 200 LRASMs on order under a $990 million contract from July 2020, and Lockheed is working on the integration of the missile on Royal Australian Air Force F/A-18 E/F Super Hornets. The company is also working with Thales Australia on the development of booster and rocket motor technology for the LRASM-SL."

Tony Burton

This article originally featured in Teiss.

Over a decade ago, a computer virus or 'worm', henceforth known as 'Stuxnet', aimed to physically disrupt a nuclear power plant in the Middle East. Those responsible attempted to hijack the computer system with this virus to seize control of the entire plant. With potentially disastrous consequences at play – look no further than the fallout of the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters - there were big learnings to be made when it comes to the cybersecurity of operational technology.

Indeed, as the first major disruptive cyberattack on critical infrastructure, there was a prevalent fear of reoccurrence following Stuxnet. Yet 12 years on, and numerous similar attempts later, many factories and critical national infrastructures are making the same mistakes today. With cybercriminals’ techniques becoming increasingly sophisticated, and with surging numbers of smart factories and IoT technologies to infiltrate, there’s arguably no better time to take a better look at our operational cyber resilience.

So, what must businesses learn to safeguard against the potentially catastrophic risks that operational technology-focused attacks pose, to ensure this never happens again? Tony Burton, Managing Director – Cyber Security & Trust at Thales UK shares his insights...

Disaster vs. Disruption? Take Both Seriously

Whilst a nuclear disaster is arguably the most catastrophic potential impact faced by a cyber breach, the risk of disruption is arguably just as much of a threat for businesses – and a more likely one. In fact, inflicting operational disruption is far easier for perpetrators, and therefore more of a commonplace occurrence.

Businesses nowadays, especially in the past 12 years, have increasingly relied on automation and focused on enhancing efficiency, resorting to advanced technologies to enable them to do this.

Today, many factories dealing with raw materials, for example, will use an enterprise IT system and employ AI software and predictive analytics to observe the status of stock and assess when and where to automatically order in new materials.

Whilst this is incredibly beneficial for operations, this integration between IT and operational technology has made them incredibly complex, highly diverse, and inter-dependent technologies. This means that if any one of these interlinked systems goes wrong or is compromised, the entire system of operations and supply chain comes to a halt. This makes them fragile and easy targets to intercept – and often with huge knock-on effects to be felt.

The subsequent disruption to ‘business as usual’ means operations become fractured. This happened with oil firm Saudi Aramco in 2012, when cybercriminals deployed a virus to infect around 35,000 of its computers within the space of a few hours. Compromising Saudi Aramco’s IT infrastructure ultimately meant they couldn’t perform operations, putting the supply of the world’s oil at risk by default. This reportedly took two weeks to recover, but the far-reaching implications no doubt waned on far longer.

Lesson: the threat of disruption should be taken seriously, and its implications are greater than just inconvenience – they can impact you operationally, financially, and reputationally.

Risk Reduction: Go Back to Basics

Major US gas pipeline, Colonial Pipeline, was hacked just last year in 2021, leading to widespread shortages across the East Coast. This large-scale attack was tracked back to a single compromised password from one of their employees. This very scenario of human error serves as testament to the importance of cyber hygiene across the entire business and ensuring seemingly innocuous habits are up to scratch.

Lesson: You cannot underestimate the importance of training employees, running risk assessments, stress testing risk breach attempt scenarios, and promoting good cyber hygiene as standard practice, including the following:

Prepare for the threat: Create, maintain, and test encrypted, offline backups of critical data. Develop and exercise both a cyber incident response & communications plan. Make digital asset management a key competency for your organisation. Create and maintain a cybersecurity awareness training program for your users

Harden your systems: Keep systems up to date, consistently maintained, and use appropriate tools and security teams to regularly test and evaluate your environments. For those critical systems where updates are challenging, make sure to add layered defences and threat detection capabilities to further protect those systems from attack

Implement multi-factor authentication: Verify users and system components using multiple factors (not just simple passwords) and according to the risk associated with the role, requested access or function

Implement the least privilege principle: Allow users only the minimum necessary access to perform their job — nothing more. System components should be allowed only the minimum functionality required

Segment your network: Logically & physically divide your network infrastructure into smaller parts to make it more manageable to protect and contain the damage if one part is compromised

Encrypt all your data: Protect all your data, whether stored or transmitted. In the event of a data breach, the encrypted data will be of little value to the attackers

Shift to a Resilience Mindset

While reducing the likelihood of compromise is important, cyber breaches are the inevitable price you pay for doing business nowadays; it’s a matter of when, not if. So, while you can do all you can to prevent their occurrence, when compromises do occur, businesses need to be well equipped to ensure full scale destruction and mass disruption does not. In other words, we should move away from the ‘no compromise’ approach to more a resilient, realistic approach to cybersecurity. It’s not just about being able to detect threats, it’s about being well-positioned to get back on your feet and make a full recovery after a successful breach attempt.

As an industry standard, businesses should look at their business operations and identify the highly consequential risks that they simply cannot afford to happen (i.e., the likes of high impact destruction) and safeguard the entire gateway of those associated systems so it’s impossible for cybercriminals to reach those targets.

Once satisfied from a destruction and safety perspective, there’s still a massive amount of surrounding disruption risks to contend with. So, what can be done?:

Undergo regular tabletop exercises to simulate attacks on your operational technology, reflecting on your preparedness to sufficiently deal with that impending threat

Adapt where you prove weak or fragile and introduce additional resiliency measures and security controls where needed

Think beyond yourself – look at your vendors and IT service providers. They may well be the source for infiltrating your operational technology, too

Continue to monitor proactively, rather than being reactive. Stuxnet was effective because the employees had no idea it was a cyberattack at play, rather than something physical – it flew under the radar because they weren’t on the lookout

Don’t rely on efficiency. While it’s incredible beneficial, have back up plans for your operations should a highly dependent system be taken down

Lesson: It’s not all about risk reduction. In today’s landscape, it’s about ensuring you’re best prepared to tackle breach attempts head on when they do strike, with a robust response plan in place to mitigate the severity of the impact.

It may be 12 years since Stuxnet, but it’s not too late for businesses to take a hard look at the cyber resilience of their operational technology and learn from others’ mistakes in the process. With far-reaching implications a very real possibility – whether they be destructive or disruptive in nature – and operational technology increasingly at risk, businesses need to keep their wits about them to ensure Stuxnet isn’t repeated.

Emma Chivers, Graduate Engineer

Thales in the UK understands that having a diverse workforce is essential for its continued success, which is why we are committed to addressing the historic gender imbalance in UK STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) industries. Currently, only 16.5 per cent of the UK engineering industry is made up of women and we know from 16 onwards, the number of young women studying STEM subjects falls dramatically, which is why we work with schools, colleges and STEM partners to help everyone see the exciting career paths available in these sectors.

At present, 23 per cent of Thales employees are women - a figure we are determined to increase. We are committed to doing whatever it takes to enable women to excel in their careers and continue to grow the company's diversity.

We’re looking for the next generation of ambitious engineering graduates who’ll shape the future of engineering at Thales in the UK. We’re committed to turn our raw graduate potential into innovative and skilled professionals who can grow our business.

We’re also looking for new entrants to our Business Management Programme – with placements at the heart of the business.

We recently talked to one of our engineering graduates, Emma Chivers, about her experiences as a STEM student, her impressions of working life at Thales in the UK and her hopes for the future.

Emma is a 24-year-old master’s degree graduate, originally from Portsmouth.

She studied aerospace engineering at the University of Bristol, as a four-year integrated course, before joining Thales’s graduate programme.

What drew you into pursuing a career in engineering?

At school I took maths, further maths and physics A-levels at college, and really enjoyed those subjects. When it came to applying for university, I was looking for a qualification that had an immediate practical use, which led me to considering engineering. I looked at the different branches of engineering and found aerospace was a good fit with my interests.

A related topic that interested me was sustainability. Now I’m in the engineering industry, it’s becoming clear that everyone is trying to incorporate that aspect into aerospace developments. That’s really important to me.

Tell us about what you’ve been doing on the Thales graduate programme?

I joined it just over a year ago. The engineering graduate scheme lasts four years and includes four year-long placements. I think a year for each one is just right. It gives you time to understand the project and make an impact. On the other hand, if you find you’re not as interested in that placement, you don’t have long to wait for the next one.

My first one was based at Crawley, working on an avionics project. My work mostly revolved around model-based test planning. I got involved in a lot of tasks, including major project management decisions with senior colleagues.

I’m now just a couple of weeks into my second placement. This time it involves sonar technology, which is relatively new to me, and I’m hoping I’ll get to see some submarines as part of it. The project will be mainly focused on modelling, for which I’m going back to some of the equations and things I thought I’d left behind at uni.

Do you move around the country between placements?

Yes. I’ve now moved from Crawley to Cheadle, near Manchester. This is an aspect that attracted me to the Thales graduate scheme compared with some of the competitors. I didn’t know where I wanted to live and work, and I’m enjoying the opportunity to move and see other places.

What else made you choose Thales amongst all the other graduate schemes?

The chance to change roles each year was one of the biggest attractions. It offered a lot of flexibility and contact with the whole business. For the first two years, the Thales scheme also includes a course in engineering management with the University of Cranfield, which I found enticing.

It makes for a comfortable transition, meaning you’re not leaving university completely behind and going straight into full-time work.

Another key influence on my decision was my university tutor, who worked for Thales and was one of our best lecturers. Talking to her reassured me that Thales was a diverse and interesting company to work for, and it’s proved true.

Are you feeling positive about Thales helping you to excel in your career?

Definitely. Being able to change placements and decide where to go next gives me confidence, especially. That will help me in deciding, toward the end of the scheme, what area I want to roll off into permanently. We also have mentors who support us in working out our preferred direction and what we need to do to get there. What we’re learning on the university course will be helpful too, ensuring we’re ready for chartership in the future.

By the end of the four years, we should all have found a role that suits us. The factors shaping that choice will include the people we’ve met, the networks we’ve created, the particular skills we’ve developed and the knowledge we’ve gained of different areas of the business. Everyone will see a clear path and options for career progression. For me, there’s still much to work out in terms of what role I see for myself, but I know the support I need is there.

The flexibility to move within the company isn’t limited to the graduate scheme, either, it extends into full-time roles as well. It feels like Thales is very keen to help people find the role that suits them best – and to be the best they can be.

What’s your long-term ambition?

I think it’ll become clear as I go through the placements. One question I’m working on is whether I’d prefer a technical role or more of a managerial position. I’m hoping to get stuck into a lot of technical content in my new project.

Another consideration is what branch of engineering I want to specialise in. I started out thinking it would be strictly aerospace, but the new project is letting me explore something completely new and interesting. The graduate programme is opening my eyes to new sectors and will help me discover where my real passion lies.

One of the things that put me off some of the competitors’ graduate schemes was the way you had to commit to one role from the start. What if you found you didn’t like it? Would you be able to try a different one or would you have to leave? I don’t have that worry with Thales.

Before joining Thales, what was your experience of the challenges faced by women in engineering?

When I went to university, I was already well aware of how few women there were in the STEM industry. Of a hundred people on my engineering course, fewer than ten were female.

I always knew I liked maths and physics, but I never saw engineering as something I could do. I thought of it in terms of hands-on work, and it wasn’t until I started applying for universities that a family member suggested I look at engineering. Reading through university prospectuses, I realised what was available and it suddenly clicked – very late in my school life.

It’s not an industry that many people are aware of as children. But I think boys are more likely to find their way into it, as their interest in military games and stories makes them think about things like aircraft.

What has been your experience of Thales’s efforts to attract women into engineering?

Thales has definitely made strides here with its strong focus on inclusion. Amongst the staff already working in the company, Thales tries to raise awareness of the challenges different people face. Networks have been set up so women in the company can share ideas and problems, or just find familiar and friendly faces.

The company is also supportive and flexible to women around maternity breaks and other family-related needs. I’m not at that stage of life yet, but I’ve spoken to female colleagues who’ve said that Thales is very good at giving them the time they need, and not letting it affect promotions or future ambitions. Even if they’re not physically present at work, the company always keeps them in mind.

In both of my placements so far, I’ve been reassured to see women as heads of departments. Although men outnumber women as a whole in the organisation, it’s really inspiring to have met women in positions I might aspire to in the future.

Do you feel passionately about changing people’s perception of women in engineering?

I do. All Thales graduates are given 80 hours a year to dedicate to voluntary activities. Some of my voluntary work this year has been targeted at showing girls that they can be involved in STEM work, and trying to be a role model for them.

I’d like to think it won’t be long before there’s much less of a difference in the numbers of male and female applicants for engineering degrees. In university and job recruitment processes, there does seem to be a lot of effort now toward being fair to all types of people.

The launch of this land-based maritime strike capability, the StrikeMaster, will provide the Australian Defence Forces with greater critical mass and deployable combat power that aligns with Australia’s defence strategy.

The NSM (Naval Strike Missile) is a very flexible system that can be launched from a variety of platforms against a variety of targets on sea and land. The airframe design and the high thrust-to-weight ratio give the NSM extremely good manoeuvrability. The missile is completely passive, has proven its excellent sea-skimming capabilities and with its advanced terminal manoeuvres, it will survive the enemy air defences. The Autonomous Target Recognition (ATR) of the seeker ensures that the correct target is detected, recognized and hit, at sea or on land. NSM is the main weapon for the Royal Norwegian Navy’s frigates and coastal corvettes. It has been selected by the US Navy, US Marine Corps, Poland, Romania, Canada, Germany, Australia and Malaysia.

Testing: Space-bound US-European water mission passes finals - Phys.org,"Tue, 04 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDIyLTEwLXNwYWNlLWJvdW5kLXVzLWV1cm9wZWFuLW1pc3Npb24uaHRtbNIBQWh0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDIyLTEwLXNwYWNlLWJvdW5kLXVzLWV1cm9wZWFuLW1pc3Npb24uYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The SWOT spacecraft is seen during testing at a Thales Alenia Space facility near Cannes, France. Credit: CNES/Thales Alenia Space

Before any NASA mission is launched, the spacecraft goes through weeks of harsh treatment. It's strapped to a big table that shakes as hard as the pounding of a rocket launch. It's bombarded with louder noise than a stadium rock concert. It's frozen, baked, and irradiated in a vacuum chamber that simulates the extremes of space. The Surface Water and Ocean Topography mission (SWOT), a collaborative U.S.-French mission to monitor all the water on Earth's surface, has passed these major tests. Now, except for a few final checks, SWOT is ready for its December launch.

Some of SWOT's engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California have invested almost a decade in designing, building, and assembling this complex mission. Watching the instruments they've labored over go through the latest round of tests has been stressful, but the team has taken the process in stride. That's because every part of SWOT, down to nuts and bolts, had been tested multiple times before the satellite entered the thermal vacuum chamber for the last time. The engineers say the earlier tests produced far more anxiety.

Phoebe Rhodes-Wickett, a mechatronics engineer at JPL, has spent a quarter of her life working on SWOT. She initially focused on a small component used to deploy the antennas on the spacecraft's main instrument. ""The first time I tested my mechanism, I was terrified,"" she said. About as big as a box of tissues, the component was tested on a full-size shaker table. ""It was just this little mechanism sitting by itself. The test is loud, and you can see the mechanism moving,"" added Rhodes-Wickett. ""We had a failure in our first round of testing. We had to redesign and retest the mechanism in a few months' time to get it certified as spaceworthy.""

After passing that retest, the mechanism was connected to larger and larger systems that were finally integrated into the complete SWOT spacecraft. Every phase of spacecraft assembly creates new connections and presents another avenue for human error to creep in, so it ends with another round of tests. Rhodes-Wickett's mechanism passed vibration testing three more times since that first experience. ""Each test you pass is a relief,"" she said, ""but by the time you get to the third or fourth test, your stress level is much lower.""

The mechanism is part of SWOT's new radar instrument, which is the first of its kind in space. The Ka-band Radar Interferometer, or KaRIn, has two radar antennas mounted on mechanical arms. Once SWOT is in orbit, the arms will unfold from opposite sides of the spacecraft and extend until the antennas are almost 33 feet (10 meters) apart. Just as the space between your eyes helps you to judge distance and depth better, the space between KaRIn's two antennas helps the instrument reveal more details about Earth's water. But if the process isn't almost perfect—if the mechanical arms don't extend fully or the antennas are misaligned by even a few thousandths of a degree—KaRIn can't make the hoped-for measurements.

Risky business

""It's a unique part of a career at NASA that we're always trying to build stuff that's never been built before,"" said JPL's Eric Slimko, chief mechanical engineer on SWOT. That means every NASA payload starts with an unknown risk factor. Most missions gain some sense of the risk level by deploying prototype instruments on aircraft and in labs, but there's still the (literally) sky-high additional challenge of adapting the technology to survive launch and work in space. ""We don't have the capability of eliminating all that risk by an analysis on a piece of paper,"" he said. ""We have to test it."" Even off-the-shelf parts are certified.

SWOT will collect information on sea level height, which will help scientists study the role of currents in moderating climate change, as well as the elevations of bodies of fresh water. The mission is jointly led by NASA and CNES with contributions from the U.K. and Canadian space agencies. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/CNES/Thales Alenia Space

Designing tests that could prove the folding arm and antenna assembly will perform as well in orbit as they do on Earth was ""very, very challenging,"" Slimko said. ""For one thing, we can't turn off gravity. But we developed a verification program that, even though we cannot re-create the exact flight environment on the ground, we still have complete confidence that it will work in space.""

Carrying out the program required dozens of JPL engineers to spend weeks or months at the Thales Alenia Space facility in Toulouse, France, working with colleagues from the French space agency Centre Nationale d'Études Spatiales (CNES) to complete the series of tests as the spacecraft was assembled. The spacecraft includes hardware from not only CNES and NASA but also the United Kingdom and Canadian space agencies, with each team monitoring the performance of its own parts during testing.

Now almost all that remains is the ultimate test: the launch itself. The engineers are more than ready. ""It's fun to have a baby that you literally dreamed up, helped to grow, and now you're walking it to the finish line,"" Rhodes-Wickett said.

The 40 CTAS (40 mm Cased Telescoped Armament System) developed by CTA International, the JV between BAE Systems and Nexter, is under series production and is now in service in the French Army, and soon in the Belgian Army, installed in the T40 two-man turret fitted onto the Jaguar 6×6 reconnaissance armoured vehicle. The same 40 CT cannon has been delivered to the UK MoD for the British Army Ajax tracked vehicle.

In the early 2010s Nexter and Thales, with CTAI, exhibited an air defence turret including the same cannon, for both ground and naval applications, which was known as RAPIDFire. It was developed by an industrial team formed by the three aforementioned companies, responsible respectively for the turret, the sensors, fire control system and integration, and for the cannon and ammunition.

At Euronaval 2022 one of the first three pre-series RAPIDFire turrets in the naval version will be exhibited; the system is now fully developed and ready to enter full scale production. Its core remains the 40 CT cannon. As a recap, this employs a peculiar ammunition design, in which the projectile is embedded in the tubular case, hence the “cased telescoped” name of the weapon. This round allows the adoption of a side-loading system that permits to shift from one type of ammunition to another while having a link-less single feed system. The loading/expulsion cycle is based on a rotating chamber, the round being fed at 90° from the barrel; the chamber rotates aligning the munition with the barrel, the round is fired, the chamber rotates again and the next round ensures the expulsion of the spent case, shortening the firing cycle, reducing jamming risks, and avoiding the need of linked ammunition.

This mechanism is common to the cannon currently in use on land vehicles as well as on that installed on the RAPIDFire turret. The Naval version has been designed considering the maritime environment plus specific naval safety requirements. In order to address air targets, a specific anti aerial airburst round (A3B) is under development.

In the land version the 40 CTAS installed on the Jaguar can fire any type of available ammunition, which include: Two high explosive rounds, the General Purpose Round Point Detonation Tracer (GPR-PD-T) and the General Purpose Round Air Burst Tracer (GPR-AB-T), a kinetic energy antitank Armour Piercing Fin Stabilised Discarding Sabot (APFSDS) round, and a Training Practice Tracer (TP-T) round available also in the reduced range (TPRR-T) version. According to available data the GPR-PD-T can defeat a 210 mm thick concrete wall at 1,000 meters, the GPR-AB-T can spread splinters on a 125 m2 surface on the ground, while the APFSDS round can penetrate 140 mm of rolled-homogeneous armour at 1.5 km. Finally the A3B (Anti-Aerial Air Burst) as it is known in France, while internationally it is named KEAB (Kinetic Energy Air Burst is currently under development.

Coming to RAPIDFire, the gun will mainly use the latter round that is optimised for air defence; it will have the same programmable fuse used on the GPR-AB-T round, and will release a payload of 660 grams of tungsten pellets that will form a cloud of sub-projectiles in front of the target. The shape of those pellets was specifically designed to cause maximum damage to air targets considered for RAPIDFire, such as helicopters, missiles, etc, as well as against drones, which are becoming one of the most dangerous assets especially when operating in swarms. According to available information the new round will be able to engage those targets up to 4,000 meters. EDR On-Line understood that eight rounds are considered sufficient to defeat a target, the best option being firing a 4-round burst at 4,000 meters, waiting to fire a second one a few seconds later after damage assessment, when the target has closed distance to possibly 2,500 meters. For increasing accuracy an 80 round/minute rate of fire is considered the best, rather than the maximum one which is 200 rounds/minute.

Being a full bore calibre round, with a muzzle velocity lower than the APFSDS, the A3B/KEAB has a wear factor similar to that of GPR munitions or even lower. It is however 5% heavier, therefore to maintain a comparable impulse during firing the weight of the cannon has been increased, the moving mass stepping up from around 340 to 360 kg. This increase was obtained adopting a heavy duty barrel and adding a corresponding ballast at the back of the gun to maintain the balance on the trunnions. The increased thickness of the barrel does not pose any problem in production, as the dimensions of the original steel block from which the land version of the gun is manufactured is well sufficient also for producing the heavy duty one. A new muzzle brake is installed, with three baffles, compared to the two of the Jaguar cannon, the latter being however qualified for firing also the A3B/KEAB.

As said, being exposed to the effects of saline water all components of the naval cannon have been submitted to peculiar surface treatments in order to ensure adequate protection.

Coming to the RapidFire turret, it has flat and slightly inclined sides, and is installed over a mount that allows avoiding any intrusion in the ship deck. The overall elevation arc is 85°, maximum elevation depending on the depression required by the customer. The air defence variant has a weight of 3.5 tonnes with ammunition, compared to the 4.5 to 6 tonnes of the T40 installed on the Jaguar. The standard U-shape ammunition magazine located under the weapon contains 140 rounds, over the double of the 64 ready to fire ammunition available in the Jaguar T40; however in the latter it is possible to reload under armour, which is not the case in the naval/air defence variant. The RAPIDFire industrial team also offers a 70-round magazine as an option. The RAPIDFire can address surface-to-surface as well surface to air targets. A higher number of gyros are installed to ensure accurate data to the stabilisation system. To test the latter, Nexter acquired a hexapod that was used to simulate the ship behaviour in rough seas. According to industry sources servo motors used on the air defence version have a comparable power with those of the much heavier land turret, and provide considerably higher angular speed and acceleration. Finally, to cope with naval fire prevention regulations all cabling had to be modified, the norms being pretty different from those imposed for land applications. The RAPIDFire weight allows it to be installed on ships beyond 30 meters long.

Coming to the fire control system, here is where Thales comes into play thanks to its experience in surface-to-air FCS. The dedicated gyro-stabilized optronic sight, installed on the left side of the gun, offers a high accuracy of firing. It is wholly new, and includes infrared and daylight channels and a laser range finder. The latter is of the pulse type with high rate, a key factor in air defence use according to industry, as it allows around 10 measurements per second with very high accuracy well over 10 km distance. The cooled thermal camera operates in the medium wave IR spectrum and is fully digital, no more details being available. Through the optronic sight the operator, which RAPIDFire console is usually located in the ship combat operations centre, can identify the target prior the engagement, track it, adjust if needed the shooting automatically proposed by the system, select the right burst and ammunition, and assess the result of the engagement. As said, most of the ammunition load will be made of A3B/KEAB rounds optimised against air threats, however other ammunition including GPRs can also be loaded, especially when the RAPIDFire is used as a close-in defence system against small and fast surface vessels. The optronic system case is designed with growth potential in mind, one of the possible additions being that of a laser emitter for guiding laser beam-riding ammunition. To further increase its all weather capacity the RAPIDFire turret was designed to accept a tracking radar, allowing it to operate in fully autonomous mode. This should be installed at the centre on top of the turret.

The RAPIDFire can obviously be integrated into the ship combat system, exploiting existing on-board radars as well as COC consoles, to which the relevant software would be added. A dedicated console can also be installed, which is the solution chosen by the French Marine Nationale, EDR On-Line understood, in order to be able to operate it also autonomously, for example in passive surveillance mode using optronics. Models of the turret with a radar were seen on the scale model of the future French aircraft carrier. The French Navy considers that in missions such as those in coastal waters or when the ship is at anchor, an autonomous passive mode is to be preferred to the fully integrated one using an active sensor, as in some scenarios it is preferable not switching on the radar for security or safety measures.

The turret exhibited at Euronaval is fully operational, and following the exhibition the first pre-production Naval RAPIDFire will be installed on the Jacques Chevallier, the first French Navy BRF (Bâtiment Ravitailleur de Forces) replenishment vessel and will start acceptance trials at sea. The same turret will be installed on the remaining three BRFs to be delivered within 2029, but the industrial team aims providing the RAPIDFire also for future ocean patrol vessels (PO, for Patrouilleur Océanique), as well as for mine warfare vessels. As for the export market, multi-role patrol corvettes to be build within a European programme are also being considered. EDR On-Line understood that the same turret exhibited at Euronaval will be proposed for ground-based air defence applications as Ground RAPIDFire, with only minor modification, one of them being clearly the adoption of different algorithms for stabilisation.

Final Roussen-Class Fast Guided Missile Ship Joins Greek Navy - The Defense Post,"Tue, 04 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRlZmVuc2Vwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIyLzEwLzA0L2Zhc3QtZ3VpZGVkLW1pc3NpbGUtc2hpcC1ncmVlay1uYXZ5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Greek Hellenic Navy has officially commissioned its seventh and final Roussen-class fast guided missile patrol vessel, HS Ypoploiarchos Vlahakos (P79).

During the September 29 launching, the navy said its new patrol vessel was named after Lieutenant Panagiotis Vlahakos, who lost his life in a helicopter crash during the 1996 Imia crisis with Turkey.

Ypoploiarchos Vlahakos

The newest addition to the Greek naval fleet is equipped with sensors and weapon systems similar to the sixth Roussen-class vessel, Ypoploiarchos Karathanasis (P78).

The last two ships feature an “upgraded Thales Vigile 100 R-ESM system and the new generation Thales STIR 1.2 EO Mk2 FCR,” which are different from the sensors of the class’ first five vessels.

Vigile 100 is a fully digital radar electronic surveillance system that provides enhanced situational awareness, threat identification, and electronic intelligence gathering.

“Vigile is capable of monitoring multiple-overlapping signals maintaining 100 percent Probability of Intercept against all signals, regardless of types of power,” manufacturer Thales writes on its website.

“This means that signals of interest such as threat emitters are not masked by higher-power signals. This is essential for operation in the littoral region and with the introduction of multi-function radars, where many high-power, high duty cycle signals are present,” the company added.

STIR, meanwhile, is a medium-to-long range tracking and illumination radar system designed with “high accuracy, excellent performance and extensive electronic counter-countermeasures capabilities.”"
How Thales' Welsh cyber-centre is helping industry partners secure tomorrow's technologies - The Engineer,"Mon, 10 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVlbmdpbmVlci5jby51ay9jb250ZW50L2luLWRlcHRoL2hvdy10aGFsZXMtd2Vsc2gtY3liZXItY2VudHJlLWlzLWhlbHBpbmctaW5kdXN0cnktcGFydG5lcnMtc2VjdXJlLXRvbW9ycm93cy10ZWNobm9sb2dpZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"At a new ""cyber-range"" testing facility in Ebbw Vale, Wales, defence and aerospace giant Thales is helping industry partners secure their future technologies against the threat of cyber-attacks. Melissa Bradshaw reports.

Situated among the sprawling valleys in Ebbw Vale, South East Wales, the National Digital Exploitation Centre (NDEC) sits in the home of the town’s former steelworks site.

You could say this is a reasonably fitting location for a technology campus dedicated to protecting industry, considering its contribution to the industrial revolution. 34,000 people were employed at the Ebbw Vale Steel, Iron and Coal Company during its peak — but the steelworks suffered the hit of The Great Depression as the town’s industrial hub suffered liquidations and layoffs. Eventually, in 2002, it was closed down for good.

Instead, the site now hosts a ‘cyber range’ testing facility and education centre that serves to help secure the next-generation technologies that industry needs to thrive in an increasingly digital and automated world.

Cyber threats continue to evolve, increasing in sophistication as the ‘smart’ technologies we use in manufacturing and beyond continue to modernise. A report published last year by manufacturing industry body Make UK revealed that 47 per cent of Britain’s manufacturers had been the victim of cyber-crime in the previous 12 months, with 62 per cent revealing that cyber attacks had cost their business up to £5,000 — for 22 per cent, this rose to between £5,000 and £25,000.

Through its work alongside industry and academic institutions, NDEC wants to build a ‘cyber centre of excellence’ that can provide awareness and help implement the necessary measures to shield industry from attacks.

A £20m joint investment launched in 2019 by Thales, the Welsh government and the University of South Wales, NDEC works closely with manufacturing companies to secure automation systems used in industry, which are becoming increasingly complex and ‘intelligent’ in nature.

NDEC and Resilient Works' Ebbw Vale HQ -

Leanne Connor, business manager at Thales Ebbw Vale and NDEC explained that the centre was born out of a recognition that the cyber cluster in Wales was strong, therefore there was a big opportunity for Thales to establish a footprint as it had done in the rest of the UK.

“It started off with me as the first employee and now we’re up to about 20 people,” Connor said. She told The Engineer that cybersecurity in schools, as a career path, was low on the agenda, with very limited levels of knowledge for students.

“Our education work sets out to encourage teaching staff and students to consider the option of cybersecurity as a career path, because it cuts across such a spectrum of industries,” she said. “We’re now working with 100+ schools in South Wales and we’ve got activities [for students] from the ages of seven right the way through to PhD [level] ... we’ve got a continuum of activity to maintain that interest and build that skills and talent pipeline.

“The landscape is ever evolving and as an academic organisation, how you keep up with that I’m not sure — I think potentially more vocational learning will be required, because you’ll need to be in environments like this with real-life equipment, with the most recent threats, and it’ll have to be quite fluid in terms of industry and the cyber attacks of today. They’re becoming more and more sophisticated, we’ll need the R&D looking at the future and then how we’re dealing with the attacks now.”

The latest development to join NDEC at the site this year is the £7m ResilientWorks lab, jointly funded by Thales and the Welsh government’s Tech Valleys programme with a research contribution from Cardiff University.

ResilientWorks is aiming to provide a living laboratory where autonomous vehicle manufacturers and energy companies can test and develop their technology to strengthen its cyber ‘resilience’.

With a focus on connected autonomous vehicles (CAV) and critical national infrastructure (CNI), the development features research laboratories and an autonomous vehicle test track. Projects are exploring challenges including improving vehicle communications and location accuracy, resilience of battery management and vehicle-to-grid charging, training of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and simulation of Micro Grids.

Thales is working with autonomous vehicle specialists like Aurrigo to help secure the technology from hackers -

The concept of resilience is something that has always been embedded in engineering, said Kirsty Perrett, cyber network engineer at NDEC and a PhD student at the University of South Wales.

“Resilience is about the ability to adapt, evolve,” Perrett said. “Sometimes you have to be reactive to something, sometimes you have to be proactive, especially in systems engineering.

“Where things are moving so fast with digital technology and Industry 4.0, with all these interconnected assets, I think we think of it as something new. But it’s not something new, it’s something we would have done before. Resilience for me is just about moving forward.”

For manufacturing companies, this isn’t always such a big step, said Thales Ebbw Vale engineering manager Dene Yandle — often, it is the simple steps that can enable business continuity for the sector. Drawing on years of engineering and systems design experience in industries spanning automotive to nuclear, Yandle’s focus is now on how sectors such as these can become more robust in the face of threats.

“The big piece of the jigsaw that we now miss is how cyber impacts that resilience. What doors have now opened because we’ve got this massive explosion of data?”

He explained that there’s a lot of data in the manufacturing sector which ends up being forgotten about — we know what data exists in the IT sector, he pointed out, and we know that information is secured. But this information is replicated in the automation and operational technology (OT) segment, and no longer treated as securely as it is in the IT world.

“Something we’re working with companies to do is take their equipment, replicate it here physically, and then we can probe and prod it from a cybersecurity aspect,” Yandle said.

With this ‘ethical hacking’ capability, the facility can help companies prepare for the outcome of a potential cyber attack, gain awareness of what that could look like and how they can put devices and security around their technology to secure it from the outside, he explained.

One fairly recent example of how this cyber vigilance is absolutely crucial in the context of critical national infrastructure is the 2021 attack on a water treatment plant in Oldsmar, Florida. Having managed to remotely gain control of the plant’s software, a hacker with unknown motives made an attempt at increasing the levels of sodium hydroxide in the water supply from 100 parts per million to 11,100 parts per million — an increase that, had it been successful, would have been extremely dangerous to public health.

Thankfully, the attack was prevented and the action was quickly reversed by an operator who had picked up on the attempt. But news of the breach will have come as a stark reminder to engineers working in critical national infrastructure of the consequences that could arise from neglecting the security of their networks.

Rather than being a model in a simulation, as in a digital twin concept, cyber engineer Perrett explained that having that real physical connection to the company’s actual kit in a simulated capacity can allow for a higher probability of true fact — a digital twin isn’t exposed to environmental issues, she pointed out, such as an engineer plugging something into the machine without realising there’s malware on their USB.

Cybersecurity is a growing priority for manufacturers -

Without wanting to ‘scare’ people in the engineering sector, she said, the goal is simply to increase awareness of how cybersecurity practices can be embedded from the very beginning.

“We don’t want to prevent [people] from evolving or keep them behind, what we want to do is make them aware that complexity comes from interconnected systems, and the more systems you connect, the more links or possibilities you get,” she commented.

“We just need to rethink risk, to include security, not leave it out. Because security should be a friend of yours instead of the guy on the door not letting you in — it shouldn’t be an obstacle.

“Security and safety come in as friends, not seeing each other as enemies. As soon as they start working together you’ll see the digital transformation transforming better. We’ve got a real opportunity to get in now, because we’re at the forefront of digital transformation with companies willing to spend money to improve their efficiency and productivity.”"

EXCLUSIVE: Absconding Arms Agent Sanjay Bhandari Claims French Firm Promised €20mn for Defence Deal But Cheated Him - NewsClick,"Fri, 21 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzY2xpY2suaW4vRVhDTFVTSVZFLUFic2NvbmRpbmctQXJtcy1BZ2VudC1TYW5qYXktQmhhbmRhcmktQ2xhaW1zLUZyZW5jaC1GaXJtLVByb21pc2VkLSVFMiU4MiVBQzIwLW1uLURlZmVuY2UtRGVhbC1DaGVhdGVkLUhpbdIBkAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzY2xpY2suaW4vRVhDTFVTSVZFLUFic2NvbmRpbmctQXJtcy1BZ2VudC1TYW5qYXktQmhhbmRhcmktQ2xhaW1zLUZyZW5jaC1GaXJtLVByb21pc2VkLSVFMiU4MiVBQzIwLW1uLURlZmVuY2UtRGVhbC1DaGVhdGVkLUhpbT9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Gurugram, New Delhi and Bengaluru: The government of India is seeking the extradition of arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari on grounds of his alleged failure to declare his foreign assets under the Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act, 2015, and for alleged money laundering. Andrew Peretti reported from London for NewsClick that closing arguments in the extradition case were heard at the Westminster Magistrates’ Court, London, on October 4 and a final decision is expected on November 7.

The Thales Group – a French multinational conglomerate that designs, develops and manufactures electrical systems, as well as devices and equipment for the aerospace, defence, transportation and security sectors, including the Rafale aircraft – has been accused by Bhandari of not paying him the “commission” that had been agreed upon. Thales SA has denied the allegation. The French government owns 25.67% of the equity capital of Thales, while Dassault Aviation (the manufacturer of Rafale) has a 24.62% stake in the company. Thales is also one of several offset partners in the Rafale deal.

Backdrop to the Controversy

According to a January 9, 2022 article in the London, UK-based publication, The Telegraph, Bhandari alleged that “he was hired by Thales to secure a €2.4 billion contract to upgrade Mirage 2000 military jets for the Indian Air Force” that was signed in 2011. He claims he helped Thales to sell the contract for the upgrade of the Mirage jets by facilitating a meeting with a top official of India’s Ministry of Defence.

Bhandari filed a lawsuit in a commercial court near Paris alleging that while Thales had agreed to pay a consultancy fee of €20 million to him, he was paid only €9 million.

The Telegraph report said Bhandari had alleged that he was not paid his dues due to “political factors,” namely, his proximity to the Congress party and that from 2016 onward, the Bharatiya Janata Party government in New Delhi led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi “started persecuting him.” More about Bhandari’s alleged links with the Congress party will come a bit later.

The British publication wrote that “the allegations that will emerge during Mr Bhandari’s case against Thales could embarrass the French defence industry which has close ties to the government (in Paris).” It added that Bhandari has claimed in his petition that “he was told by François Dupont, then managing director of Thales India, about an elaborate covert … scheme in India and Dubai which enabled the payment of secret commissions to intermediaries… This arrangement was presented as being a standard practice within the Thales group for the payment of commercial intermediation services, taking into account the regulations in force in France.”

Complex Corporate Structure

The Telegraph report by Mark Hollingsworth claimed that a “special subsidiary called Thales Middle East and Africa” allegedly handled the “financial structures” and the executives involved included the president of Thales Air Systems, Guy Delevacque, and Dupont.

The report added: “Initially, it was agreed with India that as part of the Mirage 2000 modernisation contract, Thales would set up a technology transfer (scheme) that would benefit local Indian industry. A part of the funds received was to be earmarked for this purpose. But these funds were in fact mainly used by Thales to make indirect payments to middlemen who were lobbying foreign governments, the lawsuit claims.”

Bhandari’s petition further alleges that in order to pay the commissions to him, Thales awarded offset contracts to two companies based in Bengaluru that would retain a quarter of the price paid by Thales for services that could materialise in engineering or consulting. The remaining amount would allegedly be paid to a Dubai-based company called UHY Saxena Consulting. He claimed that the company did not, in fact, provide any services to Thales other than receiving the payment of the fees due to Bhandari and transferring the funds to the designated accounts.

Bhandari’s petition, quoted by The Telegraph, a copy of which is with the authors of this article, claims that this “fictitious economic justification constructed by Thales also involved the conduct of an audit by the UK firm Ernst & Young.” He alleged that on February 14, 2019, Pierre-Marie Budin (who succeeded Dupont in Thales) told him that the intermediary company involved in the financing package would be audited by Ernst & Young in order to “protect everyone.”

The Telegraph quoted an unnamed spokesperson for Thales denying Bhandari’s allegations. “Thales firmly denied the claims by Bhandari regarding the sums allegedly due or any other payments to him by Thales SA. Thales never signed a contract with Mr Bhandari or his companies in connection with this project. Thales complies with the law and applies a zero-tolerance policy on corruption and influence peddling. The Group’s integrity programme is regularly evaluated and amended to reflect changes in applicable legislation and best practices.”

A source close to Bhandari was also quoted in The Telegraph report claiming: “Bhandari helped Thales win the Mirage upgrade deal. But Thales—a powerful multinational—sacrificed (its) former partner on the altar of Indian domestic politics and reneged on their side of the bargain. It’s a David versus Goliath, but we know who won that fight in the end.”

The report ends with a reference to the supplier of Rafale aircraft: “This shows how French defence companies like Dassault and Thales are neck deep into corruption and their use of illegitimate business practices and offshore companies to pay their middlemen and bribe officials in other countries to secure big defence contracts.”

Bhandari reportedly fled India despite a “look-out” notice being issued against him following a search-and-seizure raid on his residence by officials of the Income Tax Department in October 2016 where “confidential” documents of the Defence Ministry were found that indicated a possible violation of the Official Secrets Act.

According to a report in The Times of India by Naomi Canton, published on September 2, 2020, Bhandari had brokered a Rs 2,895 crore contract with Swiss aircraft company Pilatus Aircraft Limited that had paid his Dubai company, Offset India Solutions FZC, and had also received “kickbacks” for a Rs 6,744 crore petroleum industry deal obtained by South Korea’s Samsung Engineering Company Limited in Gujarat.

Attempts to Extradite Bhandari: Political Angle

After Bhandari was arrested in London on July 15, 2020, he was released on bail by the Westminster Magistrates’ court on payment of £120,000 (or the equivalent of Rs 1.1 crore) and a series of stringent conditions were imposed on him. The conditions included surrendering his passport, wearing an electronic tag, not leaving his residence, a curfew between 10.00 pm and 6.00 am, not switching off his mobile phone, visiting the local police station twice a week, and not visiting any international port and not applying for, or being in possession of, any travel document.

The ToI quoted a court spokesperson saying that the charges against Bhandari related to him “knowingly” evading payment of income tax between April 2016 and September 2019. The news-report then brought in the angle of Bhandari being allegedly involved in property deals in London with Robert Vadra, husband of Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, adding that Robert Vadra had denied any business association with Bhandari.

A source confirmed to the principal author of this article that Bhandari was well aware of the details of the Rafale deal involving the Indian government and Dassault Aviation. If correct, what the allegations levelled by Bhandari reveal are the complex “layering” of transactions by arms merchants and their dealings with so-called brokers or intermediaries.

According to several media reports, including one in the Economic Times dated January 11, 2022, and another in The Telegraph, UK, Bhandari filed a suit against Thales at the Tribunal de Commerce in Nanterre, France, wherein he repeats several allegations against Thales made by him in the UK court, namely, that

● Thales did not pay him €11 million out of €20 million that was supposed to be his fee for services as a commercial intermediary representing Thales in the Mirage modernisation deal.

● that he was told by a Thales India official about an elaborate financial covert scheme in India and Dubai which enabled the payment of secret commissions to intermediaries, and;

● that the two companies based in Bengaluru that were awarded offset contracts “would retain about 25 per cent of the price paid by Thales for services that could materialise in engineering or consulting.”

Link with Rajeev Chandrasekhar’s Firm?

Court documents suggest that one of the “two companies based in Bangalore” is Axiscades Engineering Technologies Limited, which is promoted by Jupiter Capital, which, in turn, was promoted by Rajeev Chandrasekhar, the Minister of State for Electronics and Information Technology. At the time the companies were promoted, Chandrasekhar was not a Union minister. He was a Director of Jupiter Capital between 2005 and 2020 and he became a minister in 2021. During the time the Thales deal took place, Chandrasekhar was a member of the Rajya Sabha.

Bhandari has alleged that Axiscades, “headed by Sudhakar Ganje, is indirectly owned by Mr ... Chandrasekhar, an Indian politician and member of the upper house of Parliament in India.” The allegations levelled by Bhandari are yet to be proven. His allegations have also been published in a report on a portal, Intelligence Online, on October 17.

Bhandari has alleged in the commercial court in France that Axiscades was awarded an offset contract by Thales and retained 25% of the value of the contract. Further, he has alleged that a Dubai-based consulting company, named UHY Saxena Consulting, headed by Rajeev Saxena, was supposed to pay him part of his fee but did not. “The purpose of concluding these cascade contracts was to facilitate the transit of funds from Thales to the accounts of Mr. Sanjay Bhandari,” he has alleged in the French court.

Bhandari has further claimed that using the financial structure of which Axiscades is a part, Thales has paid a portion of the €20 million due to him for his services as a commercial intermediary amounting to €9 million.

That Thales was a client of Axiscades and its predecessor companies, and that Axiscades was an offset partner for the Mirage modernisation deal, is well documented.

Rajiv Shamsher Bahadur Saxena (also known as Rajeev Saxena) of UHY Saxena Consulting and his wife Shivani Saxena were arrested in 2019 by the Directorate of Enforcement in the Ministry of Finance in connection with the case relating to purchase of 12 helicopters for very, very important persons (VVIPs) from AgustaWestland, a British-Italian company.

The question is whether Chandrasekhar was aware of the interconnections of the accused people in these transactions at the time he was still a Director of Jupiter Capital. The principal writer of this article sent the Minister detailed messages on both his official email address as well as his personal email addresses on September 30. A reminder was sent on October 17. This report will be updated as and when we receive a response from Chandrasekhar.

Will Bhandari’s Allegations Stick?

In his petition, Bhandari has alleged that Thales’ Pierre-Marie Durand told him on February 20, 2019, that funds would get routed through AvioHelitronics and Axiscades to UHY Saxena Consultancy in Dubai and then to Bhandari’s designated accounts, in the following manner: AvioHeli €6.2 million, Axiscades €3.8 million and UHY Saxena Consulting €1.2 million. These amounts were apparently never paid.

Rajeev Saxena was deported from the United Arab Emirates to India on January 19, 2019, and arrested the same day. This was exactly a month before the communication between Bhandari and Durand allegedly took place.

Will Bhandari Be Extradited?

NewsClick has already reported from London that as far as extradition trials go, the case relating to Bhandari has not elicited the fanfare of high-profile names like Vijay Mallya or Nirav Modi. Interpol’s website currently shows no red notice against Bhandari, although fugitive diamantaire Nirav Modi is listed on the site. In 2017, Interpol had refused to issue a red notice, after a case had been lodged against Bhandari under the Official Secrets Act. At that time, Interpol had stated that the rejection was due to the case appearing to be of a “political nature.”

As Peretti commented in his article published in this portal, Bhandari’s case goes beyond politics and is significant from a legal perspective that would test the provisions of the Black Money Act, 2015, enacted by Modi government to curb flows of black money and undisclosed foreign assets.

Bhandari’s lawyers have sought to put the spotlight on a report by the United Nations Human Rights Council Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, that had outlined the treatment of Christian Michel, who was extradited to India on allegations that he organised bribes in exchange for a 2007 contract for the purchase of luxury helicopters from AgustaWestland. Michel is currently behind bars in Delhi’s Tihar Jail.

The StrikeMaster combines Thales Australia’s familiar armoured single-cab Bushmaster protected mobility vehicle with Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace’s (KDA) Naval Strike Missile (NSM) Coastal Defence System .

According to Thales the marriage of the two provides the Australian Defence Force with a potent, disruptive and proven land-based maritime deterrent.

With a range of more than 250km, the NSM has the ability to penetrate the defence systems of its primary target, heavily armed modern combat ships of opposing navies.

Arriving in Australia mid-year, the NSM modules were taken to Bendigo. where they were fitted to on a waiting Bushmaster utility vehicle.

Dubbed by Thales as ‘the darling of the ADF’s armoured vehicle fleet’, Bushmaster has seen service in Afghanistan and, most lrecently in Ukraine.

Royal Navy looking to quickly upgrade sonar on frigates - UK Defence Journal,"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdWtkZWZlbmNlam91cm5hbC5vcmcudWsvcm95YWwtbmF2eS1sb29raW5nLXRvLXF1aWNrbHktdXBncmFkZS1zb25hci1vbi1mcmlnYXRlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Ministry of Defence is currently seeking options as potential capability upgrades for Sonar 2087, a low-frequency active and passive ‘Variable Depth Sonar’ found on Type 23 Frigates.

The upgrade project is being carried out under the ‘Spearhead Initiative’, the Ministry of Defence say that this initiative “seeks to combine emerging technological solutions with innovative acquisition practices to solve real-world military problems much more quickly than traditional processes would allow”.

Sonar 2087 is a towed array sonar designed and manufactured by Thales at sites in the UK and in France. Sonar 2087 replaces the older Sonar 2031 in the Royal Navy and equips eight Type 23 frigates. The system is also expected to equip the Royal Navy’s future Type 26 Frigates. It is a Low Frequency Active Sonar and consists of both active and passive sonar arrays. Thales describes the system as “a towed-array that enables Type 23 frigates to hunt the latest submarines at considerable distances and locate them beyond the range at which they [submarines] can launch an attack.”

According to an official pre-procurement notice document relating to the upgrade project, the vision statement for “Spearhead Capability Insertion Project for Sonar 2087” is as follows:

“S2087 Capability insertion shall deliver the RN’s key surface ASW sensor for the T23 FFTA. S2087 shall provide persistent operational advantage in the North Atlantic against peer/near peer capability until at least the mid-2030s.

It shall furthermore deliver the persistent ASW sensor to the MTG and shall support pervasive awareness particularly in the North Atlantic through interoperability with other sensing platforms/units and C2 nodes. S2087 Capability insertion will support persistent detection and cuing and combined arms prosecution.

It should deliver a Human Computer Interface (HCI) that is intuitive to operators of all levels of experience and supports maximum flexibility of manning through use of appropriate stimuli to alert watch standers of fleeting SM contacts.”

The aim of the project

The intended outcomes of this project are as follows.

1) Increased lethality of ASW platforms and associated effectors.

2) Improved detection, tracking, prosecution and networking of sensors and platforms.

3) Improved shared awareness of maritime platforms delivering ASW.

4) Improved data handling and analysis.

5) Transforming defence acquisition by delivering increased capability to the front line as

soon as equipment becomes available.

6) Improved UK Prosperity by promoting defence exports.

The pre-procurement notice states that an “Industry Day” will be held to brief on the Spearhead process and provide opportunities for industry/academia to participate.

“The date and venue for this event will be published in due course (currently expected to be 5th December 2022 at HMS Collingwood, Gosport, but may be subject to change).”

NZDF explores C4I options for new Bushmasters - Australian Defence Magazine,"Thu, 20 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5kZWZlbmNlLmNvbS5hdS9kZWZlbmNlL2M0aS1ldy9uemRmLWV4cGxvcmVzLWM0aS1vcHRpb25zLWZvci1uZXctYnVzaG1hc3RlcnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In preparation for the impending delivery of Thales Bushmaster NZ5.5 vehicles, the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) has begun to explore how it will integrate Command, Control, Communication, Computing and Intelligence systems (C4I) into the new vehicles.

According to the Request for Information (RFI), released September 30, the vehicles will need to be outfitted with standard equipment being procured through Tranche One of New Zealand’s Network Enabled Army (NEA) program. NEA is an ongoing NZDF effort to modernise the New Zealand Army’s C4I capabilities, through the acquisition of new radios, drones and battle management systems (BMS).

All of the necessary C4I equipment is expected to be mounted on an internal flexible tray which will be common across most variants. However, both the command and control (C2) and medical evacuation-type vehicles will have slightly different internal makeups, necessitating different mounting solutions. The C2 variant is fitted with a larger tray to accommodate a forward communications access node (FACN) while, due to the need to accommodate a stretcher, the medical variants systems are permitted to be mounted forward in the cabin.

In total, New Zealand is procuring 43 Bushmasters across five variants: Maintenance, Troop Carrier, Command and Control, Medical Evacuation and Logistics.

The RFI stipulates that all of the vehicles will be fitted for, but not necessarily with, wiring and electronics to accommodate a full suite of battlefield radios, including L3Harris’ AN/PRC-158, AN/PRC-160 and AN/PRC-163. A doubly-redundant GPS, mounted in dual antennas, is also part of the requirements. The design solution should also leave room for any future active electronic warfare or anti-improvised explosive device (IED) systems that the New Zealand Army may choose to install.

All of the mounted systems are expected to integrate with a range of possible future additions to the vehicles, including a remote weapons system (RWS), counter-unmanned aerial vehicle platform (C-UAS), or shot-detection sensors.

New Zealand is scheduled to receive its first Bushmaster NZ5.5s from Thales Australia later this year. The RFI accordingly notes that the Army will likely procure a basic interim communications solution, pending the rollout of the fully-operational system. This will allow the service to commence basic driver, crew and maintainer training, while it cycles Bushmaster vehicles through C4I integration and testing with its selected partner.

The RFI states that the expected life of the vehicles and their subsystems is 20 years, which is less than the 30-plus years originally by the New Zealand Ministry of Defence.

The RFI closes November 4 2022 with information gathered expected to inform a final submission to government, ahead of a formal request for tender (RFT)."
Lockheed Martin Australia to open new facility at Mulwala to accelerate the development and production of Australia’s ... - Australian Manufacturing,"Thu, 06 Oct 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdXN0cmFsaWFubWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy5jb20uYXUvbG9ja2hlZWQtbWFydGluLWF1c3RyYWxpYS10by1vcGVuLW5ldy1mYWNpbGl0eS1hdC1tdWx3YWxhLXRvLWFjY2VsZXJhdGUtdGhlLWRldmVsb3BtZW50LWFuZC1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLW9mLWF1c3RyYWxpYXMtZ3VpZGVkLXdlYXBvbnMtY2FwYWJpbGl0aWVzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Media Release by Lockheed Martin Australia

Lockheed Martin Australia has announced it will open a new facility in partnership with Thales Australia in Mulwala, NSW.

The Mulwala site is intended to support the Australian Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance (GWEO) Enterprise in the development and production of various manufacturing activities.

James Heading, Lockheed Martin Australia’s Director of Programs Strategic Capabilities Office for Missiles and Fire Control, welcomed the establishment of the new facility.

“Lockheed Martin Australia and Thales Australia have unique and complementary backgrounds and expertise in the manufacture and delivery of weapons capabilities that together will provide further impetus for the Australian Government’s objective of expanding the national defence industrial and manufacturing capability.

It will bring Australia a step closer to a national guided weapons capability as well as set us up for potential future export of Australian manufactured products.” Mr Heading said.

Thales Australia currently manages the Commonwealth-owned facility at Mulwala and has made a significant investment in state-of-the-art advanced manufacturing equipment at the site.

Thales Australia’s Chief Executive, Jeff Connolly, said, “We are committed to investing in the industrial capability and technology necessary to support the Australian Defence Force (ADF) and the Australian Government’s ambition to accelerate the creation of a Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance Enterprise, boosting skilled jobs and helping secure Australia’s national defence capabilities.”

The Mulwala site is the first co-located presence for Lockheed Martin in Australia. Mr Heading said, “We have also commenced work to identify other potential industrial sites and are positioning to have sustained in-country manufacturing and strong partnerships in place as soon as possible”.

“We have a proud history of successfully developing and delivering world class capabilities to our customers. The opportunity to partner with the team at Thales Australia, the operator of the Government Munitions facility at Mulwala, with a successful track record of delivering ammunition, propellants, explosives and related services has the makings of a great partnership for the future.” Mr Heading said."
