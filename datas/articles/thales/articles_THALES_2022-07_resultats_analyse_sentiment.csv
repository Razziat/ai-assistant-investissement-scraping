The activity follows approval for satellite-driven 5G non-terrestrial networks (5G NTNs) from the 3GPP global telecommunications standards’ body

5G non-terrestrial networks could help to provide complete global 5G coverage – including areas currently not served by terrestrial networks

This initial work in France would be to test and validate 5G NTN to gain leverage from the satellite and ICT ecosystem ​





After having each conducted detailed research which included multiple studies and simulations, the parties plan to enter smartphone-use-case-focused testing and validation of 5G non-terrestrial networks (5G NTN).

The result could effectively mean that a future 5G smartphone could use 5G connectivity anywhere on Earth and provide complete global coverage for wideband data services, including places normally only covered by legacy satellite phone systems with limited data connectivity capabilities.

The benefits of 5G connectivity via low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are expected to include coverage in extreme geographies or remote areas across seas, oceans and other locations where terrestrial coverage is absent.

Such widespread connectivity would boost 5G smartphone subscriber roaming service capabilities, as well as enabling global connectivity for transportation, energy, and health sector 5G use cases. ​

The space-based network could also be used as back-up support to terrestrial networks in the event of major network outages or disasters.

The expected security capabilities of 5G NTNs mean that national government communications may be a main use case, to enhance safe and secure national security and public safety government networks.

Erik Ekudden, Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, Ericsson, says: “This testing and validation cooperation between Ericsson, Thales and Qualcomm Technologies will be a major milestone in the history of communications as the ultimate result could effectively mean that no matter where you are on Earth – in the middle of an Ocean or the remotest forest – high-end, secure and cost-effective connectivity will be available through collaborative 5G satellite and terrestrial connectivity.”

John Smee, senior vice president of engineering, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., says: “For 5G to fulfill on the promise of ubiquitous connectivity, it is imperative that it can also deliver network coverage in areas where terrestrial cellular networks do not exist, whether that be over oceans or in remote areas. Our planned research with Ericsson and Thales will kick off an important step in making this vital technology a reality. We are looking forward to what this collaboration can accomplish.”

Philippe Keryer, Executive Vice-President, Strategy, Research and Technology, Thales says: “The deployment of 5G networks marks a step change for the telecoms industry. It is a game changer, not only in terms of business opportunities but also in the skills required to connect and protect billions of people and things. Thales is deeply involved in it through the different activities of the Group. ​ The research collaboration with Ericsson and Qualcomm Technologies will demonstrate the belief of our companies that 5G non-terrestrial Networks will contribute to this revolution and will take network resiliency and security to the next level. “



​The Cooperation

The testing and validation by Ericsson, Thales and Qualcomm Technologies following the March 2022 go-ahead by 3GPP – the global telecommunications standards’ body – is intended to support non-terrestrial networks for the first time.

The goal of the testing will be to validate various technology components needed to enable 5G non-terrestrial networks, including a 5G smartphone, satellite payload and 5G network pieces on the ground.

This work also aims to validate that 5G NTN can be supported in a smartphone form factor allowing tomorrow’s 5G smartphone to effectively become a satellite-phone. Initial tests will take place in an emulated space environment in France, where the majority of European space-focused industry is based. ​

Ericsson plans to verify a 5G virtual RAN (vRAN) stack, modified to handle radio signals propagating (what happens to 5G radio waves travelling through the vacuum of space and the Earth’s atmosphere) via the fast-moving LEO satellites.

Thales plans to verify a 5G radio satellite payload suitable for deployment on LEO satellites, while Qualcomm Technologies plans to provide test phones verifying that 5G NTN can be accessed by future 5G smartphones.

Experts will use ground-based equipment to emulate the 5G radio propagation and time delays between an equipped satellite in orbit and connecting a 5G smartphone with the 5G radio access network at different places on the earth’s surface. ​

Ekudden adds: “While it is too early to say when any resulting 5G equipped prototype satellite could be launched into orbit for real operational use, the highly technical ground-based testing and validation work planned between Ericsson, Thales and Qualcomm Technologies is key to making it happen.”

As a 3GPP-backed technology, 5G NTNs will be able to capitalize on a large ecosystem of standardized products and components. The new specification also enables the inclusion of NTN technologies in 5G devices, providing opportunities for technology vendors to easily and quickly scale 5G NTN compatibility across devices.

Thales Expands Cybersecurity Portfolio With OneWelcome Acquisition - Dark Reading,"Fri, 22 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhcmtyZWFkaW5nLmNvbS9jeWJlci1yaXNrL3RoYWxlcy1leHBhbmRzLWN5YmVyc2VjdXJpdHktcG9ydGZvbGlvLXdpdGgtb25ld2VsY29tZS1hY3F1aXNpdGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Last week, Thales announced that it had the signature of an agreement to acquire OneWelcome, a European leader in the fast-growing market of customer identity and access management (CIAM), for a total consideration of €100 million. Thales aims to capitalize on OneWelcome's strong cloud-native software-as-a-service (SaaS) product by extending its market footprint beyond Europe and selling it to existing Thales clients in North America and the Asia-Pacific region.

Complementary Identity Acquisition

OneWelcome's strong digital identity life-cycle management capabilities will complement Thales's existing identity services (secure credential enrollment, issuance and management, know your customer etc.). With this acquisition, Thales will be able to provide an expanded identity platform that will:

Be accessible to organizations of all sizes to manage internal and external identities

Quickly bring new businesses online

Improve operational efficiency and customer experience

Meet or exceed regulatory compliance requirements

It does look like CIAM is disappearing as a stand-alone pillar and is becoming a major pillar within larger vendors expanding cybersecurity portfolios. In addition to Thales' acquisition of OneWelcome, other notable ones include:

Ping Identity acquired Unbound ID in 2016.

SAP bought Gigya for $350 million in 2017.

Akamai acquired Janrain in 2019.

CIAM of Interest to Technology Vendors in Various Sectors

It's interesting that these acquisitions don't follow a pattern. Thales is arguably the biggest vendor in data security with its encryption capabilities. Ping was already a significant player in enterprise identity management/IDaaS before it added CIAM, and SAP, of course, has a huge enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM) business. And Akamai is a content delivery network (CDN) that has been expanding its security offerings for the best part of a decade.

What they have in common, however, is that the acquirers all serve enterprise customers who deal with large numbers of customers in the consumer market and their interactions with them have moved increasingly online, making CIAM a vital part of their security toolkit. Think of CIAM as the place where identity management (IAM and IDaaS) meets CRM, enabling consumers to access online resources and learning from their behaviors to improve their experience and, hopefully, to drive more sales.

Data Security and CIAM Convergence

Thales is a major player in the data security space and the acquisition of OneWelcome helps it expand its identity portfolio.

It does seem that an increasing number of vendors are wanting to play in the identity space. Only last month, Microsoft expanded its capabilities in identity with the launch of Entra. The good growth potential of CIAM and clamor by big vendors to enter this space can help to explain why Omdia projects this market to increase from $8.1 billion in 2021 to $16.7 billion in 2026.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999971389770508}",positive,0.9999971389770508,1

Thales – the duplicitous French defense giant - Yahoo News,"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vdGhhbGVzLWR1cGxpY2l0b3VzLWZyZW5jaC1kZWZlbnNlLWdpYW50LTE1MDAwMDQ5Mi5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales’s communication team is responding along two lines. First, they set up S3NS – a new enterprise, partnering with Google – to provide the French government with cloud computing services and sensitive data storage. The second one relates to a new line of UAVs, which will be used to monitor certain security issues.

This sequence of press releases aims to counter the negative PR fallout from two scandals, which have been rather damaging to the image of the company and France itself. After all, the French government remains Thales’ largest shareholder (25.67%). Another 24.62% belongs to Dassault Aviation, which is affiliated not only with the Dassault family (we’ll talk about them later), but also with Airbus S.E. Airbus is lobbying hard against any further Russian sanctions. The Dassault connection is rather plain: Dassault Aviation manufactured French war planes for decades, and was founded by Marcel Dassault, who was a two-term French Senator, with direct influence over state defense policy. It’s little wonder then that any negative PR reflects poorly on the old European elites, making them rather uncomfortable at very time they have been caught getting fat on Putin’s blood money.

Thales is a huge, diversified enterprise with a dozen subsidiaries. We will focus only on a selection of those: Thales E-Security, Sofradir, and Lynred.

Scandal the first – a military one

After Russian troops withdrew from Bucha, near Kyiv, in March 2022, it has emerged their tanks were equipped with Catherine thermal visors – one of Thales’ flagship products. According to the company’s website, these devices make it possible to engage the enemy at greater ranges, providing “a first strike” advantage.

Thales

Ukrainian volunteer Pavlo Kashchuk discovered a modern Thales visor, installed on a Russian APC, abandoned near Kyiv. The vehicle in question was upgraded in 2016 – well after 2014 EU sanctions on Russia, which banned dual-use technology exports to Moscow.

“The most interesting bit is the fire control system, which allows for accurate fire under any weather conditions and at any time of day,” said Kashchuk.

“The components and technology for this system had been transferred to russia by the French company Thales. The Catherine FC – a thoroughly non-Russian (product) name – thermal visor allows the enemy to spot their victim from several kilometers away. It is allegedly assembled at a Russian factory in Vologda, under a (French) license – following French blueprints and using French components. It’s but one of the schemes under which Western companies can circumvent existing embargoes and supply russia with cutting-edge military technologies. Naturally, their governments are complicit by turning a blind eye to this.”

Thales

Kashchuk’s YouTube channel has another video, where a modern russian thermal visor, manufactured sometime after 2019, is shown to contain components made by other French companies (Ulis and Safran). As it turns out, Thales’ subsidiary, Sofradir merged with Ulis in 2019, establishing Lynred. Lynred, in turn, is owned by Thales (50%) and Safran (50%).

Once all this became public, French and international investigators started looking into Thales.

Thales

Disclose – a non-profit investigative journalism organization – discovered that France issued 76 export licenses for military- and dual-use goods since 2015. These include thermal visors and avionics, worth EUR 152 million ($158 million). This figure was corroborated by Investigate Europe, and puts France in an awkward position of being responsible for 44% of European weapon exports to russia – the very same weapons that are now used against Ukraine. According to Disclose, France has supplied thermal visors for over 1,000 Russian tanks, on top of navigation systems and infrared sensors for russian fighter jets and helicopters.

As for Sifradir, it has been established that while it still was a subsidiary of Thales, it supplied russian companies Linkos and GIPO with 83 S24 infrared sensors, 258 S02 infrared detectors, and 138 S10 infrared sensor, in 2016 alone. GIPO is the Russian state-owned Institute of Applied Optics, which was

Prior to February 2022, none of this really mattered; these were simply the efforts by the French government and elite to skirt around sanctions to earn some cash. Not to mention, the French are almost clear of any wrongdoing, legally. While the Council Regulation (EU) No. 833/2014 forbids dual-use exports to Russia, it provides for national governments granting export licenses to fulfill existing contract obligations. To make use of this loophole, Thales kept extending its old contracts with Russia, which made it possible to keep the shipments going.

Thales

We’re certain this is but the tip of the iceberg when it comes to military ties between France and Russia. But this is already enough to explain why French President Emmanuel Macron kept calling Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, and implored everyone else to help Putin “save face.” Turns out, it would have allowed France – or at least its defense sector – to save face, too.

And while perhaps we could go easy on France, as it provides Ukraine with heavy weapons, we can’t Thales get off lightly. Polish EMPs were once again at the forefront, when they started asking in March why French companies are breaking with EU sanctions so brazenly.

Scandal the second – a banking one

Oleksandr Dubilet,

Chairman of the Board of Privatbank (1997-2016), banking and finance expert

Last week, Thales finally announced it was cutting ties with russia. This was made possible by the combined efforts of Ukrainian volunteers and Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry. Volunteers gathered the necessary evidence, while our diplomats brought the issue to international attention.

It’s worth noting that the announcement came on the day Macron visited Kyiv, where he pledged France’s unequivocal support of Ukraine.

But Thales, being as they are, still found a way to mess it all up.

A recently leaked internal report by the russian Alfa-Bank stated that the russian banking sector is hurtling towards a disaster, after Thales E-Security closed its Russia operations. Turns out, the security of credit cards, belonging to 100 million customers could be in jeopardy.

report of the russian Alfa-Bank

An investigation by Le Parisien similarly claimed that russian banks worry about Thales leaving the market: Thales solutions PayShield 9000 and PayShield 10K HSM are apparently critical to securing transactions via cards issued by Alfa-Bank, Sberbank, and VTB.

The announcement ended up being nothing but hot air. Thales quickly reassured its russian customers that their banking security products will continue operating normally. Leaving russia, it seems, is not going to happen after all.

This is the exact message that was passed to Russian banks: “Political manipulations cannot and should not affect the level, quality, stability, and effectiveness of our products and services, including on the Russian market. We will continue to ensure full operational capacity of our hardware products.” Cutting ties somehow transformed into “political manipulations.”

Thales

Ukrainian blogger and activist Anton Shvets summed it all up this way:

“If Thales instantly turned everything off, Russian banking would have collapsed. Russian banks operating normally indicates that (Thales) Group continues working for them. 80% of Russian banks use their services, and 100% – in occupied Ukrainian territories.”

What’s next? Plenty of evidence has emerged since Feb. 24, suggesting that European sanctions against Russia aren’t effective. Without tangible enforcement, they are entirely symbolic. Experts agree that in order to isolate Russia and curtail its economic ties with the rest of the world, sanctions breaches should be publicized, and responsible parties held legally accountable. First of all, evidence of companies skirting sanctions must be gathered. With Thales, it all began when photos of the captured russian APC began circulating on social media. Once public, this information allowed lawyers to start thoroughly investigating the company. It’s also crucial to pass all the findings to relevant EU bureaucratic bodies and law enforcement. Depending on jurisdiction, breaching sanctions could even be considered a criminal offense.

Ukraine currently enjoys unprecedented global support in its defense against the russian invasion. Our lawyers, together with various state agencies, have a unique chance to finally bring to justice all those who dare to ignore European sanctions, and isolate the aggressor.

Thales Alenia Space and QinetiQ to pave the way for small multimission satellites in Very Low Earth Orbit - Space Ref,"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL3NwYWNlcmVmLmNvbS9zcGFjZS1jb21tZXJjZS90aGFsZXMtYWxlbmlhLXNwYWNlLWFuZC1xaW5ldGlxLXRvLXBhdmUtdGhlLXdheS1mb3Itc21hbGwtbXVsdGltaXNzaW9uLXNhdGVsbGl0ZXMtaW4tdmVyeS1sb3ctZWFydGgtb3JiaXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Alenia Space and QinetiQ Cooperation Thales Alenia Space

Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), and QinetiQ have signed a study contract with the European Space Agency to pave the way for small multi- mission satellites to operate in Very Low Earth Orbit (VLEO).

The Phase A/B1 study will advance the design of Skimsat demonstrator, a VLEO multi-mission (<300km) satellite that aims to significantly reduce the cost of Earth observation whilst increasing performance by operating at substantially lower altitudes. The highly modular, compact flexible satellite will capitalize on developments in high efficiency electrical propulsion to compensate for air drag.

The compact size of Skimsat will allow to be compatible with the launchers designed for small satellites with respect to dimensions, such as those currently being developed in the UK, to provide customers with substantially shorter lead times than traditional satellite launchers of similar capability.

The study is being led by Thales Alenia Space in the UK and QinetiQ Space team in Belgium and is funded under ESA’s Discovery Preparation and Technology Development (DPTD) activities. Payloads using the multi-mission Skimsat platform will be identified as part of the study for an In Orbit Demonstration to show applications in VLEO prior to the first commercial mission. This new initiative is fully included in the new space approach of Thales Alenia Space and reflects the company’s capability to address disruptive needs in partnership with smaller companies.

Andrew Stanniland commented: This important study for an In Orbit Demonstration in VLEO brings together the technical excellence from our pioneering teams based in the UK, working in close partnership with QinetiQ Space team in Belgium. The Skimsat concept is a revolutionary innovation that stands to completely change the Earth observation market by challenging the traditional use of high altitudes that avoid air drag and by creating a new business model for high resolution imaging by using short lifetime and lead time and thus offering the market the benefit of more cost effective satellites”

Based on MIPRONS’ proprietary technology, with the Italian patent being extended to 49 other countries, this miniaturized, high-thrust thruster will use a green, cost-effective propellant — water. An electrolysis process breaks down the water into hydrogen and oxygen, which are fed into the combustion chamber. Only loading water, the system would allow for faster maneuver times such as orbit-raising, de-orbiting and collision avoidance. Because the system is both compact and scalable, it can be used on all size satellites, from small to large.

The innovative MIPRONS concept also calls on 3D printing for a number of components. Purpose-designed for Thales Alenia Space’s satellites, this powerful and high-efficiency thruster will feature reduced weight and volume. Thales Alenia Space will guide thruster development to achieve a reliable, high-performance propulsion solution for small and medium satellites. Thales Alenia Space in Italy will support the environmental testing of the engineering model.

“We are very proud to team up with MIPRONS, which is gaining increasing international recognition, since our collaboration could well change the paradigm for space missions,” said Massimo Claudio Comparini, CEO of Thales Alenia Space in Italy. “This agreement confirms Thales Alenia Space’s strategy to play a pivotal role in new space initiatives, reflected in synergies generated with exciting new startups that catalyze the entire space ecosystem. We are always willing to tackle new challenges that emphasize the growing strategic importance of the space sector.”

“I am extremely proud of our agreement with Thales Alenia Space,” said Angelo Minotti, CEO and founder of MIPRONS. “It’s truly a privilege to earn the trust of one of the world’s largest space companies. Our project, although still in its early stages , clearly has the potential to define a new paradigm in space, and we will do everything we can to have the system up and running as soon as possible.”

Thales details French sovereign cloud joint venture with Google - DatacenterDynamics,"Mon, 04 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhdGFjZW50ZXJkeW5hbWljcy5jb20vZW4vbmV3cy90aGFsZXMtZGV0YWlscy1mcmVuY2gtc292ZXJlaWduLWNsb3VkLWpvaW50LXZlbnR1cmUtd2l0aC1nb29nbGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales has revealed more details about its sovereign cloud service joint venture with Google in France.

The newly-named company, S3NS, is majority-owned and controlled by Thales and will operate under French law, according to the defense giant.

S3NS will directly operate three data centers in France. Both data center availability and engineering assistance will be available this year already and the recruitment of engineers is due to begin soon.

“The S3NS offering is the best of both worlds: the agility and wide range of services of a cloud hyperscaler combined with the security and data protection of a cybersecurity leader. This step marks the beginning of a technological and industrial adventure which will engage all the French economic players attached to a trusted solution,” said Marc Darmon, EVP of Secure Communications and Information Systems at Thales.

S3NS will offer its “trusted cloud” solutions from the second half of 2024 and operate in compliance with the requirements of the “Trusted Cloud” label of France’s Information Systems Security Agency (ANSSI).

S3NS' first offering is ""Local control with S3NS,"" which will offer Google Cloud customers in France cloud services with added capabilities to localize clients’ data in France or in Europe. Customers will be able to restrict data access for administrative service and technical support solely to European Union locations. Cryptographic control of data access can be achieved with external encryption key management from S3NS.

Cyprien Falque, managing director of S3NS, said: “The creation of S3NS, progress on the definition of our Trusted Cloud offering and the availability of our 'Local controls with S3NS' is the result of many months of collaboration between Thales and the Google Cloud teams. This is a first step and a first milestone this year, before our future solution in compliance with the French 'Trusted Cloud' criteria, which we are working on in parallel.”

Thomas Kurian, CEO at Google Cloud, added: “We are very proud to support our partner Thales and its subsidiary S3NS and its first offering in the French market. This collaboration between our teams reflects on the one hand an understanding of the expectations related to digital sovereignty, and on the other hand a real technological trajectory.”

Google has announced that it was working with Deutsche Telekom to create a German Sovereign Cloud that provides Google Cloud services from infrastructure managed by T-Systems.

Last year Capgemini and Orange announced plans to establish a new cloud company known as Bleu to meet the stringent sovereignty requirements of the French state & critical infrastructure and resell Microsoft services. Orange, meanwhile, is moving most of its IT to Google Cloud.

There is also the Gaia-X federated data infrastructure initiative, which aims to create a framework for interoperable cloud services that meet European requirements and reduce dependency on large US-based providers.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9979019165039062}",neutral,0.9979019165039062,0
ESA funds Skimsat demonstrator study for VLEO - SpaceNews,"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9lc2EtZnVuZHMtc2tpbXNhdC1kZW1vbnN0cmF0b3Itc3R1ZHktZm9yLXZsZW8v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TAMPA, Fla. — The European Space Agency has awarded funds to develop a demonstrator for Skimsat, a small satellite platform designed to operate in very low Earth orbit (VLEO).

Europe’s Thales Alenia Space said July 19 it had secured 2.3 million euros ($2.4 million) in ESA funding to advance its design of a satellite capable of operating in orbit below 300 kilometers.

The funding includes an 800,000 euro study contract for a demonstrator that would use electrical propulsion to compensate for air drag at these low altitudes, which promise sharper resolutions for Earth observation applications.

The company secured the funds in partnership with QinetiQ, a British aerospace company planning to provide altitude and orbit control systems (AOCS), among other capabilities for the platform.

Their one-year study, led by Thales Alenia Space’s U.K. subsidiary and QinetiQ’s space division in Belgium, includes the selection of payloads for a future Skimsat mission.

Nigel Towers, head of sales strategy and marketing for Thales Alenia Space in the U.K., did not give a potential launch date for Skimsat, but said the study contract enables the companies to define the mission and platform concept.

The study funds were awarded under ESA’s Discovery Preparation and Technology Development (DPTD) activities, and Towers said via email that Skimsat also received approval for 1.5 million euros “for predevelopments.”

Skimsat “stands to completely change the Earth observation market,” according to Andrew Stanniland, CEO of Thales Alenia Space in the U.K.

Stanniland said in a statement that Skimsat challenges “the traditional use of high altitudes that avoid air drag” and will create a “new business model for high resolution imaging” through more cost-effective satellites.

Thales Alenia Space has previously secured funds for Skimsat from the British government as part of the platform’s role in the Quantum Accelerometer Climate Explorer (Q-ACE) mission.

Following the demonstrator, a Q-ACE consortium led by Thales Alenia Space’s British subsidiary plans to use Skimsat for a mission to measure the density of the Earth’s thermosphere to improve climate forecasts.

Q-ACE is also in very early stages of development and does not have a firm target launch date, Towers said.

VLEO, referring to orbits between 250 and 450 kilometers above the Earth’s surface, also promises speedier communications for operators able to compensate for air drag.

Multiple companies have been developing VLEO solutions amid growing interest from commercial players and national security agencies.

In May, SpaceX launched a satellite built by Blue Canyon Technologies for MIT Lincoln Laboratory in Lexington, Massachusetts, that aims to test operations in VLEO for several months.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999330043792725}",neutral,0.9999330043792725,0

The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has selected an algorithm developed with input from Thales engineers as a new post-quantum cryptography standard for digital signatures. The move marks a vital first step towards developing cybersecurity defences that can withstand attacks from future quantum computers.

Building defences against an as-yet non-existent weapon may sound like a daunting challenge. But this is precisely the prospect facing the global cybersecurity community with the imminent arrival of quantum computers – machines that take advantage of the laws of quantum physics to perform atomic-scale operations. These supercomputers, which could become a reality in the next two decades, promise to revolutionise a whole host of scientific fields – healthcare, meteorology, artificial intelligence and more – by processing data at a speed and scale that defies the imagination.

But for the cryptography experts tasked with keeping our data and systems secure, the advent of quantum computing poses a new kind of threat: many of our current encryption algorithms, including those that protect critical and strategic operations, will become obsolete overnight.

Thales has been working on post-quantum cybersecurity technologies for the past decade as a way to prepare for these emerging risks. Engineers at its cryptography laboratory in Gennevilliers have developed the Falcon signature algorithm, which the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recently selected as a new post-quantum standard.

According to Eric Brier, Chief Technology Officer for the Cyber Defence Solutions business line, this distinction is well-deserved recognition for the team’s hard work. But, as he explains, Falcon also represents the cornerstone of the next generation of cybersecurity defences.

There’s been a lot of speculation as to when the first quantum computers will appear. But let’s say it happened tomorrow. How would that alter the cybersecurity landscape as we know it?

Let’s start by making one thing clear: the algorithms that will power future quantum computers and threaten our current cryptographic systems already exist. They’ve been studied extensively and we know exactly how they work. It’s the machines themselves that are lacking. So this isn’t a theoretical issue – it’s an engineering problem. For argument’s sake, let’s imagine that we’d overcome this technological barrier and that, sometime tomorrow, a sufficiently large and stable quantum computer kicked into action and started attacking our existing cryptographic defences.

The impact would be huge. And it would be felt across all our secure information systems, starting with many of those that use the HTTPs protocol (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, an internet communication protocol that protects data integrity and confidentiality – ed.). It would upend our approach to cryptography, rendering around half of the algorithms we use on a daily basis utterly irrelevant.

Are all cryptographic defence systems vulnerable to quantum attacks?

No, although this new threat ultimately poses a risk to the entire security chain. There are basically two main kinds of encryption algorithms: symmetric and asymmetric. Estimates suggest that quantum computers could reduce the effectiveness of the secret keys used in symmetric encryption by half. In other words, these defences would be weakened but not entirely breached. But for asymmetric encryption, which uses public keys, the threat is far graver: quantum technology would break these algorithms, rendering them completely obsolete.

On this basis, it could be argued that switching to symmetric-only algorithms and doubling the length of the encryption keys would be the best way to protect ourselves against future attacks by quantum computers. Sadly, however, this isn’t a realistic option. Information systems across every sector and industry use both symmetric and asymmetric encryption, and it’s been that way for decades now.

Aside from being unworkable, this kind of radical change would have too great an impact. What’s more, public-key cryptography has numerous other advantages that make it indispensable to many information systems. So we need to completely rethink our approach to asymmetric encryption to counter the threat posed by quantum computers.

This is precisely what the NIST set out to do in 2017 when it launched a global challenge to set future post-quantum standards for public-key cryptographic algorithms. What was the thinking behind this initiative?

Every technology company on the planet uses cryptography to keep their systems secure, but not all organisations are able to hire in-house cybersecurity experts. That’s why they rely on secure algorithms that conform to international standards. So it seemed only right, given the emerging risks posed by quantum computing, to develop new standards for both hybrid cryptography (combining pre-quantum and post-quantum defence mechanisms – ed.) and post-quantum cryptography. It also seemed right for Thales, with its long history and recognised leadership in encryption technologies, to answer the NIST’s call.

How did the NIST selection process unfold?

Our team took part in a five-year competition that attracted 82 individual researchers and research groups from 25 countries. The aim of the challenge was to develop a standardised, quantum-resistant signature algorithm, which is the most common of the three types of public-key encryption technologies in use today. Designing this kind of algorithm meant thinking differently and finding new mathematical problems that are especially difficult to solve.

Falcon, our entry for the NIST challenge,[1] is based on lattice reduction using a Euclidean algorithm. Once the design stage was complete, Falcon and the other candidates were subjected to a “crash test” – a series of deliberate attacks by other members of the community. The three finalists were the algorithms that stood firmest against these attacks: CRYSTALS-Dilithium (another Euclidean lattice-reduction algorithm), SPHINCS+ (which uses hash-based signatures) and Falcon, which appealed to the NIST on account of its compact design and its compatibility with constrained systems. We’re especially proud of the fact that Falcon provides consistently high security even in physical systems with low processing power, such as embedded systems and energy meters.

Why is it important for Thales that Falcon has been selected as a new cryptography standard?

First of all, it underscores the quality of the work we’re doing and the meaningful contribution it can make. Emerging victorious in a crowded field and making it through such a cut-throat selection process wasn’t something that happened by chance. Perhaps more importantly, a post-quantum cryptographic standard represents a major leap forward for the entire cybersecurity industry. And for Thales, having a toolkit that includes this new algorithm – developed in-house and endorsed by the international scientific community – means we are even better placed to help our customers counter the threats posed by quantum computing.

In a recent position paper, France’s National Agency for Information Systems Security (ANSSI) recommended that IT security systems should transition to hybrid cryptography by 2025 and to post-quantum cryptography by 2030. So the selection of Falcon by the NIST comes at an opportune moment, allowing Thales to continue to lead from the front in the cybersecurity industry.

[1] Falcon was co-developed by Thales together with academic and industrial partners from France (University of Rennes 1, PQShield SAS), Switzerland (IBM), Canada (NCC Group) and the US (Brown University, Qualcomm). Thales was the only technology group serving the defence, aerospace and digital identity markets to take part in the NIST competition.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9947730898857117}",neutral,0.9947730898857117,0

Thales Alenia Space @ Farnborough International AirShow 2022 - Thales,"Mon, 18 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbmV3cy90aGFsZXMtYWxlbmlhLXNwYWNlLWZhcm5ib3JvdWdoLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwtYWlyc2hvdy0yMDIy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Alenia Space is really excited to come back to the Farnborough International AirShow, in the Space zone, 4 years after the last edition. From July 18th to 22nd, the company will be spotlighting its latest technologies in the fields of space exploration, environment monitoring and telecommunications.

Lunar Gateway in the spotlight

The Gateway lunar space station is one of the pillars in NASA’s Artemis program to return astronauts to the Moon. It will help us establish a permanent presence on the Moon and function as a waystation for future interplanetary missions. It will also support long-term exploration of the Moon, via regular shuttle flights. Another advantage of the Artemis program is that it will allow us to develop and test the systems and procedures needed to carry out crewed missions to Mars. We obviously need a spacecraft capable of carrying astronauts from the Moon to Mars. And that’s where NASA’s Orion comes into its own.

To better understand how Thales Alenia Space became a major contributor to the Gateway, let’s go back a few years. Our company has developed globally recognized expertise in space exploration, robotics and automated transport system. We built most of the habitable volume on the International Space Station, including the Cupola observation post and the structure for the Columbus lab. In addition, we built all pressurized modules for the ATV resupply vessels used in the past, and the current Cygnus. These spacecraft ferry food and water, fuel, spare parts, all types of equipment and scientific experiments to the different crews.

Because of this expertise, unrivaled in Europe, we were chosen by ESA as prime contractor for two pressurized modules in the Lunar Gateway, ESPRIT and I-HAB, and we also build the HALO pressurized module for Northrop Grumman. At the same time, Thales Alenia Space was chosen by Axiom Space to supply two pressurized modules for their commercial space station – with interiors designed by Philippe Starck! We also supplied the shell for the Bishop airlock from NanoRacks, the first commercial module of this type, which was mated to the ISS in December 2020. Building on this string of successes and our complementary solutions, Thales Alenia Space has become the world leader in orbital infrastructures and a pivotal player in new lunar exploration initiatives.

Environmental monitoring satellites to safeguard our planet

Ericsson, Qualcomm and French aerospace company Thales announced a collaboration to test and develop 5G connectivity using low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations. The companies said that in order to determine the feasibility of such an endeavor, they have conducted a series of studies and simulations, and now, are prepared to begin smartphone use case testing and validation of the 5G non-terrestrial networks (5G NTN).

According to Ericsson, such a project could lead to “global coverage for wideband data” when using a 5G smartphone. Because 5G connectivity delivered by low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites is expected to provide coverage in extreme geographies or remote areas, such as seas and waterways where terrestrial coverage is absent, 5G smartphones, for the first time, may be capable of connectivity in locations previously only connected via legacy satellite systems.

“This testing and validation cooperation between Ericsson, Thales and Qualcomm Technologies will be a major milestone in the history of communications as the ultimate result could effectively mean that no matter where you are on Earth – in the middle of an ocean or the remotest forest – high-end, secure and cost-effective connectivity will be available through collaborative 5G satellite and terrestrial connectivity,” commented Erik Ekudden, senior vice president and chief technology officer, Ericsson.

The potential for widespread connectivity would boost 5G smartphone subscriber roaming service capabilities, stated Ericsson, as well as enabling global connectivity for transportation, energy and health sector 5G use cases. Further, in the event of major network outages or disasters, the non-terrestrial network could also be used as back-up support.

“The deployment of 5G networks marks a step change for the telecoms industry. It is a game changer, not only in terms of business opportunities but also in the skills required to connect and protect billions of people and things,” said Philippe Keryer, executive vice-president or Strategy, Research and Technology, Thales. “The research collaboration with Ericsson and Qualcomm Technologies will demonstrate the belief of our companies that 5G non-terrestrial Networks will contribute to this revolution and will take network resiliency and security to the next level.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999765157699585}",neutral,0.9999765157699585,0

By Dagmarah Mackos

(Reuters) - French defence and technology group Thales SA on Thursday raised its annual forecast for order intake and sales growth on the back of robust activity across all its segments in the first six months of the year.

Europe's largest arms electronics provider now expects sales of between 17.1 billion eurosand 17.5 billion euros ($17.4 billion and $17.8 billion)for the full year 2022, against a previously estimated range of 16.6 billion to 17.2 billion euros.

Full-year orders should come in ""significantly"" above the estimated sales, the company said in a statement.

The firm still anticipates its operating margin at 10.8% to 11.1%.

With the entry into force of a supply contract for Rafale warplanes to the United Arab Emirates, Thales' orders jumped 46% to 11.21 billion euros, surpassing analysts' expectations of 10.09 billion euros.

Overall operating income grew to 891 million euros in the first half of 2022 from 722 million a year earlier, as sales for the period reached 8.26 billion euros, boosted by its digital identity and security segment.

A settlement with Australia, which agreed to pay 555 million euros to Thales' subsidiary Naval Group after the country broke off a contract for 12 French submarines last September, offset the impact of European trade sanctions on the group's operations in Russia, Thales said.

The halt of its Russian business weighed especially on the aerospace unit, which is expected to take a 70 million euro hit in 2022. But Thales stressed that a post-pandemic recovery in air traffic and commercial aircraft production rates should firm up its order book.

In the medium term, the group is also banking on benefits from sustained increases of military budgets in Europe as the war in Ukraine has forced a rapid rethink of defence strategies in the region.

Space Alliance brings new firepower to the UK's national space strategy with Leonardo and Thales partnership ... - SatNews,"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL25ld3Muc2F0bmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8yMS9zcGFjZS1hbGxpYW5jZS1icmluZ3MtbmV3LWZpcmVwb3dlci10by10aGUtdWtzLW5hdGlvbmFsLXNwYWNlLXN0cmF0ZWd5LXdpdGgtbGVvbmFyZG8tYW5kLXRoYWxlcy1wYXJ0bmVyc2hpcC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The partnership’s UK-based technology, research and apprenticeships will help return astronauts to the Moon, ramp up the UK’s space-based intelligence gathering capabilities and turn the latest satellite technology towards the fight against climate change.

During a launch event at the Farnborough International Airshow, the Space Alliance has unveiled plans to boost the UK’s £16.5Bn space sector with the full backing of defense and security giants Leonardo and Thales, both of which have major UK-based operations.

The Space Alliance is a global partnership between Leonardo and Thales which brings together leading space technology companies Telespazio and Thales Alenia Space, which collectively employ over 11,000 people worldwide. In response to the publication of the UK’s National Space Strategy and Defense Space Strategy, the Space Alliance is moving to invest in and focus on growth in the UK, backed by parent companies Leonardo and Thales.

The Space Alliance in the UK is a strong industry team that can draw also on the technologies and resources of Leonardo UK and Thales UK, both well established as national champions in their respective fields. Together, Leonardo and Thales spend £1.3Bn annually with over 4,000 companies in the UK and invest more than £250M every year in UK-based research and development. The team employs 14,000 people across 25 sites in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Space technology and expertise at these sites is already being used to protect and defend military assets and critical national infrastructure. Meanwhile, the collection of data from cutting-edge sensors in orbit is increasingly being utilized for vital decision-making. The complementary capabilities of Thales Alenia Space in satellite systems and Telespazio in the services associated with them provides the Space Alliance with all the necessary expertise to respond effectively to market needs.

In addition to bringing its existing onshore capabilities to bear in support of the National Space Strategy and Defense Space Strategy, the Alliance also plans to develop new skills and knowledge in the UK, drawing on its 60 years of involvement in major European space programs. These have included the delivery of Galileo navigation services, military satellite communications programs and the production and operation of the Copernicus Earth observation satellites.

Ian Annett, Deputy CEO of the UK Space Agency, said, “The UK has a thriving space sector, employing 47,000 people and generating an annual income of £16.5 billion. We are committed to growing this further by capitalizing on the UK’s strengths, such as our leading small satellite industry, becoming the first country in Europe to offer launch capabilities and leading the way in space sustainability.

“We continue to work closely with partners from industry, with academia and across government to catalyze further investment, deliver new missions and capabilities, and champion space for the good of humanity. The Space Alliance will benefit from Thales and Leonardo’s strong track records of investing in the UK and renowned expertise, providing a further boost to the UK’s national space ambitions.”

A key part of the Space Alliance’s roadmap is to create a new generation of Space Apprenticeships, as projects such as NASA’s Artemis Moon Mission inspire a nationwide interest in space last seen around the original Moon landing in the 1960s. As part of an international team that includes several British companies, the Space Alliance is already working to create communications and navigation services on the Moon as part of the European Space Agency’s Moonlight project. Moonlight’s aim is to support the commercial and government missions that, in the second half of the decade, will explore the Moon and help develop a lunar economy. By offering such interesting, meaningful work and a route to highly skilled, well-paid jobs, the Space Alliance in UK will help pave the way to British leadership in space engineering.

Chair and CEO of Leonardo UK Norman Bone said, “The UK has a vibrant space industry with Leonardo, Thales and the Space Alliance already playing an active role. In the national space strategy, we see real potential to unlock further growth. This is a great sector for our young scientists and engineers to contribute to something truly meaningful and, by inspiring the next generation and providing great opportunities for fulfilling work, we can build an innovative and attractive space economy in the UK. Leonardo and Thales both offer outstanding early careers opportunities and we’re keen to expand these programmes via our space sector companies.”

CEO of Thales UK Alex Cresswell said, “Research and innovation are at the heart of both the defense and security sector and the space sector. Thales and Leonardo are both major inward investors in the UK and have developed a number of unique onshore capabilities with direct read across to the space sector. Our ongoing research into technologies such as AI and digital twins will be available for exploitation by the Space Alliance In the UK in support of the National Space Strategy, which itself brings together civil and defence policy for the first time, and the Defense Space Strategy.”

CEO of Telespazio UK Mark Hewer said, “Our group can bring to bear so much knowledge and investment into the UK, whether leveraging on our delivery of global satellite communications, operating major international earth observation missions and exploiting the power of big data on security and climate issues, to delivering actionable intelligence and domain awareness to commercial and military customers. As we look to advance the UK’s space capabilities, companies like Telespazio and Thales Alenia Space will be able to combine UK onshore research and engineering with international collaboration to help realize the UK’s vision of becoming a leading space nation.”

CEO of Thales Alenia Space in the UK Andrew Stanniland said, “We depend on space for our prosperity and security, so it’s no wonder that The UK space sector is growing faster than the rest of the UK economy. With the backing of our multinational parent companies, the Space Alliance will be able to act as a catalyst for this growth. Our plan will see us develop valuable intellectual property in the UK and draw on the best of our European heritage to strengthen our onshore expertise. It’s a really exciting time to be part of the sector.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9189413189888}",positive,0.9189413189888,1

"TransLink, Thales Confirm Two New SkyTrain Projects - RailwayAge Magazine","Thu, 07 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWx3YXlhZ2UuY29tL3Bhc3Nlbmdlci9yYXBpZC10cmFuc2l0L3RyYW5zbGluay10aGFsZXMtY29uZmlybS10d28tbmV3LXNreXRyYWluLXByb2plY3RzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TransLink has awarded two contracts to Thales under the Expo and Millennium Upgrade Program to enable a 22 km (13.6-mile) expansion of the fully automated Metro Vancouver SkyTrain system, with 41 new trains expected to be in service by the end of 2027.

Thales, which has been delivering state-of-the-art train control technology for the SkyTrain system for almost 40 years, will provide SelTrac™ Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) technology to deliver a new Operations and Control Center (OCC2) and a fully automated depot named Operations and Maintenance Center 4 (OMC4). These two new projects will directly support TransLink’s 2050 Vision to provide “convenient, reliable, affordable, safe and comfortable, and carbon-free transit for Metro Vancouver.”

“We are building on an over 35-year partnership with TransLink as we support their vision for the future of transit in Metro Vancouver,” said Alcino De Sousa, Vice President and Managing Director, Thales Urban Rail Signaling. The provision of our SelTrac™ technology to these two new facilities represents the next page in our shared history with TransLink.”

According to TransLink, in 2018 the Expo Line and Millennium Lines saw an on-time performance (OTP) of 96.38%–the highest performance level on record for SkyTrain and higher than the performance level of the metros in most major cities in North America. Additionally, according to TransLink, customers of the environmentally friendly SkyTrain, which saw more than 114 million boardings in 2019, collectively save 1.3 million kgs of greenhouse gases (GHGs) by choosing transit over driving a gasoline car each day.

The new OCC2 includes a control room and the capacity for SkyTrain expansions into the future. Thales will provide the Automatic Train Control (ATC) elements for the new OCC2, which will feature the latest in train control, network and cybersecurity technology. Thales will be working with local partners and suppliers to deliver this project successfully.

To keep up with passenger ridership increases, the SkyTrain system expansions have driven a corresponding need for more trains, and, in turn, increased train storage and maintenance.

The Egyptian National Authority for Tunnels has tasked Thales, in partnership with Orascom Construction and Colas Rail, to work on Cairo Metro Line 4 Phase 1, which will be 42km long with 35 stations.

Building the 19km first phase is expected to take six years, with 16 stations, a depot and an operations control centre.

It will connect the centre of Greater Cairo to the Giza Pyramid Complex, which is 13km to the south-west of Cairo's centre.

Thales is to supply and install systems including radio, multi-service network, wayside telephone and wireless LAN systems, wayside equipment for security systems, passenger Information and public address and revenue collection solutions.

Phase 2 of Cairo Metro Line 4 will come later, with additional 23.5 km, 19 stations, and 92 trains.

Thales has already provided the first ticketing system for Cairo Line 1, and the communication systems and ticketing for Line 2 and 3.

The new line is part of an ambitious infrastructure plan and will cross Cairo from east to west, and - in addition to easing congestion - is expected to be heavily used by tourists, as it will provide a connection with the pyramids site and the future Grand Egyptian Museum.

“This new Line 4 will significantly improve the density of people in one of the most congested city of Egypt,"" says Benoît Couture, VP for integrated communications and supervision activities.

Indra is involved in another of Cairo's transit projects, a monorail.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999996542930603}",neutral,0.999996542930603,0

(EXPAL). The new agreement aims to establish Sovereign Capability solutions in Australia for large caliber Naval munitions and fuzes in support of the Australian Defence Force and our allies.

The new agreement will facilitate the technology transfer to Australia of Intellectual Property and support the development of new manufacturing processes that will enable the local production of critical munitions including, 5” Charge Propelling (CP) and high explosives projectiles, as well as advanced fuze solutions.

The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) currently utilises 5” naval munitions that are manufactured and supplied separately by both EXPAL in Spain, and Thales in Australia. This new agreement between Expal and Thales will not only provide the RAN greater ‘on demand’, localised access to leading EXPAL-Thales 5” technology, it will also provide greater surety of supply for critical 5” munitions capability.

Expal and Thales have also agreed to an extensive research and development program, providing a roadmap to the Australian Defence Force for 5” munition technology enhancement on current and future RAN platforms including, munitions offering longer range, reduced sensitivity and precision strike capability.

Corry Roberts, Vice President Land, Thales Australia & New Zealand said: “Over the past 12 months we have established significant partnerships with some of the worlds’ preeminent munitions providers including EXPAL, to nurture technology transfer to Australia and establish local production capability of critical munitions. This is a clear demonstration of the company’s long-term commitment to growing and maintaining an enduring, sustainable and resilient sovereign industrial munitions capability for the Australian Defence Force”.

Luis Abad, Vice President Sales, EXPAL said: “We are looking forward to intensifying the cooperation with Thales Australia and provide our Naval Munitions expertise. Our complementary technologies will enhance Royal Australian Navy capabilities and optimize Australian Industrial Capability (AIC).”

For more than 30 years Thales Australia has built a national industrial ecosystem, including over 600 Australian suppliers, to support the delivery of sovereign munitions capability to Australian Defence Force. Demonstrating that maximising technology transfer to Australia on major Defence projects is a significant driver of growth in building Australia’s sovereign industrial capability.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8850436806678772}",neutral,0.8850436806678772,0

There’s no network yet, but each of the companies conducted their own detailed research and decided now’s the time to enter the phase where they conduct tests of smartphones and validate 5G non-terrestrial networks (NTN).

Of course, it’s a crowed LEO space with the likes of SpaceX’s Starlink among those in the business of delivering broadband connectivity in unserved and underserved areas.

In a press release, Ericsson, Qualcomm and Thales suggested 5G NTNs could provide coverage in places normally only covered by legacy satellite systems with limited data connectivity capabilities. Besides sectors like transportation, energy and health, potential use cases involve back-up support to terrestrial networks in the event of major network outages or disasters.

The companies received the go-ahead by 3GPP in March through specifications in Release 17. Their initial tests will take place in France.

“As a 3GPP-backed technology, 5G NTNs will be able to capitalize on a large ecosystem of standardized products and components,” the companies said. “The new specification also enables the inclusion of NTN technologies in 5G devices, providing opportunities for technology vendors to easily and quickly scale 5G NTN compatibility across devices.”

Hakan Djuphammar, head of Special Projects at Ericsson's technology arm, told Reuters that the companies will first do simulations on the ground before carrying out tests in space. He also told the news outlet that discussions are underway for testing on the International Space Station and with a few satellites.

Ericsson’s task is to verify a 5G virtual Radio Access Network (RAN) stack, modified to handle radio signals propagating via the fast-moving LEO satellites.

Qualcomm will provide test phones verifying that 5G NTNs can be accessed by future 5G smartphones, while Thales’ role is to verify a 5G radio satellite payload suitable for deployment on LEO satellites.

In a statement, Ericsson SVP and CTO Erik Ekudden said it’s too early to say when any resulting 5G equipped prototype satellite could be launched into orbit for real operational use. However, the highly technical ground-based testing and validation work planned between Ericsson, Thales and Qualcomm Technologies is “key to making it happen.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999951124191284}",neutral,0.9999951124191284,0

Examining Thales Optiq QLED system - a challenger to OLED in the sky? - Economy Class & Beyond - Kevin Marshall,"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vZWNvbm9teWNsYXNzYW5kYmV5b25kLmJvYXJkaW5nYXJlYS5jb20vMjAyMi8wNy8yMS9leGFtaW5pbmctdGhhbGVzLW9wdGlxLXFsZWQtc3lzdGVtLWEtY2hhbGxlbmdlci10by1vbGVkLWluLXRoZS1za3kv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In our coverage of AIX, we’ve seen a lot of OLED screens. There is a also a QLED product in the fold, with Thales offering it on their Optiq IFE seat-ends.

This is part of the AVANT Up ecosystem that Thales offers. Optiq offers a 4K high dynamic range (HDR) screen that is enabled using Samsung QLED technology to provide high picture quality plus a 50% increase in reliability and a 30% decrease in weight.

It seems that Thales has chosen Samsung’s Quantum Dot Technology (QLED). This differs from OLED as it uses semiconductor nanocrystals which can produce pure monochromatic red, green, and blue light, as opposed to OLED’s method of lighting up only the pixels you need. The seat-end devices have been developed in partnership with HARMAN, a Samsung Company.

There’s an advantage to QLED – and it doesn’t suffer from the burn-in.

The new in-seat and cabin displays have a sleek passenger-centric design focused on ergonomics and fit seamlessly into the modern cabin environment – again thinness is a thing for reducing weight in the cabin.

The Optiq screen can produce up to more than one billion colours for its display element. However, that is part of the story, as we head into connectivity. The seat end is enabled with Two Bluetooth connections and built-in Wi-Fi allows passengers to pair multiple devices simultaneously to the system.

In the example below, a Game controller is paired to the screen, which can also be connected with headphones for those who want to game at 35,000ft.

And yes, your writer tried gaming on an Xbox controller for the first time on a racing game, with minimal perceived lag when using it with the screen.. The chin bar is designed to be line-serviceable with it taking a matter of minutes to swap, rather than replacing the entire seat-end unit. It is available in a variety of sizes – 12″, 13″, 15″, 17″, 20″, 24″ and 32″ American Airlines is launching AVANT Optiq aboard the Airbus A321XLR and Boeing 787-9 fleets from 2023. Deploying power to seat Thales has developed a Smart Power Management system called Pulse. This delivers 350watts of power to a seat-set of four and allows for dynamic power allocation from that seat. Pulse is designed to take advantage of the USB Power Delivery standard which laptops, phones and nearly everything with a USB-C socket is moving to. Pulse is a modular system built with smart power management that dynamically allocates power where the passengers need it. Pulse is highly efficient while being compact, providing a 30% weight reduction, lower heat dissipation and the ability to install Pulse between the seat beams.

Combining all together with UP.

Of course, it’s not just enough to have monitors on seatbacks. The issue of storage remains. Thankfully, Thales has their Avant Up platform.

This allows for handsets and screens to be integrated into the IFE platform. The latest server on the platform can store up to 20TB of data, has Ultra High Definition encryption keys to ensure the security of content, and can support over 185 simultaneous 4K streams.

AVANT Up is Android-based (the same sort of operating that drives the Andriod compatible phones – allowing for the potential for integrating a vast selection of games and applications from the Android development community.

A QLED future?

There’s been a lot of fancy new screens being shown off at this show, with people showing off their demo products in the best condition. But we run into the usual problems of “who’s technology is best”, but also the one of content that I covered in another piece.

Simply put, you can put the fanciest seat-back monitors on a plane, but the content has to at least be watchable on it.

We’ve seen cases of this around with 1080p (HD) screens being installed and seeing 480p or worse output being delivered to the screen – negating the benefit of them being installed in the first place.

But if the content is there – there will be one winner – the passenger when they’re glued to the seat and the immersive experience such a screen gives.

Thales Alenia Space and the Belgian team of the UK’s QinetiQ are backing the development of so-called ‘skimsats’.

The pair are working with the European Space Agency (ESA) and a contract signed to pave the way for small multi-mission satellites which will operate in Very Low Earth Orbit (VLEO).

“The Phase A/B1 study will advance the design of Skimsat demonstrator, a VLEO multi-mission (<300km) satellite that aims to significantly reduce the cost of Earth observation while increasing performance by operating at substantially lower altitudes. The highly modular, compact flexible satellite will capitalize on developments in high efficiency electrical propulsion to compensate for air drag,” says a statement.

The compact size of Skimsat will allow to be compatible with the launchers designed for small satellites with respect to dimensions, such as those currently being developed in the UK, to provide customers with substantially shorter lead times than traditional satellite launchers of similar capability.

The study is being led by Thales Alenia Space in the UK and QinetiQ Space team in Belgium and is funded under ESA’s Discovery Preparation and Technology Development (DPTD) activities. Payloads using the multi-mission Skimsat platform will be identified as part of the study for an In Orbit Demonstration to show applications in VLEO prior to the first commercial mission. This new initiative is fully included in the new space approach of Thales Alenia Space and reflects the company’s capability to address disruptive needs in partnership with smaller companies.

Operating at VLEO would normally mean that atmospheric drag would see the satellites re-enter and burn up within about 30 days. The new concept sees mission lifetime expanded to about 6-12 months thanks to onboard electric propulsion and the surface design of the craft.

Andrew Stanniland CEO at Thales Alenia Space in the UK commented, “This important study for an In Orbit Demonstration in VLEO brings together the technical excellence from our pioneering teams based in the UK, working in close partnership with QinetiQ Space team in Belgium.

The project will leverage Miprons’ proprietary technology, a miniaturized, high-thrust thruster using a green, cost-effective propellant: water. Through the chemical process of electrolysis, water is broken down into hydrogen and oxygen, and fed into the combustion chamber. Water being the only fuel would allow for faster maneuver times during orbit-raising, de-orbiting and collision avoidance.

As the system is both compact and scalable, it can be used on all sizes of satellites, according to Thales Alenia. Miprons uses 3D printing for a number of components needed for the technology.

The high-efficiency thruster with reduced weight and volume will be purpose-designed for Thales Alenia’s satellites. The company will lead the development of the thruster, expecting to achieve a reliable, high-performance satellite propulsion solution.

Thales Alenia Space and MIPRONS to develop innovative water-powered satellite thruster - 3D Printing Industry,"Thu, 28 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovLzNkcHJpbnRpbmdpbmR1c3RyeS5jb20vbmV3cy90aGFsZXMtYWxlbmlhLXNwYWNlLWFuZC1taXByb25zLXRvLWRldmVsb3AtaW5ub3ZhdGl2ZS13YXRlci1wb3dlcmVkLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS10aHJ1c3Rlci0yMTI5OTUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aerospace manufacturer Thales Alenia Space has teamed up with Italian start-up MIPRONS to develop a new water-fuelled satellite propulsion system.

Set to be built using a combination of MIPRONS’ proprietary technology and 3D printing, the tiny, eco-friendly thruster is designed to only use water as a propellant. As such, once ready, the system is expected to enable the faster, cleaner maneuvering of satellites, while being small and scalable enough to launch devices of varying shapes and sizes.

“This agreement confirms Thales Alenia Space’s strategy to play a pivotal role in new space initiatives, reflected in synergies generated with exciting new start-ups that catalyze the entire space ecosystem,” said Massimo Claudio Comparini, SVP of Observation, Exploration and Navigation at Thales Alenia Space. “We are always willing to tackle new challenges that emphasize the growing strategic importance of the space sector.”

“We are very proud to team up with MIPRONS, which is gaining increasing international recognition, since our collaboration could well change the paradigm for space missions.”

Multinational aerospace collaboration

Essentially a joint venture, owned 67% by French Multinational Thales and 33% by Italian defense contractor Leonardo, Thales Alenia Space markets defense, travel and aerospace manufacturing services to commercial and state-level entities alike. With FY 2021 revenue of €2.15 billion, 8,900 employees and a presence in ten countries, the firm has also established itself as Europe’s largest satellite builder.

In its push for satellite manufacturing supremacy, the business has often turned to 3D printing. Since partnering with Poly-Shape SAS to develop what was then the largest-ever metal 3D printed satellite part in 2016, Thales Alenia Space has fired hundreds of polymer 3D printed tubes into space, and used the technology to support the launches of the Telkom 3S, SGDC and KOREASAT-7 satellites.

More recently, the company has begun utilizing 3D printing in series satellite production, by integrating the technology into its Spacebus NEO platform production process. The first run of these additively manufactured components was developed as part of a project with Eutelsat Communications. But the firm continues to innovate with the technology, reportedly partnering with 3D Systems last year to 3D print upgraded mechanisms for controlling the satellite’s steering.

MIPRONS’ satellite-thrusting plans

Based in the town of Colleferro, MIPRONS has spent the last three years developing propulsion systems for microsatellites. In that time, the firm has sought to come up with the tiniest, most powerful and versatile propulsion system possible, and so far its efforts have yielded two satellite-thrusting solutions: ALEXIUS and ALBIREO.

Despite being less than a third of the size of a nanosatellite, the company’s inaugural ALEXIUS device is capable of delivering up to 20N of thrust at a specific impulse for more than 350 seconds. The thruster is therefore small and powerful enough to allow tiny satellites to rapidly carry out high-thrust maneuvers, as part of commercial, scientific, intelligence, defense or security missions.

MIPRONS’ follow-up, the ALBIREO, is essentially being developed as an ALEXIUS upgrade that lowers its weight, while enabling it to facilitate low and high-thrust maneuvers in a single system. The former remains at the lab-testing stage, but the firm aims to have it flight-ready by Q4 2023, and both are said to be enabled by a ‘proprietary technology’ it has developed.

While many existing satellites are propelled by chemical thrusters, in which a fuel tends to be burned as a means of providing thrust, electric thrusters are increasingly gaining traction as a lower mass, more efficient means of propulsion.

In a similar vein, the company has now announced its own plans, to build on its technology, and develop a new system that uses electrolysis to break down water into hydrogen and oxygen, before feeding them into a combustion chamber. The thruster is reportedly set to feature several 3D printed components, with MIPRONS leading its R&D, and Thales Alenia Space supporting its environmental testing.

When flight-ready, the system is expected to facilitate the orbit-raising, de-orbiting and collision avoidance of satellites. Following the project’s unveiling, MIPRONS CEO Angelo Minotti said that even though the program is still in its early stages, it was “a privilege to earn the trust of one of the world’s largest space companies.” As such, the firm aims to have the system operational “as soon as possible.”

MIPRONS is one of many aerospace firms currently experimenting with using 3D printing to produce more efficient satellite propulsion systems. In April 2022, for instance, it was announced that Aerojet Rocketdyne’s 3D printed quad thruster had been optimized, in a way that could unlock faster, lower-cost and more sustainable lunar exploration.

Back in 2021, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) also revealed that they’d designed and tested a 3D printed ion-powered satellite thruster. Believed at the time to be the first fully-printed device of its kind, the tiny propulsion system fires charged ionic particles from its outer shell, giving it a few micronewtons of propulsion.

Spirit flips the switch on Wi-Fi across A320s and A321s - - Runway Girl Network,"Wed, 13 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjIvMDcvc3Bpcml0LXdpLWZpL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The year is 2018. Spirit Airlines is flying high on its “Invest in the Guest” initiative and a major contract with Thales InFlyt Experience to install Ka-band satellite-powered onboard Internet across its entire fleet by summer 2019. But program delays quickly begin to mount, and summer 2019 slips to the end of 2019, then to 2020, and so on.

After a trial phase, during which guests aboard fitted Airbus A320 aircraft could access the service, Spirit today finally announced it has flipped the switch on Wi-Fi across its A320ceo/neo and A321 fleets, bringing low-cost, high-performance Internet to hundreds of its flights across the United States and close-in international destinations.

Spirit is falling short of its initial lofty ambitions, however. When originally announced in 2018, the plan was to outfit the entire fleet with connectivity and to get it done quickly. At launch, connectivity will be lacking on Spirit’s approximately 30 A319s, representing nearly 20% of the fleet and 15-20% of daily departures. New deliveries of A320s and A321s will also have to wait for installation after the busy summer season.

“Low cost is our DNA and and we partnered with Thales on I think a very innovative solution that has allowed us to get into market, keep our costs down and at the same time provide a solution that we’re very proud of,” said Spirit vice president Omnichannel Rana Ghosh during a pre-launch media briefing.

But the process wasn’t without its challenges. Spirit encountered delays during the initial testing phase of the selected Thales antenna. Precise details about the problems were few and far between, but a source later suggested to Runway Girl Network that an issue arose with a polarity switch and then with moisture getting into the antenna and not getting out.

The budget operator wasn’t alone in seeing Wi-Fi equipage delays, however. Air Canada continues to install Thales’ so-called FlytLIVE system across its 737 MAX fleet, also years past an anticipated completion date.

Spirit and Thales eventually switched to ThinKom Solutions’ popular Ka2517 mechanically steered phased-array antenna. Management said the Ka2517 is “three times more efficient than any other antenna”, calling it a “significant game changer”. And it touted “market leader” Hughes’ modem technology, which is also part of the package.

The carrier’s inflight Internet service is initially launching with leased Ka-band satellite capacity on in-orbit Hughes satellites, though the service will pivot to the recently launched, high-capacity SES-17 satellite by September of this year. Thales will continue to tap Hughes to fill in the gaps where SES-17 may not reach for the immediate future, though it does not expect to need this overlay in the long term.

Spirit says SES-17 will allow passengers to access an at-home type of Internet experience at low, but not free, prices. Browse plans will start at $2.99 while a more robust streaming plan claiming 20-times faster speeds will start at $5.99.

Prices will dynamically increase depending on flight length, with a current maximum of about $16 primarily on transcon flights where Spirit says usage has been the highest during its trial phase.

Spirit will not offer a free messaging plan as many other airlines have done in recent years, but has left the door open. Free messaging, a “high value item,” is “in the works”, said Ghosh.

“Our model doesn’t generally lean towards free … but we recognize there’s probably a variation that makes sense for us to offer,” Ghosh remarked. “From the technical side of things I think we’re pretty comfortable. This is something that’s very doable, and I think it’s just a matter at this point of timing more so than anything else when we can introduce this.”

As with most other services offered by the ultra low-cost carrier, Spirit will offer the opportunity to pre-purchase Wi-Fi during the checkout process on its website starting today, and on its mobile app starting on 10 August for flights departing on or after 24 August.

While it’s still not free connectivity, offering an opportunity to include the price of Wi-Fi into the total fare may very well reduce purchase friction and lead to higher take rates compared to only offering purchase options in the on board portal. Passengers will also earn free Spirit points for their Wi-Fi purchase, a nice and rather unique perk, but Wi-Fi will not be included in any of Spirit’s existing bundles at launch.

Design and Additive Manufacturing Expertise from 3D Systems to Serve Thales Alenia Space Satellite Sub-System - Digital Engineering 24/7,"Tue, 12 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaWdpdGFsZW5naW5lZXJpbmcyNDcuY29tL2FydGljbGUvZGVzaWduLWFuZC1hZGRpdGl2ZS1tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nLWV4cGVydGlzZS1mcm9tLTNkLXN5c3RlbXMtdG8tc2VydmUtdGhhbGVzLWFsZW5pYS1zcGFjZS1zYXRlbGxpdGUtc3ViLXN5c3RlbS9wcm90b3R5cGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In this Special Focus Issue of Digital Engineering, we take a look at trends in...

In the December issue, we reveal the results of our annual reader survey, along with...

The resultant Electrical THruster Mechanism (ETHM) is comprised of seven different additively manufactured brackets. Additive manufacturing (AM) enabled the mechanism to be packaged within a limited volume at the lowest possible mass. Experts within 3D Systems’ Application Innovation Group contributed design and manufacturing know-how to Thales Alenia Space’s ETHM project, packaging their expertise within the final build files that were transferred to Thales’ AM production facility in Morocco. This expert-generated manufacturing plan enabled Thales to seamlessly transition production to its own additive manufacturing facility which is outfitted with several 3D Systems’ direct metal printers.

“Every feature is more or less conventional, but putting them together in a single compact and competitive mechanism is really a challenge.”

- Gilles Lubrano, ETHM Product Manager

The Challenge

OPTIMIZE CRITICAL SATELLITE SUB-SYSTEM FOR ACCURACY AND RELIABILITY

The Electrical THruster mechanism points the satellite propulsion of the Spacebus NEO satellite to correctly position it in space. As such, the reliability of this component is mission-critical. Four ETHMs are required per satellite, forming the chassis around the engines. These parts perform as two axis gimbals holding the electrical propulsion unit, and enabling it to vector with smooth and steady movements.

To meet Thales Alenia Space requirements, the ETHM needed to balance volume and mass constraints while meeting stringent performance specifications, including:

High angle pointing accuracy (0.1-degrees);

Part count reduction including functional integration of various thruster commodities (harness and piping);

Serial production that meets quality requirements for orbital class products.

The Solution

CONSULTATION AND COLLABORATION FOR SCALABLE PRODUCTION

01 Design for Additive Manufacturing Consultation

Thales Alenia Space and 3D Systems have an enduring collaborative partnership, and have worked together to put over 1,700 flightworthy parts in orbit as of 2021. In the ETHM project, Thales Alenia Space partnered with 3D Systems’ Application Innovation Group (AIG) to combine several functions within a small design space while guaranteeing accurate dynamics.

3D Systems experts helped Thales Alenia Space achieve an optimized strength-to-weight ratio while solving for areas of heat concentration to protect functional components from thermal damage.

The total dynamic volume allotted for the ETHM is 480 mm x 480 mm x 380 mm, and includes rotary actuators, harness, tubing, and a holding mechanism. 3D Systems provided manufacturability and design feedback to help Thales Alenia Space achieve its performance objectives. 3D Systems experts helped Thales Alenia Space achieve an optimized strength-to-weight ratio while solving for areas of heat concentration to protect functional components from thermal damage.

By using AM to design and produce a system, Thales Alenia Space triggered an expansion of positive impacts. Light-weighting improved thrust efficiency beyond what conventional manufacturing would allow, which in turn improved fuel efficiency, resulting in lower costs and new opportunities for technical innovation elsewhere.

02 Manufacturing Flow Development

3D Systems helped Thales Alenia Space develop a robust manufacturing flow comprising post-processes like CNC-finishing and 100% tomography inspection to guarantee product and process repeatability in an AS9100 controlled environment. 3D Systems application engineers also provided guidance on the level and sequencing of quality controls for risk mitigation to help Thales Alenia Space ensure a thorough, quality-oriented, and cost-efficient manufacturing flow.

This expertise helped Thales Alenia Space achieve the 0.1-degree pointing accuracy required with an exacting CNC and inspection workflow in which some parts have as many as 249 measurement points taken via coordinate measuring machine that must be in spec. 3D Systems’ collaborative approach included education about the technology along the process of integrated quality controls, as well as root cause analyses of non-conformities against Thales Alenia Space specifications to ensure success. Prior to transitioning production to Thales Alenia Space, 3D Systems helped organize and coordinate a best-in-class supply chain to fulfill series production and produced more than 70 parts at its Customer Innovation Center in Belgium, which is part of 3D Systems’ AIG. The high capacity of this facility and repeatability across 3D Systems’ DMP machines helped ensure a short lead time.

03 Print File Preparation and Transfer

To ensure a seamless transition of ETHM production to Thales Alenia Space, 3D Systems application engineers developed each print file in 3DXpert®, incorporating years of AM expertise that saved Thales Alenia Space time and money while guaranteeing quality. Using these expert-generated build files, repeatable production is possible on any 3D Systems direct metal printer. The final brackets are printed in LaserForm Ti6Al4V grade 23 titanium material.

Several aspects of the thruster mechanism design made 3D Systems’ guidance on print strategy of particularly high value, including:

Maintaining intended roundness of several open structures with large circular interfaces.

Balancing support strength with removability.

Accounting for thermal stresses during the printing process that vary based on the geometry and material printed.

3D Systems’ experience working with titanium materials has helped countless critical applications balance complexity and strength to achieve project parameters. Tools like Oqton’s 3DXpert simulation module help support these projects by reducing the number of iterations required to achieve a successful outcome.

Some parts of the ETHM have as many as 249 measurement points taken via coordinated measuring machine that must be in spec.

04 Technology Transfer

The final brackets are printed in LaserForm Ti6Al4V grade 23 titanium material.

Thales Alenia Space is now capable of printing these parts at its own facilities following the training and technology transfer 3D Systems has provided over the years. Thales’ group 3D factory in Morocco is outfitted with several 3D Systems’ DMP machines, and took advantage of 3D Systems’ technology transfer offering at the time of installation. Technology transfer is an in-depth, AM-specific training designed to help new printer customers accelerate their transition to AM and safeguard their investment. In combination with the pre-developed build files, 3D Systems has fully supported Thales in its transition to in-house production.

“Using the same machines as the ones in our Customer Innovation Center in Belgium, Thales has simplified its access to a successful print so its team can focus on the industrialization of AM and maximize its return on investments,” said Koen Huybrechts, Manager Application Development, Application Innovation Group, 3D Systems.

The Result

BALANCE OF KEY PERFORMANCE CRITERIA FOR OPTIMIZED, SYSTEM-LEVEL DESIGN

ETHM is one of the first full space mechanisms entirely designed with additive manufacturing in mind. The seven different topologically optimized brackets raised the standards of a multi-disciplinary team by their size, the required high precision, and system criticality.

Pointing accuracy of 0.1-degrees ensures mechanism will perform as expected in flight

Increased thruster efficiency from reduced weight of topologically optimized brackets

249 measurement points validated for quality control of most complex part

Integration and protection of thruster commodities for optimal form and function

A large data-driven telecommunications satellite that uses innovative technology to keep cool as well as other innovations – developed under an ESA Partnership Project – has started its commercial service.

The satellite will provide broadband connectivity for commercial shipping, aviation, governments and enterprises through its operator, SES, as well connecting underserved areas and accelerating digital inclusion.

Called SES-17, it was launched on 23 October 2021 and spent the next six months navigating into geostationary orbit.

SES-17 was launched together with Syracuse 4, another Spacebus Neo satellite, on board an Ariane 5

The very high throughput SES-17 belongs to a new generation of data intensive satellites and, with its new fifth-generation digital transparent processor, is able to deliver up to ten times more capacity than traditional satellites with unmatched flexibility and efficiency.

Processing large volumes of data generates heat within the spacecraft that must be dissipated for the satellite to continue long-lasting and reliable operations. Engineering teams under the ESA Neosat Partnership Project with satellite manufacturer Thales Alenia Space developed an innovative thermal cooling system – the two-phase mechanically pumped loop – that is able to circulate fluid refrigerant to remove heat. It is a first of its kind to be featured on a large commercial telecommunications satellite.

ESA Partnership Projects help to develop sustainable end-to-end systems up to in-orbit validation.

ESA’s Neosat programme comprises both Spacebus Neo by Thales Alenia Space and Eurostar Neo by Airbus and is managed jointly by ESA and the French Space Agency CNES. It includes development up to in-orbit validation of new satellite product lines for both companies, allowing the European space industry to deliver competitive satellites for the global commercial satellite market.

Some 16 Neosat satellites have now been sold by European companies, and the programme is predicted to generate more than 20 times the return on investment to its 12 participating states and their space companies, according to an independent analysis by Euroconsult.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9957270622253418}",neutral,0.9957270622253418,0

Without specifying the French system, Iraqi News Agency quoted Inad as saying that the Thales system would be linked with the country’s newly launched Air Defense Command Operations Center in Baghdad.

He added that the system “will work on high detection of hostile air targets, and will be installed in different places in the country.”

The French company, along with MBDA, manufactures the MAMBA — also known as the SAMP/T— air defense system. It can intercept “cruise missiles, manned and unmanned aircraft and tactical ballistic missiles in the 600 kilometers (373 miles) range class.”

Lockheed Long-Range Radar

The minister also said that the center would work “in conjunction” with the soon-to-arrive American-type TPS 77 radar system.

“This system is the first link to develop the air defense command and bring it to the highest levels of combat readiness to secure air control over all Iraqi airspace, as it is specific to radar detection long-term,” the outlet quoted him.

The Lockheed Martin long-range radar system has a range of over 400 kilometers (248 miles).

Inad added that the ministry is working to procure short and medium-range radars “to complete air sovereignty over all parts of the country.”

Radars Already Deployed

Meanwhile, Iraq’s Air Defense Commander Maan al-Saadi revealed that two long-range radar systems have already been deployed in the southern and western provinces of Al-Qadisiyah and Anbar.

Iraq has been seeking a modern air defense system to replace its antiquated systems from the 60s and 70s to counter emerging threats such as drones, missiles, and artillery shells fired by terrorists.

The country’s parliament reportedly allocated an undisclosed amount of money to purchase a foreign air defense system last year.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998712539672852}",neutral,0.9998712539672852,0
Skimsat study to put satellites into very low Earth orbit - The Engineer,"Wed, 27 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWVuZ2luZWVyLmNvLnVrL2NvbnRlbnQvbmV3cy9za2ltc2F0LXN0dWR5LXRvLXB1dC1zYXRlbGxpdGVzLWludG8tdmVyeS1sb3ctZWFydGgtb3JiaXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The cost of Earth observation could be reduced considerably with Skimsats, a new class of spacecraft subject to research being carried out by Thales Alenia Space and Qinetiq.

The companies have signed a study contract with the European Space Agency to advance the small multi-mission satellites being designed to operate in Very Low Earth Orbit (VLEO).

The Skimsat concept was proposed in a 2016 paper titled Skimsats: bringing down the cost of Earth Observation. In it, former Thales Alenia Space employees Andrew Bacon and Ben Olivier (both now at Space Forge) said ‘The Skimsat concept is based upon the idea of that the closer you are to a target, the smaller an imaging payload can be, leading to reductions in overall satellite size and cost.’

Challenges to Skimsats include the effects of drag, damage to optical surfaces caused by higher densities of atomic oxygen found at low altitudes, and higher rates of orbital drift.

“One of the things we’ll do with Qinetiq is optimize the structure of the satellite in an attempt to reduce that drag, and that means we can optimize our propellent budget,” said Stephen Mellor, product manager at Thales Alenia Space UK.

Mellor added that accommodating equipment brings changes the frontal area of the Skimsat, which changes the impact of drag and the satellite’s propellant budget.

“The study provides us with an opportunity to do that exercise where we do some tradeoffs with equipment, we look at the impact of various changes to the structure in terms of the platform and what that means for the business case as well: how long will the satellite last…what size of telescope can we accommodate. These are some of the tradeoffs we can do,” Mellor said.

MORE FROM AEROSPACE

Payloads using the multi-mission Skimsat platform will be identified as part of the study for an In Orbit Demonstration to show applications in VLEO prior to the first commercial mission.

“Things have moved on over the years with small satellites in LEO [Low Earth Orbit] for 5-to-7 years,” said Mellor. “Although the launch costs will be lower with smaller launchers that we’ll get from the UK, ultimately we need to be targeting three years minimum for the platform lifetime.”

Mellor added that the nominal altitude for an in-orbit demonstrator will be 240km, the minimum being about 220km, and the maximum 260km.

Protestors with hammers force evacuation of Glasgow factory 'making weapons for Israel' - The Jewish Chronicle,"Mon, 11 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWpjLmNvbS9uZXdzL3Byb3Rlc3RvcnMtd2l0aC1oYW1tZXJzLWZvcmNlLWV2YWN1YXRpb24tb2YtZ2xhc2dvdy1mYWN0b3J5LW1ha2luZy13ZWFwb25zLWZvci1pc3JhZWwta3pxb3d5NmLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Extremist pro-Palestinian protestors this morning forced the evacuation of a factory in Glasgow they claim is producing weapons for the Israeli military.

Some wearing balaclavas and carrying hammers, the activists scaled the roof of the Thales factory.

The activists’ group, Palestine Action (PA), claimed the protest had caused “severe damage” – prompting critics to ask why the police had not taken stronger action.

Images posted by PA showed police officers climbing up a ladder by the side of the building as a protestor raised his finger in a victory sign, with a Palestinian flag draped below.

Their tweet boasted: “Police scale up the Glasgow factory in an attempt to stop ‘crime'. But there's no need; we're already on the job – we're smashing up Thales' death factory.”

The group claimed that their action had succeed in “forcing workers to evacuate, preventing site operations and striking at Thales through damaging site facilities”.

A press release by Palestine Action said: “A team of activists scaled the roof at dawn, and began causing severe damage to site facilities.”

Police Scotland responded by saying the force is a “rights-based organisation”, with a duty to “protect the rights of people who wish to peacefully protest”.

Pro-Israel campaigners criticised the police for failing to take further action, saying “smashing up a factory” is “hardly a peaceful protest”.

Earlier this year the JC exposed Palestine Action’s planned campaign of destruction against Israeli-linked firms.

Palestine Action Scotland used Twitter to announce their rooftop protest at Thales, saying it is a ""killer weapons factory, occupying a vital link in Israel’s military supply chain"".

The group claimed: ”Thales is one of the world’s largest arms companies, producing military drones, armoured vehicles, missile systems and more.

“Amongst the assorted warfare-related hardware made by Thales, the Watchkeeper drone project stands out.

“The project seeks to further the policing and surveillance of captive populations belonging to the nations of Iraq, Palestine and Afghanistan.”

Among those drawn to the scene after protestors were seen on the site was Layla Khan, from Glasgow.

She said: “I think it’s really great that they are here and have shown the initiative to stop Thales doing what they do in Glasgow.

“We don’t agree with what they’re doing. It’s violence and we don’t want it here in the city. We want it gone.”

A Police Scotland spokesperson said: ”Police Scotland is a rights-based organisation that puts our values of integrity, fairness, respect and a commitment to upholding human rights at the heart of everything we do.

“We have a duty under the European Convention on Human Rights to protect the rights of people who wish to peacefully protest or counter protest balanced against the rights of the wider community.”



UK Lawyers For Israel chief executive Jonathan Turner said: “Smashing up a factory causing severe damage is hardly a peaceful protest. The reported comment of Police Scotland is out of place.

“There are plenty of ways of freely expressing criticism of the company’s activities without committing criminal offences.

“As Lord Hoffmann - one of the most liberal senior judges in recent time - observed in the leading case, R v Jones, claims of justification must be considered it the context of a functioning democratic state in which legal disputes are peacefully submitted to the courts.

“We hope that the the offenders will be prosecuted and that the Courts will pass sentences that deter any further offences of this nature.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8678836226463318}",neutral,0.8678836226463318,0

Work is underway to expand the SkyTrain system by 22 kilometres by 2028, taking it up to 106km in length.

To keep up with passenger increases, the SkyTrain expansions will require more trains and 41 new vehicles are scheduled to enter passenger service by the end of 2027.

This also equates to a need for additional train storage and maintenance. This will be provided by the fully automated OCM4, which will provide storage for 145 cars (29 trains), a vehicle interior cleaning and inspection facility, a train wash track and maintenance shops.

Activists from Palestine Action Scotland occupied Thales UK’s factory on Linthouse Road, in Govan, at around 5.20am on Monday morning.

The protesters previously made their way onto the roof in June 2022, destroying factory equipment.

Thales produces military drones, armoured vehicles and missile systems, and has eight production sites across the UK – with two in Scotland, in Glasgow and Rosyth.

The group said it targeted the company partly due to its collaboration with Israeli weapons company Elbit Systems on the Watchkeeper Drone project.

A team of four activists say they aim to “render Thales’ conveyor belt of weapons inoperable,” alongside further damages to the site facilities and a total evacuation of workers.

The activist group, which aims to “end Scottish complicity with Israeli apartheid,” also says Thales’ weapons are being used on civilians in Palestine, Iraq and Afghanistan.

A spokesperson for Palestine Action Scotland said: “The Watchkeeper Drone project seeks to further the policing and surveillance of captive populations belonging to the nations of Iraq, Palestine and Afghanistan. Watchkeeper UAVs have also been trialled over British waters by the UK Border Force, monitoring the flow of refugees seeking to enter Britain.

“The development of the Watchkeeper drone was done in cooperation by Thales and Israel’s Elbit Systems; development drew heavily on knowledge gathered from the constant use of Elbit’s Hermes 450 drones over Gaza’s skies.

“Those in Gaza will often speak of how the drone’s constant presence, including its persistent buzzing noise, induces anxiety and fear, and adds to the constant state of trauma Gaza lives in. Stories like these have prompted activists to ensure Israel’s military supply chain in Britain is struck at through direct action.

Activists have allegedly targeted a factory in Glasgow belonging to one of the world's leading suppliers of arms over claims it uses drones in the surveillance of people in Palestine.

Members of campaign group Palestine Action Scotland (PAS) allegedly scaled the roof of Thales factory in Govan at about 5.20am on Monday morning. People were pictured waving the Palestinian flag and carrying hammers.

Police Scotland confirmed three people have been arrested.

Staff members on site had to be evacuated and operations temporarily suspended as activists allegedly descended on the building and caused damage, the group said. In a tweet, PAS described Thales as having a ""killer weapons factory"" which has ""a vital link in Israel's military supply chain"" adding, ""this time, we're smashing it"".

The protesters had previously made their way onto the roof in June this year, destroying factory equipment. Police Scotland said officers were on site as the demonstration continued.

The activists have been protesting over Thales's arms productions, which include military drones and armoured vehicles, but have focused on the firm's involvement in the Watchkeeper drone scheme. The drone, which is reported to have been made in collaboration with Israel's Elbit Systems, has been used in Iraq, Afghanistan and Palestine, as well as over British waters, the group claims.

Police Scotland said officers were called to a report of a demonstration within the grounds of a business premises on Linthouse Road, Govan. PAS later confirmed that its activists were taken down from the roof of the building shortly before 5pm.

""Courageous Palestine Actionists removed from Thales arms factory roof after a good day's work halting the production of lethal military hardware,"" the group said in a tweet.

Defence contractor to be taken to court over worker's death - The Mandarin,"Mon, 04 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZW1hbmRhcmluLmNvbS5hdS8xOTM4MzItZGVmZW5jZS1jb250cmFjdG9yLXRvLWJlLXRha2VuLXRvLWNvdXJ0LW92ZXItd29ya2Vycy1kZWF0aC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Defence contractor Thales Australia is being taken to court over the death of a worker in 2020 at a manufacturing facility in Victoria, over allegations the company failed its duties under workplace safely legislation.

The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) has filed a single charge in the Bendigo Magistrates Court, following a Comcare investigation.

It is alleged Thales Australia failed to provide and maintain a safe system of work and failed to provide information and training to workers, alleging it contravened the Work Health and Safety Act 2011.

On 2 July 2020, a worker was fatally crushed after an unsecured vehicle subframe and base plate, weighing almost a tonne, fell from a paint positioner during unloading at Thales’ Bendigo North facility.

The company makes Hawkei-protected vehicles for the Australian Defence Force at that location.

At the time, a Thales spokesperson gave its condolences.

“We are deeply saddened by this tragic event at Bendigo this morning that resulted in the death of an experienced and highly valued member of our team,” a Thales spokesperson said in 2020, according to the Bendigo Advertiser.

The spokesperson added the company would be fully cooperating with authorities.

With a maximum penalty of $1.5 million, the matter is set to be listed for mention in the Bendigo Magistrates Court on August 18.

Palestine Action occupy weapons factory in Glasgow - Morning Star Online,"Mon, 11 Jul 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbW9ybmluZ3N0YXJvbmxpbmUuY28udWsvYXJ0aWNsZS9iL3BhbGVzdGluZS1hY3Rpb24tb2NjdXB5LXdlYXBvbnMtZmFjdG9yeS1pbi1nbGFzZ2930gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ACTIVISTS occupied a weapons factory in Glasgow today for a second time in just over a month.

Three members of Palestine Action Scotland climbed onto the roof of the Thales factory in the Govan area of the city in the early hours of the morning, forcing staff to evacuate.

Activists also caused “severe damage” to site facilities, the group said.

The action followed an occupation of the factory by six activists on June 1 in protest at Thales’s production of military drones that have been used in Gaza, Iraq and Afghanistan and to monitor refugees in the English Channel.

A Palestine Action spokesperson told the Morning Star: “Thales is one of the world’s largest arms companies and they work hand in hand with Elbit [Systems], manufacturing drones which have been battle-tested on the captive population of Gaza.

“Therefore, Thales is a link in Israel’s military supply chain and that’s why this action, and the last, were directed at disrupting the manufacture of weapons at Thales.”","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9802975654602051}",negative,0.9802975654602051,-1
