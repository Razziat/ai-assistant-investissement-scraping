ESA inks Meteosat contract, ending procurement turmoil

BY STEPHEN CLARK

SPACEFLIGHT NOW

Posted: February 25, 2012



The European Space Agency signed a nearly $1.8 billion contract Friday for six geostationary weather satellites, selecting Thales Alenia Space to lead an industry team building the next-generation spacecraft for launches beginning in 2017.

The agreement for the Meteosat Third Generation, or MTG, satellites will ensure continuous European weather observations through at least 2037, according to an ESA announcement. The $3.2 billion MTG program is jointly managed by ESA and Eumetsat, the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites. Most of the project is funded by ESA, which pays for up-front development costs, while Eumetsat funds sustainment, ground systems and operations. The satellites include four imaging platforms and two atmospheric sounding spacecraft stationed in geosynchronous orbit 22,300 miles above Earth's equator. The launch of the first imaging satellite, called MTG-I, is expected in 2017, followed by liftoff of a MTG-S sounding spacecraft in 2019, according to ESA. The MTG system will launch at set intervals of every few years to keep track of weather over Europe and Africa for at least two decades. The contract signing concludes a two-year political struggle over which European nations would receive the bulk of the work on the next-generation weather satellite program. France and Germany lead the European states contributing to the MTG system. ESA originally picked the bid from France-based Thales in March 2010, opting for a lower-price contract that included significant contributions from OHB System AG of Bremen, Germany. But Germany lobbied for a more extensive industrial role in the MTG program to match its funding contributions to the third-generation satellite network. The Thales-OHB bid beat out a proposal led by Germany's Astrium satellite production plants. Germany won concessions before agreeing to the French-led contractor team. The infrared sounder instrument, which will fly on two MTG satellites to measure atmospheric water vapor and wind profiles, will be built by Kayser Threde in Munich. OHB System is responsible for MTG's two sounding satellites. OHB will also supply the common satellite bus for all six MTG spacecraft, which will be three-axis stabilized. Earlier Meteosat satellites were drum-shaped spinners. Thales Alenia Space is supplying the imaging instrument for four of the MTG satellites, and leading overall development of the imaging spacecraft.

The division of work between France and Germany challenged the implementation of ESA's geographic return rule, which states member states must receive industrial work commensurate with their budget contributions. ""ESA and Eumetsat issued a request for proposals for the development of the third-generation satellites, and Thales Alenia Space was able to propose industrial partnerships meeting ESA's geographical return rule, from both the qualitative and quantitative standpoints,"" a Thales Alenia Space press release said. ""I am very proud and very honored to sign the contract for the Meteosat Third Generation program here at ESA, along with Eumetsat, CNES and Meteo France, and our German partners OHB and KT, with whom we form the 'core team',"" said Reynald Seznec, president and CEO of Thales Alenia Space. ""This contract is the culmination of a long industrial optimization approach, starting with the request for proposals,"" Seznec said in a press release. ""We are now enthusiastically looking forward to this exciting challenge, and once again demonstrating the excellence of the European space industry by delivering our accustomed world-class performance in geostationary orbit meteorology."" According to the Thales statement, the preliminary design reviews for the MTG system, instruments and platform will be completed this year. The four MTG imaging satellites will each carry a 16-channel camera to capture global snapshots every 10 minutes, with the ability to focus on local areas with greater resolution and faster image repeats. The imaging satellites will also feature lightning imagers and search-and-rescue payloads. In addition to the infrared sounder, MTG's two sounding spacecraft will each carry an ultraviolet payload for Europe's Sentinel Earth observation program to analyze atmospheric chemistry and identify trace gases, according to ESA. The MTG program continues a series of European weather satellites that began in 1977. Two Meteosat Second Generation, or MSG, satellites are now operating in space, with another MSG craft due for launch on an Ariane 5 rocket this summer. A fourth MSG satellite will blast off as soon as 2014. Thales Alenia Space has been prime contractor on all of Europe's Meteosat satellites."

While Meteosat Third Generation will ensure full continuity with the current Meteosat satellite family, it will also introduce significant improvements.

At an event held today at ESA’s headquarters in Paris, the contract between ESA and Thales Alenia Space for developing the new Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) family of satellites was signed.

Following on from Meteosat Second Generation, MTG is a cooperative venture between Eumetsat and ESA, and will ensure continuity of high-resolution meteorological data to beyond 2037.

The cooperation on meteorological missions between Eumetsat and ESA is a success story that started with the first Meteosat satellite in 1977 and continues today with Meteosat Second Generation and the polar-orbiting MetOp series.

The new series will comprise six satellites: four MTG-I imaging and two MTG-S sounding satellites.

The first two prototype satellites are scheduled for launch in late 2017 and mid-2019, respectively. Both satellites will be positioned in geostationary orbit above the equator at a longitude between 10ºE and 10ºW.

In addition to the advanced imaging capabilities offered by the Flexible Combined Imager, the satellites will offer an all-new infrared sounding capability and imaging of global lightning that will provide early warning of severe storms.

MTG-S will also carry the Sentinel-4 payload for the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) programme. This advanced payload will analyse atmospheric chemistry and identify concentrations of trace gases like ozone and nitrogen dioxide."

By J. Michael Cole / Staff Reporter





Taiwan could soon file a complaint against France over alleged illegal commissions and kickbacks surrounding the 1992 sale of 60 Mirage 2000-5 fighter aircraft, reports said yesterday.

The news comes a little more than six months after defense company Thales wired US$875 million into a Taiwanese government bank account following a decade-long legal battle over kickbacks and illegal commissions for the US$2.5 billion sale by Thomson-CSF (which became Thales in 2000) of six Lafayette-class frigates to the Taiwanese navy in 1991.

Taiwanese authorities said the documents supporting claims that illegal commissions and kickbacks were paid to arms brokers in the Mirage sale were classified and in the possession of the Ministry of National Defense, adding that their content could not currently be made public.

The International Court of Arbitration will go through the documents to determine whether the sale — part of a project codenamed Tango, which also included spare parts, maintenance and upgrades for the aircraft — involved illegal commissions and kickbacks. If the court rules that such activity did take place, France could reportedly face fines of as much as 1 billion euros (US$1.3 billion).

According to French media, the initial contract for 48 Mirage 2000-5Ei interceptors and 12 Mirage 2000-5D twin-seat trainers in 1992 amounted to 22.8 billion francs (US$4.53 billion at the time), with Dassault Aviation and Thomson-CSF as the principal contractors and Matra providing the weapons systems.

However, Taiwan paid an additional 6 billion francs for the aircraft, a discrepancy that prompted the Control Yuan in 2002 to recommend that a probe be launched. The 6 billion francs could represent the amount paid in illegal commissions and kickbacks, reports said.

The Taiwanese air force announced in May 2010 that a review of the Mirage contract had been started. Reports at the time said Andrew Wang (汪傳浦), one of the arms dealers used as an intermediary in the Lafayette scandal, might also have played a role in the Mirage sale.

According to information that could not be independently verified, French officials discreetly approached the administration of former president Chen Shui-bian (陳水扁) after 2002 to ask it to cancel any legal procedures against French defense contractors over the Lafayette and Mirage sales.

The Mirage aircraft, which remain in service, are all based in Hsinchu.

The Bureau Francais de Taipei yesterday refused to comment on the matter, telling the Taipei Times it was closely following developments on the issue.

The Paris-based Court of Arbritation last night would not confirm whether Taiwan had filed a complaint over the Mirage deal, saying that all arbitration cases were confidential."
