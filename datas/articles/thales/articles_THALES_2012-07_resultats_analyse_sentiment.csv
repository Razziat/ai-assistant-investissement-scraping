GLOW is in service with several Countries including the UK. The principle of laser warning and dazzling and the G.L.O.W. system itself has been tested and proven over a period of several years, where G.L.O.W. system prototypes have been shown to save lives in the ambiguous asymmetric situations often encountered in modern conflict. The use of the G.L.O.W. and similar systems is seen as a positive demonstration of commitment to the safety of the community in which it is being used.



It is no wonder if the UK forces dispatched and committed to provide safety and security to the London 2012 Olympic Games have been extensively provided with G.L.O.W. emitters, in both their Stand-Alone and accessory/undercarried configuration. The London Olympics are the first of the post-9/11 era to take place in a high-risk location, that has already been targeted by massive and devastating terror attacks − the 7/7/2005 London underground bombings and the 7/21/2005 attempted London underground bombing, which overall left 52 innocents and 4 suicide bombers dead and approximately 700 injuried. The 2012 Olympics also coincides with the Islamic sacred month of Ramadan, and marks 40 years from the tragic Munich 1972 Olympics, when a Black September 5-men commando attacked, kidnapped and killed eleven members of the Israeli delegation along with one German officer before being gunned down by Police. The use of high technology systems, such as the G.L.O.W., to provide additional levels of security might not be enough alone, but will sure help to make athletes and attendees feel safer.

TopOwl incorporates a night vision function: it provides the same levels of performance as the latest generation of night vision googles (NVG) with a significantly higher level of comfort for the wearer, enabling pilots to fly long missions in complete safety.

The TopOwl visor-projected intensified night vision image is a vast improvement over conventional night vision optics by providing far superior environmental perception along with excellent peripheral vision (something lacking in other systems).

TopOwl itself isn’t new, having already been combat proven in Afghanistan and Libya during night missions by attack helicopters, but it’s the first time the system is going to be used in a fixed wing aircraft.

FARNBOROUGH: Thales displays latest in IFE technology | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Mon, 09 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vZmFybmJvcm91Z2gtdGhhbGVzLWRpc3BsYXlzLWxhdGVzdC1pbi1pZmUtdGVjaG5vbG9neS8xMDU5MTIuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales has been handed the ideal opportunity to show off its latest in-flight entertainment and connectivity innovations at the show, thanks to the presence of Qatar Airways' Boeing 787.

The widebody twinjet is the first 787 to feature on-board connectivity, and the first to be equipped with Thales touch passenger media units (TPMU), a precursor to the French manufacturer's next-generation Avant IFEC system, which will make its debut towards the end of 2013 - also with Qatar Airways - on the A380.

Avant is the latest iteration of Thales' TopSeries family of IFEC systems, initially targeted at the A350, for which Qatar Airways is launch customer.

""The Avant system is the future of IFE for us,"" says Alan Pellegrini, CEO of Thales' IFEC business.

""Think of the TPMU as kind of an iPhone to not only control the system but serve as a dual entertainment device in its own right,"" he says.

""You can now get on board an aircraft and not just watch the movie in front of you, but perhaps view the moving map, play a game, or order meals or drinks simultaneously while watching what's on the main screen.""

Of the connectivity system on the Qatar 787, Pellegrini says: ""We're providing a turnkey solution that will provide both GSM and wi-fi access, using the Inmarsat satellite constellation to provide all passengers on board the aircraft with connectivity.""

The TPMUs on the Qatar 787 are integrated with the current-generation i8000 TopSeries platform, which is ""today's state of the art IFE system and is the same platform that British Airways will be taking on their 787s"", says Pellegrini.

Thales Avant The latest in IFE

A key attribute of Avant is it is based on Google's Android operating system for mobile devices.

""We want to take advantage of the Google marketplace and the ability to get more and more applications on board an IFE system sooner,"" says Pellegrini. ""We have access to all of those thousands of applications to put on the system in a much more easy manner.""

Another feature of Avant is the ability to provide up to 256GB of local solid-state storage built into the seat-mounted display.

""The storage at the seat gives us two very important things,"" says Pellegrini. ""First off, it gives us another level of redundancy. The biggest fear in our industry is what we would call a 'dark flight'. We never want an entire aircraft or row of seats to be without any form of entertainment. With seat storage at this level we can now put approximately 100 movies stored at the seat.

""It also gives the ability to create an Avant configuration that we call 'Avant light', which allows us to scale back the amount of equipment, effectively get rid of the servers, and rely exclusively on the storage at the display.

""It allows airlines that don't want to make as much investment an opportunity to have a bit of a lower cost system but with pretty much all of the same features, but rely exclusively on the seat for content.""

Meanwhile, Thales' solution for streaming video to hand-held devices in the cabin is known as Ava. It uses the same server developed to provide on-board connectivity, but to stream video to devices brought on board by passengers. Germany's Siemens has been drafted in to assist with the software, as it has experience with digital rights management in the commercial train market.

Ava is expected to be flying by the first quarter of 2013, and two unannounced customers have been secured.

""Typically, these wireless products aren't going to serve an entire long-range aircraft, but they can serve an entire short-range aircraft, and they can augment the embedded solutions in a widebody aircraft,"" says Pellegrini.

Band width and interference issues limit the number of passengers who can stream wireless content simultaneously to about 90, says Pellegrini. ""We're still trying to do things to push that envelope,"" he says.

But does state-of-the-art IFEC really hold sway over increasingly cost-conscious travellers?

BA director of engineering Garry Copeland says: ""The reasons why people buy tickets are either price, route or schedule driven, but there are an awful lot of what on one level you could regard as 'hygiene' factors that really make people come back to you, and a good in-flight experience is really powerful for getting people to come back again.

""We take IFE very seriously, but we don't want to be burdening ticket prices in a way that customers aren't prepared to accept either. It's a fine balance and something you have to think your way through very carefully,"" he says.

Watchkeeper Heading to France for Operational Trials - Defense Update,"Wed, 25 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5zZS11cGRhdGUuY29tLzIwMTIwNzI1X3dhdGNoa2VlcGVyLWZyYW5jZS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The French Ministry of Defense plans to conduct an operational assessments and flight trials of the Thales Watchkeeper Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) beginning 2012, under the 2010 Lancaster House cooperation treaty with the UK. Becoming the dominant tactical reconnaissance and target acquisition system for the British Army, the Watchkeeper UAS system currently being fielded by the British Army. The system is considered Europe’s largest and most advanced tactical UAS system. Following more than 400 missions, (of which 200 hours were performed with the Army), the Watchkeeper system continues field trials with the British Army toward its induction into service.

The announcement was made yesterday after a bi-lateral meeting in London between UK Secretary of State for Defence Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP and French Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian. The French government will allocate eight million euros for this evaluation.





Victor Chavez, Chief Executive of Thales UK, said: “The battle-winning operational edge that UAVs bring to operations is well understood and these systems are rightly a central pillar of UK-French defence collaboration. The announcement today that France will undertake trials of Watchkeeper demonstrates both nations commitment to cooperation on the battlefield and in the development of this strategically important sector”.

The French MOD is planning to expand the use of UAS in coming years. Currently the French Air Force operates the Harfang, based on the Israeli Heron I, while the Army uses the Sperwer tactical UAS (SDTI) developed by Sagem DS of France. According to plans, both systems will be replaced by enhanced systems. For replacement of the Harfang, France is considering the Heron TP, to be produced and equipped by Dassault under a cooperation with IAI while the Watchkeeper is evaluated as the SDTI successor.

On their meeting the French and British ministers agreed the the launch of another collaborative demonstration programme, for the Future Combat Air System (FCAS), an other unmanned combat air system (UCAS) that could become operational in 20-30 years time. At present the two governments agreed to spend 12 million euros ($14.5 million) with British BAE systems company and the French aircraft manufacturer Dassault Aviation, to evaluate possible designs for the FCAS. The two companies are leading parralel research programs – Taranis and Neuron, with flying demonstrators scheduled for flight trials next year.

The collaboration between the UK and France will deliver direct cost benefits, technological advances and operational flexibility to both sides, said Pierre Eric Pommellet, SVP of Thales Defence Mission Systems. “The twinning of the British Royal Artillery 32nd Regiment and the French Artillery’s 61st Regiment, whose relationship will only be deepened by joint operation of Watchkeeper, are the embodiment of the human links which are being formed across the Channel,” Pommellet added.

Victor Chavez emphasized: “Industrially, UAVs are central to the defence sector’s renewal over the next period, and there are huge opportunities for European companies to succeed in this growing market. Watchkeeper, as Europe’s largest UAS programme, positions Thales as a leading company in the design, development and deployment of UAS systems.

The delivery of Watchkeeper equipment to the British Army is on track and over 200 hours of flying trials have taken place. Watchkeeper is expected to replace the Elbit Systems Hermes 450 UAS, a Thales tactical UAV service provided as an Urgent Operational Requirement, which has already flown more than 65,000 hours in Afghanistan and Iraq, providing life-saving intelligence and reconnaissance.

The Watchkeeper system, based on an enhanced Hermed 450B air vehicle configuration, is built in the UK. This vehicle is designed as the first tactical UAV to meet European airworthiness criteria – completing over 100 flights in the UK as part of its trials programme. Its mission payloads comprises multiple high-performance sensors. The basic platform is delivered in a dual-payload configuration, that includes enhanced electro-optic / infrared sensors, with laser target designator, as well as an advanced synthetic aperture radar / ground moving target indicator radar (SAR/GMTI). The information and images collected by the airborne sensors are provided to a network of mobile ground control stations and remote viewing terminals, where UK military operators will control the whole mission and interface within a network-enabled environment. High-resolution optical and radar image exploitation and dissemination provides valuable intelligence for operational commanders.

Thales UK, as Prime Contractor for the Watchkeeper programme, will also deliver equipment, training and facilities. Production of the Watchkeeper system will take place at the joint venture company U-TacS (UAV Tactical Systems Ltd), established by Thales UK and Elbit Systems in Leicester, UK.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999864101409912}",neutral,0.9999864101409912,0
Air France 447 Report: How the Plane Went Down - The Daily Beast,"Thu, 05 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMTIvMDcvMDUvYWlyLWZyYW5jZS00NDctcmVwb3J0LWhvdy10aGUtcGxhbmUtd2VudC1kb3du0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Imagine that you have bought a new car. It’s sleek and loaded with state-of-the-art technology. There is just one drawback. It comes with a caution that under certain and statistically very unlikely circumstances the brakes will fail. Because of this, the manufacturer urges you to take special training so that, in the event that you find yourself cruising at 60 mph without brakes you can regain control. Otherwise…don’t blame us, you have been warned.

That’s not unlike the situation described by French investigators at the Bureau d’Enquetes et d’Analyses (BEA) in their third and final report issued in Paris today on the crash of Air France Flight 447 in 2009. They persist in focusing the blame on the pilots, who mishandled the plane in an emergency, rather than on a cascade of serious technical failures that they say created the emergency.

The pilots are dead and can’t answer. Whereas those who designed, manufactured, and installed apparently flawed equipment, failing to remove it when they appear to have been faced with firm evidence that its malfunction could have lethal results, may all be partly responsible for the tragedy—and have so far escaped liability. (The BEA report found some fault with Airbus, the builder of the A330. Next week in Paris, French prosecutors will announce the results of a judicial inquiry in which manslaughter charges could be filed.)

Transoceanic flights like Flight 447, which was flying from Brazil to France, are now so commonplace and safe that, at the start, the fact that one could disappear over the south Atlantic without a trace was as alarming as it seemed mysterious. It was an extraordinary achievement to find, two years later and on the fourth attempt, the wreck of the Airbus A330 lying on a sandy plain nearly 13,000 feet under the sea. The flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder survived intact, and told their tale.

They described a terrifying experience in which all 228 people aboard perished. In less than five minutes the plane had fallen 38,000 feet, hitting the water at a velocity of nearly 11,000 feet a minute, enough to compress the cargo hold upwards through the cabin floor.

Today’s final report reaffirms that the pilots, having lost the systems that normally fly the plane automatically, were unable to gain control. The plane nosed up into a high-speed stall, where the wings no longer provide lift, and never recovered from the stall.

The copilots who were in charge before the captain got back to the flight deck had had no training in manually regaining control in this type of emergency—investigators insist that had Air France prepared them with a training program the situation should have been recoverable. (Today the investigators confused this issue by telling families of the victims, in advance of the press briefing, that only a “highly-trained military pilot” could have regained control. Challenged later on this by a reporter, they then said this applied only to the final dive, not to the onset of the stall, which should have been manageable.)

Air France also said today it was already training crews how to handle similar emergencies and to recover from stalls. But the BEA report is critical of current training methods which, it says “do not test the capacity to react to the unexpected.” It calls for higher standards in the selection and training of the instructors themselves.

The events that doomed Flight 447 began with the failure of an instrument that has been around for 100 years—almost as long as the history of flight—and which, in the case of the Airbus A330, cost around $3,500.

The instrument is a pitot (pronounced peetoe) tube. It measures air speed—not ground speed, but the speed of the airplane at altitude. Every A330 has three pitot tubes positioned around the nose, beneath the cockpit. Accurate indications of air speed are crucial to the stability of the airplane—at cruise height of 35,000 feet relatively small variations in air speed, either too slow or too fast, can lead to an aerodynamic stall, as they did in the case of Flight 447.

For at least two years before the Flight 447 disaster officials at the European Aviation Safety Agency, EASA, knew there were serious problems with the model of pitot tube installed on many Air France A330s, made by the French aerospace conglomerate Thales. EASA had reports of a “significant number of events” involving the Thales tubes which left the airplanes “with a large reduction in safety margins, Aviation Weekly reported in 2009.

The Thales tubes were failing in specific conditions that foreshadowed what happened to Flight 447—at cruise height while passing through weather in which ice crystals formed, according to last year’s BEA report. (Seventy-five percent of the A330 fleet is equipped with pitot tubes made by the American company Goodrich, and these have not had the same icing problems, according to the BEA report.)

From previous events reported by aircrews of several international airlines, all the evidence suggested that sudden flash freezing, involving ice crystals, overcame the heaters in the Thales pitot tubes and sent speed measurements haywire. When fed anomalous data from the tubes, the Airbus computers that flew the airplane, via the autopilot and auto engine throttles, were programmed to shut down, leaving the pilots to fly out of the emergency the old-fashioned way: manually. In the case of Flight 447 this happened under circumstances that challenged the pilots’ spatial awareness—at night and when the airplane was flying through storm turbulence.

The basic principle of the pitot tube, invented when airplanes were built of spruce and canvas and were barely able to top 100 mph, was that a forward-facing open tube captured the air flowing around the airplane and, via simple mechanisms, the air speed appeared before a pilot as a moving needle on a dial. This principle remained the same over decades as the instrument, along with airplanes, became more and more sophisticated. It seemed very reliable.

In fact, all pitot tubes in use on airliners today have to meet a certification standard established at the onset of the jet age, in the 1960s.

Captain Louis Jobard is an Air France pilot who speaks for one of the two airline pilots’ unions in France, the Syndicat National des Pilotes de Ligne, or SNPL. He has closely followed the record of the Thales pitot tubes, and insists that the safety standards written for pitot tubes in first-generation jets in the 1960s did not anticipate the conditions encountered by modern jets flying faster, higher, and for longer over transoceanic routes.

“Changing the certification for the tubes is still under discussion, three years after the accident” he told me. “The authorities have not done their job.”

In fact, in 2008, while EASA, Air France, and Airbus were all arguing between themselves and undecided on how to respond to the growing number of reported incidents that EASA had judged to be “hazardous,” a small independent carrier operating between France and the Caribbean, Air Caraibes, acted on its own initiative after serious icing events on two of its A330s, and replaced the older Thales pitot tubes with a revised version also manufactured by Thales. (Even though this revised version has not shown the same icing problems, it is still regarded as inferior to the Goodrich design by many experts.)

Ironically, on the very day that Flight 447 disappeared, June 1, 2009, Air France began removing the suspect model Thales tubes from its A330s and replacing them with the revised version – that change had not been made on the A330 operating as Flight 447 from Rio to Paris. All the Air France Airbuses were refitted by June 12.

A little more than two months after the disaster, EASA issued a directive mandating that all existing older Thales probes immediately be replaced, and in August 2009 the FAA followed suit, with an Airworthiness Directive affecting all U.S.-registered Airbuses.

Today’s BEA report didn’t not find fault with Thales, and the company was in compliance with legal standards, however out of date those standards seem to be. European and U.S. safety standards are now supposed to move in lockstep. EASA and the FAA are jointly responsible for any changes made to the certification of pitot tubes. Alison Duquette, a spokesperson for the FAA, told me this week that “EASA is keeping the FAA informed. We are not in a position to comment on timing.”

In response to the BEA report, EASA said it was proposing new standards for flight in icing conditions, and is taking part in research on high altitude icing. Requests for comment to Thales and Airbus were not answered.

Perhaps the most elusive part of the tragedy of Flight 447 is what exactly was it in the storm system that developed that night over the South Atlantic that decided the fate of 228 people?

Immediately after the disaster, Tim Vasquez, an expert in forecasting weather for airline routes, found high-definition satellite images of that storm system and, combining them with other weather data, constructed a vivid picture of the storm cells that had been cooking up for hours that night across the route between South America and Europe. He posted them on his website, along with some recondite weather-buff discussion and analysis.

The storm was typical of those found at the time of year in the intertropical convergence zone, where Atlantic trade winds meet equatorial systems. On the night of June 1, 2009, other flights ahead and behind Flight 477 had noted the formidable line of storms and turbulence, as did the crew of Flight 447 in the minutes before their computers quit.

Vasquez, who updated his research in response to data recovered from the flight recorders of Flight 447, ruled out lightning as a cause. One of his graphics shows that at the heart of the storm the roiling clouds rose to 20,000 feet above the flight path. He concluded that turbulence, and possibly icing, “created the initial problem that led to a failure cascade.”

It was highly likely that sudden contrasts in high altitude temperatures, generated by the proximity of warm updrafts and cold downdrafts generated by the convection of air masses, created in one small piece of the sky and for a very short time the icing conditions that lay in wait for Flight 447, according to Vasquez.

But why did icing suddenly appear four or five years ago as a threat to flights through this and other storm-prone regions? Captain Jobard—along with others who have tried to explain this riddle—wondered whether global warming might be a factor. “It seems,” he told me, “that there is an increase in these kinds of storms.”

But Tim Vasquez does not agree. “I think we may be experiencing a climate shift” he says, “but this would not have any measurable effect on small scale processes like thunderstorms. Airliners all over the world go through a wide range of ice and water regimes every day, and there would be nothing new in what Flight 447 experienced.”","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.6526657938957214}",negative,0.6526657938957214,-1

"Boeing 787 Dreamliner: Powered by Android, and 69TB of solid-state storage - ExtremeTech","Thu, 12 Jul 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV4dHJlbWV0ZWNoLmNvbS9hZXJvc3BhY2UvMTMyNzIxLWJvZWluZy03ODctZHJlYW1saW5lci1wb3dlcmVkLWJ5LWFuZHJvaWQtYW5kLTY5dGItb2Ytc29saWQtc3RhdGUtc3RvcmFnZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is the most-anticipated wide-bodied jet of all time: Boeing has taken a total of 859 orders since 2004, and so far it has only delivered 14 planes. By end of 2013 it intends to ramp up production to 10 units per month, but even then, most customers still have a wait time of between 5 and 10 years. This isn't a story about the Dreamliner's composite body, or the fact that it uses 20% less fuel than a 767, though: Inside all 859 of those planes, each and every seat will be outfitted with an Android-powered entertainment system.

Boeing is offering two flavors of in-flight entertainment and connectivity (IFEC) solutions: The Thales TopSeries Avant, and the Panasonic eX3. Other than it being Android-based, we don't have any details on the eX3 -- but, rather conveniently, two days ago, Qatar Airways showed off its recently-delivered 787 Dreamliner at the Farnborough International Airshow in the UK -- and inside there are 254 seats, all equipped with the Thales IEFC.

There are two classes in the Qatar Airways 787, business and economy, and they're outfitted with 17-inch and 10-inch touchscreen IEFCs respectively. The IEFCs are completely integrated -- all of the hardware is stored in the seat-back unit (there's no under-seat box). And the hardware spec... well, this is the bit that blew my mind. Each IEFC has an STMicro dual-core ARM processor, 1GB of RAM, and a 256GB (!) SSD. There's also a main server, which features 32 x86 cores (so, quad-CPU Xeon or Opteron), 128GB of RAM, and a further 4TB of SSD storage. Optionally, the Avant can be equipped with what looks like a pull-out Android handset (a Touch Passenger Media Unit) -- presumably for running Android apps that aren't suited to the large screen.

Software-wise, we don't know much beyond the fact that both the Thales and Panasonic units will run a customized version of Android. Given the time frame, we're probably talking about Android 2.3 or 3.0 -- but looking at the photo above (larger), which looks nothing like Android except for the three buttons in the bottom right corner, Thales is probably just using Android because a) it's free, and b) it has a large software ecosystem that passengers can leverage.

All told, a Qatar Airways Dreamliner has 508 ARM cores, 32 x86 cores, 382GB of RAM, and 69 terabytes of solid-state storage. Apparently the planes will also be outfitted with WiFi -- no surprise there -- and 3G GSM, presumably via a GSM microcell, which bounces phone calls and data off a satellite and back down to earth. You should be able to make normal telephone calls on your mobile phone, perhaps even without incurring additional fees -- except during taxi, take off, and landing, of course. British Airways is also expected to use the Thales system in its Boeing 787s (and in its Airbus A380s) when they roll out next year.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999783039093018}",neutral,0.9999783039093018,0
