Thales Plans Next Steps in GNSS Technology Evolution - Inside GNSS,"Wed, 30 May 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlZ25zcy5jb20vdGhhbGVzLXBsYW5zLW5leHQtc3RlcHMtaW4tZ25zcy10ZWNobm9sb2d5LWV2b2x1dGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales TOPSTAR 100 receiver

French manufacturer Thales, the only non-U.S. company to offer GPS SAASM (Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module) receivers, is working on next-generation receivers for commercial aviation and military markets that will incorporate new signals and multiple GNSS systems.

Since the late 1990s, the company has delivered between 8,000 and 10,000 avionics installations in military and civil domains, according to Pierre Bouniol, GNSS Products Department manager, including multi-mode GPS receivers in stand-alone and enclosure configurations.



French manufacturer Thales, the only non-U.S. company to offer GPS SAASM (Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module) receivers, is working on next-generation receivers for commercial aviation and military markets that will incorporate new signals and multiple GNSS systems.

Since the late 1990s, the company has delivered between 8,000 and 10,000 avionics installations in military and civil domains, according to Pierre Bouniol, GNSS Products Department manager, including multi-mode GPS receivers in stand-alone and enclosure configurations.

The company’s military receivers, such as the GNSS 1000-S, have found a home on board FREMM multi-mission frigates, cruise missiles, Tiger helicopters, C-135 fuel-tanker aircraft, Atlantique-2 marine patrol aircraft, and Mirage 2000D fighters in service with the French armed forces. Thales’ stand-alone or integrated inertial navigation systems have been selected by more than 10 different nations for installation on board maritime vessels and aircraft, says Philippe Laviron, head of navigation marketing for the company.

The Way Ahead. Now Thales is looking to GNSS systems such as Europe’s Galileo and Russia’s GLONASS to provide an expanded technology base for its next generation of military and commercial equipment. The company already has a solid history with the Galileo program, supplying a signal generator for navigation payloads on Galileo satellites as well as a control segment receiver and test receiver equipment for the Galileo user segment.

Within three to four years, the company expects to have certified aviation equipment that meets technical standard order (TSO) specifications and operate with Galileo as well as GPS signals. According to Thales, the receivers will incorporate civil signals on Galileo E1/E5 and counterpart GPS L1/L5 bands allocated to safety-of-life aeronautical radionavigation services. Bouniol says the receivers will also be hardware-compatible with GLONASS and China’s BeiDou.

On the military side, capabilities planned for development include Military Standard Order 129 (MSO, the military version of TSOs) versions that will enable aircraft to fly in non-segregated (civil and military) airspace. Updated military receivers will introduce new NAVWAR functions, such as direct Y-code acquisition and additional anti-jamming capabilities.

New Chip. In a presentation at this year’s European Navigation Conference (ENC 2012), David Depraz, a manager for Thales GNSS Engineering Service, described the company’s development of a new, integrated RF front-end chip for down-conversion and amplification of GNSS signals. Called ARAMIS (Analogue Radionavigation ASIC for Multiconstellation Signals), the chip is designed to address the needs of demanding high-end applications, such safety-of-life certified receivers used in commercial aviation or crypto receivers used in governmental avionics.

Further ahead, by 2017 Thales expects to integrate Galileo’s public regulated service (PRS) and the next-generation military GPS M-code into dual-mode receivers, says Laviron.

Meanwhile, the company continues to gain business with its existing product offerings. Thales recently received a contract from the Service Industriel de l’Aéronautique (SIAé) — France’s military aircraft maintenance, repair, and overhaul service — to supply stand-alone GPS receivers for the French Navy’s Lynx helicopters, which are currently being upgraded by the French defense procurement agency (DGA). In May, Thales announced that Embraer Defence and Security had awarded the company to provide the inertial navigation system — Thales’ High Performance Inertial Reference System (HPIRS) — and the GPS equipment for the KC-390 military transport aircraft.

Thales’ SAASM-enabled receiver has security approval by both the GPS Directorate and the DGA. The company also offers a C/A-code + GLONASS receiver for countries not allowed to use GPS Y-code (encrypted P-code) military signals."
Republic of Korea Navy orders Thales minesweeping equipment - Navy Recognition,"Tue, 22 May 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL25hdnlyZWNvZ25pdGlvbi5jb20vaW5kZXgucGhwL25hdmFsLW5ld3MvbmF2YWwtbmV3cy1hcmNoaXZlL3llYXItMjAxMi1uZXdzL21heS80NTctcmVwdWJsaWMtb2Yta29yZWEtbmF2eS1vcmRlcnMtdGhhbGVzLW1pbmVzd2VlcGluZy1lcXVpcG1lbnQuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales has been awarded a contract to supply minesweeping equipment for the Republic of Korea Navy’s (ROKN) new Mine Sweeper Hunters. The contract signed with ITT Corporation (now ITT Exelis) is for the supply of three ship sets of Advanced Acoustic Generators (AAGs) from Thales in Australia.





These will be provided by ITT Exelis to GMB USA, which is the prime contractor for the ROKN’s Mine Sweeper Hunter (MSH) Combined Influence Sweep (CIS) project.



Jean Pellegrin, Thales Country Director South Korea, said: “The ROKN has committed to having the most advanced minesweeping technology, which is also in service with the Royal Australian Navy, the United States Navy, and two other navies.”



“As new mine-related threats emerge, it is vitally important to deploy cutting-edge systems that deliver innovative and flexible capabilities to friendly naval forces on operations. We are extremely proud to be a part of the ROKN’s capability in this area.”



Chris Jenkins, Thales Australia’s CEO, said: “This technology is the result of close cooperation with Australia’s Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO), as well as a long term investment to develop innovative, specialised solutions at our facility in Sydney, Australia. We believe the AAG is well suited to the export market, and this contract reflects growing international interest in our minesweeping systems.”"
How to simulate a light armoured vehicle - The Register,"Mon, 14 May 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlZ2lzdGVyLmNvbS8yMDEyLzA1LzE0L2FzbGF2X3NpbXVsYXRvci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Australian Light Armoured Vehicle (ASLAV) is an eight-wheeled, 13,450-kilogram monster, which bristles with a grenade launcher, a pair of machine guns and a 25 millimetre M242 “Bushmaster” chain gun.

The ASLAV can carry six troops in addition to its three crew. Two of the latter ride inside the vehicle's turret, where the Gunner must be able to aim the Bushmaster in accordance with the instructions of fellow turret-dweller, the Crew Commander.

Australia has a large fleet of ASLAVs – more than 250 are in service – with many currently deployed in places like Afghanistan.

The vehicles get a lot of use, so it makes sense to use simulators for training. Thales Australia built the first nine such machines and has recently been engaged to build another set. When we heard that news, we decided to ask them how they'll do it.

The answers, provided by Tony Landers, Thales Australia’s Director of Business Development - Maritime & Aerospace, are revealing. But not too revealing – in order to write this story we had to agree to vetting by the Australian Department of Defence.

So what did we learn? Well … we expected the simulator would re-create the interior of the ASLAV, which indeed features a mock ammo belt for the Bushmaster and other similarly high-verisimilitude accoutrements.

What we didn't expect was Landers' insight that manufacturers of the various internal fittings of vehicles like the ASLAV now have half an eye on simulation market. Some items in the mocked-up interiors of the simulators are therefore identical to those found in actual vehicles, save for their simulator-ready USB interfaces.

The new simulators will also be joined, for the first time, by a desktop tool that runs on touch screens instead of a mock vehicle.

An Australian Light Armoured Vehicle

Which is not to say that assembling a simulator is as simple as daisy-chaining a stack of USB hubs: there's still plenty of bespoke electronics work to be done, which Landers explains in the context of the ASLAV's periscope. “We designed optical paths to LCD screens sitting at the end of tube that simulates a periscope,” he explains. “We built all the I/O and control it from the application software on the servers.” A team of nearly 30 spent three years building that kind of thing for the first nine simulators.

That team was helped by a Thales product called SETHI product that simulates a battlefield environment, animating enemies with artificial intelligence while creating a realistic 3D world.

The tricky part of building simulators, Landers says, is not necessarily the hardware or software. Instead, he says “the devil is in the detail, especially understanding the level of fidelity you need to teach the student the task. You could spend a large fortune simulating every element of a device to 100% accuracy, but that might not be required for training. You need to understand training design to understand what to build.”

For the ASLAV simulator, that means a “motion platform” that simulates working in a moving vehicle is not necessary. Students do get haptic feedback from the Bushmaster, but it is not felt that making the simulator rock and roll has a training benefit.

The new generation of simulators will refine the work from the first nine units. An important refinement will only be visible in the server rack that powers the sim. SETHI runs across almost two dozen servers which live in the same shipping container that houses the simulators. Landers said the servers run a mix of Windows and Linux, pack the most powerful graphics cards available at the time of building and house a number of virtual machines. The next-generation design requires just over a dozen servers, a number that has come down thanks to virtualisation."

CEA-Leti and III-V lab reports significant results after one year of collaborative research programme: The partnership has leveraged the expertise of the different players in optoelectronics, microelectronics and heterogeneous integration

Grenoble, France | Posted on May 9th, 2012

In an effort to bring the performance benefits of III-V components on to silicon CMOS platforms, the partnership leverages the different expertise and know-how of Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs France, Thales Research and Technology and CEA-Leti in optoelectronics, microelectronics and heterogeneous integration, to innovate in four primary areas of research and markets. After a year, the III-V Lab has already enabled the rapid development of a common platform for optoelectronic and microelectronic technology. CEA-Leti and III-V lab are able to unveil the first results:



Photonic integrated circuits (PIC) that gather the active and passive functions of III-V and silicon for high-speed telecommunications and data transfer. For the first time, a tunable laser source has been integrated on silicon, which represents a key milestone towards fully integrated transceivers. CEA-Leti and III-V lab have now made a significant breakthrough in its development by integrating on the same chip complex devices such as a fully integrated transmitter working above 10Gb/s or a tunable single wavelength laser.



Near-infrared imaging for security and defence applications. The III-V lab and LETI are developing new types of detectors with increased resolution and operating in eye-safe region of the infrared spectra. They have demonstrated a fully operating imaging system, and developed the first elements of the molecular bonding of the retina on the reading circuit, a step required in order to lower significantly the cost of the system.



A new generation of cost-effective, multi-spectral, compact, ultra-sensitive, highly-selective gas sensors for use in security, industrial process control, and environmental monitoring. Thanks to the collaboration between LETI and III-V lab, it has been possible to demonstrate the basic passive components required for the realisation of the PIC based gas sensor.



The high-power GaN-based microelectronics research program has demonstrated the first results on high mobility transistors with low leakage and normally OFF architecture, and the realisation of the first high power driving systems.



""The collaboration between LETI and III-V lab creates a unique environment in terms on complementarities of competences and technologies"" explained Salvatore Cinà, Deputy Head of the Optoelectronics Department at CEA-Leti. ""It allows for the integration of the optoelectronics and high mobility properties of the III-V materials on the advanced 200 and 300 mm microelectronics platforms of Silicon, allowing for the large scale development of advanced integrated circuits""

SA Army gains Cytoon - defenceWeb,"Tue, 29 May 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuY2V3ZWIuY28uemEvbGFuZC9sYW5kLWxhbmQvc2EtYXJteS1nYWlucy1jeXRvb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The South African Army will this afternoon officially receive its new tactical intelligence system acquired over the last several years under Project Cytoon.

The SA Army Tactical Intelligence Corps last year began operational testing and evaluation of the system that was project managed by Thales South Africa. A company spokesman last July said testing had begun in August 2010 and was by September “going fairly well.”

Project Cytoon will see the gain 14 Thales Squire (pictured) ground surveillance radars, 65 Thales Sophie thermal imagers, processors and communications equipment as part of a battlefield surveillance and mobile intelligence processing system. “Thales has teamed up with various local and international partners whose products have also been integrated,” the company said at the Africa Aerospace & Defence exhibition in Cape Town in September. “The system has been designed to address the exclusive intelligence requirements of the SANDF, and in doing so established a unique state of the art intelligence gathering system. Project Cytoon has been completed and is ready for commissioning into the SANDF. Operational field tests are being conducted at this moment where-after the SANDF will receive the system. The system will be complemented soon with the delivery of a training system to support the specific training needs of the South African Army Intelligence Formation.”"
