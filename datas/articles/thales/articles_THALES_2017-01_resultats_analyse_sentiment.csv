The Most Difficult Thing in Life - Boundless.org,"Tue, 03 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvdW5kbGVzcy5vcmcvYmxvZy90aGUtbW9zdC1kaWZmaWN1bHQtdGhpbmctaW4tbGlmZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"One of my friends told me she learned a lot about herself by being married; in such close quarters, it’s hard to hide anything about yourself, and your constant companion makes you think about your personality and behavior more.

I never really thought about the value of self-awareness until after she brought this up. I became more aware after I made a couple close friendships that involved sacrifice and vulnerability. As an unmarried 27-year-old, I haven’t had a spouse to highlight my personality traits. But since developing those close relationships, I’ve determined the value of, as Socrates put it, “knowing thyself.”

Socrates argued that knowing yourself was the key to wisdom. Saint Augustine wrote about the importance of self-awareness in order to understand God better, praying, “Lord, let me know myself; let me know you.” Thales of Miletus, a Greek philosopher, said, “The most difficult thing in life is to know yourself.”

While the latter statement is debatable, as someone who is not very self-aware and has trouble coming to terms with weakness, I acknowledge the challenge. I’ve come to realize it’s good practice to understand our strengths and weaknesses as Christ-followers.

Using Your Strengths

Knowing what you are good at feels great. If you’ve ever received those warm fuzzy notes from people in your dorm room or small group about what they like about you, you know what I’m talking about. It’s nice to be affirmed, and even nicer when you’re surprised by a positive comment someone makes about you. One of my college roommates told me I had a peaceful presence. So my introversion didn’t make her feel awkward, but she actually felt calmed by it!? Cool. (Another roommate described me as “a bit of a nut,” but I already knew that.)

As Christ-followers, focusing on our own happiness and on feeling good about ourselves is not our purpose. However, simply being aware of our strengths doesn’t mean we are being arrogant. We can use those abilities to encourage others and to delight God. For example, one of my gifts is creativity. As a writer and graphic designer, I use this every day in my work, but it also empowers my imagination and compassion; this makes me a good listener for others, a thoughtful gift-giver, and inspires me to create things others can find encouragement from.

Knowing Your Weaknesses

By understanding myself, I get a better idea of what a flawed person I am, and that’s a good thing. John Piper writes about taking an eight-month leave of absence from his pastoral duties to understand his strengths and weaknesses better—“I wanted to know my most intransigent sins. And I wanted to make war on them in fresh ways.”

I like that idea of making war with my sins. I don’t have to just sit there and let them fester.

If you don’t have a spouse to help you out, developing close friendships is a great way to highlight your weaknesses. When you spend a lot of time with someone, and more importantly, when you are vulnerable with them, you learn a lot about yourself.

Personally, in the past few years I learned about my own tendency to be extremely private about my life. Privateness is not necessarily a sin, but it was detrimental to my close relationships. When sharing is always one-sided, when one person’s being vulnerable and another never is, there is a problem.

Even taking personality quizzes (you know, the ones your bosses make you take and you secretly have fun doing) helped me recognize a few things about myself, things I already knew but had never taken the time to define or think about (I’m an INFJ, by the way, which freakily describes my personality to a T). One of my biggest issues is perfectionism, which again, isn’t necessarily bad. But when it started getting in the way of my compassion because I was focusing on the quality of the project and not caring who got hurt along the way, I realized it was something I needed to work on.

Other issues I have, things that I’ve learned by working closely with others and being more aware of my reactions, are pride, sullenness, quickness to blame, passive aggressiveness, and sensitivity to criticism (but that’s been mostly crushed out of me as a writer).

It’s so much easier to address these tendencies, i.e. wage war with them, when I am aware of them in the first place. When we remain ignorant of ourselves, it can be easy to put ourselves on a pedestal and think we’re perfect. It’s awareness of our sinful nature that makes us crave God’s forgiveness and His touch on our life, and ignorance of it can strengthen resistance to that. And the cool thing is, God uses our weaknesses (which, though I can work on them and become better at fighting, I will never be completely rid of) to remind us of the power of Christ: “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness” (2 Corinthians 12:9). Perhaps that is the most difficult thing in life, giving ourselves up to Christ to become perfect in our weaknesses.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.985325813293457}",neutral,0.985325813293457,0
A Libertarian Builds Low-Cost Private Schools for the Masses - Reason,"Mon, 23 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vcmVhc29uLmNvbS92aWRlby8yMDE3LzAxLzIzL3RoYWxlcy1hY2FkZW15LW5vcnRoLWNhcm9saW5hLWJvYi1sdWRkeS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bob Luddy was tired of trying to convince North Carolina educrats to improve the state's public schools, so he built his own network of low-cost private schools that the government can't meddle with.

A libertarian businessman based in Raleigh, North Carolina, Luddy made his fortune as the owner of the nation's leading manufacturer of commercial kitchen ventilation systems. CaptiveAire has factories in six states, and its 2016 revenues were $400 million. But what does fabricating stove hoods and building HVAC systems have in common with turning out successful students? More than you might think.

Luddy became interested in education when he observed that many hires at CaptiveAire lacked the basic math and science skills to thrive on the job. He volunteered to co-chair a statewide education commission and met with North Carolina officials to voice his concerns. ""They were happy to discuss all of these ideas,"" Luddy says, ""but they weren't going to implement any of them.""

The last straw for Luddy came in 1997, when he ran for a seat on the local school board and lost. It turned out to be a ""great blessing,"" he says, because it led him to start focusing on creating alternatives to the traditional public schools.

Almost immediately, he filed a charter for Franklin Academy, which today is the third largest charter school in North Carolina, with about four applicants vying for every kindergarten spot.

But Luddy wasn't satisfied. ""Charters are far better than the [traditional] public system,"" Luddy says, ""however, there's still regulation…and over time, the bureaucrats are going to continue to load more regulation on charters.""

In 2007, he decided to take a more radical step by creating a non-profit network of schools called Thales Academy. Influenced by economist Albert Hirschman's classic 1970 treatise on political science, Exit, Voice and Loyalty, Luddy conceived of Thales as a way to give families ""exit.""

""'Voice' is [when] you go to vote [or you] express an opinion…Exit…is like Uber…where someone comes up with an entirely new idea, they bypass the existing industry, and they get amazing results.""

It was necessary to set the cost of attending Thales within reach of most families. Tuition is $5,300 for elementary school, and $6,000 for junior high and high school. At that price point, Thales is able to cover its costs with only a few exceptions: It takes advantage of North Carolina's tax-exempt financing for school construction, and Luddy himself makes a one-time contribution to help defray capital costs with each new facility. Luddy also provides about 6 percent of the student body with financial aid that covers up to half the cost of tuition, and 34 students (1.5 percent) receive financial aid through North Carolina's Opportunity Scholarship Program.[*]

So how does Thales get by with so little revenue? (North Carolina's public schools spent about $9,300 per pupil in the 2015-2016 school year.) One factor is that it doesn't serve kids with severe learning disabilities who are more expensive to educate. Luddy believes those students are best served through North Carolina's school voucher program.

Another way Thales saves money is by spending significantly less on infrastructure than the public system. In 2013, the town of Rolesville, North Carolina got a new public high school that cost $76 million. A year later, Thales opened a $9 million high school two-and-a-half miles away. Though much smaller, when divided by the number of students each building can accommodate, the Thales school cost half as much. One difference is that Rolesville High School has tennis courts, a football field, and a baseball diamond. ""Modern day public schools,"" says Luddy, look more like ""sports complexes.""

Thales schools also have no auditoriums because they're too expensive to build, heat, and cool.

Another savings is on personnel. There's no cafeteria, and thus no cafeteria staff. There are no school buses, and thus no school bus drivers. There's also hardly any support staff, and fewer actual teachers. Thales targets a teacher to student ratio of about 26 to one, compared to one teacher for every 15 kids in North Carolina's traditional public schools.

Most schools boast about small class sizes, but Luddy is proud of having large classes because it demonstrates efficiency, in the same way that when CaptiveAire can produce more stove hoods with fewer employees, the savings ultimately get passed on to customers. Thales is able to accommodate larger class sizes by grouping kids in the same classroom who have roughly the same command of the material. This way they can all follow the lesson with less individual attention from the teacher. It's part of a pedagogical approach called ""direct instruction,"" which Luddy believes provides a superior education in a more efficient manner.

""In business we look at outcomes,"" Luddy says, ""did we gain sales, did we please our customers? Schools don't look at it this way. We have a big building. We have sports. They're all inputs.""

As Thales enters its tenth year of operation, Luddy and his team have grand ambitions. There are currently 25 new Thales schools in the planning stages that would extend the network's reach into Georgia, Tennessee, and Florida.

""The old educational establishment is gradually declining,"" says Luddy, ""so one of my goals is to be a shining example of what can be done so that others will follow.""

Factory of the Future: robotic SAPHIR system in operation - Thales,"Fri, 20 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbmV3cy9mYWN0b3J5LWZ1dHVyZS1yb2JvdGljLXNhcGhpci1zeXN0ZW0tb3BlcmF0aW9u0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"You may have read media reports on SAPHIR, an industrial project that kicked off two years ago, and uses robots to make the structural panels for satellites. Today, the SAPHIR system, comprising two robotic arms working collaboratively, is in service in the clean rooms at Thales Alenia Space’s plant in Cannes, southern France.

SAPHIR is a robotic system designed to automate the installation of inserts in the structural panels for telecommunications satellites.



The system is based on a workstation with two robotic arms: one prepares the work, the other installs the inserts. This project, which reflects our teams’ industrial expertise, will considerably reduce the time needed to bond the 3,500 inserts needed on each panel. The aim is to reduce the cycle from three weeks and two employees working continuously, to one week for a single operator.



It’s also worth noting that the SAPHIR system, in addition to improving reliability and reducing cycles and costs, will free operators from these repetitive tasks and allow them to focus on more complex, and higher value-added production tasks.

Spearheading the Factory of the Future

The SAPHIR project is an integral part of a comprehensive strategic initiative, the “Factory of the Future”, based on innovation at all levels. In today’s fiercely competitive telecom satellite market, it is imperative for companies to produce better, faster and cheaper! Automation is one solution for manufacturers to accelerate satellite production in today’s fast-evolving industrial environment. The idea behind the Factory of the Future is to introduce state-of-the-art technologies into the production process.



There has been a host of innovations in recent years, including additive manufacturing, augmented reality, connected objects, and the introduction of robots and cobots (robots designed to operate in conjunction with humans) in assembly and integration facilities. The clean rooms at Thales Alenia Space are definitely future facing!



The SAPHIR system is a response to a production challenge: how can we accelerate the installation of inserts in structural panels for telecom satellite payloads? It was developed in collaboration with AKEO+ [robot integrator] and Avantis Concept [development of the new insert and its applicator], and represents a real disruptive advance. The underlying idea was not to automate a manual process, but rather to design a new insert and bonding process compatible with robotization.

This is one of the first installations in Europe capable of carrying out this type of task for the space industry. SAPHIR’s technology was qualified just a few weeks ago: Thales Alenia Space produced a flight-standard panel with automated installation of the inserts for the Bangabandhu telecom satellite.



SAPHIR is now up and running! But it’s also worth noting that each satellite is unique. The production phases still demand a high degree of operator dexterity (not unlike turning out high fashion clothes). The introduction of a system like SAPHIR, especially in the space sector, can legitimately be considered a technological tour de force!



While the SAPHIR system currently focuses on installing inserts, the field of potential applications is vast indeed. A similar system will almost certainly be implemented in the near future for other applications, such as panel markings (which enables locating upcoming operations on the panels), or for applications in other areas, such as constellations or Earth observation satellites.

France Orders 105 Spy'Ranger Drones From Thales - Defense News,"Thu, 05 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXIvMjAxNy8wMS8wNS9mcmFuY2Utb3JkZXJzLTEwNS1zcHktcmFuZ2VyLWRyb25lcy1mcm9tLXRoYWxlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — France has ordered 105 Spy'Rangers from electronics company Thales, with the first miniature drones to be delivered by 2019, the defense procurement office announced on Thursday.



""The Direction Générale de l'Armement ordered Dec. 21, 2016, from Thales the production of the mini drone reconnaissance system,"" the DGA said in a statement. ""The first systems will be delivered between now and 2019 and will benefit from 10 years of maintenance."" A system comprises three UAVs.



There was an initial acquisition of 35 UAV systems, with a further 35 under option, bringing the total to 70 systems, or 210 units, worth a total of €104.3 million (US $108.8 million), a source close to the deal said.



The DGA declined to comment on the value of the deal.



""Starting in 2018, Thales will provide French forces up to 210 mini reconnaissance UAVs,"" the electronics company said in a statement. Each UAV system includes the ground segment and technical support.



Winning a French contract is a big boost to export prospects, with Thales pitching the Spy'Ranger in four to six foreign military tenders, Pascal Sécretin, Thales manager of the mini-UAV product line, told journalists. The drone will be on display at upcoming trade shows in India and the United Arab Emirates.





The mini UAV is essentially ""made in France,"" with the batteries the sole imported equipment, he said.

A French product is critical as employment is seen as a key political requirement in arms acquisition. A previous pick of the Patroller, a tactical UAV from Safran Electronics & Defense, over the competing British Watchkeeper from Thales has been seen as reflecting a preference for a national weapon system over imports.

The Spy'Ranger aircraft has been designed to a high, robust level, with a retractable sensor pod and an airframe built from reinforced carbon-carbon, which operates silently with an electric engine, said Eric Rantet, chairman and chief executive of Aviation Design, the aircraft builder who has partnered with Thales.

Thales designed the mini UAV based on lessons learned and also what the French Army might need in the next 10 years, said Jean-Pascal Arrou-Vignod, Thales vice president in charge of electro-optical business.

The mini-drone reconnaissance system will equip the services and succeeds the Drac system, which entered service with the Army in 2008, the DGA said. Thales developed Spy'Ranger with two small and medium French companies, with the airframe from Aviation Design and electro-optical pod from Merion.

A selection of Thales displaces Airbus Defence & Space, which had pitched the SkyGhost from its subsidiary Survey Copter. In 2005, Airbus DS won the Drac contract worth €30 million.

The electro-optical sensor has a visual sensitivity previously only available on a higher segment, the DGA said. The mini UAV has an operating range of 30 kilometers, delivers a high-definition, day-and-night capability, with a wingspan of 3.8 meters, weighing 14.5 kilograms, and can stay aloft for two and a half hours. Thales will supply the secure, real-time video datalink, based on technology from Elsa, a DGA-funded research project.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9990193843841553}",neutral,0.9990193843841553,0

Thales’s latest-generation Spy’Ranger mini surveillance and reconnaissance Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has been chosen by the French Defence Procurement Agency (DGA) to equip the French forces. Up to 70 mini-UAV reconnaissance systems (SMDR) will be made available from 2018. Each system consists of three mini-UAVs, a ground segment and the associated technical support.

Starting in 2018, Thales will provide French forces up to 210 mini reconnaissance UAVs.

The Spy’Ranger is the new ‘eye in the sky’ for the combined arms tactical group, able to be operated in a standalone mode or connected to a C4I[1] system.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZGyva_2pIk

The Spy’Ranger is specifically tailored to the needs of the armed forces, as well as to those of essential operators.

The Armed forces require real-time access to ever more reliable imagery. Spy’Ranger will provide them with a decisive tactical advantage by offering the capacity to observe day or night, for long periods of time and at a distance of up to 30 km. Spy’Ranger is used in particular to carry out the following missions: provide support to a combined arms tactical group maneuver or to an offensive reconnaissance mission; provide a cover mechanism, support the neutralisation of strong points and contribute to firing maneuvers by providing a “remote airborne eye” able to adjust shooting rounds on a target.

Developed by Thales in cooperation with French SMEs Aviation Design and Merio in under 13 months, Spy’Ranger will offer French Forces a number of innovations that provide real capability gains. Spy’Ranger will therefore markedly contribute to the gathering of frontline intelligence and to the protection of forces in operation.

Jean-Pascal Arrou-Vignod, Thales VP in charge of Optronics business

The Spy’Ranger, developed by Thales in collaboration with several French SMEs, is a mini-UAV designed and manufactured in France. Spy’Ranger packs state-of-the-art technologies that provide much better performance:

Transportable in a backpack, Spy’Ranger can perform observation missions over a period of 2 hours 30 minutes, covering a range of 30 km: a much larger surveillance area than those covered by systems currently in service;

Its gyrostabilized multi-sensor optronic payload has the highest resolution in the world for this range of platform, facilitating the positive identification of zones or objects over which it has flown;

Its tactical data link, protected to the highest standard, offers high speeds allowing the transmission of a high-definition image streams;

Its command and control software (C2) provides an effective user interface;

A mobile and digital support management system, based on Thales’s Smartfleet solution, that enables efficient execution and piloting of the Through Life Support’s.

Fully adapted to frontline air-land intelligence missions in battlefields in hostile environments (climate, electromagnetic, physical, etc.), the Spy’Ranger has been designed to optimise life cycle costs.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996418952941895}",neutral,0.9996418952941895,0
Spy’Ranger – a New Mini-Drone for the French Army - Defense Update,"Thu, 05 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5zZS11cGRhdGUuY29tLzIwMTcwMTA1X3NweXJhbmdlci5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The French defense procurement agency (DGA) selected Thales to provide up to 70 ‘Spy’Ranger’ Mini-Drone Reconnaissance Systems (SMDR) for the French Army. Induction of the first batch of 35 systems is expected to begin in 2019. The total cost of the contract, with options, could reach €104.3 million (US $108.8 million).

Each Spy’Ranger system consists of three drones, a ground segment (launcher, control unit, and communications module) and associated technical support. Its man-portable configuration consists of two drones and the ground segment packed in two backpacks weighing 25kg each. Thales developed the Spy’Ranger system in less than 13 months, under a cooperation Thales established with two small French companies – Aviation Design and Merio. The Spy’Ranger will equip the services and succeeds the Airbus DS Drac system, which entered service with the Army in 2008. The Spy’Ranger won over the rival Airbus and SurveyCopter that offered the SkyGhost ER.

The French army required a reconnaissance system that consists of mini-UAVs that can operate in day and night over a distance of up to 30 km, with an endurance of 150 minutes. The drone’s maximum take-off weight is 14kg, including payload weighing up to 1.2 kg. Battery powered and electrically propelled, it is inaudible at 200 meters. The Spy’Ranger has a wing span of 3.8 meters; it can operate at an altitude of 4,500 above sea level, at speed up to 90 km/h. Its endurance is 180 minutes. The drone can operate at wind conditions below 19 m/s. According to Thales, the system operation is simple and does not require special skills.

Mission preparation would usually take about 12 minutes, preparing the mini-drone to launch from a light ramp provided with the system. Once airborne Spy’Ranger is fully autonomous, operated by a single operator. Operating options include assisted modes, providing dynamic route selection to follow moving targets. The system also employs electronic stabilization, automatic target detection, geotracking, and video tracking.

The mini-drone carries a single gyro-stabilized multi-sensor electro-optical payload and protected, tactical datalink that transmits the video in real-time to the user. The high resolution of the HD IR&TV system enables positive identifications of objects on the ground. The system will be able to operate under a regimental intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance command, and control system (C4ISR) or independently, as a stand-alone asset operated at the tactical level.

The selection of Thales for this contract strengthens the French group’s position in the unmanned systems sector, offering complete systems from micro-drones, mini and tactical drones, as well as on-board sensors, communication means, and ground control stations.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999984502792358}",neutral,0.9999984502792358,0
Thales to upgrade the Swiss Air Force Master radars - EDR Magazine,"Thu, 19 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmV1L3RoYWxlcy10by11cGdyYWRlLXRoZS1zd2lzcy1haXItZm9yY2UtbWFzdGVyLXJhZGFyc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As part of the FLORAKO programme modernisation, armasuisse has awarded Thales a contract to upgrade the Master radars for the Swiss Air Force. This contract, which amounts to 74 million euros, will be the main order within the broader FLORAKO radars life extension project approved by the Swiss government in 2016, is intended to extend the lifespan of the radars and to ensure operational excellence until 2030.

The modernisation of all fixed long-range surveillance radars will be carried out at the Thales site in Limours near Paris in cooperation with RUAG defence, who will act as a Thales subcontractor. This upgrade will take around 60 months until the last radar test can be completed, including a 24 month development phase leveraging the previous radar technologies. It will optimise the long-term performance support and ensure operational excellence for the full lifespan of the radars within the existing infrastructure. Engineering teams will develop a new radar signal and data processing and upgrade the antenna system, while, integration teams will carry out testing and qualification phases. The upgraded radars will be delivered to the Swiss Air Force one by one as soon as their performance has been successfully verified.

The Swiss Air Force has an air defence command and control system that has been fully operational since 2004. Designed by Thales in collaboration with other industrial partners, this system is one of the most complete and high performance air defence command and control systems currently in use in the world. FLORAKO is able to correlate civil and military data in real time, thus improving the quality of the global representation of airspace while reducing decision-making time.

With its unique expertise in air defence systems, airspace management and radar lifetime extension, Thales is able to meet the requirements expressed by the Swiss Air Force.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.5615590214729309}",positive,0.5615590214729309,1

Static electricity's tiny sparks - The Conversation Indonesia,"Thu, 05 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29udmVyc2F0aW9uLmNvbS9zdGF0aWMtZWxlY3RyaWNpdHlzLXRpbnktc3BhcmtzLTcwNjM30gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Static electricity is a ubiquitous part of everyday life. It’s all around us, sometimes funny and obvious, as when it makes your hair stand on end, sometimes hidden and useful, as when harnessed by the electronics in your cellphone. The dry winter months are high season for an annoying downside of static electricity – electric discharges like tiny lightning zaps whenever you touch door knobs or warm blankets fresh from the clothes dryer.

Static electricity is one of the oldest scientific phenomena people observed and described. Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus made the first account; in his sixth century B.C. writings, he noted that if amber was rubbed hard enough, small dust particles will start sticking to it. Three hundred years later, Theophrastus followed up on Thales’ experiments by rubbing various kinds of stone and also observed the “power of attraction.” But neither of these natural philosophers found a satisfactory explanation for what they saw.

It took almost 2,000 more years before the English word “electricity” was first coined, based on the Latin “electricus,” meaning “like amber.” Some of the most famous experiments were conducted by Benjamin Franklin in his quest to understand the underlying mechanism of electricity – which is one of the reasons why his face smiles from the US$100 bill. People quickly recognized electricity’s potential usefulness.

Of course, in the 18th century people mostly made use of static electricity in magic tricks and other performances. For instance, Stephen Gray’s “flying boy experiment” became a popular public demonstration: He’d use a Leyden jar to charge up the youth, suspended from silk cords, and then show how he could turn book pages via static electricity, or lift small objects just using the static attraction.

Building on Franklin’s insights – including his realization that electric charge comes in positive and negative flavors, and that total charge is always conserved – we nowadays understand at the atomic level what causes the electrostatic attraction, why it can cause mini lightning bolts and how to harness what can be a nuisance for use in various modern technologies.

What are these tiny sparks?

Static electricity comes down to the interactive force between electrical charges. At the atomic scale, negative charges are carried by tiny elementary particles called electrons. Most electrons are neatly packed inside the bulk of matter, whether it be a hard and lifeless stone or the soft, living tissue of your body. However, many electrons also sit right on the surface of any material. Each different material holds on to these surface electrons with its own different characteristic strength. If two materials rub against each other, electrons can be ripped out of the “weaker” material and find themselves on the material with stronger binding force.

This transfer of electrons – what we know as a spark of static electricity – happens all the time. Infamous examples are children sliding down a playground slide, feet shuffling along a carpet or someone removing wool gloves in order to shake hands.

But we notice its effect more frequently in the dry months of winter, when the air has very low humidity. Dry air is an electrical insulator, whereas moist air acts as a conductor. This is what happens: In dry air, electrons get trapped on the surface with the stronger binding force. Unlike when the air is moist, they can’t find their way to flow back to the surface where they came from, and they can’t make the distribution of charges uniform again.

A static electric spark occurs when an object with a surplus of negative electrons comes close to another object with less negative charge – and the surplus of electrons is large enough to make the electrons “jump.” The electrons flow from where they’ve built up – like on you after walking across a wool rug – to the next thing you contact that doesn’t have an excess of electrons – such as a doorknob.

When electrons have nowhere to go, the charge builds up on surfaces – until it reaches a critical maximum and discharges in the form of a tiny lightning bolt. Give the electrons a place to go – such as your outstretched finger – and you will most certainly feel the zap.

The power of the mini sparks

Though sometimes annoying, the amount of charge in static electricity is typically quite little and rather innocent. The voltage can be about 100 times the voltage of typical power outlets. However, these huge voltages are nothing to worry about, since voltage is just a measure of the charge difference between objects. The “dangerous” quantity is current, which tells how many electrons are flowing. Since typically only a few electrons are transmitted in a static electric discharge, these zaps are pretty harmless.

Nevertheless, these little sparks can be fatal to sensitive electronics, such as the hardware components of a computer. Small currents carried by only few electrons can be enough to accidentally fry them. That’s why workers in electronic industries have to remain “grounded.” Being grounded just means maintaining a wired connection to the ground, which for the electrons looks like an empty highway “home.” Grounding yourself is easily done by touching a metal component or holding a key in your hand. Metals are very good conductors, and so electrons are quite happy to go there.

A more serious threat is an electric discharge in the vicinity of flammable gases. This is why it’s advisable to ground yourself before touching the pumps at gas stations; you don’t want a stray spark to combust any stray gasoline fumes. Or you can invest in the kind of anti-static wristband widely used by workers in the electronic industries to safely ground individuals before they work on very sensitive electronic components. They prevent static buildups using a conductive ribbon that coils around your wrist.

In everyday life, the best method to reduce charge buildups is running a humidifier to raise the amount of moisture in the air. Also keeping your skin moist by applying moisturizer can make a big difference. Dryer sheets prevent charges from building up as your clothes tumble dry by spreading a small amount of fabric softener over the cloth. These positive particles balance out loose electrons, and the effective charge nullifies, meaning your clothes won’t emerge from the dryer clingy and stuck to one another. You can rub fabric softener on your carpets to prevent charge buildup too. Last but not least, wearing cotton clothes and leather-soled shoes are the better choice, rather than wool clothing and rubber-soled shoes, if you’ve really had it with static electricity.

Harnessing static electricity

Despite the nuisance and possible dangers of static electricity, it definitely has its benefits.

Many everyday applications of modern technology crucially rely on static electricity. For instance, Xerox machines and photocopiers use electric attraction to “glue” charged tone particles onto paper. Air fresheners not only make the room smell nice, but they really do eliminate bad odors by discharging static electricity onto dust particles, thus dissembling the bad smell.

Similarly, the smokestacks found in modern factories use charged plates to reduce pollution. As smoke particles move up the stack, they pick up negative charges from a metal grid. Once charged, they are attracted to plates on the other sides of the smokestack that are positively charged. Finally, the charged smoke particles are collected onto a tray from the collecting plates and can be disposed of.

Static electricity has also found its way into nanotechnology, where it is used, for instance, to pick up single atoms by laser beams. These atoms can then be manipulated for all kinds of purposes as in various computing applications. Another exciting application in nanotechnology is the control of nanoballoons, which through static electricity can be switched between an inflated and a collapsed state. These molecular machines could one day deliver medication to specific tissues within the body.

Static electricity has seen two and a half millennia since its discovery. Still it’s a curiosity, a nuisance – but it’s also proven to be important for our everyday lives.

Image courtesy of Aviation Design. The mini UAV is launched using a lightweight ramp. Image courtesy of Aviation Design. The Spy’Ranger UAV has a speed of 90km/h. Image courtesy of Aviation Design.

Spy’Ranger mini unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system is developed by Thales for use by the armed forces and special forces units in applications such as airborne image intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), and target acquisition.

The UAV has the ability to operate in battlefields and hostile environments at long ranges both during the day and at night.

The French Defence Procurement Agency selected Spy’Ranger mini surveillance and reconnaissance UAV for the mission requirements of the French Armed Forces in January. A total of 210 UAVs are expected to be delivered to the French Armed Forces beginning 2018.

Spy’Ranger mini UAV design and features

Each Spy’Ranger tactical unmanned aerial system consists of three mini aerial vehicles, a ground control station and associated technical equipment. It is carried in a tactical backpack.

The UAV features a fixed-wing design with lightweight, compact airframe built by French-based Aviation Design using all-composite high epoxy carbon materials. It has a wingspan of 3.9m, while its maximum take-off weight and payload capacities are 14kg and 1.2kg respectively.

It has the ability to perform repeated take-off and landings in confined areas and difficult terrain conditions. A lightweight ramp of carbon fibre sandwich construction is used for launching the UAV. A replaceable foam skid is fitted to ensure safe landing of the drone.

The UAV can be optionally provided with near-infrared laser illuminator, hand-over capability, and 3D-simulating system.

Payloads aboard Spy’Ranger UAV

The Spy’Ranger mini UAV comes with a customised multi-sensor optronic gimbal payload pod, manufactured by French UAV payload systems developer Merio, to assist in ISR missions.

Featuring three-axis electronic stabilisation, the nose-mounted payload system incorporates two gimbals with high-definition electro-optical / infrared (EO / IR) sensors gyrostabilised in two axes to capture imagery and video in day / night lighting conditions.

The onboard sensors provide automatic target detection of stationary and moving objects, video tracking and geotracking functions.

Command and control

The UAV can operate in pilot-assisted and fully automated modes. In the pilot-assisted mode, the drone is controlled by a single operator using a geographical information system from the ground control station.

""The UAV has the ability to operate in battlefields and hostile environments at long ranges both during the day and at night.""

The UAV executes missions autonomously from take-off to landing in the fully automated mode.

It is fitted with a high-speed encrypted tactical data link for secure transmission of high-definition imagery and video acquired by the onboard sensors to the ground control station in real time to a distance of up to 30km.

Ground segment

The ground control station provides the operator with the ability to operate and control multiple UAVs. It is interoperable with a man-portable multifunction camera and ground surveillance radar.

It consists of a ruggedised laptop computer, which stores sensor data and displays the UAV’s flight information in 3D maps in real time. The ground control station can interconnect to a C4I (command, control, computers, communications and intelligence) system.

Announced on 16 January and also covering demonstration activities, the deal will deliver an updated organic airborne early warning capability for use from the RN’s future pair of Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers.

The RN’s entire 30-strong fleet of Merlin HM2s will be modified by Leonardo Helicopters to enable them to carry an evolution of the Thales-developed Searchwater radar and Cerberus mission system: a combination in current service with its aged Westland Sea King ASaC 7 rotorcraft. Thales will supply 10 such systems, which it says will “maximise the re-use of the Ministry of Defence’s existing investment in equipment, training and expertise”.

Leonardo Helicopters

New elements to be introduced with the Crowsnest update include an inverse synthetic aperture radar mode, electronic support measures equipment and what Thales describes as an “autonomous artificial intelligence-based tracking system”. Once combined with touch-screen displays for the Merlin’s onboard operators, these will provide “vastly improved target identification [and] the ability to library-match airborne contacts,” the company adds.

Introduction of the Crowsnest capability will occur in sequence with the RN’s retirement of the Sea King ASaC 7 fleet from 2018. Thales says the Merlin-based system – to be home-based at RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall – is expected to remain in operational use until 2029.

The Searchwater/Cerberus upgrade option was selected in March 2015, with a Lockheed Martin UK-led assessment phase having concluded last year. The MoD says its contract award also includes an initial £9 million to provide spare parts for use during the programme’s training and operational deployment phases.

"AUSS, a disruptive concept by Thales & partners - Mer et Marine","Mon, 23 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lcmV0bWFyaW5lLmNvbS9mci9kZWZlbnNlL2F1c3MtYS1kaXNydXB0aXZlLWNvbmNlcHQtYnktdGhhbGVzLXBhcnRuZXJz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales has teamed up with 19 high-tech startups to develop the AUSS autonomous underwater and surface system, a concept that is set to reshape autonomous operations at sea.

Surveillance, intelligence, counter-terrorism, mine countermeasures, anti-submarine warfare, monitoring of offshore infrastructure, and shipwreck search & recovery are among the applications envisaged for the new concept now being developed by Thales’s underwater systems business and 19 French small and medium-size enterprises. A potential game-changer, this hybrid autonomous underwater system will be equipped not only for underwater missions, but also for surface intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, or ISR. For over three years, Thales and its partners have been quietly developing the basic concept and its underlying innovations.

More capable than an AUV

The proposal to call the concept an ‘autonomous underwater and surface system’ is partly due to the difficulty the team had in describing it in just a few words. AUSS aims to overcome the shortcomings of current-generation AUVs. “Over the last decade or so we’ve done a lot of work on AUVs for mine countermeasures. This time, we wanted to develop a more capable autonomous system for a broader range of missions,” says Jean-François Ghignoni, Director of Marketing & Strategy, Thales Underwater Systems. “Today’s AUVs suffer from several limitations. First, they cannot stop. Second, they can only avoid obstacles by manoeuvring while maintaining speed. More generally, attitude control is ensured by maintaining relative motion between the control surfaces and the surrounding water. In other words, whether under water or close to the surface, they are not very agile. Note too that the only current-generation AUVs capable of raising a sensor mast weigh 5 tonnes or more.”

ISR, the main game

The AUSS concept was initially developed to meet a range of ISR needs. While AUVs have proven their worth for MCM, they are ill-suited to surface ISR. First, their behaviour when floating or close to the surface is difficult to model; second, their stability depends on the sea state. There is, however, growing demand for ISR drones that can be launched from the shore, from surface vessels, or, in future, from submarines. Standoff ISR drones will significantly improve a submarine’s tactical situation awareness and surveillance capabilities without compromising its discretion; in other words, without exposing the boat or its crew to unnecessary risk.

Light, stable and agile

Considerations such as these suggested that the platform should be relatively light — say 500 to 1000kg, depending on the payload — as well as stable, agile, and able to manoeuvre in confined spaces. It should feature a deployable mast carrying a range of sensors including a radar, electro-optical devices, Sigint interceptors and antennas for radio and/or satellite communications. It should also be stable in moderate seas and offer good endurance along with the ability to evade threats. “The aim then was to design a platform combining all these features yet weighing less than a tonne. It would also have to be able to remain stationary, or on station, in the presence of strong currents, move or remain on station close to the surface, and, while stationary, deploy a 3-metre mast,” says Jean-François Ghignoni. While AUVs continue to improve, all are based on the same operating principles with the same inherent limitations. Thales saw a need and an opportunity to aim for a disruptive technology.

A mandate to think outside the box

To address the challenge, Thales and its partners decided to go back to basics and explore alternative approaches. “To promote innovation, we began by giving the team an explicit mandate to think outside the box, to get off the beaten track and to come up with new solutions meeting our needs. It was an exhilarating experience. The SMEs came up with a host of innovative ideas resulting in the AUSS concept; a clever combination of an AUV and an unmanned surface vehicle, or USV.

Five sea trial campaigns completed

Design work began in 2013 and the first series of sea trials was conducted the following year off Brest. Since then, four more campaigns have been conducted to validate the basic concept and evaluate the platform’s performance for different mission profiles.

The importance of industrial design

The prototype AUSS is 5.5 metres long, 53cm in diameter and weighs around 600 kilos. Initially it looked like a torpedo. The current version looks somewhat different, firstly because the team wanted to ensure that it was clearly distinguishable from a conventional AUV. In fact, Thales asked an industrial designer to give the AUSS a different look. The engineering teams saw this essentially as a marketing ploy, until, contrary to all expectations, they realised that the new design would have a significant operational benefits. “When we called in Concept Frenoy Design, we initially asked them to make the AUSS more visually appealing than a simple tube. The industrial design team submitted a number of proposals. On examining them, the project’s scientific director was surprised to see that some of the proposed shapes offered better performance than the simple tube!

Like an underwater helicopter

Hydrodynamically efficient thanks to the absence of control surfaces, the platform is powered by contrarotating propellers and surprisingly agile. “The AUSS advances discreetly to its designated area of operation with its obstacle avoidance system activated. Should it encounter an obstacle, the combined propulsion and manoeuvring system enables it to stop, then ascend or descend vertically rather than having to manoeuvre while maintaining speed like an AUV. To put it in a nutshell, an AUSS drone behaves like a helicopter whereas AUVs behave like a fixed-wing aircraft. The AUSS can, for instance, come to a complete stop in about 10 metres.”

Standing tall, mast up

Another innovation is the centre-of-gravity control system, a closely guarded Thales secret that enables the AUSS to adopt any attitude in a limited volume of water. “The concept was first validated in the Thales 20mx8m test tank at Brest, then at sea by making the platform move through 360° while remaining within a cubic volume just 8m on a side.” Thanks to this new approach to mass and centre-of-gravity control, the AUSS can remain upright and on station. This breakthrough is the result of many tests exploring a number of ideas. “To achieve this paradigm shift, we had to think way outside the box,” says Jean-François Ghignoni. “For ISR missions, the platform needs to stand upright with its nose close to the surface and its sensor mast protruding. Keeping the hull below the surface improves stability by limiting the impact of wave action.” If an AUSS drone on an operational ISR mission deploys its panoramic sensors and identifies a threat or intrusion likely to betray its presence, it retracts its mast and retreats to deeper water. Then, when the danger has passed, it automatically resumes its mission where it left off.

Two weeks at sea

On completing an operational ISR phase, the drone rotates to a horizontal attitude and proceeds with its mission profile. One option is to have it sink to the seafloor, deploy an anchor, then wait for a given time or event in a low-energy state. Several innovative technologies contribute to the drone’s optimal operational potential and low power consumption. “To give just one example, efficient mass control means efficient buoyancy control, which in turn ensures that the drone consumes very little power while stationary.” The end result is significantly improved endurance. The Thales designers aim to achieve two weeks’ endurance, a range of 50nm and a maximum speed of 20 knots. The prototype already achieved 17 knots during sea trials. “The high dash speed will enable the AUSS to escape threats, deploy rapidly and trail fast targets,” says Jean-François Ghignoni.

Excellent results

Thales chose not to publish the videos recorded during the five test campaigns conducted off Brest in 2016. Journalists who were allowed to see the footage confirm that the prototype’s behaviour corresponds broadly to that shown in the demonstration video. The platform’s agility is impressive, as it can rotate to the vertical, deploy its mast and record imagery with surprising stability up to sea state 3 without a sensor stabilisation system.

These capabilities are precisely those required for ISR missions where discretion and endurance are vital. This is not, however, the only area in which the AUSS concept is expected to excel. “The aim, from the outset, was to design a multimission platform. Now that the basic concept has been validated, we plan to talk to clients about tailoring it to their operational needs.”

Counter-terrorism

AUSS drones are expected to prove particularly useful in maritime counter-terrorism. An AUSS drone could, for instance, surveil a hijacked vessel or facility from relatively close range using a variety of sensors (TV/IR camera, eavesdropping systems, etc.) enabling the authorities to monitor the situation in real time. The drone could also, presumably, be equipped with jammers to cut off communications between the hijackers and the outside world and to incapacitate the vessel’s radar, thereby giving a commando team an opportunity to board and take control.

Mine countermeasures

Although the AUSS drone was not designed primarily for mine countermeasures, it nevertheless looks very promising for MCM missions. First, the hull can accommodate Thales’s Samdis side-scan sonar; a type already used by dedicated MCM AUVs. The nose section can also be equipped with various payloads, including a camera and projector for mine identification. The AUSS drone’s agility is an important advantage as it can manoeuvre to record images of an object of interest from various angles. “We believe that the AUSS drone could be readily repurposed for MCM to offer higher performance than existing MCM AUVs, particularly as regards its stability and ability to operate in the presence of strong currents,” says Jean-François Ghignoni.

Surveillance of offshore infrastructure

Turning to the civil sector, one application that has attracted attention is in offshore oil & gas where AUSS drones could be used to monitor seabed equipment. “This work is currently performed by vessels equipped with remotely operated vehicles. These vessels and their ROVs are, however, both costly and labour intensive. An AUSS drone could leave a port under its own power, transit to an offshore oil or gas field, then autonomously monitor kilometres of seabed piping and associated equipment while periodically transmitting imagery via, say, a satellite link to a shore-based control centre. This would significantly reduce the cost of monitoring seabed infrastructure.”

A concept with enormous potential

Given its modular design and adaptability to a wide range of operating constraints and needs, the potential applications for AUSS drones are enormous. “Operational personnel who have seen our presentations have been amazed by the drone’s capabilities and consider that the concept has great potential,” says Jean-François Ghignoni. “While we have already validated the feasibility of some applications, many others have still to be explored. For the moment, we have only made public a small proportion of what AUSS drones will be capable of. We are still a long way from measuring the full impact of their unprecedented agility and performance.”

Sonar barrage

One of the many disruptions to established operational procedures could be in anti-submarine warfare. With the number of submarines in operation rising rapidly and many countries lacking the means to detect their presence, suitably equipped AUSS drones could be deployed as sonar stations with capabilities similar to those of large sonobuoys, or, alternatively, in groups to form mobile or even permanent acoustic barrages protecting harbours, maritime approaches and other sensitive areas.

Discussions under way

After years spent improving existing concepts for autonomous underwater systems, the AUSS is expected to prove truly disruptive on both the technological and operational fronts. Time will tell. For the moment, all Thales will say is that the concept is attracting enormous interest and that discussions are in progress with various navies impressed by its potential.

Towards a new cluster

After spending millions of euros on company-funded R&D on this project, Thales now aims to establish itself as a world leader in the field. “The operational prospects are huge and we have what it takes to offer better solutions than our competitors,” says Jean-François Ghignoni, who hopes to see a new field of French excellence emerge. “We hope that the SMEs that helped us to develop the concept thus far will start exporting and indeed that the project acts as a pole for French companies active in AUVs in general. We are already talking to our partners about setting up a new export-focussed AUSS cluster.”

Asked whether Thales could end up competing head on with established French leaders, Jean-François Ghignoni replied: “We do not aim to compete with French companies producing MCM AUVs. The AUSS concept is a truly multimission one. Navies that choose to acquire AUSS drones are unlikely to do so primarily to conduct MCM missions for which AUVs already offer satisfactory performance. The first applications will be for ISR, counter-terrorism or the surveillance of offshore infrastructure.” Even so, some clients clearly may be tempted to reduce overall acquisition, maintenance and training costs by using AUSS drones in multiple roles.

KeolisAmey to operate Manchester Metrolink - International Railway Journal,"Wed, 18 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWxqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9wYXNzZW5nZXIvbGlnaHQtcmFpbC9rZW9saXNhbWV5LXRvLW9wZXJhdGUtbWFuY2hlc3Rlci1tZXRyb2xpbmsv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"KeolisAmey was one of four groups shortlisted by TfGM in October 2015 to bid for the contract, the other three being National Express, Transdev and existing operator RATP Dev. KeolisAmey will take over from RATP Dev and maintainer MPact-Thales when their contracts end in July.

Metrolink is operated by a fleet of 120 modern LRVs supplied by Bombardier and equipped with Wi-Fi. Under the new contract, 300 new jobs, including drivers, customer service representatives, apprentices, and trainees, will be created with a commitment to improve staff training and skills. This will enable an increased staff presence on the network to improve customer service and security. There is also a commitment to improve reliability and communication with passengers.

Metrolink has tripled in size in recent years through a £1.5bn expansion programme, making it the largest light rail network in Britain, and is set to expand further. Manchester’s second line through the city centre will be completed this year, and a £350m 5.5km extension to Trafford Park will open in 2020-21.

KeolisAmey currently operates the Docklands Light Rail automated light metro network in eastern London.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9396677017211914}",positive,0.9396677017211914,1
Top 40 tops $10 billion - Australian Defence Magazine,"Tue, 17 Jan 2017 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5kZWZlbmNlLmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzL3RvcC00MC10b3BzLTEwLWJpbGxpb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Judy Hinz | Brisbane

The result of this year's Top 40 survey reveal a strong upward trend in Defence business. For the first time in the survey's 21-year history, total turnover has exceeded $10 billion.

The total revenue of the Top 40 Defence Contractors reached an impressive $10.384 billion in 2016, up 11 per cent on the 2015 total of $9.241 billion.

BAE Systems Australia topped the survey once again with a turnover of $1.2 billion followed closely by Raytheon Australia with $964 million, a company record.

Thales Australia retained third position with $924 million, up $85 million on the previous year.

Boeing Australia was among the standouts, achieving fourth ranking with an $850 miilion turnover representing an increase of 88 per cent on 2015.

The leader of the base support and infrastructure contractors was Broadspectrum, in the no.7 ranking with an improved turnover of $506 million.

The Top 10 Defence Contractors for 2016 were:

BAE Systems Australia Raytheon Australia Thales Australia Boeing Defence Australia (BDA) ASC Airbus Group Australia Pacific Broadspectrum Lockheed MArtin Australia Lendlease Building Spotless Group

Lockheed Martin at no.8 has demonstrated its success in ringing local suppliers into the F-35 program – there are currently 17 under contract with approximately US$443 million of work assigned and additional opportunities for work over the next 30 years.

Indeed, the involvement of overseas primes in the local defence industry is often more complex than their local revenue figure reveals.

For SMEs in 2016 the total turnover of the Top 20 topped $800 million for the first time, up from $642.7 million in 2015. Seven of them are Australian owned and there were five ranked this year that did not appear in last year's listing:

Supacat

St Hilliers Property

Waterway Constructions

Norship Marine

Nioa

Last year the turnover of the company ranked at 20th was $15 million; this year Nioa was in that position with $25.7 million.

Overall there has been an increase in employment, with more than 15 companies reporting increased employees, adding more than 1,300 jobs to the Australian economy.

The results of the survey demonstrate the value of the defence industry to the economy and the range of sophisticated capabilities that have been developed locally in the past 20 years.

The recent changes in the Commonwealth's defence industry policy, and the ambitions laid out in the 2016 Defence Industry Policy Statement, are pivotal indicators of what's important to Defence for industry as a Fundamental Input to Capability.

Next year the survey methodology shall change to include a broader range of factors taken into account besides revenues, including:

Australian Industry Content

Investment in local R&D

Investment and relationships with the local SME supply chain

Contribution to local industry's global competitiveness and exports
