TopDeck is an integrated modular avionics suite in a glass cockpit derived from the latest technology.

""The key to enhancing safety is to optimize the crew's cognitive workload, particularly during complex tasks,"" said Yves Joannic, VP Helicopter Avionics activities of Thales Group. ""TopDeck allows a pilot flying the S-76D helicopter to directly control cockpit tasks on his displays using an intuitive Cursor Control Device (iCCD). This iCCD – the first of its kind on a helicopter – puts all the functions at the pilot's fingertips, thus reducing workload, shortening reaction time and increasing safety.""

The increased reliability and safety delivered in the Thales cockpit on the S-76D helicopter builds upon the well established safety and reliability record of the S-76 helicopter series. Several variations of the TopDeck avionics are currently flying onboard the AgustaWestland A109, Boeing's Chinook, and the ATR72 from the ATR consortium.

In addition to the advanced Thales integrated avionics system and autopilot, the S-76D helicopter's features include all-composite, flaw-tolerant main rotor blades; an industry leading external acoustic signature, health and usage monitoring system, active vibration control; powerful Pratt & Whitney Canada PW210S engines as standard equipment; and an optional Rotor Ice Protection System (RIPS) for all-weather capability.

""Throughout our test flight program, the S-76D helicopter prototypes have performed exceptionally well, with a smoothness and ease of flight that our customers have consistently expressed great excitement over,"" said Dan Hunter, Sikorsky Global Helicopter's Director of Programs. ""Our partnership with Thales on this element of the aircraft's development has been very successful in leveraging the inherent scalability of the TopDeck suite and further enhancing its functional content. As with all of our products, we expect to continue to add functionality as missions expand and the marketplace demands new capabilities.""

Over the last several months, Sikorsky has offered customers an opportunity to fly the prototype S-76D aircraft. Greg Barnes, S-76D Chief Program Pilot, said those who have flown it cited the aircraft's power and performance, but also marveled at the automatic flight control system and interactivity. ""The S-76D will offer a multitude of new capabilities in an intuitive, interactive cockpit that is very user friendly. In essence, it is a comprehensive cockpit that is not complex to operate. These features will be especially valuable to operators flying in demanding offshore oil or emergency medical missions.""

Delivery of the first aircraft to the launch customer is slated for 2012.

The new generation S-76D helicopter will perform an array of civil missions including executive transport, offshore oil, emergency medical services, and a multi-mission role.

"Australia Selects Hawkei for its Future Protected, Light Tactical Vehicle - Defense Update","Wed, 14 Dec 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5zZS11cGRhdGUuY29tLzIwMTExMjE0X2hhd2tlaV9zZWxlY3RlZC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Australian Defence has selected Hawkei light tactical vehicle design from Thales Australia as the preferred design for LAND 121 Phase 4. Subject to successful testing of the vehicles, final Government approval of the project is expected in 2015, and production work could potentially commence in Australia as early as 2016. Part of Project Overlander, the acquisition of 1,300 modern, protected light tactical vehicles represent a $1.5 billion part of the $7.5 billion project. The selection of an indigenous Australian design derails previous plans to join the U.S. Joint Light Tactical Vehicle program, which Australia has been part of in recent years. ‘Defence will continue to monitor progress of the US JLTV program’ the announcement said, but no additional funding commitments have been made at this stage.





Australia evaluated two candidates for this program – the Hawkei and Ocelot, provided by Force Protection International. The Government required the vehicle to be manufactured in Australia, and both contenders have relied on local subsidiaries and subcontractors to fulfill this requirement.

The next stage in the program will include funding for further development and testing of the Hawkei, including the manufacture of prototype vehicles. Thales designed this vehicle specifically to meet Australian specification; the Israeli armor protection expert Plasan has joined as a team member, to provide the protection suite for the vehicle.

Thales Australia is currently manufacturing the Bushmaster Protected Mobility Vehicles at its factory in Bendigo. This manufacturing capability, and the skills of the workforce, is an important national security capability. On current plans, manufacture of Bushmasters at Bendigois expected to be completed before the end of 2013, in time to begin serial production of the new vehicle.

In order to retain critical skills in Bendigo while the design of the Hawkei is finalized and proven, the production of additional Bushmaster vehicles is being considered. “It is very important that we keep that industrial technical development capacity in Bendigo, and as the materials indicate we’ll be in discussions with Thales so far as additional Bushmasters are concerned to ensure that we retain that industrial capacity linked to the development of the Hawkei.” said Minister for Defense & Defense Material, Stephen Smith."
Thales delivers Automatic Train Operation system for the Mecca metro in time for the Hajj pilgrimage - defenceWeb,"Mon, 12 Dec 2011 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWZlbmNld2ViLmNvLnphL2pvaW50L3NjaWVuY2UtYS1kZWZlbmNlLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kvdGhhbGVzLWRlbGl2ZXJzLWF1dG9tYXRpYy10cmFpbi1vcGVyYXRpb24tc3lzdGVtLWZvci10aGUtbWVjY2EtbWV0cm8taW4tdGltZS1mb3ItdGhlLWhhamotcGlsZ3JpbWFnZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales has opened the last phase of Mecca’s new 18.5 km metro line on schedule and in time for the Hajj pilgrimage, the world’s largest religious gathering. Thus, the line transports pilgrims between holy sites, reducing travel time between Arafat and Muzdalifah from five hours to just ten minutes.

The ATO solution is the last successful stage in this ambitious project, improving metro performance by allowing “hands off” operation by drivers. The solution ensures that trains comply with required track speeds and operating conditions to ensure efficient, safe travel at

all times.

Thales has provided a complete solution for the Mecca metro project, including signalling solutions based on its world-leading SelTrac Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) system, fully integrated communications, an Operation Control Centre (OCC) to supervise

the line and an automated passenger information system.

The metro serves three main areas (Arafat, Mina and Muzdalifah), each of which have three stations. The complete journey time along the 18.5 km line is now less than 30 minutes. Thanks to the Thales transportation system, the new metro will have the capacity to carry 72,000 passengers per hour.

“After managing the security supervision of the holy sites, Thales is very proud to have contributed once again to the improvement of the pilgrimage with this automatic metro,” said Michelangelo Neri, VP for Thales’s civil business in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. “The new transportation system developed for the Mecca metro combines all the latest signalling and communications technologies.”

This success consolidates Thales’s presence in the Middle East transportation market, where its credentials include solutions for the metro in Dubai and the North South Railway in

Saudi Arabia.

Notes to editors

Thales’s SelTrac CBTC system improves line capacity while enhancing safety and has become a

benchmark in the metro market. Already deployed in 30 major cities worldwide, SelTrac ensures the safety of millions of passengers every day.

Thales Australia CEO, Chris Jenkins welcomed the announcement by the Minister for Defence, Stephen Smith, that Hawkei had been down-selected under the LAND 121 Phase 4 program.

“This is a fantastic achievement for our engineering and production team, our partners and the 120 Australian firms that are part of our manufacturing supply chain,” he said.

“Up against the best vehicles in its class from US and European manufacturers, the Thales Hawkei has come out on top, which is a great vote of confidence in the skills of Australian defence industry.

“Subject to further discussions with the Commonwealth, the development contract announced today will enable us to take the prototype through to a production-ready vehicle that fully meets the specifications set by the Australian Army.

“It is a truly innovative, highly mobile, highly protected, 7-tonne vehicle, with in-built vehicle systems to make it a real fighting platform for Australian troops.

“The Hawkei has been developed with Vehicle Electronic Architecture to be mission system ready.

“We will work closely with Defence through the further development of the Hawkei to ensure it meets their needs. Our international and local partners including Plasan, Boeing, PAC Group and many Australian SMEs will be vital to this project.

“Today’s decision also makes it possible for Thales to pursue export opportunities for the Hawkei.

“We have already achieved more than $100m in Bushmaster export sales, and the new Hawkei vehicle has great export potential, with a design that meets the needs of a wide range of military forces.”

Mr Jenkins also welcomed the Minister for Defence’s commitment to the Bendigo protected vehicle manufacturing capability and the skills of its workforce as “an important national security capability”."

MAN will provide medium and heavy armored and unarmored trucks while Thales will deliver the Hawkei light tactical vehicle, in protected and unprotected configurations. The two programs are part of an investment of A$7.5 billion, providing the Australian Defence Force with around 7,500 new vehicles over the next decade. Under Project Overlander, the Australian Defence will replace the current fleet of Land Rovers, Unimog, Mack and S-Liner trucks and their associated trailers and modules that have been in service since the early 1980s. Although commercial negotiations are expected to conclude only in two years, the program is expected to exceed the budget estimate set in 2007.



Rheinmetall MAN Military Vehicles Australia has been down-selected as the preferred tenderer to SUPPLY 2,700 protected and unprotected medium and heavy vehicles under LAND 121 Phase 3B. Under Phase 5B the Australian Defence will have options to by additional 1,000 unprotected vehicles to be used for training missions. The Australian announcement stated that Rheinmetall MAN was selected as it offered the best value for money and met Defence requirements for capability and cost. It is anticipated that approximately 35 per cent of the value of the Phase 3B work will be undertaken in Australia by the prime contractor in Wacol, Brisbane and Australian subcontractors, including the installation of locally supplied bodies and modules, and integration of vehicle parts and testing. The new trucks will replace the Australian Defence Force’s current fleet of Unimog, Mack and S-Liner trucks, including medium and heavy recovery vehicles, medium and heavy tractors (equipment transporters); heavy integrated load handling vehicles quipped with self-loading hooks or lift trucks and medium-weight tray variants fitted with cranes and tippers. In addition, 2,500 new trailers will be procured from the Australian trailer maker Haulmark Trailers."
