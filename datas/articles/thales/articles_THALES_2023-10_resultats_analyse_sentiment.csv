Hitachi Secures Final Approval for $1.8B Thales Acquisition - RailwayAge Magazine,"Mon, 30 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWx3YXlhZ2UuY29tL2NzL2hpdGFjaGktc2VjdXJlcy1maW5hbC1hcHByb3ZhbC1mb3ItMS04Yi10aGFsZXMtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hitachi Secures Final Approval for $1.8B Thales Acquisition Written by David Burroughs , News & Features Writer, International Railway Journal









Hitachi Rail will divest its mainline signaling businesses in France, Germany and Britain.

Hitachi Rail has been given clearance to proceed with its $1.8 billion (€1.66 billion) acquisition of Thales’ Ground Transportation Systems (GTS) business, after receiving conditional approval from the European Commission (EC) on Oct. 30.

The EC’s approval means that the deal has now received clearance from all 13 competition authorities that reviewed the acquisition. As a condition of securing approval for the acquisition in Britain and the European Union (EU), Hitachi Rail has agreed to divest its mainline signaling businesses in France, Germany and Britain.

The EC says its investigation showed that the transaction would have reduced competition and led to higher prices and less innovation in the markets for mainline signaling projects, including overlay and resignaling projects in both Germany and France, as well as interlocking projects in France.

To address the commission’s concerns, Hitachi Rail offered to divest its mainline signaling platforms in both countries, including international locations, which fully addressed the EC’s concerns. This will also preserve competition by removing the horizontal overlap between the parties in the French and German markets for interlockings and automatic train protection (ATO) wayside systems for mainline signaling.

The EC says the commitments made by Hitachi will enable the purchasers of the divested businesses to run them as a viable competitive force in the market on a lasting basis. The commission will closely monitor the divestment process, including approving the purchasers of the divested businesses.

Following positive feedback from market testing, the commission concluded that the modified transaction would no longer raise competition concerns.

Hitachi Rail has also committed to divest its mainline signaling business in Britain following concerns raised by Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The CMA then gave its approval for the deal Oct. 4.

Hitachi announced the acquisition of Thales GTS in August 2021. The transaction was first notified to the commission on Oct. 4, 2022, but the parties withdrew their notification Nov. 3, 2022, in view of the competition concerns identified by the EC. The parties renotified the transaction to the commission on Sept. 14, 2023.

Hitachi previously strengthened its mainline and urban rail signaling capabilities with the acquisition of Italy’s Ansaldo STS, which was completed in January 2019.

The Danish Ministry of Defence Acquisition and Logistics Organisation (DALO) signs an agreement with the Netherlands Defence procurement agency COMMIT (Commando Materieel en IT) for the acquisition of five Thales Ground Master 200 Multi-Mission Compact radars

Providing enhanced situational awareness, operational superiority, fire support and weapon location capabilities, the radar will support the Danish Air Force in air surveillance and air defence missions.

As a recognized European leader in systems-of-systems integration, Thales draws on its air surveillance and air defence expertise to help nations guarantee their sovereignty.



Radar Ground Master 200 Multi Mission Compact © Thales

Building on the strong international NATO cooperation, as well as strategic bi-lateral defence ties between Denmark and the Netherlands, DALO signed an agreement with COMMIT for the acquisition of five Thales Ground Master 200 Multi-Mission Compact radars (GM200 MM/C).

Forces face both traditional threats and new threats such as drone warfare. Fast and early detection is key to staying one-step ahead and protecting valuable assets. Today, modern Autonomous Unmanned Vehicles (UAVs) can defy detection by traditional radar systems and adversaries can exploit the low speed and coordinated attack capabilities of these aircraft to saturate the airspace in a conflict.

Designed for modern warfare, with operational excellence and military doctrine in mind, the GM200 MM/C from the Ground Master 200 family, provides simultaneous accurate detection, tracking and classification against all current and future threats, including drones. ​ It offers radar operators with more time-on-target to gather as much information on incoming threats as possible thanks to new-generation 4D AESA technology*. The system automatically detects tracks, classifies aircraft, missiles, helicopters, multiple UAVs and RAM (Rockets, Artillery and Mortar), and is particularly suited to air surveillance, air defence and weapon locating.

In addition, the compact design of the GM200 MM/C provides ease of choice from fixed location mode to high mobility, very short deployment times and ease of transportation on any platform. It also benefits from the latest software defined radar technology, enabling future upgrades and capabilities expansion to manage the ever-evolving spectrum of changing threats and doctrines.

Thales has a long-standing expertise in every aspect of air surveillance and air defence, from drone countermeasures to ballistic missile defence: surface radars, airborne radars, command centres, communication systems and equipment, and different types of effectors.

“I am very happy that we are now acquiring new, mobile radars for airspace surveillance. This is an advanced capability that the Armed Forces badly need, not least in light of the current serious political security situation, says Lieutenant General, Kim Jesper Jørgensen, chief of the Danish Ministry of Defence Acquisition and Logistics Organisation (DALO).

“Cooperation is important, especially among the smaller countries in Europe. The acquisition of the GM200 MM/C is an example of how allies can help each other in strengthening their defence forces by interoperable materiel. In addition, it is an advantage that both Denmark and the Netherlands have identical configurations of the GM200 MM/C, which enables cooperation for identical future updates and support, says Vice admiral Jan Willem Hartman, Commander at COMMIT.

“This Government-to-Government contract will provide the Danish Air Force and the Dutch Armed Forces with a common radar platform for future collaboration. Thales contributes to the safety and security of military personnel and high value assets in European NATO countries and is proud to support nations in their mission for air sovereignty, says Gerben Edelijn, CEO Thales Netherlands.

The agreement supports an ongoing program seeking more than 40 light fighter planes to replace Poland’s Soviet-era MiG-29 fleet.

South Korea and the Polish government signed the foreign military sale in September 2022, valued at $13.7 billion.

Scorpion Helmets

For the KAI contract, Thales will supply its proprietary Scorpion Helmet Mounted Displays, which offer easy access to the aircraft’s mission systems, navigation, and sensors.

The technology is a digital platform with zero-perceived latency, full-color symbology, and a single display module.

It uses a hybrid, optically-based inertial technology to augment the pilot’s vision with the aircraft’s tracking capabilities, providing situational awareness on day and night deployments.

Thales stated that the Scorpion helmets can also be employed with T-50 Golden Eagle Advanced Jet Trainers and its TA-50 Lead-in Fighter Trainer variant.

“We are excited to add the FA-50 to the long list of highly capable combat aircraft embracing our Scorpion HMD. For KAI we also supply rotary wing versions for their Light Armed and Marine Attack helicopters,” Thales Defense & Security’s Jim Geraghty stated.

“Scorpion’s simplified approach to platform integration, superior situational awareness, high reliability, and enhanced pilot comfort makes this system unmatched in the HMD marketspace.”

Future FA-50 Fleet Developments

South Korea plans to deliver the first 12 FA-50s to the Polish armed forces this year.

In August, Poland signed a $105-million contract with the US to procure Sniper Advanced Targeting Pods for the upcoming combat jets.

These “battle-proven” systems have an electro-optical targeting system and laser trackers to dominate moving aerial threats at a stand-off range.

In June, KAI rolled out the FA-50s eight months after the order. The aircraft were sent for flight tests the following month.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.8470895290374756}",positive,0.8470895290374756,1

Thales will equip the Polish Navy MIECZNIK frigates with the TACTICOS combat management system, sonars, infrared sensor and radars providing the warships with multiple functions for detection, identification, command and control and decision making. The first ship is expected to enter service in 2029 through a strategic programme, which incorporates a cooperation agreement between Thales and the PGZ-MIECZNIK Consortium (lead by Polska Grupa Zbrojeniowa).

Designed to carry out a wide range of tasks at sea, including, among others, securing sea lines of communication and critical infrastructure, the multi-role frigates of the MIECZNIK class will significantly increase the capabilities of the Polish Navy and be an important contribution of the Republic of Poland within the North Atlantic Alliance. These vessels will be equipped with a set of sensors developed by Thales and integrated with the warship's combat system.

Thales combat management system TACTICOS will be the central command and decision-making element of the frigate combat system. Its function and performance – supporting sensor control, picture compilation, situation assessment, action support and weapon control – are critical to the operational effectiveness of a naval vessel.

Poland's MIECZNIK frigates will rely on a complete Thales sonar suite comprising the BlueHunter hull-mounted sonar and the Captas-2 towed-array sonar providing a multi-sensor assessment of the overall underwater situation.

In addition, Thales will provide two highly complementary radars, the SM400 Block 2 and the NS50. The SM400 radar, a multifunction S-Band radar, is designed to simultaneously provide long-range air and surface surveillance, helicopter control and weapon control functions at a range up to 400 km. The NS50 radar, together with TSA 6000 IFF1 interrogator, offers an additional layer of protection providing superior air and surface detection, tracking and classification. The frigates will also be equipped with ARTEMIS, a 360° naval infrared search and track system, and the STIR 1.2 EO Mk2 fire control radar.

With the support of the UK Government and working together with Babcock and MBDA, Thales will put key learnings from the Type 31 programme in the UK into good use to reduce risk and ease the path to vessel acceptance. Moreover Thales will contribute to consolidate Poland’s local defence industry by working with the PGZ-MIECZNIK Consortium and other Polish industry actors.

“The contract provides a solid foundation for joint endeavour and the tremendous value that can be achieved through collaboration is a key aspect of strategic partnership. Therefore, a set of selected sensors and effectors will be integrated with TACTICOS CMS independently by PGZ thanks to the knowledge transfer from Thales“, Cezary Cierzan, Department of Maritime Technologies Director, PGZ

“As one of our closest Allies, we continue to strengthen our partnership with Poland to help ensure European security. These new Polish frigates, equipped with some of the best of British industry behind them, will be a formidable addition to Poland’s fleet, bolstering NATO’s capabilities”, James Cartlidge MP, Minister for Defence Procurement.

“This is a huge success for Thales, aided by the support of the British government. We look forward to continuing our historic relationship with Poland to the benefit of both nations.” Alex Cresswell, Chief Executive Thales in the UK.

""Our relationship with the Polish Navy dates back many years and we are proud that we have been selected for this major programme after 2 years of developing the solution with PGZ. We look forward to bringing Thales engineering and technology on board these ships and working with Polish industry to support the Polish Navy"", Dirk Jan de Bruijn Vice President Above Water Systems, Thales.

Announces the establishment of a world-class major Air Traffic Management (ATM) Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Singapore, together with investments in Research & Development, strengthening the value chain to accelerate joint innovation with regional civil aviation authorities.

Launches ScaleFlyt Remote ID, the first commercial drone platform that manages identification and tracking of drones, fully designed, developed and ‘Made-in-Singapore’.

Inaugurates the Thales Singapore Defence Hub with three pillars in Services, Engineering and Research.

Thales in Singapore plans to recruit more than 1000 people over the next three years.





On 5th October, Thales, the global technology and defence leader, celebrated 50 years of operations in Singapore at a gala event hosted by Chairman and CEO of Thales Group, Patrice Caine and senior management executives. With Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies Heng Swee Keat as the Guest-of-Honour, Thales announced several new investments in the country.

Thales first established its presence in Singapore in 1973 to support aeronautics-related activities across Asia Pacific (APAC). Over the years, Thales has grown its capabilities and solutions to include national defence, space, transportation and most recently, digital identity & security solutions following the successful acquisition and integration of Gemalto in 2019.

Air Traffic Management Centre of Excellence

The Singapore Air Transport Industry Transformation Map (ITM) 2025 outlines key priorities to transform Singapore into a future-ready global aviation hub, including building a safe and sustainable air hub and pursuing innovation in better air traffic and unmanned systems.

To this end, Thales has decided to establish an ATM Centre of Excellence in Singapore located at Thales’ premises at Ayer Rajah Crescent. ​

The CoE will work on industrial applications and design activities for its world-leading Air Traffic Management system - TopSky-ATC, while also engaging regional air navigation service providers in future collaboration and innovation in the airspace. The ambition is to develop partnerships with SMEs, academia and other ATM stakeholders in the region to build an open and collaborative ATM ecosystem.

Over the next three years, the CoE will ramp up activities to promote the development of the ATM sector in Asia, leveraging the high level of expertise already established in Singapore. This will include additional hiring, with the ambition of having 120 ATM experts located in Singapore in the coming years.

ScaleFlyt Remote ID – Proudly ‘Invented and Made-in-Singapore’

As drones become increasingly ubiquitous, ensuring the airspace remains safe and secure is essential. A strong regulatory framework is necessary, including the ability for operators and regulators to develop a reliable and safe drone ecosystem.

ScaleFlyt Remote ID acts as a remote identification and location system for drones. The device was designed by the Thales Drone team in Singapore, which combines the competencies and resources of Thales’ Avionics and Digital Identity & Security expertise, with the strong support of the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB). The product was trialled and certified over the past two years, and is the first UAV product designed and developed in Singapore and ready for commercial use in the global market. ​

With the ScaleFlyt Remote ID tracker, drones can communicate vital information such as location, altitude, and identification to air traffic controllers and other airspace stakeholders. This real-time sharing of data ensures situational awareness and allows for effective coordination between drone operators and airspace owners, mitigating risks of airspace conflicts.

With this commercial first from Singapore, Thales intends to expand its drone activity in the future to include digital flight avionics and Urban Air Mobility solutions.

Opening of the Defence Hub

Thales also officially opens the Singapore Defence Hub on 6th October, with three pillars in Services, Engineering and Research. ​ The Defence Hub will enhance long-term defence capabilities including maintenance, support, operational availability and indigenous development to meet the needs of the Singapore Armed Forces. A seasoned pool of experts situated in-country allows for a faster turnaround time and more hands-on approach to adapt to customer requirements and strengthen customer intimacy.

“Singapore is a strategic country for Thales, and a regional innovative hub for Asia. These announcements illustrate Singapore and Thales’ joint innovation and digital ambitions, building together a more sustainable aviation future and more resilient defense capabilities serving Singapore Armed Forces. By growing local capabilities in close proximity to our customers and partners, we are providing technologies for a safer and more secure society across Asia.” Patrice CAINE, Chairman and CEO, Thales Group.

Thales FlytLINK Connectivity Demonstrator Streams from Stratosphere on Perlan 2 Historic High-Altitude Research Glider - Thales,"Mon, 30 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGFsZXNncm91cC5jb20vZW4vY291bnRyaWVzLWV1cm9wZS91bml0ZWQta2luZ2RvbS9uZXdzL3RoYWxlcy1mbHl0bGluay1jb25uZWN0aXZpdHktZGVtb25zdHJhdG9yLXN0cmVhbXMtc3RyYXRvc3BoZXJl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales FlytLINK Connectivity Demonstrator Streams from Stratosphere on Perlan 2 Historic High-Altitude Research Glider Share this article



LinkedIn

The Thales FlytLINK™ Connectivity Demonstrator recently took aircraft connectivity to record-breaking heights by streaming real-time video footage from over 60,000 feet aboard the Perlan Mission 2 glider.

The US-based Airbus Perlan Mission II initiative, led by Nevada-based atmospheric research non-profit The Perlan Project, began its fifth experimental flight campaign in early August at Comandante Armando Tola International Airport in El Calafate, Argentina.

The team’s effort focused on continuing its mission to advance aerospace engineering and scientific research, explore areas of the stratosphere never before reached by an experimental pressurised glider – the Perlan 2 – and share its journey and research with the world.

Thales onboard

Thales enabled the group to bring its flights to global audiences with the first real-time view streamed from the historic Perlan 2 glider’s tail camera, as it soared above the Andes mountain range. Watching were millions of people including aerospace and climate scientists, educators, and high-school and university students whose Cubesat experiments were aboard the aircraft, collecting data from the atmosphere’s upper regions.

“The Perlan Project’s mission is to explore, innovate, and inspire. Our collaboration with Thales is a great example of how we’re succeeding at all three of those goals to advance the possibilities of aerospace engineering and technology,” said Ed Warnock, CEO of the Perlan Project. “We were thrilled to have the Thales FlytLINKTM Connectivity Demonstrator helping us bring our exciting aerospace adventure to the world in real-time.”

The Thales FlytLINKTM Connectivity Demonstrator was installed on the Perlan 2 glider as well as on the Grob Egrett, the high-altitude research aircraft that towed Perlan 2 aloft to begin its record-breaking flight. Video cameras aboard both aircraft provided video for the Virtual Cockpit livestream, including epic vistas from soaring far into the stratosphere.

The world’s highest Wi-Fi hotspot

Developed by Thales Flight Avionics Connectivity team in the UK and US, the Thales FlytLINK™ Connectivity Demonstrator completed beta testing in the US earlier this year before undergoing final tests in Patagonia. And with Perlan reaching 60,300 feet, it becomes the world’s highest-ever Wi-Fi hotspot on an aircraft.

While aircraft connectivity isn’t a new concept, what distinguishes the Perlan 2 is the stratospheric altitudes and high latitudes it operates at – much higher than the typical 42,000-foot altitude of the highest commercial airline traffic.

Perlan 2 uses unique wind currents from the Andes called stratospheric mountain waves, which are strengthened by the polar vortex, to reach amazing altitudes without an engine.

The live stream was possible due to Videosoft Global’s next-generation FireLight software, an ultra-low bandwidth streaming solution developed by the specialist video compression company. The real-time transmission was broadcast via Thales FlytLINK™ Connectivity Demonstrator to the Iridium network at a data rate of only 22kbps. This gave an astonishing front-row view to followers on the ground as the glider soared to the edge of space.

“Although we have customers around the globe using our software, this was the first time anyone was able to stream secure live video over a commercial satellite network from these altitudes with such a small amount of bandwidth. We feel privileged to have been part of such an important aviation project,” said Stewart McCone, CEO, Videosoft Global.

As well as live streaming video, Thales FlytLINK™ Connectivity Demonstrator had other real-time onboard applications. These included sharing the glider’s location and orientation, AI-optimized flight planning using Thales’ AI toolkit, and providing up-to-date weather information to pilots.

A new era for the connected aircraft

Building on more than 30 years’ experience in satellite communications, Thales FlytLINK™ Connectivity Demonstrator showcased the seamless, reliable connectivity capabilities of the new Thales FlytLINK™ portfolio, which offers world-class airborne satellite communications equipment, airtime connectivity plans, and services for a vast range of crewed and uncrewed aircraft.

“The demonstrator has proved its broad connectivity capabilities, but what’s really exciting is how we integrated them into the Airbus Perlan Mission II platform to beam down live video to the ground, so everyone had a bird’s eye view and could experience the world-record with the crew,” said Marc Duval Destin, VP Strategy, Product Policy and Innovation at Thales.

Thales is taking the reality of ‘Connected Aircraft’ to new heights and, along with our partnerships, we’re enabling pilots, crews, and passengers to all benefit from secure, reliable in-flight connectivity that Thales customers are using to improve operational performance, increase flight efficiencies, reduce emissions, and enhance the onboard experience for everyone, including passengers.

Oracle sovereign cloud solutions: Increased control with OCI External KMS - Oracle,"Thu, 05 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vYmxvZ3Mub3JhY2xlLmNvbS9jbG91ZC1pbmZyYXN0cnVjdHVyZS9wb3N0L29yYWNsZS1zb3ZlcmVpZ24tY2xvdWQtc29sdXRpb25zLW9jaS1leHRlcm5hbC1rbXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This blog post is part 6 of our multipart series on data sovereignty in the cloud.

When understanding encryption, you have a lot of ground to cover. Our last post in the series, Secure your data with enhanced cryptographic solutions, looked at how Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) customers can benefit from cryptographic solutions, including vaults, hardware security modules (HSM), and confidential computing. Using tools like these can be crucial to maintaining control over the data you place in the cloud.

Now, we want to dive deeper into encryption keys, specifically who is managing the encryption keys you use in the cloud and where are the keys being held. To further ensure data sovereignty, many regulators have started to require that the key creation process occur outside the cloud where you host your data. For this reason, OCI offers the Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) feature for OCI Vault to encrypt resources with keys created outside of OCI.

We also recently announced OCI External KMS (EKMS), which goes one step further and keeps your master encryption keys outside of OCI at all times. Often called “Hold Your Own Key” (HYOK), this approach to key management is considered by many to be the pinnacle of enhanced data sovereignty. We’re incredibly excited to add EKMS to our portfolio of key management services and continue providing customers with the tools they need to implement secure data protection strategies.

What is OCI External KMS and how does it work?

Built in partnership with the Thales Group, OCI EKMS enables organizations to store their OCI keys externally on virtual or physical Thales CipherTrust Cloud Key Manager (CCKM) appliances. Using Thales CCKM, organizations can store their keys in a FIPS 140-2 Level 3 appliance and have the flexibility to choose the location of their encryption keys to ensure data can’t be read outside of certain national boundaries. This function includes the capability to store and manage cloud and on-premises keys with the same CCKM appliance for a seamless experience for existing Thales customers.

EKMS uses Thales’ HYOK functionality and enables customers to encrypt their data using encryption keys that are created and managed by the customer outside of a customer’s OCI tenancy. EKMS encryption keys always stay within the custody of the customer and are never imported into OCI, putting customers in control of the physical storage of keys outside the cloud. This service helps OCI customers address their data protection and regulatory requirements and be assured that their keys are never managed by Oracle operators.

Using EKMS also provides an extra level of protection by disabling master encryption keys from your own key management system, and in the event of a security incident, data in the cloud is prevented from being decrypted. Regardless of which OCI deployment model you choose, whether OCI’s public cloud, Oracle EU Sovereign Cloud, or an OCI Dedicated Region, you have access to all of the same key management features.

Combine EKMS with Oracle EU Sovereign Cloud to strengthen your sovereignty posture

If you aren’t already familiar with Oracle EU Sovereign Cloud, these OCI data regions located in EU-based data centers are physically isolated from other Oracle commercial public cloud regions. The EU Sovereign Cloud regions are owned by dedicated Oracle European legal entities and operated and supported by EU residents. These features enable commercial and public sector organizations to place sensitive data and applications in the cloud and align with EU data protection requirements.

Complementing EU Sovereign Cloud with the EKMS feature on Thales CCKM provides customers with more security control capabilities to strengthen their sovereignty strategy. EKMS allows segregation of duty between the key management and custody solution and the encrypted resources in OCI. Furthermore, by using solutions from Thales, an EU company with Common Criteria certified HSM solutions, customer ownership and control of encryption always keeps customers in control of their data encryption.

It’s no coincidence that we launched the Oracle EU Sovereign Cloud regions and OCI EKMS only a few months apart. The data sovereignty landscape is rapidly changing, and nowhere is this shift more apparent than in the EU. For customers in the EU to meet their regulatory requirements, technological solutions need to keep pace with the evolving environment.

Getting started with Oracle Sovereign Cloud solutions

At Oracle, we firmly believe that one cloud doesn’t fit all. We’ve seen firsthand how the needs of our customers vary depending on the region they’re located, the industry they operate in, and the type of data they’re managing. Some customers’ IT strategies involve using multiple clouds or keeping specific applications or workloads on-premises.

We’re committed to building simple, customizable solutions and industry-leading capabilities that help you realize your business objectives and regulatory requirements. This latest partnership with Thales to develop OCI EKMS is just another example of how Oracle is putting the customer first to deliver data security and sovereignty solutions.

In this series, we’ve already covered how access to data is restricted within OCI and how customers can implement a least-privileged access model. But what does this model look like when a law enforcement agency requests access to your data? In the next post in the sovereign cloud series, we focus on how Oracle handles and reports on extraterritorial law enforcement requests for data access, including interactions with local authorities.

If you have any questions about OCI’s new EKMS service or want to learn more about Oracle sovereign cloud solutions, contact one of our representatives.

Thales To Equip Polish Navy's MIECZNIK Frigates With - MarineLink,"Thu, 05 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmluZWxpbmsuY29tL25ld3MvdGhhbGVzLWVxdWlwLXBvbGlzaC1uYXZ5cy1taWVjem5pay01MDg1NTDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales said Thursday it would equip the Polish Navy MIECZNIK (Swordfish) frigates with the TACTICOS combat management system, sonars, infrared sensor, and radars, providing the warships with multiple functions for detection, identification, command and control, and decision-making.

The first ship is expected to enter service in 2029 through a strategic program, which incorporates a cooperation agreement between Thales and the PGZ-MIECZNIK Consortium (lead by Polska Grupa Zbrojeniowa).

Designed to carry out a wide range of tasks at sea, including, among others, securing sea lines of communication and critical infrastructure, the multi-role frigates of the MIECZNIK class will significantly increase the capabilities of the Polish Navy and be an important contribution of Poland within the North Atlantic Alliance. These vessels will be equipped with a set of sensors developed by Thales and integrated with the warship's combat system.

Thales said its combat management system TACTICOS would be the central command and decision-making element of the frigate combat system.

Its function and performance – supporting sensor control, picture compilation, situation assessment, action support, and weapon control – are critical to the operational effectiveness of a naval vessel.

Poland's MIECZNIK frigates will rely on a complete Thales sonar suite comprising the BlueHunter hull-mounted sonar and the Captas-2 towed-array sonar providing a multi-sensor assessment of the overall underwater situation.

In addition, Thales will provide two radars, the SM400 Block 2 and the NS50. The SM400 radar, a multifunction S-Band radar, is designed to simultaneously provide long-range air and surface surveillance, helicopter control and weapon control functions at a range up to 400 km. The NS50 radar, together with TSA 6000 IFF interrogator, offers an additional layer of protection, providing superior air and surface detection, tracking and classification. The frigates will also be equipped with ARTEMIS, a 360° naval infrared search and track system, and the STIR 1.2 EO Mk2 fire control radar.

""With the support of the UK Government and working together with Babcock and MBDA, Thales will put key learnings from the Type 31 program in the UK into good use to reduce risk and ease the path to vessel acceptance. Moreover, Thales will contribute to consolidating Poland’s local defense industry by working with the PGZ-MIECZNIK Consortium and other Polish industry actors,"" Thales said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9759559631347656}",neutral,0.9759559631347656,0
EU Approves Hitachi Rail's $1.7 Billion-Euro Acquisition of Thales' Railway - PYMNTS.com,"Mon, 30 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vY3BpLXBvc3RzL2V1LWFwcHJvdmVzLWhpdGFjaGktcmFpbHMtMS03LWJpbGxpb24tZXVyby1hY3F1aXNpdGlvbi1vZi10aGFsZXMtcmFpbHdheS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The European Union (EU) announced on Monday that it has granted conditional approval for Hitachi Rail’s acquisition of France’s Thales’ railway signalling business, a deal worth 1.7 billion euros ($1.8 billion). The decision marks a significant development in the world of rail transportation as both companies are renowned leaders in the supply of railway signalling services within Europe.

Hitachi Rail, a subsidiary of Japan’s global conglomerate Hitachi, initiated the acquisition bid for Thales’ ground transportation business back in 2021. The move garnered substantial attention in the railway industry due to the potential implications for competition in the sector, per Reuters.

In response to concerns about competition, the European Commission, the EU’s influential antitrust authority, revealed that Hitachi Rail had proposed specific remedies. The main condition for approval was that Hitachi Rail would divest its primary signalling platforms in France and Germany, which are utilized for interlockings, overlay, and resignalling projects.

The European Commission stated in an official release, “Hitachi Rail offered to divest its mainline signalling platforms in France and Germany for interlockings, overlay, and resignalling projects. These commitments fully address the competition concerns identified by the Commission.” This move was aimed at ensuring that the acquisition would not stifle competition and, consequently, maintain affordable prices, high-quality services, and innovation for infrastructure managers and customers.

EU’s acting competition commissioner, Didier Reynders, emphasized the significance of the divestiture, saying, “The divestiture… will preserve competition and ensure that infrastructure managers, and ultimately customers, do not face increased prices, lower quality, and less innovation.”

The approval from the EU comes after Britain’s competition regulator had already given its green light to the acquisition, imposing similar conditions. Hitachi Rail committed to divest its signalling businesses in the United Kingdom as part of its efforts to address competition concerns in the British market.

Image courtesy Thales WASHINGTON, D.C. The U.S. Army has expanded its order with Thales for over 7,000 Combat Net Radios (CNR), marking a follow-up order in an ongoing dual-vendor, multi-year contract, according to a company statement.

These CNRs, which are designed to replace the older Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) radios, are intended to provide communication in many conditions and enhance various combat weapon systems within the Army's collection, the statement reads.

Based on the Improved Multiband Inter/Intra Team Radio (IMBITR) technology, the Thales RT-2129 CNR is designed for compatibility with the existing SINCGARS waveform, which will enable the Army to integrate enhanced waveforms as needed, the company says.

The Army's updated radio solution, which is centered around the AN/PRC-148 handheld radio family, transitions from the legacy RT-1523 radio units. To this point, the Army's orders have surpassed 8,100 CNRs in total.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9990749359130859}",positive,0.9990749359130859,1

The initial contract was awarded to both Thales and L3Harris and has a ceiling total value of USD 6 Bn (EUR 5.69 Bn).

The CNR is a single-channel voice and data radio that is part of a holistic effort to phase out legacy Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) mounted and dismounted radios across the US armed forces.

As a fully software-defined radio (SDR), the Thales CNR ensures interoperability with the legacy SINCGARS waveform while enabling the army to quickly add improved waveforms to address evolving requirements. Built around the battle proven AN/PRC-148 handheld family of radios and based on Improved Multiband Inter/Intra Team Radio (IMBITR) technology, the Thales CNR provides the US Army with “a crypto- modernised tactical radio solution”, Thales stated in a press release. The company added that the US Army order demonstrated “the service’s continued confidence in Thales’ ability to deliver next-generation radios for the army’s network modernisation effort”.

Under the latest award Thales will deliver more than 7,000 RT-2129 Tactical Secure Voice Crypto Interoperability Standard (TSVCIS)-compliant radios.

According to the US Army’s Program Executive Office Command, Control, Communications – Tactical (PEO C3T), “CNR-enabled communications will be used for voice transmission of command and control between surface and airborne command-and-control assets but will also be used to transmit and receive secure data, including position location information within a network via radio-based situational awareness and will function as a digital data radio.”

The CNR IDIQ contract includes a five-year base and an additional five-year option. PEO C3T says the army “will field to its first CNR-equipped unit in 4QFY24/1QFY25, with final delivery in the 2030 timeframe”.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.967985212802887}",positive,0.967985212802887,1

Investing in STEM

The proceeds from selling aged test equipment is being used to inspire a new generation of students to take up STEM subjects and join the next generation of young engineers.

This year Measurement Equipment Management Services (MEMS), part of Test Engineering in the UK, received £36,000 from sales of used test equipment nationwide.

Whilst a significant amount has been re-invested in new test equipment, a total of £8000 will go to schools with which Thales has built links in each of the four Business Units present in the UK.

Simon Goyder, UK MEMS Manager said: “We wanted to invest in supporting STEM teaching in the UK and we have the chance to give them grants so they can go out and buy their own equipment.”

He added: “The feedback so far from schools has been amazing. They are so pleased with the money that will help them run STEM projects for their students.”

Based in Crawley, Simon’s role is to coordinate teams at sites in each Business Unit into a whole-UK organisation that looks after all of Thales’s test engineering equipment.

Simon’s teams are responsible for purchasing new equipment. The equipment can include anything from oscilloscopes to multimeters and power supplies and is used by all the Business Units in the UK.

“Every year we assess the equipment we hold and anything no longer required is then sold to specialist companies.

STEM projects based in schools in Belfast, Glasgow and Crawley and Templecombe will all benefit from the grant.

Supporting the next generation of engineers

Simon added: “It’s important to support the creation, growth and development of the next generation of engineers. Thales and the country needs more engineers and we want to help schools to get young people interested in mechanical and electrical engineering to enter STEM careers. And some of these young engineers could one day become engineers in Thales.”

Work has already been started on identifying test equipment to be disposed of in next year’s round and Simon hopes they can repeat the donation for 2024.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9988486766815186}",neutral,0.9988486766815186,0

EUROPE: The European Commission has approved Hitachi Rail’s proposed €1·66bn acquisition of Thales’ Ground Transportation Systems business, subject to agreed divestments to preserve competition in the signalling market.

The announcement on October 30 means the deal has now been cleared by all 13 competition authorities which reviewed it. Welcoming the news, Thales said it expected the transaction to be completed in the first half of 2024.

The Commission’s investigation found that the transaction as initially notified would have produced a merged entity with a very high share of the markets for main line signalling projects in France (including interlockings, overlay and resignalling projects) and Germany (including overlay and resignalling projects). This would have reduced competition and potentially led to higher prices and less innovation.

To address these concerns, Hitachi Rail offered to divest its interlocking, overlay and resignalling activities in France and Germany.

The Commission agreed that the proposed mitigations would ‘fully address’ its concerns and preserve competition, adding that the purchaser would be able to run the divested business as a viable competitive force. The Commission said it would closely monitor the divestment process, and would have to approve the purchaser.

‘Hitachi and Thales are close competitors in main line signalling, notably in France and Germany’, explained Didier Reynders, who recently took over from Margrethe Vestager as Commissioner in charge of EU competition policy. ‘The divestiture of their activities in these countries will preserve competition and ensure that infrastructure managers, and ultimately customers, do not face increased prices, lower quality and less innovation.’

Hitachi Rail has also committed to divest its main line signalling business in the UK to address concerns raised by the UK’s Competition & Markets Authority.

The company said both divestments would be undertaken in accordance with all relevant processes and in consultation with the affected employees and their representatives.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9993172883987427}",neutral,0.9993172883987427,0
"Australia invests in expanding 155mm munitions, aerial bomb capacity - Defense News","Fri, 06 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9nbG9iYWwvYXNpYS1wYWNpZmljLzIwMjMvMTAvMDYvYXVzdHJhbGlhLWludmVzdHMtaW4tZXhwYW5kaW5nLTE1NW1tLW11bml0aW9ucy1hZXJpYWwtYm9tYi1jYXBhY2l0eS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Australia is investing AU$220 million (U.S. $139 million) to boost munitions production at two factories in the country’s southeast, the government said in a statement Friday.

The investment will boost production capacity for 155mm artillery ammunition and 500-pound aerial bombs at Thales-managed factories in Mulwala, New South Wales, and Benalla, Victoria.

With the war in Ukraine putting renewed emphasis on conventional fires, including 155mm artillery, Australia’s Defense Strategic Review has recommended local manufacturing of weapons to ensure stocks are maintained. The U.S. and the EU have been racing to keep up with Ukraine’s demand for artillery rounds in the high-intensity conflict with Russia.

“Improving Australia’s ability to manufacture the munitions our defense force needs is not only critical to meeting the strategic challenges we face as a nation, it will also support local industry and well-paid, skilled local jobs,” Minister for Defence Industry Pat Conroy said in the statement.

Infrastructure redevelopments at both sites will ensure they’re equipped to support future production demands, including for 155mm ammunition, with new explosive mixers at the Mulwala factory allowing for faster production of a broader range of advanced munitions, according to the government.

The investment will boost capacity to produce the BLU-111(AUS) aerial bomb, manufactured domestically by Thales Australia. Australia first deployed the 500-pound high-explosive warhead on the F-35A in a laser-guided bomb configuration in 2021, and the ordnance replaces the older-generation Mk82 500-pound iron bombs.

The ability to bring the BLU-111 into service as an Australia-manufactured munition is a “significant milestone,” Conroy said.

The government said the investment shows it delivering on the priorities of the strategic review, by establishing local manufacturing of guided weapons and explosive ordnance. The Australian Army operates the M777 155mm towed gun as its main artillery piece, and Conroy said the investment will accelerate domestic production of ordnance such as 155mm artillery ammunition.

France and Australia said in January they would jointly supply 155mm ammunition to Ukraine, with French contractor Nexter manufacturing the artillery shells and Australia providing the explosive.

“The Mulwala and Benalla munition factories underpin Australia’s ability to develop critical propellants, explosives and munitions for the Australian Defence Force,” Conroy said.

Investments in new preparation and mixing equipment will increase the size of rocket motors that can be manufactured at Mulwala by 500%, which in turn supports the production of advanced guided weapons and hypersonic weapons, Thales Australia said in a separate statement Friday. The company operates the government-owned sites at Benalla and Mulwala under contract, employing more than 650 staff there to manufacture munitions systems.

In a release, Terveystalo says it hopes the digital identity platform will accelerate its digital transformation in order to make access to its services faster and more secure for customers.

Danny de Vreeze, VP of Identity and Access Management products at Thales, says the deal is a natural fit for the French firm, which invests in “deep tech” innovations such as advanced biometrics, AI and quantum computing, but is also among North America’s leading providers of physical and mobile driver’s licenses.

“Digital identity is in our DNA,” says de Vreeze. “We’re looking forward to building a collaboration based on trust, to provide a competitive advantage that firmly establishes Terveystalo as the leading Nordic healthcare provider – and further strengthens the company’s strategy of delivering integrated, data-driven care with best-in-class outcomes.”

A third spoke in the deal came care of Nordic cybersecurity firm, Nixu, which helped broker the deal by providing a technical evaluation of the OneWelcome identity platform and synchronizing the mitigation plan.

Thales has credited some of its recent growth to its digital ID and security sales. This year, the firm won a contract to supply the biometric technology to be embedded in Finnish passports, eID cards and eResident Permits, and a shared contract to supply electronics and software for security in U.S. passports.

Thales CEO sees more efficient flightpaths offering significant fuel savings - Flightglobal,"Mon, 09 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mbGlnaHRnbG9iYWwuY29tL2FpcmxpbmVzL3RoYWxlcy1jZW8tc2Vlcy1tb3JlLWVmZmljaWVudC1mbGlnaHRwYXRocy1vZmZlcmluZy1zaWduaWZpY2FudC1mdWVsLXNhdmluZ3MvMTU1Mjg2LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales chief executive Patrice Caine believes efficient flightpaths can immediately reduce the airline industry’s fuel burn, but that regulators and the carriers themselves need to drive the initiative forward.

Caine says that improved flight trajectories could quickly contribute fuel savings in the region of 10% if they were adopted widely.

“These different features will allow airlines and civil aviation authorities to really optimise their flight trajectories,” says Caine. “When we simulate all this, potentially they will save 10% of fuel consumption.”

Caine made the remarks in Singapore, where Thales recently celebrated its 50th anniversary in the city state. The company marked the occasion by announcing the establishment of a new centre for Air Traffic Management (ATM), which will explore ways to improve ATM efficiency.

On the readiness of airlines and air navigation service providers (ANSPs) to better optimise flightpaths, Caine said that acceptance is growing, but that civil aviation authorities and airlines still need convincing.

Airlines need to be sold on the idea because it could involve require the retrofit of new flight management systems on legacy aircraft. But even older, less efficient aircraft will see lower fuel consumption through more efficient flightpaths.

He believes the technology for improved flightpaths is quite mature and ready to be deployed.

Caine implies that more efficient ATM is all but inevitable given growing public concerns about the environment. He also notes that other emissions-reducing technologies, such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), are many years away from making a major impact.

“It’s short-term compared to other things that we need to do, like SAF or new engines, which are more in terms of tens of years rather than a couple of years [away].”

While he does not believe improved flight trajectories will be widely adopted in the next one or two years, he feels that their greater adoption will definitely take place within the next 10 years.

Speaking alongside Caine, Thales Singapore country director Emily Tan contends that the company’s existing relationships with both civil aviation authorities and airlines positions it well to help promote the move to more efficient flightpaths.

“To do this, we need collaboration among air navigation service provides and collaboration with the airlines,” says Tan.

“The ANSPs have existing systems, so how do they modify and adapt? Thales wants to bring a technological foundation to enable ANSPs to collaborate better, enable them to utilise technology, and optimise flights.”","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9902065396308899}",positive,0.9902065396308899,1

Today, No. 10 Downing Street hosted a significant roundtable event, with representatives from industry and academia, including The Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET), Social Mobility, Youth and Progression Minister Mims Davies MP and our Chief Technical Officer, Dr Paul Gosling. The discussion was focused on the following question: How can improving the provision of engineering skills reduce disparities, improve social mobility and diversity within the STEM workforce?

Central to this dialogue was the IET's 'Engineering Kids’ Futures' report. This in-depth exploration into STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education offers a blueprint for renewing our approach to nurturing engineering skills from a young age. It illustrates the mutual benefits of early engineering exposure for both students and the nation's economic resilience. Yet, some alarming statistics underscore the pressing need for action.

Challenges in the UK STEM sector

The UK currently faces a staggering shortfall of over 173,000 STEM workers. On average, businesses in the UK grapple with ten unfilled roles, primarily due to the widening skills gap. This deficiency is costing the UK economy an estimated £1.5bn annually. What's even more concerning is that this challenge has persisted for 15 years, a duration longer than a primary school student's entire education.

Dr Paul Gosling, Chief Technical Officer at Thales UK, shared his insights at the roundtable:

""The prosperity of companies like Thales hinges upon the consistent inflow of young, passionate engineers. Both public and private sectors must rally behind initiatives that elevate engineering education. Our future economic landscape will be moulded by today's students. By laying a robust foundation in engineering, we pave the way for a brighter, more innovative future.""

Almost half of engineering employers face difficulties due to their staff lacking in essential IT skills or adapting to new technologies. With these challenges at the forefront, promoting engineering in schools becomes more than an educational strategy; it's an economic imperative. Early exposure to engineering, as highlighted by the 'Engineering Kids’ Futures report, can lead to a 5% surge in productivity, which can translate to billions in the national economy.

Investing in STEM education

The roundtable at No. 10 Downing Street not only reflected the UK government's commitment to fortifying STEM education but also showcased its intent to translate the recommendations of the 'Engineering Kids’ Futures report into tangible strategies.

Collaborative efforts, like the one between Thales UK and IET, signify more than a partnership. They reflect the industry's collective resolve to refashion the nation's educational landscape in favour of engineering. As the horizon unveils, it becomes evident that the UK's future economy will be sculpted by the imagination, creativity, and skills of its youngest people.

For entities like Thales and the UK at large, the onus is clear: The economy's future rests with young engineers, and the responsibility lies with us to ensure they are well-prepared with the necessary skills, enthusiasm, and opportunities to sculpt it.

By examining the data, Honeywell discerned opportunities to refine the APU's performance without drastic alterations to the machinery.

Beyond this, Honeywell has a suite of connected solutions that extract data from aircraft engines and systems. Such data-centric methodologies enable the creation of actionable recommendations. Shilliday elaborated, “We can make recommendations based on these things that you can do as an airline or as a private jet operator to improve your fuel efficiency, but it really comes down to how they want to operate the aircraft. So we try and give them those suggestions, and then they can use those tools to tailor it within their own specific operations.""

For GE Aerospace, while the introduction of new engine technologies is undeniably a focus, they recognize the inherent value of digital tools in driving immediate change. A spokesperson for the company pointed to a range of software applications developed by GE that aim to minimize CO2 emissions and bolster operational efficiency.

The Scorpion HMD equips pilots with enhanced situational awareness by providing an augmented picture of the pilot’s environment. Scorpion uses full-colour symbology, zero-perceived latency, and a single display module for both day and night operations – all at reduced life-cycle costs.

Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) developed the FA-50 Fighting Eagle, a light combat aircraft for the South Korean Air Force, which entered service in 2006.

The FA-50 measures 13.14m in length, 9.45m in width, and 4.82m in height. The empty weight of the aircraft is 6.47 tonnes (t). It can take-off with a maximum gross weight of 12.3t.

In September 2022, the Polish Government contracted KAI to deliver 48 FA-50 aircraft to replace the ageing MiG-29 aircraft in the Polish Air Force.

In June this year, the first units were produced and Poland’s Minister of National Defence, Mariusz Błaszczak, stated: “This is an extremely important moment for the [Polish] Air Force. We dispose of post-Soviet aircraft and from now on Polish combat aviation will only use F-16 and FA-50 aircraft, and soon also [the] F-35.

“These three types come from the same family of excellent and modern aircraft. This is a great asset when building an interoperable air defense system and a unified training system,” Błaszczak added.

“We are excited to add the FA-50 to the long list of highly capable combat aircraft embracing our Scorpion HMD,” said Jim Geraghty, vice president of Visionix, a division of Thales Defense & Security. “For KAI we also supply rotary wing versions for their Light Armed and Marine Attack helicopters.”

“Scorpion’s simplified approach to platform integration, superior situational awareness, high reliability and enhanced pilot comfort makes this system unmatched in the HMD marketplace.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6431089639663696}",neutral,0.6431089639663696,0

As a fully software-defined communications solution, the Thales CNR ensures interoperability with the legacy Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) waveform, as well as enables the Army to quickly add improved waveforms to address evolving requirements. The RT-2129 CNR is a critical component to the Army’s unified network providing robust communications capabilities to the tactical edge.

The Thales CNR, built around the battle-proven AN/PRC-148 handheld family of radios, provides the Army with a crypto-modernized tactical radio solution. The flexible software-defined solution enables the Army to seamlessly replace the legacy RT-1523 fleet of mounted and dismounted radios.

Under this award, Thales will deliver more than 7,000 RT-2129 Tactical Secure Voice Crypto Interoperability Standard (TSVCIS) compliant radios. To date, the Army has ordered more than 8,100 CNRs.

“The Combat Net Radio continues Thales’ tradition of being responsive to emerging needs in support of the warfighter with a next-generation radio that uses existing training, installation kits and system integration to ensure mission readiness,” said Mike Sheehan, CEO, Thales Defense and Security, Inc. “The CNR is designed to easily integrate into the Army’s Integrated Tactical Network and operate reliably under the most extreme conditions.”

Previous contract

On May 16, 2022, Thales announced it was one of two vendors to which the US Army had awarded a $6 billion-ceiling Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to deliver advanced tactical radios under the U.S. Army’s Combat Net Radio (CNR) modernization program. The competitive 10-year contract for the Combat Net Radio (CNR) program includes a five-year base ordering period and an additional five-year optional ordering period. This contract was awarded as part of an effort to retire its outdated Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS).

Under the Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, Thales will deliver a CNR that is based on the AN/PRC-148 Joint Tactical Radio System Enhanced Multiband Inter/Intra Team Radio (IMBITR) – the latest evolution of a family of battle-proven, tactical voice and data radios.

RCU Signs Partnership with Thales Group to Safeguard Heritage Sites in AlUla - Asharq Al-awsat - English,"Thu, 26 Oct 2023 05:40:48 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vZW5nbGlzaC5hYXdzYXQuY29tL2N1bHR1cmUvNDYyODg1Ni1yY3Utc2lnbnMtcGFydG5lcnNoaXAtdGhhbGVzLWdyb3VwLXNhZmVndWFyZC1oZXJpdGFnZS1zaXRlcy1hbHVsYdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Cambodia's Relocation of People from UNESCO Site Raises Concerns

It's been more than a year since Yem Srey Pin moved with her family from the village where she was born on Cambodia's Angkor UNESCO World Heritage site to Run Ta Ek, a dusty new settlement about 25 kilometers (15 miles) away.

A tattered Cambodian flag flaps gently in the scorching midday sun on her corner lot, its depiction of the Angkor Wat temple barely still visible, while her brother scoops water from a clay cistern onto a neighbor's cow that he tends during the day.

Hers is one of about 5,000 families relocated from the sprawling archaeological site, one of Southeast Asia’s top tourist draws, by Cambodian authorities in an ongoing program that Amnesty International has condemned as a “gross violation of international human rights law.” Another 5,000 families are still due to be moved.

The allegations have drawn strong expressions of concern from UNESCO and a spirited rebuttal from Cambodian authorities, who say they're doing nothing more than protecting the heritage land from illegal squatters, The Associated Press reported.

Yem Srey Pin's single-room home, its reused corrugated steel siding perforated by rust and old nail holes, is a far cry better than the makeshift tent she lived in with her husband and five children when they first arrived, which did little to protect from the monsoon rains and blew down in the winds.

And their 600-square-meter (6,500-square-foot) property is significantly bigger than the 90-square-meter (1,000-square-foot) plot they occupied illegally in the village of Khvean on the Angkor site.

But the 35-year-old is also in debt from building the new house. Her husband finds less construction work nearby and his wages are lower, and there are no wild fruits or vegetables she can forage, nor rice paddies where she can collect crabs to sell at her mother's stand.

“After more than a year here I haven't been able to save any money and I haven't earned anything,” she said, as her 12-year-old son rocked her 8-month-old daughter in a hammock in front of a fan to take the edge off midday heat nearing 40 degrees Celsius (topping 100 degrees Fahrenheit).

“Living here is just hand to mouth because the income we do have goes to pay for the rice, food and my children's school.”

The Angkor site is one of the largest archaeological sites in the world, spread across some 400 square kilometers (155 square miles) in northwestern Cambodia. It contains the ruins of Khmer Empire capitals from the 9th to 15th centuries, including the temple of Angkor Wat, featured on several Cambodian banknotes, such as the 2,000 riel note depicting rice farmers working fields around the temple, as well as the country's flag.

UNESCO calls it one of the most important archaeological sites in Southeast Asia, and it is critical to Cambodia’s tourism industry.

When it was inscribed as a World Heritage Site in 1992, it was named a “living heritage site” whose local population observed ancestral traditions and cultural practices that have disappeared elsewhere.

Still, UNESCO at the time noted that Angkor was under “dual pressures” from some 100,000 inhabitants in 112 historic settlements who “constantly try to expand their dwelling areas,” and from encroachment from the nearby town of Siem Reap.

Cambodia's answer was a plan to entice the 10,000 families illegally squatting in the area to resettle at Run Ta Ek and another site, as well as to encourage some from the 112 historic settlements to relocate as their families grow in size.

“People got married, they had children, so the number of people were on the rise, including those coming illegally,” said Long Kosal, deputy director general and spokesperson for the Cambodian agency known as APSARA that's responsible for managing the Angkor site.

“What we did was that we provided an option.”

Cambodia began moving people to Run Ta Ek in 2022, giving those who volunteered to leave their homes in the Angkor area plots of land, a two-month supply of canned food and rice, a tarp and 30 sheets of corrugated metal to use to build a home. Benefits also included a Poor Card, essentially a state welfare program giving them around 310,000 riel (about $75) monthly for 10 years.

In a November report, Amnesty questioned how voluntary the relocations actually were, saying many people they interviewed were threatened or coerced into moving and that the relocations were more “forced evictions in disguise.”

The rights group cited a speech from former Prime Minister Hun Sen in which he said people “must either leave the Angkor site soon and receive some form of compensation or be evicted at a later time and receive nothing.”

Amnesty also noted Hun Sen's track record, saying that under his long-time rule Cambodian authorities had been responsible for several forced evictions elsewhere that it alleged “constituted gross violations of human rights.” It said Run Ta Ek — with dirt roads, insufficient drainage, poor sanitation and other issues — did not fulfil international obligations under human rights treaties to provide people adequate housing.

That has now changed: Homes with outhouses have been built, roads paved, and sewers installed. Primitive hand pumps made of blue PVC piping provide water, and electricity has been run in.

There's a school, a health center, a temple; bus routes were added, and a market area was built but is not yet operating, Long Kosal said, according to AP.

Hun Sen's successor, his son Hun Manet, traveled to Run Ta Ek in December to meet with residents and highlight infrastructure improvements in an attempt to allay the growing international concerns surrounding Cambodia's most important tourist site.

He reiterated his father's contention that if the squatters are not removed, the site risks being delisted by UNESCO — something UNESCO has never threatened.

Amnesty itself concedes life has gotten better for the residents of Run Ta Ek, but maintains there are major concerns.

Families have had to take on heavy debt to build even their basic houses, there is little work to be found, and the village — without any significant tree cover — is swelteringly hot during the day and has little shelter from winds or monsoon rains, said Montse Ferrer, the head of Amnesty’s research team investigating the Angkor Wat resettlements.

“People no longer have income,” she said in an interview in Geneva. “They had a clear source of income at the time — tourism — but also other sources of income linked to the location at Angkor. They are now at least 30 minutes away from the site and can no longer access these sources.”

Following Amnesty's scathing report, UNESCO moved up the timeline for Cambodia's submission of its own report on the state of conservation at the Angkor site, specifically asking for the allegations to be addressed.

In that report, submitted to UNESCO in March, Cambodia said it had not violated any international laws with the relocations, saying it was only moving people involved in the “illegal occupation of heritage land” and that in Run Ta Ek many were now property owners for the first time in their lives.

UNESCO said it would not comment on the situation until it has been able to analyze Cambodia's response, but referred The Associated Press to previous comments from Lazare Eloundou Assomo, director of the UNESCO World Heritage Center.

Speaking after Amnesty released its report, he stressed the agency had “always categorically rejected the use of forced evictions as a tool for management of World Heritage listed sites.”

“Since the Cambodian authorities announced their population relocation program in 2022, UNESCO has repeatedly and publicly recalled the importance of full respect for human rights,” he said.

Ferrer said Cambodia's response avoids addressing many of the issues raised by Amnesty, and that UNESCO — even though it says it has little ability to change national policies — has not yet used the significant leverage it does have.

“They could decide that the site is in danger, which they haven't. They can advise the World Heritage Committee, which is the ultimate body that can decide to take specific action against the state of Cambodia,” she said. “It can also conduct its own investigation and make public recommendations about what the state can be doing.”

Run Ta Ek resident Chhem Hay decided in June to take the opportunity to move from the village where she'd lived since she was a young teenager to the new settlement, enticed by the prospect of owning her own land, and a larger property than she'd ever had.

Her situation has improved since the austere early days living with her husband and teenage daughter in a tent on a dirt lot surviving on rice and prahok — a fermented fish paste that is an inexpensive staple for many Cambodians — paid for by charity handouts from Buddhist monks.

“I didn't dare eat anything much,” she said. “I tried to save money to buy bricks and sand.”

She was able to get a bank loan for $1,000 for the materials for a house, and now lives in a single-room brick structure built by her construction-worker husband and other family.

The income from the government Poor Card is enough for the monthly payments on the high-interest 2-year loan, which will have cost her almost double the principle when it's paid off. She has four chickens and some newly hatched chicks, though had to kill six others to feed the men building her house.

But the 37-year-old lost her work as a garbage collector in her village, and her husband has to drive in to Siem Reap for construction work, setting out at 5 a.m. to make it on time and spending about a third of his 35,000 riel ($8.70) daily income on gas for his motorbike.

She's looking forward to the day when the village market is opened, and hopes the government will establish a factory or similar business that will provide jobs.

“I don't know what will happen at the moment,” she said, standing in her doorway. “I'm just living day by day.”

For residents like Chhem Hay, Cambodia plans to offer vocational training, but does not envision further financial compensation, Long Kosal said.

“Once you have education, once you have a vocational skill, you can find a job easily,” he said. “Where you just remain there waiting for support, then you're not going to go anywhere. You're not going to make it.”

Meanwhile, villagers say many have already given up on Run Ta Ek, putting padlocks on their new homes and moving away — presumably back closer to Siem Reap and the Angkor site where it is easier to make a living.

Yem Srey Pin said even though Run Ta Ek has slowly improved since she arrived in February 2023, and her new home will be paid off fairly soon, she'd rather return to her village if it were possible.

But the village of Khvean is already slowly being reclaimed by the jungle, with grass growing through the foundations of houses, all that remains of the former homes. A hair curler, tattered blue playing cards and a trampled baseball cap lying on the ground are among the last vestiges of the lives left behind.

With almost all of the village's 400 families moving out, aside from a few who work at a neighboring military facility, Yem Srey Pin says there's nothing left for her there, even if APSARA would let her return.

“I can't live in my old village alone,” she said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996128678321838}",neutral,0.9996128678321838,0

Thanks to the Datalink CPDLC and ADS-C solutions, Zambia’s ATC centres and pilots will be able to communicate via data messages instead of conventional voice radio. This upgrade will enhance flight safety by mitigating the risk of degraded radio communications. VHF channels will still be available as the primary mode of communication in the Flight Information Region (FIR).

To ensure safe navigation in their airspace, air traffic control officers (ATCOs) need to know the exact position of an aircraft before and during flight. Flight plans provide an initial overview of the pilot’s intentions, but complete situational awareness is only possible thanks to a network of connected sensors that provide ATCOs with real-time knowledge. All this data enables flights to be “deconflicted”, thereby increasing air safety.

Thales TopSky – ATC is an air traffic control automation solution designed to control en route, approach and oceanic traffic, both in civil and military environments. TopSky – ATC provides air traffic controllers and technicians with innovative and intuitive access to flight information, accurate real-time tracking for faster and better decisions, efficient tools for enhanced detection and resolution of conflicts, integrated sequencing and optimisation capabilities and a robust, reliable, easy-to-maintain system.

“We would like to thank ZACL for their continued trust and are proud to be able to support them once again in improving air navigation safety by integrating two state-of-the-art functions into our TopSky – ATC system, which are perfectly suited to today’s needs. Together, Thales and ZACL are delivering the safer air travel of tomorrow, “ Cyril Einaudi, Vice President Global Turnkey segment, Thales.

Over the years, Thales has become a major player in ATM in Africa, with 80% of the continent’s control centres equipped with TopSky – ATC. This solution is used by over 16,000 controllers worldwide. More than 80 Thales ATC radars are in service in Africa today.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9996278285980225}",positive,0.9996278285980225,1

The CMA conducted an in-depth investigation and concluded that the merger would raise concerns about competition in the supply of digital mainline signalling systems, increasingly used on the UK’s major rail networks.

Railway traffic between North Korea and Russia has sharply increased

The group found that both Thales and Hitachi have strong capabilities in supplying these systems, and if the merger were to proceed, there would be few reliable competitors left.

In response to the CMA’s findings, Hitachi has offered to sell its existing mainline signalling business in the UK, France, and Germany. The group must gain approval for the buyer, and Hitachi’s key clients in these countries must also agree to the transfer of relevant signalling contracts.

The CMA considers this a proportionate and effective means of legal protection that will preserve competition and ensure that clients, such as Network Rail, are not adversely affected by the merger.

Parcels and correspondence to Ukraine by railway?

The authority states that there are no longer competition issues for the supply of communication-based train control (CBTC) signalling systems used on urban rail networks like the London Underground.

The CMA concluded that although Thales is a significant supplier to the London Underground – the only urban rail network in the UK planning new CBTC projects in the foreseeable future – Hitachi is unlikely to meet TfL’s requirements for these projects.

“We have concluded that the merger will not reduce competition in the provision of CBTC signalling systems, particularly those needed on the London Underground network. The picture is different for mainline digital signalling. To address our concerns, Hitachi is selling part of its existing mainline signalling business to an independent buyer. This will protect competition, which is crucial for cost reduction, maintaining high service quality, and fostering innovation,” said Stewart McIntosh, Head of the Independent Inquiry Group.

The acquisition of Thales Ground Transportation (GTS) is also under investigation by the European Commission.

Following an in-depth investigation, the authority has concluded that Hitachi Rail’s offer to sell part of its mainline signalling business satisfies its previous competition concerns.

© Thales

Hitachi Rail and Thales’ GTS are both global suppliers of signalling systems for mainline and urban railway networks. CMA thus previously concluded that the merger could substantially reduce competition in this field. This is because Thales and Hitachi are major competitors in the supply of these systems, and should the merger go ahead, few credible competitors would remain.

In response to these concerns, Hitachi has offered to sell its existing mainline signalling business in the United Kingdom, France and Germany.

CMA considers this to be an effective and proportionate solution that will preserve competition and prevent customers such as Network Rail from being negatively affected by the merger.

CMA will now need to approve the purchaser and Hitachi’s key customers will need to agree to the transfer of their relevant contracts.

In addition, based on new evidence, CMA no longer has competition concerns regarding the supply of Communications Based Train Control (CBTC) signalling systems. These systems are used on urban networks such as the London Underground, which is the only rail network in Great Britain that plans to carry out new CBTC projects in the foreseeable future.

Thales is currently a key supplier for this network. However, CMA has now concluded that Hitachi would have been unable to act as a competitor for these projects due to Transport for London’s (TfL) complex requirements. It believes that Hitachi is unlikely to have attained the required experience prior to the next major TfL signalling tenders.

Stuart McIntosh, Chair of the Independent Inquiry Group, said: “Effective signalling is vital for safe and reliable rail travel, which is why it has been important for us to review this merger thoroughly before reaching a final decision. We have concluded that the merger will not reduce competition to provide CBTC signalling systems, and in particular those required on the underground network in London. “The picture is not the same for digital mainline signalling. To address our concerns here, Hitachi is selling part of its existing mainline signalling business to an independent purchaser. This will protect competition, which is key to keeping costs down, maintaining high quality of service and promoting innovation.”

With this clearance from the CMA, Hitachi and Thales have now received regulatory approvals in 12 of the 13 required jurisdictions.

It has recently refiled its merger notification with the European Commission and now anticipates a final anti-trust decision on the proposed acquisition by early November.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.983606219291687}",neutral,0.983606219291687,0

The two ministers signed off on the sale of three Thales-made GM 200 radars, which France has also provided to Ukraine, and signed a memorandum of understanding on the future delivery of France's Mistral short-range air defense system.

France will also help Armenia train ground defense forces and support the country's efforts to reform and modernize its military, Lecornu said.

""We stand by our defense relationship (with Armenia), even though we're not part of the same military and political alliances. It is based on the simple principle that you need to be able to defend yourself,"" Lecornu said.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.6717845797538757}",positive,0.6717845797538757,1

In a significant win for Australia’s sovereign cyber capability, this acquisition also reflects Thales’s tremendous growth in its international cyber footprint, one of its most dynamic areas of development.

Thales announced its proposed acquisition of Tesserent in June this year. With a 2022 turnover of A$185 million (circa €110 million) and ~500 employees across 9 offices, Tesserent is a leading player in cybersecurity in Australia, providing a full suite of cybersecurity solutions and services to medium and enterprise-level organisations.

The combination of Thales and Tesserent in Australia and New Zealand will significantly strengthen the critical sovereign cyber capabilities for some of Australia and New Zealand’s most sensitive defence programs and critical infrastructure operators, whilst also contributing to the global strengthening of Thales in the cybersecurity sector.

Jeff Connolly, CEO Thales Australia and New Zealand said, “We’ve seen the significant pipeline of cyber-security work coming in Australia, and it makes sense as a provider of sovereign solutions to scale up in cyber security. The marriage of Thales and Tesserent creates a sovereign cyber security provider like no other because it links Thales as a trusted partner with Government with Tesserent’s outstanding capability in cyber, especially in the defence, security and critical infrastructure sectors. We will be very well positioned to help Government achieve its ambition of Australia being one of the most cyber-secure countries by 2030.”

Pierre-Yves Jolivet, Vice-President, Cyber Defense Solutions, Thales said, “As part of Thales’ development strategy on one of its core businesses – cybersecurity – the Group is further anchoring its managed services expertise locally through the acquisition of Tesserent, while promoting the sharing of know-how and common solutions that will benefit all Thales cyber teams worldwide. We are proud that Thales cyber solutions, guided by the sovereign interest of States, are helping build a more resilient world.”

With the closing of the Tesserent acquisition and Thales’s agreement to acquire Imperva, a leading US-based data and application cybersecurity company announced in July 2023, Thales is taking its cybersecurity business to the next level, with more than € 2.4 billion revenue from cybersecurity expected in 2024.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999966621398926}",positive,0.9999966621398926,1

Iridium approves third Certus 700 satcom for aero; says more to come - Runway Girl Network,"Mon, 30 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjMvMTAvaXJpZGl1bS1hcHByb3Zlcy10aGlyZC1jZXJ0dXMtNzAwLXNhdGNvbS1mb3ItYWVyby1zYXlzLW1vcmUtdG8tY29tZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Skytrac’s Iridium Certus SDL-350 satcom system has gained official Iridium approval to provide connectivity across all segments of aviation, including fixed-wing, rotorcraft, and advanced air mobility platforms. This milestone brings to three the number of approved Certus 700 satcom units available for cockpit and cabin connectivity, with more to come, Iridium confirms.

In addition to the Skytrac SDL-350, Iridium has already approved Honeywell’s Aspire 350 and Collins Aerospace’s IRT NX satcom. These are the L-band Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite operator’s certified Iridium Certus 700 systems for aviation, which are capable of supporting speeds of up to 704 Kbps.

“We have more to come next year,” Iridium executive director aviation line of business, John Peterson, tells Runway Girl Network. “It is an exciting time!”

It is not immediately clear to RGN if Thales will deliver a Certus satcom unit for aero next year. Before the Covid pandemic, Thales had been building a single-satcom ‘FlytLINK’ terminal for Certus in aero, and intended to be first to market with a Certus aviation product. The French multinational corporation was also working to support cockpit comms on the Boeing 777X programme, though its FlytLINK hardware was to be branded by Honeywell for Honeywell’s Aspire product line for the 777X cockpit.

In the midst of the pandemic, when Thales initiated layoffs in Florida and California, RGN started receiving messages from readers suggesting that Boeing and Honeywell were no longer working with Thales on the programme, and that some of the Melbourne, Florida layoffs were related to this change. Thales did not comment, but a Honeywell executive told RGN at the time that Honeywell would provide a “Honeywell satcom” terminal that operates on Iridium’s network for the 777X programme.

“Since Honeywell has its own Iridium Certus connected terminal now (Aspire 350), that makes sense,” Iridium’s Peterson tells RGN. Neither Iridium nor Thales has as yet clarified to RGN if a Thales Certus 700 unit for aero is still forthcoming.

Skytrac’s newly approved SDL-350, meanwhile, enables various mission services, including but not limited to crew and cabin connectivity, flight data monitoring, real-time video downlinking, Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) communications, VoIP and more.

Carson Air, a leading provider of fixed-wing air ambulance services in British Columbia, has already elected the Skytrac SDL-350 system for its fleet of King Air 360 turboprops.

“The system will enable powerful capabilities to improve pilot situational awareness while also aiding flight paramedics to provide better care through liaising with medical professionals via inflight internet, video conferencing, and voice communications. The integration of the SDL-350 will be conducted by special mission integrator and interior modifications firm, HeliMods,” explains Skytrac in reference to the Carson Air project.

Skytrac’s roadmap for the SDL-350 includes enabling safety services in time. That’s because Certus is expected to get the green light to support FANS-1A safety services in the cockpit following flight trials, and approvals in 2024.

Iridium Certus will compete with Inmarsat-now-Viasat’s L-band-supported safety services, adding welcome competition to the aviation market.

Separately, Iridium is working with other players in aero on a variety of applications. Netherlands-based AirFi, for example, will support messaging and real-time credit card transactions via its AirFi LEO connected wireless IFE units, using the low-bandwidth Certus 100 service. Narrowbody and widebody operators are gravitating to the AirFi LEO offering.

But other IFE stakeholders are also eyeing similar connected entertainment solutions now that a growing number of Certus boxes are being approved.

“There are other players looking for low-cost solutions to handle credit card processing and text on Iridium’s network. It’s a very exciting and cool use case, although due to agreement terms we are not yet able to comment on who they are,” says Peterson.

DPM Heng Swee Keat at Thales Singapore's 50th Anniversary Gala Dinner - Prime Minister's Office Singapore,"Thu, 05 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBtby5nb3Yuc2cvTmV3c3Jvb20vRFBNLUhlbmctU3dlZS1LZWF0LWF0LVRoYWxlcy1TaW5nYXBvcmVzLTUwdGgtQW5uaXZlcnNhcnktR2FsYS1EaW5uZXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Mr. Patrice Caine, Chairman and CEO of Thales,

Ambassador Minh-di Tang,

SMS Amy Khor

Ladies and gentlemen,



I am delighted to join you this evening to celebrate Thales’ 50th anniversary in Singapore.

Singapore and Thales have a longstanding partnership that has deepened over the decades.

When Thales began operations here in 1973, we were still operating out of Paya Lebar Airport. Thales’ avionics operations supported airlines in region, including Singapore Airlines.

Today, Changi Airport is one of the world’s top 10 busiest international airports, while Thales’ footprint in Singapore has grown significantly.

Singapore is home to some 2,000 Thales employees across regional headquarters, innovation and manufacturing activities.

Thales’ technology is also present in our day-to-day lives.

Our commuters pass through the contactless fare gates made by Thales on the North-South, East-West, and Circle Lines.

The safe and efficient management of flights into and out of our busy Changi Airport is enabled by Thales’ air traffic management systems, which have been used by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) since the 1990s.

And as Patrice mentioned, Singapore is Thales’ Centre of Excellence for avionics manufacturing, and the largest centre for avionic maintenance.

The banking cards that most of us use are produced out of Singapore, which is the largest and only multi-product manufacturing site for Thales’ Digital Identity and Security business globally.

Singapore’s partnership with Thales is built on strong mutual trust and a shared long-term view. We value this partnership greatly. Now today, we are facing a more challenging and uncertain global environment.

Besides high interest rates, inflation, and energy prices, we are observing more structural shifts such as the fragmentation of supply chains and growing protectionism, underpinned by geopolitical tensions.

The operating environment for companies is now more complex, as they have to balance different considerations carefully, and navigate a more fraught landscape.

Against this backdrop, Singapore strives to strengthen our fundamentals in three ways, so that we can continue to bring value to, and create value with our partners.

Openness and connections

Firstly, we must remain open and strengthen our connections with international partners.

Our relations with France is a good example how we have continuously strengthened ties across the political, defence, business, cultural and scientific domains.

Besides the frequent exchange of high-level visits and political interactions, our economic ties are also robust.

Today, there are over 2,500 French companies registered in Singapore, spanning from aerospace to finance to consumer goods.

We have expanded cooperation into new growth areas.

Last year, we signed the France-Singapore Digital and Green Partnership to forge closer collaborations in digital and green growth.

At the same time, we are finding new ways to deepen cooperation in established domains.

The Singapore and France Advanced Research Initiative (or SAFARI) has enabled defence technology and research collaborations since 1997.

In April 2023, the Singapore Ministry of Defence and France’s Ministry of the Armed Forces agreed to establish a Joint Lab – the first such initiative that MINDEF has established with an overseas country and partner.

Science, technology, and innovation

This brings me to my second point – we must continue to invest in science, technology, and innovation.

As a city-state without natural resources, Singapore anchors our competitiveness through research, innovation, and enterprise (RIE).

We invest around 1% of our GDP and our agencies, universities and research institutes work with companies and partners to strengthen our RIE ecosystem for mutual benefit.

In this regard, our partnership with France is robust and longstanding.

French research institutes, such as CNRS, have an established presence in Singapore. In fact, CNRS’ first foreign subsidiary is its campus at our Campus for Research and Technological Enterprise (or CREATE).

Stemming from the France-Singapore Year of Innovation in 2018, we have deepened scientific and innovation collaboration in areas such as Circular Economy, Artificial Intelligence and Quantum.

I look forward to hosting Higher Education, Research and Innovation Minister Sylvie Retailleau when she visits Singapore for the Joint Committee on Science and Innovation in a few weeks’ time.

Public-private partnerships play an important role in advancing our RIE agenda, by bringing together the best minds and capabilities across the public sector and companies. In this regard, Thales has been an exemplary partner for Singapore.

Besides your strong in-house R&D capabilities, Thales has formed close partnerships with our institutions and agencies to push the boundaries of innovation together.

The CINTRA joint lab – a collaboration between CNRS, NTU, and Thales – recently renewed its partnership for a fourth tenure.

Over the past 15 years, CINTRA has advanced nano-materials research, with a focus on application in electronics, photonics and renewable energy.

The lab has trained over 50 PhDs to date, including two Industrial Postgraduate Programme (or IPP) trainees with Thales.

Through its Digital Factory, Thales worked with SBS Transit to co-develop a digital solution for real-time passenger density insights, to enable effective crowd management at our MRT stations.

Thales also partners our public agencies in a range of areas.

As a member of A*STAR’s Singapore Aerospace Programme, Thales works with our public sector researchers on pre-competitive research topics such as material development for aircraft electrification and system development for enhanced safety.

The Thales-CAAS Aviation Innovation Research Lab (or AIR Lab) is exploring new and innovative air traffic management (ATM) solutions to enhance the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of air travel. This will facilitate Singapore’s efforts to remain at the forefront of ATM.

Thales also has a joint lab with our Home Team Science and Technology Agency (HTX), to co-innovate new technologies that enhance Singapore’s safety and security.

Talent development

This brings me to my final point. To power our ecosystem and anchor Singapore’s position as a Global-Asia node for technology, innovation and enterprise, we must continue to partner with the industry to build deep capabilities and fully develop our talent.

We want to work hand-in-hand with like-minded companies like Thales, to invest in and equip our people with the relevant skills, so that they can in turn support industry growth.

One example is Dunlin Tan. An electrical engineer by training, Dunlin first joined the CINTRA joint lab as a researcher, then completed a PhD degree under the IPP, which was supported by EDB.

Dunlin researched novel carbon nanotubes techniques for electronic packaging, while receiving guidance from Thales.

Today, Dunlin is the Director of Thales’ Research and Technology centre in Singapore, leading a team of engineers and researchers working on topics across hardware, material science and algorithms.

Another example is Lim Peng Chye. He is currently the longest-serving employee in Thales’ Digital Identity and Security manufacturing site here, with 41 years of experience!

Peng Chye started out as a Printing Assistant and is now a Senior Print Material Specialist – a role which requires attention to detail in ink mixing and colour matching of the card products.

As an experienced member of the team, he also plays a key role in imparting skills and knowledge to younger members.

The Thales examples I’ve mentioned highlight the symbiotic relationship that Singapore seeks to build with companies here.

Your commitment to developing the local workforce and capabilities, coupled with your innovative business, makes Thales an attractive employer in Singapore.

In turn, you can continue to attract the right talent, including global talent with complementary skillsets to our local workforce, to drive your work in Singapore.

Conclusion

Let me conclude. With the strong and multifaceted foundation that we have built up over the past 50 years, I echo Patrice’s confidence that our next 50 years of partnership with Thales will be even more fruitful.

I am delighted to hear Chairman Patrice Caine’s announcements on Thales’s plans to further grow your presence here in the coming years, which will create new job opportunities for our people.

The Defence Hub, the Air Traffic Management Centre of Excellence, and the Scaleflyt Remote ID will take our longstanding collaboration to the next level.

It will enable us to deepen capabilities, create exciting opportunities for our people, and contribute to Thale’s capabilities to serve existing and new customers.

I thank Thales for your continued expansion in Singapore, and offer my warmest congratulations on your 50th anniversary. Let us deepen our partnership, and continue to break new ground together.

Thank you.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7114812135696411}",positive,0.7114812135696411,1

The EC’s approval means that the deal has now received clearance from all 13 competition authorities which reviewed the acquisition. As a condition of securing approval for the acquisition in Britain and the European Union (EU), Hitachi Rail has agreed to divest its mainline signalling businesses in France, Germany and Britain.

The EC says its investigation showed that the transaction would have reduced competition and led to higher prices and less innovation in the markets for mainline signalling projects, including overlay and resignalling projects in both Germany and France as well as interlocking projects in France.

To address the commission's concerns, Hitachi Rail offered to divest its mainline signalling platforms in both countries, including international locations, which fully addressed the EC’s concerns. This will also preserve competition by removing the horizontal overlap between the parties in the French and German markets for interlockings and automatic train protection (ATO) wayside systems for mainline signalling.

The EC says the commitments made by Hitachi will enable the purchasers of the divested businesses to run them as a viable competitive force in the market on a lasting basis. The commission will closely monitor the divestment process, including approving the purchasers of the divested businesses.

Following positive feedback from market testing, the commission concluded that the modified transaction would no longer raise competition concerns.

Hitachi Rail has also committed to divest its mainline signalling business in Britain following concerns raised by Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The CMA then gave its approval for the deal on October 4.

Hitachi Rail announced the acquisition of Thales GTS in August 2021. The transaction was first notified to the commission on October 4 2022, but the parties withdrew their notification on November 3 2022 in view of the competition concerns identified by the EC. The parties renotified the transaction to the commission on September 14 2023.

Hitachi previously strengthened its mainline and urban rail signalling capabilities with the acquisition of Italy’s Ansaldo STS, which was completed in January 2019.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9384104013442993}",neutral,0.9384104013442993,0

"Thales acquires Tesserent, boosting ANZ cyber sovereignty - IT Brief Australia","Mon, 09 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vaXRicmllZi5jb20uYXUvc3RvcnkvdGhhbGVzLWFjcXVpcmVzLXRlc3NlcmVudC1ib29zdGluZy1hbnotY3liZXItc292ZXJlaWdudHnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales has successfully completed the acquisition of Tesserent, marking a significant milestone in expanding its international cyber footprint. Tesserent, one of the foremost cybersecurity companies in Australia and New Zealand, secured approval from its shareholders and met all necessary regulatory requirements for the acquisition to proceed.

Earlier this year, in June, Thales had announced its intent to acquire Tesserent. With an impressive turnover of A$185 million (circa €110 million) in 2022 and a strong workforce of approximately 500 employees spread across nine offices, Tesserent is undeniably a dominant force in the cybersecurity landscape of Australia. Catering predominantly to medium and enterprise-level organisations, they offer a comprehensive range of cybersecurity solutions and services.

This collaboration between Thales and Tesserent is poised to considerably enhance the sovereign cyber capabilities vital for some of Australia and New Zealand's most sensitive defence initiatives and critical infrastructure operations. Furthermore, it augments Thales's global prominence in the cybersecurity sector.

Jeff Connolly, CEO of Thales Australia and New Zealand, expressed his optimism regarding the acquisition, stating, “We’ve seen the significant pipeline of cyber-security work coming in Australia, and it makes sense as a provider of sovereign solutions to scale up in cyber security.”

Connolly further elucidated on the synergies expected from the acquisition: “The marriage of Thales and Tesserent creates a sovereign cyber security provider like no other because it links Thales as a trusted partner with Government with Tesserent’s outstanding capability in cyber, especially in the defence, security and critical infrastructure sectors. We will be very well positioned to help Government achieve its ambition of Australia being one of the most cyber-secure countries by 2030.”

From the perspective of Thales's broader developmental strategies, this acquisition plays a pivotal role. Pierre-Yves Jolivet, Vice-President of Cyber Defense Solutions at Thales, remarked, “As part of Thales' development strategy on one of its core businesses – cybersecurity – the Group is further anchoring its managed services expertise locally through the acquisition of Tesserent.” Jolivet also highlighted the larger global vision, adding, “while promoting the sharing of know-how and common solutions that will benefit all Thales cyber teams worldwide. We are proud that Thales cyber solutions, guided by the sovereign interest of States, are helping build a more resilient world.”

The acquisition of Tesserent is just one of the many strategic moves Thales has been making in recent times. In July 2023, Thales announced its agreement to acquire Imperva, a leading US-based data and application cybersecurity firm. With these acquisitions under its belt, Thales is setting the stage for an exponential growth in its cybersecurity business. As per current projections, the company anticipates generating more than € 2.4 billion revenue from its cybersecurity segment by 2024.

The acquisition heralds an era where the combined capabilities of Thales and Tesserent will fortify the cybersecurity infrastructure in Australia and New Zealand, while also contributing significantly to Thales's global cyber initiatives.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.999997615814209}",positive,0.999997615814209,1
SEA 1905 – and then there were two - APDR - Asia Pacific Defence Reporter,"Sun, 08 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vYXNpYXBhY2lmaWNkZWZlbmNlcmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tL3NlYS0xOTA1LWFuZC10aGVuLXRoZXJlLXdlcmUtdHdvL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The long-delayed SEA 1905 mine countermeasures and sea survey program is a step closer to achieving an outcome with the shortlisting of Saab Australia and Exail. While not officially confirmed to APDR, it seems clear that the loser is Thales, who have been unexpectedly dropped. It will probably take Defence another 12 months to select a preferred bidder.

The decision is a little surprising because in industry circles the offers from Saab and Thales were considered the ones most likely to get up. This is no reflection on Exail, just that the other two are well established in Australia and both have a proven track record of delivering systems and services to the RAN.

While Exail are strong in Europe – especially France – they are less well known here. The company was created in 2022 through the merger of iXblue with the ECA Group. Both companies have a history in underwater robotics, navigation and survey. Exail has around 1,500 employees and a turnover of $400 million.

It is a bit too early to speculate on why Thales Australia were eliminated. Created in the 1980s to deliver the ‘Scylla’ sonar suite on the Collins submarines they went on to expand their activities by also providing the underwater warfare system on the Anzac frigates. For a couple of decades, they were the dominant force in Australian naval underwater technology, sometimes to the discomfort of smaller industry players.

This decision will undoubtedly hurt the company, particularly as it follows hard on the heels of the unannounced Defence decision to spend $310 million on a fully imported US towed array system called SURTASS. APDR has called this decision scandalous – a view apparently shared by the entire Australian underwater technology sector, which has the capacity to do the work locally.

It could be that Thales were underbid. Or it could be that Defence took the view that there was some technical overlap between the bids from Saab and Thales, meaning that eliminating one of them made sense. Whatever the reasons, they are unlikely to be ever shared with the public.

This initiative stems from the Strategic Cooperation Agreement inked in 2022 between Thales, PGZ, and PGZ SW, ensuring the PGZ-MIECZNIK Consortium equips the frigates with multifaceted capabilities.

Slated to be operational by 2029, the first MIECZNIK Frigate will showcase the TACTICOS system's prowess in areas like detection, identification, and decision-making.

This strategic alliance between Thales and PGZ-MIECZNIK Consortium—headed by Polska Grupa Zbrojeniowa—aims to enhance the Polish Navy's operational reach.

The MIECZNIK class frigates, tailored to perform a broad spectrum of maritime tasks, will play a pivotal role in safeguarding sea lines of communication and crucial infrastructure.

They displace 7,000 tons and measure 138.7 meters in length. When it comes to speed, they can exceed 28 knots, which is approximately 52 km/h or 32 mph.

As a potent force multiplier for the Polish Navy, these vessels will feature Thales' sensor suite seamlessly interfaced with the frigate's combat mechanisms.

TACTICOS, Thales' flagship combat management system, will serve as the frigate's central nerve, orchestrating tasks like sensor management, situation evaluation, and weapon control, ensuring optimal naval efficiency.

The frigates will also house Thales' comprehensive sonar portfolio, including the BlueHunter hull-mounted sonar and the Captas-2 towed-array sonar. The onboard SM400 Block 2 and NS50 radars, accompanied by the TSA 6000 IFF1 interrogator, will deliver unparalleled air and surface surveillance and tracking. Moreover, the vessels will be armed with ARTEMIS—a panoramic naval infrared search system—and the STIR 1.2 EO Mk2 fire control radar.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9991705417633057}",neutral,0.9991705417633057,0

This investment is a vote of confidence in the capability of Australian industry to support the Government’s objectives to build this important sovereign capability right here in Australia.

Minister for Defence Industry Pat Conroy said, “The Albanese government’s investment in these cutting-edge technologies demonstrates we are delivering on the Defence Strategic Review’s recommendations to develop advanced munitions manufacturing in Australia. The Mulwala and Benalla munition factories underpin Australia’s ability to develop critical propellants, explosives and munitions for the Australian Defence Force.”

For more than 25 years, Thales has supported the Australian Defence Force (ADF) and strategic partners with core industrial capabilities for munitions and ordnance manufacture, and guided weapons production including the manufacture of high-performance propellants and explosives for warheads, solid fuel rocket motor manufacturing and associated R&D and support services.

Thales Australia and New Zealand CEO Jeff Connolly said, “I welcome the government and Minister Conroy’s announcement to invest in this critical capability will support the significant step-change in technology development and innovation necessary to continue to grow a highly skilled workforce and create the advanced manufacturing jobs of the future.”

In 2021 Thales Australia invested $6million in new state-of-the-art advanced manufacturing equipment at the Commonwealth owned Mulwala facility in regional New South Wales, to rapidly accelerate sovereign guided weapons manufacturing capability.

The company’s investment in new large-scale preparation and mixing equipment will enable a 500% increase in the size of rocket motors able to be manufactured at Mulwala, supporting production of advanced guided weapons and hypersonic weapons.

“Thales’s investment in increasing Australia’s industrial capability is a clear demonstration of the company’s long-term commitment to growing and maintaining an enduring, sustainable and resilient sovereign industrial munitions capability, and be an indispensable partner to the Australian Defence Force in delivering them a strategic sovereign capability advantage,” said Connolly.

Thales Australia is the nation’s largest manufacturer of munitions, propellant and military explosives and manages the government owned contractor operated (GOCO) sites in Benalla, Victoria and Mulwala, New South Wales employing over 650 skilled staff to manufacture munitions systems for the ADF and allied forces.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9771277904510498}",positive,0.9771277904510498,1
Thales to modernise Zambia's air traffic control with latest TopSky ATC solution - Liberia news The New Dawn Liberia ... - The New Dawn Liberia,"Tue, 10 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlbmV3ZGF3bmxpYmVyaWEuY29tL3RoYWxlcy10by1tb2Rlcm5pc2UtemFtYmlhcy1haXItdHJhZmZpYy1jb250cm9sLXdpdGgtbGF0ZXN0LXRvcHNreS1hdGMtc29sdXRpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Following the contract signed in 2014 with Zambia Airports Corporation Limited (ZACL), Thales is modernising the ATC (air traffic control) centres at Lusaka and Livingstone international airports in Zambia.

Thales is expanding its TopSky – ATC air traffic control automation solution with two new applications. The first is Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC), which allows clear and secure dialogue between pilots and controllers. The second is Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Contract (ADS-C), which automatically transmits aircraft flight status reports to ATM systems on the ground.

LUSAKA, Zambia, 10 October 2023 -/African Media Agency(AMA)/- Thales is working with Zambia Airports Corporation Limited to modernise the TopSky – ATC systems at the ATC centres at Kenneth Kaunda International Airport, Lusaka and Harry Mwanga Nkumbula International Airport, Livingstone. Thanks to the Datalink CPDLC and ADS-C solutions, Zambia’s ATC centres and pilots will be able to communicate via data messages instead of conventional voice radio. This upgrade will enhance flight safety by mitigating the risk of degraded radio communications. VHF channels will still be available as the primary mode of communication in the Flight Information Region (FIR).

To ensure safe navigation in their airspace, air traffic control officers (ATCOs) need to know the exact position of an aircraft before and during flight. Flight plans provide an initial overview of the pilot’s intentions, but complete situational awareness is only possible thanks to a network of connected sensors that provide ATCOs with real-time knowledge. All this data enables flights to be “deconflicted”, thereby increasing air safety.

Thales TopSky – ATC is an air traffic control automation solution designed to control en route, approach and oceanic traffic, both in civil and military environments. TopSky – ATC provides air traffic controllers and technicians with innovative and intuitive access to flight information, accurate real-time tracking for faster and better decisions, efficient tools for enhanced detection and resolution of conflicts, integrated sequencing and optimisation capabilities and a robust, reliable, easy-to-maintain system.

“We would like to thank ZACL for their continued trust and are proud to be able to support them once again in improving air navigation safety by integrating two state-of-the-art functions into our TopSky – ATC system, which are perfectly suited to today’s needs. Together, Thales and ZACL are delivering the safer air travel of tomorrow, “Cyril Einaudi, Vice President Global Turnkey segment, Thales.

Over the years, Thales has become a major player in ATM in Africa, with 80% of the continent’s control centres equipped with TopSky – ATC. This solution is used by over 16,000 controllers worldwide. More than 80 Thales ATC radars are in service in Africa today.

T-90M's thermal camera matrix is Russian-made under French license - Bulgarian Military,"Fri, 06 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vYnVsZ2FyaWFubWlsaXRhcnkuY29tLzIwMjMvMTAvMDYvdC05MG1zLXRoZXJtYWwtY2FtZXJhLW1hdHJpeC1pcy1ydXNzaWFuLW1hZGUtdW5kZXItZnJlbmNoLWxpY2Vuc2Uv0gFraHR0cHM6Ly9idWxnYXJpYW5taWxpdGFyeS5jb20vMjAyMy8xMC8wNi90LTkwbXMtdGhlcm1hbC1jYW1lcmEtbWF0cml4LWlzLXJ1c3NpYW4tbWFkZS11bmRlci1mcmVuY2gtbGljZW5zZS8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An interesting video appeared a few days ago. It was informational and featured the Russian T-90M Proryv tank. Observant users noticed the wording Thales on the fire control system. Accordingly, various speculations began.

One of them is that the Russian tank is equipped with a thermal imaging matrix produced by the French company Thales. Comments and speculations began that France was supplying Russia with its thermal imaging matrices. Others have suggested that Russia once bought such dies from France and quite possibly has them in stock.

However, there is a third possibility that is supported by facts. BulgarianMilitary.com does not claim this possibility to eliminate the other two, but for the sake of argument and objectivity, it should be exposed to the public.

2nd generation Catherine-FC

The T-90M Proryv was introduced in 2012. One of the main features of the tank was the fire control system [fire control system] called Kalina, which included the Sosna-U sight and the Hawk’s Eye panoramic sight.

Both sights are based on French 2nd generation Catherine-FC thermal imaging matrices operating in the 8-12 micron range. The fact is that these matrices were not delivered en masse to the Russian Federation, but were produced. The production was carried out under the license of NPO Orion for AD VOMZ with 80% localization. Only the control unit was supplied from France and was not manufactured in Russia.

There is one more fact: since 2015, Russia has been the 4th country to master the production of its own thermal imaging matrices of the 2nd and 3rd generation. The claim that Russia has run out of thermal imaging sights due to economic sanctions is also exaggerated.

Quantitative production

When thermal imaging matrices are produced, they are not produced for a specific number of military equipment, but quantitatively for an entire military domain. For example – ground combat vehicles. I.e. Russia has produced thermal imaging arrays for both its tanks and APCs, MTLBs, self-propelled howitzers, and other infantry fighting vehicles.

There have also been claims that Russia has a shortage of tube components that is preventing sight assembly. This information is also contradictory because Russia has a problem, not with tribal components, but with FPGA chips. Russia just didn’t produce FPGA chips before, so they had to be bought from Xilinx and others.

But they were not made until 2020 – now the situation is different. For example, the new Russian FPGA chips of the 5578TS084, 5578TS094, 5576ХС1Т series can replace imported counterparts, and in fact, according to sources, this has already happened precisely because of the imposed economic sanctions against Russia.

For example, the R-168-25UE radios have an internal FPGA and ADC from JSC VZPP-S, which means that the situation is similar in the sight control units. In the latest photos of the T-90M 2022, it can be seen inside that there is no Sosna-U sight, it has been replaced by a PNM-T sight with a homemade Irbis-K thermal imaging module from NPO Orion, as in fact the PK PAN Hawkeye sight.

Comparison

How good Russian thermal imaging matrices are compared to French – this is a comparison that is difficult to make because it depends on many factors. But let’s present a comparative technological characteristic between the Russian matrix PNM-T and the French Catherine-FC.

Catherine-FC has two fields of view, a range of 8-12 microns [LWIR technology], matrix resolution is 754×576 pixels, detection of infantry at a distance of up to 6 km, armored vehicles at up to 10 km, helicopters at 14 km.

The Russian PNM-T has two fields of view, a range of 8-12 microns, a resolution of 640×512 pixels, detection of infantry at a distance of 5 km, armored vehicles at 11 km, and helicopters at 14 km.

T-14 Armata

As you can see, the resolution of the Russian matrix is lower, but the picture is more detailed since the processor has more advanced DSP and image processing algorithms. In addition, the picture from the Russian thermal camera is more contrasty and does not have strong interference when the environment is very hot, which means that the T-90M and T-72B3 can see perfectly both day and night.

Russian 3rd generation thermal imaging matrices with a sensor substrate made based on gallium arsenide [GaAs] from NPO Orion are said to have a resolution of 800×600 pixels with uncompressed interpolation up to 1024×720 pixels. Such thermal imaging cameras are installed on the T-14 Armata, but their picture is on a completely different level.

France announces sale of weapons to Armenia - Le Monde,"Mon, 23 Oct 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlbW9uZGUuZnIvZW4vaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjMvMTAvMjMvZnJhbmNlLWFubm91bmNlcy1zYWxlLW9mLWRlZmVuc2l2ZS13ZWFwb25zLXRvLWFybWVuaWFfNjE5NzAxM180Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"France announced Monday, October 23, the sale of defensive equipment to Armenia as Azerbaijan launched military drills with its ally Turkey. The deal was announced weeks after Baku seized Nagorno-Karabakh from Armenian separatists and amid fears in Yerevan that Azerbaijan might now seek to target southern Armenia.

Speaking to reporters, French Defense Minister Sébastien Lecornu said Armenia would buy three Ground Master 200 (GM200) radar systems from the French defense group Thales, without providing financial details. The system, already used in Ukraine, is known for its ""remarkable detection capabilities,"" Lecornu said at a press conference alongside Armenian Defense Minister Suren Papikyan.

The ministers also signed a letter of intent for Armenia's purchase of air defense systems involving Thales and European missile maker MBDA, a spokesperson for Lecornu told AFP. Lecornu said the letter of intent involved the purchase of ""Mistral-type"" equipment, referring to a short-range air defense missile system.

""Detection only makes sense if it is accompanied by intervention and interception modules for attacks coming from the sky,"" Lecornu said. ""It is the Armenian ministry which is purchasing these weapons and which will be subject to export licenses,"" he added.

He insisted that the weapons were defensive in nature. ""It is a weapon system which, by its very nature, can only be implemented when there is an aggression on Armenian territory and often with civilian populations underneath,"" Lecornu said.

Armenia also signed a contract to buy night-vision goggles from the French group Safran, the defense ministry spokesperson said. In a statement, the Armenian defense ministry said that the ministers discussed defense and that the two countries later signed documents relating to ""bilateral cooperation.""

In early October, French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna said on a visit to Armenia that Paris had agreed to deliver military equipment to the small South Caucasus nation. After that announcement, Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev refused to meet with Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan for talks in Spain.

Azerbaijan slammed what it called France's policy of ""militarisation"" in the South Caucasus. France, which has a large Armenian diaspora, has helped mediate a decades-old territorial dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

Earlier Monday, Azerbaijan said it had begun joint military drills with its ally Turkey near the border with Armenia.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999908208847046}",neutral,0.9999908208847046,0
