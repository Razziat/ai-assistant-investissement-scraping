Key points

Thales unveils the revolutionary STAR NG next generation radar system for air traffic control.

The radar includes a host of new technologies including full dual civil/military capabilities

The technological breakthroughs included in the radar make it the most advanced, and efficient radar surveillance system in the world

STAR NG is an S-Band Primary Surveillance Radar (PSR) which can perform all the operational primary surveillance requirements of both civil and military air traffic control.

The technological breakthroughs developed for the STAR NG allow the radar to address some of the key challenges of the industry. Most notably the system provides increased mitigation of windfarms, as well drastically reducing the impact on operational performance caused by the noise of 4G networks.

STAR NG is ideally suited to the specific needs of dual military civilian applications, as it has a spectrum of military capabilities no civilian radar possesses, namely, the ability to detect both slow and fast moving targets such as helicopters and fighters as well as very small targets such as UAVs. It also possesses anti-jamming functions, and has the ability to provide altimetry information.

The development of STAR NG makes it unparalleled in the market. It has the most efficient detection range in the world for its power output as well as the best resolution and capacity to detect a target in a clutter environment.

Because of its new generation technology, STAR NG also makes a better use of materials and energy as the most compact solution in the world, with the lowest energy consumption.

Launch of U.S.-French oceanography satellite postponed – Spaceflight Now - Spaceflight Now,"Tue, 02 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VmbGlnaHRub3cuY29tLzIwMTUvMDYvMDIvbGF1bmNoLW9mLXUtcy1mcmVuY2gtb2NlYW5vZ3JhcGh5LXNhdGVsbGl0ZS1wb3N0cG9uZWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The launch of a U.S.-French oceanography satellite from California has been postponed from July 22 after engineers discovered contamination in one of the spacecraft’s thrusters at its factory in France.

NOAA announced the launch slip Tuesday. Officials did not set a new launch date.

“The launch of the Jason 3 mission will not occur July 22, as announced previously,” NOAA said in a statement. “During spacecraft testing, engineers located contamination in one of the four thrusters on the spacecraft. The problem thruster has been replaced. An investigation into the contamination will continue during the next two weeks, as the new thruster is tested.”

The Jason 3 ocean research platform was preparing for shipment from France to its launch site at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on June 9. Technicians planned to complete final testing on the spacecraft and fuel the satellite with in-orbit maneuvering propellant ahead of liftoff on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.

NOAA said a new launch date would be set based on the outcome of the thruster review.

The Jason 3 satellite is undergoing final checks at its Thales Alenia Space factory in Cannes, France.

With a full load of fuel, Jason 3 will weight about 1,124 pounds at launch. SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket will deploy the satellite into orbit 830 miles above Earth for a five-year mission.

Jason 3 will extend space-based measurements of sea levels and wave height begun in 1992. It is the fourth satellite in a series of U.S.-French missions dedicated to collecting ocean topography data.

The new mission will replace the Jason 2 satellite launched in 2008.

Scientists will use Jason 3’s oceanography measurements to monitor global sea level rise and help predict hurricanes, wave heights and tides. Jason 3 will also contribute to oil spill response, marine biology research and El Nino and La Nina forecasting, according to NOAA.

Valued at more than $350 million, Jason 3 is a joint project between NOAA and Eumetsat, operator of U.S. and European weather satellites. The French space agency CNES paid for Jason 3’s satellite platform, and NASA managed procurement of instruments and the Falcon 9 launch vehicle on behalf of NOAA.

The big three avionics manufacturers—Honeywell, Rockwell Collins and Thales—are quietly preparing the flight decks of tomorrow’s airliners, making the most of recent progress in the understanding of the human brain. Some major improvements are coming from the business aviation world, where missions are often more complex and the flight plan can be changed in flight. These innovations include the front-panel touchscreen, the head-up display (HUD) and the active sidestick.

Thales’ demonstrator focuses on pilot anticipation

Thales already has a demonstrator. The entirely new human-machine interface is dubbed Avionics 2020. Based on a set of large touchscreens, it is being designed to offer more intuitive interaction. It therefore aims at better situational awareness and easier decision-making.

It is scalable to any type of aircraft, including helicopters, according to Thales. On the airliner layout, four displays are located on the front panel and the other two are on the pedestal. An Avionics 2020-based flight deck could enter into service early in the next decade, as its name suggests.

“Current cockpit architecture is fast reaching the limit of the amount of systems that can be efficiently operated by pilots. The next generation of cockpit will require a different approach,” according to information prepared by Thales. Avionics 2020 is the result of a number of partnerships spearheaded by Thales and involves in-depth research into the understanding of the interface. The demonstrator follows the principles of “natural and direct hands-on interaction,” as Thales’ experts put it.

Avionics 2020 helps pilots “capitalize on their strengths and manage their weaknesses.” Decision-making is therefore “instinctive and less reliant on cognitive analysis.” Thales’ experts explain that this mimics the process the human brain goes through to make a decision, especially under stress. In practice, touchscreens make it more straightforward to prepare a flight or to change destination after departure.

One design driver is helping the pilot to anticipate the next stage of the flight. This can be done via the “timeline,” a graphic depiction of the trip’s successive events. On the timeline, the pilot can zoom in and see the upcoming changes—waypoints, altitude, aircraft configuration, etc.

The new flight deck is supposed to give the pilot a clear image of the actions he or she chooses to delegate. When assigning the autopilot to capture a heading, the pursued heading will be shown in blue on the main display. This also helps answer the question, “What is the system doing and what is it going to do next?”

The third design driver has been schematization. The idea is to avoid excessively complex views of the systems. When a problem arises, the pilot will first be given a broad picture to show them where the issue is on the aircraft. Then, he or she can—by a single touch input—enter a more detailed level of representation.The fourth design driver has been to make learning curves as swift as possible. A new interaction must quickly become a routine, thus freeing up the pilot’s mind. Thales engineers have copied everyday life protocols, such as the pinch-to-zoom gesture. An easy method is considered preferable in a stress situation.

This also translates into straightforward actions and views. When selecting an airport on the moving map, the pilot can add the radio frequency to the related list on the communications display. The pilot will see the radio frequency sliding through the displays, from the map to its position on the list. This not only looks nice—it uses cognitive continuity which, Thales experts say, is a very powerful way to save mental resources.

Intuitiveness can also be found with throttle positions. The “eco climb” position is displayed above the horizon line and the “climb” position even higher, while the “idle” position is displayed below the horizon. This gives an immediate depiction of the consequence of moving the throttle.

Moreover, as an input, these throttle positions can be seen on the left part of the screen. Meanwhile, the output—the vertical speed—is shown on the right part. This layout makes the relationship between the input and the output obvious.

From a technology standpoint, Thales claims to have brought cockpit touchscreens to an “iPhone-like” user experience. For instance, the pilot can drag and drop an object continuously through flush displays. “A cockpit designed around more seamless interaction between the pilot and the electronics is no longer a purely intellectual concept, but a viable commercial application,” said Denis Bonnet, head of innovation for Thales’ cockpit competence centre.

Heads up

On Avionics 2020, bi-chromal HUDs are available, too. The second colour—red, in addition to the conventional green—could help with alert messages. Generally speaking, HUDs are relatively new to commercial passenger aircraft. They are more widespread in business aircraft. The latter tend to fly to small airports where navigation aids, such as ILS, are not as sophisticated as at large airports. This was one of the main reasons why HUDs, which can display a synthetic view of the runway, first became popular on business jets.

Other benefits are enjoyable for all pilots. A HUD allows the pilot to read critical information while looking at the outside world. Hence, there is a better situational awareness. Some HUDs offer enhanced vision (EVS, thanks to infrared sensors) or synthetic vision (SVS, where a database and GPS provide terrain images).

Two HUDs are standard on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. One single HUD is an option on the Boeing 737 MAX and dual HUD is optional on the 777X. Airbus’ designers, whose philosophy has long favoured automation, seem to have converted to HUDs. The A350 XWB thus offers one optional HUD.

According to Matt Carrico, Rockwell Collins’ senior engineering manager and fellow, advanced concepts, the flightpath vector on a HUD gives a clear idea on where the aircraft is going—the symbol relates to the outside world. His company has made SVS available to the HUD as another selectable overlay.

“We are investigating combined visions systems (CVS), the combined display of SVS and EVS,” added Carrico. In a CVS, the system determines which source (EVS or SVS) has better info, thanks to sophisticated image processing. The Dassault Falcon 5X and 8X business jets will be the first aircraft to feature a CVS HUD, designed with Elbit Systems.

Honeywell, Rockwell Collins build on large displays

In the head-down part of the instrument panel, we will see larger displays. “The current 15-inch standard is here for years to come,” Carrico believes. A decade ago, there was hope for organic light-emitting diodes (OLED) to fill up the entire forward space. However, today’s OLED technology is far from the aviation industry’s expectation for a 20-year lifetime. If used in sun-readable conditions, an image-retention phenomenon may happen in the long run—a problem similar to that encountered with old cathode ray tube displays.

Large displays are “a simple way for the pilot to assemble the elements,” said Carrico. They offer feature-rich visualization and topology maps. With old “steam gauge” style cockpits, pilots had to do a lot of mental gymnastics to form an image in their mind. The trend is building, as overlays (such as a weather chart) eliminate the need to look at two or three different displays.

Aaron Gannon, a Honeywell scientist for advanced technology, explains it in terms of communicating to the right part of the brain. “Thanks to graphic displays, we can connect directly to the visual cortex, located at the back of your head,” he said.

Some tasks are better suited to think graphically, while others are rather suited to text. “We know that better thanks to our work in cognitive sciences,” added Bill Rogers, Honeywell’s engineering senior fellow, advanced technology.

With larger displays and better organization, additional information could be put up front more effectively. Less information would be buried in menus, and the pilot would not need to remember where a piece of information is located, as they used to do with old cockpit layouts.

But replacing two displays with a larger one has drawbacks. “Discrete displays provide redundancy,” emphasized Doug Harris, Honeywell’s senior manager, technical hardware, advanced technology. His team is looking at technologies that could provide redundancy on a single display.

Honeywell engineers are testing all sorts of interfaces, including hand gestures, but believe some hard controls will remain as quick-action enablers. Jay Beckman Photo

Touchscreens versus hard controls

Are touchscreens really the next big move? Again, business aviation is at the forefront of the trend. For example, Rockwell Collins is to certify, over the coming months, a cockpit upgrade for the King Air line of turboprops. The Pro Line Fusion Touch avionics suite uses touchscreens for primary and multifunction displays (PFD, MFD).

“It has large, easy-to-select features, a hand anchor and the distance between the pilot’s shoulder and the screen is reasonable,” commented Rockwell Collins’ Carrico. The touch interface is often much faster than conventional controls or even a cursor-control device (CCD). This can be felt especially for otherwise-complex system management and navigation tasks.

Nevertheless, the crew may use an alternative hard control on the pedestal. This will probably be only for medium to strong turbulence. Using the touchscreen in light turbulence is fine, according to Carrico. The Pro Line Fusion Touch upgrade may not be as advanced as Thales’ demonstrator, but it will be one of the very first certified avionics suites using touchscreens for PFDs and MFDs.

Honeywell’s specialists, too, are embracing touchscreens but are taking a cautious approach to their design choices. “There are at least a dozen different touchscreen technologies. One can be better in terms of force feedback (to avoid inadvertent touch) while the other one is better against electromagnetic interference,” said Honeywell’s Harris. In future, a touchscreen could even provide haptic feedback. There are tradeoffs with each. “We are working on technologies to mitigate the issues caused by fingerprints, such as reduced sunlight viewability,” he added.

Honeywell has a full-motion flight simulator where experts evaluate touchscreens, among other man-machine interfaces, in various locations—overhead, front, pedestal, etc. “We measure control accuracy and other aspects of performance,” continued Harris.

Hard controls like push buttons, however, are unlikely to disappear. “We want to use some controls quickly,” commented Rockwell Collins’ Carrico. Hence the need for a hard, one-action control. The need is driven by the criticality of the action but mainly by the frequency of use. “An example is the landing lights. During taxi, the crew does not even want to look at the display to find the lights’ control, they do not want to lose that muscle memory,” Carrico stressed. Therefore, Rockwell Collins will not integrate everything into touchscreens or CCDs and will keep some push buttons and rotating knobs.

The third design feature business aviation seems to be pioneering is the active sidestick for fly-by-wire controls. Airbus, the first commercial aircraft manufacturer to have introduced sidesticks, has long despised active versions as useless sophistication. Yet, the in-development Gulfstream G500 and G600 large-cabin business jets will feature active sidesticks.

Supplied by BAE Systems, the active sidesticks not only move in concert, but also provide force feedback to inform each crewmember about what the other one is doing. “This will help crew coordination,” Carrico noted.

The question now is to see which commercial passenger manufacturer will be the first to be inspired by Gulfstream’s move.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9698217511177063}",neutral,0.9698217511177063,0

MDA Tops List of Commercial Communications Satellite Manufacturers - Defense & Security Monitor,"Tue, 23 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vZHNtLmZvcmVjYXN0aW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC5jb20vMjAxNS8wNi8yMy9tZGEtdG9wcy1saXN0LW9mLWNvbW1lcmNpYWwtY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnMtc2F0ZWxsaXRlLW1hbnVmYWN0dXJlcnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"by Bill Ostrove, Space Systems Analyst, Forecast International.

Over the next 10 years, the top five commercial communications satellite manufacturers will be MDA, Airbus Defence and Space, Boeing, Thales, and Lockheed Martin. The companies are ranked based on forecast value of production of their satellite products between 2015 and 2024. Although it is recognized that other companies act as subcontractors, this list is determined by estimating revenues of the prime contractors in the commercial communications satellite industry.

The top five manufacturers, in order, are:

MDA

MDA vaulted to the top of Forecast International’s ranking of communications satellite producers with its purchase of Space Systems/Loral (SSL) from Loral Space & Communications. SSL’s primary offering in the communications satellite market is the 1300 satellite bus. A number of satellite operators have selected the 1300 for future production, including EchoStar, Intelsat, and SES SA. The 1300 has been competitive in the large satellite market. New applications, such as broadband Internet, require large satellite platforms that can support large payloads.

Airbus Defence and Space

Airbus’ place in this ranking is based on the solid sales of its Eurostar 3000 satellite bus. The Eurostar continues to generate sales, and will be delivered to satellite operators such as Eutelsat in France, DirecTV in the U.S., and the Russian Satellite Communications Company (RSCC) in Russia.

Boeing

Boeing has placed renewed emphasis on commercial satellite manufacturing in recent years. This is due to an expected downturn in military satellite contracts as the U.S. government reduces spending. Boeing has been successful in its goal of increasing commercial sales, which has resulted in its rising place on Forecast International’s list of manufacturers. Over the next 10 years, Boeing will deliver satellites to Asia Broadcast Satellite, Inmarsat, and Intelsat.

Thales

Thales is listed as the prime contractor to build satellites for a number of major operators, including Eutelsat and Globalstar. The company has also recorded sales for regional, nationally owned satellite operators, such as in Turkmenistan. As communications satellites get larger, demand for Thales Alenia’s Spacebus 4000 platform will increase.

Thales is also the prime contractor for the Iridium NEXT program. Iridium NEXT satellites will be delivered in high numbers over the next three years, driving Thales’ expected deliveries to 103 over the next 10 years.

Lockheed Martin

Like Boeing, Lockheed Martin has begun to place more focus on the commercial market due to declining military sales; however, Lockheed Martin has not turned to the commercial market with the same drive as Boeing, and it has not recorded quite as many sales as its competitor. Lockheed Martin’s A2100 satellite bus will be used for programs such as NewSat’s Jabiru-1.

The latest MARSBalloon mission has safely returned to Earth and Dr Claire Parfitt hopes that, for the schoolchildren who took part, this will launch their love for space.

Firestar, the fifth MARSBalloon flight, flew across the southwest of England on Friday 17 June, rising almost 31 kilometres into the Earth’s atmosphere.

On board were 80 student experiments from 42 schools across the UK, all testing the impact of Mars-like conditions on anything that humans might want to do or take to Mars in the future. At this altitude, conditions are very similar to those on the surface of Mars: temperatures drop to -50°C, pressure is 1/100th that of sea level and there are increased levels of radiation.

The MARSBalloon team – Claire, Andrew and Mike – was particularly impressed with the creativity and variety of experiments submitted, which have to individually fit in a Kinder Egg™ capsule. Firestar was loaded with a sheep's eye balls, UV florescent slime, photochromic paper, smoke matches, magnesium ribbon, toothpaste, enzymes, algae, live plants, sea monkey eggs, antibiotics and several electronic sensors.

The aim of MARSBalloon is to engage primary and secondary schoolchildren with the world of space science and help them discover the career opportunities in this fast-expanding industry. Claire is a Spacecraft Systems Engineer at Thales Alenia Space UK and says: “Space is a growing and exciting industry to be involved in and my job is so varied on a day-to-day basis, it’s impossible to get bored!”

Taking your career into space

Since completing her PhD three years ago, Claire has worked on the ExoMars Rover, which will be sent to Mars in early 2018 to explore the red planet, as well as being involved in a nuclear engine for interplanetary probes and a student mission to take photographs of the surface of the Moon.

While working at Thales Alenia Space UK, she has progressed to lead the nano-satellite development activities for the business.In an industry that is still predominantly male-dominated, what advice does Claire have for women with an interest in space? “The only person that can to stop you doing what you’re most passionate about is you, so go for it! There is a gender imbalance in engineering but I don’t notice it anymore.

One of the great things about the space industry is the community spirit; we work as a team to get something into space. Gender, age and background are irrelevant; I feel respected as an engineer. The space industry is definitely not a hostile environment for female engineers.” Dr Claire Parfitt, Spacecraft Systems Engineer, Thales Alenia Space UK

Early inspiration

Before joining Thales Alenia Space UK, Claire received a first class honours degree in Physics from the Open University and completed her PhD on next-generation spacecraft power systems at the University of Warwick.

Claire says: “I studied Physics at the Open University and the way of studying there really suited my style of learning; distance learning gave me the flexibility I was looking for. Physics, maths and science have always been my strong points academically, and space has always fascinated me, so spacecraft engineering was a natural career path for me. I even declared to my parents at the age of four that I wanted to be an astronaut!”

An early introduction to space made a lasting impression on Claire. “I remember being in primary school and my teacher was talking about the solar system. The subject fascinated me – the scale of the universe, of space – it really grabbed my attention.”

“I asked my teacher lots of questions but he didn’t have all the answers and I knew then I wanted to help find them.

I’ve always had an interest in the unknown which has followed through into my career – how will our equipment perform in the environment of space? What are the challenges on a particular mission?

""A space systems engineer doesn’t just think about building the object, we have to understand the unique environment it will be operating in and once it’s in space, you can’t just pop up to fix it! It has to work first time round and for a long time.”

Inspiring the next generation

Claire hopes that MARSBalloon, like learning about the solar system for the first time, is a catalyst for schoolchildren and that it will ignite a lifelong passion for space science, and hopefully be the beginning of a career. She says: “I enjoy being involved in MarsBalloon and seeing children inspired by science whilst testing the limits of their knowledge. They want to find out something that no one knows, for example how washing up liquid survives in space.

The Indomitable Squall: Rafale's cutting-edge radar - Hush-Kit,"Sun, 07 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vaHVzaGtpdC5uZXQvMjAxNS8wNi8wNy90aGUtaW5kb21pdGFibGUtc3F1YWxsLXJhZmFsZXMtY3V0dGluZy1lZGdlLXJhZGFyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"While the Typhoon and Gripen patiently wait the arrival of AESA radars, the Rafale has been operating with this modern sensor since 2013. The RBE2 AESA (it really needs a name) is the first fighter AESA in series production outside of the US and Japan, and put Thales at the forefront of radar technology. We went to the manufacturer of the RBE2, Thales, to find out more.

(As we have already said, the new radar does need a name- our suggestion would be ‘ravisseur’…)

What is the current contractual and funding status of RBE2 AESA?

60 RBE 2 AESA have been ordered in 2009 for equipping the batch 4 of the Rafale.

When did the first AESA radar enter service?

The first entered service in summer 2013.

How many have been delivered to the customer?

We are exactly in line with our contractual commitment.

(25 as of September 2014)

What percentage increases over PESA will the radar offer in terms of search and tracking ranges?

In terms of performance, detection range is increased by considerably more than 50% and the radar can look in many directions at the same time offering significantly enhanced tracking capabilities.

How much of an improvement will it be?

Angular coverage in azimuth is improved and very small targets with lower radar cross section such as cruise missiles can also be detected. Furthermore improvement of the situational awareness allows pilots to enlarge their potential to ensure the success of their mission.

How many transmitter/receiver modules does it have?

The active array is made up of several hundreds of T/R modules. It is confidential.

How does it compare with the Typhoon’s Captor in terms of detection range?

AESA radar of the Typhoon does not exist today. It seems to be a prototype. When it is in service on board the Typhoon comparison will be possible to be done !

What modes does it have?

RBE2 provides unprecedented levels of situational awareness, with earlier detection and tracking of multiple targets as well as the capability of using several radar modes at the same time:

• All-aspect look-down/look-up detection and tracking of multiple air targets for close combat and long-range interception, in jammed environment and in all weather,

• Real-time generation of three-dimensional maps for terrain-following,

• Real-time generation of high resolution air to surface detection for navigation and targeting,

• Detection and tracking of multiple sea targets.

Does it have aggressive jamming or hacking modes? Can you explain this more.

We will not comment this.

What bands does it operate in?

It operates in X band.

Would multi static or similar operations be possible: could the radars of two Rafales work together to detect low RCS targets?

Yes, thanks to coordination two Rafale can work together.

Is the new radar heavier than the baseline RBE2, how much weight is added by increased cooling?

It is the same weight and same interface as the baseline RBE2.

What features will the radar use to detect low RCS targets?

AESA brings the Rafale extended range capabilities supporting low observable target detection.

How long would it take to fit a RBE2 AESA to a Rafale built the with baseline PESA radar, what changes would have to made?

It takes less than 2 hours as we have just to remove the PESA antenna and to plug and play immediately the AESA antenna.

How much will it cost per unit?

No comment

Is the lack of a repositioner a disadvantage in terms of field of regard?

We made the analysis as early as in the middle of the nineties to evaluate the advantage to use or not a repositioner. Our conclusion was that this solution works well when the situation is not complex but it is absolutely irrelevant when it becomes more dense due to a high quantity of targets spread in space.

No, it is not a disadvantage. We rejected the repositioner as this solution is not relevant for the majority of the missions.

Was the RBE2 the first fighter AESA produced outside of the US and Japan?

Yes it is the first and only serial AESA produced in Europe.

Are there any plans to offer the RBE2 AESA as a radar for F-16s?

No the RBE 2 AESA is specifically designed for the Rafale.

Hush-kit is reminding the world of the beauty of flight.

Meet the new Business Class seat - Airline Ratings,"Thu, 25 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyYXRpbmdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL21lZXQtdGhlLW5ldy1idXNpbmVzcy1jbGFzcy1zZWF0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"High-Flight Entertainment: Meet Thales’ Immersive Business Class Seat

Thales, a leading provider of in-flight entertainment (IFE) and connectivity systems, is giving the industry a glimpse of the future with its immersive business class seat technology concept demonstrator. Built in conjunction with B/E Aerospace and BMW Design Works, it features an ultra high definition (UHD) 24 inch screen, touchpad controls integrated within the armrests, and eye tracking capabilities to name just a few.

See our video The Paris Air Show in 60 Seconds



Designed to personalize the passenger’s IFE to their interests and desires, it offers the potential to revolutionize the travel experience. I had the opportunity to test this innovative product and experience Thales’ vision of the future of IFE at the Paris Air Show guided by Brett Bleacher, Thale’s Director of Advanced Technology/Innovation and R&D.



Above: Brett Bleacher demonstrates features of the seat to a showgoer.

Sitting in the plush BMW provided leather seat of the demonstrator, which was situated in the Thales Pavilion, I instantly felt at ease. I began the process of calibrating my eyes to the screen, which uses a small infrared camera located at the bottom of the screen to track the movement of the my pupils. The task, in which I had to follow the movement of an aircraft as it crossed the screen, took all of 15 seconds before the calibration was successful. It felt surreal to be navigating the selection with my eyes – a concept that would have been unimaginable not too many years ago. From there, I was instructed to choose a movie. The “pod”, as my guide called it, has the ability to create a profile for individual users and was offering a selection tailored for Brett Bleacher. The pod connected to Mr. Bleacher’s cell phone through near field communication (NFC), a system that allows for the passenger to select their seat configuration, entertainment, and services before boarding the flight. Once the phone is within the pod’s field, it can be connected. To begin viewing, I directed my vision towards the Lord of the Rings movie, The Hobbit, and tapped on the touchpad located within the armrest.



Above: Taking in the UHD 24 inch monitor.

I then reclined the seat to an almost completely flat bed and watched as the screen automatically, without any manual input, changed angles to improve my view. The seat, boasting surround sound and massage capabilities, in a matter of a few moments had removed me from the chaos of the bustling Paris Air Show and placed me into a sleek, futuristic and relaxed setting. Mr. Bleacher then asked me to close my eyes as though I had fallen asleep during the movie. Incredibly, thanks to the technology of the eye tracker, the movie paused at the exact point the pod had determined I had fallen asleep. I opened my eyes and was impressed to see the movie resume. I glanced over to my guide and, sure enough, the movie paused again. This time, it was because the pod had assumed I was momentarily distracted away from the screen by some activity, such as cabin service, and it didn’t want me to miss any of the movie.

Just when I thought I had seen all of the immersive business class seat’s tricks and capabilities, I was in for one more surprise. Along the edge of the pod is an interactive virtual landscape panel on which various landscapes or vistas can be projected. In this case, Mr. Bleacher set up an image of a gorgeous sun setting on the edge of a pristine lake. Below it, a graphically presented flight schedule provided me with checkpoints to when breakfast would be served, our current location, and the eventual time we would reach our destination. To top it off, my guide then set the seat to “party mode” and I was suddenly in the middle of my personal disco.



Above: The side-mounted interactive virtual landscape acts like a window and includes a real time flight status indicator.

Several major airlines are believed to be in discussion with Thales over the full development and adoption of this technology for the next generation of business class seats. The technology on display underlines the speed with which the future of IFE is advancing and highlights the coming importance of the fully immersive experience.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998328685760498}",neutral,0.9998328685760498,0
Jason 3 satellite shipped to Vandenberg for SpaceX launch – Spaceflight Now - Spaceflight Now,"Thu, 18 Jun 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VmbGlnaHRub3cuY29tLzIwMTUvMDYvMTgvamFzb24tMy1zYXRlbGxpdGUtc2hpcHBlZC10by12YW5kZW5iZXJnLWZvci1zcGFjZXgtbGF1bmNoL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"An international oceanography satellite arrived at its California launch base from a factory in France on Thursday for fueling, testing and other final preps before its scheduled Aug. 8 blastoff on a Falcon 9 rocket.

Packed inside a specialized shipping container, the Jason 3 spacecraft journeyed from a Thales Alenia Space assembly plant in Cannes, France, to Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, the prime U.S. launch site for Earth observing satellites.

The craft touched down on Vandenberg’s runway aboard a Boeing 747F freighter at 1734 GMT (1:34 p.m. EDT; 10:34 a.m. PDT), according to an update posted on NASA’s website.

Ground crews planned to transport the satellite to SpaceX’s payload processing facility at Space Launch Complex 4-East after offloading the spacecraft from the cargo plane.

Technicians from Thales and SpaceX will prepare the satellite for launch. Inspections, fueling and mating with the Falcon 9 booster are scheduled over the next six weeks.

The shipment of Jason 3 from France to California was delayed to complete an investigation into salt contamination discovered in one of the four rocket thrusters on the spacecraft.

The technical issue has been resolved, according to NOAA, which leads the U.S. contribution to the joint mission. The problem triggered a launch delay from July 22.

Liftoff of the Falcon 9 rocket with Jason 3 is set for 0347 GMT on Aug. 9 (11:47 p.m. EDT; 8:47 p.m. PDT on Aug. 8), a NASA spokesperson said.

Eumetsat, the operator of Europe’s weather satellites, is NOAA’s partner on the Jason 3 mission. The French space agency — CNES — contracted with Thales Alenia Space to build the Jason 3 satellite platform, and NASA managed the purchase of instruments and launch services for the $350 million mission.

The Falcon 9 rocket will deploy Jason 3 into orbit 830 miles above Earth, where the 1,124-pound spacecraft will measure the ocean roughness, sea level and wave heights around the world.

The data will contribute to climate change predictions, hurricane forecasting, tide prediction, and the development of long-range El Nino and La Nina outlooks. Marine biologists, emergency responders and maritime companies could also use Jason 3 measurements, scientists said.

The mission is the fourth in a line of sea surface topography satellites launched since 1992. It will replace the Jason 2 satellite launched in 2008.

Jason 3 marks SpaceX’s first flight under the management of NASA’s Launch Services Program, the agency’s rocket procurement division which conducts engineering oversight for launches of Earth science observatories, astronomy missions and interplanetary probes.

The launch experts provide an extra layer of oversight, helping allow NASA to self-insure launches of its research spacecraft. Commercial satellite operators normally purchase insurance coverage ahead of their launches.

The launch of Jason 3 will be SpaceX’s second flight from Vandenberg. The company’s first launch from the West Coast launch facility occurred in September 2013.

Thales and Textron AirLand announced today at the International Paris Air Show 2015, that they have successfully jointly integrated Thales’s I-Master radar on to Textron AirLand’s Scorpion Jet(tm). The addition of the radar into the Scorpion’s mission system compliments the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) sensor suite which already includes a high end EO/IR capability.

Having integrated the multi-mode radar into Scorpion within just two weeks, the first flight trials took place in late May. Combined with an EO/IR camera, I-Master adds long range, wide area surveillance and target tracking. Both payloads are operated simultaneously by a single operator.

Thales is very pleased to have worked with Textron Airland to integrate the Thales I-Master radar onto the Scorpion jet. As a market leader, we are continuously striving to improve our offerings. This joint exercise shows how flexible the radar is and how easily it can be integrated onto a platform. The combination of I-Master and the Scorpion jet demonstrates a powerful ‘surveillance and strike’ capability.” Eddie Awang, Vice President Defence Mission Systems UK, Thales

Textron AirLand’s Scorpion was introduced in 2013 and has completed more than 400 hours of flight testing with an exceptionally high mission availability score. Scorpion is a highly affordable, multi-mission aircraft offering diverse capabilities including intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, advanced training and precision strike.

Aircraft features include twin-engine power, two-seat operation, large internal payload capacity, high-definition ISR cameras, wing-mounted weapons stations, and modern avionics within an all-composite structure. With the ability to get to an escalating situation quickly, yet manoeuvring at much lower speeds, Scorpion brings the ability to see and exploit perishable intelligence and strike fleeting targets, bringing tactical advantage to demanding situations.

The Thales I-Master radar is a compact, lightweight, all-weather tactical surveillance radar, providing world-leading Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) performance and Maritime Moving Target Indication (MMTI) mode. I-MASTER provides high fidelity imagery for locating and classifying both moving and stationary targets at long stand-off ranges over land and sea.

The choice of modes in a single sensor, together with its small form factor and high-performance capability, makes I-Master ideally suited for a range of air surveillance missions such as maritime security, border protection, disaster/humanitarian relief and counter narcotics.

The Scorpion jet, fitted with I-Master, can be seen from 15-18 June at the International Paris Air Show, Textron Pavilion A-2, during show hours from 8.30am t0 6pm daily.

The GradMail team caught up with Chris Dickson (right at center), an algorithms engineer from Thales’s Glasgow site, to find out more about his role and the secondment options available to engineers.

So how do you become a graduate algorithms engineer in Optronics? In Chris’s case, he worked at the Thales Glasgow site before joining the graduate programme. In this first role, which he juggled with a Doctorate in Engineering, Chris developed complex algorithms for detecting vehicles using a variant of the Catherine MP camera, a compact high definition thermal imager.

During this first position, Chris explored different applications for the thermal imager, such as detecting mine-like objects in different scenarios. This involved processing thousands of images, extracting relevant information and using this to build an object detector.



Chris’s job is highly complex and it is essential that he stays up-to-date with developments in his field by reading textbooks on optics or recent papers on image processing techniques, for example. This is in addition to the formal and practical training that Chris receives as a graduate.

Graduate roles at Thales are diverse and the breadth of activities that Chris is involved in demonstrates the value placed on graduates within the business. Day-to-day, Chris programs and writes graphical tools using MATLAB (a technical computing language and interactive environment) to allow managers to understand what the expected performance of a camera system. He also implements new algorithms proposed for investigation in C++ (a programming language), such as high dynamic range imaging or assisted detection.

Paris, France, 2015-06-16 -

The genesis of the project goes back to 2014, when the Thales Group decided to leave Neuilly for the Carpe Diem tower – architecturally elegant, innovative in its construction – with the aim of having a head office that reflects the Group’s ambitions.

The challenge was to design and create, within an accelerated 5-month timeframe, an efficient, fully customized workspace designed for the 450 workers who settled in the Carpe Diem office, including a boardroom and a showroom for the company’s cutting-edge technology and expertise. The company wanted an open, collaborative space designed to foster focus, creativity and innovation.

The concept developed by Arte Charpentier Interiors is inspired by the values of the Thales Group, a French technology leader combining innovation, stability, durability and attention to detail in high-technology fields such as aerospace, transportation, defence and security. The concept makes the head office a showcase for the Group’s global leadership. Inside, the new working environment is designed around the communication of expertise within teams. The overall alignment with the tower’s existing architecture is reflected in the interplay of interrupted sightlines and broken lines evoking rupture, precision, and the creation new points of view and perspectives. It is a vector of internal and external communication, making it the master key to all of the Group’s activities.

The design was conceived as a comprehensive project to serve different functions: shared and closed offices spread over seven floors, with specialized spaces punctuating each level (reception, showroom, cafeterias, boardroom, president’s offices, clubs, etc.). The broken line reappears on the floor and ceiling, as well as in the placement of lighting fixtures and the design of light grooves. The design is consistent from one floor to the next, one space to the next, contributing to the overall sense of the Group’s unity.

The atmosphere is minimalist and modern, featuring light colours, materials and textures that lean toward fluidity.

The execution of this project, completed on an exceptionally tight deadline, was made possible by the development of a precise, efficient methodology based on interviews and studio work on the part of the contractor, and through rapid, clear decision-making on the client’s part.

Together these fleets make up the Army’s deployable armoured fighting vehicle (as opposed to protected mobility vehicle) capability and the company, through General Dynamics Land Systems - Australia, has supported them over many years.

As such GDLS is not an unknown quantity to Defence in terms of through life support capability and for these reasons it must surely be counted as one of the major contenders for the $10 billion program.

GDLS has a range of products applicable to the wider Land 400 land combat vehicle system project, including its Combat Reconnaissance Vehicle (CRV), for which the company says there are lethality options available; the LAV 6.0, as displayed at the Land Forces exposition in Brisbane last September, and the tracked Scout SV CRV/IFV (infantry fighting vehicle), which it sees as a possible replacement for Army’s upgraded M113AS4 armoured personnel carriers.

Looking to the recent release of a request for tender for phase 2 of the project, the mounted combat reconnaissance capability, John Harriott, the Canberra-based manager of business development and marketing for GDLS-A, said his company has yet to confirm its product offering.

“But we may be spoiled for choice because we are one of the few manufacturers of armoured fighting vehicles that actually has vehicles in production at the moment,” he detailed. “The team for Land 400 combines world-leading MOTS platforms with proven in-country manufacturing, integration, upgrade and through life support in order to develop a low-risk land combat vehicle capability that will meet the operational sustainment objectives outlined in the Operational Concept Document.”

Partnership

On March 11, GDLS-A announced that it had signed a teaming Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Thales Australia to submit a bid for Land 400 Phase 2.

In a statement released to coincide with the teaming MoU Ian Cook, managing director of GDLS-A said that the experience of the two companies would enable to low-risk LCVS capability to be offered to Defence.

“This is a great opportunity for us to combine world-leading MOTS 8 x 8 platforms with proven in-country manufacturing, integration, upgrade and through-life support,” he said.

Thales Australia has a major local production capability through its Bushmaster assembly line in Bendigo and it is also looking to produce the Hawkei protected mobility vehicle in significant numbers under Land 121 Phase 4.

John Harriott says that GDLS has been in continuous contract with the Commonwealth for platform delivery or sustainment of armoured vehicles since 1992.

“We are most keen to extend that into Land 400,” he said. “In the market assessed for Land 400 GDLS are dominant because we produce effective vehicle systems tailored to the requirements of our individual customers.

“Customer relations are very important. This is all about repeat customers coming back for upgrades and new product.”

He said that GDLS products are subject to continuous test and evaluation in the most demanding threat and environmental conditions, through world’s best practice by the US Army, USMC, the UK, Canada, NZ and others.

Commonality with coalition partners is also a consideration Harriott says, pointing to the fact that Australia has benefitted from being a founding member of the world-wide LAV user group.

“Customer relations are very important. This is all about repeat customers being able to leverage long-term, respected relationships to acquire upgraded and new capability,” he added.

Industry opportunity

The scale of local industrial participation in Land 400 is not yet clear, but Harriott says the program could provide an opportunity for Australian industry to further contribute to the GDLS global supply chain.

“Armoured vehicles are GDLS core business, the company took 16 billion dollars (US) in orders last year. The opportunity for the Australian supply chain to access this market through Land 400 may enable them to develop the capability, processes and policies to compete within the global supply chain,” he detailed.

“GDLS-A will be looking to develop our Australian Industry Capability strategies around an enduring capability to ensure that we have a means of conducting cost effective repair, overhaul, sustainment and reset of capability throughout their life cycle.

“With regard to local assembly, this is a great opportunity to combine world-leading MOTS 8 x 8 platforms with proven in-country manufacturing, integration, upgrade and through life support based on maximising domestic and international opportunities for Australian industry.”

Platform selection

According to John Harriott, GDLS-A is currently performing a detailed assessment of the Land 400 Phase Two requirements in relation to the OCD and has not yet decided on a preferred platform or turret.

“We are reviewing the Commonwealth requirements with our teaming partner and potential suppliers to ensure that we understand and can achieve the requirement,” he detailed. “GDLS is most confident we can deliver a compliant response with a view to being down selected for the Risk Mitigation Activity. That is the focus of our efforts at present.”
