Thales, Europe’s leading high-tech company in the civil and defence fields, has announced the creation of cortAIx, which brings together the company’s AI capabilities in research, sensors and systems.

cortAIx is the AI accelerator that will equip armed forces, aircraft manufacturers and all critical infrastructure operators with highly secure solutions to provide them with more efficient data analysis and decision support, whilst taking into account specific constraints such as cybersecurity, embeddability and frugality that are related to critical environments.

With over 600 AI experts, around 100 doctoral students in AI and a top-tier network of industry, start-up and academic partners, Thales has been a major player in trusted, transparent, explainable and ethical AI for the past decade. The company is Europe’s top patent applicant in the field of AI for critical applications, and has incorporated AI into over a hundred of its products and services.

The defence sector is undergoing major changes related to the proliferation of data on the battlefield. And it is taking advantage of new usage in the civilian world, such as personal assistants, video analysis and noise reduction.

On the back of the investments it has made in the field of AI, Thales has been incorporating AI into its critical systems for the last ten years, in order to enable its customers to gain an edge and to become more resilient in the face of a deluge of data, threats and information.

Thales Chairman and CEO Patrice Caine, said: “Our company, which is a European leader in the fields of civil and defence high-tech, is able to draw on its mastery of AI and on the assets that are its strength: its technological expertise, its knowledge of critical domains – defence and aerospace, space, cybersecurity, digital identity – and its management of constrained environments. Thales is already developing embeddable, frugal, trusted, explainable and secure end-to-end solutions, and today it is moving to the next level by acquiring major AI capabilities, that meet the security and sovereignty needs of our customers.”

cortAIx, the trusted AI accelerator for research, sensors and systems

On the occasion of today’s fourth edition of the Thales Media Day, structured around AI, Thales is introducing cortAIx, the AI accelerator designed to expand the integration of AI technology into all of the company’s sectors of activity (defence, space, aerospace, cybersecurity and digital identity). cortAIx brings together:

cortAIx Lab – the most powerful integrated lab for critical AI in Europe , based in Saclay, at the heart of the European innovation ecosystem.

cortAIx Factory – Thales’s AI technology factory , designed to speed up the classification and industrialisation of AI development tools and use cases for system data . Thales already equips its systems with AI, and continues to identify new use cases to increase performance, such as, for instance, mission planning, air traffic management, and steering drones and robots. AI enables situations to be analysed and processed quicker and systems to be used more intuitively, in order to speed up decision-making and reduce operators’ mental workload .

cortAIx Sensors – this represents all the AI capabilities in the field of sensors within the company’s defence businesses. The Thales sensors (sonar, radar, radio and optronics) that incorporate AI offer hugely increased capabilities – both more precise and more efficient – in terms of sighting and identifying threats and targets, and they meet frugality requirements in terms of size, weight, power, as well as being resilient in extreme environments.

This trusted AI serves its end-users, who remain the final decision-makers at all times.

Cybersecure AI

In the face of the security threats of AI, Thales, which is a pioneer in the field, has developed specific assessment methods at its Toulouse-based CESTI laboratory (Centre d'Évaluation de la Sécurité des Technologies de l'Information – Centre for the Assessment of the Security of Information Technology), which is certified by ANSSI (the French Agency for Information System Security). It draws on the expertise of more than 5,800 cybersecurity experts across the company to provide tailor-made solutions for the vulnerabilities that have been detected.

Trusted AI in Thales’s critical systems

Sonar, radar, equipment on board maritime patrol aircraft and fighter jets… Thales’ solutions use the best sensor and system technologies, which cover the whole range of intelligence needs in the land, aerospace and space domains. Trusted AI, which is incorporated into these sensor technologies, lightens operators’ workloads and speeds up the detection, identification and classification of objects of interest and target scenes:

The Talios pod is designed for air reconnaissance and targeting missions, and is to be found on board Dassault Aviation’s Rafale fighter jet. Until now, the images collected by the pod were analysed on the ground, but thanks to the Thales Neural Processor, the optronics images captured in flight will be analysed in real time, and 100 times quicker, by embedded AI. With its Friendly Hacking unit, Thales provides its development teams with the ability – hitherto unseen in the industry – to submit their AI-based solutions to a cyber crash-test, with the aim of strengthening considerably the cybersecurity of systems that implement AI. AI on board maritime patrol aircraft’s AirMaster surveillance radars enables ever-greater quantities of data to be analysed, and targets to be classified in a few tenths of a second. Thales’ air defence radars perform remarkably well in detection at very low altitude. AI will provide significant help to operators in identifying small targets. AI in air traffic control systems will enable the optimisation of the sequencing of aircraft on the approach paths to airports, thus contributing to a reduction in their carbon footprint. AI will make the coordination of multi-drone and multi-robot systems easier. The controlled and secure autonomy of these systems will significantly reduce pressure on operators. Using an innovative human-machine interface coupled with AI, helicopter pilots will be able to not only prepare tactical missions much quicker, but also to change them in flight, which had until now been impossible. Pilots will remain in charge of the choice of trajectory depending on the mission objective, whilst minimising their cognitive workload. AI in radios for armed forces improves sound quality in noisy environments. It has been designed to be embdedded in a miniature chip that ensures that the autonomy of equipped devices is maintained.

Thales Adjusts Workforce to Respond to Commercial Satellite Market Headwinds - Via Satellite,"Wed, 06 Mar 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhdGVsbGl0ZXRvZGF5LmNvbS9maW5hbmNlLzIwMjQvMDMvMDYvdGhhbGVzLWFkanVzdHMtd29ya2ZvcmNlLXRvLXJlc3BvbmQtdG8tY29tbWVyY2lhbC1zYXRlbGxpdGUtbWFya2V0LWhlYWR3aW5kcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Alenia Space reported a dip in demand for commercial telecommunication satellite orders in 2023, and is shifting part of its workforce to respond to the change. Thales announced the move in its 2023 full year results on March 5.



Thales plans to redeploy 1,300 positions — 1,000 of which are located in France — to other Thales activities. Those redeployments will take place over 2024 and 2025.

Sales in the Aerospace segment totaled 5.2 billion euros ($5.7 billion), up 10.7% from 2022. Sales in Space, which is part of the Aerospace segment, were stable compared to 2022. Observation, Exploration and Navigation (OEN) activities posted a high-single digit increase in sales over the year.

Yet commercial telecommunications, which accounts for a third of sales in the Space segment, was affected by delays in executing several contracts because of supply chain issues with the propulsion system.

Thales CEO Patrice Caine addressed inflation, supply chain issues, and the changing Geostationary Orbit (GEO) market on a call with investors on Tuesday.

“Inflation has reached unprecedented levels and supply chain difficulties notably for propulsion in our case. Those have led to delays and higher costs in development of our new generation of satellites,” Caine said. “In addition, the underlying market dynamics have been changing with lower GEO satellite orders moving from 20 historically to 10 per year in 2023, while the emergence of megaconstellations impacts the business model of satellite operators.”

In 2023, Thales booked six large contracts for Observation, Exploration, and Navigation, including Italian constellation IRIDE, Galileo contract amendments, and a contract to supply payloads for navigation satellites to a country in Asia. But 2023 orders were below 2022’s performance, with no large orders in the telecommunication satellite business.

The workforce redeployment is part of a contingency plan that Caine said will adapt the workforce to the new GEO market size and maintain the company’s ability to manage constellation projects, and defense and OEN opportunities. The goal is to restore profitability on the basis of the existing level of workload, Caine told investors.

As of December 31, 2023, the Space segment’s order book stood at 9.3 billion euros ($10.2 billion) up 2% from 2022.

Looking forward, Thales expects favorable growth prospects for the other areas of its Space business.

“Despite current headwinds, we identify market opportunities over the long-term such as the new generation of highly flexible GEO satellite, software-defined satellite, the IRIS² constellation in Europe and several other LEO/MEO projects. And in defense, we see indisputable sovereign growing needs, [such as the] Syracuse IV project for the French MoD,” Caine said.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.5815251469612122}",positive,0.5815251469612122,1
"Dassault, Thales, MBDA bank ‘extraordinary’ 2023 sales, with more projected - Breaking Defense","Thu, 14 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vYnJlYWtpbmdkZWZlbnNlLmNvbS8yMDI0LzAzL2Rhc3NhdWx0LXRoYWxlcy1tYmRhLWJhbmstZXh0cmFvcmRpbmFyeS0yMDIzLXNhbGVzLXdpdGgtbW9yZS1wcm9qZWN0ZWQv0gFxaHR0cHM6Ly9icmVha2luZ2RlZmVuc2UuY29tLzIwMjQvMDMvZGFzc2F1bHQtdGhhbGVzLW1iZGEtYmFuay1leHRyYW9yZGluYXJ5LTIwMjMtc2FsZXMtd2l0aC1tb3JlLXByb2plY3RlZC8_YW1wPTE?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Three of France’s major defense companies returned record results for the 2023 financial year, and despite some supply chain challenges, appear poised well for the future with major order backlogs.

Thales, Dassault Aviation and MBDA all conducted their annual investor events over the last two weeks, with the three firms collectively announcing revenues of €27.7 billion ($30.3 billion) in 2023, a massive haul for France’s defense sector. The firms also claim €101.7 billion ($111 billion) worth of order backlogs —seemingly confirming recent statistics from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute that France’s arms exports increased by 47 percent between 2019 and 2023, compared to the previous five-year period.

Éric Béranger, CEO of MBDA, said Wednesday that 2023 had been an “extraordinary year” with €4.5 billion ($4.93 billion) in revenues and €9.9 billion ($10.8 billion) in orders — the latter up 10 percent on the “already exceptional” 2022. The Franco-British-Italian-Spanish-German missile group has a backlog of orders worth €28 billion ($30.6 billion) of which 50 percent are for its five domestic markets and the remainder for export.

Béranger said that 2022 had been a “wake-up call” with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which combined with the “dramatic events” in the Middle East in 2023, points to a “fundamental change in the world, where force is changing international rights.”

After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine the company learned that “brutally, time matters,” Béranger said, stressing that “we are very conscious of our customers’ needs to accelerate.” The group is looking at all its products, particularly ground-based air defense, “to see how we can now take this time factor into account.”

As an example, he pointed to the fact an Aster missile prior to 2022 took 42 months from order to delivery; the company hopes to slash this to 10 months by 2026. He also noted that MBDA has been able to respond to urgent operational requirements from France and the UK to integrate the Storm Shadow and Scalp missiles “under aircraft that were not made for these … in a matter of weeks” instead of the years it would have taken before 2022.

To meet its production targets, the group will be investing “at least” €2.4 billion ($2.6 billion) over the next five years, doubling production at its Bolton, United Kingdom plant, extending buildings in Italy, and doubling the size of final assembly lines in France, Béranger said.

Thales on March 5 reported revenues of €18.4 billion ($20.1 billion), up 7.9 percent on 2022. Of this, its defense and security sector recorded sales of €9.8 billion ($10.7 billion), a 7 percent rise on the 2022 figure, whilst orders rose 1 percent to €14.14 billion ($15.5 billion). The company notably took 17 orders worth a unit value of over €100 million ($109.5 million) and has a new record high backlog of €35 billion ($38.3 billion), up 14 percent. “This provides long-term visibility,” CEO Patrice Caine remarked.

Dassault CEO Éric Trappier, speaking one day later, said the €4.8 billion ($5.3 billion) in revenues Dassault recorded in 2023 was “one of the best [totals] ever” even if it was considerably down on the €6.9 billion ($7.6 billion) recorded in 2022, when the company sold six more Falcons and one more Rafale than it did in 2023. It has an order backlog of €38.5 billion ($42.2 billion) which is equivalent to 10 years’ worth of work.

Looking to the future, Trappier said that there were prospects for more exports of the Rafale jet, but, as usual, refused to be drawn on where these might be. He did specify however, that despite Germany having lifted its embargo on the Eurofighter being exported to Saudi Arabia, Dassault was continuing to “work with Saudi Arabia and most notably with its air force.” He added that “we’re also working very hard with them concerning their request that local industry be involved.”

Trappier, who doesn’t usually shy away from criticizing the European Commission, said he “rejoiced” in the March 5th announcement by the Commission concerning the launch of a European Defense Industry Strategy (EDIS) which, he said, showed a realization that Europe’s defense industry needs to get its house in order. But, he warned “between that realization and the reality of building a European defense industry it’s going to take many years and even many decades.”

Béranger said he welcomed this “positive initiative which is going to help” because “it is clearly stating an ambition and that is important.” He said that “whatever hurdles” EDIS might face “if the ambition is clear then we’ll make progress.” He said it was important for EDIS to give an exact definition of what it meant by “European procured” stressing that for him it meant that European industry maintains design authority, in other words the ability and the right to conceive, design and make products “without asking anyone else.”

However it’s not all roses, as supply chain hiccups are hampering both Thales and Dassault.

For Thales the supply chain of computer chips and mechanical components is causing some problems “which we’re addressing by looking for other suppliers and by ordering ahead of time,” Caine said.

Because there is only one production line for Dassault Aviation’s Rafale fighter aircraft it has been less impacted by these supply chain hiccups than the Falcon, which the company produces not only as a business jet but also as a maritime patrol aircraft. and which has several production lines.

Trappier explained that Dassault relies on a network of suppliers, some of which are very small enterprises highly specialized in producing a single part of the Rafale, for example. “We help them out by sending some of our people to advise them and also by paying them up front so that they can pay their employees.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5383226275444031}",neutral,0.5383226275444031,0

Among these threats, ransomware attacks continue to cause the most concern for IT professionals.

According to Thales’ 2024 Data Threat Report, security threats are intensifying in volume or severity – an opinion held by 93% of respondents.

The annual report, based on a survey of nearly 3,000 IT and security professionals across 37 industries in 18 countries, reveals a significant surge from just 47% who held that view the previous year, underscoring the rapidly evolving landscape when it comes to cyber risks.

Cyber threats continue to increase in volume and severity

Thales’ report paints an alarming picture of the ransomware threat, with over 27% more enterprises falling victim to such attacks in the past year alone. Disturbingly, less than half of organizations surveyed have a formal ransomware response plan in place, while a startling 8% admitted to paying the ransom demands.

Malware has also emerged as the fastest-growing menace of 2024, impacting 41% of enterprises over the previous 12 months, closely trailed by phishing and ransomware incidents. Cloud assets – encompassing SaaS applications, cloud storage and cloud infrastructure management platforms – remain prime targets for such attacks.

The report also shows that – for a second year running – human error remains the leading cause of data breaches, with 31% of enterprises pinpointing this as the root cause.

Compliance is the key to data security

The research found that over two-fifths (43%) of enterprises failed a compliance audit in the past twelve months – with the report highlighting a very clear correlation between compliance and data security.

Of those who had failed a compliance audit in the past 12 months, 31% had experienced a breach that very same year. This compares to just 3% of those who had passed compliance audits.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.847139298915863}",negative,0.847139298915863,-1

Thales InFlyt Experience CTO Tudy Bedou builds on the themes arising from the 2024 APEX TECH event to spotlight how Thales is incorporating the latest in-flight and connectivity (IFEC) technology into its solutions.

During APEX TECH, APEX Insights Editor Stephanie Taylor chatted with Thales InFlyt Experience CTO Tudy Bedou, who believes “people want to have a memorable and immersive experience on their flight,” and explained how Thales is committed to providing cutting-edge IFE solutions that meet this desire.

Bedou reiterated that Thales’ AVANT Up solution features Optiq 4K QLED HDR displays with more than one billion vibrant colors, explaining that unlike OLED screens, the QLED technology will not dull or fade over time and is better in the dynamic lighting condition of the aircraft cabin. He also confirmed that Thales is now developing a range of larger Optiq screen sizes than initially announced for a major airline.

Each AVANT Up screen is designed with USB-A and USB-C charging ports, allowing passengers to fast-charge their devices during flight. They can also pair up to three devices wirelessly to the display. Behind the power ports is Thales’ award-winning Pulse power management system, which gives each passenger high-speed charging of up to 140 watts for their personal devices.

AVANT Up features many digital services, such as personalization with curated recommendations. Bedou commented that Thales is always evaluating new technologies to further enhance the passenger journey.

2024 is set to be an exciting year for Thales, with its Crystal Cabin Award-winning Pulse in-seat power solution and 4K HDR QLED Optiq monitor both set to take to the skies as part of the AVANT Up in-flight entertainment system.

The company has announced multiple orders for its AVANT Up IFE solution. Since announcing that American Airlines would become the launch customer for the product, Emirates has also selected AVANT Up and will be the launch customer for Pulse. Most recently, Thales confirmed that AVANT Up will be featured on Air India’s fleets.

“Integrating with passengers’ smartphones in a more intelligent way, including mirroring and casting, has become increasingly important.” Tudy Bedou, Thales InFlyt Experience

When it comes to content, Bedou’s vision is to cater more specifically to passenger by geographic regions and demographics by bringing new ways to entertain onboard while improving the way traditional content is delivered. He stated, “We are looking at an interesting concept for a new content type to be brought on the aircraft in a very smart way.” In addition, Thales has increased the processing power in its screens to be able to be able to deliver advanced gaming, 3D assets and full 4K user interfaces for a completely elevated solution.

“Passengers expect to have the same multi-screen at-home experience in the air.” Bedou added, “Integrating with passengers’ smartphones in a more intelligent way, including mirroring and casting, has become increasingly important.” In response, Thales is introducing a new casting technology that will start flying next year, allowing passengers to project their content on the IFE screen.

Bedou’s desire for things to be “fully integrated” also encompasses connectivity: “We want to make sure that we’ve designed the best IFE that can easily integrate with connectivity to provide a seamless connected IFE experience. Being connectivity agnostic is key for us, which is why we’re always multiplying our partnerships.”

He continued, “connectivity is key to unlocking the full power of the new, industry-leading Thales digital services, so we see a fast and reliable connectivity as ‘must have’ for the future of IFE.”

Looking forward, Bedou is particularly enthusiastic about the possibilities presented by its Onboard Data Center (ODC), winner of a Crystal Cabin Award in 2023, which brings the power of the cloud to the aircraft. He explained, “It’s a very different hardware and software architecture as compared to traditional IFE servers. In developing the ODC, we took inspiration from how Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and others designed their data centers for the cloud.”

“Bringing the cloud onboard enables us to bring the latest consumer technologies, such as streaming content, personalization and eCommerce, to passengers.” The ODC is currently flying, and Bedou was tight-lipped on the details, but confirmed that Thales is already working on imbuing it with more advanced capabilities.

Bedou concluded by saying Thales has several exciting new announcements coming this year regarding advancements in accessibility, the integration of A.I., and further work in sustainability.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.5012423992156982}",positive,0.5012423992156982,1

Thales, based in France, develops solutions for a range of industries, including digital identity and security. Neural Labs provides video analysis for smart cities and artificial intelligence (AI)-based intelligent transportation systems.

According to a Wednesday (March 13) news release, the partnership aims to enable secure, efficient and practical solutions for vehicle access control and logistical planning. The two companies began working together more than 20 years ago when Neural Labs chose Thales’ Sentinel platform for software protection, helping Neural Labs automate the creation and issuance of licenses.

“As a result, Neural Labs was able to reduce costs and focus more on its customers, as well as the value of its software against competitors,” the release said. “Since then, the company has moved into a new era of digital transformation and adopted Thales Sentinel Cloud Licensing to manage its SaaS [Software-as-a-Service] offering.”

The expanded partnership lets Neural Labs maximize SaaS capabilities to deploy and update software licenses from any location for its entire product portfolio and sales teams.

“We always knew that we needed to protect our software and futureproof our business. Thales has been there with us since the very beginning to help us to avoid software piracy and make the most of every market opportunity,” said Elias Valcarcel, CEO of Neural Labs.

The expanded partnership will “prepare our software so that 100% will be offered on the cloud,” he added, “helping us to scale with flexible and practical solutions.”

Meanwhile, PYMNTS recently examined the use of AI in planning things such as smart cities by looking at the combination of that technology with digital twins. These are virtual recreations of physical objects and systems that can be made more useful with AI algorithms that study and learn from information.

“AI plays a pivotal role in enhancing the utility of digital twins, transforming them from mere static virtual replicas into dynamic and interactive models that can simulate real-world scenarios comprehensively,” Vlad Panov, vice president of engineering at the consulting firm Publicis Sapient, said in an interview with PYMNTS.

“The integration of AI into the creation of digital twins allows businesses across various sectors, such as manufacturing, to leverage these models for training, prototyping or product testing purposes,” Panov said. “By enabling dynamic simulations, AI ensures that every possible scenario is captured and reviewed, significantly improving the accuracy and effectiveness of these simulations.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7978767156600952}",neutral,0.7978767156600952,0
Thales Alenia Space to develop the radar instrument for ESA's 10th Earth Explorer Harmony satellites mission – SatNews - SatNews,"Thu, 14 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL25ld3Muc2F0bmV3cy5jb20vMjAyNC8wMy8xNC90aGFsZXMtYWxlbmlhLXNwYWNlLXRvLWRldmVsb3AtdGhlLXJhZGFyLWluc3RydW1lbnQtZm9yLWVzYXMtMTB0aC1lYXJ0aC1leHBsb3Jlci1oYXJtb255LXNhdGVsbGl0ZXMtbWlzc2lvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Alenia Space has been selected by ESA to lead a wide European industrial consortium as as result of their experience in radar-based Earth observation satellites. Together with data from Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission the two-satellite Harmony constellation will deliver a wide range of unique and innovative observations of ocean, sea ice and solid ground.

Thales Alenia Space, a Joint Venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), signed a first 7M€ contract with the European Space Agency (ESA) to develop the Earth Observation Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instrument to be embarked on the two Harmony satellites, ESA’s 10th Earth Explorer mission.

This bridging phase contract is the first step towards the final contract for the overall SAR implementation phase. Under this contract, Thales Alenia Space will lead a diversified European industrial consortium to design, develop and validate the C-Band SAR instruments and will also be responsible of the C-Band digital electronic and antenna tiles to be embarked on both Harmony satellites, expected to be launched aboard a Vega-C launch vehicle by 2029.

“ESA’s choice of entrusting the development of the radar instrument is evidence of the success and great compliance of the technology used by Thales Alenia Space and confirms our company’s long and recognized experience in manufacturing Earth observation satellites based on radar technology.” said Massimo Comparini, Senior Executive Vice President, Observation, Exploration, and Navigation at Thales Alenia Space. “The development of this instrument will allow Thales Alenia Space to make an important technological and architectural step forward improving the competitiveness of SAR products in the institutional and commercial Earth Observation market”.

Florence Hélière, ESA’s Harmony Project Manager, said, “Thanks to Thales Alenia Space’s long involvement in radar technology, I am assured they will develop the Harmony SAR instrument successfully. I’m also confident that the team’s motivation and engagement will be an asset in maintaining the schedule and meeting our rendezvous with Sentinel-1.”

Thales Alenia Space has played a key role as industry during the Harmony preparatory phase, supporting ESA in the definition of a high performing solution able to fully meet the mission scientific objectives and to develop in parallel all the relevant SAR enabling technologies.

Earth Explorer missions form the science and research element of the ESA dual-strategy Living Planet Program, which also includes the operational service-oriented Earth Watch missions. The Earth Explorer missions focus on the atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere and the Earth’s interior with emphasis on the interactions between these components, and on the impact that human activities have on the Earth’s processes.

Together with Sentinel-1, Harmony promises to provide a wealth of unique data on ocean–ice–atmosphere interactions at unprecedented resolution for more insight into upper-ocean heat exchanges, drivers of extreme weather and the long-term impacts of climate change.

The mission will also shed new light on deformation and flow dynamics at the rapidly changing edges of ice sheets for a better understanding of sea-level rise. In addition, Harmony will measure small shifts in the shape of the land caused by earthquakes and volcanic activity, thereby contributing to risk monitoring.

The slightest image gap could have significant consequences for air passenger safety.

Developed by Thales for the Dirección General de Aeronáutica Civil (DGAC), the solar-powered radar system is comprised of an advanced and efficient STAR NG primary radar and RSM secondary radar. Combined, the radars provide all the operational surveillance requirements of both civil and military air traffic control detecting both slow and fast-moving targets such as helicopters, commercial planes, and jets. The 100% solar panelled ATC radar station will help monitor the commercial flights operated daily by the DGAC in the country, providing increased safety and reliability.

Located in the Atacama Desert in Northern Chile at more than 3500 metres, the radar station will run exclusively on sustainable energy by harnessing the region's high solar incidence. Equipped with 340 strategically positioned panels, the station has a maximum generation capacity of approximately 960 kWh per day, covering an area of 10,000 m2.

Launched one year ago, the innovation in terms of alternate and greener power generation is an example of Thales’ role as a strategic partner, with engineers and technology being at the forefront to deliver sustainable solutions in all environments. In addition to the solar panels, the system includes efficient energy use and advanced battery and backup generator technology to ensure the overall operation of the station.

With more than 1100 Air Traffic radars deployed in the world, Thales is recognized as a world leader in air surveillance technology and as an innovative strategic partner within the aerospace technology industry.

“For DGAC, at a strategic level, this new air traffic control radar station is undoubtedly a great contribution to air safety in the north of the country where there is currently a high air traffic density that will be fully covered by this new system, given its measurement range, which is the highest in the market at 100 nautical miles in the case of the primary radar and 250 nautical miles in the case of the secondary radar. The environment benefits are also outstanding and unique, limiting its impact on climate change by being 100% powered by solar energy which is consistent with the Chilean policies and the ones adopted by ICAO, in line with the concept that all nations should spare no effort to mitigate and reduce the environmental impact so that the next generations and our planet have a more sustainable future.” Juan Alegría, Systems Director DGAC

”This project delivery is a milestone in the civil aviation industry and a commitment to sustainability. This is not only a technological achievement for DGAC and Thales, but also an example of environmental responsibility, demonstrating Thales’ commitment and capability to create sustainable solutions in-line with customer sustainable requirements and global objectives of preserving the environment. It is an example of a project contributing to low carbon future, and contributes to the IATA to Fly Net Zero by 2050 commitment. It demonstrates how Thales advanced technologies are helping to make the world safer and more environmentally responsible”. Lionel de Castellane, VP Civil radars segment, Thales

As part of Thales' and DGAC's commitment to ESG objectives, the companies will also strive to ensure the preservation of archaeological sites in the region. With the authorisation of the native people, the site received special demarcation, preserving the history and memory of the place, for a more respectful and harmonious coexistence.

Thales has been present in Chile for 53 years and is responsible for managing air traffic management with TOPSKY ATC C, as well as delivering 75% of the radars currently operating in the country.

The innovative demonstrator is a small form-factor, easily transportable operations centre that will enhance force agility by allowing naval operators to control up to three underwater minehunting drones simultaneously from a single computer set up on board a ship or at a shore station.

The e-POC solution builds on the M-Cube and MiMap systems, which are currently undergoing operational evaluation by the French Navy, and a number of new system developments.

The French defence procurement agency (DGA) placed an order with Thales, via the Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAr), for the provision of an Expeditionary Portable Operations Centre (e-POC) to meet the French Navy's new requirement for a drone-based mine countermeasures capability. The system was developed in less than six months and has been accepted by the DGA and OCCAr after completing sea trials and delivered to the French Navy. The e-POC demonstrator enables naval forces to conduct mine countermeasures missions quickly and efficiently using only unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs).

Thales's e-POC demonstrator is an easily transportable solution that will ultimately enable the French Navy to deploy underwater drones for mine countermeasures missions in any theatre of operations. It will provide a flexible mission management capability from outside the zone of operations, helping to keep naval personnel out of harm's way. The e-POC demonstrator runs software developed for the M-Cube1 and MiMap2 systems on a single computer equipped with three control screens to plan, execute and analyse missions requiring the simultaneous deployment of up to three UUVs. The system can be set up on board a ship or at a shore station, and is small enough to fit into just six transport cases for deployment into the theatre of operations. The transport cases are stowed inside the UUV container to streamline logistics and boost mission effectiveness.

""Thales has combined the power of innovation with the agility of its development teams to augment the defensive capabilities of the French Navy. The e-POC solution is designed for rapid deployment into any theatre of operations, making a valuable contribution to future mine countermeasures missions and helping to guarantee the safety of naval personnel."" Gwendoline Blandin-Roger, Vice-President Underwater Systems, Thales.

However, its consolidated net income fell 9 per cent (to €1.02 billion because of an “exceptional expense related to pension obligations in the UK”.

Its Aerospace division has suffered from a downturn in satellite orders with order values falling 5 per cent (to €5.5 billion). Thales says: “This decrease reflects two contrasting trends. On the one hand, strong sales activity in aeronautics activities (avionics and in-flight entertainment (IFE)), linked to a 32 per cent increase in order intake in the civil aftermarket and the IFE Emirates contract mentioned above. On the other hand, while Thales Alenia Space recorded new commercial successes in observation (IRIDE, I‑HAB) and navigation (Galileo), it did not record any new large orders in commercial telecommunications. At December 31, 2023, the segment’s order book stood at €9.3 billion, up 2 per cent from 2022.”

The end result, says Thales, is that it will trim 1,300 jobs due to “structurally weaker demand”. Some 1,000 French employees will be redeployed which will take place over 2024 and 2025, in consultation with employee representative bodies.

Patrice Caine, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented: Once again this year, Thales has achieved remarkable performances. Our excellent sales momentum continued in 2023, with the order intake once again exceeding €23 billion and the order book reaching an all-time high. Organic growth in sales was higher than expected at 7.9 per cent, driven in particular by the dynamism of the civil aeronautics activities. This strong growth resulted in an even stronger EBIT improvement, which grew by nearly 11 per cent, reflecting the quality of the Group’s business model and of its operating leverage. ​Finally, Thales once again generated high levels of cash, in excess of €2 billion.

​

​”These results reflect the trust our customers place in us, the commitment of our employees and the excellence of our technologies. I would like to thank all our teams for their contribution and dedication. ​Building on these strengths, the Group worked hard in 2023 to prepare for the future. ​In this regard, two major acquisitions will enable us to further strengthen our offers in key markets. Cobham Aerospace Communications in avionics, and Imperva in cybersecurity will provide Thales with very high added value technological bricks that are strongly complementary with our current portfolio of solutions. Preparing for the future also means setting ever-more-ambitious CSR goals. The year 2023 marked the end of an extremely positive cycle in which we achieved or exceeded all our multi-year objectives and obtained recognition from leading non-financial rating agencies. We will announce our new ambitions in this area in the second half of 2024.”

Finally, preparing for the future means continuing to increase our R&D investments so we can continue to develop our skills and technologies, which are our greatest asset. We are therefore looking ahead to 2024 with optimism, confident in the quality of our fundamentals, the strength of our positioning and the importance of our contribution to the major societal challenges of our time,” he concluded.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999996423721313}",positive,0.9999996423721313,1

Innovation is key to advancing the U.S. Navy’s long-term dominance of the undersea domain. “We need to think about how do we do battlefield innovation…We are focusing on expanding the reach, the depth, and the lethality of our conventionally manned fleet through disruptive and emerging technologies, that includes unmanned systems,” said Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Lisa Franchetti at a recent defense forum.

Through technological innovation including advanced undersea sensing and detection, the U.S. Navy has enjoyed unchallenged dominance of the undersea domain from the Cold War to the present day. This dominance has ensured that maritime highways are open to the vital transportation of goods among nations. Maintaining freedom of navigation in the face of potential adversaries who are fielding increasingly capable undersea threats is also a defining technical challenge for the Navy and its allies.

Advanced Acoustic Concepts, LLC (AAC) a wholly owned subsidiary of Thales Defense & Security, Inc. (TDSI) headquartered in Hauppauge, NY is providing the Navy with proven combat systems that address the current undersea warfare challenges of anti-submarine warfare and mine countermeasures (MCM) solutions.



AAC capability is enabling the Navy’s surface force to be more effective at hunting enemy submarines with the Combined Active/Passive Towed Array Sonar (CAPTAS)-4. The Navy selected the CAPTAS-4 Variable Depth Sonar system for installation onboard the new Constellation Class Frigates in May 2022. The CAPTAS-4 transmitter provides an unmatched sound source for detecting submarines and larger UUVs at significant distances. In October 2023, TDSI’s AAC delivered the first CAPTAS-4 to the FFG-62 program ahead of schedule. The complete manufacturing and assembly of all follow-on CAPTAS-4 systems will take place at a state-of-the-art production facility in Lemont Furnace, Pennsylvania.

CAPTAS-4 manufacturing production is underway. While identifying undersea threats is crucial in naval operations, it is only one piece in a larger group of needs. Combined data, computing power and artificial intelligence for command and control of an entire operation are all vital for success. For this reason, AAC offers system integration and sensor signal processing through command-and-control suites such as the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) Mission Module common compute environment for mine detection and targeting. This portable control station solution offers a real-time data-fused common operational picture of undersea objects of interest, transmitted from data captured by the Thales Synthetic Aperture Mine Detection Imaging Sonar (SAMDIS). The SAMDIS underwater solution, being introduced to market by AAC, uses three acoustic beams to accurately identify an object instead of one. Harnessing three acoustic beams allows users to detect undersea objects accurately while determining which are mines faster than current synthetic aperture sonar systems. The mission module combat system processes the ultra-high resolution SAMDIS imagery and uses AI-enhanced Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) software applications to quickly analyze the object and provide leaders with a detailed situational awareness picture for more informed decision-making. To complete this real-time detect-to-engage mission, AAC also offers a mine neutralization capability in the form of a small unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV). Additionally and to date, TDSI has delivered over 300 Airborne Low Frequency Sonars (AN/AQS-22) to the U.S. Navy for employment onboard the MH-60R helicopters. These dipping sonars provide the MH-60R platform with long-range detection and a wide coverage rate to clear an area of interest or as a complementary anti-submarine warfare asset to sonars onboard surface vessels for target localization and engagement.

Thales Delivers Unmanned Mine-Clearing Ops Center to French Navy - The Defense Post,"Wed, 13 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRlZmVuc2Vwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDI0LzAzLzEzL3RoYWxlcy1taW5lLWNsZWFyaW5nLWNlbnRlci1mcmFuY2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales has developed a mission planning, management, and analysis demonstrator for the French Navy’s mine-clearing operations.

The Expeditionary Portable Operations Centre (e-POC) allows operators to simultaneously control up to three underwater minehunting drones and can be set up using only a single computer system on board a ship or on land.

Thales developed the demonstrator in less than six months, completing the necessary sea trials to assure its smooth integration with the navy’s minehunting missions.

It runs on software developed for the Mine Counter-measure Mission Management system, as well as the MiMap mission analysis tool, both used by the navy to track and analyze acquired data in real time.

Thales Underwater Systems Vice President Gwendoline Blandin-Roger said that the e-POC is the product of its development team’s innovation and agility, boosting France’s capabilities for unmanned defense missions.

“The e-POC solution is designed for rapid deployment into any theatre of operations, making a valuable contribution to future mine countermeasures missions and helping to guarantee the safety of naval personnel,” she added.

France’s Minesweeping Measures

France has developed multiple initiatives to counter both land and naval mines, regulating the use of such weapons as early as 1980.

It follows the Ottawa Treaty’s mandate of prohibiting the use and promotion of anti-personnel mines, aiding in its de-pollution and destruction through organizations such as the Crisis and Support Centre.

Paris also participates in various counter-mine exercises. In 2023, sailors joined their US and UK counterparts in Exercise Artemis Trident, which allowed the forces to share best practices for detecting, classifying, and clearing naval mines.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999247789382935}",neutral,0.9999247789382935,0

LinkedIn

In the rapidly evolving world of manufacturing, Thales stands at the forefront, harnessing the transformative power of Additive Manufacturing (AM), a process with far-reaching implications that extend beyond the creation of simple objects. This technology, characterised by its ability to create complex shapes and structures, is not just about innovation for the sake of innovation, but for the addition of function to parts or the simplification of assemblies. It represents a paradigm shift in how we think about production, design, and the environmental footprint of our industrial activities.

Revolutionising Production with Additive Manufacturing

At Thales, additive manufacturing has been a game changer. Our journey into AM began over two decades ago, focusing initially on non-metals for tooling and prototyping. The technology has since matured, with Thales leading the charge in adopting metal additive manufacturing for components in aerospace, defense, and beyond. Today, every Thales Alenia Space (TAS) satellite benefits from this pioneering technology, showcasing Thales' commitment to innovation. AM widens the possibilities within manufacturing, where certain designs cannot be created via traditional manufacturing methods such as casting and milling as there is a significant increase in design freedom given in the process of building components one layer at a time. The fleet of available 3D Printers within Thales in the UK allow for the management of a stable supply chain that provides access to non-core processes and materials.

Environmental Impact and ESG Goals

Additive manufacturing at Thales isn't just about creating more efficient components; it's a testament to our commitment to eco-design and environmental sustainability. The process significantly reduces material wastage, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions. For instance, large Titanium parts within our naval products enables a remarkable reduction in part recurring cost, lead-time, CO2 emissions, energy, and material consumption. These achievements align with our internal eco-design initiatives, the Ministry of Defense's ESG requirements as well as enhancing product competitiveness.

Strategic Collaborations and Internal Synergies

Our progress in Additive Manufacturing is fuelled by strategic partnerships with academia, industry leaders and regulatory bodies, as well as robust internal coordination across Thales' business units. These collaborations have been instrumental in refining AM techniques, sharing best practices, and driving innovation. By investing in state-of-the-art equipment and research, Thales has realised significant real-world savings.

As part of the supply change transformation, adopting Industry 4.0 technologies, Thales in the UK engages with its partner facility in Morocco, an industrial competency centre specialising in the Additive Manufacturing of metallic parts.

Thales' commitment to Additive Manufacturing extends beyond our internal operations. We actively engage with external standardisation bodies, contribute to regulatory publications, and drive improvements in commercial standards and material specifications. Our goal is not just to benefit Thales but to elevate the entire industry, paving the way for more sustainable and efficient manufacturing practices worldwide. Steve Catt, Senior Mechanical Engineer at Thales

The Path Forward

Looking ahead, Thales envisions Additive Manufacturing as a standard practice within our operations, integrated seamlessly into our design and prototyping processes. Our five-year plan emphasises the continued expansion of AM applications, knowledge transfer across disciplines, and a deepening commitment to R&D. As we move towards a future where Additive Manufacturing is ubiquitous alongside the many other manufacturing processes, Thales remains dedicated to leading the charge, demonstrating the tangible benefits of this technology for our planet, our products, and our partners.

In embracing Additive Manufacturing, Thales is not just shaping the future of production but also contributing to a more sustainable world. Our journey is a testament to the power of innovation to drive positive change, underscoring our role as a leader in the field and a steward of the environment.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999990463256836}",positive,0.9999990463256836,1
"Thales takes revenue hit after unit sale, reports fiscal 2023 - Biometric Update","Tue, 05 Mar 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpb21ldHJpY3VwZGF0ZS5jb20vMjAyNDAzL3RoYWxlcy10YWtlcy1yZXZlbnVlLWhpdC1hZnRlci11bml0LXNhbGUtcmVwb3J0cy1maXNjYWwtMjAyM9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Defense contractor and biometrics player Thales says that fiscal 2023 sales for its digital ID and security segment rose 4.1 percent year over year on a constant scope and currency basis.

That segment fell 7.5 percent in absolute terms after Thales in 2022 sold its internet of things business to IoT-module maker Telit. (Thales retained a 25 percent stake in the shorn business.)

Still, the segment reported EBIT of €508 million (US$551.2 million) last year, up 2.7 percent compared to €494 million ($536 million) in fiscal 2022.

In a list of significant corporate-wide new contracts published by the company, none involved biometric production.

Thales described “high-single digit” organic growth for digital ID and security in the previous year, but only if excluding Europay, Mastercard and Visa payment cards and SIM cards. Sorting like that points to some strength in biometrics and cybersecurity products, according to the company.

The picture is a “high-single digit” drop for organic growth when including EMV and SIM business because “the decision (has) been made to preserve the profitability of these activities.”

Looking at the segment’s year ended December 31, order intake was €3.3 billion ($3.5 billion), an eight percent total drop over the €3.6 billion ($3.9 billion) reported in fiscal 2022.

Fiscal 2023’s order intake, however, represented a four percent year-over-year organic increase.

The digital ID segment performed worse in order intake than the other two principal business sectors. Total change for order intake decreased five percent for aerospace and ticked up a single percent for defense and security. Taken together, the three segments fell two percent year over year.

Digital ID and security was well behind its two sibling segments in sales for fiscal 2023.

Those who invested in Thales (EPA:HO) three years ago are up 79% - Simply Wall St,"Mon, 04 Mar 2024 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3NpbXBseXdhbGwuc3Qvc3RvY2tzL2ZyL2NhcGl0YWwtZ29vZHMvZXBhLWhvL3RoYWxlcy1zaGFyZXMvbmV3cy90aG9zZS13aG8taW52ZXN0ZWQtaW4tdGhhbGVzLWVwYWhvLXRocmVlLXllYXJzLWFnby1hcmUtdXAtNznSAYgBaHR0cHM6Ly9zaW1wbHl3YWxsLnN0L3N0b2Nrcy9mci9jYXBpdGFsLWdvb2RzL2VwYS1oby90aGFsZXMtc2hhcmVzL25ld3MvdGhvc2Utd2hvLWludmVzdGVkLWluLXRoYWxlcy1lcGFoby10aHJlZS15ZWFycy1hZ28tYXJlLXVwLTc5L2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By buying an index fund, you can roughly match the market return with ease. But if you buy good businesses at attractive prices, your portfolio returns could exceed the average market return. For example, Thales S.A. ( ) shareholders have seen the share price rise 67% over three years, well in excess of the market return (30%, not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 5.2% , including dividends .

Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns.

While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.

During three years of share price growth, Thales achieved compound earnings per share growth of 24% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 19% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time.

You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).

Dive deeper into Thales' key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Thales's .

What About Dividends?

It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Thales' TSR for the last 3 years was 79%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.

A Different Perspective

Thales shareholders are up 5.2% for the year (even including dividends). But that was short of the market average. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 7% a year, over half a decade) look better. Maybe the share price is just taking a breather while the business executes on its growth strategy. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

‘I’m not profiting from misery. I’m averting more’ – Thales’s UK boss on making missiles for Ukraine - The Guardian,"Tue, 26 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyNC9tYXIvMjYvaW0tbm90LXByb2ZpdGluZy1mcm9tLW1pc2VyeS1pbS1hdmVydGluZy1tb3JlLXRoYWxlc3MtdWstYm9zcy1vbi1tYWtpbmctbWlzc2lsZXMtZm9yLXVrcmFpbmXSAY0BaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLzIwMjQvbWFyLzI2L2ltLW5vdC1wcm9maXRpbmctZnJvbS1taXNlcnktaW0tYXZlcnRpbmctbW9yZS10aGFsZXNzLXVrLWJvc3Mtb24tbWFraW5nLW1pc3NpbGVzLWZvci11a3JhaW5l?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"For a “ferocious remainer”, Alex Cresswell is remarkably proud of his blue passport. For some, the dark rectangle on his office table is a sad symbol of Britain’s departure from the EU. But while the Thales UK boss describes watching the Brexit squabbles in Westminster from his decade-long posting at the company’s Paris HQ as “excruciating”, he smiles at the travel document.

His aerospace-to-defence-and-security business is four years into a Home Office contract to produce the passports, after Gemalto (acquired by Thales) undercut the furious incumbent, De La Rue, to win the contract.

Does he see the blue cover as a symbol? “Luckily, I don’t. It’s a commercial contract – I don’t decide what colour it should be,” he says, allowing the Observer to flick through to see a respectable passport photo with his familiar side parting. So far, 24m have been produced.

“It’s extremely important because it puts us in every citizen’s pocket,” says Cresswell. “We don’t hold citizen biometric data and our cyber­security was good enough that the risk of being breached was [low]. These were the reasons we won: ironically, because we were producing a more sovereign solution than the incumbent British company.”

Although not a household name in the UK, Thales jostles with the titans of defence and aerospace across Europe – Boeing, Airbus, BAE Systems and Leonardo among them. The group, which counts the French government as its biggest investor, raked in revenues of €18.4bn (£16bn) in 2023. In the UK – one of the company’s biggest markets, where it employs 7,000 people – sales rose 18% to €1.2bn.

Thales’s disciplines are varied: there’s weapons-making, including missiles and launchers; the contract for sonar systems for the Royal Navy’s nuclear submarines; designing the Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers; and space operations in Oxfordshire and Bristol, working on the Lunar Gateway (in effect a service station for deep space travel in the moon’s orbit). Much of its output is deeply technical: radar systems and cybersecurity kit.

In Britain, defence accounts for most of its business – and is growing rapidly. Since the outbreak of war in Ukraine in February 2022, the group’s shares have gained more than 80%, its value has swelled to €33bn and its order book has reached a record high, at €45bn.

Missiles made by Thales in Belfast have been supplied – via the Ministry of Defence (MoD) – to fighters in Ukraine, to shoot down Russian jets, drones and helicopters, and to hit tank targets. “They’ve been used to great effect in defending Ukraine,” Cresswell says. Sales have doubled since just before Moscow’s invasion, and he expects them to double again in the next two years.

So does he have any qualms about benefiting from a war in which thousands have died? “I don’t see that I’m profiting from misery. I see the opposite: by being prepared, I’m averting more misery.”

The boom in defence shares has been stoked more recently by conflict in the Middle East. Several of Thales’s UK sites, including Glasgow and Doncaster, have been targeted by pro-Palestinian protesters, throwing paint and carrying hammers. The company has a joint venture with Israel’s Elbit to deliver unarmed Watchkeeper drones to the British army. Meanwhile, anti-war demonstrators regularly protest at UK defence firms.

“It’s a peculiarly British thing that we uphold our armed forces, but simultaneously despise the industry that produces things that will protect them or make them more effective,” says Cresswell.

His office, moments from Buckingham Palace, was General de Gaulle’s wartime headquarters, and an inscription on the exterior declares: “Vive la France!”

That country’s president, Emmanuel Macron, has urged the EU to be bold in defending Ukraine amid concerns over the US’s ­commitment. Meanwhile, a long-running row over the size of UK defence spending continues, with parliament’s spending watchdog, the public accounts committee, warning this month that the MoD has not credibly demonstrated how it will manage its funding to deliver the military capabilities the government wants.

There are rules of engagement and accountability: you’re not going to have a machine making decisions to use lethal force

“We should be preparing ourselves much more for the threat that is posed to our society. History shows that by preparing, we’re less likely to be in a conflict,” says Cresswell. “I haven’t felt as uncomfortable and uncertain about the threat to the UK as I have since the end of the cold war.”

It was against that backdrop that Cresswell’s future was forged. His father was a production chemist working on the commissioning of factories and refineries. The job moved Cresswell around, giving him a “Heinz 57 schooling”, in Cambridgeshire, South Africa, the US and Hertfordshire.

In 1970s America, he began building radio-controlled planes, inspired by a neighbour. Later, a trip to the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum in Washington cemented his path. “That was it: I couldn’t do anything other than aero­space or aviation,” he recalls.

He began his career with eight years at British Aerospace (now BAE) in Stevenage as a guided weapons systems engineer. He joined what would become Thales in 1992, holding various positions, including running its land defence division. In early 2020, he took on the top UK job.

Should defence spending be prioritised over, say, the NHS? “Do we prioritise how long we wait for a hip replacement higher than the threat of our national infrastructure being brought down by a cyber-threat? Very difficult comparison to make.

“There’s a societal discussion which is absent because of 40 years of peace and prosperity. My parents knew the privations of war – the threat of war was much more present in their lives.”

Thales is in line to benefit as technology makes warfare both more complex and less about boots on the ground. Last month, the defence secretary, Grant Shapps, awarded it a £1.9bn contract to use AI to predict when maintenance is needed to keep British warships and submarines at sea for longer, amid concerns about the amount of time Royal Navy vessels have spent in port due to malfunctions.

Its AI is also being used to support air traffic controllers in optimising flight sequencing, reducing fossil fuel burn in the process. But Cresswell cautions: “There are rules of engagement and accountability: you’re not going to have a machine making decisions to use lethal force.”

Thales also finds itself at the centre of an international tug of war over the Aukus pact – the trilateral security partnership between Australia, the UK and the US.

Australia scrapped a submarine project with France when it joined Aukus, angering Thales’s benefactor. But Cresswell says Thales has sovereign status in all three Aukus countries, and he has high-level security clearances. He adds that the pact is attracting talent, as the “most exciting” event since the 1958 US-UK nuclear weapons treaty.

With regard to his space business, Cresswell admits tech billionaires have reshaped the industry. Elon Musk’s Starlink project – satellite internet arrays in low Earth orbit – have shaken up the market, but “for military and infrastructure applications, low Earth satellites are much more vulnerable”, he says. “To some extent, it’s like how Uber was going to be the death of conventional taxis but in fact the market just grew.”

Thales Data Breach: Alleged USDoD Hacker Strikes Again - The Cyber Express,"Fri, 01 Mar 2024 09:14:20 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiL2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlY3liZXJleHByZXNzLmNvbS90aGFsZXMtZGF0YS1icmVhY2gv0gEvaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVjeWJlcmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL3RoYWxlcy1kYXRhLWJyZWFjaC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In a recent cyber incident, a hacker associated with high-profile breaches including those of the FBI and Airbus, has purportedly leaked around 24GB of data allegedly linked to the defense contractor, Thales.

The alleged Thales data breach, which has surfaced on the dark web, suggests that the notorious USDoD hacker is involved in the incident, as indicated in a post shared on a dark web forum.

The saga unfolded with an announcement on the dark web, where USDoD claimed to have leaked approximately 24GB of data purportedly belonging to Thales.

Alleged Thales Data Breach on a Dark Web Forum

In the aftermath of the incident, cybersecurity experts scrambled to assess the extent of the damage and ascertain the veracity of the leaked data. Hudson Rock provided insights into the modus operandi of the hacker, suggesting a connection between the Thales data leak and previous cyberattacks on Airbus.

According to the report, the USDoD hacker may have exploited Infostealer malware to infiltrate Thales, leveraging compromised credentials to exfiltrate sensitive information.

The implications of the Thales data leak are far-reaching, with potential repercussions for national security and international relations. The leaked data, if authentic, could contain classified information related to defense contracts, proprietary technology, and personnel records.

Via a post on the dark web, the USDoD hacker displayed mockery and audacity, as it took to online forums to boast about their exploits, taunting rival cybercriminals and flaunting their prowess as a “one-man army.”

The threat actor post reads, “Hello, this is a new release of thales group leak. I have collected more than 24 GB of software by the end of last year. Yes, It is more bigger than LockBit.”

More Information about USDoD Hacker and Recent Exploits

The Cyber Express, in an attempt to learn more about the Thales data leak, has reached out to the defense organization. However, at the time of writing this, no information or official statement has been released, leaving the claims for this cyberattack stand unconfirmed. Unfortunately, the threat actor claims to have successfully breached the organization and has shared sample data to assert the intrusion.

Meanwhile, USDoD continues to operate with humor, drowned by their successful breaches and apparent mockery of law enforcement. Moreover, in a recent interview with DataBreaches, USDoD provided glimpses into their identity, revealing details about their age, nationality, and alleged connections to high-ranking officials in Spain.

The hacker, in his mid-30s, verified that he is not of Russian origin and emphasized that he operates independently, without any association to a ransomware group. Originally from South America but now residing in Portugal, he mentioned, “English is not my primary language,” according to DataBreaches.

Previously, the hacker leaked sensitive information about around 3,200 Airbus vendors via BreachForums, claiming to have acquired it through stolen passwords from a Turkish airline employee with access to Airbus’ systems.

This followed their prior breach of the FBI’s InfraGard network, where they sold contact details of 80,000 members. Despite FBI interventions, USDoD returned on September 11, 2023, leaking employee data from Airbus, hinting at future actions against top U.S. defense contractors.

Airbus confirmed the breach, attributing it to a RedLine trojan infection on the Turkish employee’s computer, likely acquired through pirated software. The recovered evidence suggested that a link between the breach and RedLine, which is a popular trojan commonly distributed through malicious emails and cracked software, often traded on cybercrime platforms.

We did some digging, and we believe the earnings are stronger than they seem.

How Do Unusual Items Influence Profit?

To properly understand Thales' profit results, we need to consider the €479m expense attributed to unusual items. It's never great to see unusual items costing the company profits, but on the upside, things might improve sooner rather than later. We looked at thousands of listed companies and found that unusual items are very often one-off in nature. And that's hardly a surprise given these line items are considered unusual. If Thales doesn't see those unusual expenses repeat, then all else being equal we'd expect its profit to increase over the coming year.

That might leave you wondering what analysts are forecasting in terms of future profitability. Luckily, you can depicting future profitability, based on their estimates.

Our Take On Thales' Profit Performance

Because unusual items detracted from Thales' earnings over the last year, you could argue that we can expect an improved result in the current quarter. Based on this observation, we consider it likely that Thales' statutory profit actually understates its earnings potential! Better yet, its EPS are growing strongly, which is nice to see. At the end of the day, it's essential to consider more than just the factors above, if you want to understand the company properly. So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing. For example - Thales has we think you should be aware of.

This note has only looked at a single factor that sheds light on the nature of Thales' profit. But there is always more to discover if you are capable of focussing your mind on minutiae.

This technological innovation places Chile at the forefront of sustainable initiatives within the civil aviation industry for a greener future and ensures secure air traffic surveillance in Northern Chile.

Air safety is critical at all times. Whether an airspace is particularly busy, or whether it is going through a calmer period, Air Traffic Control Officers must maintain constant awareness of aircraft’s positions within their airspace. The slightest image gap could have significant consequences for air passenger safety.

Developed by Thales for the Dirección General de Aeronáutica Civil (DGAC), the solar-powered radar system is comprised of an advanced and efficient STAR NG primary radar and RSM secondary radar. Combined, the radars provide all the operational surveillance requirements of both civil and military air traffic control detecting both slow and fast-moving targets such as helicopters, commercial planes, and jets. The 100% solar panelled ATC radar station will help monitor the commercial flights operated daily by the DGAC in the country, providing increased safety and reliability.

Located in the Atacama Desert in Northern Chile at more than 3500 metres, the radar station will run exclusively on sustainable energy by harnessing the region’s high solar incidence. Equipped with 340 strategically positioned panels, the station has a maximum generation capacity of approximately 960 kWh per day, covering an area of 10,000 m2.

Launched one year ago, the innovation in terms of alternate and greener power generation is an example of Thales’ role as a strategic partner, with engineers and technology being at the forefront to deliver sustainable solutions in all environments. In addition to the solar panels, the system includes efficient energy use and advanced battery and backup generator technology to ensure the overall operation of the station.

Capacity to fire beyond direct sight: Thales opens a new era for its 68mm laser-guided rockets - EDR Magazine,"Tue, 26 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmV1L2NhcGFjaXR5LXRvLWZpcmUtYmV5b25kLWRpcmVjdC1zaWdodC10aGFsZXMtb3BlbnMtYS1uZXctZXJhLWZvci1pdHMtNjhtbS1sYXNlci1ndWlkZWQtcm9ja2V0c9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"26 March 2024, Meudon, France – Thanks to the work of the DGA-funded Defense Technology Project “Study of a Direct Fire and Beyond Line of Sight firing capability for the 68mm rocket integrated on a land carrier”, Thales has tested a new Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) firing capability with its 68mm induction laser-guided rockets (RGL).

To fire, the soldier uses the target’s coordinates in an initial phase before the laser guidance takes over mid-course.

This new means of targeting on coordinates will enable the integration of induction rockets on new carriers.

Thales is proud to have reached a new milestone by validating the test phases for rocket firing at target coordinates. This technology, implemented during a ground-to-ground demonstration, will be a considerable asset for the forces.

For the first time, an over-the-horizon firing technology has been developed and tested in real-life situations on 68mm rockets. Thales’s innovation resides in a terminal laser guidance system, enabling this ammunition to be used with greater precision in two phases: initiated on the coordinates transmitted by the forward observer, the target is then reached thanks to the laser designation. In flight, the rocket’s movements and trajectory are known at all times thanks to an on-board inertial unit. This new algorithm extends the reachable aera of a rocket while preserving its metric accuracy on impact.

Thanks to this new technology, the reachable area of a rocket has been multiplied by 100, from less than 1km² to several tens of km², providing a considerable tactical and strategic advantage at any time and in any environment, while limiting the exposure of forces to the enemy.

This milestone paves the way for the integration of RGLs on new land and airborne platforms, and for new employment prospects.

In addition to their new guidance capabilities, RGLs feature an induction system enabling rapid loading, high levels of reliability and, in particular, ejecta-free, low-maintenance applications.

Among other things, the system provides the rocket with the information it needs to fire successfully, before separation.

“The success of these tests demonstrates Thales’ ability to provide armed forces with all the tactical and strategic advantage they need. Based on the laser-guided rocket developed by Thales, this ability to fire beyond direct sight will enable forces to gain in safety while enhancing maneuverability”, Eric Normant, Vice President, Tactical Vehicles and Systems, Thales.

This milestone marks a significant leap in aviation technology following the first similar successful implementation at Almaty Airport.

A pivotal feature integrated into both systems is the installation of Multilateration (MLAT) technology – specifically the Thales’ MAGS – an innovative technology which very accurately locate the aircraft by using a method known as Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA). Multilateration employs ground stations, placed in strategic locations around an airport. This technology implementation at Astana Airport was the second in Kazakhstan – the first being in Almaty and also deployed by Thales.

This surveillance system empowers air traffic controllers with an additional sensor solution for comprehensive ground and air traffic surveillance. Particularly effective in monitoring arrival and departure traffic or overseeing areas where conventional radars face limitations or impracticality, MAGS has been very reliable. These systems have been deployed seamlessly despite stringent local climate constraints in order to never interrupt airport operations.

The Advanced Surface Movement Guidance & Control System deployed in Almaty and Astana airports emphasizes reliability and elevates safety standards. The incorporation of the –“Airport Safety Nets” module within the TopSky - Tower system plays a key role in safeguarding runways and designated areas. The module acts as a vigilant guardian, alerting controllers promptly in cases of potential conflicts between vehicles – be it aircraft or other types of vehicles – on runways and the unauthorized incursion of vehicles into restricted areas.

“We are pleased to contribute to improving surveillance and air traffic operations in the airports of Astana and Almaty with our integrated system that combines TopSky-Tower, MLAT and the use of SMR radar data. The coordination of different partners, the use of the best performing equipment and the customization of the solution to specific customer needs have been some of the challenges of the project, which has been achieved thanks to the collaboration and alignment of all parties involved” Christian Rivierre, VP Airspace Mobility Solutions - Thales","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.6271564364433289}",positive,0.6271564364433289,1

"Meet Gregory Addes, our Video Security and OnBoard solution expert - Thales","Wed, 20 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUtdHJhbnNwb3J0L2NvbW11bmljYXRpb24tc3VwZXJ2aXNpb24vbWFnYXppbmUvbWVldC1ncmVnb3J5LWFkZGVzLW91ci12aWRlby1zZWN1cml0eS1hbmTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"How can journeys by public transport be made smoother and more personalised? Gregory Addes, Product Line Manager for Video Security and OnBoard solution at Thales, reveals the surprising ways in which artificial intelligence (AI) is being used to customise the passenger experience.

Can you tell us about the work you are doing?

I am Product Line Manager for Video Security and OnBoard solution for trains. Our focus is on making journeys easier, and more comfortable. One of the main ways we achieve this is by deploying artificial intelligence onboard.

What are the big technology trends shaping the rail sector?

The first is artificial intelligence. Tesla is already using AI to transform the car industry. Now we are also bringing this AI technology on trains. The second trend is 5G. This is revolutionising communications and it opens the door to easier train autonomy. We are also seeing the rise of intelligence onboard as more and more functions move from the wayside to the train itself.

How will passengers benefit from AI?

Personalisation is one of the biggest benefits. This is made possible by AI-powered video analytics. Our solution is called DIVA – Distributed Intelligent Video Analytics. DIVA enriches the passenger experience in several ways. For example, it can detect if you are a wheelchair user: we can guide you to the most easily accessible part of the train, then adapt the door closing sequence to give you time to board without feeling pressurised.

There are many other examples. For instance, we can adapt passenger announcements and advertisements depending on the occupancy and daytime. We are also developing algorithms to detect violent behaviour.

What about operator benefits?

DIVA is transformational from an operational perspective. People on track detection is an example: with DIVA, we could detect unauthorised access to the track and give the train driver an early warning with the associated video streams coming from the platform. So it’s being able to respond to what is happening not only on the train, but on the platform as well.



We can also adapt train scheduling. Traditionally, timetables were set in stone. Today, we are working on dynamic scheduling – the ability to match the flow of trains to real-time demand, based on passenger density data from trains and platforms. All of this is derived by processing existing video data with AI.

Have any of these AI functions been deployed yet?

Yes. This passenger density solution has been deployed recently on 100 trains in Middle East and has proved its efficiency during operation while important public event took place.

What are the challenges of deploying AI onboard?

AI requires a lot of power and processing capacity – and deploying this onboard is a challenge. We manage this in three ways. First, we utilise GPUs – ultra-fast graphics processors. Second, we use frugal algorithms to minimise power demand. Third, we focus on the type of information required: what level of processing capacity is needed to satisfy a specific objective? We focus on doing more with less.

How far have we come?

When I started doing video analytics 20 years ago, we didn’t have AI. You needed to configure every single camera – it used to take hours. What is amazing about DIVA is that it works straight out of the box: I connect the camera, and it will detect people automatically. This is a game changer.

What is your background?

My academic background is electronic engineering. Initially, I was in charge of developing site security for oil & gas Company in Middle East. I was also involved in video security for the Louvre in Paris and the Caracas Metro in Venezuela. Understanding technology is a critical part of my work. But understanding the market is equally important, which is why I did an MBA. Co-innovation is now a huge part of what we do. It’s about design thinking – we work with our customers to capture their pain points and we work rapidly to develop solutions.

What is the most rewarding part of your job?

What’s amazing for me is being able to participate in innovation. I also love the fact that we rely on teamwork and talent. Some of my colleagues have 20 years of experience with trains – this domain expertise is vital. Doing a job that is useful is important to me. Not just moving people from A to B, but benefiting people’s everyday lives and providing greener journeys.

What background do people need to work in your department?

We need people with engineering talent, particularly in electronics and IT. But equally important, we need people with a talent for collaboration. That means the ability to communicate, to listen, to share, and to win together. People also need to be ready to learn.. So it’s about being able to adapt rapidly to new technology like AI.

Outside of work, what motivates you?

Being in contact with nature is important. My office in Vélizy is near the forest, so it’s easy to take a walk and it is a gift to be able to do this. I am also interested in discovering new people and cultures. I have lived in Middle East, Latin America and South Asia. This helps me in my work. How do people react to crowds? How do they interpret different types of information? Reactions vary. We need to adapt our solutions to people’s needs.

What’s your favourite train trip?

My favourite train journey is one where you have the time to enjoy the journey itself. In Brazil, you have the Serra Verde train. It’s not high-tech, but the journey through the rainforest of Brazil is amazing. So for me, it’s about taking the time to travel, and to be with people and nature.

Moreover, the evolution towards cashless societies is driving the popularisation of new payment methods, such as account-to-account transactions and Central Bank Digital Currency wallets, ensuring ease and efficiency in fare payment.

Additionally, there’s a growing emphasis on operational efficiency and resource frugality. This is driven by environmental concerns and economic constraints. Embracing these changes is imperative for the mobility sector to thrive in an increasingly digital and sustainable landscape.

How important is data security?

Ticketing systems are data intensive and the data is sensitive. You need accurate data and operational continuity to ensure that people pay, and that they pay the right and equitable fare. Ticketing also ensures security to the public thanks to gates on platforms or in stations. Security and the use of best practices are key to ensuring business continuity. Cybersecurity is a cat and mouse game: it requires constant monitoring to retain a protection level that is current with the latest cyber threats.. Like many industries that rely on cryptography, the ticketing domain at the crossroad between mobility and payments needs to prepare in the midterm for the disruption stemming out from post-quantum cryptography.

What role do data analytics and AI play in optimising processes and improving service quality?

Transport networks produce a huge quantity of data related to mobility usage, including timestamped transactions for check-ins and check-outs, passenger localisation used in mobile ticketing or be-in/be-out mechanism . So, once this data is anonymized (this is a crucial step to facilitate public acceptance), the analytics allows the identification of travel patterns and traveller habits, and facilitate the quantification of mobility demand with the view to propose the right level of mobility services and reduce congestion. It can also help fighting transit and financial fraud to protect transport operators’ revenues. AI and analytics are great tools and can enable informed, data-driven decisions.

Industry 4.0 is about digitising and optimising processes. Smart maintenance is an example of how equipment in the field can be monitored and ultimately, predictive maintenance helps maintain the highest level of quality of service. The next stage is Industry 5.0 which focuses on humans (workers in our case) and their interaction with machines and AI.

What challenges do free public transport initiatives face, particularly regarding operational costs and revenue distribution among operators?

Fully-subsidised public transport offerings are emerging. Even where local citizen travel is free, it does not remove the underlying costs associated with operating the urban mobility system. Multiple private companies deliver this service within an area, so a ticketing system is still required to count passengers and journeys so that operators get a fair share of revenue from operations based on travel usage. When travel is fully subsidised, the cost of operation is equally scrutinized.;

What first attracted you to the transport industry?

Coming from the mobile and payment world, I chose transport as an amazing new playground where sustainability and user experience are key values.

People who enter the transport industry have the opportunity to make a real difference in society and to make things much more efficient – less pollution, less congestion and less time wasted travelling. Furthermore, protecting revenues makes the mobility business more sustainable. Equally important is the citizen: being able to facilitate mobility and making payments seamless is a real satisfaction.

So it’s about having a positive impact on people’s lives by making transport easier. The most rewarding part of my job is having the opportunity to shape the future. It’s about trying to define what will be next in mobility.

What technical skills are the most valuable?

Ticketing is predominantly digital. As well as being a skill in its own right, ticketing embraces back-end, front-end and embedded software development, DevOps, cloud, data science, AI, payment and cybersecurity. All of these skills are required to bring a solution to the market. Additionally, ticketing is service-oriented: installation, operation and maintenance require versatile and rigorous people to make customers happy on a day-to-day basis.

Do you have any hobbies or interests?

I play the piano – and I am really thankful for pianos in stations. They bring people together and I have had some great encounters with other pianists.

What’s your favourite train trip?

The journey towards Aix-les-Bains and Chambéry in France. The train runs beside Lac du Bourget – it brings serenity to see the still water of the lake. I really enjoy this part of the trip!","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.894241988658905}",positive,0.894241988658905,1

PARIS: France's Thales on Tuesday reported an 11% underlying increase in 2023 operating profit and 8% higher sales, buoyed by a rebound in the civil aerospace market, while becoming the latest group to feel pressure in the competitive space business.The company posted a record 2.132 billion euros ($2.31 billion) operating profit - topping 2 billion euros for the first time since before the pandemic in 2019 - and sales of 18.428 billion euros, while its operating margin stood at 11.6%, up 0.6 percentage points.Analysts were on average expecting 2023 operating profit of 2.107 billion euros on sales of 18.177 billion, according to a company-compiled consensus.Thales, which supplies civil and military radar and digital identity systems , said its order intake was fractionally higher than the year before at 23.132 billion euros.For 2024, Thales predicted like-for-like sales growth of 4% to 6% to reach between 19.7 billion and 20.1 billion euros. It predicted an operating margin of 11.7% to 12% and said new orders would continue to outstrip revenues.The company also flagged it would cut about 1,300 jobs at Thales Alenia Space amid ""structurally weaker demand"" in commercial telecoms, and that these workers would be redeployed within the group. Some 1,000 of the affected jobs are in France.CEO Patrice Caine said there would be no forced departures as Thales tries to keep skills in-house.The move comes as the market for large satellite s in geostationary orbit - once representing some 20 satellites a year - now stands at around 10 a year, Caine said. Traditional satellite firms face growing competition from the rapid growth of constellations of small satellites.""So the market has more or less been divided in half ... and we have to re-adapt; there's no mystery,"" he told reporters.The business affected by the changes represents about one-third of Thales Alenia Space, equivalent to 700 million euros in turnover, or 4% of the group's total, he said.The shake-up comes weeks after Airbus , Europe's other major producer of large satellites, unveiled a fresh charge for its troubled space business.Caine also confirmed in the call that the company is not interested in buying all or parts of BDS, the cybersecurity branch of ailing French IT company Atos that industry peer Airbus offered to buy for 1.5 billion to 1.8 billion euros.Atos was thrown into new uncertainty last month after talks with Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky over the sale of another part of the business - that would have provided urgently needed cash -collapsed.""Our position has been unchanged for months and months"", Caine said, adding that Thales had already made other acquisitions in the cybersecurity sphere including that of Imperva. ""We are concentrating on those subjects, so no change"".","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.985910177230835}",positive,0.985910177230835,1
Aeronautics sector: the Autorité clears the takeover of Cobham Aerospace by Thales - autoritedelaconcurrence.fr,"Mon, 25 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9yaXRlZGVsYWNvbmN1cnJlbmNlLmZyL2VuL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2UvYWVyb25hdXRpY3Mtc2VjdG9yLWF1dG9yaXRlLWNsZWFycy10YWtlb3Zlci1jb2JoYW0tYWVyb3NwYWNlLXRoYWxlc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The parties to the acquisition

The Thales group is active in the aeronautics, space, land transport, security and defence sectors. In the aeronautics sector in particular, Thales offers a wide range of products and services for both civilian and military needs. Thales is jointly controlled by the French State and the Dassault group.

Cobham Aerospace develops and sells in-flight communication and connectivity products for civilian and military aviation customers. Prior to the transaction, Cobham Aerospace was wholly owned by UK-based Cobham Limited, which is ultimately controlled by the Advent International Corporation investment fund.

The Autorité rules on the avionics market for the first time

The transaction mainly concerns the avionics markets, which has never before been subject to a decision by the Autorité. Avionics cover a wide range of electronic equipment found primarily in aircraft cockpits and designed to perform functions related to in-flight communication and navigation, as well as aircraft control and command systems. The buyers of these products are mainly aircraft or helicopter manufacturers such as Airbus, Boeing, Dassault and Gulfstream, which can buy them either separately or assembled as an “avionics suite”.

Thales produces a broad portfolio of avionics products. The target company (Cobham Aerospace) mainly supplies equipment dedicated to aircraft communications, which it sells directly to aircraft and helicopter manufacturers or to designers of avionics suites, such as Thales. Its products include audio and radio management equipment, as well as satellite communications systems to ensure flight safety. It also offers a range of antennas for certain avionics products.

The Autorité was able to rule out any risk of harm to competition in the markets concerned

Although the transaction will enable Thales to strengthen its avionics portfolio, the Autorité considered that it was unlikely to harm competition.

The Autorité noted that the transaction did not harm competition through horizontal effects in the markets for avionics products sold by the two parties, given the moderate overlap of activities and relatively limited market shares of the parties. It also noted the presence of competitors in these markets and the existence of significant countervailing power on the part of customers.

The Autorité also considered that the transaction would not give rise to any vertical effects involving the foreclosure of access by the parties’ competitors to products sold by the target (input foreclosure) or refusal by Thales to purchase products sold by the target’s competitors (customer foreclosure). In this respect, it noted that the parties’ sometimes significant market shares concerned only a limited number of markets and that the presence of credible competitive alternatives and the existence of customer countervailing power made a negative impact on competition unlikely.

Lastly, the Autorité looked into possible conglomerate strategies [1] that the new entity could implement by strengthening its avionics portfolio. Given the new entity’s significant market shares in a limited number of markets, the existence of alternatives to the products on offer and the way avionics products are sourced, which gives customers considerable leverage, it considered that the new entity would not be in a position to implement such strategies. In any case, according to the Autorité’s analysis, these strategies would have limited effects in the markets, given the ability of the new entity’s main competitors to replicate them.

At the end of its competitive analysis, the Autorité therefore unconditionally cleared the transaction.

[1] Conglomerate effects may arise when the new entity expands or strengthens its presence in markets that are different from those in which it is active, but which are sufficiently related to enable it to increase its market power.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999879598617554}",neutral,0.9999879598617554,0

Preparing for quantum computing’s big break

The formation of RESQUE comes as fears that quantum technology’s capability to break encryption algorithms at hitherto unprecedented scale and speed could lead to increasingly complex cyberattacks on sensitive data.

While quantum computers still lack enough processing powers to break cryptographic algorithms, cryptographers are preparing for what is known as “Q-Day”, when quantum computing will be powerful and accessible enough to be used to unleash computing attacks that involve breaking existing algorithms. Cryptographers are making headway to design new algorithms that will be able to fend off any attacks conducted by quantum computers, ensuring the protection of sensitive data on a national and global level.

RESQUE’s work will involve developing a post-quantum cryptography solution. Post-quantum cryptography is the creation of cryptographic algorithms that are considered secure against cryptanalytic attacks by quantum computers.

Planning ahead for quantum computing threat resistance

The project will focus on two use cases: developing a hybrid post-quantum virtual private network to provide user access to information systems that is safe, simple and quantum resistant; and a high-performance post-quantum hardware security module to secure whole systems and for integration with other products.

Thales already invests €4 billion a year in R&D, with growing focus in quantum technologies, 6G, Edge computing and cybersecurity.

TheGreenBow focuses on software development for secure communication systems. CryptoExperts helps the security industry benefit from the latest available advances in cryptography to improve their products and services. CryptoNext Security is a start-up software vendor specialising in quantum computer-resistant cryptography, with a range of integration tools and post-quantum application plugins to support end-user businesses and integrators in their post-quantum migration roadmap for long-term efficiency.

John Dix, Sales – Land Communications, Thales

There were times when we couldn’t take doctors out in the field with us when I served, for a few good reasons: some were not commando trained and therefore couldn’t deploy to the forward edge; they were a precious resource and therefore held a tactical step back; and they weren’t equipped for the demands of field operations. What we did have, was medical monitoring equipment that could be connected to communications networks and provide telemedicine capability. A nifty piece of kit, about the size of a shoe box, that allowed us to connect sensors onto a teammate who’d been wounded in action. Critical health data – blood pressure, heart rate, and so on – were communicated across to a doctor many miles away who could then monitor the situation and prescribe treatment as if they were right there with us.

Our teammate received the care needed, at the speed required. But we were all too aware of the security and network vulnerabilities that could have been exposed and exploited by an advanced adversary: you might be more connected, but at what cost?

Emerging challenges, evolving war fighters

The telemedicine capability was just one asset among many we were carrying. After all, we had a job to do, and we had multiple pieces of equipment to help us achieve it. Today’s soldier is no different. More than a person, they’re a platform, fitted with sensors, systems, and other networked devices that all produce data utilised organically, tactically or strategically.

The soldier and teams, squads, or platoons, kitted up, will be dropped into a potentially complex, loud and busy battlefield – one that is contested, congested and needs to be highly connected. They’ll face pervasive, persistent threats from asymmetric, near-peer and peer adversaries, most probably concurrently. As the pressure mounts and their Observe-Orient-Decide-Act (OODA) loop narrows, soldiers need the most appropriate equipment configuration for the specific mission at hand – and they need it to simply work first time, every time. It needs to be intuitive and simple to use. It needs to interoperate with other systems, enabling teams to gain a low latency and high assurance shared understanding of the situation at hand.

Above all, a soldier’s equipment configuration needs to reduce the cognitive burden on its user so that they have more time to devote to making faster, sharper decisions, with the most appropriate data, when time is rarely – if ever – on their side. This is as true for those serving in the British armed forces, as it is for our allies, hastening the need to streamline decision making across different divisions, domains, and time zones.

Securing the individual: soldiers as integrated systems

The soldier is, after all, at the heart of it all. Whatever the future digital operating environment might look like, there will always be a need for boots on the ground. So, if allied land forces are to deliver operational effect, we need to build from the ground up to ensure that every soldier has what they need to be better today than they were yesterday, and better tomorrow than they are today.

Put into practice: imagine a digital operating environment where soldiers, equipment, platforms, and information work seamlessly, as one cohesive, dynamic ecosystem, extending from pre-battle planning to on-field operations. Soldiers equipped with secure radio communications solutions, such as Thales’ SquadNet, receiving streamlined, real-time ISTAR provided by a platform such as Thales’ Watchkeeper UAS. Such a future entails connected, interconnected and intra-connected architectures of data, equipment, and communications across different forces and domains, culminating in a battlefield where every element is optimised for the sake of the information and operational advantage.

It’s enough to resurface the question I posited in my opening example – you might be more connected, but at what cost? – but it’s a concern we can assuage through data-centric security which prioritises the assured, cryptographically-secure transfer and exchange of information, resulting in a range of benefits such as immutability, security, verifiability, resilience and transparency.

Data-centric security entails the creation of dynamic, trusted communities, consisting of assured identities – from physical soldiers and digital avatars, to assets, systems and whole systems of systems – that can communicate seamlessly, reconfigure on the fly, and adapt as the operational context requires. Through this approach, the right people and the right platforms get the information they need, when they need it, without distractions and with less risk of network vulnerabilities or compromised data. Systems, soldiers and assets coalesce in pursuit of a common goal, underpinned by cyber and bound by a shared situational awareness to protect whole units at the system of systems level.

Forging the path to a dynamic digital battlefield

This tantalising vision of what the future digital battlefield could look like is no mirage. It’s a tangible, attainable goal – and initiatives like the MoD’s Digital Identity for Defence Programme, the Digital Backbone and the Data Strategy for Defence all support and prove that the MoD understands the problem. It’s now up to industry to help design the solutions, and so put the UK defence sector further along the path towards a more resilient, agile and cohesive digital battlefield.

Because planning a simple operation shouldn’t take weeks when events around the globe are time sensitive. Soldiers shouldn’t have to grapple with dissonant bits of kit when they’ve got seconds to act. Teams shouldn’t have to contend with delayed, impartial or otherwise incoherent intelligence on what decision to make when they’ve only got one chance to make the right one.

Make no mistake: everyone should be thinking about how to solve this. The future digital battlefield is, of course, inherently unknowable and unpredictable. But, through hard graft, grit, collaboration, and relentless innovation, we can start to shape it on our terms. It’s why Thales has spent the last four years developing product roadmaps, data-centric security with zero-trust architectures front-of-mind. It’s why events like Future Soldier Technology should be in everyone’s diary to understand what is coming on the horizon. Just like the systems that will define tomorrow’s digital battlefield, we’ll need to work as one in order to support maintaining the tactical advantage on the front line.

Future Soldier Technology

Thales will be at Future Soldier Technology between 11-13 March. John’s talk, ‘The defining role of data-centric security in complex future warfare’ will be at 12pm on 11 March and you can also visit the Thales team at their stand.

Thales will provide satellite communications for the F126 frigates with SurfSAT-L solutions. This modernized system, previous versions of which have been in service with multiple Navies across the world, will ensure improved connectivity even under difficult operational conditions. The F126 frigates, designed by Damen Naval, will be the largest in the German naval fleet and will be capable of operating in all latitudes. They require protected resilient satellite communications that meet the elongation constraints between the theatre of operations and the command centers of maritime operations to fulfil their missions.

A total of four SurfSAT-L and one Land-Based Training System will be delivered to the German Navy. This milestone marks a further step in the deployment of the new version of the SatCom SurfSAT-L. This secured naval terminal has become an essential tool in the field of satellite communications. Designed for ships from frigates to aircraft carriers, SurfSAT-L has been used by the French Navy and has already been adopted by five other countries in Europe and the Middle East. The SurfSAT-L is a robust, compact, and easy-to-use solution. It has been designed in collaboration with end-users, enabling rapid deployment and mission configuration. F126 will be equipped with a very high-power tri-band (Ka mil, Ka civil, X) SatCom solution, enabling simultaneous transmission on these three frequencies. The system is capable of connecting to Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) and Geostationary Orbit (GEO) satellites, both military and commercial, for optimal connectivity and extended coverage for the German Navy's F126 frigates. Even in a multi-spot satellite architecture, the system is able to maintain optimum connectivity.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8855950832366943}",neutral,0.8855950832366943,0

The contract, Maritime Sensor Enhancement Team (MSET), will sharpen the focus on equipment availability, predicting problems - through AI innovations and data management - rather than reacting when they emerge. The contract will support over 450 highly skilled, UK-based, engineering, IT and supports jobs as well as many hundreds of apprenticeship and training opportunities all across the UK.

During the life of the MSET contract, the Royal Navy will undergo a significant transition including the introduction of the new Type 26, Type 31 and Dreadnought platforms, as well as autonomous systems. MSET, a scalable service model, will provide greater stability and breadth in the level of support delivered to the Royal Navy during this complex transition period. By investing in new dockland facilities, AI, data analysis tools, and skills, this will deliver greater resilience for the RN platforms. Over the life of the contract, it will deliver an average reduction in Turn Around Times of 100 days per repair, spares lead times will be reduced by an average of 44 days and reliability improved by 10%. Data Driven Decision making will enable MSET to see beyond the current support horizons and with the increased investment in emerging technologies, including AI, virtual reality and Big Data, create a more proactive and predictive maintenance regime.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9806774258613586}",positive,0.9806774258613586,1
Thales modernises ATM at Astana and Almaty airports - Regional Gateway,"Mon, 18 Mar 2024 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlZ2lvbmFsZ2F0ZXdheS5uZXQvdGhhbGVzLW1vZGVybmlzZXMtYXRtLWF0LWFzdGFuYS1hbmQtYWxtYXR5LWFpcnBvcnRzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales has successfully deployed its state-of-the-art Advanced Surface Movement Guidance & Control Sysstem (A-SMGCS) at Astana Airport in Kazakhstan. The announcement follows a similar deployment at Almaty Airport.

A pivotal feature integrated into both systems is the installation of Multilateration (MLAT) technology, specifically the Thales’ MAGS (Multilateration and ADS-B Ground Surveillance System). Multilateration employs ground stations, placed in strategic locations around an airport.

The surveillance system empowers air traffic controllers with an additional sensor solution for comprehensive ground and air traffic surveillance. These systems have been deployed seamlessly despite stringent local climate constraints in order to never interrupt airport operations.

Meanwhile the Advanced Surface Movement Guidance & Control System deployed at both airports underlines reliability and elevates safety standards. The incorporation of the ‘Airport Safety Nets’ module within the TopSky – Tower system plays a key role in safeguarding runways and designated areas. The module acts as a vigilant guardian, alerting controllers promptly in cases of potential conflicts between vehicles – be it aircraft or other types of vehicles – on runways and the unathorised incursion of vehicles into restricted areas.

“We are pleased to contribute to improving surveillance and air traffic operations in the airports of Astana and Almaty with our integrated system that combines TopSky0-Tower, MLAT and the use of SMR radar data,” said Christian Rivierre, VP Airspace Mobility Solutions at Thales. “The coordination of different partners, the use of the best performing equipment and the customisation of the solution to specific customer needs have been some of the challenges of the project, which has been achieved thanks to the collaboration and alignment of all parties involved.”

With the war in Ukraine boosting demand for missiles, Thales' Belfast factory is stepping up production with the inauguration of a new mostly automated production line.The French group's Northern Ireland factory makes Starstreak short-range surface-to-air missiles and Lightweight Modular Missiles (LMM) that can be used against both air and ground targets. It also assembles NLAW anti-tank missiles for Swedish group Saab.While production barely hung on during the post-Cold War period, Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 set off a surge in demand.""Output has doubled in two years to the highest level that we've ever produced, and it will double again in the next two years,"" said Alex Cresswell, who heads up the British unit of Thales.The company declined to specify production numbers, but these short-range missiles that can be shoulder-fired have been in high demand in the Ukraine conflict.Even before Russian troops tried to seize all of Ukraine, Britain had already supplied 3,500 NLAWs and during the first weeks of the war promised another 6,000 missiles.Since the start of the war London has provided £7.1 billion ($9.0 billion) in military aid to Ukraine, including £2.5 billion delivered in 2024, making Britain one of Kyiv's top supporters.""In 2022, Thales Belfast’s products became a vital asset for UK supplies to Ukraine,"" British defence think tank RUSI said in a recent report.""It underlined the value of inexpensive weapons that could bring down helicopters and low-flying, fixed-wing aircraft (Starstreak) and anti-tank weapons (including NLAWs), which played an important role in denying Russian hopes of a quick victory.""On behalf of the British military, Thales also trained hundreds of Ukrainian troops on using Starstreak, which accelerates to Mach 3 and then launches three explosive darts at its target.In order to boost production, the factory hired 140 people last year, taking staffing to 900. It plans to recruit another 100 workers this year.In an immense hall, technicians with big magnifying glasses and soldering irons assemble missile components. Further along is an area dedicated to assembling NLAWs.A third area remains empty but is slated to host a second production line.Whether it is components, raw materials or key skills, Thales has managed to stay ""one step ahead of any chokepoint,"" said Angus Cameron, the company's UK Business Director of Advanced Weapon Systems.That is due to Thales having anticipated a boost in demand and setting up contracts with suppliers even before having contracts in hand, said Creswell.Such anticipation is necessary as launching production of certain components such as motors and warheads can take up three years.In 2013, three years after the last British order for the Starstreak, which has been in use since the mid-1990s, Thales made ""a very, very large commitment in the supply chain of Starstreak and we still have to this day some of the supply chain components to make missiles,"" said Creswell.""The limiting factor in all of that is not our own facilities, it's the supply chain,"" said Creswell.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8903907537460327}",neutral,0.8903907537460327,0

Credit: Belga / Jonas Roosens

In a globally coordinated effort, pro-Palestinian activists halted operations at OIP Sensor Systems in Oudenaarde and Thales in Herstal at 06:30 on Monday.

Approximately 70 participants in Oudenaarde in eastern Flanders chained themselves to the entrance of the industrial zone where OIP Sensor Systems is located. Several activists also occupied the building’s roof. Meanwhile, around 50 activists blocked the entrance and passage to Thales in Herstal.

The protesters are criticising these firms’ contributions to what they believe is an ""Israeli apartheid"" through their supply of arms and military technology which, they argue, enables the ""siege of Gaza"". They are calling for an immediate arms embargo.

The activists aim to cut off the stream of Western weapons that they argue fuel the ongoing conflict. In their view, eliminating this support could see Gaza bombardments cease within three days.

OIP Sensor Systems, the activists underline, is entirely owned by Elbit Systems, ""Israel’s largest private manufacturer of weapons."" Elbit notably provides a significant portion of the drones used in Israeli ground operations. The French defence equipment company, Thales, they also highlight, maintains business relationships with Israel.

Belgium is also blamed by the activists who claim the country and its governments hold a share in the responsibility. They express disappointment that, ""Belgium cannot credibly call for a ceasefire while simultaneously supporting the Israeli military industry.""

Posted: 7 March 2024 | Emily Budgen |

Thales Transport have been awarded the top accreditation for equity, diversity, and inclusion in the United Kingdom.

Thales Transport in the UK has been awarded the EW Group’s Diversity Development Standard (DDS) Silver accreditation, making it one of the first in the industry to solidify its commitment to fostering equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) within the rail sector.

The DDS accreditation sets rigorous standard for promoting EDI throughout all aspects of organisational operations, including recruitment, learning and development, and employee engagement. By meeting these standards, Thales reaffirms its dedication to creating a workplace environment that celebrates diversity and empowers all to thrive.

Thales Transport in the UK embarked on its EDI journey in 2022, when it engaged the EW Group to help assess its existing EDI policies and initiatives. Since then, Thales has partnered with the EW Group to review policies, procedures and documentation, as well as conduct focus groups with staff, to help identify areas of enhancement.

The findings of this independent assessment informed a series of new policies and decisions, such as revamped recruitment processes; the appointment of a new EDI lead to bring expertise and a fresh perspective to drive change; and the creation of dedicated employee resource groups (ERGs).

Following this significant milestone, Thales, a signatory of the Railway Industry Association’s EDI in Rail Charter, recognises that the Silver accreditation is a stepping stone on its EDI journey. As part of its continued evolution in this space, its sights are firmly set on attaining EW Group’s prestigious Gold accreditation in the future.

“As a leader of an increasingly diverse workforce, I have always believed that diversity is a necessity. Earning the EW Group’s Silver DDS accreditation is not just an achievement, it’s a starting point for building an inclusive organisation that empowers everyone to succeed. I am proud of our Social Value team who have demonstrated a meaningful, long-term commitment to fostering diversity through equity and inclusion across the board. I would also like to thank the EW Group who have helped us make phenomenal strides towards EDI excellence,” said Andy Bell, VP, Thales Transport in the UK.

“The Silver DDS status demonstrates the progress Thales has made, from creating Employee Resource Groups to enhancing our EDI policies. In addition, combining our EDI efforts with Social Value has enabled us to understand and break down potential barriers both internally, and within the local communities we work in. I look forward to taking what we’ve started to the next level in 2024,” said Eleanor Wase, Social Value and EDI Lead, Thales Transport in the UK.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9833118915557861}",positive,0.9833118915557861,1

One example of this is his creation of standardised tooling excel sheets which calculate pricing and use cases for tools, creating a Lean working environment. As an apprentice representative in the Early Careers Committee at Thales in the UK, Andrew has been a fundamental member of the Early Careers Team in Northern Ireland. He has been a guide and mentor for those who have joined the Thales Skills Academy in 2023.

Andrew has brought initiative and new thinking to the teams he has worked with across his rotations during the scheme. He is a highly valued team member with a hard work ethic and bright future here at Thales. Geraldine Irwin, Skills Academy Manager for Thales in Northern Ireland

Reaching new heights with Thales Alenia Space

Andrew joined Thales in 2021 and carried out his Level 2 Manufacturing qualifications before progressing to the Level 3 and specialising in the electrical field. He is the first apprentice in Belfast that has been given the opportunity to work with Thales Alenia Space (TAS), where he has been able to develop his knowledge and skillset in electrical assembly. For the final year of his apprenticeship, Andrew has been given the opportunity to challenge his skills and expand his experience working in the Manufacturing Engineering department for TAS projects. With his passion for mechanics, cars and computers, Andrew has gone from building Lego to working on looms - it is no surprise that he has excelled during his time at Thales, but a career in engineering was not always the plan that Andrew had in mind.

Career path journey

After leaving school, Andrew took up an accounting apprenticeship, before moving on to study at Queens University Belfast. Through the impact of Covid, he began to work in a care home where he was unsure what his next career step may be. Andrew was recommended an apprenticeship at Thales by a friend, and he decided to apply and was successful in getting the role.

Benefits of a Thales in the UK apprenticeship programme

Apprentices at Thales get essential on the job experience, whilst undergoing fully funded qualifications. The scheme allows for apprentices to explore different areas of Thales, before specialising in their chosen field and progressing along their career path.
