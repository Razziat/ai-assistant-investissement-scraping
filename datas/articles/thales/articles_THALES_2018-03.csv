Bangabandhu Satellite-1 at Cape Canaveral - Thales,"Fri, 30 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbmV3cy9iYW5nYWJhbmRodS1zYXRlbGxpdGUtMS1jYXBlLWNhbmF2ZXJhbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Bangabandhu Satellite-1 left Thales Alenia Space’s Cannes plant on March 28. After a layover in Boston on March 29, the satellite arrived at Cape Canaveral, safe and sound, on March 30. Built by Thales Alenia Space as prime contractor for the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC), the first ever communications satellite of Bangladesh ‘Bangabandhu Satellite-1’ will shortly be orbited by a SpaceX Falcon 9 launch vehicle.





Bangladesh’s first communications satellite



Bangabandhu Satellite-1 is designed to reduce the country’s digital divide by providing broadcast and communications services to rural areas, including direct-to-home TV broadcasting across the country and in surrounding regions.

Back in 11 November 2015, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Thales Alenia Space, Mr. Jean-Loïc Galle said, “This satellite, which carries the symbolic name of the father of the nation, Bangabandhu, is a major step forward for telecommunications in Bangladesh, and a fantastic driver of economic development and heightened recognition across Asia.”



Bangabandhu Satellite-1 will empower the economy of Bangladesh, and also generate job opportunities in the region. Thales Alenia Space is very proud of having built this historical satellite, which is eagerly awaited by the people of Bangladesh.





Technical characteristics and coverage zone



Built on the new-generation Spacebus 4000B2 platform from Thales Alenia Space, the satellite is fitted with 26 Ku-band and 14 C-band transponders. Its coverage area includes Bangladesh and surrounding regions. Positioned at 119.1° East, the system will provide Ku-band coverage for Bangladesh and its territorial waters in the Bay of Bengal, India, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, the Philippines and Indonesia. It will also provide C-band capacity for the entire region.

France's Thales to face charges in Zuma corruption case - Africa - RFI English,"Sat, 17 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJmaS5mci9lbi9hZnJpY2EvMjAxODAzMTctc291dGgtYWZyaWNhcy1mb3JtZXItbGVhZGVyLWphY29iLXp1bWEtZmFjZS1jb3JydXB0aW9uLWNoYXJnZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SOUTH AFRICA

Jacob Zuma is to face corruption charges over a four-billion-euro arms deal. And French company Thales could find itself in the dock with the former South African president.

The decision to charge Zuma, who faces 16 charges of fraud, corruption and racketeering relating to 783 cases during an arms acquisition 20 years ago, was announced by Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams who had previously protected Zuma from prosecution.

Last year a court ruled against a 2009 decision by prosecutors to drop the corruption charges against Zuma just months before he became president, laying the path to Friday's announcement.

State prosecutors previously justified dropping the case by saying that tapped phone calls between officials in then-president Thabo Mbeki's administration showed undue interference.

Zuma's criminal charges relate to an arms procurement deals struck by the government in the late 1990s and from which he is accused of profiting corruptly to the tune of four million rand (280,000 euros).

Zuma is accused of taking kickbacks from the four-billion-euro purchase of fighter jets, patrol boats and other arms, manufactured by five European firms, including British military equipment maker BAE Systems and French company Thales.

National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesman Luvuyo Mfaku confirmed to the AFP news agency that Thales would also face prosecution, alongside Zuma.

Thales declined to make any immediate comment.

No timeline has been set out as yet for the legal proceedings, RFI correspondent Jean Jacques Cornish in Pretoria said, but the former president could appeal the ruling on a number of grounds and argue that the decision is illegitimate.

Zuma resigned as president last month after the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party threatened to remove him from office.

His successor, Cyril Ramaphosa, has vowed to tackle corruption, admitting it was a major problem in the previous government.

"The Army radio that could work in cities, caves and tunnels - C4ISRNET","Thu, 01 Mar 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmM0aXNybmV0LmNvbS9jMi1jb21tcy8yMDE4LzAzLzAxL3RoZS1hcm15LXJhZGlvLXRoYXQtY291bGQtd29yay1pbi1jaXRpZXMtY2F2ZXMtYW5kLXR1bm5lbHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales has begun delivery on a $37 million order for a tactical radio that the Army says will significantly improve how soldiers communicate in the field.

The Army inked a contract in December for the company’s dual-channel AN/PRC-148C Improved Multiband Inter-Intra Team Radio (IMBITR), a two-pound handheld radio that provides voice and data capability for both the dismounted user and mounted vehicle configurations.

“This suite of radios will provide SFAB [security force assistance brigades] combat advisor teams with inter-team and reach back communications and data situational awareness capability as they perform their missions,” said Paul D. Mehney, a spokesman for U.S. Army Program Executive Office – Command, Control, Communications and Tactical.

The Army is trying to break through certain limitations in its Soldier Radio Waveform, or SRW, which is the present go-to format for tactical communications.

By its nature, SRW can only scale up for use by 30 or 40 individuals in a user group, said Gary Kidwell, Thales Defense & Security business development director. This in turn puts the squeeze on available spectra. Because a brigade operation may need dozens of SRW devices to support its operations, users may be limited to voice and a very small amount of data throughput.

This means a platoon might be able to convey basic location information, for example, but richer data including imagery and video wouldn’t make it through. That puts a crimp on ISR capabilities.

Thales in 2012 introduced its two-channel handheld for simultaneous connectivity to legacy networks as well as the SRW network. The company says it has put the device through five years of testing and feedback, including participation in Army’s Network Integration Evaluation, the Maneuver Fires Integration Exercise, and the Bold Quest coalition demonstration.

The Army now appears to see promise in this dual-channel approach. “Combat advising teams can use the radio suite to share position locational and situational understanding information, enable the ability to chat and send text information and also transmit images if needed,” Mehney said.

Thales says it has overcome some of the constraints around SRW by introducing a new wave form capability, TSM, developed by TrellisWare Technologies. By utilizing this approach, “the solution can now scale to 200-plus nodes per network, thus preventing the spectrum challenges that were associated with SRW, while also ensuring that the voice and data channel can further support position location information, chat functionality and streaming video,” Kidwell said.

Unlike the Soldier Radio Waveform, TSM uses a “Barrage Relay” technique as a means to push information across the network. This eliminates routing and thus minimizes network overhead. According to TrellisWare, the Barrage Relay approach allows for multiple video transmissions, faster position locations, and simplified configurations for grab-and-go deployments.

This has direct battlefield implications.

Sharing information more widely

With Barrage Relay, “the waveform allows users to operate in much more challenged environments. It means you can have larger networks that provide voice, video and data in all environments including urban environments, caves and tunnels, and in buildings,” Kidwell said.

Moreover, the wider user base should make it possible to share critical battlefield information more widely, giving warfighters greater insight into their surroundings and commanders better visibility into their troop disposition.

“In current environments, someone deployed with an SRW may only have 30 personnel in that network. I could only have visibility with 30 other users,” Kidwell said. “In this network I can have situational awareness of not just my platoon but my entire battalion or brigade. Now I have the ability to digitally communicate with them and pass on critical mission data.”

As a dual-channel device, the IMBITR also helps the Army to overcome a key migration challenge. Military leaders want to move away from more limited legacy solutions, but need to do so in such as way as to ensure that those with older devices can still talk to troops equipped with upgraded radios.

By embracing a dual-channel approach, the service can move away from the constrained SRW environment while still enabling connectivity as newer devices as phased in across user groups.

“It’s all about enabling that end user to make critical decisions in real time,” Kidwell said."

I was fortunate to be offered a position as a Graduate Trainee when I graduated in July 2016 and I am in this positon now for just over one and a half years.





I am always very grateful that Thales offered this position for me as a Graduate Trainee. I think this is a great opportunity for me as it offers me a chance to rotate through different major business departments which makes me have a better exposure of the business and know how each function works. It enables me to have both career and personal development and pave the way for my future success.



Looking back, at this stage, I think the guidance and experience shared with me by my mentors and department heads have been the real highlights of my career so far. I am fortunate in that I have had the opportunity early on to work closely with different members of our executive management team. Every single of them have different areas of excellence, leadership style and background which definitely shapes a better me and beef up my ability.





One of the major challenges in my role today is, I think, that there are different challenges for me in every single day of work. Currently, I am working under Corporate Affairs/ Government Affairs in China which I think it is quite a big challenge.

Firstly, I am quickly learning about the Corporate Affairs/ Government Affairs function and how it relates to business. Secondly, Hong Kong has a particular language style and working style, when compared to that of China, and I see that for me especially, as I am not a native speaker of Mandarin. Sometimes I misunderstood a sentence here or there, and I am getting to learn the new jargon or dialogue, however, leaning a new culture is an amazing experience. But, I am thankful for those challenges because this has helped me grow and I learnt a lot more.



In the Short-team, After the current attachment in Corporation Affairs/ Government Affairs in China, I will next rotate to the legal department to learn about contract management and gain some fundamental concepts about contract law and business law.

The duration of the Graduate Trainee programme plan lasts for 2 years and will come to an end very soon, so I’m now looking to the longer term. I do feel very blessed that I have had this valuable opportunity to rotate through different departments, and learn a lot which totally broaden my horizon and enrich my knowledge. I think a position that matches my extrovert nature will suit me well in the future.

I think women should consider starting a career in Thales because Thales is a multi-national company and there is a great opportunity for mobility with many job opportunities. In addition, I think the future is bright in Thales!

I think it is important to get more women in Thales because Men and Women are born to have different mindset and behavior therefore, having more women working in Thales may bring up more constructive dialogue and identify improvements, hence a better and comprehensive solution could be provided to our customers - and benefit the company. A more diverse workforce brings a more productive one. I believe that females can succeed just as well as our male counterparts!



And, a diversity of workforce means more qualified employees are welcomed regardless of gender, nationality and background and it fosters a more creative and innovative workplace that I think it is important to retain talented employees for the company to be more competitive one."
Thales to Provide Next-Generation Rail Traffic Management System to... - railway-news.com,"Mon, 19 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vcmFpbHdheS1uZXdzLmNvbS90aGFsZXMtbmV4dC1nZW5lcmF0aW9uLXJhaWwtdHJhZmZpYy1tYW5hZ2VtZW50LXN5c3RlbS1ub3J3YXkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales to Provide Next-Generation Rail Traffic Management System to Norway

Norway has big ambitions for its railways. The Norwegian national rail administration Bane NOR is planning the procurement of a new signalling system based on the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) standard. The goal is to renew most of the existing signalling systems on the railway network by 2034. The project includes signalling systems, onboard equipment and a national rail Traffic Management System (TMS).

The modernisation programme will increase the attractiveness of rail travel through improved passenger service as well as delivering environmental, social and economic benefits to Norwegian society today and tomorrow.

Next-Generation Rail Traffic Management System

Bane NOR´s ambition is to have the world’s best TMS system. Thales is providing a next-generation solution based on the ARAMIS traffic management system, which will leverage the full potential of the modernisation programme to improve train punctuality, passengers safety and comfort and facilitate the mobility of people, goods and ideas throughout the country. It will accommodate a growing and evolving network to contribute to Norway’s further economic development and digitalisation.

The digitalisation programme includes early deployment of a country-wide rail Traffic Management System (TMS) that will replace three existing systems. A state-of-the-art management system is crucial to help railways operators make the most of their infrastructure, deploy more trains on the existing network and deliver an efficient, high-capacity railway system to improve train punctuality, enhance passenger safety and comfort and facilitate the mobility of people and freight throughout the country.

Cyber-Secured, Cloud Ready Platform

This major project will be rolled out over the next 17 years, and includes support, maintenance and cyber-security services. Norway will rely on Thales’s next-generation Traffic Management System, based on ARAMIS, a mature and reliable solution that manages more than 50,000 trains a day in 17 countries, including Germany, Austria, Portugal, Denmark and the UK. Bane NOR will benefit from a proven and scalable TMS solution combined with a next-generation platform able to adapt to a growing and evolving network that can meet Norway’s needs for the next 25 years. The next-generation solution has been substantially enhanced to provide a cyber-secured, cloud-ready platform with a fully adapted Human Machine Interface. The Thales TMS will have an interface with the existing systems during the migration period, ensuring a smooth transition to the new system.

Millar Crawford, Thales EVP for transportation systems, said:

“Thales is pleased to be chosen as the supplier of the key component in the digitalisation of the Norwegian railway. As a driving force of digitalisation, Thales is grateful to help Bane NOR fulfil their mission. This investment is a significant and important step towards a Norwegian railway revolution.”

ERTMS

The European Railway Traffic Management System (ERTMS) aims at replacing the different national train control and command systems in Europe, to enable the creation of a seamless European railway system and increase the competitiveness of European railways. Norway has committed to the implementation of ERTMS on its national railway network and the deployment of a new signalling system by 2034. The renewal project is also driven by the need to replace older signalling equipment that is harder to maintain and less reliable.

Thales in Norway

With a history dating 100 years back, Thales in Norway is a trusted partner in developing and delivering world leading secure and robust communication systems for extreme challenges. Thales employs more than 220 employees in Norway and is a leading technology supplier for public transportation, defence and security markets in Norway and internationally.

"Andreesen Horowitz's first space investment is an internet satellite, naturally - Quartz","Fri, 02 Mar 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vcXouY29tLzEyMjAwNzMvYXN0cmFuaXMtYW5kcmVlc2VuLWhvcm93aXR6cy1maXJzdC1zcGFjZS1pbnZlc3RtZW50LWlzLWFuLWludGVybmV0LXNhdGVsbGl0ZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The venture fund known for arguing that “software is eating the world” has taken a bite out of space with an $18 million investment in a satellite-builder called Astranis.

The company has developed an small, low-cost satellite design to provide internet connectivity from geostationary orbit, a very high altitude where satellites remain in place over one part of the earth. Having tested a prototype in low-earth orbit earlier this year, Astranis will use its new funds to build a full-fledged satellite with several gigabits of capacity and launch it next year.

The team is emblematic of the new space industry: One co-founder, John Gedmark, helped set up the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, a trade group for boosting private space activity; the other, Ryan McLinko, was an engineer at Planet, the earth imaging company at the forefront of the boom in small satellite investment.

Data from Preqin, which tracks venture capital deals, shows growing investment into an industry that was once limited to incumbent firms, mostly government contractors.

Silicon Valley investors are increasingly attracted to the argument that advances in electronics miniaturization, batteries, and antennae technology will combine with the world’s insatiable desire for connectivity and data to make formerly risky business plans in space appealing.

“Think about the amount of work it took to connect the first 3.5 billion [people to the internet,]” says Martin Casado, the Andreesen Horowitz partner who led the investment and will join Astranis’ board. “I think that’s the order of magnitude we’re talking when it comes to connecting the next three billion…even chipping away ten percent of that problem, five percent of the problem, is a $10 billion-plus company.”

Casado, who developed an important software networking protocol as a Stanford graduate student and became an executive at VMware before joining Andreesen Horowitz, sees similarities between his early work and Astranis. Each seeks to profit by giving larger network operators the tools to execute for their customers.

“We’re putting up infrastructure here, and these are pipes, and they can be used for a whole wide array of applications,” Gedmark tells Quartz.

The CEO says one advantage is his satellite’s use of software-defined radio, which allows it to be reprogrammed to operate efficiently on many different radio frequencies. This will help Astranis with a key challenge: It doesn’t have rights to operate their satellites on any existing frequencies, and has yet to announce any specific telecom partners.

Unlike other satellite internet plays, whether from more established companies like ViaSat, which just announced 100 mbps internet service from a new, high-capacity satellite, or bolder efforts like SpaceX’s plans to launch a huge new satellite constellation, Astranis is not seeking to operate its own satellites. Instead, Gedmark aims to sell them to existing satellite telecoms as smaller, cheaper substitutes for older satellites that might cost hundreds of millions to build and insure.

Satellite operators already pay tens of millions of dollars just to reserve space in geostationary orbit to send and receive radio signals. That’s one reason they spend a lot on their flying computers: So they can be sure of reliable return on those investments. That can create a vicious cycle, however, where companies may have orbital rights but lack the capital to make use of it before their access expires. Casado sees an opportunity in that dynamic.

“There’s a tremendous amount of demand to put satellites up in an area to use the spectrum that’s starting to time out,” Casado said, making this “a very opportunistic time for [Astranis] to engage those spectrum holders.”

Tim Farrar, a satellite industry consultant, says the idea has merit. “This is a good reason for Astranis to be frequency agile,” he tells Quartz. “An initial business plan might in fact be to offer to hold slots for satellite operators until they can build their bigger, more capable satellites that can make better use of the scarce spectrum rights in GEO.”

The other question about Astranis’s business plan comes from their emphasis on the ultra-high stationary orbit, more than 35,000 kilometers above the earth. The sheer physical distance—almost equal to a trip around the world—means higher latency and worse service for interactive applications like video chat or gaming. That’s one reason why SpaceX and OneWeb, another new satellite telecom firm, are betting on large constellations flying no more than 1,400 kilometers above the planet to deliver the fastest possible service.

Each plan comes with trade-offs: The low-flying constellations require bigger capital investments and more complicated technology to handle network traffic between fast-moving orbital computers. Astranis, Casado says, is “a nice solution poised between two extremes”—the expensive technology proposed by SpaceX and its competitors, and the legacy satellites operated by most space telecoms."

A month ago, ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli kicked off his post-#VITA mission tour of Italy with a visit to Italian President Sergio Mattarella. Today, our old friend Paolo dropped in to see his buddies at Thales Alenia Space in Turin. It’s a real pleasure to see Paolo again, and we can say that he’s in just as good shape as ever!

That’s a wrap: space takeout with pizza and ice cream was ok, but we know the space diet was tough on an Italian

Unstoppable Paolo!



#VITA was Paolo’s third long-duration mission. He completed more than 60 experiments during #VITA, which stands for Vitality, Innovation, Technology and Ability. One of the experiments was ARAMIS: “Augmented Reality Application for Maintenance, Inventory and Stowage”. Working for the Italian space agency, Thales Alenia Space led the ARAMIS project, which uses wireless and augmented reality technologies to assist ISS astronauts on maintenance and inspection operations, as well as the reorganization of onboard stowage. He also tested PERSEO (PErsonal Radiation Shielding for interplanetary missiOns), a new shield from Thales Alenia Space to protect astronauts against cosmic radiation – one of the main dangers on long missions. This suit is filled with water to protect our delicate organs.

Paolo’s visit also reawakened our memories from several years ago, when the STS-120 Mission Specialist stepped out of the International Space Station to take part in a six and a half hour spacewalk, or EVA (Extra Vehicular Activity). His task was to install the Thales Alenia Space-built Node 2 module, also known as Harmony, a major building block in further expansion of the ISS.

Paolo is shown below with crew members from ISS Expedition 26 and Space Shuttle mission STS-133, inside another of our crown jewels, the Leonardo Permanent Multipurpose Module, after it was mated to the Earth-facing port of the Unity node from the cargo bay of Space Shuttle Discovery, which delivered the module to space on its last flight, STS-133.

Arrivederci Paolo!

I joined the company about a year and a half ago; before that, I was with Thales Services, as head of a Competence Center in eastern France. Today, I’m very involved in projects concerning Thales Alenia Space’s digital transformation and digital continuity, especially for the integration of new technologies in our production processes, such as virtual and augmented reality. Perhaps the most striking example is the use of augmented reality in our clean rooms where we assemble, integrate and test (AIT) satellites. Deploying augmented reality in these integration rooms will change the life of our operators.

What are you most proud of in your job?



Thales Alenia Space is prime contractor for a number of satellites in sectors as different as telecommunications, Earth observation, navigation, science, space exploration and orbital infrastructures. It’s a real privilege to be working in a company like ours. People are highly motivated. And there’s a real innovation-driven culture that irrigates all professions and programs. This culture, taken to the extreme, could be considered the driving force of the digital transformation now taking place in Thales Alenia Space. I’m proud to be working in this sector.

What would you describe at the highlight of your career so far?



When we started to deploy augmented reality in our clean rooms, in conjunction with other entities and countries. This technology harbors significant benefits for a satellite-maker. The production of a satellite requires a large of amount of information, coupled with strict procedures and seamless traceability. Ensuring information availability and flow should not prevent operators from carrying out their tasks. Before, operators spent a large part of their day tracking tasks to be accomplished, as well as moving around to find the right information. Augmented reality quickly became the method of choice to transmit information from our design departments, placing it directly in front of operators in the integration room. Using headsets, a digital tablet or projection systems, operators see a virtual image of the components and subassemblies exactly where they have to be assembled. All information needed for this task is concentrated in a single interface. By reducing operator movements inside the clean room, and eliminating repetitive tasks that don’t add value, augmented reality clearly helps reduce the time needed to make a satellite.





Is virtual reality already being used at Thales Alenia Space? Where?



Virtual reality has already been used at several of our production facilities, for different purposes: training, accessibility management, and the layout of spaces to be used for assembly, integration and testing of satellites. For example, it allowed us to take an immersive approach to visualizing the dimensions of our new StratobusTM project, an autonomous, multi-mission stratospheric airship. Virtual reality was also used in the clean rooms at our facility in Rome, to determine the best configuration for the assembly and integration of the next eight O3b satellites. The key advantage of any virtual reality solution is to quickly resolve all problems concerning operator access to equipment.





What are the three main qualities required in your job?

A team spirit and the ability to listen and provide a long-term vision.

Thales Alenia Space shipped today the broadband radiometer (BBR), a scientific instrument for the European Space Agency’s Earth Cloud Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) satellite mission. Designed and built by Thales Alenia Space in the United Kingdom, it was shipped to satellite prime contractor Airbus integration center in Friedrichshafen, Germany.

The EarthCARE mission, developed in co-operation with JAXA in Japan, will improve our understanding of the relationship between clouds, aerosols and radiation and their combined effects on the Earth’s climate system. This high-priority mission will enhance our understanding of the science behind climatology and weather prediction.

The broadband radiometer will measure both reflected solar flux and Earth thermal flux, taking measurements across the spectrum from ultraviolet to the far infrared. It comprises three telescopes, sophisticated calibration systems and specifically developed detectors to cover the entire spectrum. A significant design and engineering challenge, the BBR will set a new standard in satellite radiometry.



Thales Alenia Space’s engineers in the UK led the design, construction and testing of the BBR. Other British companies and universities made significant contributions to this instrument, including STFC RAL Space (telescope assembly), ESR (mechanism assembly) and SciSys (onboard software). The BBR is the first core optical Earth Observation instrument produced by a British team for an ESA mission for more than 20 years.

They’re used on geostationary telecom satellites based on the Spacebus NEO platform, as well as on many other spacecraft, including ExoMars, MTG, Rosetta and the Sentinel family of environmental monitoring satellites for Europe’s Copernicus program. I oversee the fabrication of these TWTAs, including quality, process compliance and on-time delivery. One important aspect of my job is to strike the best balance between the allocated human resources and our team’s objectives. I try to make sure that each team member is assigned a key role, while also achieving professional fulfillment. I see myself like the conductor of an orchestra, guiding virtuosos who play outstanding instruments to give us a beautiful symphony (laughs)!

What are you proudest of in your day to day work?

Being thanked by our customers. Knowing that they are satisfied, and that we accomplished our assigned task is the best possible reward. It’s really a team success, and I’m proud to be able to share this achievement with everybody in my team.





What would you say is your career highlight so far?



One of the highlights so far was the TWTA ramp-up action plan. To meet growing demand, in 2016 we ramped-up our production rate – from 10 EPCs delivered per year, to 10 deliveries in just 30 days! Among other changes, we multiplied our workforce 4-fold, from 10 operators to about 40. This ramp-up action plan was significant at many levels. What struck me most was the team spirit and synergy among everybody involved with TWTAs: scheduling, methods, quality assurance, testing, engineering and more. Everybody was present and accounted for, and even though it was a newly formed team, they were fully committed to seeing things through all the way to the end.





In three words, what are the main qualities required by your job?

Organization, dynamism and empathy.

Thales in anti-submarine warfare sonar trials with Royal Navy - Thales,"Tue, 20 Mar 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi91bml0ZWQta2luZ2RvbS9uZXdzL3RoYWxlcy1hbnRpLXN1Ym1hcmluZS13YXJmYXJlLXNvbmFyLXRyaWFscy1yb3lhbC1uYXZ50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales in anti-submarine warfare sonar trials with Royal Navy Sonar Share this article

Thales has been liaising with the Navy in recent trials to assess if investments made in submarine sonar systems could deliver additional benefits for frontline sailors in surface ships such as the Type 23.

Sonar 2076 is the Royal Navy’s major sonar platform on all submarines, while the Type 23 frigate anti-submarine warfare fleet is fitted with Sonar 2087. These powerful Thales sonar systems are recognised as cutting edge maritime sensors in their specialist fields.



What links these two sonars together is their software. Novus is the name for a collection of passive sonar algorithms and human computer interface developments already in service with 2076 on board UK submarines.

There is a high degree of commonality with the major sonar 2087 fitted to the Type 23 frigates, meaning that significant advantages reported in submarines can be trialled in surface ships.

Drawn from 2076, the software is ‘oven ready’ for 2087, with a high level of innovation in that it could be ‘fast to adopt’ if Novus benefits were deemed to warrant full funding for delivery into service or ‘fast to fail’ if only marginal.

Following the MOD’s investment in the deployment to the fleet of Sonar 2087 technical refresh, the Navy has been able to rapidly deploy Thales-developed trial software while in Australia.

This demonstrates a tangible step forward towards understanding the future requirement of sonars. It has also involved close liaison between Navy Command, Defence Equipment & Support and Thales.

During DSEi, the First Sea Lord, the Navy’s most senior operational officer, outlined a vision to look beyond the platforms, weapon systems, sensors and other technologies to keep the Royal Navy at the forefront of capability for decades to come.



S2087 is a world class sonar and has plenty of potential for development. This is one such opportunity that has been taken forward by the Maritime Capability and Ships Divisions here in Navy Command HQ, with the support of DE&S and industry. We will continue to look for others. Commander Richard Hutchings

Fleet Anti-Submarine Warfare Officer,

Maritime Capability Division

The Open Architecture, common to both sonars 2076 and 2087, is also the core of the new submarine sonar training facility (Venturer) recently opened at HM Naval Base Clyde.

The Thales-supplied Rapidly Reconfigurable Training Technology (RRTT) system has been designed so that it can easily be reconfigured to future upgrades to provide high fidelity hands on training. This will ensure that individual sonar operators train on the right configuration to support specific missions and boats.

Thales says that in time, it could easily be applied to other naval training, such as naval communications, anti-submarine warfare and mine countermeasures."
"Meet Laura Tosoratto, Digital Transformation referent for Observation, Exploration and Navigation activities - Thales","Thu, 08 Mar 2018 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGFsZXNncm91cC5jb20vZW4vd29ybGR3aWRlL3NwYWNlL25ld3MvbWVldC1sYXVyYS10b3NvcmF0dG8tZGlnaXRhbC10cmFuc2Zvcm1hdGlvbi1yZWZlcmVudC1vYnNlcnZhdGlvbi1leHBsb3JhdGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Can you please explain your job at Thales Alenia Space in Italy?



I’m the Referent for Digital Transformation regarding Earth Observation, Exploration and Navigation. Since Thales Alenia Space has started to “go digital”, I’m here to define the digital transformation plan and make sure we have all the necessary resources. Digital transformation is not just a trendy buzzword, it’s an imperative that we as a company need to embrace to keep pace with progress. It’s a change driven by technology, based on the introduction of robotics, artificial intelligence, big data, and other production technologies and methods, but above all it represents a change in our culture.



What are you most proud of in your day-to-day activity?



To be working for a space company! I’ve always loved science (and science fiction), and especially astrophysics and space. I feel like I have realized my childhood dream of seeing spaceships with super-smart computers and undiscovered planets. Moreover, I play an active role in boosting our technological capabilities. I started three years ago by developing software tools that use computer graphics and virtual reality to support AIT, and to test operational concepts involving our products. Now I have an even wider scope of responsibility, with the challenge of overseeing the digitalization process in OEN.



Which event in your career did you enjoy the most?

I’ve only been at Thales Alenia Space since 2015. Before that, I was a researcher for almost ten years at INFN (Research institute for Nuclear Physics) in Rome. I was a software developer in the APE group, dealing with supercomputers for complex theoretical physics calculations. In 2006 I worked on the development of a “compiler” for the current generation of supercomputers; at that time the supercomputer was called apeNEXT and it was as big as 14 refrigerators! A “compiler” is the software that translates computer programs from a human readable language (a programming language) into machine language (a series of bits). Programming a supercomputer without this kind of software is a hard job, almost impossible.



After months of work on my compiler, one day I managed to make it run properly, indicated by a single digit (zero) displayed on my screen. That meant I could program the supercomputer, I could talk with the machine! Science can be very moving, even when the outward sign is just a little digit.



In 3 words, what are the qualities required in your profession?

Initiative, perseverance, positivity.



Factory 4.0, Italian style!

Nuria Marti Boix. I’m an electronics engineer, in charge of the assembly, integration and testing of satellite components, instruments and subsystems.



Our Zurich facility is specialized in the development and production of high-performance opto-electronics instruments for Earth Observation satellites and has a significant expertise in free space optical communication systems. Thales Alenia Space in Switzerland has dedicated as well competencies regarding radiation monitors and photonics.



My own job involves the production of imaging spectrometers.

What’s an imaging spectrometer?



Let me take the example of the program I’m working on right now, namely MTG, the third generation of European climatology and weather satellites. The Meteosat Third Generation program will comprise six satellites in all, four imaging satellites and two atmospheric sounding satellites.



Each of the two sounding satellites will be fitted with an imaging spectrometer instrument built in Switzerland, giving them infrared, ultraviolet and visible imaging capabilities over Europe. With these instruments, we can deliver to our customer, the European Space Agency, unprecedented information on the presence of gases in the atmosphere and cloud properties. This is obviously a key to better understanding the impact of global warming, so we can act to safeguard the thin atmospheric layer that protects our planet as well as monitor the air quality.

What would you say is your career highlight to date?



On October 13, 2017, Sentinel-5P, an Earth Observation satellite from ESA, part of Europe’s Copernicus program, was successfully launched. The only instrument it carries is an imaging spectrometer designed to measure the quantities of ozone, methane, formaldehyde, aerosols, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the atmosphere. In other words, it collects invaluable information on air quality, the ozone layer and climatic phenomena. Thales Alenia Space in Switzerland made a major contribution to building this instrument; I had the chance to be part of the project team. For us, the successful launch was the culmination of our efforts. It’s a little like seeing a child you raised stand on his own two feet. It was a real moment of grace, combined with emotions and pride.
