Raul Jungmann, Brazil’s Minister of Defense, is visiting Thales Alenia Space’s plant in Cannes today, at the head of a delegation including senior civil servants from the country, along with the Chief Executives of the companies Telebras, Embraer Defense and Visiona.

The focal point of this visit is of course the dual use (civil and military) SGDC Geostationary Defense and Strategic Communications Satellite, now being integrated in Thales Alenia Space’s clean rooms. The launch is planned for March 2017 from the Guiana Space Center in French Guiana.

Thales Alenia Space signed the SGDC contract with Visiona (a joint venture between Embraer and Telebras) at the end of 2013. This program plays a key role in the Brazilian Space Agency’s space development plan, while also addressing the Ministry of Defense’s strategic requirements. It is designed to meet two main objectives: the implementation of a secure satellite communications system for the Brazilian armed forces and government; and support for the deployment of the National Broadband Plan (PNBL), coordinated by Telebras as operator, which aims to reduce the digital divide in the country. The SGDC program is an integral part of Brazil’s strategy to reinforce its independence and sovereignty.



The Brazilian Space Agency and Thales Alenia Space had also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) concerning an ambitious technology transfer plan, designed to support the development of Brazil’s own space program.



The Brazilian Minister of Defense is getting a close-up look at this win-win partnership today.

The SGDC satellite is now in final integration configuration. It passed the Pre-Shipment Review in October, and the satellite will be shipped from this plant to the launch site in February.

Thales Alenia Space has established a unit at the San José dos Campos technology park in Brazil, to work more closely with its local customers and partners.

It has met its skills transfer commitment, since over 30 Brazilians engineers have been trained in all space engineering techniques, supervised by the Thales Alenia Space program team.

An aluminum battery support panel made by the Brazilian company CENIC is already integrated on the SGDC satellite.

The company will enhance the system’s capability to outperform the most advanced underwater threats in an increasingly complex environment.

Thales will build on its local and international expertise to prepare for upgrades to the cylindrical array, flank array, and on-board processing on the submarines, to maintain Royal Australian Navy superiority in the region.

Thales will utilise some of the latest developments in underwater sensing to replace the Collins arrays, which have not been upgraded since first entering service in the mid-1990s.

“The [AIC] component … is worth in the order of $50 million.”

“The Collins class sonars have proven very effective over many years, and now we are preparing for the upgrade to ensure they remain at the forefront of sensing performance,” CEO Thales Australia Chris Jenkins said.

The integration work will be carried out at Thales’s underwater systems facility in Rydalmere, Western Sydney and will support the Commonwealth in the key decisions on the rollout program of sonar and wider Collins Class upgrades, which will be subject to final Government approval in 2018.

Defence Industry Minister Christopher Pyne said Australian industry will play a key role in delivering the capability.

“The Australian industry component of the contract to be led by Thales Australia is worth in the order of $50 million and will support around 50 Australian jobs in Sydney and Perth,” he said.

Thales will work with local industry to deliver the upgrades, for the six submarines integrating products from other Australian providers including Sonartech Atlas and L-3 Oceania into the solution.

In an internationally collaborative program, the Collins’ legacy cylindrical array will be replaced with a Modular Cylindrical Array (MCA) based on submarine technology developed by Thales teams in the UK. The existing flank array will be replaced by the latest generation flank array from Thales teams in France. Over 100 people across the company will be involved in the project.

The upgrade program follows the company’s 2012 contract with Defence to update the Collins’ on-board sonar hardware and electronics.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6450339555740356}",neutral,0.6450339555740356,0
Thales and Textron Systems successfully test Fury Guided Weapon Package - EDR Magazine,"Mon, 07 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmV1L3RoYWxlcy1hbmQtdGV4dHJvbi1zeXN0ZW1zLXN1Y2Nlc3NmdWxseS10ZXN0LWZ1cnktZ3VpZGVkLXdlYXBvbi1wYWNrYWdl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales and Textron Systems announced today the successful testing of the Fury® lightweight precision guided glide weapon from the Shadow® Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System (TUAS) against static vehicle targets. Produced with Textron Systems, the Fury is built on the technology used in the Lightweight Multirole Missile (LMM) and is the latest addition to the LMM family.

The Fury was tested from a Textron Systems’ Shadow TUAS at the U.S. Army’s Yuma Proving Ground in Ariz. in late April. During the testing, the Fury was released from 8,000 feet altitude, conducted a Global Positioning System (GPS) guided fly-out maneuver and transitioned to the Semi-Active Laser (SAL) guided terminal engagement, directly striking a static vehicle target.

The latest test was a significant incremental step in the weapon’s development. Fury offers proportionate effects in time-critical, network-centric Close Air Support and Armed ISTAR missions against both fixed and moving targets.

The Fury weapon uses a standard interface for a widely used launcher type. The weapon’s tri-mode fuzing – impact, height of burst and delay – further enables a single Fury to address a broad target set. The precision weapon Fury is guided by a GPS-aided inertial navigation unit system with a SAL Seeker terminal guidance capability. This enables the weapon to engage both stationary and moving targets within 1 meter accuracy, or fly to specific target coordinates.

Thales and Textron Systems began development of the Fury weapon system in 2014. The team utilizes their expertise in weapon systems, and sub component and system-level integration in major United States and United Kingdom weapon system programs in development of the system. The team will co-market and produce the system for US domestic and international markets.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.7453298568725586}",positive,0.7453298568725586,1
Berlin's new Metro control centre improves safety with Black Box KVM technology - Digital Security Magazine,"Mon, 07 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaWdpdGFsc2VjdXJpdHltYWdhemluZS5jb20vZW4vMjAxNi8xMS8wNy9lbC1udWV2by1jZW50cm8tZGUtY29udHJvbC1kZWwtbWV0cm8tZGUtYmVybGluLW1lam9yYS1sYS1zZWd1cmlkYWQtY29uLWxhLXRlY25vbG9naWEta3ZtLWRlLWJsYWNrLWJveC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Berlin's new Metro control centre improves safety with Black Box KVM technology

Designed by German subsidiary Thales, this communications provider, infrastructure and digital signage has provided its solutions to transmit and visualize video and image signals in this critical environment, after migrating from analogue to digital technology to improve traffic control and safety in the suburban German capital.

With 146 Km. lines and 173 Stations, Berlin's transport company (Bvg) operates the largest metro network in German-speaking countries. Currently, all underground rail traffic, which has more than 1.200 vehicles and use 1,5 millions of travelers every day, is managed from the new Friedrichsfelde control centre.

The management and safety specialist Thales, through its subsidiary in Germany, has been responsible for the planning and implementation of systems of this new nerve center 400 m2, where KVM technology has been used Black Box to transmit and view video signals and images.

The new facilities have been designed to set new standards in working conditions and digital transformation to meet future needs. A requirement of BVG was the use of fiber optics as, unlike CATx cabling, is immune to interference, especially when it comes to electromagnetic compatibility (Emc) and the problems related to grounding.

This project had to convert analogue systems (like VGA, among others) to digital systems (Dvi), that in addition to improving the quality of the images (and produce less visual fatigue in operators), make it easy for digital image transmission to be easily set up redundantly, eliminating system failures in an environment as critical as controlling local transport systems.

One of the advantages of this new control center over the old facilities is that the twenty-one computers are located forty meters away, in a cooled and safe room. ""This spatial separation from workstations using KVM technology offers many advantages,"" explains Richard Maraschi, Project Manager of Black Box-, as it increases the security and service life of computers and/or servers, in addition to providing greater flexibility, which greatly improves processes"".

Specifically,, the new hub has more than thirty DKM KVM extenders that facilitate the transmission of digital video signals with resolutions up to 2,048×1.152Q, including keyboard and mouse information. The content is distributed through 31 video lines to workstations and three huge videowalls, each configured with six screens, so that operators have a view of the entire Berlin Metro network, in order to easily monitor and control traffic

For Maraschi, ""the user experience is vital to determining the acceptance of a system and how it is used to work. Latencies times (frustrations) perceptible things seen in analog times are now history"". In addition, the deployment of the complete KVM structure was carried out quickly on-site by a single employee.

As Doris Fritz explains, project manager of Thales Germany's transport systems division, ""it was important to us that the deployed solution seamlessly interacted with heterogeneous systems from different manufacturers. Thanks to our experience with Black Box we had no problem making a decision when it comes to selecting a modern KVM system"".

In critical areas, such as public passenger transport, robustness and reliability of solutions are vital, two requirements that this supplier's solutions have been improving in its extensive experience in control and industrial stations.

""Potential failures are always a key factor in projects like this, where a disruption-free deployment is critical. In the case of BVG there were no service issues during deployment, and the migration took place without any restrictions on traffic"", Fritz says.

During the fourth Ministerial 2+2 dialogue with Indonesia on October 27, senior Australian defence industry officials signed a collaboration agreement to further develop a mine-resistant armoured vehicle which was launched at IndoDefence 2016 exhibition in Jakarta last week.

According to the official joint communique, issued by Australian Foreign and Defence Ministers Julie Bishop and Marise Payne and their Indonesian counterparts Retno Marsudi and Ryamizad Ryacudu, the design is based upon the Australian Bushmaster design developed by Thales Australia.

Thales and Indonesian armoured vehicle manufactruer PT Pindad will cooperate on the design, which would be customised for Indonesian Army (TNI) needs.

IHS Janes reported the vehicle, known as Sanca, would be produced in an initial batch of 50 once a contract which PT Pindad was negotiating with the Indonesian Ministry of Defence was finalised. A prototype of the vehicle was displayed at the exhibition.

The Sanca is based on the Thales Australia Bushmaster, and has been modified for Indonesian requirements. (IHS/Patrick Allen)

A Thales spokesperson said: “Thales collaborates closely with our partners in Indonesia in many areas and we are aware that Indonesia is in the process of developing mine-resistant armoured vehicles locally, based on the Bushmaster design. Thales is pleased to work closely with our local partners on vehicle specifications based on local needs"".

Minister Bishop said that the two countries would also work on increasing the number of joint maritime exercises and would consider the possibility of joint patrols in the South China Sea.

""We have agreed to explore options to increase maritime cooperation and of course that would include coordinated activities in the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea,"" she told the ABC.

The Ministers have also committed to elevating security cooperation in cyber security.

""In this regard, we welcome the convening of the Inaugural Indonesia-Australia Cyber Policy Dialogue in Australia at the earliest opportunity,"" they said in the joint communique.

Indonesian President Joko Widodo was forced to cancel his first official state visit to Australia this week after violent riots took place in Jakarta over the weekend.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999915361404419}",neutral,0.9999915361404419,0

The Hawkei vehicles were the first produced on the new production line at the Bendigo plant in Victoria where Thales also makes the 10-passenger Bushmaster troop carrier.

Defence industry minister Christopher Pyne said the Hawkei represented a triumph for the growing defence industry when the ninth and 10th vehicles were handed over last week.

“The Hawkei, built right here in Australia, in another triumph of the defence capability of our defence industry, which is able to compete with the world’s best,” Mr Pyne said.

The vehicle was fortunate to get into the procurement process as it was excluded from the initial list of preferred tenderers who received research and development funding.

The initial intention was for Australia to participate in a joint development program with the United States. Australia actually funded nine of the first 30 Joint Light Tactical Vehicle prototypes built in the program, which was created to replace the Humvee vehicle.

However, the program was delayed as the US Army changed the design criteria in 2011, increasing the levels of blast protection. Later that year the Australian department of defence named the Hawkei as the preferred vehicle.

Under the Project Land 121 Phase 4 contract, Thales will supply 1100 Hawkei vehicles and more than 1000 companion trailers.

Deliveries are scheduled to start in 2018 and be complete by 2021, during which time the Hawkei will be Australia’s highest-volume locally produced vehicle, at around 350 a year.

Mr Pyne said that Hawkei production would maintain around 170 jobs in the Bendigo region, with a further 60 jobs to be created in the supply chain when production commences. There will be further jobs created in Queensland, where the Army will establish a maintenance base.

“The vehicle represents an entirely new capability for the Army,” Mr Pyne said, “providing a similar level of protection to a Bushmaster at about half the weight.”

Weight was a key criterion in the specifications of the Protected Mobility Vehicle (Light) contract, otherwise known as Project Land 121 Phase 4. The vehicle had to weigh less than 7000kg so it could be airlifted by a Chinook helicopter.

The Hawkei can seat up to six including the driver whereas the Bushmaster can carry a driver and nine troops. Almost 1200 Bushmasters have been built, with the Dutch defence forces operating 98, Jamaica 12 and Japan four. It is believed the British armed forces also have some Bushmasters.

Its V-shaped steel under-body gives the occupants greater protection against blasts from improvised explosive devices while the body work gives improved ballistic protection.

The Hawkei is built in three modules, with the occupants in the centre survival cell. At the front, the engine and transmission are placed side by side to make for easier replacement and also to keep the cabin as roomy as possible.

It is powered by a Steyr 3.2 litre turbo-diesel producing 200kW/610Nm and weighing only 240kg. The transmission is a ZF six-speed automatic.

The rear module is also designed as a sacrificial section, the space-frame is capable of carrying a variety of bodywork and loads according to which variant the vehicle is: command, liaison, special operations, border protection or utility.

When the government declared that Thales had won the Land 121 Phase 4 contract, Thales Australia chief executive Chris Jenkins said the Hawkei had a strong future ahead of it and that the local arm would be assisted by the global Thales group in securing export sales.

“This is a great day for the ADF (Australian Defence Forces) and for Australian industry,” he said.

He said the Hawkei was a flexible vehicle and that there were already several variants. He said Thales would be ready to adapt it to any other requirements.

“We also thank our many suppliers on the program – companies in Australia and overseas that have been with us on this long journey, and who have played a significant role in shaping the Hawkei and contributing to its success,” Mr Jenkins said.

“It’s a great story about what Australian industry and international partnerships can achieve.

“As we move into the manufacturing phase, we will now be able to consolidate the work already begun across the Thales group worldwide to ensure the export success of this impressive vehicle.”

Australia’s Hawkei protected vehicle project hits major milestone - Australian Manufacturing,"Tue, 15 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nLmNvbS5hdS9hdXN0cmFsaWFzLWhhd2tlaS1wcm90ZWN0ZWQtdmVoaWNsZS1wcm9qZWN0LWhpdHMtbWFqb3ItbWlsZXN0b25lL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Australian Department of Defence has received the final two of an initial production run of ten 4×4 Hawkei light protected mobility vehicles in a ceremony witnessed by the Hon Christopher Pyne MP.

The vehicles were rolled off the Thales production line in Bendigo, which also produces the life-saving Bushmaster.

Mr Pyne said the handover of two new Hawkeis represented a major milestone in the military’s next generation Hawkei protected vehicle project and a triumph for Australia’s burgeoning defence industry.

“The Hawkei, built right here in Australia, is another triumph of the capability of our defence industry, which is able to compete with the world’s best,” Mr Pyne said.

“Hawkei production will involve about 170 jobs in the Bendigo region. It’s expected approximately 60 additional jobs will be created in Thales’ supply chain to support the production of the Hawkei vehicle.”

He said the vehicle will provide a similar level of protection to a Bushmaster at about half the weight.

“The Hawkei is a smaller vehicle that carries up to four troops and can be lifted by a Chinook helicopter,” the Minister pointed out, adding that the vehicles will perform reconnaissance, liaison, command and utility functions,” the Minister added.

“It will provide significantly improved protection for soldiers against blast and ballistic threats, with a high level of mobility that will allow it to operate in high-risk areas.”

Last year, the Department of Defence signed a $1.3 billion contract with Thales Australia to produce 1100 Hawkei vehicles and more than 1000 companion trailers.

Under the agreement, full scale production is expected to commence in 2018, with all Hawkeis and trailers to be delivered to the Australian Defence Force by late 2021.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.6353203654289246}",positive,0.6353203654289246,1
Indo Defence 2016 - EDR Magazine,"Tue, 08 Nov 2016 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmV1L2luZG8tZGVmZW5jZS0yMDE20gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Joseph Roukoz

As the seventh edition of Indonesia’s tri-service exposition and forum comes to a close, it can already be hailed as a great success. Well organised every two years by the Jakarta International Expo Kemayoran, it took place in the Indonesian capital from November 2nd to 5th 2016. Indo Defence exhibition hosted some 844 companies from 55 countries, with 30 pavilions including those of Germany, India, Italy, Australia, South Korea, France, Turkey, USA, UK, Russia, South Africa, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Belarus, Indonesia, Czech Republic, Ukraine and Slovakia, an increase of about 25 percent compared with the last edition according to the organisers.

The growing number of exhibitors on the Indo Defence 2016 roster is a true reflection of rising defence spending in the region with an annual compound growth rate of 4.7 per cent equating to a more than 20 billion US dollars expected to be spent on military and security procurement activities between now and 2025. This makes Indonesia the fifth fastest budget in the world, according to figures released by IHS Markit last October.

Dominating the show was the on-going medium tank competition pitting the German Rheinmetall Marder 1 against the against new Modern Medium Tank (MMWT) developed for the Indonesian Army by a joint-venture company involving FNSS in Turkey and PT Pindad in Indonesia that was unveiled at Indo Defence. The Marder 1 infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) was in production for the German Army between 1971 and 1975 and the latest 1A5 IFV will remain in service for some years to come and the company has already sold surplus upgraded Marder 1A3 IFVs to Chile and Indonesia, Two prototypes of the MMWT have been built to date but no final decision has yet been taken in Jakarta as to which model will win the competition at the end of the evaluation period.

The MMWT is fitted with a Belgian CMI Defence two-person turret armed with a 105mm rifled gun that is fed by a bustle-mounted automatic loader with a 7.62mm machine gun mounted co-axial with the main armament. The role of the MMWT is not to engage more heavily armed and protected main battle tanks (MBT) but to engage lighter threat vehicles such as reconnaissance platforms, IFVs, troop carriers and combat support vehicles.

France had its own pavilion at Indo Defence grouped under GICAT and COGES. A number of French companies such as ECA, offered its latest mine-detecting drones, or Verney Carron, provider of non-lethal security weapons like the FlashBall and Flash Compact or LG56 grenade launchers. Ouvry exhibited its latest CBRN protective clothing and Bollé a family of impact resistant tactical eye-wears. Defence Conseil Internationale was also under the French pavilion.

Nexter’s 105 LG1 light towed howitzer was one of the stars of the French exhibit in Jakarta. Deployable by light vehicle, helicopter or even by parachute, the 105 LG1 is the world’s lightest 105mm assault artillery gun, and is ideal for providing supporting fire for rapid reaction forces. The 105 LG1 is currently in service with the land forces of Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Belgium, Canada and Colombia.

Indonesia has already taken delivery of 20 105mm LG1 light Guns and Nexter Systems is hoping there will be a second contract for additional weapons in the not too distant future.

Nexter took the advantage of the show to exhibit a model of its self-propelled CAESAR 155mm/52-calibre howitzer. Already used in combat by the armed forces of France, both in Mali and Iraq, after early deployment in Afghanistan and Lebanon, it is today also in service in Thailand, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia.

The Indonesian Army programme to update its conventional artillery capability with the acquisition of new systems with greater range and accuracy, they are deployed with two regiments, each with 18 systems plus one for training.

Also showcased was FINDART, Nexter’s firing control system, and its range of artillery munitions and Nexter Robotics’ NERVA, a family of mini surveillance and reconnaissance robots. Light and easy to carry around and deploy, Nerva is a rugged remotely operated drone system, both waterproof and shock-resistant. Its versatile platform can easily accommodate about 25 specific modules adapted for a great variety of missions.

While Dassault Aviation had only a modest presence at the show with a model of the Rafale exhibited in the Thales booth, this last company showcased many interesting pieces of equipment. Namely the Monie and Lucie night vision cameras (operating in the 3.5 µ band), land tactical radios, both hand-held and vehicle-mounted, the new TALTICOS combat management system (CMS), already in use in the Indonesian navy. A novel variant of the Thales STARStreak missile was shown with the improved performance ELMM laser proximity fuse. Today installed on the Indonesian armed forces IPTN/Airbus CN235 MPA, Thales’ Amascos combines a powerful tactical command subsystem with the latest-generation sensor suites to ensure the success of maritime patrol and surveillance missions and now benefits from new and lighter work consoles that are particularly well adapted for operations with the latest versions of the Searchmaster multifunction radar.

Airbus attended the show with models of the A400M and C295 transports and an H225M helicopter, all of which it is hoped that the company will find additional customers in Asia. Malaysia already flies the A400M strategic transport and Thailand is one of the most recent customers of the H225M Caracal. Another of Airbus aircraft was present at the show, this time in the Indonesian hall. Production of the Airbus Military C212 light transport was transferred to Indonesia in mid-2013, after the company teamed with PT Dirgantara Indonesia (PTDI) in 2011. The last C212 to be assembled in Spain was delivered to the Vietnam Marine Police in late 2013. A total of 477 C212s have been produced over a 42-year period for 92 operators. They have been used in a “variety of roles ranging from transport to rain-making, and surveillance to search and rescue,” according to the manufacturer. Today, less than 300 C212s are flying in 40 countries, the largest share (with 70 aircraft) being in Indonesia, where predecessors to PTDI (IPTN and AI) assembled the type under license at Bandung during the 1970s and 1980s. This Indonesian state-owned manufacturing company has been regularly supplying sub-assemblies for the CN235 to Airbus Military. Today it builds the NC-212, a further upgrade of the earlier C212-400, introduced in 1997 with a glass cockpit and more powerful Honeywell TPE331 engines. The NC212 is one of the very few modern light cargo aircraft able to compete with Chinese or Russian products.
