"Thales Develops a New Generation Laser Designation Pod for Rafale, Mirage 2000 - Defense Update","Fri, 17 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5zZS11cGRhdGUuY29tLzIwMTQwMTE3X3RoYWxlcy1sYXNlci1kZXNpZ25hdGlvbi1wb2QuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The French defence procurement agency DGA has awarded Thales with a contract for the development of a New Generation Laser Designation Pod (PDL NG). The contract follows the completion the risk reduction phase Thales has followed through 2013. The development is expected to continue for five years, with initial series production pods expected in 2018.

The PDL NG will provide French Air Forces fighter planes an improved day/night imaging capability, enhancing target engagement capabilities in complex theaters of operations. The new pod will be designed to integrate with both the Rafale and Mirage 2000D fighter aircraft.

The risk-reduction phase, the first step in the development of any programme, confirmed the system’s architecture, its high level of functional integration, reliability and the development schedule."
Thales wins East Japan Railway CBTC contract | News - Railway Gazette,"Wed, 08 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWx3YXlnYXpldHRlLmNvbS9pbmZyYXN0cnVjdHVyZS90aGFsZXMtd2lucy1lYXN0LWphcGFuLXJhaWx3YXktY2J0Yy1jb250cmFjdC8zOTA1My5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"JAPAN: East Japan Railway has selected Thales as preferred bidder for a contract to design a communications-based train control system for Joban Local Line in the greater Tokyo area. The scope includes 14 stations on the 29·7 km Ayase - Toride route, along with 70 trainsets.

Subject to a final contract being agreed, Thales will undertake design work which is expected to take about a year. If JR East then determines that the proposed system would meet its requirements, Thales would be asked to supply and install CBTC to go live around 2020.

The CBTC installation would then be compared with the domestic Advanced Train Administration & Communications System which JR East has piloted on its Senseki Line and is to be deployed on the 37 km Saikyo Line between Ikebukuro and Omiya by late 2017.

'With this contract Thales becomes the first non-Japanese company to enter the Japanese signalling market, via the city of Tokyo, home to the world's busiest railway network', said Jean-Louis Moraud, Country Director of Thales in Japan, on January 8. 'Thales is pleased to bring its latest signalling technology and experience in urban rail systems modernisation to a country that already benefits from great advances in the transport sector.'

Thales said its CBTC has been proven on more than 55 projects covering more than 1 300 track-km carrying 3 billion passengers/year in cities worldwide.

JR East had received 10 expressions of interest in the CBTC trial contract, before shortlisting Alstom and Thales in February 2013. The project forms part of JR East's plans to replace its life-expired automatic train control with more modern technology offering shorter headways, higher capacity and improved life-cycle costs, with less lineside cabling and fewer skilled maintenance staff needed.

French Foreign Trade Minister Nicole Bricq said the selection of Thales was 'a sign of opening up on the part of the Japanese authorities which I must welcome', following moves by the French government to ensure that the start of negotiations on a free trade agreement between Europe and Japan were accompanied by 'real measures' to make the Japanese market more accessible."
JR East selects Thales to design first Japanese CBTC - International Railway Journal,"Wed, 08 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWxqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9zaWduYWxsaW5nL2pyLWVhc3Qtc2VsZWN0cy10aGFsZXMtdG8tZGVzaWduLWZpcnN0LWphcGFuZXNlLWNidGMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales will design the CBTC system for installation on the Joban suburban line in Tokyo which links Ayase with Toride. The 30km line, which has 14 stations, is operated by a fleet of 70 trains. The line currently has a conventional automatic train control system.

The main objective is to improve reliability and reduce costs by eliminating track circuits and reducing the amount of cabling while enabling bi-directional operation. JR East said when it announced the competition in February 2013 that it wants to ""drastically change and improve"" its Tokyo suburban network through ""innovations that incorporate a conceptual breakthrough and are completely free from conventional ways of thinking."""

Army of Indonesia orders Thales ForceSHIELD air defense system with STARStreak missiles 1501141 | January 2014 ... - Army Recognition,"Wed, 15 Jan 2014 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFodHRwczovL2FybXlyZWNvZ25pdGlvbi5jb20vamFudWFyeV8yMDE0X2dsb2JhbF9kZWZlbnNlX3NlY3VyaXR5X25ld3NfaW5kdXN0cnkvYXJteV9vZl9pbmRvbmVzaWFfb3JkZXJzX3RoYWxlc19mb3JjZXNoaWVsZF9haXJfZGVmZW5zZV9zeXN0ZW1fd2l0aF9zdGFyc3RyZWFrX21pc3NpbGVzXzE1MDExNDEuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Victor Chavez, CEO of Thales UK, said: “Thales is the only European defence contractor with the in-depth knowledge and range of advanced technologies to deliver a leading-edge integrated air defence solution such as ForceSHIELD. This solution for the Indonesian Army marks a new approach to air defence in that it provides a complete turnkey solution comprising latest-generation ‘sensor to effects’ technologies. I would like to express my gratitude to the Prime Minister for his personal support on this project and the support of the government – it makes a huge difference to industry and our customers.” For the realisation of this programme, Thales will increase its existing industrial cooperation with the Republic of Indonesia, and has signed an agreement with the Indonesian company PT LEN Industri. The Group will continue to develop a long-term partnership with the Indonesian industry on future programmes in both the military and civil sectors.

Thales’s ForceSHIELD solution is based on customising and combining a range of product lines such as radars, communications, engagement and fire control systems, launchers and missiles to meet front-line users’ needs. This approach provides highly-effective capabilities for its customers to meet the increasing array of asymmetric and conventional air threats in today’s security environment.



The CONTROLMaster200 comprises the latest generation solid-state radar, capable of detecting and tracking 200 targets simultaneously out to ranges up to 250km. It incorporates the CONTROLView engagement control system that evaluates threats, assigns weapons, and coordinates combat management activity – enabling complex and critical decisions to be made faster and with greater precision and security.



The RAPIDRanger is a unique lightweight vehicle-based launcher and fire control system, which can be integrated into a network-enabled force structure and coordinated with a variety of Command and Control systems. Equipped with the STARStreak high-velocity missile, RAPIDRanger has the ability to defeat a wide variety of air threats, including ground attack aircraft, pop-up Attack Helicopters, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and cruise missiles. The STARStreak missile operates at a speed in excess of Mach 3 to defeat fast-moving threats and those with short unmasking times. The three-dart ‘hittile’ configuration maximises lethality and the highly-accurate laser beam riding guidance enables engagement of low-signature targets and is immune to all known countermeasures."
