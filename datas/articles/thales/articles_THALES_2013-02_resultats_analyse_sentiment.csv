Successful flight trials for Thales I-Master on Schiebel Camcopter S-100 - sUAS News,"Tue, 19 Feb 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1YXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDEzLzAyL3N1Y2Nlc3NmdWwtZmxpZ2h0LXRyaWFscy1mb3ItdGhhbGVzLWktbWFzdGVyLW9uLXNjaGllYmVsLWNhbWNvcHRlci1zLTEwMC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Successful flight trials for Thales I-Master on Schiebel Camcopter S-100

Vienna, 19 February 2013 – Thales’ I-Master radar system has successfully completed flight trials on-board a Schiebel CAMCOPTER® S-100 UAS (Unmanned Air System). The flight trials on CAMCOPTER® S-100 took place on 7 February 2013 at the Schiebel test facility in Wiener Neustadt, Austria. The flights, each lasting several hours, successfully proved both sensor performance and the stability of data transfer between radar operator and the airborne I-Master.

I-Master is a high-performance radar, providing Ground Moving Target Indication (GMTI) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) capability for all-weather surveillance, detection and recognition of targets over large areas at long stand-off ranges. Schiebel’s CAMCOPTER® S-100 is a proven Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) rotary wing UAS capable of carrying a wide range of sensors for military and civilian applications. Eddie Awang, Vice President of Intelligence Surveillance & Reconnaissance at Thales UK, said, “This trial, conducted in partnership with Schiebel, provided excellent GMTI and SAR results. It shows that I-Master can operate successfully on this VTOL UAV, meeting the specific challenges of unmanned platforms without interference or operational impact.

I-Master has again proven its world-leading credentials. It provides the best performance in its class, in a flexible adaptable package, bringing a high-end capability to more customers around the world – fixed wing aircraft and UAVs, helicopters, and now the Schiebel CAMCOPTER® S-100. Whether installed alone or to complement electro-optical/infrared sensors, I-Master greatly improves the effectiveness of any surveillance scenario.”

Hans Georg Schiebel, the Schiebel Group’s chairman said “The I-Master radar integrated easily to CAMCOPTER® S-100, proving the flexibility of both the UAV and the radar. With the I-Master installed, the system performed even above our high expectations and provides invaluable surveillance, detection and recognition capability.”

Weighing only 30 kg, I-Master has been designed for easy installation with ‘plug & play’ integration. It is designed with the same footprint as a standard 15’’ EO/IR sensor turret, allowing simple air worthiness and certification.

The CAMCOPTER® S-100 equipped with I-Master, provides high-fidelity imagery for classification and positioning of various targets through 360º and can accurately detect and locate moving targets, from fast moving vehicles to individuals at walking pace. This

provides an effective asset in operations such as homeland security, border surveillance pipeline security and incident management.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999984502792358}",positive,0.9999984502792358,1

UK explores TV transmitter option to track aircraft - Phys.org,"Wed, 13 Feb 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDEzLTAyLXVrLWV4cGxvcmVzLXR2LXRyYW5zbWl0dGVyLW9wdGlvbi5odG1s0gFDaHR0cHM6Ly9waHlzLm9yZy9uZXdzLzIwMTMtMDItdWstZXhwbG9yZXMtdHYtdHJhbnNtaXR0ZXItb3B0aW9uLmFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Credit: Magnus Rosendahl, Public-domain-photos.com

(Phys.org)—UK's Technology Strategy Board, a government agency looking for innovative ways of using technology, is funding research into a new way of locating and tracking aircraft. The research project is calling upon Thales, which is to explore the use of TV signals to locate and track aircraft. The project could possibly bear impact on the future of air traffic control, as an improvement to current airport radar systems. The Thales effort is a two-year project to investigate how the current system can be overhauled.

""Multi-static primary surveillance radar,"" as the concept is known, involves harnessing television transmitters all around the UK. According to Airport International, the air traffic control plan in mind would harness this transmission infrastructure in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Signals would be sent to each transmitter but the receipt times would vary, and the differences between signals broadcast and signals received could determine the location of an aircraft.

According to the BBC, Thales sees one advantage in drawing upon the large number of TV transmitters as providing a more reliable infrastructure than the current one. The other benefit of having an air traffic control system based on TV signals would involve spectrum: The spectrum used by airport traffic control services could be reallocated. Those who would benefit would be next-generation mobile service groups. This translates into more spectrum to accommodate 5G mobile phone technology.

Last year, it was made known that, minding the need for more mobile spectrum in a post-4G environment, Ofcom, the UK telecoms regulator, was looking to avert the risk of a capacity crunch in mobile data. The concern was that, as people consume more bandwidth on mobile devices, attention had to focus on how the mobile infrastructure in the UK can continue to support growth in consumer demand. Ofcom has reckoned that, by 2030, demand for mobile data could be 80 times higher than today. At the time, they said that an estimated 20 million Gigabytes of data was consumed per month over mobile networks in the UK, a dramatic increase from the monthly consumption rate in the previous year.

As for the current radar project, Thales Air Traffic Management chief John Smith commenting to the BBC, said, ""We have to prove, first and foremost, that it is safe.""

(BEL) for this program, and the Israeli Litening, the latest version of the targeting pod developed by RAFAEL. According to company officials, the Litening pods being offered are superior in technological terms. RAFAEL and Lockheed Martin are often competing targeting pod procurements worldwide as their products – Litening and Sniper are similar in capabilities and performance. In India, however, the US company remained out of the competition for unexplained reasons.

India is already operating previous generations of Litening on its fighter planes and RAFAEL has sourced Indian subcontractor significant contracts for the supply of subsystems and services for these products.

Both companies have passed the technical selection and are expected to demonstrate their pods in upcoming months. Selection of the Lowest Bidder (L1) will follow later this year (2013).

While the teaming Thales has struck with BEL positions it as a favorite supplier for MMRCA and Mirage 2000 upgrades, the advantages of commonality with existing and new targeting pods is not ignored by the IAF, even if it is not part of the parameters to be considered for the selection. Thales recently announced it is embarking on an improvement of its Damocles pod, a step likely to assist its product offering in India as well.

According to RAFAEL, the Litening pods deployed with the IAF could be upgraded to the same level as the new pods, bringing the total inventory of targeting pods to more than 200, all would be interchangeable between all strike aircraft configured to carry targeting pods. These aircraft could also carry our recce missions, using the RECCELITE pod that has recently become operational with the IAF.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.991329550743103}",positive,0.991329550743103,1

Mac Maharaj: The 'foul secret' that has torn sister from sister – The Mail & Guardian - Mail and Guardian,"Fri, 01 Feb 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vbWcuY28uemEvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDEzLTAyLTAxLTAwLW1hYy1tYWhhcmFqLXRoZS1mb3VsLXNlY3JldC10aGF0LWhhcy10b3JuLXNpc3Rlci1mcm9tLXNpc3Rlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On SAFM

New evidence has emerged to support the claim that Mac ­Maharaj and his wife, Zarina, took kickbacks on a 1990s contract for new drivers' licences – and it comes from the heart of the presidential spokesperson's family: Zarina's sister, who has chosen to go public with what she says is her knowledge of the origins of the Swiss account into which the money was paid.

The payments, in 1996, flowed allegedly from a subsidiary of French multinational Thales, via a Swiss account controlled by Schabir Shaik, to an adjacent account opened by Zarina Maharaj.

Shirene Carim: In her own words

Maharaj's lawyer Rudi Krause and Schabir Shaik's repsonses

Shaik's dealings with Thales are best known from his corruption conviction in part for facilitating an agreement for the company to pay Jacob Zuma in return for his ""protection and support"" as the arms deal scandal broke.

During 1996, however, Thales subsidiary IDMatics was in a consortium with Shaik, bidding for the contract to produce the new credit card-style drivers' licences. Mac Maharaj was minister of transport at the time and Zarina's sister, Shirene Carim, an uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) veteran, was living in London.

Maharaj has always refused to answer media questions about the payments. And when the Mail & Guardian sought to publish details of an in-camera interview under oath with the Scorpions in which he gave answers at odds with the facts, he laid a criminal complaint. He is also opposing a court application for permission to publish details of the interview.

Now, in a move that appears driven in equal measure by courage and bitterness, anger and principle, Shirene Carim has come forward to recount the details of Zarina's trip to Geneva in October 1996 to open a Swiss account and to lay bare what she knew about Shaik's involvement.

The existence of the bank account has been known for some time, but Carim has provided fresh details corroborating the forensic record and adding her view of the attitude of the Maharajs at the time.

Documents obtained by the Scorpions during its investigation of Maharaj showed that Zarina opened an account with Banque SCS Alliance in Geneva on October 14 1996. It was into this account that more than $210 000 was transferred, cash which originated from Thales subsidiary IDMatics.

Case withdrawn

The Scorpions case against Maharaj was withdrawn in 2009 by acting National Director of Public Prosecutions Mokotedi Mpshe for reasons that remain unexplained.

Shirene Carim, who served with MK's special operations division from 1984 to 1987, took the initiative to contact the M&G during a visit to South Africa from her home in London.

She told the M&G she struggled with the decision to make disclosures that would brand her as disloyal to her family and forever cement the rift with her elder sister and possibly the wider family.

But it is also evident that Zarina's alleged disclosure to her sister that she was going to Geneva to open a bank account to receive money from Shaik injected a poisonous secret into their already difficult relationship from which it never recovered.

Shirene set out the allegations in an initial email to the M&G Centre for Investigative Journalism without at first disclosing her identity.

""I'd hoped that by now, justice would prevail.

""In 1996 or 1997, Mac's wife stayed with me in London UK on her way to Geneva to open a bank account, as she could only have been boasting to me.

'In shock'

""I was given the details of the provider of the funds – Shaik – and the reason why. I was in shock until she left, to be back the following evening.

""She called the next afternoon, having missed her flight due to the time difference in Switzerland of which she was unaware.

""I asked her if I should call my friends in Geneva who would collect her and give her a bed for the night. She declined, saying she'd take a hotel room and Schabir would 'have to' pay for it.

""When she should have been back, a call came and I insisted on knowing who was speaking. 'Schabir' came the answer. I told him she wasn't back from Geneva where she'd gone to open a bank account for the ­proceeds of bribery and corruption.

""She arrived, left for South Africa and the next communication was a call from her husband, Mac, who told me they were writing their wills and would I stand as executor should anything happen to them.

""I reminded him that I'd do anything for the welfare of their children who I loved as my own. He thanked me and told me he'd be in touch. I've never heard from him or seen his wife and children to this day.

""I have been in a state of confusion ever since.""

Legacy of a 'foul secret'

In a subsequent interview with the M&G, Shirene expanded on this account and her reasons for coming forward now.

Shirene alleged that in the 16 years since 1996, on five trips to South Africa, she had attempted to see her sister face to face in order to deal with the legacy of what she called this ""foul secret"".

Each time she was rebuffed, she claimed.

Shirene's story is consistent with the known facts. The M&G has discovered, among the evidence submitted at the Shaik trial, previously unreported information suggestive of a link between Shaik, Thales and the account. Among the documents seized by the Scorpions from Thales' offices in South Africa were business cards and handwritten numbers for a director of Banque SCS and a fax found during the raids on Shaik featured a business card for the same director.

In addition, details of the build-up to and aftermath of the breakdown in her relationship with Zarina also provide some corroboration for Shirene's account.

First came a visit by Mac and Zarina to London earlier in 1996, when Nelson Mandela made a triumphant state visit as president of a newly democratic South Africa.

Mandela, with Mac and family in tow, arrived on July 9 1996, Shirene's 50th birthday.

Shirene's celebration

Mandela's visit ended on July 13, but Mac and Zarina could not stay for Shirene's celebration, set to take place on Sunday July 14, despite having been invited long in advance.

One of the reasons they stood her up is telling.

On July 2, Schabir Shaik had written to engineering firm Brown & Root, Shaik's intended partners in another project under the department of transport, the planned new La Mercy airport outside Durban, now known as King Shaka.

Shaik asked the American company to make arrangements for a Disney World holiday by the Maharaj family. The intended travel dates were July 13 to 16.

In his letter, Shaik noted that this assistance to the minister was ""strategically important to ourselves"".

The family duly skipped the birthday party and Brown & Root picked up the R15 000-plus tab for accommodation and airport transfer and invoiced Shaik. It is not clear whether Maharaj ever repaid Shaik.

During this time, Shaik also addressed a letter to Mac at the Dorchester Hotel in London, where he was staying as part of Mandela's entourage.

The letter confirmed the booking at Disney World and included the following note to Mac: ""Brown & Root people, my partner and colleagues in South Africa, were expecting you to call them. Kindly advise Dr Anwar Wissa when that would be possible given your more relaxed schedule in the States.

Zarina's bitterness

""Special message. I understand from my warehouse that the expected documents had reached your desk in the UK. Kindly confirm at your soonest.""

Mac and Zarina did see Shirene during that London trip, however. Shirene and her partner Ted joined them for a meal at a restaurant on the Thames.

After dinner, despite the glow of South Africa's democratic transition and the glittering setting, some of Zarina's bitterness burst through, Shirene alleged.

""We went out for a coffee on the balcony. Zarina stood there and said, in front of everyone, in front of my daughters, in front of their partners, in front of her children, she said: 'If it wasn't for you, Mac would be minister of defence'.""

The background to that comment was, according to Shirene, her perceived political unreliability: ""According to them, I was a renegade.""

She believes this stemmed partly from a report she made to Mac about conditions in ANC camps in Angola following the 1984 Pango mutiny, which was brutally put down.

""I was in the camps in Pango and I was listening to the people complaining [about conditions] and I was saying to them, 'I will take your complaints back to HQ.'

Mac Mahraj and his wife Zarina. (Sunday Times)

Causes of the mutiny

""So, when I went back to Lusaka, I said to Mac: 'You know people are very unhappy … and the causes of the mutiny, I've been told it was this and it was that.'

""Some of the soldiers had been [there] since the 1976 uprisings: they were not being deployed … many of them had not even been allowed to set foot outside the camp in eight years.

""And Mac said: 'Oh you're just a …' I forget the term he used – someone on the periphery.""

Shirene is aware that she will be accused of drawing on this well of bitterness to make up a damaging story about her sister after the existence of the Geneva bank account was first revealed in City Press in March 2007.

Against that accusation, she said, she had raised the issue before.

Her partner, Ted Dougherty, confirmed that she long ago relayed to him the outlines of Zarina's Geneva gambit and its implications.

Shirene said she also told her brother Adam, who lives in Canada, and her daughter Magali long before the details became public.

""I told Magali because she was staunch ANC and she said, 'Mum, you've got to go to the ANC and report them.' I said, 'Magali can you imagine what would happen if we brought this up? What would happen to their children?'""

An explanation

Shirene said Adam did not want to get involved and she was worried that a wedge had been established between her and her daughter.

""Since my sister went to visit her in June last year, she hasn't communicated with me. I don't know what Zarina has told her.""

Shirene said she also wrote to Mac and Zarina asking for an explanation for why they had involved her.

They never wrote back or came to see her again, in spite of passing through London on many occasions.

In about 2007, she also wrote an email about Zarina to two other people: activist and artist John Matshikiza and former M&G editor Ferial Haffajee.

Matshikiza was a friend of Shirene's when he lived in London.

Involved in corruption

When she realised he had written the foreword to Zarina's autobiography, Dancing to a Different Rhythm, published in 2006, she made contact: ""I needed to warn him so he would be prepared whenever it became public knowledge that she had been involved in corruption.""

She said neither Matshikiza (who died in 2008) nor Haffajee replied to her.

Haffajee said that she received the correspondence and wrote back, but did not receive a reply. She said she recalled that Swiss accounts were mentioned amid ""personal stuff"" about Zarina and she passed the information on to the newsroom with a caveat about the source, but it was never followed up.

Corroboration of these contacts was provided by Zarina herself. Shirene showed the M&G an SMS from her most recent communication with her sister, in December last year, in which Zarina notes: ""Shirene, the ever widening chasm between us can perhaps still be narrowed – the content of your emails to Johnny when he was still alive and a journalist, notwithstanding. Drop in in the new year.""

But the casualness of the invitation infuriated Shirene: ""Like … I should 'drop in' – even if you might be busy – [when] what I wanted to say was: 'I wanted to see you only to ask you why you burdened me with your foul secret which you expect me to take to my grave'.""
