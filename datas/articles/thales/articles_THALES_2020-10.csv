Thales to Provide Mobile Driver Licenses to State of Florida - Thales,"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 22:21:10 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi90aGFsZXMtcHJvdmlkZS1tb2JpbGUtZHJpdmVyLWxpY2Vuc2VzLXN0YXRlLWZsb3JpZGHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales to Provide Mobile Driver Licenses to State of Florida

Thales is to provide the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles with a nationally and internationally compliant mobile Driver License service.

Thales will act as a Credential Service Provider, at the heart of the state’s identity verification and online authentication programs.

Thales will also provide a mobile Driver License solution for Floridians to verify their identity, including proof of age as well as driving rights.



The State of Florida will be the first state in the United States to provide mobile Driver Licenses with leading-edge security mechanisms, fully compliant with rigorous national and international standards. Thales will supply the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles with mobile Driver License verification services, as well as a mobile Driver License solution for residents.

In 2021, Florida residents will be able to apply for new mobile Driver Licenses that are easily accessible on a variety of devices, including smartphones and tablets. These mobile Driver Licenses meet the national and international standards from the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators and the International Organization for Standardization, meaning they can be used across the United States and internationally.

These new mobile Driver Licenses have the same validity as traditional driver’s licenses to verify identity, including proof of age and driving privileges. It also provides an additional role as a strong authentication tool, enabling Floridians to securely prove who they are online for a variety of services.

Now, to complement the traditional use of driver licenses to prove their identity, Florida residents will be able to simply activate their mobile identification application, select the type of verification needed, and hold up their mobile device. The mobile device never leaves the owners hand, making it a contact-free and convenient way to show ID.

“I’m excited for this innovation project that will make the state of Florida a national leader in offering secure and trusted mobile identification, which is a priority for our Governor, Ron DeSantis,” said Terry L. Rhodes, Executive Director of the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. “We have made a sustained commitment to the modernization of nearly every aspect of what our department does and how customers access our services, and Thales will be a great partner as Florida now steps into the future of mobile identification.”

“As ID fraud becomes more frequent and sophisticated, we made it a priority to reinforce ID verification by adding extra software security technologies. In the future, enterprises such as airports, hotels, car rental companies etc, in Florida will be able to rely on Thales to identify customers, while guaranteeing their privacy”, said Tony Lo Brutto, VP NORAM, Identity and Biometric Solutions at Thales.

These mobile Driver Licenses are harder to counterfeit, as they host a secure digitized credential whose authenticity can be checked rather than simply displaying a digital image of a driver license that could be easily manipulated.

For stronger privacy, users of mobile Driver Licenses control what information is displayed from the app depending on the context. For example, to enter a casino it only needs to show that the individual is old enough and the mobile Driver License will just display that information – not the individual’s name, date of birth, or address.

The Florida mobile Driver License program builds on Thales’ strong foundation of supporting state identity programs for 11 other U.S. states and five Canadian provinces.

Note to Editors

Thales, a leader in mobile driver’s license technology, successfully conducted the first U.S. mobile Driver’s License or Digital Driver’s License pilots across multiple states through a partnership and grant awarded in 2016 by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology. Thales has recently been nationally recognized for the Digital ID Wallet, which incorporates the mobile Driver’s License solution, by Frost & Sullivan and ABI Research.

#Humpspotter Alert: ThinKom Ka antenna breaks cover on Spirit mod - Runway Girl Network,"Sun, 18 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMjAvMTAvaHVtcHNwb3R0ZXItYWxlcnQtdGhpbmtvbS1rYS1hbnRlbm5hLWJyZWFrcy1jb3Zlci1vbi1zcGlyaXQtbW9kL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Rumors have long swirled that ThinKom Solutions was helping Thales rectify the problems plaguing its long-delayed Ka-band inflight connectivity program for Spirit Airlines – problems described by Spirit CEO Ted Christie to Runway Girl Network as “technical glitches”.

Thales batted away the notion last fall, telling Runway Girl Network at the Airline Passenger Experience Association exhibition in Los Angeles: “For Spirit, the configuration remains the same. As you mentioned, there has been some hiccup in the program. We are overcoming all the difficulties. And now we work very closely with Spirit as far as the installation of all the aircraft from their fleet.”

And, as recently as May 2020, it seemed that Thales’ antenna was still being employed. After RGN broke the news about Thales layoffs in Florida and California, a source told us that the French aerospace manufacturer was still using “the TCS antenna” for the Spirit program, in apparent reference to hardware made by the Thales division once known as Thales Communications & Security (TCS).

“They had a problem with a polarity switch and then with moisture getting into the antenna and not getting out. Supposedly that issue was fixed last fall 2019,” said the source, noting: “They did have a ThinKom [antenna] but stopped qualifying it.” Neither ThinKom nor Thales has confirmed this information.

Now, however, ThinKom’s Ka2517-branded antenna hardware appears to be in play. Ryan Vaughn, who works as certification project engineer/ODA unit member – structures at Thales, recently revealed to his followers on LinkedIn that Thales is nearing completion of “Thales’ latest in-flight Ka-band connectivity system at STS Mod Center in Melbourne, FL. Next step is electromagnetic interference (EMI) testing then STC issuance!”

Notably the image he shared showed the signature slimline disks of ThinKom’s mechanically steered, phased array VICTS-based antenna. As the saying goes, “A picture is worth a thousand words.” Unfortunately, the post – with photo – was later removed.

However, before the post was removed, Vaughn was asked if the image represents the complete configuration of the antenna. ThinKom CTO Bill Milroy answered the question, saying on the thread: “Yes. 18 dB/K broadside G/T, full ITU TX and RX band coverage, GSO/NGSO interoperable, and with the ability to reliably close links down to 10 degree elevation (….but without the yellow protective shipping covers of course!)”

For its part, MRO provider STS has said it will equip more than 100 Airbus aircraft with Thales Wi-Fi systems over the next 12 months at its Melbourne, Florida facility. “The first aircraft to be a part of this program, an A321, arrived a few days ago and installation work is already underway,” said Mark Smith, president of STS Aviation Group in a statement last week.

The Ka-band connectivity system, which will initially transmit via Hughes Ka satellites, and ultimately via the high-capacity SES-17 satellite, is a long time in coming for Spirit Airlines. In the spring of 2018, the ultra-low-cost carrier first announced plans to partner with Thales to bring the provider’s FlytLIVE-branded solution to its fleet later that year.

In terms of price points, the carrier said it would offer two products to start with – a web and texting tier, and a streaming tier. The web and texting service will be, on average, $6.50, and the streaming will be $9.00, it said.

“Actual costs may be lower or higher based on the route and demand,” according to Spirit’s latest online statement. The entire fleet equipage program is now expected to be finished in 2021, roughly two years later than originally planned.

News that the IFC retrofit program is finally progressing will be welcomed by Spirit passengers, who have shown a strong interest in being connected.

But Spirit management might also be eager to flip the switch. It is generally not widely known by the traveling public that point-of-sale devices used to transact food/beverage and retail sales on board aircraft without connectivity do not authorize credit cards in real time. Rather, these transactions occur when the aircraft lands and arrives at the gate, and when passengers are long gone.

Some passengers have cottoned on to the fact that Spirit is unable to process credit card transactions in real time. That can make onboard theft a concern.

ThinKom, meanwhile, is certainly not new to the IFC game. Its Ku-band antenna hardware is white labeled by Gogo as 2Ku, and is installed on thousands of aircraft. MRO provider GDC Technics also recently announced it has installed ‘all-in’ Ka-band IFC package for a Hillwood Airways-operated Boeing 737-700 in collaboration with ThinKom Solutions, Kontron and Hughes Network Systems. These partners stand at the ready to support additional Ka IFC programs.

RAPIDFire: Thales and Nexter to equip French Navy ships with new CIWS system - Naval News,"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDIwLzEwL3JhcGlkZmlyZS10aGFsZXMtYW5kLW5leHRlci10by1lcXVpcC1mcmVuY2gtbmF2eS1zaGlwcy13aXRoLW5ldy1jaXdzLXN5c3RlbS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"RAPIDFire: Thales and Nexter to equip French Navy ships with new CIWS system The RAPIDFire system developed by the consortium formed by Thales and Nexter has been chosen by the French defence procurement agency (DGA) to equip future French Navy vessels with new artillery. This new system will provide the Navy’s surface vessels with an effective close-in defence capability against modern air and surface threats.

RAPIDFire is an innovative, versatile close-in weapon system designed to protect naval vessels against modern air and surface threats.

Thales / Nexter press release

Naval forces are exposed to several threats with complex behaviours, such as unmanned air and surface vehicles, light aircraft and missiles. RAPIDFire leverages the combined expertise of Thales and Nexter to meet the very short-range defence requirements of the armed forces. The solution features a latest-generation multi-threat (air and surface), multi-environment (land and naval) gun system, with a cost of engagement commensurate with the value of the threats.

RAPIDFire is a gun system that offers high precision thanks to its optronic fire control system integrated onto the turret, its advanced algorithms, powerful gun and automatic ammunition management system allowing the best reactivity and efficiency for the operator. RAPIDFire incorporates the new reference medium calibre 40 mm gun developed by CTAI, the international subsidiary of Nexter Systems and BAE Systems. The system is compatible with the full range of ammunitions developed for land forces programmes and is predisposed to the use of future ammunition as the smart Anti Aerial Airburst (A3B) round.

RAPIDFire is predisposed to the use of future ammunition such as the smart Anti Aerial Airburst (A3B) round.

Nexter and Thales formed a temporary consortium for RAPIDFire as part of a work programme and roadmap put in place 10 years ago. The programme is currently in the development phase. When development is complete, the weapon systems will enter production, and the first delivery is scheduled for 2022. Developed in a surface-to-air approach allowing use at sea but also from land, the project also provides an option to prepare for future use on land carriers. RAPIDFire, a true joint solution, will thus be a gun system capable of equipping naval, land and air forces.

“We’re delighted to be supporting the French Navy as it enhances the self-defence capabilities of its warships. With its combination of fast-into-action time and firing accuracy, RAPIDFire, developed in cooperation with Nexter, provides the best response for protecting Navy vessels against modern threats. It has the potential to become a key component of our offering of advanced force protection solutions.”



Thomas Got, Vice-President Integrated Airspace-protection Systems, Thales

“The 40 CTA has unrivalled power and compactness, making it a gun system that is particularly suitable for protecting surface vessels. With RAPIDFire, Nexter is delighted to extend the CTA40’s range of use in cooperation with Thales and the French Navy.”



Michel Vatrey, Systems and Programmes Director, Nexter

Naval News comments

The Chevallier-class replenishment tankers will be fitted with two RAPIDFire CIWS

As Naval News previously reported, the first two French Navy ship classes set to be fitted with this new close in weapon system (CIWS) are:

the Chevallier-class replenishment tankers ( also known as BRF )

) the future class of OPV (currently known as the Patrouilleurs Océanique program)

Future platforms will likely include the European Patrol Corvette (EPC) and the 6 mine warfare motherships for UAV/USV/UUV known as “bâtiments de guerre des mines” (BGDM).

The move to procure (and fund the development of) a new CIWS can be perceived as a doctrinal change for the French Navy: Unlike many NATO navies, Marine Nationale vessels did not use close in weapon systems as a last resort protection against incoming missiles, relying instead on advanced and powerful electronic warfare jammers. That being said, the RAPIDFire based on the 40 mm gun developed by CTAI won’t be just a CIWS but a “hybrid” system: Unlike the Phalanx or Goalkeeper (both 20mm and 30mm Gatling systems), RAPIDFire comes with a full range of ammunition and can be fitted as the main naval gun system on smaller displacement vessels."
Solving the Thales Ka-band antenna conundrum - PaxEx.Aero,"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vcGF4ZXguYWVyby90aGFsZXMta2EtYmFuZC1hbnRlbm5hLXRoaW5rb20ta2EyNTE3LXNwaXJpdC1haXJsaW5lcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Thinkom ThinAir 2517 Ka-band antenna system is in the STC process on a Spirit Airlines A321, part of the Thales Ka-band offering

Late last year Thales conceded defeat. The company acknowledged that its Ka-band antenna solution was not living up to the challenges of delivering the new in-flight connectivity service to airline customers. It would require a “rip-and-replace” upgrade to meet its goals.

Now, with the resumption of installations at STS Aero Mod in Melbourne we’re learning just what that rip-and-replace means. The new Thales system will fly with the Thinkom Ka2517 antenna kit on board, not Thales’s in-house solution.

This is a huge boost for Thinkom, recognizing the efficiency and reliability of its mechanically steered, phased array solution. And using the separate antennae for transmit (17″) and receive (25″) similar to the 2Ku approach Gogo pioneered with Ku-band on commercial aircraft furthers the efficiency of the offering.

Since late 2018 PaxEx.Aero has been following reports of Thinkom’s progress in gaining customers for the Ka2517 kit on commercial aircraft. Gogo suggested late last year that it could roll out Ka-band services on its existing fleet and upped the speculation on that front in May 2020 when it announced an option to swap from 2Ku to 2Ka on a short maintenance visit, trading the Ku-band apertures on board for the smaller Ka-band options while retaining the rest of the installation infrastructure.

We’ve also followed stories of multiple A320 and 737 family STC programs, including the installation of the ThinAir Ka2517 system on private aircraft.

But now we know that at least one Spirit Airlines plane has the Ka2517 kit on the roof. And this is where things become even more interesting.

Thales launches small AESA radar for small aircraft - Defense News,"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9jNGlzci8yMDIwLzEwLzE2L3RoYWxlcy1sYXVuY2hlcy1zbWFsbC1hZXNhLXJhZGFyLWZvci1zbWFsbC1haXJjcmFmdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS – Thales launched on Oct. 16 its new AirMaster C, a compact, active electronically scanned array (AESA), airborne surveillance radar for small and medium-sized platforms.

Although the radar’s design phase has been finalized it still needs testing airborne. Nevertheless, Stéphane Lavigne, a sales director at Thales, said that the French Armed Forces Ministry had already notified its intention to buy the equipment for the future light joint army helicopter, the Guépard, developed by Airbus Helicopters and due to enter service in 2026.

Jon Bye, Thales' head of customer marketing, said that the AirMaster C would ensure customers got “that great picture, first time, every time.”

The active antenna radar is based on SiGe (silicon-germanium) technology fully validated in 2019. Thales says SiGe is “much more energy efficient than other technologies used for AESA radars, and allows the radar to self-cool.”

RELATED

François Arpagaus, the company’s airborne surveillance product line director, said that AirMaster C is easy to integrate, less complex to operate and would allow users to “see more, more of the time” thanks to “multi-polarization” which allows the radar to automatically select the optimal settings for each mission.

The radar was designed for a small footprint, making it 30 percent lower in size, weight and power than other radars in its class. It is small, no bigger than two A4 pages side by side, weighs less than 20 kg (45 lbs) and uses about 1 Kw of power. “It’s perfect for small and medium-sized platforms, both manned and unmanned,” Arpagaus said.

Lavigne said the sensor had been designed with a lot of input from radar users. “The program is launched, we are ready to take orders,” he said, adding that typical delivery time from contract signing would happen within two years.

ESA awards contracts for moon and Mars exploration - SpaceNews,"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9lc2EtYXdhcmRzLWNvbnRyYWN0cy1mb3ItbW9vbi1hbmQtbWFycy1leHBsb3JhdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — The European Space Agency has awarded contracts for work on elements of its moon and Mars exploration program, ranging from modules for the lunar Gateway to a mission to return Mars samples to Earth.

ESA’s announcement of the contracts was tied to an Oct. 14 session of the International Astronautical Congress (IAC), where ESA and European companies discussed their partnership with NASA on both the Artemis lunar exploration program and the Mars Sample Return series of missions.

The projects are funded by the contributions that ESA’s member states provided to exploration programs at the Space19+ ministerial meeting last November. “This gives us new possibilities to go to low Earth orbit, the moon and Mars, and to do it together,” ESA Director General Jan Woerner said at the IAC.

Among the contracts announced were two to Thales Alenia Space for elements of the NASA-led lunar Gateway. Thales Alenia’s Italian business is the prime contractor for the I-Hab, an international habitation module, while its French business will be the prime contractor for the European System Providing Refueling, Infrastructure and Telecommunications (ESPRIT), a refueling and communications module. The I-Hab contract is worth 327 million euros ($383 million). Work has started on ESPRIT under an authorization-to-proceed notice from ESA, with the contract to be finalized by the end of the year.

“I-Hab is one of the most important elements, if not the most important element, on the Gateway,” said Massimo Claudio Comparini, senior executive vice president at Thales Alenia Space, in an interview. Besides providing living space for visiting crews, it will have additional docking ports for visiting vehicles.

Thales plans to leverage its experience building modules for the International Space Station and for Northrop Grumman’s Cygnus cargo spacecraft for the Gateway, but with some modifications. “The lunar environment is different from low Earth orbit,” he said, requiring improved micrometeoroid shielding and radiation protection. There will also be greater emphasis on autonomous and remote operations, since unlike the ISS, the Gateway will have crews on board only occasionally.

I-Hab is scheduled for launch in 2026. ESPRIT consists of two elements, which will launch separately. Its telecommunications element will be installed on Northrop Grumman’s Habitation and Logistics Outpost module, which will launch with the Power and Propulsion Element in 2023. The refueling element, which also includes a pressurized module with large windows, is scheduled to launch by 2027.

Airbus Defence and Space received an ESA contract to build the Earth Return Orbiter, the last of three missions in the overall NASA-ESA Mars Sample Return program. The orbiter, launching in 2026, will go into orbit around Mars and collect a sample canister launched into orbit by a NASA-developed lander also launching in 2026. The orbiter will then return the samples to Earth, arriving in 2031.

The contract for the orbiter is valued at 491 million euros. Airbus also has study contracts from ESA for a “fetch rover” that will fly on the NASA lander mission, collecting samples cached by NASA’s Mars Perseverance rover launched in July and returning them to the lander. The company is under contract from ESA for the service modules for the first three Orion spacecraft, with negotiations in process on a contract for the next three.

“It’s a great day for Airbus. We are extremely proud ESA has entrusted Airbus with the most vital aspect of space exploration for the next decade,” said Jean-Marc Nasr, head of Airbus Space Systems, in a press conference after the IAC session.

Both Airbus and Thales Alenia received contracts from ESA for initial studies of the European Large Logistic Lander (EL3), a robotic lander that will be capable of carrying up to 1.5 metric tons to the lunar surface. ESA envisions using the lander starting in the late 2020s for delivering cargo to support future human missions as well as for science missions, including lunar sample return.

David Parker, director of human and robotic exploration at ESA, said in an interview that the study contracts will lead to the selection of one of the companies to proceed with development of EL3, assuming funding for the program is allocated by ESA’s member states at the next ministerial meeting in 2022. A call for ideas this summer for potential applications of EL3 led to 300 proposals, which he said are being used to develop “model missions” to support those studies.

ESA has now signed contracts for various elements of its overall exploration program worth 1.3 billion euros, Parker said, which will grow to 2.9 billion euros by the end of next year. Part of the contracting process involves balancing funding contributed by the member states to the exploration program to specific areas of interest. He noted Germany was particularly interested in lunar robotic missions, while France and Italy had a greater interest in the lunar Gateway and Mars Sample Return.

Besides building various spacecraft, ESA’s member states anticipate its investment will give it an opportunity to fly ESA astronauts on Artemis missions to the moon. “We obviously have the ambition to get European astronauts to the surface to moon,” he said. Those projects as well as future contributions, like developing a satellite system to provide lunar communications and navigation, could enable ESA to assign an astronaut to a later Artemis mission.

NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine, who appeared at the IAC session with Woerner, acknowledged that NASA was relying on ESA for carrying out the Artemis program. “That mission, on day one, is going to be international and it will include the European Space Agency as not just a critical partner but a critical enabler,” he said."

LinkedIn

Toulouse, October 8, 2020 – Thales Alenia Space, the joint company between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), announced today it has installed a complete set of solar carports at its Toulouse facility, which are now online and generating electricity. This first sustainable parking installation will be replicated at other company sites in Europe between now and 2021.

Thales Alenia Space chose EDF Group subsidiary EDF ENR to install its French-made solar carports at the Toulouse site. Now a feature of one of the main parking lots at the site, the carports have a combined surface area of 8,400 square meters (over 90,400 sq. ft) and will produce 1.8 gigawatt-hours of electricity a year, which will be used at the facility. This equates to 6% of the site’s total consumption. Thales Alenia Space’ Toulouse plant has thus inaugurated a new generation of sustainable parking lots, which will reduce its CO2 emissions by 25 metric tons a year. The carports offer space for 640 vehicles, which will be protected from rain and sun.

These solar carports are a sustainable and profitable investment for Thales Alenia Space. They were installed under a 10-year lease/purchase contract with EDF ENR for the canopies and the solar array, with a fee equivalent to the amount of electricity produced. Thales Alenia Space in Toulouse is now producing clean, carbon-free energy, which will all feed into the site. Ownership of the installation will transfer to the company in 2030. A second solar parking lot will be built in the next few months, taking green energy production to 10% of the site’s total consumption.

Denis Allard, General Manager of the Thales Alenia Space plant in Toulouse: “Construction of this solar parking lot is a pilot project for Thales Alenia Space and will be replicated at several of our Europe sites between now and 2021. It’s a prime example of our commitment to protecting the environment and reducing our carbon footprint. These sustainable carparks will help achieve Thales’s goal of lowering its direct greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030.1""

Benjamin Declas, CEO of EDF ENR: “We’re delighted to be helping Thales Alenia Space with its broader objective to better manage its electricity usage and contribute to the energy transition. These solar carports will provide power for the site while ensuring a better parking experience for staff and visitors.”

Commissioning these carports at the Toulouse site is a pioneering project for Thales Alenia Space. Similar initiatives are in progress at some of the company’s other Europe facilities, including Cannes, where 5,400 square meters (over 58,000 sq. ft) of solar panels are being installed. They will produce 1.3 gigawatt-hours of electricity a year, equivalent to 4% of the site’s total consumption. By 2021, five Thales Alenia Space facilities in Europe will have solar parking lots: Toulouse and Cannes in France, Charleroi in Belgium and L’Aquila and Turin in Italy. Together, these new-generation parking facilities will generate 6.58 gigawatt-hours a year, reducing the company’s CO2 emissions by 1,031 metric tons.

1 The base year for this goal is 2018.

European Space Agency chooses Thales Alenia Space to deliver the Europe’s two main modules for the lunar space station, key element of the Artemis NASA program

Turin, October, 14 2020 – Thales Alenia Space, the joint company between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), will develop two key modules for the upcoming Lunar Orbital Platform–Gateway (LOP-G): I-HAB (International Habitat) and the ESPRIT communications and refueling module. These two modules are the European contribution for this Gateway. The first tranche of I-HAB contract, (worth 36 million euros, the global amount being 327 million euros), has been signed with the European Space Agency (ESA), while ESPRIT development has already started under Authorization To Proceed (ATP) with a contract signature expected by the end of the year.

This Gateway, a manned lunar orbital infrastructure, is one of the pillars of NASA’s Artemis program, designed to return humans to the Moon by 2024. It is being implemented through international cooperation, currently involving NASA (United States), ESA (Europe), JAXA (Japan) and CSA (Canada) with each partner in charge of the development of complementary elements, to be assembled and operated in lunar orbit as from 2024. The station, weighing about 40 metric tons, will be automatically assembled piece by piece in a near rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO)* around the Moon. The final configuration is still partly under final consolidation, but it will mainly comprise habitation modules for the crew offering as well docking capabilities for visiting vehicles and the Orion space capsule, logistics modules, communications with the Earth and Moon, EVA airlocks for scientific experiments and crew extravehicular activities (EVA), as well as a robotic arm. It is not intended for permanent occupancy, but will be able to host 4-person crews for periods of one to three months. Gaining new experiences on and around the Moon will prepare NASA to send the first humans to Mars in the coming years, and the Gateway will play a vital role in this process.

Hervé Derrey, CEO of Thales Alenia Space declared, “We would like to thank our customer ESA for continuing to place their trust in our ability to build Europe’s two main contributions to the lunar space station, as well as national space agencies in particular CNES and ASI for their support in these two programs. Through our contributions to the ISS, the Axiom commercial space station and now the lunar space station, we are expanding the possibilities in this field, not only in terms of technology, but also for the safety and comfort of astronauts.”

Thales Alenia Space has been chosen to build Europe’s two main contributions to this space station:

• I-HAB (International - Habitat), a pressurized module that will provide crew living quarters, plus docking points to supply interfaces and resources to vehicles in transit. Drawing on Thales Alenia Space’s long-standing expertise in the development of pressurized modules for the ISS, along with new technologies and processes, I-HAB will mark the transition from the ISS to a new generation of space infrastructures for deep space exploration. It will meet evolving requirements and performances for lighter structures and optimized micrometeorites protection system, evolved docking systems and hatches, enhanced functional and avionic architectures, more efficient thermal control system with deployable radiators to ensure full autonomous capability of heat rejection, innovative conditioning systems. The I-HAB will experience for the first time long exposure in the deep space environment, offering the opportunity to test and prove potential design solutions for protection against cosmic radiations. Being unmanned for most of its time on orbit, it will also require dedicated solutions for the robotic operations, either on board and externally. One of the key evolving step with respect to the ISS will be focused on designing, with the support of virtual reality technique, more comfortable internal accommodations, with exploitation of modular and reconfigurable solutions to optimize room and comfort for the crew. The module will be provided by Europe with contributions from the other space Agencies like environmental and life support system from JAXA, avionics and software parts from NASA and robotic components from CSA; the integration of all these elements in I-HAB will leverage on the large experience already acquired by Thales Alenia Space during the ISS Nodes 2 and 3 activities already developed in cooperation. I-HAB is slated for launch in 2026.

• ESPRIT (European System Providing Refueling, Infrastructure and Telecommunications) consists in 2 two main elements. The first, named HLCS (Halo Lunar Communication System), ensures the communications between the Gateway and the Moon. Launch is planned 2024 with HALO, the first habitation and logistics module, supplied by the United States, and derived from the Cygnus resupply cargo, for which Thales Alenia Space has been selected to provide its primary structure and micrometeoroid protection system. ESPRIT includes a second part named ERM (ESPRIT Refueling Module) which combines the refueling of the Gateway with a small pressurized module with windows. ERM will provide active refueling of the Gateway with xenon and chemical propellants to extend its life time but also prepare for re-usable Lunar Lander or Deep Space Transport (to Mars). ERM’s pressurized tunnel provides wide windows offering a 360° view on Space, Moon, Earth and on the Gateway. This pressurized volume will also contain various logistics and other elements for the crew. Delivery is planned for 2026, with launch the following year.

Massimo Claudio Comparini Senior Executive Vice President Observation, Exploration and Navigation at Thales Alenia Space, commented, “Through these contracts, Thales Alenia Space will call on the full sum of our expertise to expand our knowledge base and push back the frontiers of the cislunar exploration. Looking further ahead, this space station will be a jumping-off point for future human missions into deep space, including Mars”.

Thales Alenia Space will have to meet a number of daunting challenges to design and build these two modules:

• Technical challenges due to the severe lunar environment and extreme thermal conditions, , including protection against micrometeorites and cosmic radiation..

• Complying with the Artemis program schedule, as well as with stringent launch weight to be compatible with a US commercial launcher.

• Autonomous operation: since the lunar space station will not be permanently occupied, unlike the ISS, it will have to be able to function independently. Thales Alenia Space will provide robotic interfaces for both modules, I-HAB and ESPRIT, enabling remote operation and maintenance.

Walter Cugno, Vice President, Science and Exploration at Thales Alenia Space concluded: I’m very proud that we have leveraged the expertise built up on the International Space Station to make us the European benchmark in orbital infrastructures and a pivotal partner in the Humanity’s return to the Moon challenge”.

*NRHO: an eccentric orbit with an apogee at 70,000 km and a perigee at 3,000 km, enabling the space station to revolve around the Earth at the same speed as the Moon, so that from Earth it will be seen as a lunar halo.

More About I-HAB and ESPRIT industrial contributions

I-HAB: Thales Alenia Space in Italy is program prime contractor, with responsibility for overall program management, product assurance and safety, system engineering, functional design, all components concerning human factors, thermal and mechanical systems, the primary structure and production of hatches, and the assembly, integration and testing (AIT) phase. Thales Alenia Space in France is in charge of software and avionics subsystems.

ESPRIT: Thales Alenia Space in France is program prime contractor, with Thales Alenia Space in Italy in charge of the pressurized tunnel and windows. Thales Alenia Space in the UK will contribute to the chemical refueling system, while OHB (as part of the core team) will be in charge of mechanical and thermal subsystems for the non-pressurized sections and the xenon refueling system. Selected in open competition, Thales Alenia Space in Belgium will provide the HLCS electrical Interfaces units (Remote Interface & Distribution Unit – RIDU) and the radio frequency amplifiers (TWTAs), Thales Alenia Space in Spain the S-band communication transponder and Thales Alenia Space in Italy for the K-Band transceiver.

About Artemis: moving forward to the Moon in 2024! The Artemis program will proceed in three phases: Artemis 1, a non-crewed flight to test the launch system and the Orion spacecraft together; Artemis 2, a first crewed flight of Orion; and Artemis 3, to land astronauts on the Moon as from 2024. The program will set up sustainable structures on the Moon and in lunar orbit to carry out further human exploration of the surface and various scientific investigations. The Gateway will be a key to this program: it will be used as an outpost for astronauts on their way to the Moon, and as a laboratory to carry out scientific research, and thus support the development of sustained Moon exploration by the end of the decade. As from 2024, astronauts will have two options: lift off from the Earth and land directly on the Moon; or dock their Orion space capsule to the station, then rocket down to the Moon.

About Thales Alenia Space involvement in the moving forward to the Moon challenge

Already providing the thermo-mechanical systems for Orion European Service Module as well as the European Space Agency contribution in the Gateway with ESPRIT and I-HAB, Thales Alenia Space is also involved in NASA’s Human Landing System (HLS) initiative, as part of the Dynetics-led consortium recently chosen by NASA as well as in VIPER, the rover that NASA will send to the South Pole of the Moon in search for water. Moreover, Thales Alenia Space has been appointed by the European Space Agency, partnering with OHB Germany, for the engineering and feasibility study of the European Large Logistic Lander (EL3), envisioned as a versatile system that can support a variety of cargo delivery and science missions on the Lunar surface, in the frame of the ARTEMIS programme.

A new decade of European exploration – to the Moon and Mars

Thales Alenia Space technology and expertise will contribute to the Earth Return Orbiter which will bring Red Planet samples back to Earth

Turin, October 14, 2020 – Thales Alenia Space, the joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), has signed an Authorization To Proceed (ATP) with Airbus Defence and Space, prime contractor of the program, to contribute to the Earth Return Orbiter (ERO), the key element of the Mars Sample Return (MSR) Mission, which will be carried out through an international cooperation led by NASA. A first tranche, worth around €11 million, will be related to the B2 phase for a global contract value of around €130 million.

Thales Alenia Space will be responsible for:

supplying the Communication System, consisting of the elements allowing the data transmission between Earth and ERO and Mars

designing the crucial Orbit Insertion Module (OIM) and related thermo-mechanical, propulsion and electrical architectures

the Assembly Integration and Test (AIT) phase for the Proto-Flight model of the ERO Spacecraft composing elements in its test facilities of Turin and Toulouse.

The Earth Return Orbiter spacecraft is composed by the Return Module and the Orbit Insertion Module. The Return Module (RM) hosts the NASA payload devoted to the capture of the Martian samples orbiting around Mars, of their containment and delivery to Earth. The Orbit Insertion Module (OIM) is an additional chemical propulsive stage, for inserting the spacecraft into Mars orbit. This module is crucial as he will allow to reduce the spacecraft velocity enabling the Martian gravity to capture ERO in a stable orbit. After the maneuver successfully completed, IOM will be separated from RM in order to save mass prior to the return to Earth.

Hervé Derrey, CEO of Thales Alenia Space stated: “We are enthusiastic to be part of the core team on this revolutionary mission of bringing Mars to Earth, that will open a new frontier in Mars exploration missions. Mars Sample Return has an immense scientific importance, that could lead to new findings regarding Martian geology, climate and life itself. Our involvement in this new mission is not only reflecting our Space for Life aspiration but will take advantage of all we already have developed in term of technologies including the planetary protection duty.”

Massimo Claudio Comparini, Senior Executive Vice President Observation, Exploration and Navigation at Thales Alenia Space, added: “Thales Alenia Space will bring its expertise in the Mars exploration domain, leading the ExoMars 2016 and 2022 missions to search for life on the Red Planet. The Trace Gas Orbiter launched in 2016 in orbit around Mars is analyzing the Martian atmosphere before becoming the communication relay for all the upcoming missions landing on Mars”.

Leonardo is also widely involved in Mars exploration missions, from the ExoMars 2016 and 2022 missions to the Mars Sample Return program. On this latter program, Leonardo is studying and designing the two robotic arms that will collect and transfer the Martian samples on the Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV).

About the Mars Sample Return mission

By 2031, the Mars Sample Return mission will collect in situ Mars surface samples and bring them back for study in terrestrial laboratories. Firstly, the MSR Sample Retrieval Lander will descend to the planet’s surface carrying the Sample Fetch Rover (SFR) and the Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV). SFR will collect the samples from the Martian surface that have been cached by the NASA Mars 2020 Perseverance rover and the SFR will transfer these samples into Mars Ascent Vehicle, a mini-rocket developed by NASA, which will launch them into Mars orbit. In that moment, the ERO spacecraft, that will be launched in 2026, will be ready to locate and capture the samples released by the MAV. After the capture, the samples will then be sealed in a biological containment system and placed inside an Earth Entry Vehicle. ERO will then leave Martian orbit and head back to Earth. When it arrives back in Earth orbit, it will release the Earth Entry vehicle that will be recovered on ground and the sample analyzed.

how technology can deliver short-term reductions in global CO2 emissions - Thales,"Wed, 07 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGFsZXNncm91cC5jb20vZW4vZ3JvdXAvam91cm5hbGlzdC9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlL3RoYWxlcy1ob3ctdGVjaG5vbG9neS1jYW4tZGVsaXZlci1zaG9ydC10ZXJtLXJlZHVjdGlvbnMtZ2xvYmFsLWNvMtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales: how technology can deliver short-term reductions in global CO2 emissions Share this article



LinkedIn

• A world leader in air and rail mobility, Thales plans to connect flight management systems with air traffic management systems to achieve a 10% reduction in aircraft CO2 emissions by 2023, and is working to make trains smarter and optimise rail traffic to save 30% of their energy consumption.

• Thales is developing complex AI systems that promote eco-responsible AI based on learning and knowledge and consume less energy.

• Thales Alenia Space is unveiling new instruments for space missions that quantify human CO2 emissions with unprecedented accuracy and offer a 36% improvement in the accuracy of sea-ice topography measurements.



Real-time flight path optimisation thanks to PureFlyt, the brains of tomorrow's aircraft

PureFlyt is the Flight Management System (FMS) of the future. Fully connected and scalable, it constantly monitors, adjusts and fine-tunes the trajectory of an aircraft to optimise the flight for fuel consumption and ensure better on-time performance and more comfortable flights for passengers and crews.

As the ""brains"" of tomorrow's aircraft, PureFlyt ingests information in real time from a larger number of sources, not only data from the aircraft's own systems but also external sources such as weather services.

The technology behind PureFlyt has reached an unprecedented level of maturity in the fields of cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. AI has been used in countless flight tests to simulate some two billion scenarios and clock up the equivalent of 100 million flight hours in cumulative experience.

Predictive modelling of global air traffic, updated every minute, to improve coordination of all flights and eliminate wastage

Beyond the flight management system, Thales innovations are also shaping the future of air traffic management. In addition to the onboard systems that make it possible to optimise traffic flows at the local level, and augmented connectivity between onboard systems and the air traffic control infrastructure, tomorrow's ground-based air traffic management systems will optimise traffic across one or several airspace control areas. This overall optimisation takes all flights into consideration to increase the impact of local optimisation within any given air traffic ecosystem.

Thales's new Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) system uses a predictive model of global air traffic to propose trajectories that are optimised in terms of environmental performance (pollution and noise). Every minute, the system also updates the trajectories based on actual aircraft positions and data on wind conditions and other climate phenomena.

By combining AI with Thales's expertise in trajectory prediction algorithms for flight management systems, it is possible to predict air traffic with a high degree of reliability, and thus anticipate the decisions that will need to be made. Decisions are proposed by the algorithm to optimise the use of all resources (fuel, airspace, taxiways, apron, etc.).

Developed on a collaborative platform and hosted in a secure cloud environment, these ATFM services can be quickly deployed and used over the Internet by all the stakeholders in the air traffic ecosystem (air traffic controllers, airport operators, airlines, maintenance providers).

The ATFM and PureFlyt systems combined are expected to reduce aircraft CO2 emissions by as much as 10% by 2023.

The e-Drive electric motor: a first step toward the hybrid aircraft

To recover the aircraft's kinetic energy, Thales is working on a hybrid solution combining conventional aero engines with electric motors to increase performance, improve overall energy efficiency and optimise the weight of the aircraft.

At the end of 2018, the Group unveiled its eDrive electric motor, which is designed to replace a helicopter's conventional powerplant for short periods in the event of a main engine failure. Single-engined helicopters equipped with this stand-by propulsion system could then be authorised to fly over urban areas, replacing twin-engined models that consume more fuel and are more expensive to operate.

Under the aerospace stimulus plan, Thales intends to further develop this concept to achieve a full hybrid propulsion solution that would cut fuel consumption and reduce rotor speeds to mitigate the noise pollution caused by helicopters.

Environmental management from space: value-added services

Under the Copernicus programme for the European Space Agency and the European Commission, Thales Alenia Space is to develop new measurement instruments for monitoring the environment and the effects of climate change.

As part of the Copernicus Carbon Dioxide Monitoring Mission (CO2M), these instruments will make it possible for the first time to measure levels of atmospheric CO2 caused by human activity and will provide Europe with a single source of independent information to assess the effectiveness of policy measures and their impact on Europe's carbon footprint. The satellite will map the entire planet every six days and provide complete measurement data every 12 days. By combining three separate instruments, it will determine the type of emissions with unprecedented accuracy (within 4 km2) to detect peaks in pollution around a factory, city, highway or air corridor.

The IRIS dual-frequency interferometric radar altimeter for the CRISTAL mission will also monitor the world's glaciers, measuring sea-ice thickness and overlying snow depth in polar regions with 36% better accuracy than its predecessor thanks to higher resolution. In the current period of rapid climate change, this data is crucial to climate monitoring in view of the significant influence of the polar regions on global climate models, thermohaline circulation and the planetary energy balance. Ice melt can only be estimated by assessing what is happening beneath the surface; with these higher-resolution measurements, it will be possible to determine with greater accuracy which areas are going to melt.

Smarter trains, metros and stations for greater energy savings

Advanced robotics technologies make it possible to increase the number of vehicles on the rail network, improve on-time performance and optimise energy consumption.

Driver advisory systems (GreenSpeedTM), Traffic Management Systems (TMS), and systems to manage automatic operation of both metros (GreenCBTC) and autonomous trains (RailBotTM) optimise energy consumption through carefully defined driving strategies and by calculating optimal acceleration and braking profiles in real time.

Anticipating network incidents is also an important factor in reducing unexpected train stoppages caused by obstacles on the tracks. Equipped with high-performance connected sensors, a train or metro will be able to detect any obstacles on its own track, but also on parallel tracks, to automatically inform track teams, plan on-site work or even resolve the issue remotely, helping to save energy.

Station supervision systems will analyse energy consumption in real time. Their sensors will determine exact energy needs depending on passenger flows, for example, to ensure that energy consumption matches requirements as closely as possible, while guaranteeing expected levels of performance and without sacrificing passenger comfort.

Eco-responsible AI: a major opportunity for environmental protection

AI and data-driven systems have both positive and negative environmental impacts. While AI helps to reduce energy consumption (optimisation of air and ground transport, smart cities, etc.), it also consumes large quantities of energy itself during production and in use, just like any other electronic system. Today, Thales researchers are working on a four-pronged approach to improve the environmental responsibility of artificial intelligence:

• Reducing the impact of AI during the production phase by applying eco-design principles to product development and developing software-defined equipment to mitigate obsolescence issues.

• Improving AI algorithms by factoring energy consumption into the design of neural network architectures, and whenever possible, prioritising the development of knowledge-based symbolic or hybrid AI, which is much more energy efficient

• Favouring data quality over quantity, and adopting distributed architectures that retain certain centralised functions when absolutely necessary, to optimise bandwidth usage, and therefore energy consumption, without sacrificing performance.

• Improving electronics and implementation by developing electronic circuits that consume very little energy and applications of spintronics, the electronics of tomorrow, for extensively connected analogue systems

Thales Blue Sentry guards the seas - Thales,"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9jb3VudHJpZXMtYXNpYS9hdXN0cmFsaWEvbmV3cy90aGFsZXMtYmx1ZS1zZW50cnktZ3VhcmRzLXNlYXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"On Tuesday 12 October, the Minister for Defence Industry, Melissa Price announced the Defence Innovation Hub will be investing $28m in Australian industry. Of the nine contracts being funded, Thales Australia received $3.8m to develop our sovereign Blue Sentry autonomous system.

So, what exactly is Blue Sentry? It’s an autonomous team of Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) equipped for Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) and surveillance missions. In basic terms - the Thales Remote Active Sonar Systems (RASS) array, consisting of towed active and passive sonar sub systems, as well as an autonomous data processing, recording and reporting system will be integrated onto Ocius Technology’s autonomous platform – the Bluebottle.

Thales has been working collaboratively with Ocius since 2013 on the role of the USV in ASW and, according to Thales Research and Development Project Lead, Daniel Dent, the Bluebottle is a standout USV platform for long-term maritime mission endurance.

“The Bluebottle design has a unique combination of capabilities which keep it moving forward in all-weather while still producing enough power for the payload utilising solar cells on the sail and deck for electricity generation. It has been proven at sea now over many missions for several years, performing remarkably well.”

The Blue Sentry team, or fleet of USVs integrated with our sonar arrays, will be capable of remaining operational for extended periods of time in any weather autonomously patrolling large areas of ocean performing underwater ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance) missions. Missions that would have previously required the deployment of peopled assets for many days to complete will be able to be conducted remotely using the Blue Sentry team of Autonomous Vessels at a significantly reduced cost of coverage.

Another advantage of the Blue Sentry system is that it is capable of being deployed both at surface and sub-surface depths enabling detection, classification and localisation of craft on the surface or below the water that generate acoustic noise or produce acoustic reflections. In addition to the system’s autonomous detection capabilities, the Thales RASS element of Blue Sentry will enable covert communication to allies below the surface using long-range low frequency underwater communications.

Before the Blue Sentry is delivered however, there are a series of engineering innovations required to develop the current Bluebottle USV into Blue Sentry. Thales Australia and Ocius will utilise funding provided by the Defence Innovation Hub to conduct research work into the following areas: 1) trusted team autonomy, navigation and persistence, 2) size and power consumption of sonar systems, 3) communications Range and content, 4) integration of RASS sonar system, testing and proving for ASW missions and 5) mission hardening of the vessel teams.

The project is expected to run its initial phase for a period of three years, culminating in the development of a mission capable product demonstrator.

From humble beginnings, Ocius and Thales Australia have worked together to combine the strengths of two great Australian designed and developed technologies. Thales is widely known as one of the leading sonar array designers in the world and the Ocius’ Bluebottle has proven it can tow the Thales array at varying depths via its unique keel winch while quietly, persistently and freely navigating in Australia’s seas. Thanks to the Defence Innovation Hub, this contract means we have the opportunity to test our ‘next-generation’ combined product in different Areas of Operation off NT and WA with the aim to develop a world-beating capability. – Ocius Technology CEO – Robert Dane

On December 18, 2019, a Soyuz rocket lifted off from the Guiana Space Center, Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana. The launcher was carrying a number of satellites, including the first second-generation COSMO-SkyMed, built by Thales Alenia Space as prime contractor, ANGELS, the first French nanosatellite, and CHEOPS, a space telescope from the European Space Agency, built with a major contribution from Thales Alenia Space.

ANGELS up and running

We’re delighted to announce that the Argos Neo instrument on the ANGELS satellite has passed its in-flight review after completing acceptance testing and calibration. The commissioning of Argos Neo is a milestone in the ANGELS mission. Having completed all checks of the nanosat platform (a cubesat with volume of 12U) and the Argos Neo payload, the ANGELS demonstrator is now operational in orbit.

ANGELS, featuring an Internet of Things (IoT) solution and new-generation native geolocation, will now join the Argos fleet operated by Kineis. This is a French space agency CNES mission coordinated by the company Hemeria, which also supplies the nanosat platform. The Argos Neo payload was developed by Thales Alenia Space working with Syrlinks, a manufacturer of radio-communications equipment and geolocation systems, as the lead subcontractor.

Argos Neo: a miniaturized instrument to address fast-evolving space requirements

Argos Neo is the first in a new generation of Argos instruments, the global benchmark in IoT with native geolocation, designed to study and protect our planet. Thales Alenia Space and Syrlinks rose to the challenge of miniaturizing key components to make the payload compatible with the nanosat size platform used on ANGELS.

Argos Neo weighs only 2 kilos, ten times lighter than the previous generation, and uses three times less energy, while handling the same functions and offering greater capacity. Furthermore, it incorporates various components that enabled the manufacturer to reduce production time and cost. ANGELS was developed, launched and commissioned in less than 24 months. Its successful startup reflects the ability of Thales Alenia Space to miniaturize an extremely complex instrument such as Argos.

From Argos Neo to Kineis

We’re extremely proud of this new instrument, which heralds a new-generation French constellation, Kineis, with 25 nanosatellites designed for the Internet of Things. Thales Alenia Space is system architect for this constellation, which will be operated by Kineis. Within the production consortium, Thales Alenia Space is in charge of making the payload, with Syrlinks as lead subcontractor, while Hemeria is responsible for the platform. The payload comprises two instruments, one for the Internet of Things, the other dedicated to maritime surveillance applications.

Kineis covers a wide range of applications: tracking moving objects (ships of all sizes), natural resources management (detection of fishing zones), contribution to the “blue economy” (the sustainable use of ocean resources), personal safety and security, environmental management, collection of weather data, etc.

The “New Space” approach applied by Kineis complements Europe’s Copernicus program for environmental monitoring, an initiative in which Thales Alenia Space is the leading industrial partner.

Another major step towards New Space

Building on its experience with the ANGELS and Kineis missions, Thales Alenia Space has been chosen by American startup Omnispace to build the first satellites in its new constellation.

“We’re very proud of our selection by Omnispace, which is taking a holistic approach to the design, development and deployment of its new-generation satellite network, dedicated to the Internet of Things,” said Hervé Derrey, President and Chief Executive Officer of Thales Alenia Space. “Our selection confirms Thales Alenia Space’s market leadership as a pivotal industrial partner, and also reflects our expertise in satcom systems dedicated to IoT.”

“[…] Thales Alenia Space is perfectly qualified to support our vision of providing the first 5G network via satellite,” added Ram Viswanathan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Omnispace LLC.

Within the Omnispace industrial consortium, Thales Alenia Space is system prime contractor for both the space and ground segments. The payloads for the first two satellites are being developed under Thales Alenia Space’s responsibility, with Syrlinks as lead subcontractor. NanoAvionics was chosen to build the platforms, and French startup Anywaves will provide the antennas.

With this latest selection, Thales Alenia Space continues to bolster its position in the IoT segment of the New Space market.

Following successful rollout across Europe, Thales in the UK, Nokia and SkyFive are launching a new 4G LTE Air to Ground (A2G) solution to a global market. Delivering a fibre like connectivity experience, A2G significantly improves the inflight access to web, streaming and on-line games to passengers. In addition to improved passenger experiences, aircraft operators will benefit from significantly shortened installation times, minimising the time aircraft are out of operation.

Improved connectivity, enhanced experience

Offering seamless connectivity with speeds up to 100Mbps and latency of less than 50ms, this 4G LTE solution connects aircraft to high-speed Wi-Fi from the ground up. Utilising existing 4G technology, A2G connects aircrafts with the nearest purpose-built on-ground towers, seamlessly handing over between masts mid-flight to create consistently fast 4G connectivity throughout journeys. The high speeds and reduced latency are achieved through the impressive 4G LTE performance, combined with the short distances between the aircraft and towers, which are densely grouped to prevent aircrafts sharing bandwidth. The network's design also means A2G has greater capacity per km2 than current satellites.

Aboard A2G enabled aircraft, the experience for passengers will be comparable to using a 4G mobile phone service on the ground. The easy-to-access connection will make it possible for passengers to make uninterrupted video-conferencing calls, watch live TV or stream the latest series in HD from their own handset.

Easy installation, savings for airlines

As the aviation sector emerges from its biggest challenge yet, A2G presents an opportunity for carriers to make significant savings, improve customer experiences and increase ancillary revenues. Compared with SATCOM systems, the compact nature of the 4G antenna reduces CO2 emissions and cuts installation times down to just 12 hours, meaning aircraft spend less time out of operation while technology is installed.

Once installed, new 4G enabled in-flight capabilities will create an aircraft environment for an Internet of Things in which operational efficiencies such as engine offload data can be viewed in real time, customer experience can be measured and targeted advertising can be introduced. Better connectivity can also support the facilitation of new COVID-19 safety protocols as they are implemented.

Collaborating to create a safe, global network

The technology is being rolled out in regions around the world where domestic and international carriers will be able to use the 4G masts on land. It has been developed through a collaborative partnership with Thales providing the onboard terminal (modem+RF) and antenna; Nokia responsible for on-ground infrastructure and SkyFive’s patented software algorithms ensuring that aircraft can reliably connect at high speeds, high altitudes and across long ranges. With 30 years of experience in connecting airlines and proven European Aviation Network success, Thales has leveraged its expertise to ensure the benefits of the faster speeds do not come at the expense of a secure platform.

Andy Humphries, Managing Director, Flight Avionics at Thales in the UK, commented: ""For airlines, passenger connectivity and operational efficiency have been strategic imperatives in the past and are even more pronounced in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis. At Thales, we have used our expertise to deliver proven fast and reliable aircraft hardware and software solutions underpinned by a robust worldwide support network. Combined with SkyFive's specialism in A2G services and Nokia's mobile network infrastructure, the project will bring industry disrupting performance for passengers and airlines alike, with reliable Wi-Fi and low transmission latency delivered with low upfront investment and operational costs. We believe A2G will help to expedite the recovery of the sector by transforming the air travel experience while reducing costs as people start flying again."""

Thales Alenia Space, LeoStella and NorthStar Earth and Space launch the development and production of the early satellites for the first constellation dedicated to monitor and track space debris

Cannes, Tukwila, October 27th, 2020 – Thales Alenia Space, the Joint Venture between Thales (67 %) and Leonardo (33 %), signed the first phase of a contract with NorthStar Earth and Space Inc., the Canadian space-based information services company, to start the development and production of the first three smallsat satellites that are part of the world’s first and most advanced commercial space-based environmental and near-space monitoring system.

In November 2018, the Space Alliance, formed by Telespazio (Leonardo 67 % and Thales 33 %) and Thales Alenia Space announced to have taken a stake in NorthStar Earth and Space. Today, the industrial journey begins for the Skylark constellation, with Thales Alenia Space being responsible for the space system activities by providing the payloads alongside with LeoStella (a joint venture between BlackSky and Thales Alenia Space) providing the satellite platform and the assembly, integration and test facilities based in Tukwila for final assembly and delivery.

“Through the Space Alliance, Thales Alenia Space is proud to play a key role in the NorthStar’s success. NorthStar’s Skylark space-based system will generate unique and outstanding data to build value added services for Space Situational Awareness. Skylark signifies a first step in providing much needed timely and precise information to the satellite operators”, declared Herve Derrey, CEO of Thales Alenia Space.

The ability to view, understand and map the physical location of natural and man-made objects in orbit around the Earth (currently there are more than 600 thousand objects in low Earth orbit with billions of dollars of space assets at risk from collisions) is now becoming a real concern for all private or governmental satellite owners and operators. Tracking resident space objects from space with optical sensors will enhance and complement existing systems. By observing from multiple perspectives in space, Skylark satellites will significantly improve tracking of objects, the number of detected debris and the ability to predict potential collisions.

""NorthStar welcomes the world class expertise of Thales Alenia Space and LeoStella to our mission of delivering safe spaceflight operations in the New Space Economy. Together we look forward to achieving a future of peaceful and sustainable space for all”, added – Stewart Bain, CEO and co-founder, NorthStar Earth & Space.

The Skylark smallsats will be based on LeoStella’s LEO-100 Multi-Mission Bus and a compact optical instrument.

“The NorthStar space situational awareness constellation brings unique capabilities of free-flying Non-Earth Imaging satellites to the commercial sector. LeoStella is proud to be part of the team and to bring our multi-mission satellite platforms to support this important mission.” concluded Mike Hettich CEO of LeoStella.

LinkedIn

Thales Alenia Space has just delivered a Ka-band transponder (KaT) to the European Space Agency (ESA) for integration in the 3GM, or Gravity & Geophysics of Jupiter and Galilean Moons radio package. The 3GM is one of the instruments on Europe’s upcoming JUICE mission (JUpiter ICy moons Explorer), enabling scientists to study the gravity field at Ganymede, the extent of the internal oceans on the icy moons, and the structure of the neutral atmosphere and ionosphere of Jupiter and its moons. KaT provides highly accurate two-way range and range-rate measurements at Ka band. In turn, the gravity experiment relies on the Ka-band radio link to help unveil the interior structure of Ganymede, in particular inferring the size of the subsurface ocean by measuring the moon's gravity field and tidal response.

Our engineers and technicians have continued critical operations for our customers in recent months despite the coronavirus pandemic, while complying with all health and safety measures.

Looking into Jupiter and its icy moons

Scheduled for launch in 2022 and expected to reach Jupiter in October 2029, the JUICE spacecraft is designed and built by Airbus Defence and Space as prime contractor. An ESA mission, with a major contribution from the Italian space agency ASI, JUICE will study Jupiter and its three large, icy moons: Ganymede, Callisto and Europa.

Discovered by Galileo in 1610, the moons hold out fascinating possibilities because they’re thought to have vast oceans of water beneath their surfaces, making them potentially habitable environments. The mission will explore the surface and inner layers of the moons, investigating the conditions for the emergence of life. Thales Alenia Space’s contribution also includes the Deep Space Transponders (DST) for telemetry, tracking and command, and the Radar for Icy Moons Exploration (RIME), one of the 10 instruments.

RIME (photo of the team in January 2020) is considered a key to mission success, because of its ability to directly identify and map the internal structure of the ice layers. Using a 16-meter antenna, which is provided by Space Tech GmbH under contract to Airbus Defense and Space, and working at a central frequency of 9 MHz, RIME is designed to penetrate the ice surface down to a depth of 9 kilometers, with vertical resolution of up to 30 meters in ice, to help determine the subsurface structure of the three moons’ oceans. ASI is funding radar development, including a contribution from NASA, with the University of Trento in charge of scientific aspects.

Technology Heritage

Venus, Mars, Mercury, Saturn, the Moon, Jupiter, asteroids and comets… Thales Alenia Space’s technology is a critical part of deep space probes such as Mars Express and the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (currently in orbit around Mars); Venus Express; Cassini-Huygens (the Cassini probe completed its mission to Saturn in 2017 by burning up in the atmosphere); Rosetta, which has gathered data to characterize this comet’s environment and nucleus, thus providing clues to the origin of the Solar System; Gaia, which is mapping the Milky Way with unprecedented accuracy; Lisa Pathfinder, which paved the way for in-flight testing of gravitational wave detection; BepiColombo, now on its way to Mercury; and Solar Orbiter, which will take a close look at the Sun, in a way previously thought impossible.

All these spacecraft communicate with Earth from a distance of several Astronomical Units (millions of km) (ndt: AU = mean distance from Earth to Sun, 149.6 million km), while relying on the compact Deep Space Transponder from Thales Alenia Space, which combines state-of-art microwave technology.

KaT was designed and developed by Thales Alenia Space in Italy in cooperation with the University of Rome-La Sapienza prof. Luciano Iess, and with ASI funding, to perform a radio-science experiment. This concept draws on our experience with the Cassini mission. The Ka-band Translator was the first to use a radio-link in the Ka band (32–34 GHz), thus offering outstanding frequency stability among other advantages. This instrument enabled the Italian scientific community to verify the relativistic deflection of a radio signal fifty times more accurately than any made previously (see the article in Nature, September 25, 2003). In 2008 we supplied a KaT for NASA’s Juno mission. The KaT used on BepiColombo went even further, because it was the first radio-science device to employ an innovative broadband (50 MHz) pseudo-noise ranging technique that provided two-way range measurements to an accuracy of within a centimeter at 50 million kilometers from Earth (see “Report on first in-flight data of BepiColombo’s Mercury Orbiter Radio-science Experiment”, IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, July 2020).



The novel KaT designed and developed for JUICE (see photo) represents a further upgrade, since radiation-hardening hasbeen increased to cope with the harsh environment around Jupiter.

The naval combat of tomorrow will be collaborative - Thales,"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9ncm91cC9qb3VybmFsaXN0L21hZ2F6aW5lL25hdmFsLWNvbWJhdC10b21vcnJvdy13aWxsLWJlLWNvbGxhYm9yYXRpdmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Interview with Admiral Stéphane Verwaerde, Thales Group defence advisor (naval)

Admiral Verwaerde, when people talk about overseas military interventions, the first thing they think about is boots on the ground rather than naval operations. Does that mean the seas and oceans are calm, geopolitically speaking?

Quite the opposite. Repeated incidents in the South China Sea and recent tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean are clear reminders that the maritime space is an important nexus of confrontation when nations have conflicting ambitions. Instances of provocation and intimidation at sea are frequent, and there is an increasing risk that these tactics could lead to direct, high-intensity confrontation. It's also important to remember that maritime threats have changed a great deal in recent years. For all these reasons, maritime powers continue to invest in their fleets, and particularly in the development of new systems and weapons to counter these threats and assert their maritime sovereignty.

Can you tell us more about the new threats?

The new threats come from new types of weapons, new platforms and developments in the electromagnetic environment. Let's start with the weapons. There is now a new generation of long-range hypersonic sea-skimming or steep-dive missiles. Often fired in salvo mode, these weapons are equipped with complex guidance systems and their missile seekers are so sophisticated that current warships struggle to deal with them. The Russian Tzirkon missile, for example, has a range of 1,000 km and flies at nine times the speed of sound!

Likewise, supercavitating torpedoes are capable of travelling huge distances at speeds of more than 200 knots, compared with no more than about 50 knots* for a conventional torpedo.

As for platforms, stealth technology has come a long way in recent years. Aircraft are harder and harder to detect with radar and have smaller infrared signatures, surface ships have flat superstructures that reflect radar signals less effectively, and so on. Submarines are also becoming more and more discreet. They are covered with anechoic tiles to absorb the signals emitted by enemy sonars, and they can stay immersed for long periods thanks to new propulsion technologies like AIP (Air Independent Propulsion), which don't rely on an outside air supply.

Unmanned systems in the air, on the surface and underwater are another challenging new threat, especially when they're deployed in swarms.

The electromagnetic environment is becoming more congested and harder to manage, especially close to coastlines (5G, IoT, etc.). Even in low-level crises, naval radars, communications and satellite navigation systems are jammed more and more frequently. And cyberattacks are a major threat to maritime forces, given their reliance on high-quality data.

As you can see, it is becoming extraordinarily complex to establish and maintain maritime dominance.

How can navies respond to these increasingly sophisticated threats?

The key to success is to detect the threat early and react as quickly as possible. And detecting a threat early, particularly in a naval context, means detecting it at long range. So the conventional response is to equip warships with higher-performance sensors and effectors, such as the Sea Fire radar, which can track large numbers of targets simultaneously, very wideband sonars for submarines, long-range infrared sensors, optical systems relying on artificial intelligence to automatically recognise moving targets, and electronic warfare systems that can detect targets at long distances and automatically identify the radars used by hostile missiles and platforms.

Communications are of such huge importance that counter-jamming and area jamming capabilities are an indispensable way to deny the adversary exclusive control of the electromagnetic spectrum. And for naval units to be resilient, they need to be shielded from cyberthreats, with proven cybersecurity and warning systems and the ability to reconfigure quickly after an attack.

Are unmanned systems part of this ""conventional"" response?

Of course. Using unmanned systems increases the number of sensors we can deploy, helping us to detect threats earlier and offsetting the shortage of conventional warships. Because most Western navies have drastically reduced the number of frigates available for action, and can no longer deploy them in large numbers at the same time on the same mission in the same theatre of operations.

What about effectors?

Surface vessels can be equipped with missiles and rapid-fire guns to destroy hostile missiles or swarms of unmanned systems. Submarines can deploy underwater decoys and anti-torpedo torpedoes. There are also active electronic countermeasures, including jammers to deceive or destroy incoming missiles. Non-lethal, directed-effect weapons (laser, electromagnetic, etc.) will also be a useful way to thwart hostile detection systems, dazzle optical guidance systems or disable the electronics in incoming missiles. These weapons don't require munitions, but the vessels need large amounts of onboard electrical power. They are also effective against asymmetrical attacks by unmanned surface or air vehicles, or by swarms of small, fast boats with crews on board.

Will these enhanced capabilities be sufficient?

We need to go further. Naval combat must become collaborative. This approach is the best, if not the only, way to deal with these new threats.

In such complex environments, informational superiority — in other words, having a complete understanding of the maritime and tactical situation over as wide an area as possible — is absolutely crucial.

Keeping the upper hand in a naval combat situation can be a question of seconds. With missiles that fly at more than 3 km a second, reaction times are infinitesimally short — less than 10 seconds, compared with 30–60 seconds before.

To protect the most high-value warships (aircraft carriers, helicopter carriers, amphibious assault ships, etc.), the first thing to do is to minimise the time it takes to detect a threat. To control as wide an area as possible, this means deploying a combination of radar picket ships, unmanned air, surface and underwater systems, manned aircraft, helicopters and submarines that can operate at long distance while remaining within the range of communication systems. And to detect attacks early enough to respond, sensor quality is paramount.

Most importantly, we need to speed up the tempo of information exchanges to optimise the effectiveness of our sensors and effectors. Ships and their sensors need to interact in real time if they are to fully exploit the enormous data flows generated by today's digital sensors.

Which capabilities need to be developed to achieve this?

I see four main types: secure connectivity, data security, data storage and analytics, and artificial intelligence. These technologies are the key to processing huge and growing volumes at the speed of light. We must focus on guaranteeing the resilience and autonomy of a naval force at sea. That translates into a need for distributed ship/shore architectures, with onboard data hosting and processing capabilities and equipment that is reliable, robust and easy to deploy and use.



Are crews ready for these new challenges? Can they deal with this time pressure?

The question of crew instruction and training is extremely relevant. Until now, frigate crews, for example, underwent training at sea several times a year under real operational conditions. Today it is no longer conceivable for every crew of every ship to be trained to respond to a salvo of hypersonic missiles, for example, in the same way.

Training at sea is still indispensable, of course, but it needs to be complemented by sophisticated simulation systems. The only practical way to train ops room and bridge personnel is to combine at-sea training with simulator-based training ashore and alongside. These interconnected training solutions are crucial to the crews' ability to deal with new threats.

With a 30% lower SWaP (size, weight and power) than the other radars in its class, the new AirMaster C is compatible with more aircraft sizes and types, including naval drones, MALE UAVs, ISR aircrafts and helicopters.

The AirMaster C has already been chosen for the French joint light helicopter HIL Guépard that will equip the French Navy, Army and Air Force. According to Thales video, it seems like up to three antennas could be integrated into this military version of the Airbus H160 helicopter.

AirMaster C: the new ultra-compact radar from Thales

The AirMaster C is the latest airborne surveillance radar from Thales and has a 30% lower SWaP (size, weight and power) than the other radars in its class.

is the latest airborne surveillance radar from Thales and has a 30% lower SWaP (size, weight and power) than the other radars in its class. The AirMaster C covers the full spectrum of land, air and maritime surveillance missions and offers state-of-the-art target detection capabilities; it is the subject of preliminary integration studies on joint light helicopter (Guépard) which are in progress.

Users benefit from innovative technologies, with a unique 2D AESA antenna based on SiGe (silicon-germanium) technology, and cognitive and predictive maintenance capabilities drawing on Thales’s and the French Armament General Directorate’s investments in artificial intelligence.

“Monitor, control and protect anywhere, across land, coastline, sea and airspace”

Threat detection, identification and surveillance missions depend on a force’s ability to operate in any type of environment and all weather conditions. Drawing on its experience with the successful Master series of radars, Thales has developed a new, ultra-compact surveillance radar with enhanced target detection capabilities for fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters and UAVs. With its low integration and operating costs and high availability and performance, the AirMaster C sets a new standard for airborne radars.

The nature of armed confrontation is constantly evolving. From the intrastate conflicts of the post-Cold War period to the asymmetric threats of the early 21st century and, more recently, the resurgence of rivalries between major powers, armed forces around the world must constantly adapt as they face different types of adversaries in a diverse array of environments: open ocean, coastal areas, remote deserts and urban spaces.

AirMaster C: a concentrate of new technologies

Responding to these rapid changes, Thales has developed the AirMaster C, a new surveillance radar with an ultra-compact, programmable 2D active antenna based on SiGe (silicon-germanium) technology. SiGe is much more energy efficient than other technologies used for AESA radars, and allows the radar to self-cool. Weighing less than 20 kilograms and housed in a single unit design, the radar has a 30% lower SWaP (size, weight and power) than the other radars in this class.

In addition to this breakthrough SiGe technology, other innovations are deployed. Multi-polarisation (a capability displayed by many cameras) will allow the radar to automatically select the optimal settings to maximise detection performance on each mission. The radar also offers a simultaneous short-range and long-range detection capability, similar to the human eye, for instantaneous surveillance. With its 2D navigation and weather modes, the AirMaster C will also provide valuable navigation support in all types of environments and weather conditions.

Multi-polarisation will increase the helicopters’ ability to detect, track and target surface ships. Thales image.

The AirMaster C is a smart software-defined radar designed to reduce aircrew workload. With its autonomous sensors, self-learning functionality and the ability to analyse and classify huge volumes of data, the radar can automatically adapt to different uses, terrains and environments. The AirMaster C builds on the innovative design and proven success of the Master series.

Notified by the French Armament General Directorate (DGA), preparatory studies are being carried out by Thales in collaboration with Airbus Helicopters for the integration of the AirMaster C on board the Guépard helicopter. This is the future light joint army helicopter, which will have to carry out a wide variety of missions for the three French armies.

“We’re proud to present the latest addition to the Thales family of airborne surveillance radars, the AirMaster C, which meets the full range of current and future operational requirements. With this new product, Thales offers an optimised surveillance solution for a broader array of platform types and operators, ensuring they benefit from the highest levels of mission performance as they face the new challenges ahead.” Hervé Hamy, Vice President for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), Thales

Naval News comments

Thales depicts a naval HIL Guépard helicopter fitted with three AirMaster-C antennas. Note that the radar could also be embedded inside a medium size naval UAV. Thales image.

The HIL Guépard, in its naval version, will be able to carry the Sea Venom/ANL anti-ship missiles. Instead of a unique panoramic radar underbelly, it was stated at the begining of the program that the Guépard will be equipped with several AESA antennas, offering a 360° detection coverage around the helicopter.

With a 20 kg weight and low power consumption, the new AirMaster C will perfectly fulfill this role. According to Thales video, an AirMaster C antenna will be integrated into the Guépard nose. But some of Thales’ visuals show that two other antennas will –or could– be integrated in the rear flanks of the helicopter. Thus, with three AirMaster C antennas, the naval variant of the Guépard will be able to provide 360° surveillance, designate targets off-boresight for the Sea Venom/ANL and probably offer mid-course guidance for long range antiship missiles (i.e. Exocet) fired from a surface ship.

This multimode radar being integrated on the Air Force and Army variants of the Guépard, the Marine Nationale’s HIL will likely retain excellent air-to-ground surveillance capabilities. A very good news for the special operation forces deployed from the French navy frigates, but also for humanitarian and rescue operations performed from the sea."

And even he had trouble finding the right words for what he saw in the N.C. Independent Schools Athletic Association 2A quarterfinals.

""It was a very strange game, I thought,"" McCarthy said.

And he was right.

The 7-2 final, with Fayetteville Academy advancing past Thales Academy of Rolesville, doesn't tell the full story's most interesting details.

Both teams had trouble building up an attack, but Fayetteville Academy was helped immensely by scoring three penalty kicks on three Thales fouls in the box. Two Fayetteville Academy players (junior Anthony Sevilla and senior Scott Fincher) had hat tricks, but yet it didn't quite feel like a blowout (Arinze Ejeh also had a goal for the Eagles).

The Eagles had the better run of play but were stunned by a 40-yard quick kick before halftime to cut the lead to 4-2.

It was a weird win for a weird, COVID-19-influenced year. But now it's on to the next one for Fayetteville Academy, which has won 17 state titles in its 36 seasons.

The Eagles (7-3), the No. 1 seed in the 2A East, will host Gaston Day, the No. 3 seed from the West, in Tuesday's 2A state semifinal.

Gaston Day won last year's title. The Spartans have some history with Eagles, meeting in the 2018 championship, which Fayetteville Academy won for title No. 17.

Thales of Rolesville (8-3) finished the year with its deepest NCISAA playoff run in its young history. The Knights, seeded fourth, blew by Freedom Christian 7-1 in the previous round.

SWISSto12 has worked on the design, manufacture and test of these products with Thales Alenia Space over the last year , scheduled for GEO satellite launch in 2021. This delivery constitutes the first large scale use by SWISSto12 with TAS of 3D printed waveguide solutions for communication satellite payloads.

This result demonstrates a successful and ongoing collaboration between Thales Alenia Space and SWISSto12 for a wider use of 3D printing for RF products onboard satellites across a variety of orbits: LEO, MEO, GEO. SWISSto12 has used the design freedom offered by its technology to provide highly integrated and dense waveguide signal interconnect modules that integrate several complex waveguide runs into monolithically 3D printed equipment modules.

These custom designed products help improving the waveguide routings, thereby generating a significant benefit in terms of RF performance and system compactness. These corresponding designs would have been very challenging to produce using traditional waveguide manufacturing technologies.

With Very High Throughput Satellite (VHTS) payloads growing in complexity to deliver ever increasing amounts of data throughput, this new approach constitutes a future avenue to accommodate larger quantities of communication equipment onboard satellites. This program also confirms the success of a thorough space qualification process for GEO satellite applications completed by SWISSto12, based on the valued inputs of key customers that include Thales Alenia Space."
Another 10 Moon songs - Thales,"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbmV3cy9hbm90aGVyLTEwLW1vb24tc29uZ3PSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ah, the Moon. Our only natural satellite, orbiting Earth, timelessly marking out the seasons, progressively unveiling itself, from crescents to quarters. Isn’t it majestic when it’s round, full and shining shamelessly in the starry night sky?

Beyond our reach until 1969, today it’s a highly coveted destination, with astronauts about to set foot there again…

The Moon back in sight

Why is the Moon suddenly back in sight, when the last crewed mission to the lunar surface was Apollo 17 in 1972? Well, since then a host of scientific discoveries have made this celestial body as rare as it is precious. First, as we suspected – but it was only confirmed in 2008 – there’s water on the Moon. We’ve also found oxygen and hydrogen atoms. And these could also be extracted from the lunar ice to make rocket fuel, for example. Other resources include Helium-3, an energy-producing isotope, which could power future rockets for the next step in the space race: sending people to Mars and deep space. The Moon could serve as a staging post for even more ambitious missions to the Red Planet. What used to be the stuff of science fiction is now becoming reality.

Here at Thales Alenia Space, we have the privilege of being one of the major companies involved in the Lunar Gateway, a planned space station in lunar orbit and one of the pillars of NASA’s Artemis program, which aims to land people on the Moon by 2024. While American company CommStar Space Communications is counting on us to deploy a hybrid Earth-Moon communications relay satellite by 2023, we’ll also be supplying Earth-Moon telecom technologies for NASA’s VIPER rover, which will search for water on the surface.

As you can see, the Moon is very much part of the daily lives of our engineers specializing in space exploration. But today, it’s not technology or business we want to talk about — it’s music!

We’re passionate enthusiasts first and foremost. So, in this article we wanted to take a break from our work to look at a selection of 10 songs about the Moon — 10 songs that have influenced pop culture forever. Last year, we suggested 10 Moon songs for you to (re)discover. Today, we’re pleased to bring you another 10 lunar-inspired tracks, just because we love them and want to share them with you. So, without further ado (and not necessarily in chronological order)…

Sisters of the Moon – Fleetwood Mac

With their 1977 Rumours album, Fleetwood Mac became one of the most influential rock bands in music history. Doling out one hit after another, the record sold millions around the planet, making the five-piece lineup nothing less than a social phenomenon. Rumours has sold over 40 million copies to date, propelling it into the Top 10 best selling albums of all time. Weaving together elements of folk, rock, country, blues and stripped-down ballads, the record is truly monumental, with such legendary hits as Go Your Own Way, The Chain and Don’t Stop — used by Bill Clinton as a campaign song on numerous occasions in the run-up to the 1992 US presidential elections. But it’s the subsequent double album Tusk, released in 1979, which features the song Sisters of the Moon. After the huge success of Rumours, Tusk was seen as less accessible and was critically less well received than its predecessor. But success is relative — Tusk is no less remarkable and sold millions of copies. The track is sung by Stevie Nicks, who also had huge success with her debut solo album Bella Donna in the early 80s. Other than the title, what’s the connection with the Moon? Well, none — if you take it at face value. But the lyrics by Nicks are mystical, ghostly, esoteric. And how she delivers it is just perfect — her rasping, hypnotic voice just takes you there!



The Killing Moon – Echo & the Bunnymen

Some records are timeless, spanning the decades without aging a bit. That’s the case with Ocean Rain from Echo & the Bunnymen, released in 1984. The lead single, The Killing Moon, was a huge hit in the UK and Ireland and has since achieved cult status. The group’s frontman Ian McMulloch is well known for his sweeping statements in interview. Born in Liverpool, home of the Beatles, McMulloch said in the early 80s: “We’re the greatest band in the world, and our new album’s a masterpiece…”. And he was probably right, since they delivered three works of pure genius between 1980 and 1984: Crocodiles (1980), Porcupine (83) and Ocean Rain (84). Musically, they shift between new romanticism, in the noblest sense of the term, new wave, rock and alternative. The cold electronic soundscape was overlaid by warm string arrangements of sheer class. The singer, who co-wrote the song, attributes its astronomical associations to his childhood interest in space. And don’t you think his voice sounds a lot like Bono’s? Soundwise somewhere between The Cure, U2 and The Verve, this Echo & the Bunnymen record transcends time, largely thanks to its rich orchestration and refined string arrangements. Sublime!

Man on the Moon – R.E.M.

After the huge success of their 1991 album Out of Time, featuring the planetary hits Shiny Happy People and Losing My Religion, R.E.M. released an absolute masterpiece in 1992, winning acclaim from critics and fans alike. Automatic for the People contains several sumptuous tracks, not least Everybody Hurts. The record has a restrained, acoustic feel, melancholic in places, but never gloomy. Lead singer Michael Stipe brilliantly combines desolation, quality lyrics and elegant yet understated music. The album, with its timeless production values, contains a real gem, Man on the Moon, which pays homage to American comedian Andy Kaufman, who died in 1984, long before his time. In 1999, movie director Miloš Forman — who also brought us One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest and Amadeus — shot a biopic on Kaufman, with Jim Carrey in the lead role. The movie’s title was directly inspired by the R.E.M. track.

Bad Moon Rising – Creedence Clearwater Revival

Change of register, we’re now back in 1969. One of the most famous groups of the time was Creedence Clearwater Revival. Formed in San Francisco, home of flower power and the beat generation, Creedence was a long way from the psychedelic pop and rock movements coming out of the West Coast. And far from the pop and folk melodies of the Mamas and the Papas, the Byrds or Scott McKenzie. Soundwise, their style was direct and unembellished. CCR was a well-oiled machine, the musicians true professionals. They were much closer to southern rockers Lynyrd Skynyrd, who brought us Simple Man and Sweet Home Alabama, or Jefferson Airplane. What do you think Bad Moon Rising was referring to, given events at the time? A thinly veiled critique of the Nixon administration, the song — unsettling in places — hints at The Times They Are A-Changin’ by Bob Dylan and especially the Vietnam War, which America was embroiled in from 1963 to 1975. This engaging song was the group’s second-biggest hit, just behind Proud Mary.

Moonlight Shadow – Mike Oldfield ft. Maggie Reilly

One of the more surprising songs in our list, but we’re sure you know it. Moonlight Shadow was played all the time on FM stations in Europe for years. But did you really listen to the lyrics? When Maggie Reilly sings “carried away by a moonlight shadow” it’s a direct reference to death. It’s a poetic metaphor for the other side of the mirror. It echoes the line “break on through to the other side” by the Doors. When genius English multi-instrumentalist Mike Oldfield enlisted Reilly for vocal duties, he asked her to approach it with “the lightness of a butterfly”. Moonlight Shadow is laden with contradictions, torn between the bounciness of the melody — it’s a pop ballad with Celtic influences — the softness of Reilly’s delivery and the thinly veiled violence of the lyrics: “he was shot six times by a man on the run”. It was released to the airwaves in 1983, three years after John Lennon’s murder in the archway of the Dakota, his residence in New York City. Oldfield must have been unconsciously influenced by Lennon’s death as he wrote Moonlight Shadow, but there’s little proof. Either way, it remains his greatest commercial success to date, even ahead of Tubular Bells, a masterpiece of instrumental progressive rock with Celtic influences. The opening theme of that album was used for the soundtrack of William Friedkin’s super-scary 1973 horror movie, The Exorcist.

The Whole of the Moon – The Waterboys

“I saw the crescent / You saw the whole of the Moon” — now there’s a punchline that’s hit home in its time. If you’re not familiar with this track, listen to This is the Sea, the 1985 album by The Waterboys. It was one of the most brilliant albums of the year. The sound of the band’s early albums became known as “Big Music”. The records are extremely well produced, epic, grandiose in the noblest sense of the word, heroic and lyrical. The arrangements are so meticulous, you’d think the album came out last week. The voice of Scottish lead singer Mike Scott does the rest. The soundscape is similar to U2’s Unforgettable Fire and the early albums by Simple Minds, with resolutely pop/rock content and Celtic influences in places. Their next album Fisherman’s Blues, released in 1988 and equally brilliant, marked a sea change in their sound and is a genuine Celtic rock production. The Whole of the Moon is their greatest commercial success. Aided by Mike Scott’s charisma, The Waterboys certainly deserve a global reputation, don’t you think?

Pink Moon – Nick Drake

Some artists never gain the recognition they deserve. And Nick Drake was one of them. This extremely talented young English singer-songwriter recorded three excellent studio albums. All three were commercial failures, but all three have since been included in the 1,000 greatest albums of all time. Pink Moon is the third and final album by this hugely talented artist, who died at just 26. The clarity of his guitar playing, with such a delicate plucking style, and the poetry of the lyrics have earned Drake significant posthumous popularity as a timeless cult artist. His unmistakable style sets him apart from other folk singers of the time. The extremely minimalist, uncluttered arrangements give the impression it was recorded only recently. It hasn’t aged a bit, though it came out in 1972. In 1999, the title track was used for a TV ad for a Volkswagen convertible. This led to a surge in record sales and chart success, albeit 27 years too late. It just goes to show: when a song is genuinely great it can resurface years later to reach new generations. And that’s exactly what Pink Moon has done.



Marquee Moon – Television

Marquee Moon is probably the longest “Moon song” of all time, or at least one of them. It runs for 10 minutes 40 seconds, during which two furious guitars battle it out. Released in 1977, Marquee Moon is an excellent record from the post-punk period — up there with Horses by Patti Smith or Talking Heads 77, their debut album. Tom Verlaine (born Thomas Miller) really is at the controls of this album, writing all the lyrics and music. A literature buff, Verlaine grew up devouring the poems and novels of Bill Knott, Rilke, Hamsun and Lautréamont. With Marquee Moon, he set the bar high, garnering the acclaim of rock critics, despite a mixed reception from the public. The album marked a break with all that had gone before. Indeed, you might say there’s a before Marquee Moon and after. The New York sound was deliberately cold, even glacial, and urban. But it’s all in there — lyrics, music, handpicked musicians. Marquee Moon is deemed one of the best albums of 1977. If you like Lou Reed, Velvet Underground, Talking Heads and The Strokes, you’ll definitely be impressed by this first, highly ambitious record from Television.



Child of the Moon – The Rolling Stones

It’s not the best known song by the Rolling Stones. Released as the B-side to the global hit single Jumping Jack Flash, Child of the Moon contains some cryptic lyrics and strange, psychedelic music. It’s often interpreted as an enigmatic declaration of love by Mick Jagger to Marianne Faithfull. Recorded in 1968, the song, with its meticulous orchestration, is a mix of blues rock and Cajun rock. And with its poetic words and rhythmical music, rather melancholic in places, Child of the Moon is one of the forgotten treasures of the Stones back catalogue. If you’re a fan, well worth a (re)play!



Moonage Daydream – David Bowie

We couldn’t end this list without a nod to David Bowie. Last year, if you remember, we looked at Space Oddity — and for good reason. The song had been used by the BBC for its live coverage of the Apollo 11 lunar landing in 1969. Bowie had always been passionate about science fiction and wrote numerous songs about space: Life on Mars, Ashes to Ashes, Starman and Ziggy Stardust to name just a few. The song we look at today is Moonage Daydream, which appears on The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, the album that established Bowie as a legend. Prior to Ziggy Stardust, Bowie had achieved some success but was struggling to find his musical identity. But was this really what he was trying to do, since none of his albums was like anything before it? Having oscillated between folk, blues and pop, Bowie was now propelled to the rank of international superstar in the Glam Rock genre, alongside such artists as Marc Bolan of T. Rex and the members of Roxy Music. And with Ziggy Stardust, he raised the bar. It wasn’t just a record but a concept album, like The Wall by Pink Floyd or Melody Nelson from Serge Gainsbourg. The story has all the makings of a sci-fi movie. Earth only has five years left before it will be destroyed (hence the track Five Years). Suddenly, alien Ziggy Stardust arrives on the planet with his Spiders from Mars, becomes a rock star, descends into excess of every kind, then finally ends his days (in Rock ‘n’ Roll Suicide). A musical feat that just had to be attempted, without resorting to overdramatization. Bowie rose to the challenge most convincingly, writing all the tracks except one and working with a genius guitarist and arranger in the person of Mick Ronson. The album is excellent, and the song Moonage Daydream, with its incredible guitar playing, is a strong track. Make no mistake, the album is much more complex than it first appears. Bowie’s voice transforms from one track to the next. He also addresses more serious issues, pays homage to the suffragettes with Suffragette City and decries Earth’s fragility and decline with Five Years (you could draw a parallel today with the direct impact of climate change on our planet…). Ziggy Stardust propelled Bowie to the lofty heights of success, which it took him years to get used to and where he shall forever remain.

There are so many other Moon songs as well. We could cite Blue Moon by Beck, Half Moon by Janis Joplin, Mountains of the Moon by the Grateful Dead, New Moon on Monday by Duran Duran, Mr Moonlight by the Beatles or the albums Moondance by Van Morrison and Moon Safari from French electro band Air.

Paving the way for more women in engineering - Thales,"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9jb3VudHJpZXMtYXNpYS9hdXN0cmFsaWEvcmVmZXJlbmNlcy9wYXZpbmctd2F5LW1vcmUtd29tZW4tZW5naW5lZXJpbmfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Meet Katrina Leung - a Bachelor of Engineering student at University of Technology Sydney (UTS) and recipient of the Women in Engineering and Information Technology (IT) Cooperative scholarship sponsored by Thales.

For Katrina, the possibility of a career in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) began when she chose Information and Software Technology as an elective subject in Year 9. From there, Katrina learned Python programming, tried her hand at HTML and CSS and then applied these skills to design a website centring around a passion of hers; volleyball. This success and progress inspired Katrina to establish a coding club at her school, which gradually evolved into a STEM club where she started experimenting with robotics kits; something that carried her to thinking of engineering as a potential career pathway.

Fast forward to the beginning of Year 12 and Katrina decided to apply for a UTS Women in Engineering and IT scholarship. The WiEIT Co-op Scholarship is a cooperative education program between the University and sponsoring organisations, such as Thales. “Having Women in Engineering and IT scholars sponsored by Thales has further strengthened our long-term partnership that already includes school outreach and the Lucy Mentoring Program. Our scholars are role models in our community, both to our students and staff.’’ said Arti Agrawal, Director of UTS Women in Engineering and IT.

The aim of the program is to attract, retain and develop women in the fields of Engineering and Information Technology (IT). The scholarship identifies high potential female students who have a passion and interest to pursue a career in Engineering or IT. The scholarship includes three industry placements as well as mentoring, networking, leadership and professional development opportunities.

Katrina attended an on-campus interview during her school holidays and met with a UTS representative and Thales Australia Avionics Technical Director Phil Swadling, as industry sponsor.

“I was really impressed by all the applicants, their energy and enthusiasm was inspiring. In particular, I was struck by how clearly they were able to articulate why they wanted to study engineering, and how they wanted to use the skills and knowledge they would gain from their studies.”

Katrina received the good news that she was the successful applicant and recalls feeling shocked. “I wouldn’t have considered myself as a ‘techie’ person. I just applied because it was an opportunity and so I went for it.”

Life at university and Thales

Katrina is now in her second year at UTS and majoring in Mechanical and Mechatronics engineering. Her Thales sponsored scholarship offers financial support, industry experience, mentoring, networking and leadership and professional development.

While the benefits of having tertiary fees paid for are obvious, the internships at Thales are proving to be just as valuable.

Katrina says her three-month summer internship at the Thales Rydalmere site earlier this year taught her more than she expected about the world of engineering and Thales. “I knew by looking online that Thales was a multinational company working mainly in Defence and aerospace, but only really discovered the Underwater Systems part of the business when I started my internship.”

Katrina has spent most of her time at Thales working with 3D modelling and says the experience was insightful for many reasons. “I didn’t have much experience working in 3D modelling at uni. We only had an introductory 2-3 weeks on it so it was really nice to be able to see it in action in a workplace.” The internship also gave Katrina a sense of what skills may be useful for the future as she ponders various career paths after graduation including the potential of working at Thales and possibly Defence.

Another area Katrina is interested in is the mechanics behind prosthetic limbs and mechatronics in sports training, which stems from Katrina’s hobby of coaching and playing volleyball. Katrina recently watched a YouTube clip from Japan where they used a robotic block machine to assist with volleyball training and the notion of combining engineering with sports as a career became real. “I think there’s enough time to go around and figure out what it’s like in these different areas. They might all fall under engineering but it takes trial and error to see which discipline really suits me.”

Either way, Katrina knows the 3D modelling experience gained at Thales will come in handy regardless of which career option she pursues and, if you ask her, this is the beauty of an internship.

“I think having internships in any degree or discipline is like checkpoints to make sure you enjoy what you’re doing and you know what to expect. The experience is pretty fun as well, there’s nothing to lose by finding out what it’s really like in the workplace.""

Katrina will return to Thales in January 2021 for another six months and, though the placement location isn’t confirmed, she is hopeful that it’s Rydalmere again so she can catch up with everyone and potentially work with the simulations team."

SPAINSAT NG programme successfully passes Preliminary Design Review (PDR)

• Important milestone successfully achieved on schedule despite Covid-19

• Spanish industry assumes leadership of communications payload for first time, including integration of both satellites’ payloads in Spain

• Advanced technologies for Next Generation secure communications satellites

@AirbusSpace @Thales_Alenia_S #Hisdesat @Defensagov #SpaceMatters #SpaceforLife @esa @Partner_InOrbit

Madrid, 22 October 2020 – The SPAINSAT NG programme, owned and operated by Hisdesat, has successfully passed the preliminary design review (PDR) of the payloads and the full satellite, including PDR of Pacis 3 elements. SPAINSAT NG is being manufactured by a consortium of four co-primes from Airbus in Spain and France, and Thales Alenia Space in Spain and France.

This important milestone confirms the soundness of the preliminary design and technical capabilities of the SPAINSAT NG satellite system.

It was achieved in the expected timeframe despite the difficulties caused by the Covid-19 health crisis, thanks to the commitment of all project teams who have continued to work at full capacity, combining remote work with face-to-face activity in the workplace.

“Successfully passing the satellite and payloads PDR, including Pacis 3, in the planned schedule shows the outstanding commitment and performances of all the teams working in this challenging program. I really much appreciate the efforts of anyone, from our main end customer and partner in the SPAINSAT NG PPP the Spanish Ministry of Defense and the Spanish Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism as lender of the program, till CDTI, ESA, Hisdesat, Airbus DS, Thales Alenia Space and the rest of the industry working in the program”, said Miguel A. García Primo, Hisdesat CEO.

The SPAINSAT NG programme comprises two satellites, SPAINSAT NG I and II which will be situated in different geostationary positions to operate in X, military Ka and UHF bands.

The communication payloads of both satellites are provided by Spanish industry, including integration of the Communications Module in Spain, a major step forward for Spanish industry. Airbus in Spain is responsible for the X band payload, while Thales Alenia Space in Spain is responsible for the UHF and Ka band payloads. Other companies from Spanish space industry are also involved. The UHF payload is a new development in Spain, positioning the country at the forefront of the few countries in the world with national systems in the military UHF band.

The satellites are based on the Eurostar Neo platform, Airbus’ new geostationary telecommunications satellite product, a significant evolution of the highly reliable and successful Eurostar series with an entire range of major innovations. SPAINSAT NG includes an X band fully flexible payload, employing active antennas with in orbit reconfiguration capability, an onboarddigital processor that will interconnect the X and Ka band payloads for cross-banding, and a dedicated high speed service link enabling fast re-configuration.

“The successful PDR is an important milestone for the development of the SPAINSAT NG programme, which is on-track and on-schedule thanks to the huge professionalism and commitment of the project team,” said Eduardo Bellido, CEO of Thales Alenia Space in Spain. “For the first time we lead in Spain the development and integration of the payloads for a programme like SPAINSAT NG, which positions us at the forefront of space technology with the capacity to integrate large space systems. This will allow us to take the lead of new payloads and instruments in future missions.”



“Spain has always been at the centre of Airbus’ space activities. This milestone represents an extraordinary achievement as it clearly validates we have succeeded in further developing our expertise and capabilities on new technologies,” said Fernando Varela, Head of Airbus Space in Spain. “We are now ready for the next stage and on track with the integration of the communication modules in our clean rooms.”

The development of SPAINSAT NG is supported by the Spanish Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI) in the framework of a Partnership Project (PP) between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the satellite operator Hisdesat, called Pacis 3.

ESA Partnership Project supports the development and integration of innovative satellite payload elements, such as the reconfigurable transmit and receive X-band active antennas, and the deployable pallet with individually steerable Ka-band antennas. The Partnership Project will de-risk the partner’s investments to answer market needs through the development of sustainable end-to-end system up to in-orbit validation. It will also demonstrate novel pooling and sharing concepts to ultimately provide more affordable, flexible and secure communications services for governmental users in Europe.

“The Pacis 3 Partnership Project with Hisdesat is an important step within the Govsatcom Precursor project, part of ESA’s Space Systems for Safety and Security Program” stated Elodie Viau, ESA’s Director of Telecommunications and Integrated Applications. “Pacis 3 shows how the European space industry can respond to a globally emerging market of secure satellite communications. Partnership Projects, provide an effective and collaborative environment to introduce innovative systems and services, up to in-orbit validation.”

New AIT facility

The construction of a new clean room in Thales Alenia Space site in Madrid is progressing on-schedule to be ready for the SPAINSAT NG payload assembly, integration and test activities. This unique, cutting-edge facility in Spain will add more than 600 m2 clean area to the existing 2000 m2. With a free height of 12.5 meters in the inside, the facility is equipped with bridge cranes with lifting capacity up to 12 tons each, prepared for the integration of payloads and instruments of large dimensions for all type of space missions, spanning telecommunications, navigation, Earth observation and science.

The first of these New Generation SPAINSAT satellites will be launched at the end of 2023 and the second one a year later, guaranteeing the continuity of secure communications services.

The SPAINSAT NG satellites will have an operational lifetime of 15 years, remaining in service up to 2039.

Montréal-based NorthStar announced Oct. 27 that Thales will build its first three Skylark satellites, working in conjunction with LeoStella, its smallsat manufacturing joint venture with BlackSky. The satellites, based on LeoStella’s LEO-100 bus and assembled at its factory near Seattle, are scheduled for launch in 2022. The companies did not disclose terms of the satellite contract.

Each satellite, operating in a polar orbit at an altitude of 575 kilometers, will carry an optical payload that will scan orbits ranging from low Earth orbit to geostationary orbit to track satellites. NorthStar plans to use those observations to provide customers with space situational awareness (SSA) services.

NorthStar has been working on this concept for several years, originally pitching it as a dual-use system, with satellites also carrying hyperspectral sensors for Earth observation. The Skylark satellites, though, will be devoted to SSA.

“We’ve convinced ourselves that we’re in a good place with clients, with our partners, with our manufacturing plant. It’s time to start building the satellites and start getting the services up and running,” Stewart Bain, chief executive of NorthStar, said in an interview.

The three satellites ordered now are the beginning of a constellation of at least 12 NorthStar plans to launch by 2024. Bain said the company will launch them three at a time into different orbital planes to enhance its coverage.

NorthStar is entering an increasingly crowded market for SSA and related services. Companies like ExoAnalytics and LeoLabs already provide SSA data using ground-based telescopes and radars, and use that data to provide services for satellite operators and other customers. Others, like AGI’s Commercial Space Operations Center, take data from a variety of sources to provide space traffic management services.

Bain said that NorthStar’s key difference is that its data will come from satellites. “The perspective of space gives you high revisit on objects, and filling out the whole view of space and everything that is going on in space is done in a matter of hours,” he claimed. “Because we’re in space we’re not limited by atmosphere and weather.”

He declined to specify how small of an object that the system will be able to track other than it will be able to see those that are “multiple centimeter sized.” The newest radars operated by LeoLabs can track objects as small as two centimeters across in LEO, the company has stated.

Bain expects the service to win business from both commercial and government organizations. That includes the U.S. Office of Space Commerce, which is tasked with space traffic management responsibilities and is working on what it calls an “open architecture data repository” that will combine SSA data from a variety of sources. “We’re very motivated to support the U.S.’s endeavors in space traffic management and provide them with necessary information to do that,” he said.

NorthStar raised $65 million in 2018, and Bain said the company’s current funding is sufficient to start work on the Skylark system. The company declined to discuss any ongoing fundraising efforts, citing restrictions in Canadian law.

While the initial satellites are focused on SSA, NorthStar has not ruled out pursuing Earth observation, part of its original plans, in the future. Hyperspectral imagers, Bain said, would require far more capital to develop, hence the initial focus on SSA. “Raising the capital necessary for 40 satellites with hyperspectral imagers is a much bigger challenge.”

“Launching the SSA system allows us to become a revenue generating enterprise rather than just a startup,” he said. “We felt the right focus was to get the Skylark system up and running, be the first in space, deliver the services. There is a demand for that right now.”"
Thales Alenia Space to deliver Europe’s main modules for lunar space station - SatelliteProME.com,"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vc2F0ZWxsaXRlcHJvbWUuY29tL25ld3MvdGhhbGVzLWFsZW5pYS1zcGFjZS10by1kZWxpdmVyLWV1cm9wZXMtbWFpbi1tb2R1bGVzLWZvci1sdW5hci1zcGFjZS1zdGF0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The station, weighing about 40 metric tons, will be automatically assembled piece by piece in a near rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO) around the moon.

The European Space Agency has chosen Thales Alenia Space to develop two key modules for the upcoming Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway (LOP-G) de la NASA. These are the I-HAB (International Habitat) and the ESPRIT communications and refuelling module.

These two modules are the European contribution for this Gateway. The first tranche of I-HAB contract, (worth $42.2m) has been signed with the European Space Agency (ESA), while ESPRIT development has already started under Authorisation To Proceed (ATP) with a contract signature expected by the end of the year.

This Gateway, a manned lunar orbital infrastructure, is one of the pillars of NASA’s Artemis programme, designed to return humans to the moon by 2024. It is being implemented through international cooperation, currently involving NASA (United States), ESA (Europe), JAXA (Japan) and CSA (Canada) with each partner in charge of the development of complementary elements, to be assembled and operated in lunar orbit as from 2024.

The station, weighing about 40 metric tons, will be automatically assembled piece by piece in a near rectilinear halo orbit (NRHO) around the moon. The final configuration is still partly under final consolidation, but it will mainly comprise habitation modules for the crew, docking capabilities for visiting vehicles and the Orion space capsule, logistics modules, communications with the Earth and Moon, EVA airlocks for scientific experiments and crew extravehicular activities (EVA), as well as a robotic arm.

It is not intended for permanent occupancy but will be able to host four-person crews for periods of one to three months. Gaining new experiences on and around the moon will prepare NASA to send the first humans to Mars in the coming years, and the Gateway will play a vital role in this process.

I-HAB will mark the transition from the ISS to a new generation of space infrastructures for deep space exploration. It will meet evolving requirements and performances for lighter structures and optimized micrometeorites protection system evolved docking systems and hatches, enhanced functional and avionic architectures, more efficient thermal control system with deployable radiators to ensure full autonomous capability of heat rejection, innovative conditioning systems. The I-HAB will experience for the first time long exposure in the deep space environment, offering the opportunity to test and prove potential design solutions for protection against cosmic radiations. Being unmanned for most of its time on orbit, it will also require dedicated solutions for the robotic operations, either on board or externally.

One of the key evolving steps with respect to the ISS will be focussed on designing, with the support of virtual reality technique, more comfortable internal accommodations, with the exploitation of modular and reconfigurable solutions to optimise room and comfort for the crew.

The module will be provided by Europe with contributions from the other space agencies like environmental and life support system from JAXA, avionics and software parts from NASA and robotic components from CSA; the integration of all these elements in I-HAB will leverage on the large experience already acquired by Thales Alenia Space during the ISS Nodes 2 and 3 activities already developed in cooperation. I-HAB is slated for launch in 2026.

ESPRIT (European System Providing Refueling, Infrastructure and Telecommunications) consists in two main elements. The first, named HLCS (Halo Lunar Communication System), ensures the communications between the Gateway and the moon. The launch is planned for 2024 with HALO, the first habitation and logistics module, supplied by the US, and derived from the Cygnus resupply cargo, for which Thales Alenia Space has been selected to provide its primary structure and micrometeoroid protection system.

ESPRIT includes a second part named ERM (ESPRIT Refueling Module) which combines the refuelling of the Gateway with a small pressurised module with windows. ERM will provide active refuelling of the Gateway with xenon and chemical propellants to extend its life but also prepare for re-usable Lunar Lander or Deep Space Transport (to Mars).

ERM’s pressurised tunnel provides wide windows offering a 360° view on space, moon, earth and on the Gateway. This pressurised volume will also contain various logistics and other elements for the crew. Delivery is planned for 2026, with launch the following year.

Commenting on the contract, Hervé Derrey, CEO of Thales Alenia Space said: “We would like to thank our customer ESA for continuing to place their trust in our ability to build Europe’s two main contributions to the lunar space station, as well as national space agencies in particular CNES and ASI for their support in these two programs. Through our contributions to the ISS, the Axiom commercial space station and now the lunar space station, we are expanding the possibilities in this field, not only in terms of technology but also for the safety and comfort of astronauts.”

Massimo Claudio Comparini Senior Executive Vice President Observation, Exploration and Navigation at Thales Alenia Space, added: “Through these contracts, Thales Alenia Space will call on the full sum of our expertise to expand our knowledge base and push back the frontiers of the cislunar exploration. Looking further ahead, this space station will be a jumping-off point for future human missions into deep space, including Mars.”"

Alongside the –already well-known– SeaFire radar, the new TSA 6000 IFF will be integrated into the electronic warfare suite of the future Amiral Ronarc'h-class, the French Navy version of the FDI.

Thales press release

Thales launches the world’s first fixed-panel IFF system for the French Navy’s future frigates

Thales is unveiling the TSA6000, the first IFF interrogator to use flat fixed-array active antenna technology. This new solution, unique in the world, provides 360° coverage around the vessel, with no trade-off in range capabilities, and an unprecedented and extremely fast identification capability.

Identifying air targets after they have been detected is crucially important in the theatre of operations. To meet this need of the Forces, Thales is unveiling the TSA6000, the latest addition to its family of IFF (identification friend or foe) interrogators.

The fully digital TSA6000 comprises four fixed antenna panels to provide 360° coverage and unprecedented identification performance.

Smaller, lighter and more efficient than a rotating antenna system, the interrogator can identify targets extremely quickly and is set to revolutionise IFF identification.

Naval forces today need to be able to rely on new technology to make the best decisions when it matters most. Thales helps them conduct their missions more safely at every critical moment, building on its air surveillance expertise and in-depth knowledge of operational contexts to develop high-value end-to-end IFF solutions.

A revolutionary fixed-panel technology

Based on a revolutionary all-digital flat fixed-array technology, the TSA6000 IFF identification system provides a smart 360° electronic scanning (or e-scan) capability enabling extremely fast identification of new types of threats.The four-panel antenna design allows full 360° coverage, overcoming the problem of signal masking caused by a ship’s topside infrastructure, especially if it has multiple masts. Smaller and lighter, the TSA6000 is much easier for systems integrators to position and install on a vessel compared to IFF systems with rotating array antennas or fixed cylindrical arrays.

On the FDI, the PSIM (Panoramic Sensors and Intelligence Module) integrated the ESM suite, the Sea Fire radar and the new TSA6000 IFF.

The TSA6000’s panels are independent from the radar system for even greater flexibility of installation and maintenance. Its modular, scalable all-digital architecture also simplifies support operations significantly: each panel comprises multiple modules for built-in redundancy and to help ensure the system is permanently available. In addition, the system has no mechanical or rotating parts, considerably increasing reliability and reducing time to repair.

The TSA6000 is compliant with Mode 5, the new NATO secure identification standard. With this new product, Thales offers an ultra high-performance identification capability with guaranteed interoperability between NATO and allied forces for the decades ahead.

A comprehensive communication and electronic warfare suite for the FDI frigates

The TSA6000 will equip the French Navy’s future FDI-class frigates from 2021 alongside the Sea Fire radar from Thales, which also has a flat-panel array. The radar / IFF combination will offer a near- instantaneous detection and identification capability against high-velocity threats.

As a global market leader in IFF identification, Thales provides a complete range of IFF solutions to meet the current and future needs of the armed forces. To date, over 20,000 IFF devices from Thales have been installed on 100 different types of land, air and naval platforms in 70 countries.

The TSA6000 is the latest addition to the Thales family of IFF products and meets the full range of current and future operational requirements. With its unique digital architecture, it is designed to evolve in line with emerging requirements and future threats. We’re proud to be providing state- of-the-art and ever more innovative solutions to ensure the highest levels of protection for the armed forces and help them conduct their operations safely.

Naval News comments

Alongside the Sea Fire radar and the new TSA 6000 IFF, Thales is supplying Aquilon, a secure, integrated and digital naval communications system that guarantees connectivity and interoperability for the frigate and its crew. One of the main components of this system is PARTNER-C, the latest iteration of the PARTNER range of communication management systems which was unveiled last year. According to Thales, PARTNER-C has a new intuitive man-machine interface adapted to sailors accustomed to consumer communications technologies. COMTICS, which Thales described as “the sailor’s smartphone”, will also be available on the frigate. The dual-band SURFSAT-L stations and the HF XL, a new generation of HF radios, will give the FDI enhanced long-distance connectivity in all circumstances.

Thales aboard FDI frigate. At the beginning of the program (FDI was then the FTI), the IFF was only appointed as part of the “BlueGate” family.

All these previous systems were already displayed by Thales on previous editions of Euronaval and other international exhibitions. Their integration aboard the FDI was well know since the beginning of the program. But it is the first time that Thales unveiled details about the IFF system that will be coupled with the fixed panel AESA radar Sea Fire. Until now, it was only known that the FDI’s IFF will be a solution from Thales’ BlueGate family.

Finally, it seems that the FDI frigates will be equipped with an entirely new IFF system. Fixed-panel radar and IFF will provide a better 360° real-time air-defense coverage. This increase in performance will be needed in the next decades. Indeed, the FDI frigates are designed to deal with new generation threats, such as hypersonic missiles, stealth aircrafts and swarms of UAVs."

The Pressurized Cargo Module (PCM), developed by Thales Alenia Space, on a new resupply mission to ISS, with approximately 3,600 kg of precious cargo on board

Turin, October 3rd, 2020 – The Cygnus spacecraft, dedicated to deliver supplies to the International Space Station (ISS), has been successfully launched by an Antares rocket from Wallops Island, Virginia, on its 14th operational mission. Cygnus comprises two main elements: a Service Module, built by Northrop Grumman, and an enhanced Pressurized Cargo Module (PCM), developed and built by Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%). Northrop Grumman also builds the Antares rocket.

Since 2013, Cygnus missions have been the main enabler of the safe resupply of the International Space Station, a lifeline designed to transport the fundamental cargo, including oxygen, water, scientific experiments, crew supplies, and spare parts. Since the end of 2015, the enhanced Cygnus configuration features a more efficient design, able to accommodate more payload weight (over 3,500 kg) and volume.

Each resupply mission to the ISS contains crew supplies and vehicle hardware but also increasingly carries scientific investigations in the areas of biology and biotechnology, Earth and space science, physical sciences, and technology development and demonstrations.

The newly launched spacecraft is carrying a new raft of experiments such as Plant Habitat-02, dedicated to the Assessment of Nutritional Value and Growth Parameters of Space-grown Plants, which will cultivate radishes as a model plant that is nutritious and edible. This investigation is critical for NASA’s human exploration of the Moon and Mars. Two other experiments will be carried by Cygnus’s PCM: the Universal Waste Management System (UWMS) will demonstrate the technology for a compact toilet for astronauts and an investigation from the University of Puerto Rico will test oxidation of ammonia in microgravity as a potential means of producing water and energy to be used on deep-space exploration missions.

The Cygnus’s PCM will also carry an health investigation named Leveraging Microgravity to Screen Onco-selective Messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) for Cancer Immunotherapy that will test a biologic drug that could be used for the treatment of leukemia. As part of “the ISS Experience”, a cinematic virtual reality (VR) series documenting life and research aboard the space station, Cygnus’ PCM is carrying a 360 degree virtual reality camera which is set to capture a spacewalk in cinematic virtual reality as well as a footage of Earth and the exterior of the space station.

As an outpost of humanity in space, the ISS, for which Thales Alenia Space provided 50% of the pressurized modules, represents the largest and most complex space laboratory ever built, permanently inhabited for past twenty years, defying the difficult rules of physics, metrology, astronomy and interplanetary flight. The constant presence of astronauts in orbit is possible thanks to pressurized modules, that allow life and scientific research in the microgravity environment, and the development of useful technologies and knowledge, not only for space exploration, but to improve our life on Earth – in line with Thales Alenia Space for Life aspiration.

Thales Alenia Space has supplied cargo modules to Northrop Grumman since the start of the Cygnus program. The first contract in 2009 was for the delivery of nine modules, while a second contract in 2016 added nine more. Fourteen operational PCMs plus a demo module have been launched to date, four in the original version and eleven in the enhanced version.

In a five-minute span of the first half during Thursday’s second-round NCISAA 2-A playoff game, Fayetteville Academy scored four goals on the way to a 6-0 win over Thales Academy of Apex.

“The first 15-20 minutes were probably the best we’ve played all season,” Eagles coach Andrew McCarthy said. “We prepared well and I was hoping for a good start and we certainly got that.”

After shaking off some early playoff jitters, Fayetteville Academy settled in and began to attack. Anthony Sevilla was firing crosses into the box, Curran Haworth controlled the pace, Arinze Ejeh set up Sevilla with a nifty serve over the middle that wound up in the keeper’s mitts.

RECAP: Fayetteville Academy earns ‘beautiful,’ ‘lovely’ OT win to open 2020 season

The Eagles broke through just over 15 minutes into action as Haworth converted a corner kick from Colin Martin to give Fayetteville Academy a 1-0 lead.

The goals came easily after that.

At the 23-minute mark, Martin skimmed a low free kick into the back of the net and Hunter Herman headed in a rebound to put the Eagles up 3-0.

Sevilla, who had been antagonizing Thales’ defenders all game, got on the receiving end of a clear from Haworth, dribbled himself open and buried a goal to cap the five-minute outburst.

Scott Fincher and Bryant Birch added second-half goals.

“We played beautifully out there,” said Herman, one of four seniors on the Eagles’ roster. “The passes, the tackling, the intensity — that’s really what’s going to get us to finals.”

Finals are a familiar place for Fayetteville Academy.

The Eagles have won 17 state championships over the last 35 years, their most recent coming on a repeat title in 2018.

Duncan Ferguson, a senior defender, believes this squad can add to the tally.

“We can win the ‘ship,” he said.

“I thought this was one of our best games. Everybody gave as much as they could on the field to show that we are coming for the championship.

“We need to stay humble but we do have confidence.”

The Eagles are 6-3 after Thursday’s victory, with all three losses coming to the top two seeds in the 3-A East.

Fayetteville carries its No. 1 2-A East seed into a quarterfinal matchup Saturday at home against No. 4 Thales Academy of Rolesville (8-2), which defeated Freedom Christian 7-1 on Thursday.

“Luckily, everyone seems to be fit and fresh and we’re playing well at the right time,” McCarthy said.

“Normally, you’d have 18 or 19 games and we’ve only had nine. I think we’re as fresh as we’ve been.”

Thales and Nexter to equip French Navy ships with a new generation of artillery - EDR Magazine,"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmV1L3RoYWxlcy1hbmQtbmV4dGVyLXRvLWVxdWlwLWZyZW5jaC1uYXZ5LXNoaXBzLXdpdGgtYS1uZXctZ2VuZXJhdGlvbi1vZi1hcnRpbGxlcnnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"October 27th 2020 – The RAPIDFire system developed by the consortium formed by Thales and Nexter has been chosen by the French defence procurement agency (DGA) to equip future French Navy vessels with new artillery.. This new system will provide the Navy’s surface vessels with an effective close-in defence capability against modern air and surface threats. RAPIDFire is an innovative, versatile close-in weapon system designed to protect naval vessels against modern air and surface threats.

Naval forces are exposed to several threats with complex behaviours, such as unmanned air and surface vehicles, light aircraft and missiles. RAPIDFire leverages the combined expertise of Thales and Nexter to meet the very short-range defence requirements of the armed forces. The solution features a latest-generation multi-threat (air and surface), multi-environment (land and naval) gun system, with a cost of engagement commensurate with the value of the threats.

RAPIDFire is a gun system that offers high precision thanks to its optronic fire control system integrated onto the turret, its advanced algorithms, powerful gun and automatic ammunition management system allowing the best reactivity and efficiency for the operator. RAPIDFire incorporates the new reference medium calibre 40 mm gun developed by CTAI, the international subsidiary of Nexter Systems and BAE Systems. The system is compatible with the full range of ammunitions developed for land forces programmes and is predisposed to the use of future ammunition as the smart Anti Aerial Airburst (A3B) round.

Nexter and Thales formed a temporary consortium for RAPIDFire as part of a work programme and roadmap put in place 10 years ago. The programme is currently in the development phase. When development is complete, the weapon systems will enter production, and the first delivery is scheduled for 2022. Developed in a surface-to-air approach allowing use at sea but also from land, the project also provides an option to prepare for future use on land carriers. RAPIDFire, a true joint solution, will thus be a gun system capable of equipping naval, land and air forces.

“We’re delighted to be supporting the French Navy as it enhances the self-defence capabilities of its warships. With its combination of fast-into-action time and firing accuracy, RAPIDFire, developed in cooperation with Nexter, provides the best response for protecting Navy vessels against modern threats. It has the potential to become a key component of our offering of advanced force protection solutions.” Thomas Got, Vice-President Integrated Airspace-protection Systems, Thales.

“The 40 CTA has unrivalled power and compactness, making it a gun system that is particularly suitable for protecting surface vessels. With RAPIDFire, Nexter is delighted to extend the CTA40’s range of use in cooperation with Thales and the French Navy.” Michel Vatrey, Systems and Programmes Director, Nexter.

Thales launches the Air Master C Airborne Surveillance Radar - EDR Magazine,"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmV1L3RoYWxlcy1sYXVuY2hlcy10aGUtYWlyLW1hc3Rlci1jLWFpcmJvcm5lLXN1cnZlaWxsYW5jZS1yYWRhctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By Paolo Valpolini

Thales organised a webinar to introduce its new airborne surveillance radar, the Air Master C, where “C” stands for compact. And compact it is, the system dimensions being roughly those of an A3 sheet, the weight being less than 20 kg, while power required is around 1 kW. A considerable SWAP operation, considering that the new radar is an all-in-one solution, the item including the AESA antenna, the RX/TX elements as well as the processing module.

“The current market requires systems that can be easily installed on numerous types of platforms, with high availability and reliability, easy to operate, and capable to provide high quality intelligence,” Jon Bye, Head of Customer Marketing, ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance), stated in his opening remarks. “With this new product we are setting a new standard for surveillance radars,” François Arpagaus, Airborne Surveillance Radars Product Line Director, “as it is a true single unit radar design, which makes it easy to integrate, install, maintain, upgrade and finally to operate.” The Air Master C works in the X band, and in addition to the typical pulse mode it also works in continuous wave mode, which allows to simultaneously carry out detection and tracking, close and far. “It also features 4P polarisation, which includes horizontal, vertical and circular, clockwise and counter clockwise,” Arpagaus adds, explaining that while horizontal polarisation is the one usually adopted on surveillance radars, this is not necessarily the best in some situations, i.e. against small maritime targets, on land and when the system is used in the weather radar mode. “This is an example of ease of use, as polarisation is totally transparent to the operator, the system deciding by itself which type of polarisation is the best suited to the situation.” The whole radar is designed to reduce the operator’s burden, exploiting algorithms and Artificial Intelligence to provide auto detection, automatic target classification and to select automatically the best mode of operation. “The Air Master C will improve its capabilities mission after mission,” Arpagaus notes, “as it has inherent self-learning capabilities.” The 2D AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) antenna exploits the Silicon-Germanium technology, the Air Master C being the first product of its category to adopt it, according to Thales. The antenna covers a 120° sector, Thales being ready to integrate more than one system on a single platform should the customer require a 240° or 360° coverage. “Connections between the single units are made with fiberoptic cables, which reduce weight, simplify integration and are immune to radiofrequency interferences,” the product line director underlines, adding that the radar features HUMS elements allowing predictive maintenance, which further adds to the availability equation, the system being designed for an MTBCF (Mean Time Between Critical Failures) of over 3,000 hours. As most AESA radars, it features an inherent graceful degradation capability. Looking at the future, “it is a software designed radar, therefore introducing new features and capabilities will require only software upgrades, without the need to modify the hardware, thus allowing an easy system evolution” Arpagaus says, mentioning further algorithms improvements and a widespread use of AI, leading towards smart radar concepts, that will be applied transversally to the whole Thales airborne radar portfolio.

Stéphane Lavigne, Head of Sales ISR, announced that the Air Master C has already be selected by the French MoD to be installed on the new Guépard joint helicopter derived from the Airbus H160, that will equip all services replacing five different types of rotary wing aircraft, Gazelle, Alouette III, Dauphin, Panther and Fennec, which prototype should fly within a couple of years. Thales already started to market its new radar, which is being considered by other nations according to Lavigne. “We worked since the design phase hand in hand with our potential customers, thus keeping the users in the loop,” he underlines, adding that the new radar is a breakthrough product with no competitors on the market for the time being. As for its cost, the answer is that “the Air Master C provides much more to the customer in terms of reliability, data processing and performances, at a very competitive price.”

Thales has already overcome some of the development hurdles. In 2019 the Silicon-Germanium antenna was tested and validated, and performed as expected. “We are now finalising the design and moving towards the first prototype, which will be followed by laboratory validation tests, flying tests and qualification,” Arpagaus says, no dates being provided. The timing should however be compatible with that of the Guépard, which development is due to start in 2021. Applications on light aircraft, manned or unmanned, should then follow.

They were novel, if not slightly futuristic, pieces of kit and, much like most technologies, most only saw the positives. However, as time progressed and drones became more sophisticated and accessible, the founders of DroneShield knew that there may be risks associated with this rapid rise in use of commercial drones and other unmanned aerial systems (UAS). In response to this, they created world-leading technology to combat these risks - thus this innovative and multi-award-winning company was born.

Founded in the US in 2014 by two scientists, from Johns Hopkins and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) respectively, DroneShield may have started in the states but is now a wholly Australian owned and run company.

“We transitioned to an Australian owned business when DroneShield was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in 2016 to raise capital to scale the business,” said DroneShield CEO, Oleg Vornik.

‘ASX has a great history in listing, and enabling investment in small fast-growing companies,’ Vornik states.

After the company was listed, DroneShield officially moved its operations to Australia, where the current 40-strong team, with the substantial majority of them engineers, are based.

“All of our engineers, with backgrounds ranging across hardware/FPGA, waveform design, software (front and back end), product and industrial design, are based in Australia and they really are some of the best and brightest minds, working on agile and complex technology solutions.”

It’s this agile and responsive technology development which has led them to adopt the moniker of ‘skunkworks’; one they use with pride (and in pitches).

“We do think of ourselves as skunkworks of complex engineering problems. We’re a relatively small, but high capability experimental business, that’s able to take cutting edge technology and deliver it to products that meet the needs of our customers in a short amount of time,” Vornik says.

In addition to their team, what sets DroneShield apart from other similar organisations are their end to end solutions. Not only does DroneShield detect UASs, they also identify them, track them and ultimately, if required, defeat them.

“The broad scope of our solutions is why I hesitate in calling our business ‘counter drone’ because, while we may have started with that component, we have expanded and grown to so much more than just UAS detection. I think the skunkworks term is probably more accurate, in that we offer capability as opposed to a specific narrow set of solutions. For example, some of our customers are interested in applying our skillsets completely outside of the UAS space, in detection of rogue RF emitters, or using our optical AI for detection and ID or other complex threats” Vornik states.

While the end to end offering is a major differentiator, another is the ability to take individual elements of their capabilities and provide tailor made solutions to their customers. This is a critical service, as while some customers may require detection and identification, they may not require tracking and defeat.

DroneShield’s customer base exists in both the civil market, providing solutions for areas such as large events, airports and power stations and the military environment including the work they’re doing with Thales.

This relationship with Thales started around three years ago when DroneShield began to investigate selling into Defence and Civilian airspace. This coincided with Thales Australia actively looking for innovative Australian SMEs that would be a good fit with Thales’ Group product portfolio, as part of the Australian Governments Global Supply Chain Program.

“When we connected with Thales Australia, they welcomed us with open arms, embraced their GSC program and promoted us tirelessly across their international network,” Vornik said.

While Thales Spain was the first to utilise DroneShield’s technology by integrating their detection and mitigation solutions into its broader suite of defence capabilities, there are multiple opportunities across Thales globally that DroneShield are linking into.

“We work with many outstanding Australian SMEs and DroneShield are a brilliant example of an Australian company providing innovative and competitive solutions that the international markets Thales is working across demands. It’s a pleasure to work with Oleg and the Droneshield team and we are really excited to see this partnership develop and grow for our collective future benefit,” Anne Munro, Thales Australia global supply chain manager, said.

Given the technology behind DroneShield moves at an increasingly fast pace, it’s tough to predict what’s next for the company, however Vornik says the next five years will be focused on strengthening relationships like the one they have with Thales.

“Working with Primes like Thales brings a global network of opportunities, engineers and experience to our work and is an important way to become part of the Defence ecosystem; something we value enormously.”

Are the future French Navy OPVs set to get the new RAPIDFire 40mm naval gun system ? - Naval News,"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYXZhbG5ld3MuY29tL2V2ZW50LW5ld3MvZXVyb25hdmFsLTIwMjAvMjAyMC8xMC9hcmUtdGhlLWZ1dHVyZS1mcmVuY2gtbmF2eS1vcHZzLXNldC10by1nZXQtdGhlLW5ldy1yYXBpZGZpcmUtNDBtbS1uYXZhbC1ndW4tc3lzdGVtL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Are the future French Navy OPVs set to get the new RAPIDFire 40mm naval gun system ? Will the future French Navy Offshore Patrol Vessels get a RAPIDFire 40 mm naval gun ? The French Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly recently lifted veil on the future generation of « Patrouilleurs océaniques » (PO OPV), shedding light on another ship class likely to adopt the new naval gun system by Nexter and Thales.

The OPV replacement program was announced in June 2020 following a Ministerial Committee on Investments. These vessels are « indispensable both overseas and in metropolitan France to carry out the state’s missions at sea. Consequently, we have made filling this gap one of the priorities of the military planning law », Parly said on October 6 to the House of Representatives Defense Committee.

PHM Commandant Birot at Toulon Naval Base in July 2020

The French Navy future OPVs are divided in three sub-components : a first batch of « Patrouilleurs d’Outre-mer » (POM) for Antillas and French Guyana, another six POMs for the other overseas territories (2 in New Caledonia, two in la Réunion and two in French Polynesia), and 10 POs which will replace the Patrouilleurs de haute mer based in Toulon and Brest and the much lighter and unarmed « Patrouilleurs de service public » of Cherbourg. The first two POM OPVs are to be delivered by Socarenam by 2022-end.

About the existing PHM, « I confess the status of these patrol vessel is not brand new and that their availability is lacking, » Parly added, announcing that measures for speeding things up have been taken « to ensure the first two PO units will be delivered before 2025 ». As of now, no contract has been notified and the exact design remains unknown.

PSP Flamant in Concarneau in October 2020

The only certainty is that the POM and PO will be slightly different. « We have made structuring choices since the operational capacities of these new vessels will be much greater than those currently available, » the French Armed Forces minister stressed.

While the POM is a smaller, lightly equipped 1,200-tons vessel, the 10 POs will adopt a 2,000 tons design which will allow them to embark a helicopter and to be fitted with a sonar and larger weapon systems. Answering a question from the delegate Didier Le Gac, in charge of the French Navy 2021 budget, the Defense Minister gave a few more details about some of the PO’s armament, citing for the first time « a 40 mm gun ». Naval News understands this system is likely to be the Thales-Nexter RAPIDFire naval gun system.

The RapidFire has already been selected for the French Navy’s future fleet of replenishment tankers. Nexter and Thales won the tender facing Leonardo with the MARLIN 40mm, Rheinmetall with the Oerlikon Millenium gun 35mm, MBDA with the SIMBAD RC surface to air missile system and BAE Systems Bofors with 40Mk4 40mm. Even if an official confirmation of the RapidFire selection is yet to be made, a notification of the contract reportedly occured in January for developement and delivery of an initial batch.

About RAPIDFire 40mm naval gun system

Florida hopes to offer smartphone-based driver's license by 2021 - Tampa Bay Times,"Sun, 18 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhbXBhYmF5LmNvbS9uZXdzL3RyYW5zcG9ydGF0aW9uLzIwMjAvMTAvMTgvZmxvcmlkYS1ob3Blcy10by1vZmZlci1zbWFydHBob25lLWJhc2VkLWRyaXZlcnMtbGljZW5zZS1ieS0yMDIxL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TAMPA — Want to keep your driver’s license handy without lugging around a purse or wallet?

As soon as next year, there could be an app for that.

Just as house and car keys, bank cards, plane tickets and proof of car insurance have evolved from physical objects to digital apps, a pilot program through the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles will soon determine whether the time has come to store your state-issued driver’s license on your smartphone.

It’s a concept that has gained traction with pilot programs in other states as a way to curb identity theft, card skimmers and even the spread of coronavirus. Louisiana started offering a limited version in 2018, but Florida could be the first in the nation to offer motorists a digital, hands-free driver’s license option for all uses.

The state will launch a pilot program in December.

“As I.D. fraud becomes more frequent and sophisticated, we made it a priority to reinforce ID verification by adding extra software security technologies,"" said Tony Lo Brutto, a vice president at cybersecurity firm Thales, selected to launch driver’s license app and associated verification program.

If all goes well, motorists can choose to apply for both a physical driver’s license and an electronic copy that can be downloaded as an app to a smartphone or tablet. The program has already been approved by the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators, the nation’s umbrella agency for motor vehicle departments, and it meets all personal identification requirements of the International Organization for Standardization, Thales said.

That means the mobile app could be used as identification domestically and overseas.

It will carry the same information as the traditional cards, including driving privileges and restrictions. But with the information now cloud-based, police officers, bartenders and others can more easily determine authenticity. What’s more, users can be selective in how much personal information they turn over.

“Let’s say you’re 21 and have to show I.D. before you walk into a bar,"" said Hillsborough County Tax Collector Doug Belden. “With this technology, you can pull out your phone, select what kind of verification you need and show it to the man at the door without your phone ever leaving your hand.""

Users could limit the information provided to just a photo and if they’re over 21 years old, Belden said, adding that users don’t have to show exact date of birth, where they live, or even their full name. That information can be kept private.

State offices like Belden’s already maintain massive databases of personal information, accessible by authorities, with every driver’s license issued, he said. The wallet-sized cards are simply a pared-down version. But there’s greater security in a digital version, with information kept behind the passcode, pin number or fingerprint-triggered security locks built into most phones and tablets.

If it is lost or stolen, the Thales app enables users to wipe their personal information. In addition, renewals and change of address would be a snap. The no-contact app also means less chance of contacting germs like the coronavirus.

How much it would cost is still being worked out. The price of a standard Class E license in Florida now is $48, first time or renewal. There’s a $35 fee to replace a lost or stolen card. Louisiana charges an additional $5.99 for its app, accepted only for traffic stops inside the state’s borders.

“I’m excited for this innovation project that will make the state of Florida a national leader in offering secure and trusted mobile identification,"" Terry Rhodes, executive director of highway safety and motor vehicles, said in a statement to the Tampa Bay Times.

“We have made a sustained commitment to the modernization of nearly every aspect of what our department does and how customers access our services, and Thales will be a great partner as Florida now steps into the future of mobile identification.”

Thales is also working with 11 other states and five Canadian provinces on mobile driver’s license and personal identification programs, the company said. The company launched the first successful pilot program in 2016 in partnership from the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology."
LeoStella will help build NorthStar's Skylark satellites - GeekWire,"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdlZWt3aXJlLmNvbS8yMDIwL2xlb3N0ZWxsYS10YWtlcy1hc3NlbWJseS1yb2xlLW5vcnRoc3RhcnMtc3BhY2UtdHJhZmZpYy1tb25pdG9yaW5nLXNhdGVsbGl0ZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Tukwila, Wash.-based LeoStella will oversee the assembly of the first three satellites for a constellation that’s designed to keep track of space traffic.

LeoStella’s new project is part of a bigger contract between Canada’s NorthStar Earth and Space on one hand, and Europe’s Thales Alenia Space on the other.

NorthStar says its Skylark satellite constellation will be part of the world’s first commercial space-based environmental and near-space monitoring system. The satellites will be tasked with monitoring thousands of natural and human-made objects in low Earth orbit, and sounding an alert if a collision risk is detected.

That sort of space situational awareness is expected to become more important as thousands more satellites — including spacecraft for the SpaceX Starlink, OneWeb and Amazon Kuiper broadband data networks — are launched in the years ahead.

“We are here to make space safe for doing business, now and into the future,” Stewart Bain, NorthStar’s CEO and co-founder, said in a news release.

The contract for the first three Skylark satellites draws upon complex corporate connections: Thales Alenia Space is one of the world’s largest satellite manufacturers. LeoStella is a joint venture between Thales Alenia Space and BlackSky, a satellite and geospatial intelligence company that has offices in Seattle and Virginia. And as if that’s not complex enough, Thales Alenia Space owns a stake in NorthStar by virtue of its partnership with Telespazio in a joint venture called the Space Alliance.

Thales Alenia Space will be responsible for providing the satellite payloads, while LeoStella will provide its LEO-100 satellite platform and oversee the assembly, integration and testing of the satellites at its Tukwila factory. Financial terms were not disclosed.

NorthStar plans to start operating Skylark in 2022, and will add dual-mission satellites for Earth observation plus space situational awareness in 2024..

LeoStella was created in 2018 to build Earth observation satellites for BlackSky’s constellation. Since then, it’s taken on satellite construction contracts for Cloud Constellation Corp. and Loft Orbital. The venture currently has 45 employees."

Thales launches compact AESA radar | News | Flight Global - Flightglobal,"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vZGVmZW5jZS90aGFsZXMtbGF1bmNoZXMtY29tcGFjdC1hZXNhLXJhZGFyLzE0MDY1MS5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales has unveiled the AirMaster C, a new version of its active electronically scanned array (AESA) airborne surveillance radar that combines a smaller footprint with several advances in technology.

Designed for integration on smaller platforms – the C stands for compact – Thales believes the sensor can bring high levels of performance at a comparable price point to current systems.

“I believe today we have realised some breakthroughs… I would say that this radar has no competitor for the time being,” says Francois Arpagaus, head of the airborne surveillance product line at Thales.

Weighing under 20kg (44lb), the AirMaster C offers 120° of coverage, and can be configured as a single or multi-panel unit, depending on the requirement.

While still under development, the radar has passed through “some major milestones”, says Arpagaus, including validation of its core silicon-germanium antenna technology.

Arpagaus says the design is finalised, with the programme now moving to the “procurement and preparation of prototypes”. Laboratory testing, flight trials and qualification of the system will now follow.

So far the only confirmed application for the AirMaster C is aboard the Airbus Helicopters H160M Guepard being developed for the French armed forces, which is due to enter service in 2026. Although no firm contract is in place, the radar is the subject of “preparatory studies” to ready its integration on the 6t-class rotorcraft.

However, Thales says the radar will be suitable for fixed- or rotary-wing platforms, including unmanned air vehicles, such as the Airbus Helicopters VSR700.

Market research carried out by the manufacturer revealed that operators want a compact radar that offers reliability, ease of use – especially where there is no dedicated operative aboard the aircraft – and which delivers improved intelligence.

Thales says that the significant levels of processing capability and artificial intelligence embedded in the AirMaster C will bring greatly improved operation, allowing customers to “see more, more of the time”. The AESA system will also improve reliability, it claims."
Florida to roll out digital drivers licenses in 2021 - WTXL ABC 27 Tallahassee News,"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd0eGwuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9mbG9yaWRhLXRvLXJvbGwtb3V0LWRpZ2l0YWwtZHJpdmVycy1saWNlbnNlcy1pbi0yMDIx0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (WTXL) — Florida will soon become one of the first states in the United States to provide drivers with ""mobile driver licenses"" that can be seen through an app on smartphones and tablets.

In 2021, Florida residents will be able to start applying for the new mobile licenses that will accessible on a variety of devices, including smartphones and tablets.

That means Florida residents will be able to activate their mobile identification app, select the type of verification needed, and hold up their mobile device.

“I’m excited for this innovation project that will make the state of Florida a national leader in offering secure and trusted mobile identification, which is a priority for our Governor, Ron DeSantis,” said Terry L. Rhodes, Executive Director of the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. “We have made a sustained commitment to the modernization of nearly every aspect of what our department does and how customers access our services, and Thales will be a great partner as Florida now steps into the future of mobile identification.”

Thales, the company behind the technology, said that users of mobile driver licenses will also be able control what information is displayed from the app depending on the context.

“As ID fraud becomes more frequent and sophisticated, we made it a priority to reinforce ID verification by adding extra software security technologies. In the future, enterprises such as airports, hotels, car rental companies etc, in Florida will be able to rely on Thales to identify customers, while guaranteeing their privacy”, said Tony Lo Brutto, VP NORAM, Identity and Biometric Solutions at Thales.

They also said the mobile licenses are harder to counterfeit because they host a secure digitized credential whose authenticity can be checked rather than simply displaying a digital image of a driver license that could be easily manipulated.

Thales said the mobile driver licenses ""meet the national and international standards from the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators and the International Organization for Standardization, meaning they can be used across the United States and internationally."""

French companies Nexter and Thales formed a temporary consortium for RAPIDFire 40mm automatic cannon as part of a work program and roadmap put in place 10 years ago. The program is currently in the development phase. When development is complete, the weapon systems will enter production, and the first delivery is scheduled for 2022.

The RapidFire 40mm cannon was developed in a surface-to-air approach allowing use at sea but also from land, the project also provides an option to prepare for future use on land carriers. RAPIDFire, a true joint solution, will thus be a gun system capable of equipping naval, land and air forces.

Naval forces are exposed to several threats with complex behaviours, such as unmanned air and surface vehicles, light aircraft and missiles. RAPIDFire leverages the combined expertise of Thales and Nexter to meet the very short-range defence requirements of the armed forces. The solution features a latest-generation multi-threat (air and surface), multi-environment (land and naval) gun system, with a cost of engagement commensurate with the value of the threats.

RAPIDFire is a gun system that offers high precision thanks to its optronic fire control system integrated onto the turret, its advanced algorithms, powerful gun and automatic ammunition management system allowing the best reactivity and efficiency for the operator. RAPIDFire incorporates the new reference medium calibre 40 mm gun developed by CTAI, the international subsidiary of Nexter Systems and BAE Systems. The system is compatible with the full range of ammunitions developed for land forces programs and is predisposed to the use of future ammunition as the smart Anti Aerial Airburst (A3B) round."
Netpoleon lands Thales distie deal - Security - CRN Australia,"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNybi5jb20uYXUvbmV3cy9uZXRwb2xlb24tbGFuZHMtdGhhbGVzLWRpc3RpZS1kZWFsLTU1NDY0NdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French cybersecurity vendor Thales has named Netpoleon as its new distribution partner for Australian and New Zealand.

The deal will see Netpoleon offer the vendor’s cloud protection and licensing solutions including: access management, encryption, key management and data discovery and classification.

The company rolled out a new channel push earlier this year with a big focus on the US market and is now continuing that drive locally.

Brian Grant, newly appointed regional director of data protection solutions at Thales, said:

The Accelerate partner program was designed to expand the vendor’s position as a “global leader in data security.”

“Given the growth of our partner community in Australia and New Zealand, we sought to provide a wider choice in distributors. Thales has worked with Netpoleon in other Asia-Pacific locations, so combined with their experienced local cyber security team, it was a great fit.

“Netpoleon is a nimble yet experienced distributor that shares our vision for empowering and enabling the partner community, with a focus on delivering the best cyber security solutions.”

Singapore headquartered Netpoleon has been in the local market for almost one year, landing in December 2019 and bringing network security offerings from Radware and Vectra AI.

At the time, the company appointed the former leader of M.Tech Distribution, Paul Lim to run its local operation.

“Thales delivers a vital security solution for channel partners helping customers to embark on a digital transformation journey securely in these challenging times,” Lim said in a statement.

“An augmented portfolio in Thales and our past working experience with Brian and his team, will allow our combined organisations to deliver new cutting edge encryption and secure cloud solutions to the ANZ market.”

In February, the French Vendor was awarded the contract to lead the development of Queensland’s digital driver's licence.

Grant described the relationship as a ‘great fit’ citing the cyber security focus and technical expertise of Netpoleon.

“We can assist with the education and enablement of a wide range of new partners, which will be applying a more effective means of embedding data protection in business processes, instead of the cumbersome and costly infrastructure-centric approach used historically.”

“With the emergence of so many multi-party threats and successful attacks across industry and government, it is critically important that we help our partners and customers evolve to reach a point where data protection is no longer a static part of IT infrastructure, but is embedded in the fabric of digital transformation and business processes.”"
Global availability for A2G solution - Inflight,"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZmxpZ2h0LW9ubGluZS5jb20vZ2xvYmFsLWF2YWlsYWJpbGl0eS1mb3ItYTJnLXNvbHV0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales in the UK, Nokia and SkyFive have internationally launched a new 4G LTE Air to Ground (A2G) solution, following its implementation across Europe.

The technology is being rolled out in regions around the world where domestic and international carriers will be able to use the 4G masts on land. It has been developed through a collaborative partnership with Thales providing the onboard terminal (modem+RF) and antenna; Nokia responsible for on-ground infrastructure and SkyFive’s patented software algorithms ensuring that aircraft can reliably connect at high speeds, high altitudes and across long ranges.

The 4G LTE solution offers connectivity with speeds up to 100Mbps and latency of less than 50ms. Utilising existing 4G technology, A2G connects aircrafts with the nearest purpose-built on-ground towers, which are densely grouped to prevent aircrafts sharing bandwidth, handing over between masts mid-flight to create consistently fast 4G connectivity throughout journeys. The network’s design also means A2G has greater capacity per km2 than current satellites.

According to the three partners, aboard A2G enabled aircraft, the experience for passengers will be comparable to using a 4G mobile phone service on the ground, with passengers able to make uninterrupted video-conferencing calls, watch live TV or stream the latest series in HD from their own handset.

The compact nature of the 4G antenna reduces CO2 emissions and cuts installation times down to just 12 hours.

The parties claim that once installed, new 4G enabled in-flight capabilities will create an aircraft environment for an Internet of Things in which operational efficiencies such as engine offload data can be viewed in real time, customer experience can be measured and targeted advertising can be introduced. Better connectivity can also support the facilitation of new COVID-19 safety protocols as they are implemented."

Strong competition for talent and skills shortages in key areas including digital, project management and engineering continue to define the defence landscape and point to the need to invest in people.

What are the required skills in defence?

============== ==============

According to data published by Kinexus in November 2019, project management heads the list of required “hard” skills, with it comprising 20 per cent of all defence job ads. Other project-related skills also sit within the top 10 such as scheduling and budgeting.

Technical and engineering competencies featured in the high-demand skills list include systems engineering, software engineering, other engineering activities, configuration management, technical support, workforce planning and software development.

1

“Soft” skills are just as important and now more than ever as jobs become more complex with the realities of COVID-19 impacting everything from where we work, to what we do and how we do it. According to Kinexus, the top 10 soft skills are leadership, teamwork, communication skills, problem-solving, work ethic, flexibility/adaptability and interpersonal skills.

These skills translate into specific job requirements such as project management, process improvement, change management, performance management, contract management and more.

A report by KPMG in 2018 found that organisations that invested in project management capability successfully delivered 92 per cent of their projects, compared with a mere 32 per cent project success rate from organisations who do not. They also spent 21-times less money, completed 28 per cent more projects on-time and on-budget and had 9 per cent fewer failures.

How do organisations that are experiencing disruption continue to lead?

The 23rd Annual Global CEO Survey (2020) by PWC calls for a strategic response to disruption, noting “digital technology is reshaping the nature of combat and the nature of business, and defence companies need to transform nearly every aspect of how they operate in order to compete”.

Aparajita Paul, the learning lead from Thales Australia, advocates the importance of maintaining people development programs during uncertain times to bolster long-term capability as well as staff sentiment in the short term.

She explains, “We were in an excellent position to maintain people development during COVID-19 because there’s strong alignment between our learning programs and business strategy. We worked tirelessly to convert face to face programs to virtual formats with strong consideration for access, inclusion, and flexibility in the current climate. Preserving learning opportunities played a valuable role in re-assuring staff who were adjusting to major changes such as being redeployed to remote work at short-notice.”

Employee Wellbeing in COVID-19

Looking after employee wellbeing has become a hot topic in these unprecedented times but are organisations doing a good job at this? Shockingly, the ‘COVID-19 Employee Wellbeing Study’ (2020) by Gallagher reported that 51 per cent of Australia’s 12 million workers received no support from their employer during the first wave of COVID-19 despite the unprecedented challenges facing society.

What makes a learning program strategic and effective?

A quick test of the strategic strength of any learning program should consider four things: alignment to core organisational competencies; articulation of learning pathways beyond the course; customisation to context; and lastly performance and people results. In uncertain or disrupted times, we also need to validate that the core competencies remain current.

Let’s take the Thales Australia BSB51415 Diploma of Project Management as an example. The program was implemented in 2019 to enable enhanced performance, advancement and global transfer of its project managers.

Its maps to the inhouse competency framework and provides clear learning pathways to International Project Management Association (IPMA) certification levels A, B and C as per their Individual Competence Baseline (ICB4). The Diploma program is also endorsed by the Australian Institute of Project Management (AIPM), facilitating local certification under the AIPM’s RegPM program, in addition to international certification.

This nationally recognised program was extensively customised by training provider Elemental Projects to reflect the unique aspects of project management within Thales Australia and the Australian defence industry. This included:

embedding Thales Australia’s internal project management methodology and templates into learning resources and assessment tasks;

incorporating guest internal lecturers;

leveraging a bespoke case study to reflect a multi-faceted defence project; and

advancing the organisation’s “left shift” transformation by aligning the bid and project delivery stages through cost estimating and planning practices.

The structure and content of the Diploma program reflected the top-ranked hard and soft skills identified in Kinexus’ research above, ensuring a focus on priority capabilities for the future.

The inclusive and blended course design incorporates team activities, gamification and on-demand access to bite-sized video content that maximise practical application, engagement and reinforces learnings. The course culminates in a project simulation that tests the learner’s knowledge and skills in an interactive dynamic environment.

In short, the course aligns with core competencies, has clear learning pathways and is highly customised to context.

Pivoting to online delivery

The recent conversion of the program to virtual format due to COVID-19 restrictions is an example of an agile response to changing industry conditions to retain currency. Six days of face-to-face training were replaced with 10 x four-hour live online sessions featuring virtual breakout rooms for teamwork.

These sessions were delivered over nine months and interspersed with individual assessment work and engagement with line managers and colleagues. Recordings of course sessions were edited and shared and have become an additional valuable learning tool.

This digital format also aligns with Thales’ strategic goals and enhances accessibility and inclusion for it’s 3,900 employees either working from home or spread across 37 sites in Australia.

As is often the case with innovation, unexpected results emerge. In this case, the virtual format proved highly effective for Thales Australia’s dispersed workforce with demand for the virtual program doubling compared with the face-to-face format.

People and performance results

But as always, the proof is in the pudding. A true test of learning interventions is always whether they deliver excellent people and performance results. Primary indicators of course success are completion and pass rates.

These are both sitting at 100 per cent for completed courses, meaning all students met the rigorous assessment standards and achieved a nationally recognised BSB51415 Diploma of Project Management qualification.

By contrast, industry norms record an average 77 per cent pass rate and 58.9 per cent completion rate for diploma level qualifications, according to the latest VET data compiled by the National Centre for Vocational Education Research in 2017.

A post-completion survey demonstrated extremely positive results and high student satisfaction. For example, 100 per cent of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the course developed expected skills; prepared them for work; was flexible; and that they would recommend the program to others.

A Benefits Realisation survey revealed even more remarkable results: 71 per cent of graduates are now working in manager roles and 14 per cent received a formal promotion as a result of the capabilities they developed during the course.

In addition to supporting career advancement and succession planning in line with Thales’ global talent strategy, 85 per cent of graduates reported feeling more confident and 71 per cent reflected that they had developed their internal network as a result of the course. These benefits together enhance individual job satisfaction, project performance and organisational culture.

Qualitative feedback from key business stakeholders’ points to further benefits for the business. Steven Hatch, Thales Australia’s business support manager (maritime), said that graduates had “moved into performing pivotal roles within critical projects and are contributing to their projects ongoing success”.

Deepak Prasad, director of bids and projects (maritime), added, “The robust foundation provided by the Diploma has armed the graduates with skills, confidence and a desire to learn more which will serve them and the business well.”

While Richard Banks, project management office manager (air mobility) noted that “course graduates have developed a greater understanding of the way Thales implements project management”, which is a testament to the value of course customisation.

In a world that has become more volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA), there is a significant need to focus more than ever on developing people so they’re armed with the knowledge, skills, networks and mindset to successfully deliver their projects and programs.

It’s clear that people need strong project management and leadership skills, continuously developed with the support of management and colleagues, as they transform their delivery approach to be more collaborative, innovative and adaptable. This is what is required for success in VUCA environments. This is the new normal.

Let’s heed the call to support employees and maintain their professional development despite the challenges of these uncertain times. The outcomes are worth it when we align our learning programs with organisational strategy and invest in our most valued assets: people.

This testing uses a Next Generation Thales SBAS technology developed especially for customers close to the equator with difficult ionospheric conditions, like Australia and New Zealand.

SBAS and PPP (Precise Point Positioning) will deliver a greatly enhanced positioning service for Australia and New Zealand under the Southern Positioning Augmentation Network being undertaken jointly by the governments of Australia and New Zealand.

In order to test and validate key subsystems for the delivery of early services to Australia and New Zealand should Thales be selected to supply the Southern Positioning Augmentation Network, the transmission received in WA was generated by Thales Alenia Space using the NIGCOMSAT-1R satellite, currently involved in testing of a Next Generation SBAS solution.

Thales Australia Director Space Matt Dawson said that Thales’s strong global team and integrated industrial network extends across multiple continents and demonstrates its ability to deliver system outcomes despite the challenges of COVID-19. “Thales has been supported in its work by specialist expertise from GPSat Systems based in Melbourne, and by Hexagon|NovAtel, a world leading GNSS receiver manufacturer. “NovAtel engineers that have also been monitoring this new broadcast, reported sufficient data to track PRN 147 signals and use them for SBAS corrections.”

Thales Alenia Space Vice President Navigation Benoit Broudy said that Australia is integral to the global development of Thales’s SBAS and PPP solutions and will benefit from major advances in the technology. “The current broadcast comes via the NIGCOMSAT-1R satellite, that is positioned to serve Africa, so Western Australia is on the very edge of its coverage area. We are offering two new satellite payloads aboard Optus satellites to provide services across Australia and New Zealand, which could be extended into the Pacific Island regions.”

Optus head of Satellite and Space Systems, Nick Leake, said: “Receiving this signal through Optus’ Lockridge Earth Station, using Thales’s SBAS technology, is a major milestone and demonstrates what is possible from a world leading SBAS provider. With multiple gateways across Australia and the most experienced satellite fleet and workforce in the region, Optus continues to lead in satellite and space in Australia.”"

The Royal Navy's Future Frigates - An Analysis - UK Defence Journal,"Thu, 01 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vdWtkZWZlbmNlam91cm5hbC5vcmcudWsvdGhlLXJveWFsLW5hdnlzLWZ1dHVyZS1mcmlnYXRlcy1hbi1hbmFseXNpcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Laid down in December 1982, HMS CORNWALL the first of the Type 22 Batch 3 frigates class of four ships demonstrated that lessons had been learnt from the Falklands conflict earlier in the same year.

This article was submitted to the UK Defence Journal by Kelvin Curnow. Kelvin’s particular area of interest is naval aircraft and aircraft carriers. He is a keen writer and over the past fifteen years he has had a number of articles published in different journals.

The weapons fit were dramatically revised in comparison to the previous two Batches. They were completed with a 4.5 inch (114mm) Mk.8 gun for Naval Gunfire Support (NGS) which proved essential in the Falklands but was missing from the Batch 1 and 2 ships.

The first generation Aérospatiale (now MBDA) Exocet anti-ship missiles (AShMs) found on the earlier ships were replaced by eight McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing) Harpoon AShMs. Demonstrating that the weapons fitted to the ships in the Falklands Task Force had failed to counter the Exocet threat with disastrous consequences, a Hollandse Signaal (now Thales) 30mm Goalkeeper close-in weapons system (CIWS) was included in the design. The follow-on design, the Type 23 Duke class, the first of which was laid down in December 1985, reflected many of the features of the Batch 3s, but with notable differences.

The BAeD (now MBDA) GWS-25 Sea Wolf surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) previously carried in two six round launchers were replaced by GWS-26 Vertical Launch Sea Wolf (VLSW) contained in 32 cells. This addressed problems which had been encountered in the Falklands with the box launchers where failures in the mechanical hardware causing firing failures. The necessity to reload after twelve firings was also addressed by switching to vertical launching systems (VLSs).

The VLSW has now been replaced by the far more capable MBDA Sea Ceptor missile. For the first time on a RN ship the Type 23 introduced substantial radar cross-section reduction measures. Not so positive was the deletion of a dedicated CIWS as a cost cutting measure. The design features found on the Type 23s, which like the later Type 22s stemmed from lessons taken from the Falklands conflict, would set the pattern for current warships designed for the RN.

THE TYPE 26 FRIGATE

Commenced in 1998, under what was then known as the Future Surface Combatant (FSC) programme, by March 2010 this had developed to become the Global Combat Ship programme following the announcement of a four-year £127M design contract being awarded to BAE Systems. The Type 26 City class will feature some considerable improvements over the Type 23. Weighing 5,400 tons (8,000 tons at full load) the Type 26 is twice the tonnage of its predecessor and follows a pattern set by the RN of building ships of at least double the size and weight of those they succeed.

Originally planned to replace the Type 23 on a one-for-one basis, the 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review (2015 SDSR) stated that only eight of the frigates would be built, not the originally planned thirteen. This decision was taken to reduce costs, as was the decision to delay the start of construction from late 2016 until 20 June 2017 when the build of HMS GLASGOW the first of three Batch 1 ships of the class commenced. Of the other two Batch 1 vessels HMS CARDIFF was laid down on 14 of August 2019 with construction of HMS BELFAST yet to commence. HMS EDINBURGH, HMS BIRMINGHAM, HMS SHEFFIELD, HMS NEWCASTLE and HMS LONDON will form Batch 2.

The total cost of the programme will amount to some £8B+.

Despite it being designed to replace the increasingly obsolescent Type 23, many of the weapons and systems on the Type 26 will have already been proven on the earlier vessel, notably the BAES Type997 Artisan (Advanced Radar Target Indication Situational Awareness and Navigation) 3D radar and the Sea Ceptor SAM. Also carried over are the Thales 2087 low frequency variable depth towed array sonar and the Ultra Electronics 2150 bow sonar. Each ship’s single Rolls Royce MT30 Gas Turbine is the same as that fitted to the Queen Elizabeth class carriers.

The BAES Outfit DNA(2)/CMS-1 Combat Management System (CMS) will also be a carry-over from both the Types 23 and 45. Likewise its helicopter, either the Leonardo Merlin HM2 or the Leonardo Wildcat HMA2 along with their attendant weapons will already have been in RN service for some time before HMS GLASGOW is commissioned in 2027. Whereas the equipment of the Type 45 was 80 per cent new, in the Type 26 only 20 per cent will be new.

This ensures that despite the £1B price tag per frigate costs are kept down by using proven technologies and equipment, and expenditure can be concentrated on aspects of the design to ensure that it is a generation ahead of offerings from other ship builders.

The claim by BAES that the Type 26 is the world’s most advanced anti-submarine frigate is largely based on noise reduction which is achieved by a mixture of engineering solutions building on knowledge gained via the Type 23 programme. These include hull shaping, internal pipework design and fixing equipment on shock and vibration-resistant mountings. Noise reduction has been achieved by mounting the MT90 gas turbine in an acoustic enclosure designed to minimise vibration and radiated noise. The Type 26 is powered by a Combined Diesel-Electric OR Gas Turbine (CODELOG) arrangement with four MTU 20-Cylinder 4000 M53B engines providing the diesel generator power. These are also contained in acoustic enclosures which are on mounts designed to isolate them from the frigate’s hull structure. Noise reduction is further aided by the aft two diesel generators being mounted above the waterline.

The vessels will carry the BAES 5 inch 127 mm L54 Mark 19 gun and will be fitted with a 24 cell strike-length Lockheed Martin Mk 41 VLSs which are sited forward of the bridge. The VLSs will make possible the carriage of the Raytheon Tomahawk Land Attack cruise Missile (TLAM), the Lockheed Martin RUM-139C Anti-Submarine ROCket (ASROC) and the Lockheed Martin AGM-158C Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM). Other possible weapons will include the MBDA SCALP (Système de Croisière Autonome à Longue Portée – Long Range Standoff Cruise Missile) Naval (or MdCN Missile de Croisière Naval – naval cruise missile), or the Anglo-French MBDA CVS401 Perseus cruise missile currently under development. However, none of these weapons are currently in RN service and at this point there is no commitment to purchase any new munitions.

It may well be that the Type 26 enters service with the 5 inch gun, two Phalanx CIWS, twenty four Sea Ceptor missiles and the Thales Martlet, MBDA Sea Venom AShMs together with BAES Stingray torpedos carried by the on-board helicopters. With its primary role designated as an anti-submarine frigate it appears extraordinary that any attack on a submarine will be reliant on getting the ship’s helicopter aloft, something which cannot occur in extreme weather conditions. It is not fitted with the Magazine Launched Torpedo System (MLTS) carried on the Type 23s which would allow the frigate to fire Stingray anti-submarine torpedoes from an internal magazine.

By way of comparison the Franco-Italian FREMM (Frégate européenne multi-mission – European multi-purpose frigate) are equipped with B-515 launchers for the EuroTorp MU-90 torpedo while the Italian frigates are also equipped with the MBDA MILAS anti-submarine rocket system. The frigate also carries the NH90 anti-submarine helicopter which is also armed with the MU-90. Ironically in the 1970s and 80s RN ships were equipped with the Australian GAF Ikara ASW missile, generally accepted to be a superior weapons system to the ASROC.

While the Type 26 is primarily an anti-submarine frigate procuring single role vessels for the RN which is ever decreasing in size must be examined. In this respect the effectiveness of the vessel in the air defence role must be questioned. This may be compromised by the Artisan radar/Sea Ceptor missile combination. It is claimed by BAES that Artisan radar has a high level of resistance to jamming. Like the BAES SAMPSON radar it provides air surveillance, target identification and air traffic management services. Unlike the Type 45s which have a BAES S1850M dedicated air search radar, the Type 26 frigates must rely on Artisan for all surveillance and targeting functions.

The RN believes that this issue is offset by the Sea Ceptor missile system which requires no dedicated tracker/illuminator radars. The Mach 3 Sea Ceptor missile is cued by the ship’s target indication data and incorporates a datalink for mid-course guidance updates before it uses its own active seeker to guide it to its target. Artisan, like the SAMPSON radar, sits atop a tall mast giving it a good radar horizon and this feature is enhanced by the Sea Ceptor which does not require line-of-sight in order to engage its target. However, unlike SAMPSON which features two back-to-back planar arrays which rotate at 30 revolutions per minute (RPM) leaving no area of the sky without coverage for less than 0.5 seconds, Artisan rotates at 30 RPM which means that with its single array the radar picture is updated every two seconds.

Once detected the target’s position can be updated frequently on which basis it can create a tactical picture. Conversely, the effective radar range is limited because Artisan cannot stare in any one direction for very long it cannot put so much energy onto a target. The effectiveness of using a single mechanically scanned radar can also be compromised by how violently an incoming AShM manoeuvres. A lack of targeting information would also mean that Sea Ceptor must then rely on its own seeker which may then put the AShM dangerously close to the frigate.

In addition to the Sea Ceptor the other legacy weapon which will equip the Type 26 is the ubiquitous Phalanx CIWS. The continuing viability of the Phalanx to provide a ‘last ditch’ defence against incoming AShMs must be questioned considering its inauspicious combat record. Given its past failures in the face of relatively unsophisticated first and second generation AShMs the probability of it being effective against the latest generation of missiles is very low. To compensate for its growing obsolescence the US Navy has been augmenting the Phalanx by equipping its ships with the Raytheon RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM). Future US developments for short-range defence will possibly rely on the AN/SEQ-3 Laser Weapon System.

The UK equivalent is the MBDA Dragonfire laser directed energy weapon currently being developed by the Defence, Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl). At this point laser weapons have proven to be capable of shooting down drones, though whether or not enough power can be generated by a ship for the laser to be capable of shooting down supersonic or hypersonic AShMs remains to be seen. The performance of lasers is also downgraded by bad weather and smoke, so at best such weapons would be complementary to gun/missile defences. All of this remains very much in the future, for the present however, the Phalanx as a weapons choice for the Type 26 signals no progression in ‘last ditch’ defence.

The June 2018 decision by Australia to purchase nine Type 26 frigates as the Hunter class could see the RN purchasing the same radar fit to be mounted on the Australian vessels, the CEAFAR 2 Active Phased Array Radar and CEAMOUNT Active Phased Array Illuminator. The CEAFAR/CEAMOUNT radar combination radically changes the size and design of the main mast with six diamond shaped arrays for each radar mounted on the mast. The radar will be integrated with the Lockheed Martin designed Aegis combat management system and Saab Australia 9LV tactical interface. CEAFAR employs a unique microwave tile-based design. The combination of the microwave tile and the Digital Beam Forming (DBF) backend provides the CEAFAR radar with the capability to perform simultaneous 360 degree 3D volume air search, surface search, fire control support and target classification in cluttered and jamming environments.

The CEAMOUNT radar provides target illumination and missile uplink simultaneously for multiple semi-active radar homing missiles and would probably not be purchased by RN with both the Aster and Sea Ceptor being active radar homing missiles. The CEAFAR/CEAMOUNT combination requires considerably more power than the Artisan, is heavier and takes up more space. Claims were made in the Australian press that the Type 26 would require a substantial redesign and the vessels would grow to 10,000 tonnes. These claims were subsequently denied by BAE Australia which suggest that the claim the original design had growth potential built in would appear correct. The total cost of the Australian programme is AUD$35B which reflects the far more sophisticated fit out of the Hunter class giving it a capability to provide area air defence and operate in conjunction with the RAN’s Hobart class destroyers via Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC).

An alternative to the Australian radar could be to mount both the SAMPSON and S1850M radars on the Type 26 hull as proposed for the Type 4X destroyer. This would give the Type 26 area air defence capabilities equivalent to those of the Type 45s and make them more of a multi-role frigate rather than a single role ship. As with the Hunter class concerns have been raised with respect to the Type 26’s ability to be fitted with a large mast capable of mounting a SAMPSON radar with the commensurate increase in weight. These have been addressed in UK Defence Journal interview with Paul Sweeney, former MP for Glasgow North East and former shipbuilder. The possibility of building the Type 26s in different configurations delivers the possibility not only of an ongoing ‘drumbeat’ of construction but also economies of scale.

THE TYPE 31 FRIGATE

Announced as part of the 2015 SDSR, the Type 31 will comprise a class of five vessels, described as light frigates, replacing the cancelled Type 26 frigates. A contract for the ships was formally awarded to Babcock Group on 15 November 2019 for their Arrowhead 140 design. Based on the Danish Iver Huitfeldt class the Type 31 weighs 5,700 tonnes making them heavier than the Type 23, hence it is misleading to describe them as ‘light frigates’. Compared to the BAES 3,677 ton Leander design submitted in competition with the Arrowhead 140, the Babcock ship ensures greater growth potential for adding weapons and sensors in the future. Costing an average of £250M per vessel there is the possibility that more will be built and the RN’s surface fleet expanded.

To keep the costs down it had been conjectured that the Type 31 would employ weapons and sensors transferred across from the Type 23s as each was decommissioned. It came as somewhat of a surprise when it was announced that the ships would be armed with one Bofors 57mm Mk110 and two Bofors 40mm Mk4 guns and use the Thales TACTICOS Baseline 2 combat management system (CMS) and the Thales NS110 AESA radar. These are found on no other RN ship. The Type 31s will also have a 24 cell VLS for Sea Ceptor missiles (although the latest illustrations show only 12 cells) and carry either a Wildcat or Merlin helicopter. The RN’s earlier experience with light frigates, the Type 21 Amazon class, were ill-equipped particularly with respect to anti-air weapons and consequently suffered two sinkings in the Falklands War.

The Type 31 in comparison will carry cutting edge weapons and sensors and prove far more survivable in a shooting war, especially when operating in concert with Type 45s and Type 26 where each type will provide complementary capabilities. Operating alone, they would prove useful in patrolling the Gulf, the Strait of Hormuz and on anti-piracy duties off Somalia. Moreover, the increasing deficit in RN personnel would be offset by building ships of this type which require smaller crews. The Type 23s require a crew of 185, the Type 31 in comparison will require 80-100 officers and ratings.

With the Type 31 contract being awarded to Babcock the UK will have two frigate designs in production simultaneously. Moreover, each design will be armed with different weapons and equipped with different radar systems which will be complementary to each other. The move away from a BAES monopoly on warship construction will ensure that going forward the RN will have access to a wider range of weapons and systems. A primary example of this is the decision to equip the Type 31s with the Thales NS110 AESA 4D E/F band dual axis two panel radar. The radar scans at a rate of 30rpm and simultaneously scans in azimuth and range. It has a maximum air search range of 152nm (280km) and can simultaneously track 1,000 targets.

An Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) interrogator antenna is integrated with the main radar as part of the multi-purpose platform. Also integrated are the: X-band Scout Mk3 frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar for low probability of intercept (LPI) and high resolution surface search; an IR-camera; the automatic identification system (AIS) for commercial ship tracking; and, Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) civil aircraft tracking antennas. Not as sophisticated as a radar with four flat panel arrays the NS110 is nevertheless scalable with the addition of transmit/receive (T/R) modules and as an AESA radar uses superior technology to the Artisan.

Without a medium-calibre gun the Type 31 will be incapable of providing NGS. Nevertheless, for its intended roles in low-medium intensity conflicts the frigate is very well equipped to provide air defence against aircraft, UAVs and AShMs and against surface threats posed by fast attack craft. The 40mm gun is arguably superior to the Phalanx as a CIWS by delivering a heavier weight of fire further away from the ship. The gun has a rate of fire of 300 rounds per minute (rpm) and has a maximum range of 7.8 miles (12.5km). The 57mm gun can fire up to 220 rounds per minute out to a range of 10.6 miles (17km). Both guns can fire the BAE FUZE Pre-fragmented, Programmable and Proximity-fused (3P) ammunition and can quickly switch to engage a range of air and surface targets.

The Mk110 can fire BAES Ordnance for Rapid Kill of Attack Craft (ORKA) projectile which is a one shot-one kill round fitted with an imaging semi-active seeker. It can be guided to its target through laser designation or autonomously by downloading an image of the target prior to firing.

In development is the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA’s) Multi-Azimuth Defense Fast Intercept Round Engagement System (MAD-FIRES) point defence anti-missile missile which will be fired from the gun. When factors such as the rate of fire and the amount of explosive per shell into account the Bofors gun actually achieves a higher amount of explosive fired per second compared to the Leonardo 76mm gun.

The primary air defence weapon, the Sea Ceptor, combined with the two gun systems provides good protection against saturation attacks from the widest range of air threats short of hypersonic missiles.

Propulsion will be provided by four MTU 20V 8000 M71 engines, each delivering over 8,000 kW in a Combined Diesel And Diesel (CODAD) arrangement. This is the same layout found in the Iver Huitfeldt class which does not make either type particularly well suited to an anti-submarine (ASW) role although care has been taken to reduce the acoustic signature. Nevertheless there is provision for mounting a sonar on the hull, and the Danish vessels do feature the Atlas ASO 94 hull mounted sonar.

The Iver Huitfeldt class also mount four launchers for MU-90 ASW torpedoes, a feature also lacking on the Type 31. This reflects the reality that the Danish vessels are designed to perform a wider variety of roles than the Type 31 as demonstrated by their ability to carry thirty-two Raytheon SM-2 IIIA SAMs in Mk 41 VLSs, twenty-four RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles (ESSMs) in Mk 56 VLSs, and eight to sixteen Boeing Harpoon Block II AShMs.

This indicates the possibility for growth in the future for the Type 31 thanks to the modular design of the ship permitting an increase in top weight, something which has inhibited adding weapons to previous RN ships. (Witness the inability to add Phalanx CIWS to the Type 42s without removing the ship’s boats.) The Type 31 has a large flight deck and hangar, plus flexible mission bays amidships offering future growth potential.

What is not clear at this point is if the Type 31s are going to use some form of the StanFlex modular mission payload system as found on the Danish vessels. Such a system would greatly enhance the flexibility of the design and permit the addition of additional weapons with greater straightforwardness.

FUTURE POSSIBILITIES

Like the Type 26 the Type 31 will go to sea with a minimal weapons fit particularly with respect to ship-launched ASW weapons, long-range SAMs, land-attack cruise missiles (LACMs) and AShMs despite both vessels having the ability to be so equipped. Both designs feature mission bays which provide the possibility that the frigates will carry unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). The RN has already carried out successful trials with the Elbit Systems UK Seagull USV.

The Seagull has multi-mission capability, being able to perform ASW, Mine Counter Measures (MCM), Electronic Warfare (EW), Maritime Security (MS), Hydrography and other missions. Two vessels can be controlled from the same MCS (Mission Control System) and the Seagull is capable of both manned and unmanned modes of operation. Employing USVs for a wide range of missions will provide a force multiplier for the host vessel. The problem remains that neither the Type 26 nor 31 will carry on-board ASW weapons.

Prospectively to be announced in the upcoming 2021 Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy is a decision on the Interim Surface to Surface Guided Weapon (I-SSGW) requirement which will be purchased to arm the eight towed-array sonar equipped Type 23s. The possibilities to fulfil this requirement are the Lockheed Martin Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), the Kongsberg Naval Strike Missile (NSM) and the Saab RBS15 Mk 4 ‘Gungnir’ (Odin’s Spear). These will undoubtedly transferred to the Type 26s as each Type 23 leaves service.

With no prospect of additional AShMs being available, the Type 31s will rely on Wildcat helicopters armed with Martlet and Sea Venom missiles to provide an anti-ship capability. Here the same problem exists as with ASW weapons; if the helicopter is not airborne the frigate effectively possesses no ant-ship capabilities. In the Gulf where the greatest surface danger comes from Iranian fast attack craft a combination of the Type 31’s 57mm and 40mm guns and the missile equipped Wildcats are particularly well suited to counter such a threat. However, initially there are no plans to equip the frigates with heavier AShMs, undoubtedly because of cost.

A possible answer to this dilemma could come by retaining the Harpoon Block 1C missiles currently arming the Type 23s and due to be retired from service in 2023. Rather than retiring their stocks of the Block 1C the USN is modifying and upgrading the missiles to Block II+ which features an improved GPS guidance kit and a networked enabled data link that enables the missile to receive in-flight targeting updates. At a cost of USD$240,000 (£185,000) per round this is a very cost-effective solution for providing long range anti-shipping strike and land attack. This solution makes further sense if the Boeing Poseidon MRA1 aircraft are armed with the air-launched version of the Harpoon.

CONCLUSION

The Royal Navy has wisely chosen two designs which are considerably larger than any frigates which have preceded them. There is ample space in both designs for future growth should decisions be made to either update or add additional weapons and sensors.

Indeed this will prove necessary throughout the life of the ships as the type and lethality of threats grow. Unfortunately, as demonstrated with the Type 45 where Mk 41 VLSs have not been fitted to the ships, despite space specifically in place for them, under-investment in both the Type 26 and Type 31 will see their potential limited.

At a time when there is an increasing threat from a resurgent Russian Navy to not see the ships developed to their full potential would be negligent.

Florida drivers can soon ditch their physical Driver's License for a digital version on their mobile devices - Florida Insider,"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFodHRwczovL2Zsb3JpZGFpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS90cmF2ZWwvZmxvcmlkYS1kcml2ZXJzLWNhbi1zb29uLWRpdGNoLXRoZWlyLXBoeXNpY2FsLWRyaXZlcnMtbGljZW5zZS1mb3ItYS1kaWdpdGFsLXZlcnNpb24tb24tdGhlaXItbW9iaWxlLWRldmljZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Courtesy: Thales’ Website

Florida residents will soon have access to a mobile version of their FDL.

Thales, a French-based global technology company, reached an agreement with the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles that will allow drivers of the state to carry a digital copy of their driver’s license via smartphones and tablets.

Terry L. Rhodes, Executive Director of the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles had this to say about the partnership, “I’m excited for this innovation project that will make the state of Florida a national leader in offering secure and trusted mobile identification, which is a priority for our Governor, Ron DeSantis.”

According to Thales’ press release, the mobile driver’s license will carry the same validity as the physical copy drivers currently use, ultimately serving as a primary ID that may be used for identity verification and proof of age and driving privileges.

Aside from serving the traditional purposes of current ID’s, the new mobile version will provide strong authentication for a variety of online services.

The mobile version will allow for convenient, contact-free authentication by allowing the user to simply select the type of verification needed and holding up their mobile device through the identification app.

“We have made a sustained commitment to the modernization of nearly every aspect of what our department does and how customers access our services, and Thales will be a great partner as Florida now steps into the future of mobile identification,” said Rhodes.

The mobile identification method will provide a plethora of advantages when compared to its physical counterpart.

They are harder to counterfeit due to a secure digitized credential that can be checked rather than simply displaying an image that is otherwise easily manipulated.

Convenience. Merging everyday-carry and identification.

Privacy. Eliminating full-display of all information on the ID based on the scenario in which it is being used.

Contact-free. No more having to hand over your license, eliminating possible contamination and spread of germs.

To elaborate on the stronger privacy advantage: users will be afforded the ability to control what information is being presented in a given scenario. For example, when entering a casino, the official checking your ID only needs to be shown a digital image and the age of the person entering. Your address, specific date of birth, and name will be completely private because of the software security technology within the app.

“As ID fraud becomes more frequent and sophisticated, we made it a priority to reinforce ID verification by adding extra software security technologies,” said Tony Lo Brutto, VP NORAM, Identity and Biometric Solutions at Thales. “In the future, enterprises such as airports, hotels, car rental companies etc, in Florida will be able to rely on Thales to identify customers, while guaranteeing their privacy.”

Thales secured a $2 million grant in 2016 by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology to support a pilot trial and the development of digital driver’s licenses in four states and districts— Colorado, Idaho, Maryland, and Washington D.C.

However, Florida residents will be able to apply for digital licenses sometime in 2021. The state will be the first in the country to deploy and implement such a program.

The days of forgetting your wallet and license at home will no longer be a burden if you are stopped on the road or need to present your license in any situation.
