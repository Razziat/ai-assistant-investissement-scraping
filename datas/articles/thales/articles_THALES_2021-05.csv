The study is part of the Lunar Communications and Navigation Services (LCNS) project within ESA's Moonlight initiative, which aims to create a financially sustainable infrastructure to provide lunar communications and navigation services.

The study will define the architecture and service delivery model for the future development of a complete (end-to-end) system, using existing terrestrial infrastructures and building space assets, such as dedicated satellites, or elements on the lunar surface capable of providing services to the different platforms either arriving on the Moon, orbiting the Moon or landing on its surface, such as rovers, landers or lunar bases, thus identifying key elements for future missions.

Together with Telespazio, Thales Alenia Space will be responsible for the definition and design of the entire system, as well as for the design of the space segment (elements orbiting around the Moon) and the lunar segment (elements on the surface of the Moon). The synergy established with Telespazio will ensure the optimisation of the system.

Thales Alenia Space is the perfect partner for such an ambitious project. The company leverages both the expertise developed in the production of the Galileo satellites since the Programme's inception, as well as its experience gained in the development of ESPRIT, the communications and refuelling module that, together with I-HAB (International Habitat), the module that will host the astronauts, represents one of the key elements for the future Lunar Orbital Platform - Gateway (LOP-G).

The technologies inherited from the navigation systems and communication elements under development, related to both the optical range and the radiofrequency, enable Thales Alenia Space to minimise development risks by guaranteeing the demanding requirements associated with this mission.

Thales Alenia Space will be supported by small and medium-sized companies, such as Argotec, specialised in micro-satellites, and Quascom, specialised in navigation systems, that could enable the deployment of small constellations to demonstrate the functionality of the proposed solutions before large-scale development or to increase the capacity of the communication and navigation system in case of specific requirements.

Within this initiative, Altec ( JV Thales Alenia Space 63,75% and Italian Space Agency 36,25%) plays a role in the ground infrastructure, supporting Telespazio in the design and production of the ground segment, exploiting the capabilities gained from the constant support provided to ISS and ExoMars Rover Module.

Communication and positioning systems will play a key role in supporting exploration missions to our satellite, for example by ensuring constant link between astronauts and robotic systems and control centres, as well as the correct and precise positioning of autonomous driving and human-controlled exploration vehicles on the surface, and the navigation during the cruise and landing phases of spacecraft travelling between Earth and the Moon. Furthermore, these services will support the emergence and development of the future 'Lunar Economy', both in terms of space tourism and, for example, the possibility of using on-site lunar mineral resources, making it easier and cheaper to explore the other planets in the solar system while limiting the impact of mining on our planet.

"Thales, Atos take on big data and artificial intelligence in new joint venture - Defense News","Thu, 27 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9pbmR1c3RyeS8yMDIxLzA1LzI3L3RoYWxlcy1hdG9zLXRha2Utb24tYmlnLWRhdGEtYW5kLWFydGlmaWNpYWwtaW50ZWxsaWdlbmNlLWluLW5ldy1qb2ludC12ZW50dXJlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"STUTTGART, Germany — Two major French technology companies are joining forces in an effort to become the European nation’s premier institution for artificial intelligence and big-data efforts.

Thales and Atos announced Thursday the creation of a joint venture called Athea, along with plans to develop a flagship, sovereign, big-data and AI platform that could serve customers in the public and private sector.

This new partnership comes as nations across Europe, and beyond, are targeting AI and big data as key enabling technologies for future military capabilities.

“With the exponential rise in the number of sources of information, and increased pressure to respond more quickly to potential issues, state agencies need to manage ever-greater volumes of heterogeneous data and accelerate the development of new AI applications where security and sovereignty are key,” the companies said in a news release.

The two teams began discussing the potential of a joint venture several months ago, per a Thales spokesperson.

“Together, we will capitalise on our respective areas of expertise to provide best-in-class big data and artificial intelligence solutions,” Marc Darmon, executive vice president for secure communications and information systems at Thales, said in a statement.

Athea will draw on each company’s work on Project Artemis — meant to provide the French military with a big-data processing capability — to build a system that securely handles sensitive data on “a nationwide scale” and that will also support the solution’s implementation within government programs, per the joint news release.

Both Atos and Thales have worked on the demonstration phase for Artemis, awarded in 2017, and both were chosen in April to prepare the full-scale rollout of the program by the French military procurement agency DGA.

“Athea will generate huge potential for innovation, and stimulate the industrial and defence ecosystem, including innovative start-ups, to meet the needs of government agencies and other stakeholders in the sector,” said Pierre Barnabé, senior executive vice president for big data and cybersecurity at Atos.

Athea will initially focus on the French market before addressing European requirements “at a later date,” the companies said. This indicates that the joint venture will not affect ongoing multinational projects, such as Thales’ work on the Franco-German-Spanish Future Combat Air System or NATO’s deployable combat cloud program.

For the air system, Thales is an industry partner for two of the program’s seven technology pillars: the air combat cloud — for which the industry lead is Airbus — and the advanced sensors pillar, led by Indra. The company was also selected by the NATO Communications and Information Agency to develop and build the alliance’s first theater-level, deployable defense cloud capability, dubbed Firefly, within the next two years.

A Thales spokesperson said Athea might very well work with NATO in the future as the alliance pursues new emerging and disruptive technologies, including AI and big data.

NATO has identified those two capabilities as the first tech areas to target under its recently established emerging and disruptive technology strategy. It plans to release a strategy dedicated solely to artificial intelligence this summer, aligned with the NATO Summit scheduled for June 14 in Brussels.

Thales Delivers First Sea Fire Next Gen Radar for France's New Frigates - Naval News,"Wed, 19 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA1L3RoYWxlcy1kZWxpdmVycy1maXJzdC1zZWEtZmlyZS1uZXh0LWdlbi1yYWRhci1mb3ItZnJhbmNlcy1uZXctZnJpZ2F0ZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Delivers First Sea Fire Next Gen Radar for France’s New Frigates On April 27th 2021, Thales delivered the first digital Sea Fire radar for integration on the French Navy’s FDI Frigate in Lorient.

The milestone follows a seven-year development and is in-line with the French defence procurement agency’s initial schedule.

Thales press release

Launched in 2014, the first of the five Sea Fire AESA digital radars for French Navy’s future Frégate de Défense et d’Intervention (FDI) arrived at the Lorient shipyard on April 27th 2021 for integration on the first vessel.

Today’s naval forces face faster, more manoeuvrable and increasingly complex threats. Vessels need protection from conventional ballistic or air threats, surface and asymmetric threats, but also from high-velocity and saturation attacks. At the same time, they have to take into account reduced crewing requirements, the need for improved maintenance and the imperatives of cybersecurity.

Sea Fire is the solution of choice for commanders responsible for ensuring vessel survivability in the face of a rapidly expanding array of threats. With its fully solid-state four-panel AESA antenna, Sea Fire can search for air and surface targets simultaneously, scanning an area of several hundred square kilometres with 360° coverage in azimuth, 90° in elevation and an unmatched refresh rate.

The first SeaFire radar array at the Thales facility in Limours in 2019.

This digital radar is at the forefront of technological innovation and benefits from all Thales’s Big Data and cybersecurity expertise. Subsequent software developments will further improve the product’s performance and operational availability throughout its lifecycle. The huge volumes of data generated by each panel — in the order of one terabit per second — can be processed using advanced algorithms to optimize the radar’s performance in its specific operating environment. This new AESA fixed-array radar offers twice the operational availability of earlier-generation radar systems with mechanically scanned antennas.

Manufactured in Limours, south of Paris, with the involvement of a French network of small medium- sized companies, the Sea Fire started production in May 2018 and successfully passed initial qualification tests late 2020. Despite difficulties caused by the Covid-19 crisis, Thales aligned with the initial schedule planned, delivering the first of five Sea Fire radars on time to the Lorient shipyard for integration.

“Drawing on more than 70 years of Thales experience in the field of surface radars, the Sea Fire is designed to help navies to counter all types of threats, from slow-moving targets to supersonic missiles. Thales is proud to be on board the future FDI frigates with a digital radar that brings modern frigates the same power and performance as a destroyer and ensures that commanders can fulfil their mission with optimum safety.”

Rémi Mongabure, Bids Director for multifunction radars at Thales

Naval News comments:

Artist impression of the future FDI / Amiral Ronarc’h-class Frigate of the French Navy (seen here in its final configuration). DGA picture.

The SEA FIRE is a multi function radar consisting in four non-rotating arrays (similar to the Lockheed Martin SPY-1 family of radars) and benefiting from the latest gallium nitride (GaN) high-power amplifier technology (similar to Raytheon SPY-6 family).

The SEA FIRE provides early warning of potential attacks from conventional and emerging air and surface threats using long-range 3D surveillance, horizon search, and surface surveillance. Its 360-degree coverage can track 800 objects simultaneously without saturation at a range of up to 500 kilometers in the air and 80 kilometers on the surface.

Besides the FDI frigates (including those proposed to the Hellenic Navy), Thales is already pitching its new radar for export (likely for the Republic of Singapore Navy’s MRCV program). A variant of the radar will also be fitted aboard the future aircraft carrier of the French Navy, the PANG.

Combined teams of DGA, the French Navy (Marine Nationale), Thales and Naval Group started land based tests at the so-called “shore integration facility” in September 2019. Here is our report recorded at the time:"

“These capabilities are critical to cloud migration and security, particularly with such accelerated growth during this area,” said Sunil Potti, vice president, and general manager of Google Cloud Security. “True to our mission, we have forged this collaboration with Thales to further protect our customer’s most sensitive info. we are empowering customers to leverage the total potential of Google Cloud technology for sensitive workloads, by utilizing the Customer-Managed encryption Key-integrated GCP services, Cipher Trust Cloud Key Manager and SafeNet Trusted Access for access management and authentication from Thales. This can enable enterprises to deal with fluid and dynamic business surroundings where protecting sensitive data within the cloud is of extreme importance.”

Simplifying Multicloud Security

As customers look to reap the rewards from multicloud environments, Thales is creating it easier to confirm protection against reputational risk and financial penalties arising from a cloud data breach. As such, customers will benefit from enhanced capabilities to find, defend and control sensitive data across multicloud environments, as well as the ability to:

Discover Sensitive Data in the Cloud and On-Premises

Thales Data Discovery and Classification automates the discovery, classification, and protection of data within the cloud and on-premises using automation policies that identify sensitive data and protect the data with encryption or tokenization. These capabilities have currently been extended to the discovery and classification of data in Amazon Web Services S3 buckets and Azure Blob storage.

Protect Sensitive Data and Workloads in the Cloud

To address both the complexity of where data is stored and to assist ensure data sovereignty in a multicloud environment, effective encryption and tokenization are required. Specific new data protection capabilities for cloud platforms include:

CipherTrust Transparent Encryption for advanced encryption and access controls protects data in Amazon Web Services Simple Storage Service (S3)

Encryption of Kubernetes secrets and Google Anthos Service Mesh signing keys

Recommended AI News: BitKan Smart Trade adds OKEx Swap

Control Access to Applications and Sensitive Data in the Cloud

The accelerated adoption of encryption has led to the need to manage a far larger variety of encryption keys across both traditional information stores and multicloud environments. Thales has enabled new capabilities that permit organizations to control access to data and ownership of their encryption keys, including:

Thales is also giving CipherTrust Cloud Key Manager Support for Google Cloud’s External Key Manager (EKM), building on the present CipherTrust Key Broker for Google Cloud EKM which is part of the Thales Data Protection on Demand cloud-based platform.

Secure and Protect access at the Login Point

Compromised identities pose one of the greatest risks for data breaches:

SafeNet Trusted Access integrates out of the box with Google Workspace, Azure, and AWS, enforcing the appropriate access controls and authentication for privileged and regular users.

SafeNet Trusted Access is offering new abilities to provide authentication and authorization for APIs and for applications not using industry-standard protocols such as SAML and OIDC.

“The proliferation of multi-cloud computing has created new organizational challenges in managing information across many alternative cloud environments. while organizations have benefited from scalability and speed to market thanks to the power of the cloud, the ever-increasing IT cloud landscape has added larger complexity to information management and security,” said Sébastien Cano, Senior vice president, Cloud Protection and Licensing activities at Thales. “In a post-pandemic, highly regulated world, it’s even more vital for organizations to understand what data they have, where it sits, who will access it, and the risks related to managing it. Only once a corporation understands all of those data lifecycle aspects, will they ensure that it’s secured and managed correctly.”

That’s what my father says whenever I ask him: “What do they make? Who do they sell them to?” “Only to the good guys,”​​​​ is his standard answer, and the topic changes quickly. But what he calls “trucks”, most people call “tanks”. And ​I am always led to wonder, “What kind of ‘good guy’ drives a tank?”

My father works for Thales, one of the richest weapons corporations in the world. Before heading up security for Thales he worked for Asio, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation.

On a rainy summer’s day in January I learnt that Thales sells weaponised vehicles to Indonesia’s special forces, Kopassus. The same Kopassus that have been accused of terrorising, torturing and murdering the people of West Papua.

My partner is a West Papuan refugee. Half of our children’s family live in West Papua, terrified of Indonesian soldiers, ready to run when Kopassus troops roll into their villages. I was suddenly painfully aware that my father is paid by a company that sells weapons that may be used against his own grandchildren’s family.

I had always suspected that my father’s employer and my partner’s journey might be connected in some way but I had never imagined how horribly entangled their stories were.

View image in fullscreen Lober Wanggai and Izzy Brown protest outside the Indonesian consulate

Lober, my partner and father of three of my children, landed in Cape York, Australia on 17 January 2006 in an outrigger canoe with 42 other refugees from West Papua. All were detained on Christmas Island before being granted asylum. Indonesia took offence at Australia’s acceptance of them and targeted their families. Lober’s mother was arrested in retribution. Friends and family members of these Papuans in exile have been arrested, tortured and killed. Like most refugees from war zones, the West Papuan 43 carry a burden of trauma that includes survivor guilt: why am I safe when others are dying?

Indonesia invaded then-Dutch West Papua in 1962. In 1969, with the backing of the UN, Indonesia’s dictator Suharto claimed West Papua as a province of Indonesia. Successive Australian administrations, eager to appease Indonesia, have remained silent on human rights abuses in Timor-Leste, Aceh, Maluku, Jakarta and West Papua. The rare exceptions to the policy of appeasement – such as sending peacekeepers to Timor-Leste in 1999 and accepting the 43 West Papuan refugees in 2006 – have resulted in diplomatic standoffs and the cessation of military cooperation.

If it’s true that change begins at home, I hope my father will be ready

To resolve these pesky human rights issues, Australia and Indonesia signed the Lombok treaty in 2006. This pact preserves military and diplomatic cooperation with the promise that there will be no interference or comment on the “internal” affairs, or “sovereignty”, of the other state. The Lombok treaty is effectively a gag order.

Australia’s Special Air Service is involved in military training with Kopassus in Perth and the Australian federal police trains Indonesia’s anti-terror squad D88 at an Australian-funded institute called JCLEC (the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation).

Kopassus and D88 are the most feared of all Indonesian security forces and have been implicated in torture and extrajudicial killings across the archipelago. According to Amnesty International, more than 30 Papuans have been murdered by Indonesian forces in the past two years. Amnesty also alleges that between 2010 and 2018, Indonesia’s police and military were responsible for at least 95 unlawful killings in Papua, including targeted slayings of activists , a claim the Indonesian army’s spokesman in Papua province, Col. Muhammad Aidi, rejected as “untrue and baseless.”

Australia’s military support and defence exports to Indonesia directly contribute to the suffering of communities in West Papua, and cause great anguish to the West Papuans who now call Australia home. Every West Papuan-Australian I meet is scarred by the “low-intensity conflict” that has raged over access to Papua’s natural resources since 1962.

Some of the older men who travelled on the canoe with Lober spend their days walking and walking and walking. Sometimes Lober walks all night. Where are they going? What are they looking for? When I ask, the response is always the same: just walking, jalan jalan.

Thales rates high in both global exports and reach, with operations in 56 countries and defence revenue of US$9.25bn in 2019. Thales Australia’s big-ticket export item is the Bushmaster weaponised vehicle, including guns and ordnance. In 2013 Thales sold three Bushmaster vehicles to Kopassus in a A$2.7m deal brokered by the then Australian military sales office. In October 2016, Australian and Indonesian defence industry officials signed an agreement to produce the Sanca, a weaponised vehicle based on the Bushmaster.

While in West Papua in 2013 I met dozens of activists, students and political prisoners. Their call for peace, justice and freedom from Indonesian rule was unanimous. The women’s stories really hit home: “Why do I have children just to watch them die at the hands of Indonesia?” I heard this question across Papua from mothers who had suffered the worst grief of all: burying their children.

Now three of my own children have West Papuan heritage, and their grandfather is working for the company that sells the weapons to the army that causes so many mothers grief.

If it’s true that change begins at home, I hope my father will be ready. My four kids often spend time with their Australian grandparents. My father is a popular visitor. He is funny and fabulous and impossible to dislike, though I don’t like what the company he works for sells.

One day his grandchildren will understand how implicated the company he works for is in the violence in their father’s land. Will he be ready, I wonder, for the day they understand and the questions they will ask?"

Thales Creates Acoustic Shot Detector Sensor for Maritime Environment - Naval News,"Fri, 14 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDIxLzA1L3RoYWxlcy1jcmVhdGVzLWFjb3VzdGljLXNob3QtZGV0ZWN0b3Itc2Vuc29yLWZvci1tYXJpdGltZS1lbnZpcm9ubWVudC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Creates Acoustic Shot Detector Sensor for Maritime Environment Acusonic by Thales detects incoming fire from about 1.5 kilometers (0.93 miles) away for “large caliber small arms fire.” This acoustic direction-finding sensor system can be mounted on army armored vehicles and small naval maritime vessels.

Thales UK reached out to Naval News in late April 2021 to discuss their unique sensor that can detect incoming sniper, small arms fire, and cannon fire.

“Acusonic™ is differentiated in the marketplace through both its performance and SWAP/form factor [SWAP stands for size, weight, and power]. Regarding the former, Acusonic contains unique algorithms that give it unmatched performance in challenging acoustic environments, such as on vehicles or vessels traveling at speed. Regarding the later, Acusonic was designed to be rugged and low profile. Potential challenges facing [competitor] solutions which utilize microphones on vertically protruding masts include a) being more vulnerable to damage, b) interfering with optics and weapons line of sight and c) not being conducive to platform “stealth.” Acusonic, by design, does not face these challenges. Lastly, other competitors in the gunshot detection market offer a “one size fits all” solution, with each platform receiving the standard system regardless of size or configuration. Acusonic on the other hand is scalable, starting from a single sensor and increasing to the tri-sensor solution seen on AJAX [UK’s armored fighting vehicle]. Thales will assess each platform and can offer the best suited Acusonic configuration according to the platform design and customer need.

“Acusonic was born out of the acoustic expertise gained from Thales’ pedigree as the world’s top exporter of naval sonar systems. This acoustic expertise has been transferred from the underwater environment to the airborne environment to build the underlying algorithms which are at the center of Acusonic’s shot detection capability.

“The system is already certified to IP-67, and Thales is exploring a number of further modifications where necessary to further protect the sensor heads in the maritime environment.”

–Tom Kinnaird from the Thales Acusonic team, Thales UK Limited

IP-67 stands for “Ingress Protection” and is 100% protected against solid objects such as dust and sand, and can withstand being submerged for at least 30 minutes in 15 centimeters to 1 meter of water.

“As far as Thales UK are aware, it is the first acoustic shot detection system that has successfully undertaken a live firing trial on a maritime vessel. Acusonic detects and combines two key sounds associated with incoming hostile fire: the supersonic shockwave of the bullet and the muzzle blast. Unique algorithms in Acusonic’s software then use this data to derive range, bearing and caliber of incoming fire,” said Adrian Rondel of Thales UK.

Thales Acusonic detects incoming fire from 360-degrees around and being dome-shaped, offers a lower profile. Here the Acusonic is mounted on a P950 RHIB in the open water. Photo: Thales.

The entire highly-sensitive and accurate passive detection system consists of dome-shaped microphones and a display screen with buttons that overlays a top-view map of the surrounding area and a circular compass grid shows the direction the shot came from. Any incoming fire is plotted and marked with a red arrow to denote where the fire originated from. Crews can then take evasive, defensive, or offensive action against the hostile incoming fire, or launch necessary countermeasures. Thus, Acusonic’s state-of-the-art system provides crews better life-saving situational awareness in rugged and extreme environments and integrates in their Command, Control, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence (C4I) systems.

For the past four decades, Thales has been providing operational information technology to the RAF.

According to Thales, continued investment in MD MSS will allow wider ‘multi-domain integration’ and boost further ‘joint inter-operability and digital transformation’.

In the maritime domain, the capability can also be used on board the Royal Navy’s new Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales to support air operations by the Carrier Strike Group (CSG).

Thales UK CEO and chairman Alex Cresswell said: “We are delighted to be continuing our strong relationship with the RAF and we are very proud that MD MSS continues to be the RAF’s mission system of choice for its air platforms.

“No other MoD digital solution provides the same functionality and information sources, which spans mission planning and intelligence in an end-to-end all-encompassing solution.”

Thales stated that the latest contract would secure 150 jobs in the UK and includes a team of 40 software engineers based in the company’s Templecombe facility in Somerset.

The contract also includes field service engineers supporting 19 ground locations in the UK and abroad."

The Communications Management System upgrade has been completed before HMS Queen Elizabeth sets sail as the flagship of Carrier Strike Group 21 (CSG21).

As well as operating as an aircraft carrier, one of the key capabilities of the ship will be able to act as a key focus of command for the CSG21 multi-nation task groups and inter-navy training that will be such a critical feature of 2021 operations.

HMS Queen Elizabeth is the largest and most powerful vessel ever constructed for the Royal Navy. The warship is capable of carrying up to 40 aircraft and a maximum crew of around 1,600 personnel, which includes the regular ship’s company and embarked forces, including the Air Wing.

“We are extremely proud to have worked alongside the Royal Navy and MOD to upgrade HMS Queen Elizabeth with its initial communications system which was world leading. But this upgrade takes the carrier’s capability to a whole new level, enabling the carrier as a cutting edge command platform for both the Royal Navy and other navies which is such an essential feature of international naval operations today. Completing the upgrade before CSG21 was a time critical factor, where it will require embarking Battle staff and Commander Task Group who will command the group and others during multi-national exercises from a strategic level. But longer term, it allows the carrier to integrate seamlessly and command a task group from the flagship and react accordingly to any future operations.”

What do the Eurovision Song Contest and a printed circuit board factory have in common? Whether it’s pulling off the largest musical event on the planet or assembling high-tech computer boards, neither can be done effectively any more without a digital platform to securely share operational data between all people involved. Mike Balm and his digital transformation team at Thales are there to help set it up.

The Zwarte Cross is the largest paid festival in the Netherlands, with an estimated 220,000 fans in attendance. To control this crowd, the event organisers hire a security crew to patrol the festival grounds and coordinate with emergency services outside the gates. It’s of vital importance – sometimes literally, in the event of emergencies – to regulate the flow of information between all parties in such a way that everyone involved is able to perform their duties in bringing the event to a successful conclusion.

“To streamline the collaboration at the Zwarte Cross, we built a platform connecting all stakeholders on a need-to-know basis,” says Mike Balm from Thales. “Everyone has a dashboard showing exactly the information they need to do their work at any given moment. For example, the security crew can see their own positions, but not the location of the police – until there’s an emergency in which they require the help of law enforcement, at which point this information is automatically made available to them. The Zwarte Cross was our maiden voyage, after which we developed the platform into a fully-fledged service offering, called Secured Sharing.” (Read all about the Secured Sharing platform here.)

Balm is one of what Thales calls its digital champions. Together with his team in Hengelo, he’s powering digital transformation, both inside the company and outside, for customers. “We’re working with several key focal points. One is end-user functionality – shifting focus from the product to what the end-user really wants. Cybersecurity is very important as well, crucial even, as information is increasingly being digitally shared between parties. Other focal points include doing more in the cloud and being more service-oriented.”

Highly agile

Within Thales, Balm and his team are leading the push from digitisation to digitalisation. “We’ve made the transition from paper to bits and bytes. We’ve deployed all kinds of digital systems to make our work easier, for enterprise resource planning, as well as the management of customer relationships and product lifecycles. Unfortunately, they all generated spreadsheets – we were running on Excel. But we don’t want columns with raw data; we want dashboards with insightful graphs. We don’t want everyone using their own spreadsheets; we want an interlinked system based on a single source of truth. When a product is ready to leave our factory, we want fully automated processes to have taken care of the customs documents and all the other necessary paperwork.”

Speaking of factories, Balm is adamant about boosting efficiency there, too. “Our manufacturing operations weren’t nearly as high tech as the products they make. There was a lot of room for improvement. For example, we have our own printed circuit board factory, including our own cleanroom. They used to write everything down on paper – the temperatures of the chemical baths, everything. There’s much to gain by automating the data collection and analysis. Instead of cleaning those chemical baths at the same time each week, we could tune the intervals to the live measurement data. Using Internet-of-Things technology, we’re working hard to make Industry 4.0 a reality there.”

In tackling the digitalisation challenges, Balm’s team is leveraging super-agility and extensive user experience (UX) expertise. “With our UX specialists, we’re taking a deep dive into the organisation. By comparing our current way of working to how we envision it in the future, we’re uncovering all kinds of bottlenecks. To solve them, we take a highly agile, highly incremental approach, which starts with building a minimum viable product in two weeks, using a low-code platform like Mendix.”

Triply secured

As well as guiding the digital transformation within Thales, Balm is heading the further rollout of the Secured Sharing service to external customers, such as the Netherlands Coastguard. “The coastguard is responsible for everything that happens at sea, including shipping and fishery. It’s a compound organisation, calling on the resources and services of the navy and the police, for example. This requires a lot of coordination, on a need-to-know basis. The coastguard can be involved in a black-ops operation in which a police patrol ship is sailing under the radar to intercept drug traffickers, but when one of the policemen falls overboard, the context changes from security to safety and all the stops are pulled out to rescue him. The sharing of information has to dynamically change with the situation – which is where our platform comes in.”

The Secured Sharing service creates what is known as an information hub that allows very precise control of who gets to see what and when. Balm: “Our platform integrates all the data sources in an organisation. The information you don’t want to share stays in a classified environment; what you do want to make available goes into a shared space, with each component encrypted separately. You decide who has access to which pieces of information, and for how long, by distributing specific decryption keys to specific hub members for specific time slots. You can also specify how this access changes when the context changes, i.e. what digital doors to open in the event of an emergency.”

Balm explains that information hubs can be implemented in one of three ways. “The first is locally, in which case the

customer places a dedicated server on the edge of his network, separated from the other computers by a firewall. The second is on our premises, completely under the customer’s control and totally inaccessible to us. The third is in the cloud, hosted by Microsoft in Amsterdam. In each setup, the information on the server can be accessed using a standard web browser, but the connection is triply secured: through a VPN tunnel, authentications and a browser extension running browser-level encryption. When hosted by us, we provide additional security through our Security Operations Centre.”

Tour de force

Other users include the Royal Netherlands Air Force and the International Zone in The Hague, home to Europol, the International Court of Justice, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and soon several embassies as well. “The Dutch air force wants to improve its collaboration with local authorities. Using our platform, it’s moving from a highly classified, air-gapped network to an information-centric ecosystem with bi-directional sharing of intelligence. This enables it to respond much more rapidly when its assistance is required,” Balm points out. “The International Zone uses our platform to coordinate its security efforts.”

We’ve done the Tour de France, connecting twenty different parties and sharing sensitive safety and security information, among other things. - Mike Balm

Since being used at the Zwarte Cross, the Secured Sharing service has also been deployed at several other major public events. “We’ve done the Tour de France, connecting twenty different parties and sharing sensitive safety and security information, among other things. We were set to do the Giro d’Italia, which was to visit the Netherlands last year, and the Eurovision Song Contest in Rotterdam – until they got cancelled due to corona. Eurovision in particular would have been a real tour de force: coordinating all the logistics and massive crowd movements to and from the venue, whilst monitoring social media for potential security threats.”

“These use cases all boil down to the same thing,” Balm concludes. “They involve connecting multiple stakeholders and their wide variety of information sources in such a way that they can work together on a need-to-know basis. We’ve built a platform that enables exactly this and that can be expanded to different markets.”

On April 27th 2021, Thales delivered the first digital Sea Fire radar for integration on the French Navy’s first Defence and Intervention Frigate in Lorient.

A key milestone in the FDI programme, following a seven-year development and in-line with the French defence procurement agency’s initial schedule.

The Sea Fire is the latest-generation solid-state modular multifunction radar, with a four-panel AESA1 antenna, simultaneously performing long-range air and surface surveillance, as well as fire control to protect the French frigates from all types of threats in complex environments.

Representation of the Sea Fire radar on the mast of a frigate

Launched in 2014, the first of the five Sea Fire AESA digital radars for French Navy’s future Frégate de Défense et d’Intervention (FDI) arrived at the Lorient shipyard on April 27th 2021 for integration on the first vessel.

Today's naval forces face faster, more manoeuvrable and increasingly complex threats. Vessels need protection from conventional ballistic or air threats, surface and asymmetric threats, but also from high-velocity and saturation attacks. At the same time, they have to take into account reduced crewing requirements, the need for improved maintenance and the imperatives of cybersecurity.

Sea Fire is the solution of choice for commanders responsible for ensuring vessel survivability in the face of a rapidly expanding array of threats. With its fully solid-state four-panel AESA antenna, Sea Fire can search for air and surface targets simultaneously, scanning an area of several hundred square kilometres with 360° coverage in azimuth, 90° in elevation and an unmatched refresh rate.

This digital radar is at the forefront of technological innovation and benefits from all Thales's Big Data and cybersecurity expertise. Subsequent software developments will further improve the product’s performance and operational availability throughout its lifecycle. The huge volumes of data generated by each panel — in the order of one terabit per second — can be processed using advanced algorithms to optimize the radar’s performance in its specific operating environment. This new AESA fixed-array radar offers twice the operational availability of earlier-generation radar systems with mechanically scanned antennas.

Manufactured in Limours, south of Paris, with the involvement of a French network of small medium- sized companies, the Sea Fire started production in May 2018 and successfully passed initial qualification tests late 2020. Despite difficulties caused by the Covid-19 crisis, Thales aligned with the initial schedule planned, delivering the first of five Sea Fire radars on time to the Lorient shipyard for integration.

“Drawing on more than 70 years of Thales experience in the field of surface radars, the Sea Fire is designed to help navies to counter all types of threats, from slow-moving targets to supersonic missiles. Thales is proud to be on board the future FDI frigates with a digital radar that brings modern frigates the same power and performance as a destroyer and ensures that commanders can fulfil their mission with optimum safety.” Rémi Mongabure, Bids Director for multifunction radars at Thales."

HMS Queen Elizabeth, the most powerful surface vessel in the history of the Royal Navy, sets sail as the flagship of the largest concentration of UK maritime and air power in a generation, visiting more than 40 countries over the next six months.

Thales is proud to say we have been at the heart of the story of this remarkable ship from the very beginning and will be providing the critical eyes and ears capabilities of the accompanying surface, underwater and airborne assets – a partnership with the navy we can trace back over 100 years.

Today, almost every single submarine and surface ship in the fleet uses various combinations of our sonar, radar, communications, electro-optical systems and electronic warfare technology. Thousands of highly-skilled jobs at our sites across the UK and our supply chain have delivered the technology that will protect the CSG deployment.

Both HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales were built and delivered under a unique partnering relationship between Thales, BAE Systems, Babcock and the UK Ministry of Defence, in an enterprise known as the Aircraft Carrier Alliance.

Originally designed by Thales, the giant 65,000 tonne carrier has a unique twin island configuration, allowing the forward island to control and navigate the ship while the rear island can control and operate the fast jet and helicopters deployed on board.

Due to its innovative design and use of automation, the ship’s company numbers just 700, increasing to around 1,600 when a full complement of F-35B jets and Merlin helicopters are embarked. Compare this to other similar-sized carriers from other navies that have crews of 2,000 and more.

The Thales contribution to the ship has been nationwide – Thales’s Bristol-based office became a critical part of the programme, with around 200 alliance engineers responsible for the naval architecture, design and power and propulsion for these two mighty vessels.

The voice of the ship comes from our state-of-the-art naval communications facilities at Crawley in West Sussex, enabling critical comms with the crew, aircraft and other ships. A recent extensive naval communications upgrade has established an additional command operations centre on board to direct wider task group operations.

On top of the forward island is the S1850M radar, developed by our colleagues in the Netherlands, providing the ship with critical long range cover and capable of automatic detection and tracking of up to 1000 air targets, up to a range of 400km. It can spot a golf ball sized object from 60 km away.

At Templecombe in Somerset and Cheadle Heath near Manchester, Thales engineers have provided the ships and submarine with critical sonar systems to detect underwater threats. Merlin helicopters fitted with Thales FLASH-dipping sonar will work with anti-submarine warfare frigates fitted with Thales Sonar 2087 to keep the seas clear of submarines.

Threat-sensing electronic warfare from Crawley protects the ring of warships around the flagship.

Under the waves, the Astute submarine – the most advanced hunter-killer submarine in its class – operates with our eyes and ears provided by Sonar 2076 from Templecombe and Cheadle and an optronic mast from Glasgow. Since 1917, every single Royal Navy submarine has operated with a periscope or optronic mast designed and manufactured by our engineers in Scotland.

In the air, Merlin helicopters fitted with the new Crowsnest system from Crawley will help protect the carrier with airborne surveillance and the control. Wildcat helicopters fitted with the LMM missile system from Belfast will provide a formidable line of defence.

Alex Cresswell, CEO and Chairman of Thales in the UK, said: “There is truly a remarkable tale of British engineering and skills behind this deployment. HMS Queen Elizabeth is an iconic symbol of what industry and the Ministry of Defence can achieve together. I am very proud of the part Thales will play in CSG 21 and I am equally as proud of all our employees who have contributed so superbly to make it happen.”

Although certified under these international standards since 2016, Thales AWS has recently achieved re-certification for the HUON Class Minehunter In Service Support Contract in Q1 2021, with Lloyds Register. The MHC ISS Contract provides Asset Management Services including planning, engineering, logistics, configuration, maintenance and material management support services to the Royal Australian Navy's HUON Class Minehunters.

What is ISO?

ISO, which stands for International Organisation for Standardisation, is an independent, non-governmental international organisation with membership of over 165 national standards bodies.

They are the world’s largest developer of international standards that give market relevant, state of the art specifications for products, services and good practice. Developed through global consensus, they are a critical component of international trade and removing barriers to working across various countries; something Thales does daily.

What do ISO do?

Since they were founded in 1946, ISO have published more than 23000 standards covering areas including electrical engineering, military engineering, clothing industry and ship building and marine structures. The development of these standards reduces the need for national standards and benefits both major organisations and owner operators.

What is ISO55001 Certification?

ISO55001 identifies the requirements of a management system (for the management of Assets specifically) and clearly positions asset management as a key element of the broader business management system including, but not limited to, safety management, people management and financial management.

Why is ISO 55001 Certification so important?

Thales Above Water Systems are an Industry Leader in the Asset Management, providing 30 years of ship repair, engineering design and defect rectification to the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). The high availability of RAN platforms experienced by our CASG and RAN customers, demonstrate the effectiveness of Thales Asset Management practices. Adherence to the highest, and globally recognised, standards are critical. Not only does this re-certification ensure the Royal Australian Navy can have the utmost confidence in our work, but also reaffirms that we’re aligned with global standards of Asset Management.

What makes Thales ISO 55001 different?

Thales certified our MHC ISS Contract as our Asset, rather than the RAN’s platforms. This approach was recognised by the Asset Management Council in 2018, where Thales received an Innovation Award."
Maritime Mine Countermeasures Programme (MMCM): The success of at-sea demonstrations turns the spotlight to the ... - Thales,"Mon, 10 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvZGVmZW5jZS1hbmQtc2VjdXJpdHkvbWFnYXppbmUvbWFyaXRpbWUtbWluZS1jb3VudGVybWVhc3VyZXMtcHJvZ3JhbW1lLW1tY20tc3VjY2Vzcy1zZWHSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In 2015, with growing numbers of mines in the world’s oceans, France and the UK set themselves a clear mine countermeasures (MCM) challenge: to drive a step change in their navies’ mine warfare performance and significantly improve the safety of personnel. The ambition was immense: the development of an integrated, high-tech, ‘system of systems’ that could be flown quickly across the world; to make rapid programme progress, in an area with no established doctrine; and to have cast-iron certainty on reliability, autonomy, and cybersecurity.

With such high stakes, the breadth of skills and experience needed to make this vision a reality had to be equally ambitious. It would include a substantial capacity for high-tech R&D and the capability to manage and deliver complex projects. After a demanding, three-year competition, the countries selected Thales to lead the work. Its brief? To rigorously demonstrate fully unmanned MCM, in challenging seas – within five years.

Fast forward to today and the navies’ audacity has been rewarded. A reliable, ‘first-of-its-kind’ system has been thoroughly demonstrated and will be delivered against requirements. How though was this success achieved? First, Thales’s commitment matched that of the navies. With a heavy responsibility as both prime contractor and systems integrator, it invested hugely in both technical and people development, inspiring confidence in its leadership of a complex network of partners. For example, fully simulating system behaviour considerably reduced the risk of wasting time, or assets, at sea.

Right from the start, a key Thales theme was to connect suppliers to front line naval personnel and operators. Extensive visits to bases and ships built an understanding of real user needs – not just theoretical requirements. This meant the French and British naval teams, Thales, and key suppliers, ECA, L3Harris, Kongsberg, and SAAB, were able to work as one team: full commitment was crucial on a journey with no well-worn paths.

Local facilities were key too. Thales developers’ proximity to end users at its established facility in Brest, France, enabled the delivery of an HMI that was carefully tailored to the needs of naval personnel. Investment in a new UK Autonomy Centre at Turnchapel Wharf, in the UK, paid dividends too. With rapid access to the deep waters of the Plymouth Sound and a local maritime skills base, by 2018, it had attracted universities, laboratories, and marine leaders; it is now becoming a hub to serve other navies as they explore their own unmanned journeys.

Another factor was agility, thoroughly tested in a first phase that saw considerable development of the original concept, something that had to be done in a spirit of co-creation and with maximum flexibility. The agility also became more logistical in a Covid world, with one senior manager observing that having a Plan B became having Plans B, C, D, and E.

The final, and most exciting, challenge in MMCM Phase I was the demonstration of the system of systems in back-to-back, at-sea tests, in Brest, Toulon, and Plymouth, involving a complex set of scenarios and sub-scenarios. Carried out in autumn and early winter, testing was ramped up rapidly from 8-10 hour slots to 24/7 evaluation. The unmanned vehicles covered an equivalent of 30,000 football pitches – demonstrating an outstanding, threefold, increase in MCM productivity, compared with purely conventional approaches. Dozens of mines were detected, in all environmental conditions, and then classified and localised to clear the seas of threats.

Where next for MMCM? For France and the UK: Stage II, for which Thales is already putting in place full-scale production facilities, reinforcing global supply chains, and creating new ecosystem teams.

The opportunity to work with the French and British navies on MMCM’s groundbreaking work has enabled Thales to build deep expertise that can also serve other allied navies. Embracing the unmanned future is an exciting prospect, but it needs sound advice on the most technically viable and economically advantageous options – both full standoff (100% unmanned MCM, operated remotely from a manned mothership or operations centre) or hybrid (a combination of unmanned and manned systems, operated from a vessel at the minefield). MMCM has enabled Thales to develop the vital underpinnings for this, for example by developing a best-of-breed, global supply chain for unmanned MCM, and gaining a clear understanding of make-or-buy decisions.

Thales brings all this learning together in PathMaster, a complete approach designed to help customers cut through the complexity of unmanned mine warfare and explore the solutions that meet their future MCM needs and budgets. The spotlight is now firmly on the unmanned future."

Once installed on the Mars Terrain Simulator, the GTM will navigate over a terrain designed to simulate the Martian environment. These operations are controlled by Thales Alenia Space’s engineers, along with their counterparts from Altec.

The Rover GTM plays a crucial role. It will act as the “Earth twin”, providing operational support for its Martian counterpart from the friendly confines of Earth. All operations to be performed on Mars by the Rosalind Franklin rover will be validated by the GTM on Earth, using identical instruments. It will stay active in the control center to support the actual mission, working with the Thales Alenia Space team that developed it so they can act promptly in critical situations.

The Rosalind Franklin flight model, safely mated to the descent module and protected by its shield, is under test in Thales Alenia Space’s ultra-clean room. Once this phase is completed, it will be transferred to our plant in Rome, where it will undergo several tests in a thermal-vacuum chamber to verify its cleanliness. This operation is designed to drastically reduce any possible organic contamination inside the ALD – a key to meeting the main scientific objective of the mission, namely to determine whether there was ever Life on Mars!

HMS Queen Elizabeth and me: a 20-year relationship - Thales,"Tue, 25 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi91bml0ZWQta2luZ2RvbS9uZXdzL2htcy1xdWVlbi1lbGl6YWJldGgtYW5kLW1lLTIwLXllYXItcmVsYXRpb25zaGlw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"HMS Queen Elizabeth and me: a 20-year relationship Queen Elizabeth Class (QEC) Share this article

To celebrate the deployment of HMS Queen Elizabeth – the jewel in the UK’s Carrier Strike Group – we spoke with Graham Thomson, Type 31 Programme Director at Thales UK.

Our Thales people and capabilities play a key role in the Carrier Strike Group 21 [CSG21] deployment. Our technology features on many of the platforms that make up the Carrier Strike Group from submarines to surface ships to Helicopters and the aircraft carrier itself.

We wanted to find out more about his 20-year relationship with the Royal Navy’s flagship vessel and why this new carrier class is so impressive.

Seeing HMS Queen Elizabeth lead out the Carrier Strike Group on her 26,000 nautical mile maiden deployment must have been quite a moment for you?

It truly was. I’ve had a relationship with the vessel for two decades. I first joined the Thales team competing for the design and build of what was called the Carrier Vessel Future (CVF) as we didn’t know what the name of the ship was going to be yet in 2001. Those first two years were especially exciting as I was part of the Thales-led team of about 30 companies when we created the initial carrier design. We were up against BAE Systems in what we thought was a winner-takes-all bid. As it turned out, Thales won the design competition, but the MoD selected BAE Systems to build it; we moved from competitors to working collaboratively as one team with BAE Systems and other companies almost over-night! Over the next several years the Aircraft Carrier Alliance was formed and the ship’s design was refined and finalised before the award of the manufacturing contract on 2008.

I moved onto several other roles in Thales, before re-joining the Queen Elizabeth Class (QEC) programme, as it was now called, in 2013. Over the next five-and-a-half years I worked alongside my colleagues in the Power and Propulsion team, and more specifically on the Integrated Platform Management System (IPMS).

Can you tell us a bit about the IPMS?

The IPMS controls and monitors most of the ship’s systems and is a key part of the ship’s automation technology. Put simply, it allows a ship as enormous as HMS Queen Elizabeth to operate with far fewer crew members than you might expect. Typically, most carriers have about 30 tonnes of ship per crew member. So the 90,000 plus tonne US carriers have about 3,000 crew, the French flagship carrier, the Charles de Gaulle at 42,500 tonnes has a crew of 1,350. But the Queen Elizabeth class is different. At 65,000 tonnes, you’d expect a crew of 2,000, yet it operates with just 750, so you’ve three times more ship per person than a normal aircraft carrier. By using automation and careful design, we’ve reduced the number of people required to operate the ship by around two thirds. And when you realise that about a third of the whole cost of an aircraft carrier through its life-cycle is the cost of the crew, this is even more impressive.

How does the Queen Elizabeth stack up against other carriers in terms of its size, design and capability?

Extremely well. Displacement-wise, it’s second only to the largest US nuclear-powered carriers so it’s a formidable ship to say the least. The power generation is a combination of gas turbines – derived from the Rolls-Royce Trent aerospace engine – and four large diesel generators, so it has lots of redundancy and robustness. The vessel is capable of a speed in excess of 25 knots and has a range of around 10,000 nautical miles. Its integrated electric propulsion system is unique in the sense that it’s the largest system of its kind installed in any warship to date and effectively turns the vessel into a floating power station.

All the engines on-board generate electricity, which is directed through a power management system to where it's needed to drive the ship and its internal systems including its automated weapons-handling system – which negates the need for dozens and dozens of crew. Plus, the flight deck arrangement and hanger (which can comfortable fit in excess of 3,000 people), allows for a very high sortie-generation rate, so you have a fast turnaround when it comes to re-arming returning aircraft to go out again. In fact, this was a key design requirement.

Perhaps the most obvious innovation I like to point out is the Queen Elizabeth’s ‘twin islands’. These two separate super-structures were designed to use space more efficiently and segregate the different engine systems. The aft island contains the air traffic control, or FLYCO, while the front island has the bridge where the captain commands the ship.

It’s the biggest ship the Royal Navy has ever had and it can operate about 40 aircraft including 36 F35s and Chinook, Apache, Merlin and Wildcat helicopters. All in all, it offers a lot of bang for its buck. This is replicated in the HMS Prince of Wales, the second Queen Elizabeth Class carrier. The reason we have two is for preparedness, so there’s always one combat ready to go when the other returns for maintenance or system upgrades. Essentially, these ships were designed from a clean sheet of paper and represent some of the world’s the most innovative and advanced military sea-faring capabilities.

Do you think the Royal Navy needs a Carrier Strike Group capability?

It's incredibly important for the Royal Navy to be able to deploy its ships in a way that supports ‘our national interests’. From the military-strategic point of view, the UK’s Carrier Strike Group – made up of six destroyers and frigates, an Astute-class submarine in support below the waves, and two Royal Auxiliary support ships – achieves that. It’s the Royal Navy’s largest deployment in more than a decade and allows us to deploy four acres of the UK to anywhere in the world. The CSG’s eight-month tour is one way to show the world that we have a naval capability able to project power and presence and protect the interests of Britain and her allies the world over.

What happens to all that knowledge and experience gained during the development of the QEC over the last 20 or 25 years?

© Crown Copyright

It's a little bit bittersweet, to be honest, because the size and scale of the enterprise required to design, develop and build a warship of this size is certainly not going to happen again in my lifetime. However, I feel very fortunate and privileged to have played a small part in it. I’ve since moved to work on the Type 31, a new general-purpose frigate class progressively coming into service over the next few years. At 140m long, it's half the length of the QEC and just under a tenth of the tonnage at about 6,000 tonnes. A lot of my team members have come from the QEC programme too, and brought that heritage, experience and skills with them.

In many ways, Type 31 extends our development and learning from QEC. Essentially, we’re flowing all of that experience into other programmes. What’s particularly good is that we’ve been able to establish a specialised division inside Thales UK called Above Water Systems, which provides us with the perfect environment to further develop our knowledge, skills and experience for these sorts of programmes.

Anything else you’d like to add?

When I look back on my career, the QEC will always hold a special place in my memory – especially when I joined the ship’s crew of HMS Queen Elizabeth for a month during her initial sea trials. That was a major career highlight and one I’ll never forget.

Thales and RAF to continue information exploitation partnership - Thales,"Tue, 25 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGFsZXNncm91cC5jb20vZW4vY291bnRyaWVzLWV1cm9wZS91bml0ZWQta2luZ2RvbS9uZXdzL3RoYWxlcy1hbmQtcmFmLWNvbnRpbnVlLWluZm9ybWF0aW9uLWV4cGxvaXRhdGlvbi1wYXJ0bmVyc2hpcNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales and RAF to continue information exploitation partnership Royal Air Force Share this article



LinkedIn

The UK Ministry of Defence has confirmed its continuing partnership with Thales to support and develop its primary information management system for air operations.

Information exploitation is crucial to maintaining a competitive edge over potential rivals and the UK MOD’s Intelligence Surveillance Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance Mission Support System (ISTAR MSS) has long been the backbone for Royal Air Force information management. A new, five-year contract signed in April confirms and extends the longstanding relationship between the UK MOD and Thales to provide this capability, under the new name “Multi-Domain Mission Support System” or MD MSS.

MD MSS exemplifies the UK’s investment in transformative and digital capabilities to enable the nation’s Armed Forces to obtain and exploit information at the operating speed of relevance.

Alex Cresswell, CEO and Chairman, Thales in the UK, said:

We are delighted to be continuing our strong relationship with the RAF and we are very proud that MD MSS continues to be the RAF’s mission system of choice for its air platforms. No other MOD digital solution provides the same functionality and information sources, which spans mission planning and intelligence in an end-to-end all-encompassing solution.

The £47 million contract with global defence technology provider Thales assures the system’s availability as well as its evolution to meet future challenges. In addition to repairs and maintenance through a helpdesk facility, a key element of the contract is the spiral development of MD MSS, adding new, user-prioritised capabilities and technologies in agreement with the customer’s lead agency, Defence Equipment and Support (MOD).

Defence Minister Jeremy Quin said:

This £47 million investment will enhance the MD MSS capability and offer further protection across our air and maritime platforms, exploiting data to provide a battle-winning advantage. A prime example of British innovation, this vital technology will support highly skilled jobs in the UK.

Thales began providing operational information technology to the RAF in the 1980s. However, the capability and technology of MD MSS has advanced beyond recognition since it was first developed to manage acoustic information gathered by the Nimrod Maritime Patrol Aircraft. Information is delivered to aircrew and ground-based planners via a flexible architecture, making the system suitable for use on a wide range of air platforms, from the Chinook helicopter to the F-35B Lightning combat aircraft.

Continued investment in MD MSS will serve to enable wider multi-domain integration and drive further joint inter-operability and digital transformation. With the ability to exploit the right data at the right time in a constantly changing operational environment, its agile, interconnected, and data-driven capabilities unlocks the digital potential of information-centric technologies for future force multipliers, such as the Future Combat Air System. In the maritime sphere, MD MSS can also be used onboard the Royal Navy’s new aircraft carriers HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales to support air operations by the Carrier Strike Group.

The latest contract will secure 150 jobs at Thales in the UK. This includes a team of 40 Software Engineers based in the company’s Templecombe facility in Somerset as well as the Field Service Engineers supporting 19 ground locations in the UK and overseas.

“ISTAR MSS has previously been delivered through the Thales product AirScape. To reflect recent changes to the requirement, both the MoD programme and Thales product will now be aligned under the name “Multi-Domain Mission Support System” or MD MSS”

The two companies are participating in the project as subcontractors (50/50) to Lockheed Martin, the prime contractor of the multinational training center and manufacturer of the C-130J Super Hercules transport aircraft.

Awarded in March 2021, the contract will see Rheinmetall and Thales provide personnel and services related to the certification of the training center organization. The qualification is to be completed in 2024, with training operation set to start that same year.

Earlier this year, Lockheed Martin contracted CAE to support the design and development of a suite of C-130J training devices for the training center.

The initial establishment and certification phase may be followed by an optional operating phase. If the operating phase is awarded, Thales and Rheinmetall will provide all management personnel, qualified flight and ground crew instructors as well as maintenance personnel for the operation of all training devices.

The training center is to be established at Évreux in Normandy, home to the French Air Force’s 62nd Transport Squadron, and will host the new French and German C-130J Super Hercules aircraft as a joint transport squadron.

The Franco-German transport aircraft project is one of Europe’s key air force programs. In Évreux, Germany and France intend to jointly operate a total of 10 C-130J Super Hercules aircraft starting this year.

The plan calls for joint cockpit crews as well as mixed teams on the ground. France has already taken delivery of a total of four Super Hercules, whereas Germany will contribute six aircraft to the squadron, with deliveries starting in 2022. These six aircraft will replace the German Transall C-160."

This is something new for us in that we are offering just services. No software, no hardware, just services through the cloud. While we are used to this in our everyday life, it is quite new for aviation. We provide nothing more than a login and a password.”

The TopSky UAS Traffic Management (UTM) service is an unmanned aircraft airspace manager blending air traffic control technologies with national, regional, and local data for drone airspace management, a growing concern globally for both civilian and military aviation.

The second product is TopSky Flow Manager, which predicts air traffic flow. Lerat said: “We can detect when there is an over capacity and suggestion solutions. It can also detect an under capacity and suggest reductions in service provision to save money . It is a resource management tool that predicts air traffic in the future, so operators can organise the number of controllers needed, and have a better use of the workforce. It can also be used by airports to predict use of runways and by airlines to predict the behaviour of their network – whether their flights will arrive on time, and if they will make the connection or not. It is designed to predict a problem, and react in advance.”

For customers the investment is minimal, as the cloud-based service requires no purchase of hardware or software, and no potential clashes with current systems. Lerat said: “It is an add on, so it is not dependent on any infrastructure that the client already has. It is full cloud, so we just need to input the flight plans, through a standard interface, but otherwise we are fully independent of the ATM system. We then provide a login and password, the customer logs in and we configure the data that he requires in his country. We have a global vision, also accessible to the customer, but we provide the information that is relevant to his operation.”

TopSky Flow Manager also brings in the element of collaboration between stakeholders. Lerat explained: “This tool has a chat window for CDM, which is collaboration decision making. This window is designed for people who share the same view to chat and decide which flight they are going to delay and how they are going to modify the situation, so that the problem that is predicted does not occur. Each airline can put forward which airline they would like to be delayed or not, depending on connections.

“Thanks to the cloud we can share the vision of the situation with many stakeholders. You can have thousands of stakeholders all sharing the same vision and communicating with ATCs. The ATC can propose a measure and the airlines can react and have input before the decision is made.

“In Europe we have EuroControl, but in the Middle East we have nothing for international co-ordination and this kind of tool is the start of the first step of EuroControl-like coordination between the nations. I hope it will help to smooth aviation, to protect the environment and make the best use of resources,’ he added.

Thales and Atos create the European champion in big data and artificial intelligence for defence and security - Atos,"Thu, 27 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vYXRvcy5uZXQvZW4vMjAyMS9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlXzIwMjFfMDVfMjcvdGhhbGVzLWFuZC1hdG9zLWNyZWF0ZS1ldXJvcGVhbi1jaGFtcGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris, May 27, 2021,

Atos and Thales announce the creation of Athea, a joint venture that will develop a sovereign big data and artificial intelligence platform for public and private sector players in the defence, intelligence and internal state security communities. Athea will draw on the experience gained by both companies from the demonstration phase of the ARTEMIS programme, the big data platform of the French Ministry of Armed Forces. The contract to optimise and prepare the full-scale roll-out of the ARTEMIS platform was also awarded jointly to the two leaders by the French Defense Procurement Agency on April 30, 2021. The new joint venture will initially serve the French market before addressing European requirements at a later date.

With the exponential rise in the number of sources of information, and increased pressure to respond more quickly to potential issues, State agencies need to manage ever-greater volumes of heterogeneous data and accelerate the development of new AI applications where security and sovereignty are key. Athea will create a solution to securely handle sensitive data on a nationwide scale and support the implementation of that solution within government programmes. The new entity will also provide expert appraisal, consulting, training and other services.

The joint venture will pool the companies’ investments, expertise and experience to respond quickly and efficiently to demand for innovation. Athea will work with an ecosystem of large companies, SMEs, start-ups and research institutes specialising in big data and artificial intelligence. In conjunction with the recently created Defense Digital Agency, the joint entity will also provide secure solutions and open and modular technological building blocks, which encourage collaboration and stimulate the industrial and sovereign ecosystem, in order to support the development of trusted applications.

“This joint venture between Thales and Atos illustrates the commitment of both our companies to supporting the digital transformation of our customers by providing a secure and innovative solution based on French technology to process huge volumes of heterogeneous data. Together, we will capitalise on our respective areas of expertise to provide best-in-class big data and artificial intelligence solutions.” said Marc Darmon, Executive Vice President, Secure Communications and Information Systems, Thales.

“Sensitive data capabilities have become a sovereignty issue for State agencies. By combining the expertise of two major players in defence and digital technologies with the flexibility of a dedicated entity, Athea will generate huge potential for innovation, and stimulate the industrial and defence ecosystem, including innovative start-ups, to meet the needs of government agencies and other stakeholders in the sector. This new joint venture between Atos and Thales is an opportunity to combine a comprehensive understanding of the defence and security issues faced by European States with access to the latest innovations in big data and artificial intelligence.” said Pierre Barnabé, Senior Executive Vice President, Big Data and Cybersecurity, Atos.

Senetas and Thales launch first quantum resistant network encryption solution – Intelligent CIO Africa - Intelligent CIO,"Fri, 14 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludGVsbGlnZW50Y2lvLmNvbS9hZnJpY2EvMjAyMS8wNS8xNC9zZW5ldGFzLWFuZC10aGFsZXMtbGF1bmNoLWZpcnN0LXF1YW50dW0tcmVzaXN0YW50LW5ldHdvcmstZW5jcnlwdGlvbi1zb2x1dGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales and Senetas have collaborated to launch the world’s first quantum resistant network encryption solution, capable of protecting customer data (at speeds up to 100 Gbps) against future quantum attacks.

Regarded the most significant threat to cybersecurity, quantum computing looks set to render many of today’s security methods, such as encryption, obsolete.

With estimates that a working quantum computer outside a lab environment will be a reality within the next five to 10 years, minimum security requirement standards are being developed to protect data in a quantum world.

Andrew Wilson, CEO, Senetas, said: “As quantum computing becomes a reality, organisations around the world should develop a quantum security strategy and start planning to implement quantum resistant encryption sooner rather than later. This is the first to market high-speed network encryption platform that provides quantum resistant encryption with today’s encryption technology. Our government, defence and business customers can make a secure transition to a future quantum-safe world knowing data is protected for the long-term.”. Todd Moore, Vice President, Encryption Solutions, Thales, said: “It’s vital that businesses understand that all of today’s encryption standards are not fit for a quantum world. Hackers know quantum is coming and are actively working to steal data now so they can access it in the future and, large and multi-national organisations are most at risk due to compliance and privacy mandates. Businesses can’t afford to wait, the time is now to review their security quantum strategy.”

Airspace Link raises $10M to make drones safer for both operators and communities - TechCrunch,"Thu, 27 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGNydW5jaC5jb20vMjAyMS8wNS8yNy9haXJzcGFjZS1saW5rLXJhaXNlcy0xMG0tdG8tbWFrZS1kcm9uZXMtc2FmZXItZm9yLWJvdGgtb3BlcmF0b3JzLWFuZC1jb21tdW5pdGllcy_SAXdodHRwczovL3RlY2hjcnVuY2guY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMjcvYWlyc3BhY2UtbGluay1yYWlzZXMtMTBtLXRvLW1ha2UtZHJvbmVzLXNhZmVyLWZvci1ib3RoLW9wZXJhdG9ycy1hbmQtY29tbXVuaXRpZXMvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Airspace Link is today announcing it raised a $10 million Series A from Altos Ventures, Thales and others. The Detroit, Michigan-based startup anticipates using the additional funds to expand its domestic offering and expand overseas.

CEO Michael Healander explains to TechCrunch that the company sees airspaces as digital infrastructure lacking critical regulations. “Today you have rules and regulations on the road,” he says, explaining that the company is building digital roads and management for drones. Airspace Link’s novel platform addresses drone operators’ and communities’ concerns, enabling pilots to safely fly while complying with local airspace restrictions.

Airspace Links offers drone operation planning tools, including API access that allows developers to incorporate Airspace Link’s data into third-party platforms. The company’s system complies with the FAA’s Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability (LAANC), enabling drone pilots to submit operations while flying in controlled airspace. The company is one of seven FAA-approved companies to provide this service.

With the Series A funding, Healander says the goal is to integrate with as many transportation groups as possible.

Founded in 2018 by Michael Healander, Daniel Bradshaw and Ana Healander, the Detroit-based startup employs 20 full-time staff. The company says in a press release that it has partnerships with more than 40 government agencies and municipalities in the United States. Going forward, the company is looking to expand to Australia and Canada.

According to Healander, what distinguishes Airspace Link from the other competitors in the market is its integration with mapping tools used by municipal governments to provide information on ground-based risk.

“Our core purpose is to safely integrate drones into the national airspace and our communities at scale,” said Healander. “We thank Altos Ventures and Thales for joining our vision of paving the way for the drone economy with shared, neutral, and affordable UAS infrastructure.”

For Healander, Airspace Link is only the latest entrepreneurial venture. He previously founded GeoMetri, an indoor GPS tracking company, which was acquired by Acuity Brands.

Altos Ventures led Airspace Link’s Series A round, with participation from Thales, a global leader of air traffic management systems, and previous investors Indicator Ventures,2048 Ventures, Ludlow Ventures, Matchstick Ventures, Techstars and Dan Gilbert’s Detroit Venture Partners (DVP).

“As Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) usage continues to grow, for safe, low altitude operations around communities, airspace management must combine both air and ground insights,” said Todd Donovan, Thales vice president, Airspace Mobility Solutions Americas. “Our deep knowledge of airspace management and Airspace Link’s expertise in geospatial intelligence are the perfect combination to address this complex challenge.”"

Norwegian Defence Materiel Agency (NDMA) deputy director-general rear admiral Bjørge Aase said: “This is a very important milestone in the close military cooperation between Norway and the Netherlands.

“This agreement will provide the Norwegian Armed Forces with a new artillery location system with sufficient protection, mobility, range and accuracy to be able to be used in all types of operations both nationally and internationally.”

GM200 MM/C features Thales’ dual-axis multi-beam 4D active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars.

It is suitable for missions such as counter battery and weapon locating that require high tactical mobility and rapid deployment.

The radar can also support short-range air defence (SHORAD) and very short-range air defence (VSHORAD) missions.

Thales Netherlands CEO Gerben Edelijn said: “This is a historic moment on two levels. Firstly, it reinforces the strong bilateral strategic defence cooperation between Norway and the Netherlands.

“Secondly, this contract represents the first NL MOD G2G support to the Dutch defence industry and in particular Thales. We hope this model is the blueprint for more G2G projects in the future.”"
John Cockerill Defense and Thales present new system combining cannon and rockets integrated into Cockerill 3030 ... - Army Recognition,"Thu, 06 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiyAFodHRwczovL2FybXlyZWNvZ25pdGlvbi5jb20vd2VhcG9uc19kZWZlbmNlX2luZHVzdHJ5X21pbGl0YXJ5X3RlY2hub2xvZ3lfdWsvam9obl9jb2NrZXJpbGxfZGVmZW5zZV9hbmRfdGhhbGVzX3ByZXNlbnRfbmV3X3N5c3RlbV9jb21iaW5pbmdfY2Fubm9uX2FuZF9yb2NrZXRzX2ludGVncmF0ZWRfaW50b19jb2NrZXJpbGxfMzAzMF90dXJyZXQuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"John Cockerill Defense and Thales are combining their skills and product portfolio for the first firing tests of a mixed cannon and 70mm rocket system integrated on a Cockerill 3030 turret.

Follow Army Recognition on Google News at this link



The new system combines the performance of the 30mm cannon from John Cockerill Defense and those of Thales's 70mm guided and unguided rockets (Picture source: John Cockerill Defense/Thales)

Drawing on their respective expertise in turrets and guns for John Cockerill Defense and airborne weapons systems for Thales, the integration of the two systems was completed in less than 6 months. This innovation combines the performance of the 30x173mm cannon from John Cockerill Defense and those of Thales's 70mm guided and unguided rockets. The assembly of the rocket system is carried out on a dedicated support and linked to the full field of use of the turret.

John Cockerill Defense’s Cockerill 3030 turret is fitted with a 30mm Mk44 cannon. Its efficiency is based on a unique rate and precision of fire and offers the most demanding reliability. The turret can hold 255 rounds of 30x173mm in the magazine. In addition, the Cockerill 3030 has the most advanced features such as Hunter-Killer, shooting while rolling and countermeasures at the customer's choice. This turret has already been sold several hundred copies around the world.

Rockets provide an operational complement linked to the flexibility of the use of guided and conventional ammunitions. The laser-guided rocket FZ275 LGR gives metric precision at a range of over 7km, thus limiting collateral damage to a minimum. On the other hand, unguided rockets allow zone saturation or warning fire at a range between 3 and 9 km.

The objective of this new combination is to demonstrate a new capacity on John Cockerill Defense's turrets with rockets (area saturation weapons and pin-point targeting) at a very attractive price compared to missiles and which are in different effectors as well as a version equipped with laser guidance for much higher accuracy of +/- 1m at a range of 6 km, reducing collateral damages. They are an effective alternative to missiles in certain types of ground-to-ground operations. The very long engagement distance (6 km effective range and up to a maximum of 9 km) and the large number of rockets integrated on a turret (2-7-12-19… rockets vs 2 missiles) are also significant advantages. A rocket of this type is not as powerful as a guided anti-tank missile but can destroy more lightly protected mobile vehicles or targets, infrastructure, command posts, large areas or render heavily armored targets inoperative by destroying their external sensors."

Autonomous vessel trials team to support charity swim by Invictus Games veteran - Thales,"Thu, 27 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi91bml0ZWQta2luZ2RvbS9uZXdzL2F1dG9ub21vdXMtdmVzc2VsLXRyaWFscy10ZWFtLXN1cHBvcnQtY2hhcml0eS1zd2ltLWludmljdHVzLWdhbWVzLXZldGVyYW7SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A boat crew which is usually busy testing unmanned surface and underwater vessels will be providing safety cover for a fund-raising swim across Plymouth Sound to support a rehabilitation service for members of the military and emergency services.

Despite losing both legs and one arm in an explosion while serving in Afghanistan, ex-Royal Marine Mark Omrod MBE is set to swim across 1km of open water on Friday morning, 28 May 2021 between Drake Island and Devil’s Point in Plymouth, with a group of supporters.

Safety for Mark’s challenge will be provided by a boat team from Turnchapel Wharf, a former Royal Marines base which is now the country’s leading test centre for surface and underwater unmanned vessels, run by the technology company Thales.

Thales offered the use of one of its rigid inflatable boats (RIB) and a crew of two who are normally busy working on trials for maritime drone technology carried out at Turnchapel Wharf. The crew are qualified boat handlers, trained to deal with emergencies at sea.

Operations manager at Turnchapel Wharf Ryan Collins said: “Our main job will be to keep an eye on the swimmers around Mark and if anyone signals for help, we will react accordingly. Of course, we hope there will be no issues and we’ll be back for a cup of tea and a job well done.”

The technology company Thales established its site in Turnchapel Wharf in 2018 at the cost of £1 million and is the UK leading site for trialling autonomous technology in the maritime environment. The centre also provides a testing resource to marine businesses in the southwest.

Currently, the centre’s staff is working on trials for the Royal Navy’s Maritime Mine Countermeasures programme, developing autonomous craft to seek out and destroy mines at sea without putting sailors’ lives at risk.

Friday’s swim is the latest in a series of challenges that Mark is tackling throughout 2021 to for REORG. The charity helps serving personnel and veterans of the military and emergency services to recover from physical and mental trauma.

Now an athlete, author and motivational speaker, in 2007 Mark was caught in an improvised explosive device blast while on foot patrol in Helmand, suffering injuries so serious they resulted in a triple amputation.

Told he would never walk again, in 2008, just six months after losing his limbs, Mark walked across a Parade Ground to receive his operational medal. Since being medically discharged from the Royal Marines in 2010, he has won 11 medals, including four golds, at the Invictus Games.

One of his gold medals was for the 50m breaststroke. He was also a torchbearer in the run-up to the 2012 London Olympic Games.

David Evans, Customer Services and Support Director for Underwater Systems at Thales and himself a former Royal Marine, will be one of the Thales employees supporting Mark down at the event.

David said: “We are very happy to be able to support both Mark and for the wider community. He is so inspiring and is doing this to raise money for a really great cause and we wish him every success.”

Egypt has recently taken delivery of four units of French-made Thales Ground Master 400 (GM400) AESA air defense radars. These long-range, mobile, 3D radar system has a maximum range of up to 515Km.

Following the emergence of information about the new Rafale deal between Egypt and France, more details recently surfaced indicating that France has taken surety from French banks – BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole, Société Générale and CIC – to finance Rafale jets at €5.4 billion and not €4 billion.

Part of the funds will go into Egyptian acquisition contracts for an observation satellite and two multi-role tanker transport (MRTT) aircraft built by Airbus.

Egypt had initially planned to acquire two satellites in 2016, but settled for only one due to budget issues. The military satellite was worth €600 million. In 2020, Egypt entered negotiations with Italy for a surveillance satellite as part of a much larger package that included four frigates, 20 corvettes based on the Falaj class that Fincantieri built for the United Arab Emirates, 24 Eurofighter Typhoon multirole jets, 24 M346 jet trainers.

The business failed to materialise due to Cairo’s strained diplomatic relations with Rome following the murder of an Italian doctoral student Giulio Regeni in February 2016 in the suburbs of Cairo.

According to Thales, the Ground Master 3D air surveillance radar, provides C2 centres with superior situational awareness at all times. With an update rate of 6 seconds and an elevation coverage of up to 40°, it can continuously scan the airspace simultaneously detecting all types of high, medium and low altitude targets.

IT consulting firm Atos has partnered with technology company Thales to launch a joint venture that will develop a new big data and artificial intelligence platform. Athea will serve public and private sector players in the defence sector.

Mounting pressures on the resources of security services, coupled with advances in supporting technology such as 5G, are currently seeing organisations’ appetites for tech-driven security systems explode. In this context, consultancy Atos has landed a succession of roles helping public and private clients leverage innovation for their defence and security offerings.

Now, Atos has announced a new venture in partnership with innovation firm Thales, which will see it produce a sovereign big data and artificial intelligence offering. Sensitive data capabilities have become a sovereignty issue for State agencies. By combining the expertise of two major players in defence and digital technologies with the flexibility of a dedicated entity, the Athea programme will help public and private sector operators in the defence, intelligence and internal state security communities.

“This joint venture between Thales and Atos illustrates the commitment of both our companies to supporting the digital transformation of our customers by providing a secure and innovative solution based on French technology to process huge volumes of heterogeneous data. Together, we will capitalise on our respective areas of expertise to provide best-in-class big data and artificial intelligence solutions,” said Marc Darmon, Executive Vice President, Secure Communications and Information Systems, Thales.

The joint venture will pool the companies’ investments, expertise and experience to respond quickly and efficiently to demand for innovation. Athea will work with an ecosystem of large companies, SMEs, start-ups and research institutes specialising in big data and artificial intelligence. In conjunction with the recently created Defense Digital Agency, the joint entity will also provide secure solutions and open and modular technological building blocks, which encourage collaboration and stimulate the industrial and sovereign ecosystem, in order to support the development of trusted applications.

Pierre Barnabé, Senior Executive Vice President, Big Data and Cybersecurity, Atos, added, “Athea will generate huge potential for innovation, and stimulate the industrial and defence ecosystem, including innovative start-ups, to meet the needs of government agencies and other stakeholders in the sector. This new joint venture between Atos and Thales is an opportunity to combine a comprehensive understanding of the defence and security issues faced by European States with access to the latest innovations in big data and artificial intelligence.”

The move also draws on the experience gained by both companies from the demonstration phase of the ARTEMIS programme, the big data platform of the French Ministry of Armed Forces. The contract to optimise and prepare the full-scale roll-out of the ARTEMIS platform was also awarded jointly to the two leaders by the French Defense Procurement Agency at the end of April 2021. The new Athea joint venture will therefore initially serve the French market before addressing European requirements at a later date.

Elsewhere, Atos recently acquired Ipsotek. The AI enhanced software provider will enable the consultancy to enter the world of video analytics. Founded in 2001, the London based firm offers clients an innovative platform, which leverages artificial intelligence permitting users to efficiently manage automatically-generated alerts in real-time."

More than 1,200 hours already are booked on the simulator by various operators in the helicopter EMS, oil-and-gas and law enforcement sectors, according to Trapp. Most of those customers are based in the U.S. and Canada. Others are from Mexico, Chile, Peru and Brazil, Jean-Charles de Troy, managing director of Helisim, told Vertical. The first trainee is scheduled to being in June.

“With this new training center, Helisim is able to offer the best simulator-based training to H145 operators,” de Troy said. “With outstanding equipment and software implemented, including an OEM simulator data package, along with integrating Airbus helicopter flight instructors, our goal is to offer a reliable and true-to-mission training experience to H145 pilots.”

Equipped with the OEM data package, the simulator provides the most true-to-life experience with the safety benefits of simulation, allowing instructors to train operators to react safely and efficiently to a wide variety of real-world situations.

“I was really, really impressed with how real the simulator is,” Trapp said of his experience flying it. “Usually when you go in a simulator, you know you are not in a real environment. The technology of this simulator makes you really feel you are in a helicopter and flying.”

The 18,500-square-foot Helisim Simulation Center was designed to house two simulator bays, with the room for expansion to three simulators in the future, as needed. The training center also operates an H125/AS350 full-flight simulator and an EC135/EC145 flight training device.

The simulator is set up to train pilots on the four-blade version of the H145 because that configuration is what the majority of operators fly. When the five-blade version of the aircraft overtakes the four-blade variant on the market, the simulator will be upgraded to train pilots on the five-blade version, de Troy said.

The new simulator represents a major international expansion of France-based Helisim, a joint venture of Airbus Helicopters, Thales, and DCI. Airbus trains about 1,500 pilots and technicians at its Grand Prairie facility each year, Trapp said. The simulator is Airbus Helicopters’ second H145 full flight simulator. The other is at Airbus headquarters in Germany.

The U.S. Army has purchased 18 H145s and will send some of its pilots to Grand Prairie for simulator training."

Thales Australia has conducted a safe test firing of a rocket powered by the locally designed and manufactured ‘Jones’ motor, as part of a broader program aimed at enhancing sovereign guided weapons capability by evaluating local rocket motor nozzle technologies.

The Jones rocket motor, manufactured at the Thales-managed Australia Munitions’ site in Mulwala, NSW, was co-designed by Southern Launch, an Australian SME providing launch services and bespoke rocket subsystems.

============== ==============

Southern Launch also hosted the test flight at its Koonibba Test Range, Australia’s first licensed launch site for overland suborbital rocket testing.

Dion Habner, managing director of Australia Munitions, said the rocket motor firing was a “core risk mitigation step” in a broader program to enhance the nation’s capacity to develop guided weapons technology.

“This represents a critical milestone in the return to routine rocket motor manufacturing at the Mulwala Munitions facility,” Habner said.

“In the late 1990s, advanced warhead and rocket motor facilities were established at Mulwala and since then advanced warheads, military rocket motors and ignition systems have been safely manufactured on site.

“Every day, high explosives and propellants are produced for systems used by Australian and allied forces, including the explosive effectors for GBU-12 aerial laser-guided bombs.”

He added: “Testing activities are a routine part of operations in Australia’s sovereign munition manufacturing facility at Mulwala.”

Earlier this year, Thales revealed that Australian Munitions exported a record $30 million in orders to the US, New Zealand, Canada, Asia and Europe over the course of 2020.

The orders included the sale of munitions, propellant, military explosives and sporting shooter munitions, produced in Australian Munitions’ facilities in Benalla, Victoria, and Mulwala.

The milestone came despite COVID-induced disruptions to the supply chain, which according to Thales, demonstrates the “superiority of Australia’s sovereign munitions product”.

Building on Thales’s 10-year sovereign Strategic Domestic Munitions Manufacturing (SDMM) contract recently announced by Australian Government, the new partnership will support technology transfer to Australia for the design, development, manufacture and sustainment of a variety of critical munitions products.

Thales’s partnership with General Dynamics – OTS is built on substantial work already achieved including most recently BLU-126 and BLU-111 aerial ordnance as well as undertaking the capability establishment of 155mm M795 HE projectiles as witnessed by US Embassy visit to the Mulwala and Benalla facilities in February 20211. This work is driving significant growth in Australia’s sovereign capability, boosting investment in SMEs, manufacturing and delivering long term jobs.

Increasing industrial capability will build Australia’s self-reliance and the capability of the broader Australian advanced manufacturing sector, which is vital to delivering a capability advantage to the Australian Defence Force.

For more than 30 years Thales Australia has built a national industrial ecosystem to support the delivery of capability to the Australian Defence Force. This demonstrates that maximising technology transfer to Australia on major Defence projects is a significant driver of growth in Australia’s sovereign industrial capability.

Thales Australia’s recent supply chain analysis with AlphaBeta Advisors demonstrated that there is a substantial economic benefit from domestic defence spending, delivering thousands of jobs through hundreds of businesses across the nation. In 2019 alone, Thales Australia spent $522 million with 1,362 Australian firms, 70 percent of which were SMEs."

French Navy's Defence and Intervention Frigate

The first of five new digital radars for France's future Defence and Intervention frigate (Frégate de Défense et d’Intervention) have been delivered to the French Navy.

Designed to help future naval vessels combat air, surface and asymmetric threats, the Sea Fire's solid-state four-panel Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) antennae can search for air and surface targets simultaneously, scanning an area of several hundred square kilometres with 360° coverage in azimuth, 90° in elevation and an unmatched refresh rate.

“Drawing on more than 70 years of Thales experience in the field of surface radars, the Sea Fire is designed to help navies to counter all types of threats, from slow-moving targets to supersonic missiles,” said Rémi Mongabure, Bids Director for multifunction radars at Thales.

Mongabure says Sea Fire brings modern frigates the same power and performance as a destroyer and ensures that commanders can fulfil their mission with optimum safety.

Sea Fire benefits from Thales's Big Data and cybersecurity expertise. The huge volumes of data generated by each panel — in the order of one terabit per second — can be processed using advanced algorithms to optimise the radar’s performance in specific operating environments. Thales says the new AESA fixed-array radar offers twice the operational availability of earlier-generation radar systems with mechanically scanned antennas.

Manufactured in Limours, south of Paris, with the involvement of a French network of small medium- sized companies, the Sea Fire started production in May 2018 and successfully passed initial qualification tests in late 2020, despite difficulties caused by the Covid-19 crisis.



The radars will be integrated on the new frigates at the Lorient shipyard where they are being constructed.

THALES | Business Wire - Via Ritzau,"Tue, 18 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vdmlhLnJpdHphdS5kay9wcmVzc2VtZWRkZWxlbHNlLzEzNjIyMjM1L3RoYWxlcz9wdWJsaXNoZXJJZD05MDQ1NtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales today announced new data protection solutions for Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services, solidifying its role as a trusted third party for multicloud data security.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210518005282/en/

With each cloud provider having unique data protection mechanisms and key management offerings, multicloud data protection presents a complex security challenge for organisations. Thales’ latest cloud data security solutions allow customers to maintain control of and manage their encryption keys, as well as manage access and authentication across hybrid and multicloud environments.

“These capabilities are critical to cloud migration and security, especially with such accelerated growth in this area,” said Sunil Potti, Vice President and General Manager of Google Cloud Security . “True to our mission, we have forged this collaboration with Thales to further protect our customer’s most sensitive information. We are empowering customers to leverage the full potential of Google Cloud technology for sensitive workloads, by utilising the Customer-Managed Encryption Key-integrated GCP services, CipherTrust Cloud Key Manager and SafeNet Trusted Access for access management and authentication from Thales. This will enable enterprises to deal with a fluid and dynamic business environment where protecting sensitive data in the cloud is of extreme importance.”

Simplifying Multicloud Security

As customers look to reap the rewards from multicloud environments, Thales is making it easier to ensure protection against reputational risk and financial penalties arising from a cloud data breach. As such, customers will benefit from enhanced capabilities to Discover, Protect and Control sensitive data across multicloud environments, including the ability to:

Discover Sensitive Data in the Cloud and On-Premises

Thales Data Discovery and Classification automates the discovery, classification and protection of data in the cloud and on-premises using automation policies that identify sensitive data and protect the data with encryption or tokenisation. These capabilities have now been extended to the discovery and classification of data in Amazon Web Services S3 buckets and Azure Blob storage.

Protect Sensitive Data and Workloads in the Cloud

To address both the complexity of where data is stored and to help ensure data sovereignty in a multicloud environment, effective encryption and tokenisation is needed. Specific new data protection capabilities for cloud platforms include:

CipherTrust Transparent Encryption for advanced encryption and access controls, protects data in Amazon Web Services Simple Storage Service (S3)

Encryption of Kubernetes secrets and Google Anthos Service Mesh signing keys

Control Access to Applications and Sensitive Data in the Cloud

The accelerated adoption of encryption has led to the need to manage a far larger number of encryption keys across both traditional data stores and multicloud environments. Thales has enabled new capabilities that allow organisations to control access to data and ownership of their encryption keys, including:

Thales is also offering CipherTrust Cloud Key Manager support for Google Cloud’s External Key Manager (EKM), building on the existing CipherTrust Key Broker for Google Cloud EKM which is part of the Thales Data Protection on Demand cloud-based platform.

Secure and Protect access at the Login Point

Compromised identities pose one of the greatest risks for data breaches:

SafeNet Trusted Access integrates out of the box with Google Workspace, Azure and AWS, enforcing the appropriate access controls and authentication for privileged and regular users.

SafeNet Trusted Access is offering new abilities to provide authentication and authorisation for APIs and for applications not using industry-standard protocols such as SAML and OIDC.

“The proliferation of multicloud computing has created new organizational challenges in managing data across many different cloud environments. Whilst organisations have benefited from scalability and speed to market thanks to the power of cloud, the ever expanding IT cloud landscape has added greater complexity to data management and security,” said Sébastien Cano, Senior Vice President, Cloud Protection and Licensing activities at Thales . “In a post pandemic, highly regulated world, it is even more important for organisations to understand what data they have, where it sits, who can access it and the risks associated with managing it. Only once an organization understands all of these data lifecycle aspects, can they ensure that it is secured and managed correctly.”

Creating software to keep naval systems always-on – Bits&Chips - Bits&Chips,"Thu, 27 May 2021 07:11:16 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vYml0cy1jaGlwcy5ubC9hcnRpa2VsL2NyZWF0aW5nLXNvZnR3YXJlLXRvLWtlZXAtbmF2YWwtc3lzdGVtcy1hbHdheXMtb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Nieke Roos

Imagine a system that, once turned on, will stay on for the rest of its life. Neither hardware failures nor code glitches can bring it down. At Thales, chief software architect René van Hees is putting his shoulders to the wheel to make this dream a reality.

“Companies like Tesla have set a new standard in software development. With a mere update over the air, they’re able to cut 6 meters off their cars’ braking distance at 100 km/h. That’s really something – we’re talking about millions of vehicles that have to remain safe to drive,” says René van Hees from Thales. “Who’d have thought five years ago that we’d be changing the functionality of our critical systems on the fly?”

Chief software architect Van Hees is pushing hard to adopt a similar approach for naval systems. “We’re becoming much more software-intensive as well, with software playing an increasingly important role in our radars. New features are more and more enabled by software, while the hardware remains more or less the same. We’re heading towards a future where, once we’ve deployed a system on a ship, we’ll be adding functionality exclusively through software updates.”

Design for change

To get to that future, there are still some choppy waters to navigate. “For one, it means that we need to drastically increase the frequency with which we deploy new software versions to our systems in the field,” clarifies Van Hees. “Instead of doing a big bang every six months or so, we need to move to very frequent, very small, very local updates. Within our software development department, we’re already integrating continuously, ie adding new features to our software baseline every day. We’re looking to roll this out to the system level and eventually to the customer.”

The main challenge is to keep the systems qualified at all times. After a system has passed all operational tests, customers tend to become very wary of even the smallest modifications. Which is perfectly understandable considering that some of the radars are critically connected to heavy weaponry. So, at the very least, Thales needs to be able to give the absolute guarantee that adding a new feature will allow operations to continue. Van Hees: “Such a task is far from trivial for software that’s so dependent on hardware. Design for change is key.”

The software engineering team in Hengelo is exploring several means to this end. “We’re looking into the communication between the different software components,” gives Van Hees as an example. “If we update one such component and one of its interfaces changes as a result, this might affect the components on the other side of that interface, in turn affecting the components they’re talking to, and so on. One little modification could thus cause a tidal wave flooding the system. Building on the Comma framework developed in collaboration with Philips and TNO-ESI, we’re working on ways to keep the changes local.”

Another research project addresses the security considerations of software updates in the field. “Wherever the system is, we need to make sure that it only gets the updates we want it to,” explains Van Hees. “We’re exploring ways to enable the system to verify that Thales is indeed the source and if so, to automatically and securely install the new software version while remaining operational and qualified.”

Credit: Thales

Software flexibility

All these efforts, and more, come together in Van Hees’ BHAG, big hairy audacious goal – building systems that are always-on. “My vision is to have a system that, once turned on, will stay on for the rest of its life. Hardware parts may break or go obsolete, software components may crash or be corrupted – nothing can bring it down. To get there, however, we have our work cut out for us. It has all kinds of ramifications, for software development as well as system design.”

Hardware is bound to go obsolete, for example, so at some point, a new processing board or module would have to be put in. “Since the system is always-on, I’d need to add the hardware at run time,” Van Hees points out. “It’s then up to the software architecture to manage this and keep the system up and running.”

The system also needs to be prepared for new features and the associated added complexity – like the Tesla update reducing the car’s braking distance. Van Hees: “I could deal with that by expanding the hardware, but I could also be more flexible in the software I’m running on my existing hardware. Based on the circumstances, I could redistribute my processing power from features that are less essential at a given moment to functionality that’s critical. Maybe I don’t need to be able to see 2,000 kilometers all the time and, for a short period, 150 kilometers is far enough. During that specific window, I could then allocate more resources to more demanding tasks.”

The same mechanism could be used to fence off cyberattacks, Van Hees goes on to philosophize. “For this to work, my security would need to be completely implemented in software, though, which isn’t yet the case. Periodic updates, design for change and software-defined security all presume that I can reason about my solution and, moreover, coordinate the required changes.”

Opening up

This vision of always-on systems, together with the software strategy to get there, is one of three pillars supporting Van Hees’ work as a chief software architect at Thales. “But I’m going nowhere without skilled people,” he notes, introducing the second pillar. “As good software architects are extremely hard to get by, we’ve decided to train them ourselves. With Luminis, we’ve set up the Accelerate program: in 18 months, select mid-level software engineers have both their technical and human skills cranked up to senior level. This pressure cooker is expected to deliver its first batch of twelve technical leaders come November.”

Van Hees’ third pillar is collaboration. “We simply can’t do everything ourselves so we need to work together. Collaboration in education, as illustrated by our Accelerate partnership with Luminis, which was born out of a mutual need for senior people – I’d like nothing more than to open up the program to other companies. But also, collaboration in sharing knowledge and technology. Take Inaetics for example, our dynamic, service-oriented software architecture. It was developed in a publicly funded consortium. We’re now looking to forge similar partnerships with companies to open-source it and broaden its application where feasible.”

“Our systems no longer operate on their own,” Van Hees concludes. “As the world around them is growing more complex, so are they. The move to systems that are always-on only adds to the complexity. Keeping them resilient, also over time, is our main challenge.”"

Thales Australia and General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems (OTS) confirmed that the pair have entered into a new agreement to enhance Thales’ munitions capabilities, as part of Australia’s growing sovereign defence manufacturing and procurement strategy.

Thales confirmed that the recent agreement will form part of the company’s Strategic Domestic Munitions Manufacturing (SDMM) contract with the government, which is expected to last for a decade.

============== ==============

The pair have already undertaken work across a range of ordnances and munitions together, including the BLU-126, BLU-111 and 155mm M795 HE projectiles. The latter projectile was recently viewed by the US embassy during their February visit to Thales’ Mulwala and Benalla sites.

Thales Australia recently partnered with AlphaBeta Advisors to conduct an analysis on the defence market in Australia, and found that the industry employs thousands of workers throughout Australia – with Thales Australia specifically investing $522 million to 1,362 Australian companies in 2019 collaborative projects, 70 per cent of which were SMEs.

The agreement comes following the recent announcement by Lockheed Martin Australia and Thales Australia for the production of the Lockheed Martin Long Range Anti-Ship Missile - Surface Launch (LRASM SL) variant.

Regarding the agreement with Lockheed Martin, chief executive of Thales Australia Chris Jenkins outlined that it demonstrated the company's ongoing support for Australia's defence industry.

“High performance propellants and explosives for warheads, solid fuel rocket motor manufacturing and associated R&D and support services delivered by Thales Australia are essential to achieve sovereign guided weapons capability and we are looking forward to working with Lockheed Martin in support of the Australian Defence Force’s objectives,” Jenkins said.

According to a statement, Thales Australia outlined that the recent commonwealth government policies to bolster Australia’s sovereign defence manufacturing capability will create a stronger defence and manufacturing sector in Australia.

Denmark's ETCS rollout progresses - International Railway Journal,"Fri, 07 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWxqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9zaWduYWxsaW5nL2Rlbm1hcmtzLWV0Y3Mtcm9sbG91dC1wcm9ncmVzc2VzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"BANEDANMARK has successfully commissioned ETCS Level 2 Baseline 3 on the Langå - Struer - Holsterbro line in western Denmark, the fourth line on the national network to switch to the new signalling system as part of the nationwide rollout, which the infrastructure manager is overseeing.

Thales delivered ETCS and its Aramis traffic management system under a contract it is delivering with Strukton (previously Balfour Beatty) for the west of the country, covering approximately 1200km of lines.

ETCS was activated on the line in five stages: Hvidbjerg - Struer, Hjerm - Vinderup, Vinderup - Højslev, Højslev - Viborg, and Viborg - Langå.

Langå - Struer - Holsterbro is the third line under the west contract to become operational following Lindholm - Frederikshavn in October 2018 and Thisted - Struer in April 2020. The Roskilde - Køge line delivered under the east contract with Alstom entered operation in November 2019. Activation of ETCS is expected on the Køge - Næstved section in August.

Banedanmark also expects to activate ETCS on the line from Mogenstrup in South Zealand to Rødby on Lolland in December. This work is being undertaken as part of the upgrades to the Ringsted - Fehmarn line.

In addition, Banedanmark says that by the end of 2021 more than 150 trains will be equipped with onboard ETCS equipment. Alstom is supplying its Atlas system for 789 rail vehicles under a contract awarded in March 2012.

Copenhagen S-Bane

Denmark’s national signalling renewal programme also includes installation of CBTC on the 170km Copenhagen S-Bane network delivered by Siemens under a contract awarded in 2011. Following three months of trial operation, a normal timetable resumed on the Farum Line at the end of April, taking the total CBTC rollout to 45% of the network.

Banedanmark says that on the sections of line where CBTC is active the number of signalling errors have halved compared with the legacy analogue system from the 1960s, increasing train punctuality.

The full rollout of CBTC across the S-Bane network is expected by the end of 2022. A feasibility study is also underway to explore an upgrade of CBTC to ATO at GoA 4.

The rollout of ETCS across the Danish mainline network was approved in 2009, and was originally scheduled to be completed in 2023. This target was pushed back to 2030 by the government in November 2017, when it became clear that plans for the project were overambitious. Reasons cited included an overestimation of timescales to develop, test and stabilise the system, and an overambitious budget projection.

The project’s budget was originally set at DKr 24.9bn ($US 4bn) but was reduced to DKr 4.5bn in 2011-12 after Banedanmark received unexpectedly low contract offers. However, as the project as continued, subsequent budget revisions have returned to levels anticipated in the original business case."
DE&S awards contract to deliver high-tech data system for RAF and Royal Navy - Defence Equipment & Support,"Tue, 25 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vZGVzLm1vZC51ay80Ny1taWxsaW9uLWRhdGEtc3lzdGVtLXJhZi1uYXZ5LXRoYWxlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A high-tech data system providing UK defence platforms with key operational information and improved situational awareness has received a £47-million spending boost. DE&S has awarded the new five-year support contract to Thales for the Multi Domain Mission Support System (MD MSS). Both the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy use MD MSS to exploit operational information, which is crucial to dominating the battlespace. The new contract will deliver full capability support, obsolescence management and a new online training solution. Around 150 jobs will be secured at Thales in the UK, including a team of 40 software engineers at the company’s Templecombe facility in Somerset. Defence Minister Jeremy Quin said: “This £47-million investment will enhance the MD MSS capability and offer further protection across our air and maritime platforms, exploiting data to provide a battle-winning advantage.”

“ The competition reaffirms our dedication to invest in shipbuilding and support jobs across the UK maritime industry.”

As set out in DE&S’ new strategy, we will use capabilities such as MD MSS to ‘build a modernised defence which enables the UK’s Armed Forces to outpace our adversaries and retain their adaptive edge’. MD MSS delivers critical information, at speed, to aircrew and ground-based planners. It is used by a wide variety of force elements in different operational situations. For the RAF, this includes F-35B Lightning II, Poseidon, Typhoon, Voyager and Chinook among others. In the maritime sphere, MD MSS can also be used onboard the Royal Navy’s new aircraft carriers, HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales, to support air operations by the Carrier Strike Group. MD MSS also has the potential to be used by the UK’s next generation platforms including the Future Combat Air System. DE&S Director Air Support Richard Murray said: “The signing of this support contract represents an important milestone for data sharing capability across the UK’s air and maritime platforms. It’s also the culmination of many months of hard work from the Air Platform Systems team and I am proud of their efforts.”"

Why did you get involved in the Manor Royal BID?

Advertisement Hide Ad

Advertisement Hide Ad

Businesses generally can get a bit siloed. To some extent that is natural as they are busy and have their own objectives and interests.

When I came to Manor Royal it was clear to me that this approach wasn’t working. There was a need to bring businesses together to help solve some of the issues we were facing back then, and we could not do that be continuing to work alone.

A group of Manor Royal businesses keen on making a difference came together and I felt it was something we should be part of.

Businesses, including Thales, took a leap of faith and voted to create the BID in 2013. That was a big moment leading to the creation of the UK’s largest “industrial” BID. Ever since, the BID has been paying back that faith.

So, it was about networking and partnership?

Advertisement Hide Ad

Advertisement Hide Ad

Yes and no. I was very clear from the start that while the “tea and biscuit” meetings were all very nice, I wanted to be part of something that could make change happen.

Through the BID we have been able to create solid alliances with key partners – like the Councils – and delivered improved facilities, better broadband, new signage, introduced additional maintenance and security services and much more – on top of helping businesses to be better connected.

How has COVID impacted local businesses?

Almost every business has had to adapt, some more than others. There is still some nervousness around and until confidence returns and grows there will still be challenges. I have been immensely impressed at how agile and adaptable different businesses have been.

On a very practical level businesses are looking at their cost base more than ever, particularly in terms of their premises if people aren’t coming into the office as much as they used to.

Will Manor Royal be ok?

Advertisement Hide Ad

Taking a longer view what made Manor Royal attractive before the pandemic still holds: great location, well-connected, close to an airport and a dynamic community of almost 700 business supported by an increasingly influential and ambitious BID Company.

We must still be sensible, but I sense a growing “let’s just get on with it” spirit emerging and it’s that kind of attitude matched with the new investment coming into Manor Royal that gives me cause for feeling quietly optimistic about our future. I think we will be ok."
Belfast-built missile system onboard Royal Navy flagship - Shropshire Star,"Sun, 23 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNocm9wc2hpcmVzdGFyLmNvbS9uZXdzL3VrLW5ld3MvMjAyMS8wNS8yMy9iZWxmYXN0LWJ1aWx0LW1pc3NpbGUtc3lzdGVtLW9uYm9hcmQtcm95YWwtbmF2eS1mbGFnc2hpcC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A team of Belfast employees have celebrated their contribution to the Royal Navy’s latest flagship vessel after the £3 billion aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth set sail.

Workers at the Thales site in the Northern Irish capital designed and manufactured one of the key assets protecting the new 65,000-tonne vessel – a missile system on the Navy’s Wildcat helicopter.

The lightweight multi-role missile (LMM) – referred to as Martlet by the Navy – has recently entered service at sea after completing live-firing trials with Wildcat manufacturer Leonardo.

It is already in service with other land-based UK armed forces and in the Middle East and Asia.

(Thales/PA)

At sea, LMM has been designed to defend against smaller, fast-moving targets or neutralising precision targets on board a ship.

HMS Queen Elizabeth also boasts contributions from a number of other Thales sites across the UK.

The vessel will be protected by an Astute Class submarine, which has been kitted out with an optronic mast – a sophisticated sensor which has replaced the traditional submarine periscope – manufactured in Glasgow, and Thales Sonar 2076 from Somerset and Manchester.

Belfast site managing director Philip McBride said the departure of the HMS Queen Elizabeth was a “massively proud moment for all employees”.

“We normally take a quiet pride in what we do and get on with the job, but this is a very high-profile, global event and so we should celebrate success,” he said.

“The key to the development of the LMM system and the other portfolio of capabilities we design, manufacture and integrate at Belfast is our significant talent pool of skills and experience established over many years.”

The Belfast site employs more than 500 people in highly skilled jobs in defence and space solutions and technologies.

Mr McBride added: “We also have a very strong supply chain in Northern Ireland, where we work collaboratively and use their expertise and ability to work in an agile and flexible manner.

“This is critical to how we operate today and in the future.

“Northern Ireland has already had a strong reputation for its engineering pedigree and I think being part of Carrier Strike Group 21 is the latest chapter in that story.

“It’s an exciting time for us as we continue to deliver the growth strategy for our business in Belfast and our local supply chain.”

Thales is a founding member of the Aircraft Carrier Alliance, along with Babcock, BAE and the Ministry of Defence, which built HMS Queen Elizabeth and sister ship HMS Prince of Wales.

Thales also supplied the state-of-the-art communications system, the long-range radar and led the power and propulsion sub alliance."

The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said it was also ready for trial, with its first witness in the matter being Public Works and Infrastructure Minister Patricia de Lille.

De Lille blew the whistle on the multi-billion rand arms deal almost 22 years ago.

NPA spokesman Sipho Ngwema said they had done all the necessary preparations and all its 217 witnesses were ready to testify.

Advocate Masuku said Zuma had always been ready to proceed with the trial.

In April, Mabuza Attorneys submitted a notice of withdrawal to the high court informing it they would no longer represent Zuma in the matter.

This was just weeks before the long-anticipated start of the trial related to the 1999 strategic defence acquisition, popularly known as the arms deal.

Among the allegations is that the former president received an annual kickback of R500 000 – paid through his then financial advisor Schabir Shaik – in exchange for shielding Thales from an investigation into the deal and he is said to have accepted a total of 783 dodgy payments from the company.

In June 2005, the High Court in Durban found Shaik guilty of corruption and sentenced him to more than 15 years in jail. However, he was later released on medical parole in March 2009.

French Naval Group new offer to the Hellenic Navy - GreekCityTimes.com,"Sat, 29 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vZ3JlZWtjaXR5dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjEvMDUvMjkvZnJlbmNoLW5hdmFsLWdyb3VwLW5ldy1vZmZlci10by10aGUtaGVsbGVuaWMtbmF2eS_SAVxodHRwczovL2dyZWVrY2l0eXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDIxLzA1LzI5L2ZyZW5jaC1uYXZhbC1ncm91cC1uZXctb2ZmZXItdG8tdGhlLWhlbGxlbmljLW5hdnkvP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Naval Group submitted as part of the French Team with MBDA and Thales a new offer for the modernization of the surface fleet of the Hellenic Navy. The French Team’s offer includes 4 FDI HN (3 built-in Greece and the 1st in service by 2025 along with a Gap filler solution of 2 frigates available in early 2022), the modernization of the MEKO frigates in Greece, and a Hellenic Industry Participation (HIP).

Fitted with up to 32 ASTER missiles or with a combination of ASTER and MICA NG missiles, 21 RAM, 8 Exocet MM 40 B 3, MU 90 lightweight torpedoes and 76 mm gun, she offers capabilities for the permanent control of air and sea space and autonomy of action, in support of the political and military objectives set. The FDI HN will be fully interoperable with NATO and EU Navies’ fleets. She will be capable of assuming all multimission roles within any kind of allied fleet and within the HN fleet.

The Aster missiles onboard can be engaged very quickly in all directions and ensure an unmatched hit-to-kill capability, making it possible to defeat saturating attacks.

The first FDI HN (Belharra) will be delivered in 2025 meaning that the needs of the HN will be addressed very quickly and Naval Group offers a risk-free solution for the construction of the 3 other FDI HN in Greece, by Greek shipyards, on time, and with the same quality and performances as the first of class.

In addition, the French offer includes a Gap filler solution, also available in the shortest timeframe since the 2 Anti-air warfare (AAW) and Anti-submarine Warfare (ASW) frigates will be delivered to Greece in 2022 within the frame of the proposal.

Naval Group, Thales and MBDA have formed a partnership that offers a solution for the upgrade of the MEKO.

The MEKO mid-life refit program is planned to be carried out in Greece. In this respect, Thales can count on the presence of Thales Hellas S.A. and on the relations already established between Thales and Naval Group with existing industrial partners.

Naval Group’s experts have been working in coordination with the two main defense industry associations, SEKPY and HASDIG, but also with the maritime industry association HEMEXPO.

More than 70 companies based in Athens and Thessaloniki areas have been identified among which 10 companies are already pre-qualified and 40 have been met and/or visited for a preliminary evaluation of their industrial capabilities.

Naval Group is already working on cybersecurity applied to the naval and maritime domains with Greek partners in the frame of different European programs such as CYBERMAR as well as the PESCO Pandora and H2020 projects.

The Belharra frigate will have a length of 122 m, a beam of 17.7 m, and a displacement of 4,460 tons. The ship will have a crew of 110 people as well as an aircrew detachment of approximately 15 people. She will also have a flight deck and one hangar to accommodate one unmanned VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) aircraft or one NH-90 naval helicopter."
