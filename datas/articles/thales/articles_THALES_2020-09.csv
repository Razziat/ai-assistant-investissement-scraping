"ASECNA, Thales provide African early SBAS open service - GPS World magazine","Mon, 21 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdwc3dvcmxkLmNvbS9hc2VjbmEtdGhhbGVzLXByb3ZpZGUtYWZyaWNhbi1lYXJseS1zYmFzLW9wZW4tc2VydmljZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Service opens a new era of satellite navigation performance augmentation in the Africa and Indian Ocean Region

The Agency for Air Navigation Safety in Africa and Madagascar (ASECNA) has started to broadcast a satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS) signal over Africa and the Indian Ocean (AFI) region.

This is the first SBAS open service in this part of the world, according to Thales Alenia Space. The signal is broadcast via the NIGCOMSAT-1R satellite managed and operated by Nigerian Communications Satellite Ltd. under the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy of Nigeria.

The early open service is provided as part of the “SBAS for Africa & Indian Ocean” program, which pursues the autonomous provision over the continent of SBAS services to augment the performances of the satellite navigation constellations GPS and Galileo.

With improved accuracy to within a meter — and boosted integrity, availability and continuity of safety-related applications — the SBAS services will improve flight safety and efficiency in Africa. It will also benefit the economy in land, sea and rail transport areas, as well as mass-market applications, supporting user safety, cost-effectiveness and sustainable development.

Early Service Goals

The launched open service aims to carry-out technical trials, and to undertake with partner airlines field demonstrations for aircraft to demonstrate the benefits of the future operational safety-of-life SBAS services, expected in 2024. It will also include early precise point positioning (PPP) and emergency warning service, both to be demonstrated.

The signal in space is generated by a dedicated system testbed, developed as part of the “SBAS for Africa and Indian Ocean” preliminary design phase, financed by the European Union and awarded to a Thales Alenia Space joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%). The system prototype uses the SAGAIE reference station network deployed by CNES and ASECNA with the support of Thales Alenia Space.

The signal is broadcast via the SBAS payload on Nigcomsat-1R GEO satellite of the Nigerian Communications Satellite and an uplink station deployed in Abuja (Nigeria). It is compliant to the Standards and Recommended Practices of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, and the Minimum Operational Performance Standard developed by the RTCA (Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics) organization. It will be visible in the whole Africa and Indian Ocean, up to the West Australian coast, and also in Europe.

“We are proud to be part of this ambitious program to provide satellite navigation services in the Africa and Indian Ocean region. The use of our geostationary communication satellite Nigcomsat-1R navigation payload to broadcast the first signal will be Africa’s premier contribution to SBAS as a regional satellite-based augmentation system for the continent,” said Abimbola Alale, MD/CEO of NIGCOMSAT Ltd.

“Our long-standing expertise acquired with the development of EGNOS SBAS in Europe and KASS SBAS in Korea combined with our new leading-edge satellite positioning technologies makes Thales Alenia Space the ideal partner to best support countries to implement their own SBAS efficiently. The equatorial region represents also a key engineering challenge for such a system due to difficult ionosphere conditions, for which Thales Alenia Space has developed a proven solution,” said Benoit Broudy, vice president of the Navigation business at Thales Alenia Space in France.

“The provision of the first African SBAS early service is a crucial major step forward in the development of satellite navigation in the AFI Region, and in the deployment of the ‘SBAS for Africa and Indian Ocean’ system, the navigation solution for Africa by Africa. It demonstrates the ambition and commitment of ASECNA to enhance air navigation safety for the benefit of the whole continent, in line with my vision for the unification of the African Sky,” stated Mohamed Moussa, director general of ASECNA.

Thales Hawkei Protected Mobility Vehicle Reaches Full-Rate Production - Overt Defense -,"Wed, 16 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm92ZXJ0ZGVmZW5zZS5jb20vMjAyMC8wOS8xNi9hdXN0cmFsaWFuLXRoYWxlcy1oYXdrZWktcmVhY2hlcy1mdWxsLXJhdGUtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Pin 0 Shares

The Thales Hawkei (also known affectionately as the Baby Bushmaster) is set to begin full-rate productionfor the Australian Defence Force (ADF). Under the LAND 121 Phase 4 contract awarded to Thales, the production will be managed entirely at their manufacturing facilities in Bendigo, Victoria.

A total of 1100 Hawkei protected mobility vehicles and 1058 trailers are due to begin delivery mid-2021. Approximately 50 vehicles will be produced each month. An unspecified percentage of Hawkei platforms will be fitted with the Australian designed and manufactured Electro Optic Systems (EOS) Remote Weapon Station mounting the .50 M2 Browning heavy machine or 7.62x51mm FN MAG58 general purpose machine gun.

Defence Minister Linda Reynolds noted:

“This is a highly effective capability being delivered in partnership between Defence and industry that builds on Thales’s iconic Bushmaster, which has been highly successful on operations overseas and exported around the world. The Hawkei is a significant enhancement to existing land capability that will provide superior mobility, survivability and communications, while protecting the lives of our soldiers when operating in increasingly lethal and complex environments.”

As we have noted in the past, Australia’s adoption of the Hawkei has not been without controversy including an on-going challenge to have a critical Auditor General’s report released in an un-redacted form. Critics believe the report favoured the US-made Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) and the decision to adopt the Hawkei owed more to keeping jobs in Australia. What will happen to the Bendigo facility post mid-2022 when the last Hawkeis are manufactured is open to conjecture.

In related news, Hawkei has been short-listed by the Polish Ministry for National Defence for their armoured personnel protection vehicle requirement. Three other platforms have also been short-listed to move to the next stage of evaluation – the Fortress Mk2 developed jointly by France’s Arquus and Poland’s H. Cegielski-Poznan; the Patriot II from the Czech Tatra and H. Cegielski-Poznan; and the Polish Tur V from AMZ Kutno."

The sound of space

If you’ve ever seen a rocket launch, you’ve undoubtedly been struck by the tremendous noise it generates – even when you’re a couple kilometers away. Now imagine the satellite sitting on top of the launcher and how much noise it’s exposed to!

Long before it gets to that point, at Thales Alenia Space we make sure that our satellites can withstand such an extreme acoustic environment.

DFAN, a breakthrough in acoustic testing

Thales Alenia Space has conducted a number of tests on new satellite acoustic testing methods. In particular, our test center in Rome has recently been testing flight-standard products by using an exciting new system called DFAN, developed along with our Toulouse test center, and in partnership with Siemens and the DV2 sound experts.

The acronym for Direct Field Acoustic Noise, DFAN uses a cutting-edge technology to test the structural integrity of a satellite. It is used during satellite environment testing to simulate the high acoustic loads the satellite and its subsystems are subjected to during launch.

The standard approach to acoustic tests is based on a very large reverberant structure (about 1,000 cubic meters) with very thick walls.

© NAASA

A reverberant acoustic pressure field is generated by modulators connected to different horns placed in a chamber filled with nitrogen gas. The sound waves are emitted all around the satellite and cover the entire spectrum of launch frequencies (20-10000Hz). The characteristics of the reverberant field are based on recognized international standards for acoustic tests.

​

​

DFAN takes a very different approach, using a disruptive technology inspired by the sophisticated acoustic systems used by bands in stadium concerts. It comprises several loudspeaker arrays in a circle around the satellite, connected to a high-power amplifier to generate the required acoustic field. A set of microphones arranged around the satellite detects the acoustic pressure and uses sophisticated control software to make any required corrections.

For the moment, there are no European standards for this type of acoustic testing.

The direct acoustic field test method produces results that are considered consistent with those generated by the traditional technique. This helps overcome some of the associated constraints: for Thales Alenia Space in Italy, the only restriction was the size and complexity of a reverberant facility.

More versatile, more efficient

DFAN is a mobile system, meaning it can be installed inside the clean room of our test center. With DFAN we can perform all required acoustic tests, giving us the capacity needed for all mechanical tests on our products. The upshot is a significant reduction in costs and risks, since we no longer have to transfer the satellite to outside test centers.

Leading DFAN technology development

Thanks to close teamwork by Thales Alenia Space’s multidisciplinary teams with Siemens and DV2, the DFAN method has been considerably developed and improved over the last three years, especially in terms of test repeatability and acoustic field homogeneity.

DFAN was qualified in 2018 in our Rome test center, after a comprehensive comparative testing program using a satellite mockup previously subjected to the reverberant acoustic field in Cannes, and then to a DFAN direct acoustic field in Toulouse. After analyzing a huge amount of data, the team showed that results from the different test modes corresponded perfectly. Based on this analysis, ESA experts considered this methodology valid for the testing of space products. ESA also agreed to support our efforts to offer Direct Field Acoustic Noise testing as an alternative to the conventional reverberant chamber method.

During the 2018 European Conference for Spacecraft Structures, Materials and Environmental Testing (ECSSMET), a workshop involving ESA, European space agencies and European industry and dedicated to DFAN testing on space hardware, recommended the constitution of a committee for the development of an ESA DFAN handbook for space hardware, to be endorsed by the major space agencies and the space industry.

The major objectives of the ESA DFAN Handbook are the following: To define baseline requirements for the pre-test preparation, test set-up, test execution and results analysis of DFAN testing on space hardware.

To provide a general tool for the approval of DFAN tests performed on space hardware. The added value of the handbook will be its ability to validate the preparation and execution of direct field acoustic tests on space hardware as if it were performed in the conventional way (reverberant chamber). This is the goal that must guide all handbook development efforts.

, said Rafael Bureo Dacal, Lead Mechanical Engineer at ESA/ESTEC and chairman of ESA DFAN HDBK Working Group.

Pushing back the frontiers of conventional space environment testing

DFAN represents a disruptive methodology that pushes back the frontiers of conventional space testing, challenging conventions in favor of radical change, to address the needs of an increasingly dynamic and competitive industrial sector.

This technology falls within the broader scope of development and innovation at the Department of Environmental Testing. This department has two main goals: to redesign testing methodologies by introducing new technologies, and to enhance the efficiency and reliability of existing technologies, in particular by capitalizing on the enormous potential of digital twins.

Teamwork to the fore!

DFAN is also a sterling example of effective cooperation within a multidisciplinary and transnational team. By pooling complementary skills, this team has earned European leadership in the environmental testing of space products."
Introduction of digital axle counters in Indian railways - Thales,"Thu, 24 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvdHJhbnNwb3J0L3JlZmVyZW5jZXMvaW50cm9kdWN0aW9uLWRpZ2l0YWwtYXhsZS1jb3VudGVycy1pbmRpYW4tcmFpbHdheXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Railways are the most important means of transportation in India, with a huge demand for modernisation to improve and increase capacity. Indian Railways have therefore embarked on a modernisation project, exclusively implementing Digital Axle Counter (DAC) for track occupancy detection. To date over 115,000 km of tracks have been upgraded, representing roughly 20%, of the network, with many more installations to come.

Thales, together with its Indian partner Eldyne introduced the first Digital Axle Counter (DAC) in India in 1998, followed by a first trial in 2001 and a consequent cross approval for both Multi Section and Single Section Axle Counter in 2004.

Since this introduction by Thales, Axle Counters have become the No. 1 Train Detection system in India with an exponential growth rate experienced over the last years.

"From Turin to Cannes, and from Baikonur all the way to Mars! - Thales","Tue, 29 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbmV3cy90dXJpbi1jYW5uZXMtYW5kLWJhaWtvbnVyLWFsbC13YXktbWFyc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"While the ExoMars* program may seem like science fiction to some of you, it’s about to head for the planet Mars on its second mission. The entire spacecraft, comprising the carrier and descent modules, the landing platform and ESA’s new rover, is scheduled for a 2022 launch. Our valorous vessel is set for a voyage through the Solar System of nearly 500 million kilometers before it can send the landing platform down to Mars.

Health sanitary measures in Europe and around the world impacted our activities at the beginning of the pandemic. In addition, some additional testing was necessary to secure the second part of the mission, which is officially postponed to September 2022, the next launch window for a new space expedition to Mars.

However, the program has kept moving forward, as the European space industry, led by Thales Alenia Space as prime contractor, teamed up with the European Space Agency to adapt to these evolving conditions. The European teams invested in this program worked in unison to complete scheduled operations on the carrier and descent modules, the landing platform and the rover, facing this huge challenge with passion and panache.

© Thales Alenia Space

During recent weeks Thales Alenia Space’s Turin plant completed several decisive steps forward in final integration of the Martian spacecraft. For instance, the carrier module was mated to the Kazachok landing platform, supplied by Russia. Also on tap was integration of the solar panels on the Rosalind Franklin rover. These are critical parts of the mission, because they will determine the rover’s operational lifespan. The solar panels will of course supply the energy needed by the rover to drill 2 meters deep into the Martian soil… and perhaps dig out bacteria that would be irrefutable proof of traces of life on the Red Planet.

These impressive operations are even more extraordinary, considering that they are the product of teams from across Europe working together under difficult circumstances to make sure the mission succeeds as planned.

Very strict measures have been applied at all Thales Alenia Space facilities to ensure the health and safety of all employees and partners, without impacting either quality or the schedule.

A few short days ago, the entire “spacecraft composite” for ExoMars 2022, except the rover, was shipped from Turin to Cannes.

The Rosalind Franklin rover stayed in Turin a little longer to complete integration. Once reunited, they will undergo a series of demanding tests and measurements over the coming months to make sure they are ready to go! Among the scheduled procedures are mass property measurements, dynamic balancing and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) tests.

At the same time, the Rover’s “Earth Twin” will be transferred by the end of the year to the Rover Operations Control Center at ALTEC (a joint ASI-TAS lab in Turin) to start preparations for mission operations that will first be conducted on Earth, then replicated on Mars.

© Thales Alenia Space

The Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO), launched in 2016, is operating flawlessly in Martian orbit, where it also provides numerous measurements of the atmosphere. It will of course play a decisive role on the 2022 mission, ensuring communications to and from Mars, via ESA’s earth stations, while also keeping the rover and the Kazachok lander in daily contact with their respective control centers, ROCC and SPOCC.

Mars is still far away, in time and distance, but the launch date of 2022 is drawing closer and closer. As the prime contractor, we’re pulling out all the stops to be ready on time. Even the smallest component is essential for mission success and must be rigorously tested if we are to ensure the success of this strategic program. To carry out a voyage through the Solar System, we have to count on industrial perfectionism, attention to detail and a meticulous approach. We’re all “space nuts”, eager to see the Rosalind Franklin rover land on Mars and start its extraordinary mission, a mission that should help answer the million dollar question: is there, or has there ever been, life on Mars? We hope to get an answer in 2023, but in the meantime, all of Europe is holding its breath!

Stay tuned for upcoming Martian Chronicles.

*ExoMars is a joint program between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Russian space agency Roscosmos, designed to study the Martian surface, atmosphere and environment. It will harvest invaluable data, which will keep scientists busy for years to come. Thales Alenia Space is overall prime contractor for ExoMars, at the head of an international industrial team. Within this consortium, Leonardo supplies the drill for soil samples and OHB the carrier module and various rover instruments, with the rover itself supplied by Airbus. NPO Lavochkin is responsible for the landing platform."

Current launch and recovery processes for AUVs require human involvement in the deployment of the AUV from an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV); through either direct placement and retrieval from the water or activation from the platform. This collaboration will determine how best to increase the safety for navy personnel by removing ’the person from the mission’ through an end-to-end automation process.

In this study, Thales Australia will act as the design authority, working with key stakeholders to ensure that all capability and safety requirements are being met to allow Royal Australian Navy personnel to execute their mission safely.

Flinders University, world leaders in marine environments and autonomy, and a key academic partner in the recently announced $15 million TAS-CRC project, will provide subject matter expertise to investigate potential concepts for the Automatic Launch and Recovery System from a USV.

The KDB Usman Harun is the second ship of the Nakhoda Ragam class and was originally built for the Royal Brunei Navy and was ultimately bought by the Indonesia Navy and renamed KRI Usman Harun. Usman Harun is the third ship of the Bung Tomo class.



Dating from the 1990s, the corvette had reached a point where it no longer feasible to maintain the aging electronics of its mission systems. But the ministry knew that its plan to refit and reintegrate the bulk of the ship’s onboard systems wouldn’t be easy. The complexity was far greater than for a new-build project – and no contract for a novice. As the project moved towards the competitive tendering stage, thoughts turned logically to Thales. Indonesia’s navy had recent, highly positive experience with Thales systems on its new Raden Eddy Martadinata Class frigates. Moreover, Thales could offer a cast-iron record in major warship refits – from the Netherlands and Germany, to Thailand and Columbia.

Thales saw the opportunity to help a long-term customer clarify its needs and complete the feasibility work needed. The company drew on strong relations with local Indonesian players – eventually partnering with state-owned enterprise PT Len Industri (Persero), to offer a solid local base and a channel to transfer hi-tech expertise into the country. Thales and PT Len assembled an array of specialists – ranging from experts in electronic warfare, to systems integration and platform engineering by Dutch naval architect Nevesbu. Together, they carried out comprehensive analysis and onboard survey work to produce the detailed blueprint for an integrated set of systems that would bring the frigate bang up to date.

The combination of rigour, experience, and local excellence was a winning formula. In addition, the systems’ commonality with those on other Indonesian ships would reduce training time and facilitate management and maintenance. An ambitious final specification was drawn up, including Thales’s latest-generation TACTICOS Combat Management System, SMART-S Mk2 3D and STIR 1.2 EO Mk2 radars, a Vigile Mk2 ESM, and two new tactical data links – Link Y Mk2 and a tactical data link that will be wholly delivered by PT Len, providing connectivity to Indonesia’s military communications network and enabling the corvette to play its full part in wider naval task forces. Existing weaponry will also be fully integrated, and a new VL MICA surface-to-air missile system added – a significant boost for vessel self-defence.

TACTICOS is at the heart of the upgrade, bringing a step change in performance through its advanced data-processing and presentation abilities. Determined to deliver excellence, Thales also worked hard to ensure that the TACTICOS Maritime Security module could be included within the project’s budget, a feature that will provide vital intelligence by enabling interrogation of the international AIS and ADSB databases of aircraft and shipping. The AI-assisted analysis will automatically alert operators to unusual behavior at sea or in the sky – moving the needle further from reconnaissance to intelligence.

In March 2020, Indonesia’s defence ministry formally launched the modernization, signing an agreement with lead contractor, PT Len, and Thales, to upgrade KRI Usman-Harun – with completion expected by 2023. The project will see Indonesia’s navy equipped with a highly capable and robust ship whose open-architecture systems will guarantee effectiveness for decades to come – whether protecting Indonesia’s economic interests or supporting task forces in wider missions."

Indonesia's $550m SATRIA satellite in focus - SpaceTech Asia,"Wed, 30 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwYWNldGVjaGFzaWEuY29tL2luZG9uZXNpYXMtNTUwbS1zYXRyaWEtc2F0ZWxsaXRlLWluLWZvY3VzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Indonesia is readying its Very High Throughput Satellite SATRIA for launch in 2023. The satellite will provide broadband internet service (to include free WiFi access) to more than 149,400 unserved public service points, including schools, hospitals and local government locations in some of the least developed regions of Indonesia.

The full Ka-band SATRIA satellite, to be positioned at 146°E, will carry more than 150 gigabits per second over the full Indonesian territory. Dedicated to narrowing the digital divide, SATRIA has the ambition to connect 93,900 schools and educational institutions, 47,900 village office locations, sub-districts and regional government offices, 3,700 health facilities, and 4,500 other public service locations not linked by existing satellite or terrestrial infrastructure. The satellite will contribute to digital infrastructure developments in Indonesia. The SATRIA satellite project is being carried out using a Public Private Partnership (PPP) scheme.

Background

During the pandemic, the communication and information sector in Indonesia experienced growth of nearly 11%. “This sector is the only sector that has grown positively to more than 10 percent compared to other sectors,” said Minister of Communication and Information Technology Johnny G. Plate in early September during a press conference. By 2030, Indonesia’s satellite capacity needs are projected to reach 900 Gbps or 0.9 Tbps. It is looking to work on the construction of a “ground segment to complement the space segment development,” according to the Minister.

The Minister explained that currently, Indonesia is utilizing 5 national satellites with a capacity of around 30 Gbps, and 4 foreign satellites with a capacity of 20 Gbps. “Thus, the total capacity of 9 satellites currently used to meet our telecommunication needs is around 50 Gbps. Comparatively, SATRIA’s capacity is certainly much larger, or about 3 times the total capacity of 9 satellites currently being utilized in Indonesia,” he remarked. He added that the satellite will be able to provide “excellent public services, where each service point will have a capacity of 1 Mbps.”

Funding

PT Pasifik Satelit Nusantara (PSN) is an Indonesian satellite communication company. It was formed in 1991 and was the first satellite-based telecommunications company in Indonesia. Satelit Nusantara Tiga (SNT) is an Indonesian satellite service provider company established in 2018, as a venture of PSN, PT Pintar Nusantara Sejahtera (Pintar), PT Nusantara Satelit Sejahtera, and PT Dian Semesta Sentosa (subsidiary of PT Dian Swastatika Sentosa Tbk). PSN and Pintar are the majority shareholders of SNT and both will maintain majority ownership in the operating company throughout the project’s lifetime.

“The capital expenditure for the space segment for this project is worth around US$550 million. 20% of the value will be financed through equity, while the rest is funded through international financing,” the Minister explained.

The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) has just announced that it will issue a US$150-million nonsovereign loan to Satelit Nusantara Tiga (SNT).

“We at SNT are delighted to have approval from AIIB’s Board of Directors for the financing of the project of the Government of Indonesia. The US$150-million long-term financing provided by AIIB is a key part of the fully syndicated financing package of US$435 million. We hope to have approval from the French Export Credit Agency, Bpifrance, and Korea Development Bank to provide the balance of the syndicated financing,” said Adi Rahman Adiwoso, SNT President Director.

“As the first satellite public-private partnership (PPP) project to be supported by AIIB, this ambitious engagement with Indonesia will offer the Bank a valuable opportunity to deepen our broader understanding of the satellite and telecommunications sector in the region, including the opportunities and challenges in structuring similar satellite PPP projects,” said AIIB Vice President, Investment Operations, D.J. Pandian. “The project is closely aligned with the Bank’s Digital Infrastructure Sector Strategy, which allows us to draw on AIIB’s solid skill sets in developing project finance structures and PPP frameworks in the digital infrastructure sector.”

This will be the first satellite PPP project to be supported by AIIB and will be cofinanced in conjunction with HSBC, Santander and Korea Development Bank. Bpifrance is acting as the export credit agency for the debt provided by HSBC and Santander, and for part of the debt provided by Korea Development Bank. Additional information about the Indonesia Multifunctional Satellite Public-Private-Partnership Project can be found here.

Manufacture & Launch

SNT and Thales Alenia Space (Joint Venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%)), announced in early September the signature of a Preliminary Work Agreement to start the activities of SATRIA.

Thales Alenia Space (TAS), acting as prime contractor for this program, initially signed on July 2019 for a consortium led by the domestic satellite operator Pasifik Satelit Nusantara (PSN) on behalf of Indonesia’s Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (Kominfo).

TAS will deliver the High Throughput Satellite (HTS) based on its Spacebus NEO full electric platform and fitted with a fifth-generation digital processor (5G). The company will also be in charge of providing two satellite control centers (main and backup), the telecommand and telemetry stations, and the ground mission segment linked to the fully processed payload. In addition, Thales Alenia Space will put in place a complete training program for PSN engineers, where part of them will join the project team as residents in Cannes and Toulouse during the duration of the program.

“We are particularly honored to reach this important milestone with the beginning of the industrial activities for the SATRIA program, the first HTS telecommunication satellite in Indonesia and the most powerful one over the Asian region”, declared Hervé Derrey, CEO of Thales Alenia Space. “SATRIA will benefit from all the expertise already developed by Thales Alenia Space on its Spacebus NEO platform as well as on its HTS payloads.”

“With a capacity of 150 Gbps, the satellite can provide more than three times the combined national capacities that are currently in use. We are confident that SATRIA can be the solution to the digital gap that still exists in Indonesia,” said Adi Rahman Adiwoso, CEO of PSN.

The launch vehicle to be used will be Space-X’s Falcon 9 Block 5, with the launch expected to take place in 2023. The service life for the satellite will be 15 years."

The CA$2.83 billion ($3bn) project takes Vancouver’s iconic, fully automated SkyTrain underground beneath Broadway, as part of the redevelopment of the corridor through central Vancouver. The project is being carried out by the Broadway Subway Constructors General Partnership, a consortium led by Acciona and Ghella.

The project includes six stations and an interchange with the Canada Line at Arbutus Street and bus services to the University of British Columbia.

Dominique Gaiardo, vice president and managing director for Thales’ Urban Rail Signalling business, said the project would improve accessibility along the corridor.

“This exciting project will improve the livability and access across the vital economic and employment hub of the Broadway Corridor. Thales will continue to build local expertise and provide strong support to the city and is proud to contribute to the mass transit capacity expansion in Vancouver with the innovative SelTrac CBTC system.”

Thales and Vancouver have a significant history together, as the city was the first location for the deployment of the SelTrac system. The SelTrac signalling infrastructure supported the world’s first driverless CBTC system on the Vancouver SkyTrain Expo line. Thales has also provided signalling to the Millennium and Canada lines.

Drawing on the expertise developed in these projects and elsewhere, Thales has an urban rail signalling competence centre located in Burnaby, B.C, which will provide specialised rail signalling experts and local experience to the Broadway project."
Thales Hawkei armoured vehicle shortlisted in Poland - @AuManufacturing,"Sat, 26 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1bWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy5jb20uYXUvdGhhbGVzLWhhd2tlaS1hcm1vdXJlZC12ZWhpY2xlLXNob3J0bGlzdGVkLWluLXBvbGFuZNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Australian developed and built Thales Hawkei armoured patrol vehicle has been shortlisted with five others to supply the armed forces of Poland, according to media reports.

The seven-tonne vehicle, manufactured in Bendigo, has been marketed overseas by the company’s French parent with the potential for a sale of 700 vehicles to Poland the biggest opportunity revealed so far.

Australia is Thales global centre of excellence for armoured vehicles, also developing the highly successful Bushmaster which is in service with seven countries.

While the Polish government wants the new vehicle to be made in Poland, it would still contain considerable Australian content in terms of components, systems and intellectual property.

Key suppliers, such as Bisalloy for its tempered armoured steels, would also be able to bid to supply an overseas made vehicle.

Bisalloy has been increasing its exposure to overseas markets, including establishing a joint venture manufacturing base in China.

In May, 2018 the Hewkei was put through its paces at a military obstacle course in Poland (pictured).

In the same year Australia and Poland signed a bilateral joint statement on defence co-operation.

EOS to supply remote weapons stations to ADF - Australian Defence Magazine,"Wed, 30 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5kZWZlbmNlLmNvbS5hdS9kZWZlbmNlL2xhbmQvZW9zLXRvLXN1cHBseS1yZW1vdGUtd2VhcG9ucy1zdGF0aW9ucy10by1hZGbSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Electro Optic Systems (EOS), has been awarded a $94 million contract to supply 251 Remote Weapon Stations to increase the lethality of the ADF’s protected mobility vehicles.

“EOS will introduce a new-generation Remote Weapon Station capability to equip the Bushmaster and Hawkei protected mobility vehicles within a Battle Group,” Minister for Defence Linda Reynolds said.

“This capability will improve targeting, and better protect our ADF personnel while on operations.”

“This contract is an important step towards increasing the protection that the PMV fleet can provide during operations, while having standardised equipment, and supporting an Australian defence company and its supply chain,"" Stelios Kanavakis, a Defense Analyst at GlobalData, said. ""[These vehicles] would be among the first to be deployed overseas in a contingency, waiting for heavier platforms to arrive at a later stage. Therefore, it is important for these vehicles to feature firepower capabilities and provide protection to themselves or the dismounted troops.""

“The project draws on Australian-owned and developed intellectual property, with more than 80 per cent of the parts sourced through the EOS’ Australian supply chain of more than 140 Australian companies,” Minister for Defence Industry Melissa Price said.

“This will help to deliver ongoing certainty for the EOS workforce in engineering and support, and certainty for EOS’ national supply chain.”

This work with EOS forms part of the Standardisation of Protected Mobility Vehicles Fleet program within the 2020 Force Structure Plan.

Delivery of the new capability is expected to occur from December 2020 to December 2021."
Hawkei going into full-rate production - CONTACT magazine,"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnRhY3RhaXJsYW5kYW5kc2VhLmNvbS8yMDIwLzA5LzAzL2hhd2tlaS1nb2luZy1pbnRvLWZ1bGwtcmF0ZS1wcm9kdWN0aW9uL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Army’s new Australian-designed and built Hawkei protected vehicle is ready to enter full-rate production at Thales’ Protected Vehicles facility in Bendigo, Victoria.

Hawkei was on show at Russell Offices, Canberra, yesterday for the announcement.

Chief of Army Lieutenant General Rick Burr said the event recognised completion of the rigorous acceptance-testing program.

“Australian-designed Hawkei will complement government investment in soldier systems such as armoured fighting vehicles, new watercraft and upgrades to the Bushmaster,” Lieutenant General Rick Burr said.

“Together, these capabilities ensure the ADF has a range of land forces, light to heavy, which are deployable and employable in the immediate region.

“Hawkei’s networked systems allow Army teams to connect with new technologies, each other and other components of the ADF.

“Its protection assures the resilience of the network and gives Australian soldiers confidence in demanding and dangerous environments.”

WO1 Mick Briggs, technical adviser – vehicle systems for the Land-121 Ph 4 PMV-L (Hawkei) project, said soldiers would like the Hawkei’s ease of operation and survivability.

“I think diggers will like the overall package,” WO1 Briggs said.

“Once you have the training and you understand the vehicle, it’s quite easy to operate.

“Even driving around Canberra roads in the dark this morning, negotiating roundabouts, it was pretty easy.”

WO1 Briggs said diggers should have the same faith in the Hawkei that they do with the Bushmaster.

“You get that same confidence when you get into this vehicle, regarding its survivability, operability and manoeuvrability, that you would in the Bushmaster,” he said.

“It just feels the same and you get that air of confidence that it will do what it says on the box.”

Minister for Defence Linda Reynolds said the vehicle has performed exceptionally well throughout comprehensive ballistic and blast testing, meeting Defence’s stringent requirements for protection.

“This is a highly effective capability being delivered in partnership between Defence and industry that builds on Thales’s iconic Bushmaster, which has been highly successful on operations overseas and exported around the world,” Minister Reynolds said.

“Hawkei is a significant enhancement to existing land capability that will provide superior mobility, survivability and communications, while protecting the lives of our soldiers when operating in increasingly lethal and complex environments.”

Under project LAND 121 Phase 4, 1100 Hawkei vehicles and 1058 trailers will be delivered, with the full-rate production vehicles expected to commence delivery from mid next year.

Hawkei set for full rate production - Australian Defence Magazine,"Mon, 07 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5kZWZlbmNlLmNvbS5hdS9kZWZlbmNlL2xhbmQvaGF3a2VpLXNldC1mb3ItZnVsbC1yYXRlLXByb2R1Y3Rpb27SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Army’s new Australian-designed and built Hawkei protected vehicle is ready to enter full-rate production at Thales’ Protected Vehicles facility in Bendigo, Victoria.

Under Land 121 Phase 4, 1,100 Hawkei vehicles and 1,058 associated trailers will be delivered, with the full rate production vehicles expected to commence delivery from mid-2021.

Minister for Defence Linda Reynolds said the vehicle has performed exceptionally well throughout comprehensive ballistic and blast testing.

“This is a highly effective capability being delivered in partnership between Defence and industry that builds on Thales’s iconic Bushmaster, which has been highly successful on operations overseas and exported around the world,” Minister Reynolds said.

“The Hawkei is a significant enhancement to existing land capability that will provide superior mobility, survivability and communications, while protecting the lives of our soldiers when operating in increasingly lethal and complex environments.

“This is yet another example of Defence and defence industry managing business practices in a COVID-19 safe manner to continue delivering ADF capability.”

Senator for Victoria, Sarah Henderson said the vehicle’s production is a welcome boost to the Victorian economy.

“Approximately 50 vehicles per month will be manufactured out of the Thales Protected Vehicles facility in Bendigo until mid-2022,” Senator Henderson said.

“The Hawkei’s production will sustain around 210 jobs in Thales’ workforce in Bendigo, and around 180 additional jobs nation-wide as part of Thales's supply chain.

“For many small-to-medium enterprises, work on the Hawkei has provided business continuity and enabled investment in people and facilities, as well as diversification into other Defence projects and adjacent industries.”

Eighteen of Thales’s key 25 suppliers are based in Victoria, including:

Albins Performance Transmissions, based in Ballarat, for the vehicle cross drive, steering rack, castings and shafts;

Flexible Drive Agencies, based in Oakleigh, for the wiper and gear selector assembly;

Thomas Warburton, based in Dandenong South, for fasteners and hardware; and

Gough Transport Solutions, based in Noble Park, for the pneumatic system.

Defence says it plans to fit a quantity of the Hawkei protected mobility vehicles with the Electro Optic Systems Remote Weapon Stations.

The CEATAC radar, designed and built by CEA Technologies in Canberra, is also capable of being fitted onto the Hawkei utility vehicle and trailer."
Aussie Hawkei military vehicle enters production - carsales.com.au - carsales.com.au,"Thu, 03 Sep 2020 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhcnNhbGVzLmNvbS5hdS9lZGl0b3JpYWwvZGV0YWlscy9hdXNzaWUtaGF3a2VpLW1pbGl0YXJ5LXZlaGljbGUtZW50ZXJzLXByb2R1Y3Rpb24tMTI2MDMzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Heavily-armoured 4x4 military machine begins full-scale production in Bendigo

Mainstream car manufacturing died in Australia when Ford, Toyota and Holden closed their factories by the end of 2017, but the heavily armed – and armoured – Hawkei military vehicle shows there’s still plenty of life left in local auto-making.

Thales Protected Vehicles in Bendigo, Victoria, is now building the Hawkei protected vehicle, a 10-tonne 4x4 machine with a 3000kg payload and a four-tonne towing capacity.

carsales has spotted the Hawkei, the successor to the Bushmaster, undergoing testing in various proving grounds over the past half decade and it’s fair to say the new vehicle is an absolute beast, it sheer length, width and height dwarfing pretty much anything else on the road.

Thales has a contract to build 1100 Hawkei vehicles and 1058 associated trailers, with deliveries to the Australian Defence Force (ADF) expected from mid-2021.

Its production will support around 200 local jobs in Bendigo and a further 180 at 25 suppliers, 18 of which are located in Victoria, with 50 vehicles day produced until mid-2022.

Australia’s own Humvee, the Hawkei was officially launched in Canberra today and will deliver “unparalleled levels of blast and ballistic protection for a helicopter transportable vehicle,” which means it can be airdropped into hot zones."
