For a new school full of the latest technology, opening day was remarkably smooth. Enrollment in the school has exceeded forecasts made last spring, and new students continue to be enrolled as the high school gains more notice. Grass on the large sports field is growing very well, which should permit its use this fall. The school’s administrator, Mrs. Ashley Bahor, and her entire staff send their appreciation to all Thales families for their patience the past year while the school was under construction.

Two more Thales campuses are well underway – a new K5 school is now under construction in the heart of the new Knightdale Station development in Knightdale, a project of the Preston Development Company. It will open in July, 2016 and is easily accessible to families across southeastern Wake County and into neighboring Wilson and Johnston Counties.

Thales Academy is again teamed with Preston Development in its large Chatham Park project located between Pittsboro, NC and Jordan Lake in eastern Chatham County. The two organizations recently signed an agreement for a large campus to be located on the eastern edge of Pittsboro within the first phase of Chatham Park’s development. The initial K5 school is planned for a July, 2017 opening. Thales Academy’s unique, four-year engineering program, the L.I.T., played an important role in PDC’s interest in having a K-12 campus at Chatham Park, which is expected to attract high-tech businesses that require the strong STEM skills for which Thales Academy has established a national reputation as a leader.

Brett Okamoto: Michael Bisping earns split decision win over Thales Leites in Glasgow - ESPN,"Sat, 18 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVzcG4uY29tL21tYS9zdG9yeS9fL2lkLzEzMjc4OTY2L21pY2hhZWwtYmlzcGluZy1lYXJucy1zcGxpdC1kZWNpc2lvbi13aW4tdGhhbGVzLWxlaXRlcy1nbGFzZ2930gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Fighting in the United Kingdom for the first time in nearly five years on Saturday, Michael Bisping did what he's always done in the European region -- he won.

Bisping (27-7) defeated Thales Leites via split decision at UFC Fight Night on Saturday in Glasgow, Scotland. The middleweight bout headlined the event, which took place at SSE Hydro Arena.

The 36-year-old British veteran, who has never lost a fight in the UK, kept Leites (25-5) guessing in a mostly standup fight, but it was far from an easy win. Despite Bisping clocking Leites with 113 strikes, according to Fightmetric, the Brazilian continued to walk forward with power punches and had Bisping hurt on multiple occasions.

Judges Mark Collett and Howard Hughes scored the five-round fight for Bisping, 49-46 and 48-47, respectively. Judge Paul Sutherland had it for Leites, 48-47. ESPN.com saw the 185-pound contest 49-46 for Bisping.

""I felt I was in control of the fight for the most part,"" Bisping said. ""He hit me with a couple of good shots on two occasions, but other than that, I felt great and I felt in control. I think I'm 17-0 in the UK now and it means the world to me to still be taking out top 10 guys after 10 years with the organization. I am capable of fighting for that title.""

As much as Bisping's varied attack had Leites bewildered at times, it never had him hurt. Bisping mixed his strikes up beautifully, scoring almost at will with inside leg kicks, the jab and overhand right. He maintained constant movement as he threw, circling away from Leites' power while utilizing every inch of the Octagon.

Leites wore all of Bisping's offense incredibly well, however, and his stamina held up in what was his first trip into a fifth round since a loss to Anderson Silva in a UFC title fight in April 2009.

Early in the third round, Leites landed a big right hand that had Bisping on uncertain legs. The punch opened a small cut over Bisping's left eye and he quickly tied Leites up in a clinch to prevent further punches. Leites failed to capitalize on the moment, showing perhaps a small sign of temporary fatigue. Later in the round, he caught a Bisping leg kick and turned it into a takedown, but couldn't keep Bisping down and, in fact, barely appeared to try. It was the only converted takedown of the fight for the Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt.

By the fourth round, it was clear Leites was only looking for the big knockout punch. Usually so good at slipping that big punch, Bisping's legs looked heavy, perhaps from leg kicks landed by Leites earlier in the fight and there were several close calls for him in the pocket. Midway through the fifth, he loudly asked his corner how much time was left in the fight.

""I'm upset of course, because I committed a lot of mistakes,"" Leites said. ""That's five, five-minute rounds, you know? He knows how to use the Octagon space very well.""

Bisping earned his first winning streak since December 2011. Prior to Saturday, he had alternated wins and losses in his last nine fights. Leites saw an eight-fight win streak snapped.

Dunham manhandles hapless Pearson

Evan Dunham worked Ross Pearson over on the floor and completely stifled his standup en route to a lopsided unanimous decision.

Dunham (16-6) took Pearson's back in the first and second rounds and nearly submitted him with an armbar early in the fight. There was no suspense as the cards were read, as Dunham won comfortably: 30-27, 30-27 and 29-28.

""Ross is a tough dude,"" Dunham said. ""He hits hard. It would be dumb to play into his game. I've been around the sport for awhile and decided to go the smart route, grapple him.""

Pearson (17-9) defended a handful of takedowns, but when he did give one up, he was at a complete loss on the ground. Dunham locked Pearson into a body triangle in the opening two rounds, where he looked to secure a rear-naked choke. Near the end of the first round, Dunham transitioned into an armbar that had Pearson twisting in agony, but the Brit refused to tap.

Although Pearson managed to escape all of Dunham's submission attempts, he looked somewhat hesitant on the feet due to the threat of the takedown. Any time he did put his weight forward and lay into a right hand, Dunham would drop levels and shoot on a double leg. In the third, with Pearson needing a knockout, Dunham kept him in a clinch along the cage wall.

After losing three consecutive fights from 2013-to-2014, the Las Vegas-based Dunham has bounced back with consecutive wins.

""I try to consider myself a journeyman -- a fighter's fighter,"" said Dunham, when asked what he wanted next. ""They'll call me with a name and I'll be there.""

Duffy submits Jorge in Round 1

Irish lightweight Joseph Duffy cruised to his second win in the UFC, tapping out Ivan Jorge via triangle at just 3:05 of the first round.

Duffy (14-1), who has best-known for a 2010 win over UFC interim champion Conor McGregor, extended his win streak four with the victory. It is the 27-year-old's ninth career win by submission.

""This is my life,"" said Duffy, who has competed in professional boxing as well as mixed martial arts. ""This is what I love doing. I feel no reason to be nervous. This is the place I want to be in everyday.""

A member of Tristar Gym in Montreal, Duffy has been nothing short of spectacular thus far in the UFC. He kept the fight against Jorge (26-5) out in space, utilizing head movement to slip the Brazilian's punches while lighting him up with inside leg kicks, right hands and then two knees up the middle. Jorge attempted to drive Duffy into the fence and get him to the floor, but he calmly defended the shot and then circled away.

Midway through the round, after eating a hard right uppercut, Jorge grew very desperate for the takedown. In an ensuing scramble, Duffy fell to his back, locked in the triangle immediately and produced the tap.

""I'm confident in my game,"" Duffy said. ""I'm training with some of the best guys in the world, week-in and week-out. No matter where a fight goes, I'm comfortable I can beat them.""

After the result of the fight was read, Duffy requested a spot on the UFC's recently announced Dublin event, which takes place Oct. 24 at 3Arena.

Calderwood brawls past Casey

Joanne Calderwood managed to outlast late-notice replacement Cortney Casey in an absolute slugfest to earn her first win of 2015.

Calderwood (10-1), a Glasgow native, survived a nasty flurry by Casey in the opening seconds of the strawweight bout, before going on to win a unanimous decision. Judges scored the bout for Calderwood via scores of 30-27, 30-27 and 29-28.

Although it was a loss, it was an impressive UFC debut for Casey (4-2), who accepted the fight on 10-day's notice after Calderwood's original opponent withdrew. According to Fightmetric, Calderwood landed an insane 254 total strikes, but Casey was active as well, landing 109 of her own and gutting through a crippling spinning back kick to the liver in the third round.

""It wasn't pressure, it was pleasure,"" said Calderwood, on fighting in front of the hometown crowd. ""I just get paid to come out and put on a performance, so that's what I'm going to do from now on. It's been so emotional the past eight weeks.""

Casey had Calderwood in trouble as early as the first exchange. She ate a few leg kicks but fired back with a counter left hook and right cross that had Calderwood retreating backwards. Calderwood, a former cast member on The Ultimate Fighter reality series, regained her sense, however, and tied Casey up in the clinch. Later in the round, Casey pulled guard and went for an armbar, but Calderwood escaped and ended up in top position.

The pace only picked up in the second round, as Calderwood bit down on her mouthpiece and walked forward into the Thai clinch. She targeted Casey's midsection with knees, while throwing short elbows upstairs. The right hand started to land frequently for Calderwood and she scored several more takedowns that kept Casey guessing.

A spinning back kick to the body dropped Casey early in the third and it appeared Calderwood was headed for a finish, as she followed her to the ground with strikes. Casey survived, however, and even managed to land several more good punches later in the round, but her power had been mostly zapped by the high pace.

Calderwood, 28, improves to 2-1 in the UFC. She suffered a first-round submission loss to Maryna Moroz in her last fight in April.

Edwards cruises past Pawlak

Leon Edwards earned his second consecutive win inside the Octagon, out-pointing fellow welterweight Pawel Pawlak in a three-round unanimous decision.

Edwards (10-2) landed a beautiful left head kick in the third round that dropped Pawlak in the center of the cage, but was unable to turn it into a finish. All three judges scored a shutout for Edwards, 30-27.

Both Edwards and Pawlak (11-2) landed their fair share of offense, but it was Edwards who clearly scored the harder strikes. He knocked Pawlak into the fence on several occasions with the straight left and popped him in the second round with a high spinning wheel kick.

Edwards, who fights out of England, also demonstrated his wrestling at times -- particularly in the second round, as he reversed a takedown attempt by Pawlak and spent a good amount of time in top position.

""Everyone thinks I'm a striker, but I practice all martial arts,"" Edwards said. ""I came out here to prove that.""

Pawlak, 26, drops to 1-2 in the UFC. Both of the Polish welterweight's losses have come via unanimous decision.

Ray knocks out Mafra in Round 1

Scotland's Steven Ray delivered a first-round knockout for the hometown crowd against an overmatched Leonardo Mafra.

Ray (18-5) wobbled Mafra with a counter right hook before knocking him down moments later with a straight left. Referee Marc Goddard called an official stop to the lightweight contest at 2:30 of the opening round. To the delight of the Scottish crowd, Steven Ray steamrolled over Leonardo Mafra for a first-round TKO win. Martin McNeil for ESPN

After the fight, the 25-year-old admitted he'd had a 'nightmare' camp after a motorcycle accident sidelined him for two weeks during training.

""I couldn't even get warmed up in the back -- that first round was my warmup,"" Ray said.

The setbacks in camp did not show up in the fight, as Ray was mostly dominant on the feet. Mafra (12-3) didn't appear to have any clue how to close on the southpaw, eventually just running forward with kicks that left him open to the counter.

Ray improves to 2-0 in the UFC. He won a short-notice fight against Marcin Bandel via TKO in April."

PARIS, July 7 (UPI) —

Risk reduction flight tests for integrating Thales and Elisra’s NATO STANAG 7085 data link on an unmanned aerial vehicle have been conducted in Israel.

The tests by Thales and Israel Aerospace Industries involved the Israeli company’s Heron medium-altitude long-endurance UAV, and Thales’ new TMA 6000 data link terminal with Elisra Radio Frequency Modules and antennas.

During the testing infrared and daylight videos were transmitted in real time to the ground control station, and the sensors were controlled in real time from the ground.

Thales’ TMA 6000 complies with NATO Standardization Agreement — or STANAG — 7085, the waveform standard for transmission of videos, images and other intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance data from onboard sensors to dedicated ISR stations to ensure NATO interoperability and high resistance to jamming and interception.

Additional details of the risk reduction testing were not disclosed.

The Heron UAV has an endurance time of as much as 45 hours. Different variants of the aircraft are operated by more than 15 nations, including Israel, Australia, Canada, France and Germany.

Hanwha Emerges as South Korea's Defense Giant - Defense News,"Sun, 26 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS90b3AtMTAwLzIwMTUvMDcvMjYvaGFud2hhLWVtZXJnZXMtYXMtc291dGgta29yZWEtcy1kZWZlbnNlLWdpYW50L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SEOUL — From a gunpowder producer to an all-round defense firm, Hanwha Corp. has emerged as the new defense giant in South Korea.



Founded in 1952 during the Korean War, the company is the root for Hanwha Group, the nation's 9th largest conglomerate.

The corporation completed its acquisition of Samsung Techwin and Samsung Thales on June 29.

The acquisition was signed last November when Samsung Electronics sold a 32.4 percent stake in Samsung Techwin, maker of the K9 self-propelled howitzer and aircraft engines, for $765 million, as part of a deal worth $1.8 billion between Samsung Group and Hanwha Group.

Samsung Techwin owns a 50 percent stake in Samsung Thales, a precision weapons maker jointly funded by the French Thales Group, so Hanwha Corp. gains managing rights over the company.

With the acquisition of Samsung's defense branches, the revenue of Hanwha Corp. could nearly triple.

Last year, Hanwha Corp. recorded $1.03 billion ​ in defense sales of ammunition, bomb fuses, rockets and UAVs.

Samsung Techwin had about $904.8 ​ million and Samsung Thales $580 million. Combined, Hanwha Corp. could rack up $2.3 billion of sales.

""As the top defense manufacturer in Korea, we'll compete with the world's top 30 defense firms and further increase our presence in the global defense market,"" said Lee Sung-soo, senior vice president of operations at Hanwha Corp.

Kim Dae-young, an analyst at the Korea Defense & Security Forum, anticipated that Hanwha's arms exports will rise.

""Hanwha is to be engaged in almost all sectors of the defense industry,"" said Kim Dae-young, an analyst at the Korea Defense & Security Forum. ""In particular, the company will have an unrivaled position in the artillery manufacturing sector both for local supply and exports.""

Hanwha's key artillery system is the Chunmoo multiple launch rocket system, which is based on a wheeled chassis and can fire an extended 130mm rocket up to 36 kilometers.

The K9 self-propelled 155mm howitzer will also boost the reputation of Hanwha Corp. The artillery is equipped with state-of-the-art mobility systems, including a 1,000-horsepower engine, and has a firing range of 40 kilometers.

Samsung Techwin signed a deal with Poland last December to sell 120 K9 howitzers. The deal is valued at about $320 million. The deal was the second of its kind after a deal with Turkey in 2011 to sell 350 K9 howitzers.



Jang Won-joon, director of the defense and aerospace industry team at the Korea Institute of Industrial Economics and Trade, pays more attention to the potential synergy between Hanwha and Samsung Thales.

""Samsung Thales produces radars, sensors and combat software systems, which are crucial for developing advanced weapons systems,"" Jang said. ""That means Hanwha gets a foothold for developing a full range of modern warfare weapons from sensors to striking weapons.""

Earlier this month, a delegation from the Thales Group visited Hanwha headquarters here to discuss business strategy in the future, according to Hanwha Thales officials.

""Both sides exchanged views on ways to help strengthen the firm's marketing here and abroad,"" a Hanwha spokesman said. ""Discussions are ongoing to lay out business plans for the newly launched firm.""

Hanwha Corp. is also expected to expand its influence in the aerospace industry, as it has a 10 percent stake in Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI).

KAI shares are split by Hanwha, Hyundai Rotem with some 10 percent, Doosan with some 5 percent. The government owns about 26 percent.

Hanwha has long sought to take over shares in KAI, and it may try to get more stakes in the future to develop itself into a Korean-version Lockheed Martin.

""Lockheed Martin, for instance, develops not only fighter aircraft, such as F-16 and F-35, but also guided missiles, radar systems and aerospace systems,"" the spokesman said. ""Should Hanwha find ways to make a synergy effect between its existing weapons systems and KAI's aircraft and aerospace businesses, it could be a top defense manufacturer in the world.""

Virgin America plans IPTV seatback integration with Ka connectivity - Runway Girl Network,"Fri, 31 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTUvMDcvdmlyZ2luLWFtZXJpY2EtZXllcy1pcHR2LXNlYXRiYWNrLWludGVncmF0aW9uLWZvci1wYXNzZW5nZXJzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Virgin America’s recent confirmation that it has added a new inflight internet provider represents more than simply a new solution for a carrier that has long been on the forefront of connectivity. In this case we’re seeing the adoption of brand new technology in the form of ViaSat’s as-yet-uncertified hybrid Ka/Ku connectivity system, a new direct partnership between Virgin America and ViaSat, and an airline customer shift from one vendor to another (albeit for a fraction of its fleet); all three are big news. But there’s more, and it involves a new integration project between ViaSat and Virgin America’s seatback IFE provider, Panasonic Avionics.

The initial ViaSat deliverables include a Ka-band-supported internet offering for Virgin America that is similar to the service and kit currently flying on JetBlue and the Continental portion of United Airlines’ fleet. This includes using the Thales-provided radome and STC. Where it differs is that Virgin America will have only one antenna – providing IP connectivity – under the radome rather than two (Data + TV). But Virgin America will continue to provide live television through its DISH TV partnership. Rather than beaming the content to the aircraft via a dedicated, Panasonic-provided Ku-band antenna, the TV content will be handled via IPTV across the ViaSat Ka-band connection. “We’ll just be using capacity and putting the live television over the same bandwidth that’s being used by the passengers for connectivity,” ViaSat director Don Buchman tells RGN.

It sounds similar to how Global Eagle provides TV to Southwest, but GEE uses “a single Ku widebeam that covers the US so the same channel is going to every plane, whereas with ViaSat you have dozens of spotbeams – something like 40 or 50 – that you’ll need to light up to do this,” says satellite industry consultant Tim Farrar, noting that, as described, “It’s a very inefficient use of bandwidth. On the other hand, ViaSat has ten times more capacity than Ku-band systems. More than that. So it can afford, potentially, to distribute it over 40 beams simultaneously if that’s what they need to do.”

These first few planes will keep the Ka-band-only antenna and are eventually expected to serve routes that mostly remain in the ViaSat-1 coverage range, which is to say that eventually they will not be used on Hawaii routes.

Hawaii service will take advantage of ViaSat’s new hybrid Ka/Ku antenna, which still requires FAA certification. The antenna can connect to either a Ka or Ku satellite, allowing Virgin America and ViaSat to take advantage of the higher-speed Ka service when flying mainland US routes but still keep connectivity on the overwater flights.

It’s important to note that when Virgin America launches its new Hawaii service, flights will not actually have any Ku or Ka connectivity available for the first few months, but there will still be stored entertainment content via Virgin America’s in-seat ‘Red’ IFE system provided by Panasonic. The server could also be used to stream cached content to passengers’ PEDs.

Explaining the staged installation process to RGN, Virgin America VP communications Abby Lunardini says, “Initially when we launch Hawaii we won’t have the wifi connectivity but we plan to have it in 2016. In those interim months we have our Red inflight entertainment platform and our Red beta platform on those aircraft so we plan to have a lot more cached content than we have even today to bridge the gap.”

Significantly, IPTV-seatback integration is in the cards, she says; this would see Panasonic and ViaSat working together (even as the Virgin America deal with ViaSat could be seen as a blow to Panasonic’s receive-only Ku TV offering). “This is exactly what Panasonic wants to do to make sure airlines keep putting seatback IFE on board, so they need to make this work regardless of bandwidth because the alternative would be to say, ‘we don’t need seatback IFE, just give people bandwidth’. So it behooves Panasonic to make seatback IFE a good service for people because otherwise they’ll lose all their screen revenue. It’s the Panasonic approach, rather than the GEE/Gogo approach of ‘you don’t need seatback anything’,” opines consultant Farrar.

The integration project would see Panasonic collaborate again to a certain degree with rival IFE provider Thales; the two already work together for United’s Continental fleet. These days, airlines make even the toughest competitors work together.

However, while the initial Ka-band connectivity deployment is happening in partnership with Thales using the Ka antenna and radome already certified for A320 use, ViaSat’s Ka/Ku hybrid antenna will eventually use a new radome being developed in-house by ViaSat. This, of course, raises the question of whether ViaSat will need Thales as an implementation partner for the Ka/Ku installs. ViaSat’s Buchman believes the answer is likely no, saying, “It will be mostly on our own because the radome will be a radome we developed in-house so we’ll make use of most of the STC work we’re doing there already.”

Buchman also expects that more future deals will occur without a third party implementation partner, and ViaSat remains open to such deals – whatever gives the most comfort to airlines. “More and more we’ve built up the expertise in-house. If [the airline] is comfortable with another vendor we can partner with that other vendor. If they just want one shop, ViaSat can bring that,” he says.

Virgin America is not the first direct deal ViaSat has signed though neither this nor El Al’s planes are flying with ViaSat equipment yet. In the case of the latter, ViaSat is learning that the STC process is a laborious one; the company is still waiting for approval. The STC process is also keeping ViaSat from going direct to the hybrid Ka/Ku antenna on the initial 2015 installs for Virgin America, Buchman explains. “It is just the certification schedule.” But he is confident that the Spring 2016 deliveries will be able to fly the new kit, noting, “We’re well along with [STC]. We’re through bird-strike and all the fun stuff.”

As for what the shift says to the industry overall, an industry executive notes, “Here you’ve got a premier airline that realizes ‘I’ve got to have a high-speed, low-cost solution if I’m going to compete,’ and they’re breaking ranks.” It remains to be seen, however, if this is a one-off event or the beginning of a greater shift. Gogo clearly knows that satellite is going to be a major component of future connectivity plays – even as it presses the FCC to auction more ATG spectrum in the US – and the pressure to deliver 2Ku quickly is obviously even higher now. The 2Ku product is a potential upgrade option for Virgin America’s current fleet.

APEX, N.C. (WTVD) -- An ABC11 Eyewitness driving near downtown Apex spotted some controversial signs on the front lawn of a home. The signs called out a brand new private school and town leaders.

It turned out that the signs belong to a man who's known for posting large, eye-catching signs outside his home so everyone can see.

Coming to a stop outside Bryan Smith's home, drivers can't help but see two signs. One refers to President Obama as Muslim. Another reads ""Nightmare on Salem Street"" and proceeds to sarcastically call out Thales Academy, which is a new private school located a few hundred yards from Smith's home, Apex town leaders, and Paul ""Skip"" Stam- a local state representative and local attorney.

Smith said it's all about the road construction that's still going on outside his home that was originally planned to be completed before Thales Academy opened to students on Monday.

""I knew they had no chance of finishing,"" said Smith. ""No chance whatsoever.""

Smith said he's not attacking the school or the construction workers adding a turning lane onto the school's campus. This is not about the school. It's not about the contractor that's doing the work.

""Yes! It's all about principle,"" he said. ""Absolutely, it's about principle!""

Smith said he's urged town leaders from the beginning to abandon the design that will have cars turning left across northbound traffic. He's also upset that construction is now overlapping with the school's opening and hopes his homemade sign proved a point.

""It's silly,"" he said. ""But it's silly that we would find ourselves here. Why not just tell the truth up front?""

Kent Jackson with Apex's Engineering and Construction Management told ABC11 that Thales Academy requested three weeks ago to overlap its opening with road construction. Jackson said the town agreed when it learned the school's initial enrollment would be much lower than originally thought.

Jackson said the construction project should be completed in about three weeks.

The Manchester middleweight was fighting in the UK for the first time in almost five years and kept his record of never losing on home soil intact.

Bisping used his striking ability to earn a victory on the scorecards by margins of 47-48, 49-46 and 48-47 in front of a passionate home crowd.

'To be here as the main event in Scotland is a big deal,' he said. 'Glasgow is a great city, my family are here and we've all had a great time.

'UFC, I'm still here. Ten years later and I'm still unbeaten in the UK. Chris Weidman, Luke Rockhold, Jacare. Any of them, line them up and I'll take them out. That's a fact.'

The middleweight bout played out as a battle between Bisping's volume and Leites's power.

The Brit beat the former jiu jitsu world champion to the punch for the vast majority of the bout, but Leites did manage to land some devastating shots in the third and fifth rounds.

'I'm upset of course, because I committed a lot of mistakes,' Leites said. 'That's five, five-minute rounds, you know? He knows how to use the Octagon space very well.'

Earlier, Ross Pearson lost a unanimous decision in the co-main event against Evan Dunham.

Dunham controlled the pace of the bout over the three rounds and threatened with a tight armbar in the first frame, but Pearson managed to escape just as it looked like he would be forced to tap.

The American, who won by scores of 30-27 (twice) and 29-28, said: 'Ross he's a tough dude. He hits hard. I'd be dumb to play into his game.

'I've been in this game a long time, so I played it smart and went to the ground.'

Joanne Calderwood earned the biggest cheer of the night when her hand was raised after a three-round war with UFC debutant Cortney Casey.

In the first event the promotion has ever put on in Scotland, her win rounded off a perfect night for the home contingent who went 3-0 in the SSE Hydro.

Casey rocked Calderwood early on in the first round, but the Scot managed to battle back in rounds two and three.

She landed a series of elbows and spinning back kicks on Casey and had a lot of success with her overhand right.

And Calderwood hopes to earn a title shot against champion Joanna Jedrzejcyk.

She said: 'All the fans want to see that fight, and obviously, speaking for myself, I want to see that fight, because she's put on a master class with other girls, so it's a fight that excites me.

'I've just lost and just won tonight, so basically, maybe another win or two – it's up to the UFC.

'Yeah, I would be excited for that fight and it would be a stand-up war.'

Fifer Stevie Ray put a stamp on his second appearance in the Octagon with his stunning technical knockout of Leonardo Mafra in the first round of their main event clash. Ray inflicted damage with his right hand, but instead of trying to cover up Mafra threw caution to the wind and exchanged with the Scot.

A right hand sent Mafra stumbling across the Octagon and Ray followed it up with a vicious flurry and some powerful ground and pound that put an end to the Brazilian's night.

Ray claimed that he had suffered an injury in the lead up to the contest in his post-fight interview, and such was the gravity of the injury that he couldn't even warm-up for the Glasgow showdown.

He added: 'It felt unbelievable out there. It was just so good to hear all those fans on my side. I tried to get comfortable and not get too excited, but it felt unbelievable.

'I was expecting a war. I thought it was going to be a really tough fight, but then this is the UFC – every fight is a tough fight. To the people of Scotland: Welcome to the UFC. I hope everybody gets onboard. There's a lot of uneducated people in Scotland when it comes to this sport, but fighting is in our blood.'

The first Scottish fighter to ever grace the Octagon, Robert Whiteford repaid the Glasgow crowd for the massive ovation they gave him as he made his entrance to 'Flower of Scotland'.

Catching Paul Redmond with a left hand, the Irishman fell to the canvas before Whiteford landed a barrage of unanswered blows to finish the contest in the first round.

'I'm on top of Scotland right now, never mind the world,' Whiteford said. 'Emotions came over me at the end and I was going to start crying. I didn't want to cry in front of 11,000 people, so I was out of there and over the fence and into the crowd."

MSG-4, the fourth and last Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) was successfully launched on July 15th, by Arianespace, using the Ariane 5 launch vehicle, from Europe's Spaceport in French Guiana. The satellite was built by Thales Alenia Space on behalf of the European Space Agency and EUMETSAT.



About MSG-4

MSG-4 will be operated by EUMETSAT and will provide meteorological data and monitor the climate across Europe from its position in geostationary orbit at 36,000 kilometers above the Equator, at 3.4. West longitude. MSG-4 will initially be stored in-orbit until it is needed as a replacement for the one of its predecessors, the MSG-1, MSG-2 and MSG-3 satellites, launched in August 2002, December 2005 and July 2012, respectively. The satellite will carry on the mission assigned to these second-generation satellites: provide meteorological observation capabilities for Europe until 2020.



About the second generation satellites

Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellites have made a strong contribution to improving our analysis of weather data. These spin-stabilized satellites (at 100 rpm) incorporate a number of technological innovations. Meteorologists benefit from higher image quality, because of a significant increase in the number of observation channels, along with better radiometric performance and shorter revisit cycles.

The nominal assigned mission is currently handled by the MSG-3 satellite, which provides an updated view of the Earth every 15 minutes. At the same time, MSG-2 provides a ""rapid scan service"", delivering a reduced, Europe-centered image every five minutes. MSG-1, launched in August 2002 and still operational, provides backup to ensure the continuity of these two missions.



Towards increasingly accurate meteorology

European meteorology has become increasingly accurate over the years, thanks to the advanced technology of the Meteosat satellite family. With the first-generation Meteosat satellites, images were updated every 30 minutes, a figure reduced to 15 minutes on the second generation. MTG (Meteosat Third Generation) will further reduce this refresh rate to 10 minutes, making weather forecasts increasingly accurate.



Thales Alenia Space, world leader in geostationary meteorology systems

As on Europe's first two generations of meteorological satellites, Thales Alenia Space is also prime contractor for the third generation, MTG, built in partnership with the German company OHB. The MTG system comprises six satellites, four imaging models and two atmospheric sounders. Including this latest generation, Thales Alenia Space will have built a total of 17 geostationary weather satellites: seven first-generation models, four second-generation and six third-generation.

Following MSG-4, two additional satellites dedicated to climate change monitoring and environmental management, also built by Thales Alenia Space, will be launched this year: Jason-3 and Sentinel-3A.

Regarding MSG-4, Jean-Loïc Galle, President and CEO of Thales Alenia Space, declared:

""Over the last 30 years, millions of people have watched weather forecasts based on Meteosat images, seeing high- and low-pressure zones, cloud cover and other striking satellite pictures on their TVs. In addition to these daily weather forecasts, Meteosat satellites provide vital data used to predict violent weather-related events, including storms, hurricanes and flooding, while also monitoring long-term climate changes. Customers have placed their trust in us since the beginning of geostationary meteorological systems. We continue to capitalize on our unrivaled expertise to give them increasingly sophisticated satellites, such as the MTG already under construction"".

Canada's CF18 bases won't have radar units replaced as $55M deal cancelled - CBC.ca,"Sun, 12 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL3BvbGl0aWNzL2NhbmFkYS1zLWNmMTgtYmFzZXMtd29uLXQtaGF2ZS1yYWRhci11bml0cy1yZXBsYWNlZC1hcy01NW0tZGVhbC1jYW5jZWxsZWQtMS4zMTQ1MTk20gEgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JjLmNhL2FtcC8xLjMxNDUxOTY?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Another multimillion-dollar military purchase has gone off the rails.

The Harper government is terminating its contract with Thales Canada Ltd., which was to supply new radar units to support Canada's CF-18 fighter jet squadrons in Cold Lake, Alta., and Bagotville, Que.

The deal signed in November 2010 was initially worth $55 million for two tactical-control radar systems, with delivery to begin in 2013. Thales won the tender over one other bidder.

Defence Department documents show costs had risen to more than $78 million by 2013. And by November last year, the Public Works Department was deep in negotiations with Thales to resolve problems.

""In February 2015, Canada and Thales reached agreement in principle to terminate this contract by mutual consent,"" said Public Works spokeswoman Annie Trepanier.

Final talks underway

Negotiations for a final termination agreement are still underway, and Public Works declined to provide any information about penalties, losses to the taxpayer or even the reason for the termination.

""Public Works is working with DND [Department of National Defence] to identify an appropriate path forward to meet their long-term capability needs on this project,"" Trepanier said in a terse email.

National Defence documents indicate the military had spent at least $6.5 million on the doomed project by 2013.

The botched deal is yet another military procurement gone sour, alongside the more high-profile F-35 Stealth Fighter project, the Cyclone helicopter purchase to replace the aging Sea Kings, and used British submarines that have been sinkholes for maintenance and repair dollars.

The deal for two Ground Master 400 air-defence radars, a product launched by Thales in 2008, was to replace existing equipment acquired in 1991.

""Our government's investments are helping to ensure that our airmen and women have up-to-date equipment and infrastructure needed to perform their missions,"" Peter MacKay, then defence minister, said in early 2011 when announcing the deal.

MacKay said first deliveries were expected by February 2013, and that 40 jobs would be supported until final deliveries in September this year.

The France-based parent of Thales Canada, Thales Group, said its Ground Master 400 systems have been sold to Germany, Finland and Malaysia, among others.

Canada's existing tactical radar systems are designed to be mobile, and have been deployed to Germany in 2000, Florida in 2008, and to Resolute Bay, Nunavut, in May this year, among other locations. Most of the time, they support Norad fighter-jet training at their home bases by providing a comprehensive picture of the skies up to 450 kilometres away.

When he was defence minister, Peter MacKay checked out the cockpit of an F-35 Joint Strike Fighter in Ottawa in 2010, before the plan to procure the jets fell apart. (Adrian Wyld/Canadian Press) An expert in military procurement, David Perry, said it's not clear whether smaller deals like the radar project are as beset with problems as high-cost contracts. Departments are required to report regularly to Parliament only on major Crown projects worth more than $100 million, which means smaller projects can escape proper scrutiny.

""We tend to place a lot of the focus on the big projects.… Is it only the big ones that have been problematic or are they just the only ones you ever hear about?"" said Perry, a senior analyst with the Ottawa-based Canadian Global Affairs Institute.

Perry said he plans a project beginning next month to examine all military procurement contracts, big and small, to correct for any bias that results from the $100-million reporting requirement.

'No longer supportable'

Public Works issued a notice to the defence industry in early 2008, calling for letters of interest to replace the existing Westinghouse AN/TPS-70 radar systems, saying they were ""past their life expectancy [and] are no longer supportable.""

But National Defence spokesman Maj. James Simiana said the existing systems ""are operational and they are still capable of supporting both Bagotville and Cold Lake.""

An Ottawa spokesman for Thales Canada, Siegfried Usal, confirmed there's an agreement in principle with Public Works to terminate the project.

""No final resolution has been negotiated yet, therefore Thales will not comment further on this,"" Usal said in an email.

Benelux Invest $150 million in Infantry Smart Vests - Defense Update,"Thu, 02 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5zZS11cGRhdGUuY29tLzIwMTUwNzAyX3NtYXJ0X3Zlc3QuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Elbit Systems will serve as the program prime contractor, with Thales Netherlands B.V its main sub-contractor which is responsible for vehicle systems integration, battery and GPS equipment.

Elbit Systems announced today that its subsidiary, Elbit Systems Land and C4I Ltd. was awarded a contract from the Dutch Ministry of Defense, to supply ‘Smart Vests’ to equip the infantry soldiers in the Benelux countries – Netherlands, Belgium and Luxemburg. The contract, valued at approximately US$150 million, will be performed over a five-year period. The initial contract calls for the delivery of 135 pre-production systems – 80 for the Netherlands will be delivered next year, along with 40 for Belgium and 15 for Luxembourg.

Each ‘Smart Vest’ program includes wearable and protective systems for the soldier, command and control systems, including advanced audio and data radio systems, specialized displays and C4I capabilities as well as support systems integrated in combat vehicles. The mobile communication gear consists of the PNR-1000 Software Defined MANET soldier radio from Elbit Systems’ Tadiran division, and a hand held terminal. Operated with touchscreen and integral GPS, soldiers can see each other’s location on a map, access and send information and communicate with other units or headquarters.

“The Smart Vest is a big step forward in safety and performance of the Benelux soldiers at operational deployment,” said Vice Admiral Matthieu Borsboom, Director Defence Materiel Organisation. he said the new gear improves performance in all areas – survivability, mobility and situational awareness, improving overall command and control and operational effectiveness.

a big step forward in safety and performance of the Benelux soldiers

The ‘Smart Vest’ is a co-operation between the soldier modernization programs of the Benelux countries: Netherlands’ VOSS, Belgium’s BEST and Luxemburg’s COMPASS. It is the first strategic joint program of the Benelux countries, and will enhance the warfighter’s survivability and safety while increasing their combat effectiveness empowering their digital capabilities in combat. Based on Elbit Systems’ DOMINATOR system, designed to be light-weight, modular and scalable and will interface with existing systems.

Elbit Systems will serve as the program prime contractor, with Thales Netherlands B.V its main sub-contractor which is responsible for vehicle systems integration, battery and GPS equipment. “We welcome domestic Benelux companies to join us in the project in order to strengthen the support for the local customers”. Bezhalel (Butzi) Machlis, President and CEO of Elbit Systems commented, adding that the fact “that such advanced armies have selected our solutions attests to our technological leadership and to the maturity of our solutions”.

The Benelux requirement is for more than 10,000 vests to be delivered through 2020. This includes 5,500 vests for lead customer the Netherlands, to begin deliveries in 2017 as part of its current Improved Operational Soldier System (VOSS) programme. Belgium has a need for approximately 4,500 systems under its Belgian Soldier Transformation (BEST) programme. Luxemburg is likely to receive few hundred systems for its Cooperative Modernisation Program of the Army for a Soldier System (COMPASS).

The Dutch program will also benefit from the E-Lighter – a new power source developed by Fokker in parallel to VOSS. The E-lighter is a portable diesel generator, that provides 48 hours of power for the ‘Smart Vest’."

“We are at initial stage of discussion for partnering with the (Anil Ambani-led) Reliance Group for smart city projects.”

A Reliance Group spokesperson declined to comment for this story.

“We can offer good solutions, we are the leading player in signaling in railways and urban mobility, which is an very important aspect of smart city,” Caine said.

Thales, in which French firm Dassault group holds 25.3% stake, already has a joint venture with public sector Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) to make radars for both military and civilian markets in India.

It has another joint venture with New Delhi-based Samtel Display Systems Ltd to locally produce and sell avionics systems and helmet-mounted sight display systems for IAF.

“With BEL we are co-developing radars. These products are for both Indian market and exports, and will be developed in a couple of years. With Samtel the production of display for Mirage 2000 upgrade will start soon,” he said.

India recently announced its decision to buy 36 Dassault Rafale jets in “fly-away condition” from France.

Recently, L&T Technology Services purchased 74% of the equity capital of Thales Software India Pvt. Ltd.

On ease of doing business, Caine said: “The Indian market has unique characteristics. You have to be patient in India.”

“India has its own acquisition process,” he added."

Bisping, 36, started off strong and picked his opponent apart in the first two rounds, however, Leites gained momentum early in the third frame after rocking Bisping with a series of punches. Bisping was able to hold on and the perennial top-10 middleweights traded shots for the final two rounds.

Bisping has now won two straight for the first time since 2011. During the fight, he also leapfrogged Frankie Edgar to sit first in significant strikes landed among active UFC fighters. He also now ranks second in total fight time among active fighters — only Edgar has seen more Octagon time.

Leites had an eight-fight win streak snapped. He had gone 5-0 since returning to the UFC in 2013.

In the co-main event, Evan Dunham upset Ross Pearson in a battle of veteran 155-pounders. Pearson’s last four wins had come by knockout but Dunham used his grappling to neutralize the Brit’s striking and earned a unanimous decision victory. Pearson has alternated wins and losses in his last five fights, while Dunham has won his last two bouts.

Also on the main card, Joseph Duffy, the last man to beat UFC superstar Conor McGregor, submitted Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt Ivan Jorge in just over three minutes.

It was the UFC’s debut event in Scotland and Scottish fighters ended up going 3-0 on the card.

Women’s strawweight contender Joanne Calderwood of Glasgow put on a thrilling performance picking up a unanimous decision win over UFC debutant Cortney Casey.

Featherweight Robert Whiteford, a native of Armadale, West Lothian, earned a first-round TKO win over Ireland’s Paul Redmond.

Meanwhile, Fife’s Stevie Ray did the same to Leonardo Mafra in lightweight action.

Council tears strip off City admin over delayed Metro LRT Line - CTV News Edmonton,"Tue, 07 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipQFodHRwczovL2VkbW9udG9uLmN0dm5ld3MuY2EvY291bmNpbC10ZWFycy1zdHJpcC1vZmYtY2l0eS1hZG1pbi1vdmVyLWRlbGF5ZWQtbWV0cm8tbHJ0LWxpbmUtMS4yNDU4Njg5P2NhY2hlPXllcyUyRjUtdGhpbmdzLXRvLWtub3ctZm9yLWZyaWRheS1hdWd1c3QtMTYtMjAxOS0xLjQ1NTI0NDbSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Edmonton’s City Council had harsh words for administrators Tuesday, reprimanding them for leaving Council in the dark about problems with the Metro LRT Line.

In Council chambers Tuesday, it was clear Councillors’ patience is wearing thin over the long-awaited and seriously delayed transit line.

“I’m still furious, frankly that project is dragging on so long,” Mayor Don Iveson said.

A report leaked to the Edmonton Journal outlined issues councillors were not told about – and it had many calling City transparency and credibility into question.

“The public trust is gone, it’s down the toilet, it’s been flushed away,” Councillor Mike Nickel said.

On Tuesday, an update on the project – Transportation General Manager said the City has tried to open the line three times since the end of May, including Sunday, July 5.

However, each time there were issues – the delays have left councillors skeptical over a new deadline. It’s hoped it will open before the new school year in the fall, but no date has been set.

Meanwhile, City officials and the contractor, Thales Group, were pointing fingers at eachother – the City placing blame on Thales, and the company saying the trains are ready to run.

“We selected world class vendors and unfortunately they have been unable to deliver for us,” Transportation General Manager Dorian Wandzura said – officials said Thales was solely responsible for the delays.

However, in a statement to CTV News, Thales said the company is completing “small activities” but the trains are “capable of running with passengers”.

Now, Council is left with a major decision.

“Council has to make a determination at some time here whether the risk of it taking somewhat longer to complete with this contract exceeds the risk of starting from scratch,” Iveson said.

Staff said Thales’ work on the Metro Line could affect whether the company could work on future projects – including the Valley LRT Line.

Also Tuesday, Iveson asked that regular, public updates on the line be issued, until the LRT line opens.

Malaysia buys Starstreak Missile from UK - UK Defence Journal,"Fri, 31 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vdWtkZWZlbmNlam91cm5hbC5vcmcudWsvbWFsYXlzaWEtYnV5cy1zdGFyc3RyZWFrLW1pc3NpbGUtZnJvbS11ay_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Malaysia has signed a deal for the procurement of the Thales Starstreak missiles.

Starstreak is a British short range anti-air missile manufactured by Thales, in Belfast. Starstreak has been in service with the British Army since 1997. In 2012 Thales rebranded the system under the ForceShield banner.

In 2012, the UK Ministry of Defence announced that it would be placing a Starstreak detachment on top of a block of flats in London in preparation for the 2012 London Olympics. The Ministry claimed that the area was the only suitable location for an air defence detachment of the type. Some residents were upset and uncertain of the necessity of the detachment. In 2013, the MoD ordered 200 more Starstreak missiles.

Global Komited, a subsidiary of Weststar Group and Thales signed the agreement to market the Starstreak system to the Malaysian Armed Forces in 2014.

The Starstreak will replace the Thales Starbust V-Shorads which had been used in the air defence of military bases in the country.

"ADF set for 30,000 EF88 rifles - The Firearm Blog","Wed, 08 Jul 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZpcmVhcm1ibG9nLmNvbS9ibG9nLzIwMTUvMDcvMDgvYXVzdHJhbGlhLXNpZ24tbmV3LWVmODgtY29udHJhY3Qv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Jane’s has come out with a report that Australia is in the final stages of procurement of the EF88 5.56x45mm service rifle, or the “Enhanced F88”. Currently, the Australian Defense Force (ADF) has just over 80,000 servicemen and women. With this contract of 30,000 rifles, it appears that all are probably going to the Infantry as it won’t cover the entire force.

The Australian Defence Force (ADF) will begin taking delivery in 2016 of about 30,000 new EF88 Austeyr 5.56 mm rifles under an AUD100 million (USD75 million) contract to be signed later this month, a Department of Defence (DoD) spokesman confirmed toIHS Jane’s on 7 July.

The contract, to be signed with Thales Australia, follows second pass approval announced on 6 July by Defence Minister Kevin Andrews for expenditure of AUD467 million under Project Land 125 Phase 5C.

….

The DoD spokesman said the Thales contract would be signed before the end of July for “about” 30,000 EF88s.

First deliveries under the new contract would take place in 2016, although some EF88s from low-rate initial production approved by the government in September 2014 had already been received for derisking activities.

The balance of the approved expenditure would be applied to the acquisition of a broad range of targeting and surveillance ancillaries for the EF88, solicitation for which was already under way."
