"Thales Alenia Space, Telespazio To Build Sicral 2 Satellite - SpaceNews","Fri, 07 May 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS90aGFsZXMtYWxlbmlhLXNwYWNlLXRlbGVzcGF6aW8tYnVpbGQtc2ljcmFsLTItc2F0ZWxsaXRlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Satellite builder Thales Alenia Space and ground-services provider Telespazio will build the Sicral 2 military telecommunications satellite system for the Italian and French defense ministries under a contract valued at 295 million euros ($376 million), the two companies announced May 7.

Sicral 2, carrying separate UHF- and SHF-frequency payloads for France and Italy, is being financed as part of a government-industry partnership that expects complete negotiations for a bank loan in June. Sicral 2 is scheduled for launch in 2013, with a launch-services provider to be selected under a separate contract.

In a May 7 interview, the chief executive of Thales Alenia Space Italia, Luigi Pasquali, said the Italian government is guaranteeing a bank loan to be taken out by the industrial consortium to build Sicral 2. The contract amount, he said, includes an estimated cost of the launch vehicle that will be adjusted once the launch-services contract is signed.

Government and industry officials in France and Italy have been saying for more than two years that Sicral 2 represents a milestone in European military space collaboration. The contract was signed April 30.

Whether Sicral 2 will serve as a template for further cross-border efforts in Earth observation, missile warning or telecommunications remains unclear, especially given how long it took both nations to come to terms on the contract once they had agreed on the joint project.

The bilateral effort was made easier by the joint French-Italian ownership of the industrial contracting team. Thales Group of France and Finmeccanica of Italy together own Thales Alenia Space, based in Cannes, France. They also co-own Rome-based Telespazio.

France and Italy agreed earlier this year to the joint construction of a satellite using the military-assigned portion of Ka-band spectrum for a broadband satellite, called Athena-Fidus, to serve both nations’ military and civil-security forces.

But Sicral 2 represents a clear break from the past in Europe. Currently, France, Italy, Britain, Spain and Germany have their own, independent military telecommunications satellite systems.

France, Italy and Britain are jointly providing satellite telecommunications capacity to the NATO alliance under a contract they won together. Sicral 2 will reinforce Italy’s ability to provide its planned UHF bandwidth to NATO beyond what is available on the Italian Sicral 1 and Sicral 1b satellites, both in orbit.

Sicral 2 also will add to France’s two-satellite Syracuse 3 system.

“The industrial team that you see in the contract was established some time ago, so it was not on the industry side that the contract was delayed,” Pasquali said. “The delaying factor, in addition to the economic crisis that we all know about, was the fact that we have two sovereign nations that have to determine, in detail, how to use a single satellite. This took some time.”

Pasquali said that, for now, no portion of the Sicral 2 payload has been reserved for private-sector sale to third parties. Telespazio, in return for its investment in the Sicral 1B satellite, has rights to a portion of the Sicral 1B capacity.

But Pasquali said the Italian government has not closed the door to a possible privatization of a part of Italy’s Sicral 2 payload.

Italian defense officials had hoped to place Sicral 2 in orbit in 2012 to replace the aging Sicral 1 satellite, which has lost part of its capacity. Sicral 1’s performance has forced Italy to rely more heavily than planned on Sicral 1B. By 2013, Sicral 1 will have surpassed its contractual service life.

Sicral 2, a Thales Alenia Space Spacebus 4000 platform, is expected to weigh around 4,000 kilograms at launch. It will operate in geostationary orbit at 37 degrees east longitude.

The Thales Alenia Space share of the contract will total about 193 million euros. The company will build the Italian UHF and French SHF electronics payloads, serve as prime contractor for the satellite, and design the ground segment. Telespazio’s share of the contract, valued at 102 million euros, will include early in-orbit control and testing of the satellite, and management of the construction of the ground network."
Taiwan wins Lafayette court case - 台北時報,"Wed, 05 May 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhaXBlaXRpbWVzLmNvbS9OZXdzL2Zyb250L2FyY2hpdmVzLzIwMTAvMDUvMDUvMjAwMzQ3MjIzMtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Taiwan wins Lafayette court case

REPARATIONS French company Thales has been ordered to repay about US$861 million to make up for illegal commissions which helped the firm win the frigate deal

By Rich Chang and Ko Shu-ling / STAFF REPORTERS





The Ministry of National Defense (MND) yesterday confirmed reports that it had won the case it filed with the international commercial arbitration court in the scandal-plagued Lafayette frigate deal. The French company Thales has been ordered to repay Taiwan’s government around US$861 million.

In the ruling on Monday, the Paris-based court said the money was to make up for unauthorized commissions that had been paid to help Thomson-CSF (now known as Thales) win a deal to sell six Lafayette frigates to Taiwan for US$2.5 billion in 1991.

The Navy filed the arbitration petition with the court in 2001, requesting the repayment of US$520 million in unlawful kickbacks from Thales.

Deputy Minister of National Defense Chao Shih-chang (趙世璋) told a press conference yesterday that the ministry hoped that Thales would now repay the money and if the company refused, the Navy would apply to the French court for compulsory enforcement.

Navy attorney Vivian Lee (李孟融) told the press conference that the court ruled that Thales repay US$591 million in unlawful kickbacks, US$250 million in interest and US$20 million in legal expenses, totaling US$861 million.

The ruling was final, she said.

“Thales has been ordered to pay damages and interest,” a company spokesman said, adding that the group was “contesting the very basis of this ruling” and would appeal.

Under Article 18 of the contract, the French company was prohibited from paying any kind of commission and it was stipulated that any illicit commissions would have to be repaid to Taiwan.

The contract also said that any dispute would be settled by a panel of arbitrators.

Prosecutor-General Huang Shih-ming (黃世銘) said Taiwanese prosecutors have not yet completed their investigations into the Lafayette case and they would continue to look into any involvement of former government officials and politicians in the case.

Taiwanese investigators said Thompson-CSF paid US$495 million to Andrew Wang (汪傳浦) and US$25 million to Alfred Sirven, a former vice chairman of the French oil firm Elf-Aquitaine. Sirven is alleged to have played the role of money launderer and allocator of the kickbacks in the transaction.

Wang fled Taiwan in late 1993 following the death of Navy Captain Yin Ching-feng (尹清楓), whose body was found in the sea off the east coast of Taiwan.

Yin is believed to have been ready to blow the whistle on colleagues who had allegedly received kickbacks from the Lafayette deal.

Wang has been wanted in connection with Yin’s death since September 2000.

A French judicial probe opened in 2001 to investigate claims that much of the money paid by Taiwan a decade earlier went toward commissions to middlemen, politicians and military officers in Taiwan, China and France.

In 2001, the Control Yuan ruled that as much as US$400 million in kickbacks may have been paid over the course of the deal.

Thales spearheaded the sale, but the main stake in the contract was held by the French state-owned shipbuilder DCN. Several sources said the French state would have to pay 70 percent of the penalty.

President Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九) expressed gratification over the ruling.

Presidential Office Spokesman Lo Chih-chiang (羅智強) said Ma’s position on the matter was clear and that he supported the ministry’s position that the case should not be settled out of court.

Lo said the legal triumph strengthened the administration’s resolve to build a clean government and military.

Lo declined to comment on whether Ma would accept an offer by the French government to exchange the compensation for the upgrade of existing munitions or additional weaponry, saying it was a hypothetical question.

At a press conference held by the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) caucus, KMT Legislator Lin Yu-fang (林郁方) of the Foreign and National Defense Committee described the result as “belated justice.” Lin said he the nation should receive NT$40 billion in compensation rather than NT$20 billion as reported by the media.

Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislators said the ruling showed that military officials were also guilty in handing out and receiving kickbacks and asked the defense ministry to publish the names of those involved.

DPP Legislator Chai Trong-rong (蔡同榮) asked the government to redouble its efforts in tracking down escaped fugitive arms dealer Wang, the key suspect in the kickback scandal.

Wang — who also holds a Dominican Republic passport — is ranked No. 4 on a list of Taiwan’s most wanted.

Thales and France fined $830m for Taiwan navy deal - CBBC Newsround,"Mon, 03 May 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHA6Ly9uZXdzLmJiYy5jby51ay8yL2hpL2FzaWEtcGFjaWZpYy84NjU4Nzg5LnN0bdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Frence's government played a crucial role in negotiating the deal with Taiwan

An international court has ordered France and defence electronics group Thales to pay $830m in compensation to Taiwan over a sale of warships in 1991.

The panel of arbitrators ordered the payments to make up for unauthorised commissions paid to help Thomson-CSF, which became Thales, win the deal.

The contract for the six navy frigates forbade commissions to intermediaries.

Thales said its share of the fine was about 27% or $230m, but says that it will appeal against the ruling.

The company, which is part-owned by the French state, said it disputed ""the very grounds of this decision"" by the International Chamber of Commerce's International Court of Arbitration.

It had been responsible for 27% of the value of the contract, while the French state had been responsible for the remainder.

The French ministry of defence declined to comment.

The suspicious death of a Taiwanese navy captain triggered an investigation

In the deal, in which the French government played a crucial role, Taiwan's navy bought six Lafayette frigates from Thomson-CSF and the state-owned shipbuilder DCN for $460m each, nearly double the original budget.

The suspicious death of the head of procurement for the Taiwanese navy, Captain Yin Ching-feng, who was found floating off the coast of Taiwan in 1993, eventually triggered a corruption investigation. Six former naval officers, including a vice-admiral, were later indicted in connection.

In 2001, the Taiwanese authorities filed a complaint alleging that the anti-corruption clauses in the contract had been breached.

French prosecutors investigated claims that bribes were paid in the deal, but they were unable to ascertain who might have benefited."
Proposed Thales closure 'will hit economy' in Wells - CBBC Newsround,"Thu, 27 May 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHA6Ly9uZXdzLmJiYy5jby51ay8yL2hpL3VrX25ld3MvZW5nbGFuZC9zb21lcnNldC84NzA4MDUyLnN0bdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A consultation with staff will begin at the end of May The mayor of Wells in Somerset has expressed concerns that the closure of a defence electronics company's factory will affect the local economy. On Wednesday Thales announced proposals to close its plant in the city by March 2011. It said the building was no longer fit for purpose. Councillor Tony Robbins said local taxi firms supplied transport for staff. ""There are the cafes, hotels and restaurants that people from Thales may well use,"" he added. ""All those small things put together make for quite a big hit on the economy for Wells."" Under the plans, some 300 staff will be transferred to the company's other Somerset plant at Templecombe. The other 300 will relocate to the Bristol or Basingstoke sites. A 90-day consultation will start on 31 May. The company manufactures software for the military and civilian market. 'Challenging time' A spokeswoman for Thales UK said the move was necessary to remain ""competitive and responsive to market demands"". She said: ""We understand that this is a challenging time, but our employees are our most important asset and are they are key to our success. ""It is crucial that we retain the considerable skills and experience of our people when moving forward. We are committed to supporting and consulting with our employees through these proposed changes."" Newly-elected Liberal Democrat MP Tessa Munt said: ""Although no redundancies are proposed... some people may face a drive of an extra 45 minutes, or an hour and 45 minutes to the sites in Templecombe and Basingstoke. ""This clearly would have a huge impact on anyone's lifestyle, and may make it impossible for some to take up this option. There will also be a knock on effect on anyone who works in cleaning, security and catering at the site.""
