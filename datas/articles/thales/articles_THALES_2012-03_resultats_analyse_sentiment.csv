Brandeis University professor Stephen G. Cecchetti has on his website posted a snip from his textbook on the origin of derivatives.

It includes the story of the first-ever options trade in recorded history:

In financial markets, the term ""derivatives"" is used to refer to a group of instruments that derive their value from some underlying commodity or market. Forwards, futures, swaps and options are all types of derivative instruments and are widely used for hedging or speculative purposes. While trading in derivative products has grown tremendously in recent times, early evidence of these types of instruments can be traced back to ancient Greece. Aristotle related a story about how the Greek philosopher Thales profited handsomely from an option-type agreement around the 6th century b.c. According to the story, one-year ahead, Thales forecast the next olive harvest would be an exceptionally good one. As a poor philosopher, he did not have many financial resources at hand. But he used what he had to place a deposit on the local olive presses. As nobody knew for certain whether the harvest would be good or bad, Thalus secured the rights to the presses at a relatively low rate. When the harvest proved to be bountiful, and so demand for the presses was high, Thalus charged a high price for their use and reaped a considerable profit.

A critical attribute of Thales's arrangement was the fact that its merit did not depend on his forecast for a good harvest being accurate. The deposit gave him the right but not the obligation to hire the presses. If the harvest had failed, his losses were limited to the initial deposit he paid. Thales had purchased an option.

Thales and Siemens have been awarded a contract…

Thales and Siemens announced today that they have been awarded a contract to provide a permanent communications-based train control (CBTC) test track facility for Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) New York City Transit (NYCT). The test facility, to be installed on an express track of the subway system’s Culver line, will offer a controlled environment for NYCT CBTC equipment scenario trials and assessment. The 4-year contract is valued at over $60 million (around €45 million).

CBTC technology manages all train movements and signaling, safely reducing the amount of headway required between trains. This enables an operator to increase the number of trains running on a line, providing daily riders with a safer, more comfortable and less crowded daily commute.

Under this contract, Thales and Siemens will work together to provide NYCT with a set of specifications, which will be used as a standard for NYCT’s future CBTC projects. The two companies will create a fully operational test track that will be used by NYCT to test and validate the interoperability of CBTC equipment from any supplier that complies with these published specifications.

“Thales is proud to be selected, with Siemens, to deliver this important project for the NYCT,” said Allan Cameron, president and CEO of Thales USA. “The establishment of the Culver test track will provide an important validation and risk mitigation tool for NYCT as it rolls out its long-term CBTC interoperability program.”

“We achieved a major milestone with the successful deployment of CBTC in revenue service on the Canarsie line, and are pleased to be once again working with NYCT on the deployment of this technology, ” said Gert Seidel, vice president and general manager, Siemens Rail Automation business in the United States. “We look forward to partnering with Thales to provide NYCT with technology that will improve the travel experience of its passengers.”

The test track will be established on NYCT’s Culver Line, also known as the F-Line. When not in use for CBTC testing, the test track will support unequipped revenue service.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9804176092147827}",neutral,0.9804176092147827,0
Thales to install surveillance radar and air traffic control equipment at Turkmenistan's Ashgabat Airport - Military & Aerospace Electronics,"Sun, 25 Mar 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5taWxpdGFyeWFlcm9zcGFjZS5jb20vY29tbWVyY2lhbC1hZXJvc3BhY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS8xNDIyNjA5My90aGFsZXMtdG8taW5zdGFsbC1zdXJ2ZWlsbGFuY2UtcmFkYXItYW5kLWFpci10cmFmZmljLWNvbnRyb2wtZXF1aXBtZW50LWF0LXR1cmttZW5pc3RhbnMtYXNoZ2FiYXQtYWlycG9ydNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NEUILLY-SUR-SEINE, France, 25 March 2012.Air traffic control (ATC) experts at the Thales Group in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, are installing an air traffic management (ATM) system at Ashgabat Airport -- one of two international airports in Turkmenistan -- under terms of a contract awarded to Thales by the TURKMENHOWAYOLLARY State Civil Aviation Department (SCAD) in Turkmenistan.

Thales will build and install the company's latest-generation TopSky ATM system and the STAR 2000 S-band primary airport surveillance radar co-mounted with a secondary RSM970S mode S radar at Turkmenistan's Ashgabat Airport. The TopSky equipment will control aircraft operating at Ashgabat Airport through departure, en-route, and approach phases, Thales officials say. No dollar amount of the contract was released.

Thales engineers also will integrated communications, navigation and surveillance (CNS) equipment at Ashgabat Airport, as well as provide operator training, in an effort to modernize the airport's existing navigation, surveillance, and ATM capabilities.

The STAR 2000 is a primary surveillance radar for approach and extended approach control area. The radar system has a range of 60 to 100 nautical miles, solid-state design, and can be installed with multimode surveillance capability such as ADS-B or multilateration.

Ashgabat Airport is about six miles northwest of the Turkmenistan capital Ashgabat. The airport has an air traffic control tower and three runways, including 12L/30R, which is a 12,467-foot precision-approach runway -- slightly longer than the longest runway at Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Atlanta.

Ashgabat's other two runways are the 5,907-foot 11/29, and the 9,806-foot 12R/30L. All runways are paved, but the shortest runway, 11/29, is not lighted.

Thales introduces TopSky ATM equipment this month, which is new branding for all Thales Eurocat, Simcat, Flowcat, aeronautical information management and integrated tower products. This change of name reflects a 10-year vision of Thales executives for their company's automation equipment.

IN FOCUS: Thales looks to 'gesture control' IFE system - Flightglobal,"Mon, 19 Mar 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vaW4tZm9jdXMtdGhhbGVzLWxvb2tzLXRvLWdlc3R1cmUtY29udHJvbC1pZmUtc3lzdGVtLzEwNDQyOS5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In-flight entertainment (IFE) systems will soon do away with touchscreens and handsets if a prototype under development by Thales makes it through to production.

Looking like the webcam built into most of today's laptop screens, an infrared camera linked to the standard seatback screen is capable of reading a passenger's hand gestures to select IFE content and even control games. For passengers, the trick is to imagine a touchscreen hovering in mid-air at chest level.

Brett Bleacher, director of hardware advanced technologies at Thales Avionics in Irvine, California, says the goal is to enhance the IFE experience, so games will be developed to exploit the feel of the hand-gesture technology.

For airlines, the concept offers several key benefits, says Bleacher. First, touchscreens are expensive and suffer a lot of wear and tear, so a simple infrared camera - which in the future may be replaced by an even cheaper webcam - should cut costs. And as the entire IFE delivery system resides in the seatback installation, costs and overall maintenance are cut, and upgrades are simplified.

Another attraction is that aviation-grade seatback touchscreens are particularly expensive to certificate. Adhesives needed to laminate the control surfaces pose challenges around fire and head impacts.

Also, eliminating the touchscreen, or other manual controller, cuts the risk of disease transmission, which should make the technology attractive in other markets, ranging from medical applications to automated teller machines.

Gesture control is a fifth-generation feature for Thales' Avant system. The fourth generation, including Android-technology touchscreen handsets, will enter service in all classes on Qatar Airways Boeing 787s by year-end.

Bleacher says the gesture version, shown at a Thales technology exhibition in Paris in February and set to feature at the company's Hamburg interiors show display, is three years away from commercial readiness. But several airlines are showing interest, says Bleacher, and with a commitment, Thales could mobilise enough development resources to have the system flying in 18 months.

A sixth-generation system, he says, will go beyond hand gestures to use eyeball-tracking cameras for control. That technology already exists, but ""we like to move forward in steps"", he observes.

The selection of Android technology for handsets makes the Avant IFE system perform like the mobile smartphones with which so many customers are familiar. Using this open-source software platform also helps designers at Thales to devise IFE systems that are compatible with the personal handheld devices passengers increasingly expect to use on board aircraft.

The platform supports, for example, seat-to-seat communications, or even Skype conversations with people on the ground.

MSG-3 satellite ready to continue weather-monitoring service - Phys.org,"Thu, 08 Mar 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vcGh5cy5vcmcvbmV3cy8yMDEyLTAzLW1zZy1zYXRlbGxpdGUtcmVhZHktd2VhdGhlci1tb25pdG9yaW5nLmh0bWzSAUhodHRwczovL3BoeXMub3JnL25ld3MvMjAxMi0wMy1tc2ctc2F0ZWxsaXRlLXJlYWR5LXdlYXRoZXItbW9uaXRvcmluZy5hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The third Meteosat Second Generation satellite, MSG-3, in the cleanroom at Thales Alenia Space in Cannes, France.

(PhysOrg.com) -- International partners are looking ahead to the newest member in a series of weather satellites that deliver images to European forecasters: MSG-3 is set for launch this summer.

The Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellites are designed to improve weather prediction.

The first in the series, MSG-1 – also known as Meteosat-8 – was launched in 2002. MSG-2 followed three years later. Both have been successful in continuing the legacy of the operational meteorological satellites that started with Meteosat-1 in 1977.

The MSGs offer more spectral channels and are sensing Earth at a higher resolution than the previous Meteosat satellites.

The series returns highly detailed imagery of Europe, the North Atlantic and Africa every 15 minutes for use by meteorologists and national weather forecasters.

To guarantee the continuity of service, the third in a planned series of four satellites is on track for launch in June.

Shortly after liftoff from Kourou, French Guiana, it will be injected into geostationary orbit at an altitude of 36 000 km over the equator.

ESA has developed the satellites in close cooperation with Eumetsat – the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites – and is responsible for the complex launch and early orbit phase. About ten days after launch, Eumetsat will take over routine operations.

Along with keeping track of cloud development and temperature to improve weather forecasting accuracy, MSG-3 has two secondary missions in the areas of radiation and rescue.

The Global Earth Radiation Budget payload measures energy radiated by Earth. This radiation balance across day and night gives insight into atmosphere circulation and energy distribution.

Meanwhile, the Search and Rescue transponder receives and relays distress signals from beacons within its field of view.

On Wednesday, MSG-3 builder Thales Alenia Space hosted a media event in Cannes, France.

Director of ESA’s Earth Observation Programmes, Volker Liebig outlined the innovations that the mission has made in weather monitoring.

“The latest MSG satellite will continue to deliver precise data in a wide range of spectral bands to ensure high accuracy in weather forecasting in the years to come, and keep close track on cloud development,” said Prof. Liebig.

The Eumetsat Director-General, Alain Ratier, spoke about the success of the first two MSGs and the importance of continuing Meteosat’s vital services, while Eumetsat Meteorological Scientist Philip Watts detailed how MSG-3 observes Earth’s atmosphere and surface.

The Director of Optical Observation & Science for Thales Alenia Space, Jean-Jacques Juillet, also presented on how the MSG satellites are built and how extensive tests ensure reliable operations in the years to come.

The presentations were followed by a visit to Thales Alenia Space’s cleanroom, where the satellite is currently being held.

Last month, MSG-3 underwent an intensive, two-day test to validate the full set of flight procedures such as receiving commands and delivering data.

During a simulation campaign this month, engineers will train the mission control teams, particularly on how to solve contingency situations if anything goes wrong.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9985306262969971}",neutral,0.9985306262969971,0
An Inside Look at Boeing”s 787 Dreamliner Flight Simulator - Airline Reporter,"Fri, 30 Mar 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmxpbmVyZXBvcnRlci5jb20vMjAxMi8wMy9hbi1pbnNpZGUtbG9vay1hdC1ib2VpbmdzLTc4Ny1kcmVhbWxpbmVyLWZsaWdodC1zaW11bGF0b3Iv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing Flight Services (BFS) offers eight locations around the world that provides pilot, maintenance, composite and cabin crew training. Around the world, Boeing offers 80 flight simulators (eight are for the 787). The locations for the 787 training facilities are located in London, Singapore, Shanghai, Tokyo and of course Seattle. We recently had the opportunity to take a behind the scenes look at the pilot training part of the BFS facility located south of Seattle,WA.

Currently, Boeing has orders for 873 787 Dreamliners. For each new aircraft that gets delivered, there need to be pilots, technicians and flight crew that require training. Boeing works with their airline customers to provide a customized training package. They can choose to have their entire staff trained, or just a handful of trainers who return to the carrier armed with all the knowledge they need.

How long it takes for a new pilot to be trained on the 787 depends on their previous experience. Since the 777 and 787 cockpits are so similar, it only takes pilots five days to be trained on the Dreamliner. A pilot who has flown other Boeing products (like the 767 or 737), it can take 13 days and if a pilot has never flown a Boeing product, it takes 20 days.

The section of the facility we visited held four simulators: two for the 787, one for the 737 and one for the 767. Before getting into full simulator, pilots will start out on a desktop simulation, which students are able to view a 3-D virtual 787 to learn about the aircraft before taking the controls.

Next, pilots move to the flight training device that looks like a desk-mounted simulator and lets the flight crew become familiar with the instruments and airplane systems better before hitting the fully operation simulator.

Before each flight in the full simulator, pilots will sit down with their Boeing instructor to go over the details and expectations of the flight. Boeing flight instructors, on average, have 15,700 total time and at minimum, they are required to have at least 5,000 hours with 1,000 of those in training.

Pilots normally fly for four hours in the simulator and afterwards, trainers will go step-by-step with the pilots using playback from the simulator.

When entering the simulator, the first thing that stands out is the large chair in the middle of everything. The chair appears more at home on the bridge of the Starship Enterprise than the simulator we’re standing in. The chair, affectionately called ’œCaptain Kirk’s Seat’, is where the instructor is direct and manage the simulation along with being able to see the same visualization that the pilots are.

Due to the number of media on the tour the full motion capability was switched off, but that did not stop from making the experience enjoyable. Flight instructor Captain Greg Beard pressed a few buttons on the trainer chair and everyone was whisked away at the speed of light to Narita International Airport in Tokyo. Capt. Beard sat in the co-pilot seat as he smoothly took off the Dreamliner to take a tour around Tokyo.

Being in a few 787 cockpits (not during flight), it is easy to say that the simulator is very accurate to the actual Dreamliner. Beard confirmed this by explaining that all the same software and options on the actual aircraft are in the simulator ’“ actually there are more. The simulator can be programed to have either the GEnx engines or RR Trent 1000 (there are few differences in the flight deck of the two). The simulator can also be used for the future 787-9 model as well.

Although the Boeing 787 is a complex machine, it has been built to make flying as easy as possible. It is not cheap to purchase your own 787 simulators. They are manufactured by Thales, cost about $15-$18million each.
