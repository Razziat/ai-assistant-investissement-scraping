The first #ThalesMediaDays, organised April 11, demonstrated the impact cybersecurity has on all of our daily lives, and showcased our pragmatic and robust solutions to this technological and societal challenge.



Challenges and solutions at #ThalesMediaDays

This event, organised for French and international media at the Thales Learning Hub in Vélizy near Paris on April 11, was the occasion to underline the position of the Group in the cybersecurity domain. With an investment of over a billion euros over the last three years in the four key digital technologies (Connectivity, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity), Thales also now confirms its role as a digital innovation lab and the world leader in cybersecurity.

The presentations by Marc Darmon, EVP, Secure Communications and Information Systems, Guillaume Poupard, the President of ANSSI (the National Cybersecurity Agency of France) as well as the conclusion by Patrice Caine, Thales Chairman & CEO, gave participants a very clear picture of the issues at stake.



Our clients have big ambitions and operate mission critical systems, where safety and security have to be assured at the highest levels, in real time, be it in air traffic management, train signaling, satellite communications or air defence systems, where human life is often at stake. That’s why cybersecurity is the sine qua non condition of our digital technologies. As the world becomes more connected, it also becomes more vulnerable.”

Patrice Caine, Chairman & CEO, Thales

If digital transformation is bringing opportunities for growth, new revenue streams, new services and new business models in almost every industry, everywhere, a more connected world is also one that becomes more vulnerable to attacks.

Experts from Thales and other companies and organisations discussed cyber training, the detection of attacks in real time, cloud encryption and data protection, protecting airports, key developments in the automative industry, and cybersecuring air traffic management, as well as the theoretical hacking of connected aircraft, satellites and autonomous cars, the role played by Big Data and Artificial Intelligence in cybersecurity, the cyber protection of armies and even how we can – and must - read hackers’ minds.



This summer, Thales will open a cybersecurity hub in Dubai to serve as a centre of excellence for Cyber Consulting services in the Middle East.

Thales aims for market segmentation with three IFE systems - Runway Girl Network,"Thu, 12 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTgvMDQvdGhhbGVzLWFpbXMtZm9yLW1hcmtldC1zZWdtZW50YXRpb24td2l0aC10aHJlZS1pZmUtc3lzdGVtcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Expanding its inflight entertainment product range in order to segment its market, Thales is now offering two IFE system types that bracket the Avant system seen on a number of airlines. A slimmed-down version called Core and a beefed-up system named Prestige are aimed at airlines with different levels of expertise and desire to be engaged with the process.

“On the aircraft, we have three offerings now,” Dominique Giannoni, chief executive of Thales’ Inflyt Experience IFE business, tells Runway Girl Network. “One is called Core, sharing the same architecture and hardware as Avant, but it’s the streamlined configuration. It’s designed to go fast to market, and with less interaction with an airline.”

Giannoni referred to Core as “prêt à porter”, ready-to-wear, with Prestige as “haute couture”. He and his Thales colleagues were amused when RGN suggested that Avant might be, therefore, “department store”.

For Core, Giannoni says, “We’ve found out that many airlines want to know: “what is your configuration? What do you propose?” On the hardware side and the GUI, named Select, we’ve worked with the Native design agency in order to prepare a preconfigured configuration. It is straightforward and cost effective.”

Giannoni and his Thales colleagues confirm to RGN that, while functionality (tiling, colour, and so on) will be customisable, fonts and other choices will not. “What we have streamlined is the configuration an airline can choose from.

You will see the specific user experience side: we’ve worked on designing building blocks that the airline can assemble, but really we are driving the process. The advantage for the airline is this is all configured by content, so it is very streamlined.”

From an airline resourcing perspective, “it is a very straightforward interaction, so you don’t need a lot of people to work on it. It is not a lengthy process,” Giannoni notes. “You can change it quite often because it’s content-driven. It’s really a cost-effective system and way of working.”

Core is, in essence, the out-of-the box solution. “Then we still have Avant, where you have a bit more flexibility, passenger control units, you can work on designing the UI,” Giannoni says. Thales notes that Avant is flying on more than 500 aircraft.

So, is Core a slimmed down Avant or newly engineered? “It’s both. It’s built on the legacy of Avant,” Giannoni says.

Above Avant, for the airline that wants to customise every aspect of the experience — including, Thales communications exec Marie Remboulis tells RGN, the 2016 fifty 777X shipset order for Emirates — the company offers Prestige.

“Prestige is our brand new system,” Giannoni says. “It’s 4K, fully integrated, and it’s also a way to work with the airline that is like a co-development. We have a number of workshops: they have access to our digital factory in Thales. It’s really a partnership.”

The difference between the three, Giannoni says, is “a question of how we work with the airline. All of the three solutions, Core, Avant and Prestige, are powered by our digital platform, which is the ground platform Inflyt 360.”

Inflyt 360 is “the place where we are collecting and processing all the data we get from the aircraft or from other sources. We prepare personalisation, targeting ads, monetisation and all the content processing, and then we push to the aircraft,” Giannoni explains.

In architecture terms, Core and Avant are the same, Giannoni confirms. Prestige, meanwhile, comes with a 10 Gbps backbone as a new platform conforming to Boeing’s planned standard for the 777X.

Core and Avant, it’s the same architecture. With Prestige, it’s a 10 gig backbone, because it’s a new platform.

APEX Insight: Thales InFlyt 360, introduced at AIX last year, showed Thales’ vision to enhance its Avant in-flight entertainment and connectivity system with a digital experience to surprise and engage passengers. Today, the avionics company has announced Core and Prestige, the fruits of that vision.

Thales today introduced Core and Prestige, two packaged in-flight entertainment and connectivity (IFEC) solutions designed to cater to different airline market segments, based on its Avant IFEC system and are part of the Thales InFlyt 360 vision, which was introduced by the avionics company at last year’s Aircraft Interiors Expo. “The idea is to cover the whole span of our customers,” said Richard Perrot, vice-president, Marketing and Product Policy, Thales InFlyt Experience. “We did a tremendous study to better identify the market segments our customers belong to.”

“We did a tremendous study to better identify the market segments our customers belong to.” – Richard Perrot, Thales InFlyt Experience

With IAG Group launching Level and Air France coming out with Joon, Dominique Giannoni, CEO, Thales InFlyt Experience, says airlines are extending their mainline brands and looking at the passenger experience differently, so they are, too. “We want to address this differently also,” he said.

Core, as the product name suggests, is a turnkey solution that offers the essentials of an IFEC platform, offering content, targeted advertising and shopping. These features will be available to passengers through Select, Thales’ latest generation graphic user interface (GUI), which was developed in partnership with design agency Native, after a survey of consumer websites.

“We’re targeting customers that want an IFE solution that’s efficient, very affordable and ready for revenue generation, which could ultimately reduce the initial costs for the airline,” said Perrot. And since most of Core’s GUI elements are fixed, no additional software development will be required, allowing for a shorter lead time to deploy the system.

On the opposite end of the spectrum is Prestige, which is meant to serve airlines that want to make a statement with their brand by offering the newest technology and devices. Prestige customers will be able to completely customize the IFEC experience by leveraging airline customer data such as age, nationality and airline history so that no two passengers see the same screen, for example.

Customers will have the entire gamut of Thales’ facilities and resources, including experts at its User Experience Center of Excellence in Irvine, California; Digital Factory in Paris; and cybersecurity centre in Orlando, Florida available to them.

“We are completely renewing and reshaping our entire offer by focusing on what our customer wants to achieve and the IFEC experience they envisage on board and want to deliver to the passenger,” Perrot said."
"Eutelsat ditches ViaSat-3 investment, buys half-terabit satellite from Thales Alenia Space - SpaceNews","Thu, 05 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9ldXRlbHNhdC1kaXRjaGVzLXZpYXNhdC0zLWludmVzdG1lbnQtYnV5cy1oYWxmLXRlcmFiaXQtc2F0ZWxsaXRlLWZyb20tdGhhbGVzLWFsZW5pYS1zcGFjZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — Global fleet operator Eutelsat, after months of protracted negotiations with partner Viasat, on April 5 said it would go it alone on a powerful new satellite instead of investing in Viasat’s second ViaSat-3 satellite.

Thales Alenia Space is instead building a “VHTS” or Very High Throughput Satellite for Eutelsat called Konnect VHTS, bringing 500 Gigabits-per-second of Ka-band capacity to European markets. The European manufacturer is also building the accompanying ground segment.

Eutelsat’s decision to forgo an investment in a 1 terabit-per-second ViaSat-3 satellite with coverage of Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), comes after months of back and forth discussions with Carlsbad, California-based Viasat meant to iron out the details of a broadband joint venture the two operators started last year. Rodolphe Belmer, Eutelsat’s CEO, said in October that arduous but good-spirited negotiations were continuing over the framework of the ViaSat-3 EMEA satellite. Those negotiations were expected to conclude last year, but dragged on into this year. Viasat CEO Mark Dankberg told SpaceNews in March that determining which operator would claim revenues from respective customers was at the crux of the debate.

It is not immediately clear what the full impact Eutelsat’s Konnect VHTS purchase will have on the joint venture. Eutelsat was co-financing ViaSat-3 EMEA, having earmarked a 132.5 million euro ($162 million) investment Viasat made to obtain a 49 percent stake in Eutelsat’s seven-year-old KA-SAT broadband satellite. Eutelsat was going to reinvest that money back into ViaSat-3 EMEA, but that is no longer the case.

Eutelsat spokeswoman Marie-Sophie Ecuer told SpaceNews the joint venture “will continue to operate on KA-SAT for the foreseeable future.”

“Eutelsat has a right to make the Konnect VHTS investment outside of the joint venture, so there is no direct impact on the Viasat joint venture,” she said.

Eutelsat said Konnect VHTS will have “the most powerful on-board digital processor ever put in orbit, offering capacity allocation flexibility, optimal spectrum use, and progressive ground network deployment.” Though only half the capacity of a ViaSat-3 satellite, Konnect VHTS is more geographically concentrated, focusing only on Europe instead of a third of the planet.

Konnect VHTS is still one of the highest capacity satellites ever announced, on par with Hughes’ 500-Gbps Jupiter-3 satellite Space Systems Loral is building for broadband in North America. The Konnect VHTS satellite has a mass of 6,300 kilograms, and is scheduled to enter service in 2021. Eutelsat has not yet announced a launch provider for the satellite.

In a statement, Thales CEO Patrice Caine said Konnect VHTS will use an all-electric Spacebus NEO platform, leveraging investments from the European Space Agency, the French space agency CNES and France’s “Programme d’Investissements d’Avenir,” or “Investments for the Future Program.”

Two anchor customers, French telecom giant Orange and Thales’ connectivity division both agreed to multiyear capacity distribution contracts with the satellite. Orange will focus on fixed broadband in European countries where it has a retail presence, and Thales will serve the government market. Ecuer said the contracts derisk the satellite and are collectively worth “several hundred million euros.”

Eutelsat is adding substantial new capacity to the EMEA region through a lease on YahSat’s Al Yah 3 satellite, which is expected to reach its orbital slot in June. Another Eutelsat satellite under construction by Thales Alenia Space, the Africa Broadband Satellite (which Eutelsat is rebranding as “Konnect”), is scheduled to launch in 2019 with 75 Gbps of capacity distributed through 65 spot beams.

“High-speed broadband will be a critical driver of Eutelsat’s growth from 2020 onwards. Over the next decade, VHTS satellites will bring enough capacity to serve high speed internet and in-flight connectivity markets at scale, offering fiber-like services both in terms of price and speed,” Belmer said in a statement.

Eutelsat said the Konnect VHTS satellite fits within the company’s annual capital expenditure plan of 420 million euros."

VIDEOS: Massive French company Thales impresses with palace of decisive cyber security - iTWire,"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vaXR3aXJlLmNvbS9zZWN1cml0eS92aWRlb3MtbWFzc2l2ZS1mcmVuY2gtY29tcGFueS10aGFsZXMtaW1wcmVzc2VzLXdpdGgtdmlydHVhbC1wYWxhY2Utb2YtZGVjaXNpdmUtY3liZXJzZWN1cml0eS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales, whose name rhymes with Alice, is one of the world's biggest companies, with operations in aerospace, space, transportation, defence, and a major presence in cybersecurity.

Thales is a French multinational company that works across some of the world's most important industries, and has even had a footprint in Australia for decades, with this article covering Thales' first ever media day for journalists from around the world on its cyber security announcements.

This article features nine videos from the event, which are embedded at various points in the article below, which will illuminate the magnitude of Thales's operations.

The company works on huge projects of major significance with countries around the world, with a peek at its website and the constantly updated press release section just a glimpse into the wide variety of projects the company works on.

Just a handful of literally hundreds of illustrative examples are as follows:

Thales' work on a world-first air traffic control system it is developing with the Australian Government, not only giving visibility into 11% of the world's airspace, but able to track both civilian and military aircraft - for the first time , with more on the OneSKY air traffic control system here

Another example is of Thales' work with Transport for London's Tube system, whereby Thales late last month completed the ""biggest test yet of the new signalling system set to transform the Tube"".

Need more examples? Check out Thales' agreement with NASA for unmanned system control technologies, while marvelling at the fact Thales is the company that not only builds, but also launches, all those Iridium Next satellites going up into space, with 50 now already in orbit.

That doesn't even include Thales' offer to buy all of global digital security company Gemalto's shares at €51 per share, a deal expected to close later this year following the granting all of appropriate regulatory authorisations.

So, when Thales invited me to its demonstration of ""decisive cyber security moments at the heart of the daily life of civilians"" at its cyber security hub in Velizy Villacoublay, a mere eight kilometres from the world famous and stunningly impressive Palace of Versailles, the chance to explore the Thales palace of cyber security with its 2000 top-notch cyber security researchers and experts, in France alone (with 5000 globally), from around the world was a very welcome opportunity.

Here's an image of Thales in Cybersecurity – the article continues below, please read on:

You see, building such a wealth of talent, especially in the crucially vital area of cybersecurity is no mean feat, especially in a world of ever trickier cyber criminals and cyber crime, but when you have the will to become a global leader and the resources to do so, anything is possible.

Thus, you should not be surprised to learn that, over the past three years, Thales has invested over 1 billion euros in developing its expertise and footprint across four key digital technologies:

Connectivity

Big Data

Artificial Intelligence, and

Cybersecurity.

Impressively, Thales also notes that when it comes to AI, it is developing ""explainable AI"" that can clearly explain to human beings why it took a particular decision, which avoids the problem of ""black box technologies"" that want you to simply trust the algorithms are doing the right thing, when in the modern era, this simply isn't good enough for a world ever reliant on technology.

So, it is clear that these are some of the tech world's biggest challenges, and so it was that Thales proudly opened its doors to demonstrate, with concrete examples, how cyber security impacts the daily lives of enterprises, organisations and ultimately each citizen.

Here is the first video of the event, capturing the opening session of the day, with a cool video showing what might happen the day a major cyber attack hits a major country, and with an important speech from France's Head of National Cybersecurity Agency, Guillaume Poupard, as well as Thales senior executive Marc Darmon, and a smartphone hacking demonstration from two Ethical Hackers from Thales' stable of cyber security experts – the article continues below:

So, what were some of Thales' important developments in the cyber security sector?

The creation of a Cyber Hub in Dubai this summer: a centre of excellence for Cyber Consulting and services, it will accompany the Middle East, and in particular the UAE, with its extensive digital ambitions of becoming increasingly digitised across virtually all its major infrastructures.

Ten months after the opening of the first Thales Digital Factory in Paris, 150 world class experts have already developed 7 new products based on our 4 key digital technologies. Thales will further strengthen its Digital Factory based in Europe, Paris, with 50 new recruitments in 2018. The second area to host the digital factory will be North America with the opening of cortAIx this summer, a research hub in AI with 50 AI specialists, based in Canada, to inject AI in all Thales technologies. The third area, after Europe and the Americas, will be Asia, where Thales plans to launch a Digital Factory later this year.

Thales also has some key cybersecurity figures to share, which are as follows:

A total of €500 million in revenues for cyber security in 2017, with a growth expectation of 10% in 2018.

Thales runs operation and security of critical information systems for over 130 clients.

A total of 10,000 software developers and 5000 IT cyber engineers (globally).

Thales brings high grade security solutions for 50 countries including NATO.

Five cyber security operation centres.

Seven cyber security teams, three major data security hubs, five highly secured data centres in France.

In addition, Thales reports France deciding ""to rely on Thales for its digital transformation in a number of areas:""

A major programme to help structure the future of the French armed forces: together with partner Sopra Steria, Thales will compete in the first phase of the Artemis programme, a Big Data platform for the French Ministry of Armies.

Modernise and migrate IT networks towards Cloud-based and cyber secured solutions for the Ministry of Health and Solidarity and the Ministry of Labour.

France's National Institute of Geographic and Forest Information (IGN), under the Ministry for an Ecological and Solidary Transition and the Ministry of Agriculture and Food, will rely on Thales to migrate, secure and operate its Geoportal with 500 terabytes of data.

Here's Thales Media Days — Video 2 of 9 — Cyber security to manage and protect airports. The article continues below, please read on.

Then there's the automotive sector.

Here, Thales notes its offerings of ""real time cyber security to the Williams Formula 1 team"", while also noting its partnership with the team ""to work on the security of the intelligent connected vehicles"".

Thales states that it will be ""displaying the solution it supplies to the William’s formula 1 team at Vivatech in May"".

On top of this, Thales recently signed a partnership with Vector, a German specialist in automotive embedded electronics, to secure autonomous and connected cars.

So, especially in light of the ""explainable AI"" work that Thales is doing which we touched on above, how does Thales say that, in all of its markets, it adapts its solutions to new environment to always put data protection first?

In my mind, this this is something the tech world has clearly failed to do for decades, with Windows and the relative unreliability of computers and software putting software and auto-save capabilities last over the years, and which cloud solutions have gone some way to resolving.

That, however, is just one of my thoughts, with Thales' own description of how it adapts to putting data protection first as follows:

In multi-cloud environments, Thales offers encryption solution to help cloud services providers to secure their sensitive platforms or applications, such as Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft or SalesForce. With a management solution on key encryption, Thales allows them to directly control and manage the level of protection depending on the sensitivity of each data.

Thales is also proud to announce its partnership with Gibson Dunn, a leading law firm in Europe and the US. We will work together to provide holistic legal, technical and business advice for data protection to our clients.

Egypt's Cairo-Benha rail line to be modernised by Thales - Global Railway Review,"Mon, 23 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHJhaWx3YXlyZXZpZXcuY29tL25ld3MvNjg1MjUvY2Fpcm8tYmVuaGEtbW9kZXJuaXNlZC10aGFsZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Egypt’s Cairo-Benha rail line to be modernised by Thales

21 SHARES

Posted: 23 April 2018 | Global Railway Review |

As part of the railway modernisation contract for the Cairo-Alexandria line, Egypt National Railways (ENR) has selected Thales for the extension to modernise the Cairo-Benha section…

Thales has won a new extension to modernise the 48km Cairo-Benha within the Cairo-Alexandria line; doubling the section’s total average capacity for the transport of passengers and goods.

This project will improve traffic safety and security; allowing trains to travel at a speed of up to 160km/h compared to the current 120km/h. These changes will increase the capacity of transported passengers and goods on the backbone line that links the north and south of Egypt, from Alexandria-Cairo and all the way to Aswan.

The Cairo-Benha section consists of nine stations and 48km of track – carrying some of the busiest traffic on Egypt’s railway network. Onto it Thales will extend its signalling technologies that are currently being installed on the Benha-Alexandria section of the line. Modernised signalling technology along the entire Cairo-Alexandria corridor will ensure that every moment of operation can be captured.

This extension includes the supply of new signalling technologies such as nine electronic interlocking devices, 11 level crossings and field elements and the interface to existing assets. The contract also includes the overhaul of associated energy systems, refurbishment of existing technical buildings and construction of new ones in different locations. With this extension, the traffic control centre will be able to manage the whole line from Cairo to Alexandria.

Egyptian railways have embarked on an ambitious programme of railway modernisation with Thales involved from the start, first on the Cairo-Alexandria project and more recently with the signing of the contract for the modernisation of the signalling and telecom systems on the 180km section between Asyut and Nagh Hammadi in the Upper Egypt portion of the main Alexandria–Cairo–Aswan corridor."
Why having a philosopher in the office is good for business - Big Think,"Wed, 11 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL2JpZ3RoaW5rLmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LWlubm92YXRpb24vdGhlLXVuZXhhbWluZWQtYnVzaW5lc3MtaXMtbm90LXdvcnRoLWRvaW5nLXdoeS1oYXZpbmctYS1waGlsb3NvcGhlci1hdC10aGUtb2ZmaWNlLWlzLWEtZ29vZC1idXNpbmVzcy1jaG9pY2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"There is a story about Thales, the first philosopher, getting rich merely to prove that philosophers had business sense. The people of Miletus thought that philosophy was useless and asked him how he was still poor if he was so smart. He made a bet with them, saying he would be rich inside of a year. He proceeded to invent futures contracts and made a fortune in olive oil production.

Today, the stereotype of the philosopher who is wise but utterly useless in practical affairs endures. While some philosophers were rich, either by inheritance, lucky breaks, or rigging the lottery like Voltaire, the best-known philosophers were broke. What could a philosopher have to offer a modern business?

As it turns out, they have a lot to offer.

Google has its in-house philosopher Luciano Floridi and previously had Damon Horowitz in the same role. These philosophers ask the big questions that relate to the business operations of the company. “Should our search engine factor truth into the results?” is one such question. “How do we decide what that truth is?” is another. The resident philosopher also helps with more directly business-oriented questions of how to handle new regulations.

In Norway, social democratic and moralizing as it is, a philosopher helps to manage the Government Pension Fund. The Norwegian government had been debating how to properly invest the profits from the national oil company in a way that both assured financial security and moral responsibility for some time. They decided that the best way to guarantee both was to have a philosopher on hand to help with the ethical questions that would undoubtedly arise when businessmen tried to maximize profit.

While not every moral issue could be solved, the fund divested from arms manufacturers the army still had to make purchases from; the presence of a philosopher helped guide the process in a way that a room full of businesspeople alone could not have. The philosopher in question, Dr. Henrik Syse, continues to work in academia and remains a very public intellectual.

The idea of philosophy consultants isn’t limited to the strange lands of Silicon Valley or Scandinavia. Consulting firms which offer philosophic services for businesses can be found in many places. Organizations like the American Philosophical Practitioners Association offer to help companies ask the big questions and make choices that promote more than just short-term profit. Some of the more prominent names in business ethics have worked for the World Economic Forum and have helped to guide discussion on issues that shape the global economy.

But, why should businesses do this at all?

Scandinavia: home of lutefisk, perfect biking trails , and philosophers managing your pension fund. It might be utopia— or not

A boardroom filled with nothing but businesspeople might have a hard time trying to solve an ethical problem without unduly erring towards their profit. A philosopher in the room would at least give voice to ethical issues and concerns other than the maximization of income.

Similarly, groupthink, the phenomenon of otherwise rational groups making horrible decisions because nobody will stick their neck out, is a real and historically problematic thing which can be avoided by having a person trained in asking tough questions in the room.

It’s good business to have a philosopher on hand.

A meta-analysis of studies shows that there is a positive correlation between how a business approaches social and environmental issues, commonly under the banner of corporate social responsibility, and profit. The presence of a person who knows how to ask the right questions and worry about something other than profit is a vital part of being able to take advantage of that correlation.

In our modern age, where the rapid pace of technological advances can outpace our regulations, a resident philosopher can help a business address issues of privacy, artificial intelligence, data collection, and how those things relate to their values in lieu of official guidelines. Failures on these fronts are well known, and a little guidance on these issues might have helped.



So, will there soon be a slew of in-house philosophers at fortune 500 companies? Perhaps not right away, but the benefits of having a philosophic check-up every now and again are becoming more evident. The age of the philosopher CEO might be far off, but it doesn’t sound as absurd as it might have before."

The optronic devices will be co-developed by Thales and MKU and both the optronic devices and F90 rifles will be manufactured in India at MKU’s facilities in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. These products will be offered to the Indian army and homeland security forces under the ‘Make in India’ initiative of the Government.

On the occasion, Mr. Neeraj Gupta, MD of MKU said, “MKU is pleased to sign the strategic co-operation MoUs with Thales. This partnership will not only focus on meeting the requirements of our forces in India, but will also look at exporting the products to other parts of the world.”

Alex Cresswell, Senior Executive Vice-President for Land & Air Systems at Thales said, ""We are very pleased to work in close collaboration with MKU for the development of weapons and optronic devices to address specific needs of the Indian and international markets. This co-development partnership reaffirms our commitment to India and is the result of our ambition to support soldiers on operations.""

The strategic co-operation for optronic devices between Thales and MKU is committed to enhancing the night fighting capabilities of the Indian Army and homeland security forces. It envisages manufacturing of optronics equipment including weapon sights, night vision goggles, handheld thermal imagers and thermal infrared sensor engine for soldier systems, and other image intensification and thermal imaging systems for soldiers and platforms respectively.



For weapons, the two companies plan to cooperate so that MKU could set-up an assembly and manufacturing plant in India for the carbine version of the F90 assault rifle, combat-proven and already in service with Australian Defence Forces. Light, balanced and accurate, the F90CQB (Close Quarter Battle) developed with MKU will be well suited to Indian conditions and requirements.



The F90 assault rifle has bullpup design and open architecture allow it to be configured for a wide range of mission profiles. The rifle has an overall length of 700 mm and a weight of 3.25 kg. It is equipped with a 407 mm-long fixed and lighter barrel. The barrel lengths of 3.39 kg F90M and 3.15 kg F90CQB variants are 508 mm and 360 mm respectively. The F90 is a gas-operated, selective fire weapon with a bullpup layout. It is chambered for the standard NATO 5.56x45 mm ammunition."

Thales ramps up Aussie dev-ops - https://www.innovationaus.com/,"Thu, 12 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlubm92YXRpb25hdXMuY29tL3RoYWxlcy1yYW1wcy11cC1hdXNzaWUtZGV2LW9wcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales is hiring up developers for its Australian programming centre to help build an ambitious air traffic control system that will cover 11 per cent of the globe’s airspace as the group investigates the looming problem of how to manage swarms of delivery drones.

The French transport, aerospace, defence and aviation systems heavyweight inked a deal with the Federal government in February to build the $1.2 billion Onesky project, a combined civil and military ATC system that will supervise Australasian air space as far away as the middle of the Indian ocean.

The project is funded by Airservices Australia and Defence.

Local software development and support for Onesky will come from the Thales centre of excellence in Melbourne – one of only two in the world, the other being in Paris.

“It will grow, of course, because of the size of the (Onesky) project,” said Thales chief executive and chairman Patrice Caine. “The centre of excellence will expand and grow and beyond Onesky, [and] it will give the centre more momentum to address export markets.”

“It’s a joint ambition with the Commonwealth of Australia,” said Mr Patrice adding local jobs would also be created along the Onesky supply chain. Presently, Thales has more than 3000 employees in Australia.

Mr Patrice was speaking at a Thales cyber security media event in Paris where the company was spruiking its cyber chops. Thales has Euro 500 million in cyber revenue that’s expected to grow 10 per cent in 2018 and already employs 5000 cyber engineers worldwide.

Onesky will need cyber hardening of its own and Thales was demoing its ATC and airport security systems at the Paris media event.

Onesky has had its problems getting over the finish line and faced criticism from the Australian National Audit Office last year over value for money, as well as being put on the Defence Department’s Projects of Concern list, from which it has now been removed.

The deal was expected to close in 2015 for a 2021 completion date but will now not likely be fully operational until 2023 or beyond.

Mr Caine defended the drawn out deal signing process, saying it was better to hit the start line late but with “common understanding”.

“The project has taken a bit of time not because of difficulties but because of complexity. It’s the first time in the world that civil and defence air traffic will be managed by the same system – two different types of operators under the same system

“The level of complexity is very, very high. That’s why it has taken several years to make sure that when we start we start on an extremely precise and common understanding with the two customers and ourselves.

“I think it was a wise decision to take a bit more time before, to save time after.”

He said the first stage of the project would be completed “beyond 2020” but would give no further guidance on the project’s completion citing customer confidentiality.

Meanwhile, Thales is eyeing the age of the drones and the problems of managing swarms of autonomous aircraft that would swamp the processing power of human air traffic controllers.

Mr Caine said that while there was no market desire at the moment to eliminate human ATCs, the coming of mass drone operations such as those envisaged by Amazon and others presented a whole new ATC challenge.

There is one key challenge that will need machines making decisions on behalf of human beings, which is the insertion of UAVs just because of the number of flying objects that potentially, once they are authorised, would be flying at the same time in a given airspace.

“It is not humanly possible to manage thousands if not millions of objects flying at the same time,” said Mr Patrice, adding that drone ATC would rely on machines rather than humans.

“We have started to work on this key challenge,” he said. “We need to demonstrate that the AI becomes certifiable which is not the case at the moment.”

He said the level of certainty in an AI system managing swarms of UAVs needed to be on a whole other level to present day systems.

Mistakes common in say present day AI driven object recognition systems were unacceptable in physical environments where safety was paramount, he said.

“That’s why we need what I call explainable AI where if the machine gives a wrong answer we can explain why. The second step is developing certifiable AI where you can certify up to a level of probability,” he said.

Such systems could be needed within the next five years, Mr Patrice said and pointed to demand from China

“Why China? Because there is huge pressure coming from the likes of Alibaba. These big boys want to deliver parcels by drones. They want to demonstrate the benefits and show they are one step ahead of the competition.”

“As these players are very powerful there is high pressure on the civil aviation authority in China to find a solution,” said Mr Patrice adding that systems involving Thales already managed 60 percent of China’s airspace.

Thales is casting around for a site for an Asia located digital factory to support digital transformation efforts in the region.

Mr Caine did not disclose where it would be, although he did say Australia and India were potential candidates for the next digital factory. The decision on the site for the digital factory will later this year.

Thales F90 MBR assault rifle highlighted at DSA 2018

Developed by Thales Australia from the battle-proven F90 used by the Australian Defence Force, the MBR delivers the flexibility and interoperability by Asian modern armed forces.

The F90MBR is completely interoperable with NATO weapons. The F90MBR is one of the lightest assault rifles on the market at 3.25 kg, and is fitted with ambidextrous controls to enable fast reaction times and rapid target engagement. Features include availability in multiple barrel lengths, fully-ambidextrous forward bolt and magazine release controls, and a ‘drop free’ magazine release function to facilitate even faster magazine changes, regardless of the handdominance of the firer. The F90MBR safely accommodates offhanded shooting techniques through the use of a case deflector, and can be easily modified by the operator without tools to a dedicated left or right handed ejecting weapon.

The weapon’s open architecture incorporates a NATO tri-rail system and magazine compatibility to ensure interoperability with existing NATO weapons. It is able to be packaged with multiple barrels, and compatible optics, accessories and ancillaries with Grab Case, allowing an operator to quickly transition between different tactical employments of the weapon system. ‘Over The Beach’ capability means it is well suited for use by amphibious forces. Soldiers can swim with the weapon, and fire

Immediately after emerging from the water.

The F90, and now the F90MBR, set the benchmark for accuracy and reliability in small arms to support soldiers in operations. Building on over 100 years of extensive experience and expertise in small arms manufacture, the F90MBR is evolved from the battleproven F90 weapon, delivering ergonomic, modularity and interoperability enhancements, while retaining the same high levels of accuracy and reliability as the F90. Both the F90 and F90MBR enable the soldier to reach up to 600m accurately and with ease. Proven world class reliability ensures a war fighter can have absolute confidence in his weapon in the most demanding environmental conditions, whether that be the sands of the desert, the humidity of the jungle or in extreme cold.

Our partnership reflects the ‘new space’ transformation strategy being implemented by Thales Alenia Space, with the aim of becoming a major manufacturer of observation satellite constellations featuring short revisit times, both in Europe and the United States.”

On, Thales Alenia Space, Telespazio and Spaceflight Industries finalized their new alliance. They will be building 60 Earth observation satellites and delivering innovative geospatial services. Thales Alenia Space and the American company Spaceflight Industries created an equally-owned joint venture, LeoStella LLC.

Onten newsatellites were successfully launched by SpaceX from the Vandenberg launch base in California. A total of 50 satellites are now in orbit, more than two-thirds of this constellation. Built by Thales Alenia Space as prime contractor for Iridium, this constellation will provide global connectivity through its 66 interconnected satellites, operating at an altitude of 780 km. They form a global network providing unrivaled communication capacity for mobiles, whether people, vehicles, planes or ships, with a coverage zone including oceans and the poles.More than half of the satellites in the first constellation, built by Motorola, have now been replaced by these Iridium NEXT satellites, without in any way interrupting service for the million Iridium subscribers.

We caught up with Frances Holmes, finalist for Young Consultant of the Year at the Management Consultancies Association Awards, to discuss a whirlwind 12 months, what makes her tick and plans for the next five years.

Not a bad few months being awarded Thales Consultant of the Year in 2017 and now, your nomination for MCA award Young Consultant of the Year - how are you feeling?

A little overwhelmed to be honest. It’s great to be recognised for the work I have done, but I am still very early in my career and I know I have got a lot more I want to do and learn, I guess this is just the start.

What's a typical day look like for you?

The great thing about consultancy is no day is the same. At the moment I work across two clients, one internal to Thales in the innovation hub and one external in a government department. Both are different projects and utilise and develop a diverse range of skills. One day I am in London, embedded in a government team, managing a business change initiative, the next I am talking to engineers in Thales to progress there projects along business and customer axes.



What's the best part of your work…?

The variety of people I get to work with and meet on a daily basis. Thales employees are experts in their fields and always willing to talk me through the details of their projects. External stakeholders have come to talk to me at events because I am from Thales, meeting experts in smart cities, cryptography across industry and government departments. The network I am building is diverse and deep in knowledge and expertise.



…And the most challenging?

I am a natural introvert, so large meeting and networking events are always something I need to “Big Myself Up” for. It gets easier the more I do it, but I still get those butter flies before I enter a large event where I do not know anyone.



What are the Thales Cyber & Consulting team like to work with?

I have not yet had the opportunity to work with a lot of teams in TC&C as I have been out on contract since I started. However, whenever I have had questions, everyone always has time to help. The structure is really flat, and the management are very approachable. If you have a good idea and a forward approach, your thoughts and opinions will always be heard.



Now for a bit of background…

What did you study at University?

I studied Maths at Newcastle University. I did an undergraduate masters in mathematics, specialising in General Relativity and black holes for my thesis.



Any ways you can link the concepts you learnt at Uni with your work at Thales?

My degree and thesis gave me a great foundation in code development and ground breaking theories. This has driven my work in the research and innovation domains. It has allowed me to understand the technical aspects of the projects I am working on and be able to communicate effectively with the SME community. I fully appreciating the constrains and limitations they are under.



Have you had any challenges in your career? If so, how did you overcome it and what did it teach you?



I am definitely still coming face-to-face with challenges every day. I don’t feel like you ever stop learning, and you only learn when you are challenged with something new. I constantly have times when I feel I could have delivered my knowledge and argument better, or that I should have gone about a task differently, but that’s all the learning curve we go through to improve. I don’t expect to know it all at 28, I have a lot more to learn and many more times to will fail before I get it right.



Back to the future…

Where do you see your career in five years?

I have been asked this question a number of times over the past year, especially around appraisal times. It is never a question I really know how to answer. My career to date has definitely not been planned out, I wouldn’t expect to be here, as a business consultant 5 years ago when I finished my degree. So here goes for an answer, in 5 years’ time I want to be a senior leader in a technology organisation, building on my internal and external network at Thales. I want to have challenged and broken down barriers. I want to enjoy every day of my career and continue to be challenged.



Any favourite quotes?

I clearly say “Love” to much in conversation, when referring to someone. I think its my northern routes. But I think my fav quote I live by is not to be afraid to fail, if you always play it safe you won’t do anything of note.



What do you like to do in your down time?

I am a qualified sailing instructor and yacht day skipper, so I do love sailing. Unfortunately I don’t get to do it as much as I would like.



And finally… favourite food?

Bolognaise, that was easy, it’s my go to comfort food."

Senegal acquires Thales helicopter training systems - defenceWeb,"Wed, 25 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuY2V3ZWIuY28uemEvYWVyb3NwYWNlL2Flcm9zcGFjZS1hZXJvc3BhY2Uvc2VuZWdhbC1hY3F1aXJlcy10aGFsZXMtaGVsaWNvcHRlci10cmFpbmluZy1zeXN0ZW1zL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Senegal’s Armed Forces will use a helicopter mission trainer from Thales to train its Mi-35 attack helicopter and Mi-17 transport helicopter pilots.

Thales on 20 April said its helicopter mission trainer will enable pilots to acquire and develop tactical skills and be mission-ready.

“The Senegalese Armed Forces are involved in a wide range of deployments in remote theatres, conducting operations beyond the scope of traditional homeland defence. For this reason, they need to improve the tactical training of attack helicopter pilots,” Thales said.

The Thales helicopter mission trainer will allow pilots to train in a diverse array of programmable tactical scenarios, such as combat search and rescue, naval operations or even commando insertion/extraction. All training will be analysed at a debriefing station to prepare for a successful mission.

“Thanks to a high definition visual database and to a rich, synthetic and powerful environment, the flexible, modular trainer can be configured to allow individual pilot and commander training as well as training of entire aircrews for collective operations, such as multi-crew and multiplatform coordination and combined arms deployments,” Thales said.

“These training tools of the future have been developed using Thales state-of-the-art technologies to enable highly effective instruction and training. The Senegalese Armed Forces will benefit from a training system perfectly matching the tactical training requirements of helicopter pilots, reconstructing operational conditions with a high degree of realism,” said General Joseph M. Diop, Air Force Chief of Staff of the Senegalese Armed Forces.

The helicopter tactical trainer is part of Thales’s portfolio of simulation products. For over fifteen years, French Army Light Aviation (ALAT) helicopter pilots have been using the EDITH helicopter tactical trainer platform from Thales for collective instruction and training.

Senegal’s helicopter training system will be installed at the Air Force academy near Dakar.

Senegal last year received three refurbished Mi-24V attack helicopters from Poland’s WZL-1 aviation company after ordering the aircraft from Slovakia in 2015. The first Mi-24 to be overhauled by WZL-1 was delivered in February 2017. WZL-1 also provided technical training for Senegalese personnel on the helicopters.

In addition to the three refurbished Hinds, Senegal in 2007 received two Mi-24/35Ps in 2007 after placing an order from Russia in 2005. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Senegal also received two Mi-171s from Russia.

In June 2016 it was announced that Senegal was upgrading its Mi-24 attack helicopters with Israeli Controp DSP-HD electro-optical systems.

Apart from the helicopter training system, Senegal also ordered from Thales this month an unspecified number of Ground Master 400 air surveillance radars along with SkyView command and control systems."

Phil Tarrant: Oh, g'day everyone, it's Phil Tarrant here. Thanks for joining us on the Defence Connect Podcast today. It's always a pleasure having you along as we navigate all areas of defence and defence industry.

Today, we have someone in the studio. It's the first time and thankful that we've had someone from this organisation come in, Thales. For Defence Connect, we always watch with interest how Thales and its many, many different departments in arms is supporting defence initiatives. Also, into the civil sector, and I know moving forward, cyber is a very important place for Thales.

But a lot of people will be familiar with Thales from some of its Navy work, and also one of the original manufacturers in New South Wales at least, the Lithgow Arms Factory. And today I have someone from the Integrated Weapons and Sensors section coming in to have a chat with us about all things Thales in that domain, Graham Evenden. He's the Director of Integrated Weapons and Sensors, and he sits within Land and Air Systems Division of Thales and there's lots of divisions, so hopefully we can work out how it all fits together.

Graham, how you going? Thanks for joining us.

Graham Evenden: Yeah, thanks very much. Nice to be here.

Phil Tarrant: So, just a couple of remarks, as most people will be familiar with Thales' naval work, naval programmes, and also familiar with the work that you do up in Lithgow, and the Lithgow Arms Manufacturing Centre. It's been around for a considerable period of time delivering capabilities into the Australian Army. And it may have some big plans for how it might be able to position itself to capitalise on export potential moving forward as well, both within the, I guess, domestic or the civilian area and also the arms sort of things.

On the podcast today, Graham, I just really want to get a better understanding for your particular area within Thales, the scope of work that you're doing and just get your views and interpretation on the opportunities around Australian manufacturing into the future. I think if we cover all that off, we'll be doing pretty well.

So can you just give us a background on Lithgow? It's a very historic manufacturing facility for New South Wales and Australia. It's been around since the early 1900's, but for our listeners that aren't familiar with it, could you give us a quick background on what it's doing and the sort of stuff it's producing today?

Graham Evenden: Yeah, sure. You're right, it has been around since 1912, actually, and so just over the hundred year mark. It's been in 100% Thales ownership since 2006. A real note as well is that from about 2010, there's been some significant investment from Thales in the facility, both in terms of financial investment, clearly, but also investment in the people and also investment in the technology and the IP that's being created in the facility as well.

I think most people listening to this may be familiar with a contract that was awarded in 2015, which was for 30,000 assault rifles from Defence. And we're in the process of delivering those rifles right now.

What it has done, is it has allowed us to really invest in a whole number of areas as a masoned area. Most recently, we're also investing in the number of people working for us. We're up to about 180 people here now across the IWS business. My joy to those in Lithgow. And that actually represents a 35% increase in the number of people working in the business in the last four years. So you can see it's really starting to take shape.

Another key aspect is not just increasing the number of jobs, which is really important, particularly in that area of New South Wales; unemployment is quite high, and we're a very important - probably the largest employer in Lithgow, and a significant employer in the region.

Most importantly, though, we're also investing in the skills of our workforce for the future. We've always had an apprenticeship scheme within the factory, and they've typically trained your traditional mechanical-type trades, like fitter and turner and toolmaker, which are important and remain important. But this year, working with skillset with improving the apprenticeship scheme again. And now, they'll move up to a Certificate Four, and we'll start to look at other technical areas as part of the training scheme as well.

For example, they'll continue to do the mechanical stuff, but they'll also start to look at electronics, they'll start to look at mechatronics, and they'll start to look at maths and other aspects during their training period.

Phil Tarrant: So is it outside the manufacturing you do up in Lithgow...I know you produce the F90 there, the F90MBR, there's quite a lot of civilian stuff - sporting rifles coming out of Lithgow. How prepared is the manufacturing facility there for the next generation of workers, the next generation of contracts coming through? What sort of investment, what sort of infrastructure needs to go in there for Lithgow to remain a major manufacturer of Australian weaponry?

Graham Evenden: Yes, so Thales has been investing quite significantly, particularly since 2010. And if you get a chance to visit Lithgow, you're more than welcome any time.

Phil Tarrant: I should come up.

Graham Evenden: Yeah, absolutely. And you will see the difference in the plant and the machinery that is in there now. We're bringing on new machines every year, and those machines require new skills every year as well. So you can see the investment in that side.

What we're also doing, though, is investing in the future. So while we have a bunch of engineers working on today's part development, taking new products to the market, and you see in the F90MBR, which is absolutely the export variant of the F90, and also in the sporting market as well. We also have people working on the next generation of small arms. And by next generation, I mean five-plus years out. Those products will be absolutely next generation, and of course, they will require investment in manufacturing process, materials, and skills to make them a reality as well. And we've already started that process. The apprenticeship scheme is one of those. We're also bringing on graduate engineers into Lithgow for the first time ever. They're bringing with them skills that are gonna see us get ready for the future.

So we're in this for the long haul, absolutely. We definitely see a future and we definitely see a future in increased exports on the back of it as well.

Phil Tarrant: Can you give me some visibility about the process for innovation in rifles and small arms? You're talking about five years, ten years ahead.

Phil Tarrant: There's manufacturing work going underway right now in terms of the F90 and the export variant. But how does that innovation happen to look into how rifles, small arms, are going to look sort of into the future? You said it's something you focus on obviously, but how does that work?

Graham Evenden: It's a really good question, actually. This is where being a small-arms OEM that is part of a defence prime like Thales is really advantageous...

Phil Tarrant: Mm-hmm. (affirmative)

Graham Evenden: ...because we're allowed to look at what the soldier's requirements will be in the future holistically, and not just from a mechanical weapon perspective. I wouldn't like to say too much more about it...

Phil Tarrant: Mm-hmm. (affirmative)

Graham Evenden: ...but the message is that we're looking at systems, and being part of Thales certainly enables us to do just that.

Phil Tarrant: And the origination process behind the development of new tech, new weaponry, is it customer-led? So is the Army saying to you, ""These are the applications that we require in the modern battlefield moving forward, and therefore, can you develop this?"" Or is it the other way, where you identify academic talent or manufacturing talent and bring them into Thales and provide a solution into Army or other services?

Graham Evenden: It's a mixture of both.

Phil Tarrant: Okay.

Graham Evenden: At the very beginning, we were calling it the value proposition canvas, we would call it.

Phil Tarrant: Hmm.

Graham Evenden: We're trying to identify the current customer user, more importantly, the current soldiers' pains, and what gains they're looking for. And clearly we would ignore the wishes of the customer at our peril there, 'cause it is absolutely critical to have that dialogue with the user in particular. But we've also got to blend that with our knowledge of current and emerging technology as well. So sometimes we need to look beyond that horizon that has typically been created by the user. So we've got to mix those two lines.

For example, within Lithgow, we've newly created an innovation team. And that's a very diverse group of people, and that diversity comes from not just their age and sex and so on, but also their diversity in experiences. And we kind of show them into a room together and try to remove as many of the rules and regulations that there would normally be expecting, and really let them come up with the ideas for the future.

Phil Tarrant: Hmm.

Graham Evenden: We've formalised that now within Lithgow itself, and we're starting to see some of the results from that process. And those results are being fed back into the R & D programme, if you like.

So, a mixture of the customer is absolutely king, but we need to keep an eye on emerging technologies and, in fact, create some of them, technologies for the future.

Phil Tarrant: Hmm. And I'm quite fortunate in my job that I get to see a fair bit of manufacturing; some of the very, very sophisticated with the most mechanised processes all the way through to some pretty old-school welding of steel. And it pretty much paints the picture of the defence industry. And I haven't visited Lithgow, and I will do, but if I'd arrived on the floor, or speak to your people. How would you articulate the culture of manufacturing within Thales and at Lithgow? If you tried to paint that picture somehow?

Graham Evenden: Yes. That's a good question.

Phil Tarrant: There's a bit of a tough one, because everyone sees it a bit different. Yeah.

Graham Evenden: That's a tough one, but interestingly, we actually went through this exercise ourselves...

Phil Tarrant: Okay.

Graham Evenden: ...over eighteen months ago, and we were working on our Vision Statement and our Mission, and tried to come up with something that meant something to everyone in the factory.

Phil Tarrant: Yeah.

Graham Evenden: And delivering precision is the mantra, the feeling of that if you like...

Phil Tarrant: Okay.

Graham Evenden: And it's interesting, of course, 'cause precision can mean many things, and it's Precision In Manufacturing, and every single person in that factory who the vast majority have some link to either a previous generation that has worked there...

Phil Tarrant: Hmm.

Graham Evenden: ...and, therefore, some link to World War I, World War II, and absolutely take their job seriously. They know that whatever they manufacture is going to be carried by a soldier - an Australian soldier - whose life is gonna be in danger. And they want to make sure that thing is gonna work.

So Precision In Manufacturing. But also, of course, the spinoff is precision in the firing of the weapon as well, as an accurate system that we built.

Culture, even in my time, and I've been with the business eight years now, is changing, moving towards that high-performance culture.

Phil Tarrant: Hmm.

Graham Evenden: And momentum is going now, and the workforce is heading in that direction by themselves. And they're ready now for new technologies to come online, and already we've introduced some of those technologies into the manufacturing area as well as the design area.

Phil Tarrant: Hmm. It's interesting because you talk about this pedigree, or legacy, of Lithgow from 1912, so it's seen a number of World Wars, and Australian soldiers, and people in the military have been deployed many, many times over many decades in a lot of the different conflicts. But you draw this parallel between the people who are on the floor manufacturing these arms actually identify with the end-usage of it. That's a big part of the core, is it, do they...

Graham Evenden: Absolutely. That's central to the culture there...

Phil Tarrant: Mm-hmm. (affirmative)

Graham Evenden: ...and it's something that we dearly hang on to and want to maintain and foster...

Phil Tarrant: Hmm.

Graham Evenden: ...actually. So when the daily meetings are going on around the factory, if everyone's involved, and knows it at various levels, then the user is always front-and-center on the discussion. So if there's an issue, ultimately, we need to understand: will the issue have an impact on the user, and if the answer is yes, then that's clearly unacceptable, and then it's fixing and then we move on with life.

Phil Tarrant: Hmm.

Graham Evenden: We also are fortunate that we do have a number of visits from Army. Clearly, we have some VIP visitors from the Acquisition area. But we're also lucky we get users to visit, we also get maintainers to visit in uniform, and that's absolutely important for us. We want to maintain that link.

Phil Tarrant: Hmm. And what's your view of Australian manufacturing? Depending what media route or who you listen to, they're gonna paint a picture of Australian manufacturing capabilities in the doldrums, closure of car plants, manufacturing is now done offshore? I know I've had some good conversations with people who see the world very differently, and paint a picture of manufacturing, which isn't the actual mechanical doing of building something, it's the whole process from design, conceptualization all the way through to the export market. But Thales and, I guess, the pedigree of 100-plus years manufacturing for the Army...are you confident about Australia's ability to manufacture into the future, or do you think competitive forces will potentially take all this stuff offshore?

Graham Evenden: No, I'm very optimistic and confident in the future of manufacturing in Australia, certainly through my optic, from within the IWS business. Brother in that as well. I think what's important is...Lithgow was previously a build-to-print organisation, a government-owned build-to-print organisation, and therefore, they're reliant purely on defence contracts to maintain a workforce...

Phil Tarrant: Hmm.

Graham Evenden: ...maintain that capability. That's no longer the case, and since Thales' ownership, we have now vertically integrated into a true small-arms OEM. So now we design our own products. We qualify our own products. We manufacture those products. We sustain those products.

We also, as a consequence, understand what manufacturing processes have got to come in to maintain competitiveness into the future. And it isn't about necessarily reducing the cost to manufacture something, it's more about creating value in the product, such that it can stand on its own two feet around the world. It doesn't have to be the cheapest product to do that, it has to be the best value product to do that.

Phil Tarrant: Hmm.

Graham Evenden: And I think the future, a successful future in manufacturing for Lithgow in particular, but Thales and other companies as well, is to ensure that they invest in IP and innovation, to create products and services that add on value to the user.

Phil Tarrant: Hmm. And what's your feel of the new generation of potential Lithgow team members, manufacturing in general...it's hard to attract good apprentices these days. It feels like every single kid that finishes school wants to go to university, and enter that particular workforce, whereas opportunities across trades has never been better in Australia. But the challenge is attracting people in these jobs. What's Thales doing to make sure you get the absolute best apprentices in the market to continue what's required for the end user, and as you painted the picture, it's a pretty important customer whose getting your kit?

Graham Evenden: Absolutely. We're very fortunate when recruiting apprentices in Lithgow. It's perhaps easier than other parts of the country. The demand for apprenticeships is greater than the supply of apprenticeships, it's as simple as...

Phil Tarrant: That's really...

Graham Evenden: ...as simple as that...

Phil Tarrant: ...that's great.

Graham Evenden: ...absolutely, we...

Phil Tarrant: Yeah.

Graham Evenden: ...so we currently have, I think it's 10 apprentices on at the moment, with a plan to grow that up to 20 over the next four years. For every apprentice vacancy we have, we have scores of applicants for that job.

Phil Tarrant: Local kids, or all over the place?

Graham Evenden: Absolutely, local. Lithgow and the neighbouring towns, so you know, Bathurst, back down towards the Blue Mountains. But mostly from Lithgow.

Phil Tarrant: Hmm.

Graham Evenden: And, God, we've got some really, really good young talent in our apprentices at the moment, and have had for a number of years. That's how we're able to bring these apprentices on, and not just expose them to that traditional apprenticeship scheme, which is good. But they've got the skills, and they've got the drive, and they've got the energy, and they've got the determination to go that extra step that we've asked them to do now, for the Mechatronics software, et cetera, et cetera.

So we're very fortunate. And even now, bringing on graduates into Lithgow as well, for the first time ever, we've done that this year.

Phil Tarrant: Hmm.

Graham Evenden: A mechanical engineer and a Mechatronics engineer have joined the team just a few weeks ago. And they're from the top 3% in the country, and we've attracted them to the business. And the reason we've attracted them is because they see the future. And they also see the change that we're making in the business to be ready for the future.

Phil Tarrant: I guess what you're talking about there is automation in manufacturing, so how do you balance utilising some of the great tech coming in right now to support manufacturing capabilities blended with the skills and sophistication of the human, who's integral still to the manufacturing process? How do you go through that balance?

Graham Evenden: It's a good question. Lithgow is well-known within Thales globally. We were a very early adopter of LEAN manufacturing.

Phil Tarrant: Hmm.

Graham Evenden: And it's relatively mature now, and we're reaping the benefits from that. The next overlay, which is gonna really make a difference as well, is the automation aspects, as you say. We're really taking our first step on that journey, literally this year.

Phil Tarrant: Hmm.

Graham Evenden: So we're trying to understand where best to invest in automation to get the quickest return. We're doing that for the today and for the medium term, but we're also looking at the next generation of manufacturing as well, whether that be additive LEAN manufacturing, whether it be better use of polymers and coatings, and you know, all of these things are in the mix. So yeah, it seems to be working so far, so...

Phil Tarrant: Hmm.

Graham Evenden: ...fingers crossed.

Phil Tarrant: Yeah, I know it's something at the top of mind with most defence primes, or at least all defence primes who work within the manufacturing space, and that picture you painted before, you have the manufacturing you do is very different than the sort of manufacturing that's gonna happen down in Osborne building submarines and ships, but it comes down to the talent of the Australian workforce and our ability...a collective...agenda, I guess to make sure we're preparing all these major defence programmes coming online, and whether it's new stuff like frigates and subs, or it's long-term stuff like the provision of arms, how do we make sure that we are creating a defence industry which can attract the best talent, and make sure we get the best people into it? Because it is a national endeavour. And I know Thales is doing some great work that regards, as well as some other primes. Can you run us through any of those, particular programmes?

Graham Evenden: For me, one of the key reasons we can attract good talent into Thales, and Lithgow in particular, is because we attract them by giving them a vision of the future. Yup, so they'll come out of university, they'll have an insight as to what the next generation's meant to be looking like, and arrive at a factory that is still using C & C machines and cutting and grinding and that type of activity. Which is important, right? And we're good at that. But they help us on the journey to the next generation. You know, so they have a real value-added role to play in us transforming the business for the future.

Phil Tarrant: Hmm. It's interesting. And we've spoken a lot about the work you're doing up in Lithgow, but I know your area, integrated weapons and sensors is a lot more than that. We've touched briefly on the incubation of new ideas and how you can support your customers by creating new ways to do things. What other work sort of falls within your domain?

Graham Evenden: Within Lithgow, we also conduct maintenance, repair, and overhaul services for defence on third-party integrated weapons systems as well. So that's a relatively long-term contract. We also conduct, again, services: maintenance, repair services, on Thales and third-party optronic devices, so image intensifiers, thermalizers, and other laser devices. And they can be weapon-borne or vehicle-borne optronics. We actually own extensive optronics laboratories and workshops in our [inaudible 00:21:24] facility. We can actually manufacture high-tech products there already. We have an engineering team and a service team permanently based in there. And the third part of the business is we provide technical services to defence where it could be designing a solution for a specific problem...

Phil Tarrant: Hmm.

Graham Evenden: ...or helping them source a solution to a problem by going to market for them, and running competition, and making recommendations on the best solution in their weapons space.

Phil Tarrant: And, again, a collective opportunity for Australia is to shift us from being primarily a defence importer to creating our own products. And what you've explained is essentially sovereign capability around the manufacture of small arms, which is great. What role do you see Lithgow and your department within Thales playing on the export side? Is there big export opportunities for...I know you have the F90 MBR, which is the export variant. How you going about getting outside of Australia into other customers?

Graham Evenden: So there's a number of programmes that are live at the moment for export opportunities for the F90 and the F90MBR. As you say, that was a new product to market last year that was designed specifically for the export market. I wouldn't want to say what those programmes are, but I'll say that a number of them are live and at various stages of maturation at the moment.

As part of our growth, we also realise that we need to diversify and reduce reliance on defence contracts because they can be very cyclical. And we want to try and avoid that as much as possible. So we made that decision in 2014 to move to the sporting market as well, and our core competencies are pretty much the same. We took our first product to market in late 2014, early 2015, and now we're exporting to ten different countries around the world...

Phil Tarrant: Okay.

Graham Evenden: ...as of last year. And there are more countries coming online as well. And we do that under the brand of Lithgow Arms, and if there's any Australian shooters listening to this, then I'm sure they'll be very familiar with that brand and the products that are in there.

Phil Tarrant: That's good. And I'm quite intrigued how...'cause I do detect a twang to your accent, which...so Australia is not your home; I'd say Scotland, obviously. But what's the back story? How did you end up doing what you do here with Thales?

Graham Evenden: Yeah.

Phil Tarrant: You're an engineer by trade?

Graham Evenden: I'm not. I'm a soldier by profession.

Phil Tarrant: Okay.

Graham Evenden: So I was in the British Army for over 25 years.

Phil Tarrant: Okay.

Graham Evenden: And I ended up working in the British defence industry, the European defence industry, shall we say.

Phil Tarrant: Hmm.

Graham Evenden: And I was working in the small-arms, one of the major European small-arms companies when I first left the Army. And after that, I was consulting for various governments on soldier modernization activities, the British government, Norwegian government, and a couple of others. I found myself consulting for Thales in Australia in 2009, and they offered me a job. My wife said, ""That's a good idea, let's give that a go.""

Phil Tarrant: How you finding, is it okay?

Graham Evenden: Oh, we love it. Fantastic...

Phil Tarrant: It's a great place, is it?

Graham Evenden: Yeah we're here for...

Phil Tarrant: It's a cracking day today, it is, it's like...

Graham Evenden: Today...every time I drive over the Harbour Bridge, we still love to pinch ourselves, say...how did this happen?

Phil Tarrant: And this whole process of soldier modernization, it's perpetual. You never stop doing it. You'll always be thinking about the next thing. Talking about who the end customer is of, we're talking about the F90 now, the fact that guys and girls are relying on this kit in the field, so I guess your pedigree as a soldier yourself, you speak from experience in that regard. You know what it's like to have the right gear.

Graham Evenden: Absolutely. It's critical. There is no second-best. It's just got to be absolutely reliable all of the time. And no matter what the conditions are. Like the soldiers, their weapons will be exposed to extremes of climate and other difficult, challenging scenarios. And it has got to be up to the job. It's as simple as that. And we do it. And the F90 - and I would say this now, but the F90 is absolutely one of the most reliable firearms in the world.

Phil Tarrant: Yeah.

Graham Evenden: And the most accurate at the same time.

Phil Tarrant: Well, I know a lot of soldiers that would echo your sentiments there. And I guess on that basis, how do you go about...what's the process for obtaining field feedback so you can continually improve, or tweak, or you know, solve any potential problems, or better effect them? Is that part organic, or does that require a procedural base process?

Graham Evenden: As reasonably I talk, to be honest with you. Cast G is often a conduit to that, and we get good feedback on occasions. I was really pleased to see that, and this was in the media of course, that the F90 or EF80A as it would be known within defence, had completed its first operational tour with one of the battalions, and with glowing results as well. Fantastic. Often, the best feedback you get from a soldier on weapons, or their boots, or their gloves, is no feedback...

Phil Tarrant: No feedback at all. I'm sure soldiers are happy to say if they don't think something's working very well.

Graham Evenden: Absolutely.

Phil Tarrant: Yeah, so...no news is often good news.

Graham Evenden: Absolutely.

Phil Tarrant: Well, that's great. Graham, I've enjoyed chatting to you. We could probably expand the chat out. We've run out of time around the modernization within the Army and soldiers in general. It sounds like you've done quite a lot of consulting on that basis, so it's something which needs to be maintained constantly.

But I think the real opportunity here, that dovetails in with a lot of the conversations we have been having on defence Connect recently around export potential, and I know the government is firmly behind it. I know the Export Sales Catalog's just come out last week or the week before.

Graham Evenden: Yeah.

Phil Tarrant: Which Thales is part of. So it's good to see that, as well as the primes themselves doing the activities and the energy to try and export, that government's behind them as well to try and promote abroad as well, and make sure that Australian companies and Australian capabilities is connecting with people who might be potential customers for this gear. It's great that Thales has this story of the arms factory from 1912 to today, and I'm sure that's gonna be a story that continues. And I'll make sure I get out there and check it out, and have a look.

Graham Evenden: You're very welcome there, as I say. You'll meet a workforce that's very proud of what they do, and...

Phil Tarrant: Hmm.

Graham Evenden: 92% of our products are made in Australia. We have to offshore a couple of components only, but it's very much an Australian product, and we're proud to export it out of Australia.

Phil Tarrant: That's great. Now Graham, appreciate your time and thanks for coming in.

Graham Evenden: Thank you.

Deadline day for operator of Metro LRT Line - CTV News Edmonton,"Mon, 30 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vZWRtb250b24uY3R2bmV3cy5jYS9tb2JpbGUvZGVhZGxpbmUtZGF5LWZvci1vcGVyYXRvci1vZi1tZXRyby1scnQtbGluZS0xLjM5MDgyNzM_Y2FjaGU9a3hlYmRmc3l3Z3c_YXV0b1BsYXk9dHJ1ZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Monday marks a deadline for the contractor and operator of the problem-plagued Metro LRT Line, to sort out issues related to the line into northwest Edmonton.

In December, City Council gave Thales Canada until April 30, 2018 to get the system working properly – or face “serious consequences.”

The line opened to riders in September, 2015. It was nearly two years behind schedule.

Since then, signalling issues have plagued the line, resulting in slow-speed trains, and system errors.

A report released in 2017 found 50 cases where something went wrong with the line, usually issues with the brakes and sensors, and a handful of those cases were categorized in the report as “risks to the public.”

So far, Thales has not received full payment for work on the line.

CTV News has reached out to Thales for comment, the company has not responded.

French company will supply equipment for new control tower at the Dushanbe airport | Tajikistan News ASIA-Plus - asiaplustj.info,"Tue, 24 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hc2lhcGx1c3RqLmluZm8vZW4vbmV3cy90YWppa2lzdGFuL2Vjb25vbWljLzIwMTgwNDI0L2ZyZW5jaC1jb21wYW55LXdpbGwtc3VwcGx5LWVxdWlwbWVudC1mb3ItbmV3LWNvbnRyb2wtdG93ZXItYXQtdGhlLWR1c2hhbmJlLWFpcnBvcnTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Equipment for the new control tower at the Dushanbe airport will be supplied by French Company Thales, a source in the Tajik government told Asia-Plus today morning.

According to him, this issue has been discussed here at a meeting of Tajik Deputy Prime Minister, Azim Ibrohim, with Mr. Oliver Auchan (phonetically spelled), Vice-President of Thales.

The equipment is expected to be supplied to Tajikistan in the first half of 2019, the source added.

Recall, a cornerstone laying ceremony for a new control tower took place at Dushanbe International Airport (DIA) on March 14, 2018.

The Governent of France is sponsoring the construction of this significant strategic facility and French company Enterprise Marc Meunier will build the control tower at the Dushanbe airport. The project is reportedly expected to be completed in 2021.

A government-to-government agreement between Tajikistan and France on construction of the control tower at the Dushanbe airport was signed in Dushanbe on July 13, 2015.

The document was inked by the then Minister of Transport of Tajikistan Sherali Ganjalzoda and the then Ambassador of France to Tajikistan Didier Leroy.

An agreement on construction of a 41-meter control tower at the Dushanbe airport was reportedly reached in Dushanbe in February 2013.

Thales Group is a French multinational company that designs and builds electrical systems and provides services for the aerospace, defense, transportation and security markets. Its headquarters are in La Défense (the business district of Paris), and its stock is listed on the Euronext Paris.

The company changed its name to Thales from Thomson-CSF in December 2000 shortly after the £1.3 billion acquisition of Racal Electronics plc, a UK defense electronics group. It is partially state-owned by the French government, and has operations in more than 56 countries. It reportedly has 64,000 employees and generated €14.9 billion in revenues in 2016. It is also the 10th largest defense contractor in the world and 55% of its total sales are military sales."
MKU & Thales Team Up for Indian CQB Rifle - - The Firearm Blog,"Thu, 19 Apr 2018 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZpcmVhcm1ibG9nLmNvbS9ibG9nLzIwMTgvMDQvMTkvbWt1LXRoYWxlcy10ZWFtLXVwLWZvci1pbmRpYW4tY3FiLXJpZmxlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MKU Ltd. and Thales have announced that they will work together to enter India’s Close Quarter Battle Rifle trials. The announcement came on the 10th April, at Defexpo 2018, as the two companies signed two memorandums of understanding (MoU) for strategic co-operation.

The agreement covers the development of a carbine version of the F90, known as the F90CQB, and optronic devices to be mounted on the rifle for entry into India’s Rifle Program. The F90 is the export version of Australia’s EF88, developed by the Thales-owned Lithgow Small Arms Factory. The Kanpur-based MKU Ltd. specialises in producing defence equipment including helmets, ballistic vests, night vision optics and binoculars. The co-operation aims to enhance the future night fighting capabilities of the Indian Army.

The products from the initiative will be offered with the understanding that if adopted they will be produced under the Indian government’s ‘Made in India’ initiative.

MKU’s managing Director, Neeraj Gupta, said in a press release that his company is “pleased to sign the strategic co-operation MoUs with Thales. This partnership will not only focus on meeting the requirements of our forces in India, but will also look at exporting the products to other parts of the world.”

Alex Cresswell, Senior Executive Vice-President for Land and Air Systems at Thales said:

We are very pleased to work in close collaboration with MKU for the development of weapons and optronic devices to address specific needs of the Indian and international markets. This co-development partnership reaffirms our commitment to India and is the result of our ambition to support soldiers on operations.

If the submission from the two companies is successful, Thales will co-operate with MKU to enable the Indian company to set up a manufacturing plant in India to produce the F90CQB.
