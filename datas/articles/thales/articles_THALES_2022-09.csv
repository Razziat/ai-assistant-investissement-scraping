In 2022, Thales is stepping up its recruitment policy, with plans to hire 11,000 new people worldwide. In this joint interview to coincide with Euronaval 2022, talent development managers Audrey Attenti and Myriam Chevreuil discuss the opportunities available within the Group, which sees skills and career development as a long-term endeavour.

What would you say to a new graduate interested in joining Thales?

© UK Crown

Myriam Chevreuil (MC): I’d say that a career with us is a chance to take part in ambitious, far-reaching projects. For instance, Thales is currently developing solutions for greener aviation and designing the next generation of satellites. Or, to take an example from the naval sector, our Maritime Mine Countermeasures Programme (MMCM), which aims to boost performance in mine-clearance operations and improve personnel safety. It’s exciting and rewarding work: you’ll be involved in developing cutting-edge systems and disruptive new technologies for our customers, such as our Folding Light Acoustic System for Helicopters (FLASH) and the SonoFlash air-droppable sonobuoy, which can detect and locate increasingly evasive submarines. With these two recent success stories, Thales has cemented a position as a key player in naval defence and maritime security.

Audrey Attenti (AA): I’d say that working for Thales means choosing a career that makes a difference to people’s daily lives. In their own way, every one of our 81,000 employees is helping to make the world a better and safer place, to defend national sovereignty, to find new ways to respond to climate change, and much more besides.

What opportunities are currently available at Thales?

AA: Right now, we’re mainly seeking software and systems engineers and architects, cybersecurity engineers and project managers. With so many roles on offer, we naturally recruit people from all walks of life. In fact, if you look at the 9,000 new employees we hired globally in 2021, you’ll be hard-pressed to find two people with identical backgrounds. And because diversity is one of our core values, we don’t see a person’s education and qualifications as a barrier to advancement. At Thales, nobody’s trajectory is set in stone. We empower our employees to take control of their careers – to build their skills and abilities so they can progress upwards or sideways within the Group.

MC: We have long-standing partnerships with engineering schools, business schools, universities, institutes of technology and even high schools. In the naval sector, for instance, we have close ties with the French naval academy and ENSTA Bretagne. Our workforce is incredibly diverse in terms of roles and backgrounds, so we’re not only looking to hire engineers! We also need people to join our production and repair teams. Many of our employees come to us with undergraduate degrees or vocational qualifications in digital systme or industrial IT, for example. Internships and apprenticeships are also a key component of our recruitment policy: in 2021 alone, we took on 2,500 people on these types of contracts in France.

What is the Group’s internal mobility policy?

MC: At Thales, don’t keep our employees in a box. If you’re an engineer or technician and you join us in a naval-focused role, there’s nothing stopping you from moving into aerospace or cybersecurity down the line. Our people have transferable skills and we actively encourage them to keep trying their hand at something new. The Brest site, for instance, is home to both our naval and aerospace teams, so it’s relatively easy for employees to switch between the two. Thales’s common core of technologies – electronics, software and systems – significantly enhances mobility opportunities. Right now, we have 3,000 positions open to internal candidates.

AA: We also recognise the importance of retaining talented, motivated employees. When it comes to building long, fulfilling careers with Thales, determination and ambition matter just as much as technical expertise. To cite an example close to home, one of my colleagues in the talent acquisition team has an HR background but has always harboured a passion for aerospace. Recently, we gave him an opportunity to move into this line of work as a project manager. It wasn’t something he’d done before, but he worked with his manager to get the training he needed before making the switch.

Does Thales offer international mobility opportunities?

AA: Yes, of course. Thales has 46 sites in France, spread across seven different regions (Nouvelle Aquitaine, Ile-de-France, Centre Val-de-Loire, Grand Ouest, Provence-Alpes-Côte-d’Azur, Rhône-Alpes and Occitanie). But it also operates in 67 other countries. We hire people to fill vacancies in all these locations, as well as offering international mobility opportunities to current employees across all roles and functions. For example, one of our technical bid managers recently spent 18 months in Brazil, working on digital security projects at our Thales Digital Identity and Security sites in São Paulo and São Bernardo do Campo.

Do employees receive ongoing education and training?

MC: Yes. Our e-learning portal includes modules on all our areas of expertise, and we also run skills development programmes. Training is also a great way to familiarise employees with the changes affecting our business, such as the rise of drones and the second quantum revolution in the naval sector.

© F. Dekker - Brandbuilde©THALES

AA: Since our people operate in an environment that’s in constant flux, we follow the “70:20:10” model for learning and development.

This means that employees gain 70% of their new knowledge and skills through practice and experience, i.e. they “learn by doing”. Another 20% comes from interacting with their colleagues, manager, experts and members of their professional network. The final 10% is acquired through formal learning – by attending in-person or online courses, gaining certifications or completing accredited training. This model puts our people in charge of their own development and fosters a culture of knowledge-sharing across the organisation. Because the projects we work on are so complex, our employees need on-the-job training and constant support from their managers and colleagues. Speaking personally, there were holes in my knowledge when it came to systems engineering. To address those gaps, I spent hours visiting sites and talking and listening to colleagues. Every department is accustomed to onboarding new hires and welcoming employees who are changing roles.

Do all employees spend time immersed in front-line operations?

MC: Employees working on naval technologies go out into the field more often than most. Our engineers and technicians routinely spend several days at sea testing the products they’ve developed, such as new sonar suites or mine countermeasures systems. These immersive experiences are a great way for them to get to know our customers and learn more about their needs and priorities.

Do you have any final words?

AA: Whether you’re considering joining Thales’s naval division or any other area of our business, you can look forward to an exciting career, unlimited progression and development opportunities, and a chance to see the impact of your work first-hand. And you’ll be working with great colleagues in a stimulating and rewarding environment. So feel free to join us!"
KT SAT orders Koreasat 6A communications satellite from Thales - SpaceNews,"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9rdC1zYXQtb3JkZXJzLWtvcmVhc2F0LTZhLWNvbW11bmljYXRpb25zLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS1mcm9tLXRoYWxlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Thales Alenia Space said Sept. 12 it has signed a contract to deliver a communications satellite for South Korea’s KT SAT in the fourth quarter of 2024.

The Koreasat 6A spacecraft will have 20 transponders for fixed satellite services and six for TV broadcasting to replace Koreasat 6, which launched to geostationary orbit (GEO) at 116 degrees East in December 2010.

Thales Alenia Space of France and Italy built Koreasat 6 and has a long history of providing satellites for South Korea.

In addition to delivering three other communications satellites — Koreasat 5, 5A, and 7 — Thales Alenia Space has helped provide Earth observation, navigation, and meteorological spacecraft for the country.

The company is also supporting South Korea’s lunar exploration program, which is on track to send a robotic spacecraft to lunar orbit in December.

KT SAT CEO David Kyungmin Song said it picked Thales Alenia Space as prime contractor for Koreasat 6A after running a competitive process with multiple bidders.

Koreasat 6A will be based on the manufacturer’s Spacebus 4000B2 platform and is expected to weigh about 3.5 metric tons at launch. The manufacturer said it will be designed to operate for at least 15 years.

Thales Alenia Space is also training and supporting KT Sat’s on-site engineering team as part of its contract, and will provide operational assistance throughout the satellite’s operational lifetime.

While Koreasat 6A’s services will be focused on South Korea, KT SAT has coverage over other countries in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa with its fleet of four fully owned satellites built by Thales Alenia Space, and capacity the operator leases from a satellite manufactured by what is now Maxar Technologies.

Thales Alenia Space said it had signed a launch contract for Koreasat 6A that it expects to announce shortly.

GEO rebound

Speaking to SpaceNews on the sidelines of World Satellite Business Week here, Thales Alenia Space CEO Hervé Derrey said the company has secured orders for eight GEO satcoms satellites in the last 10 months.

Most of these are based on Thales Alenia Space’s Space Inspire platform, part of a new breed of software-defined satellites that can be reprogrammed in orbit to respond to changing data demands.

However, Koreasat 6A, ASTRA 1P for SES, and HTS 113BT for Indonesia’s Telkomsat are classic GEO satellites without a software-defined payload, which Derrey said promises better economics for operators with more stable demand forecasts that are also looking to deploy their spacecraft faster.

Despite Koreasat 6A’s speedy two-year delivery schedule, Derrey is confident Thales Alenia Space can avoid getting caught up in supply chain issues that have slowed down other satellite projects across the industry.

“It’s a product that is fully developed — for which we also have some stock in terms of components,” he said.

Still, Derrey expects software-defined satellites will cover “at least 60% of the GEO market” in the coming years.

These flexible satellites are helping to drive a “rebound in the GEO [satcoms] market,” he added, which appears on track to average “between 12 and 15” orders a year.

Although that is still short of the 20 GEO orders the industry was pulling in annually seven years ago, it is a significant improvement on the fewer than 10 orders a year the market has seen recently.

Derrey attributed part of the GEO slump to uncertainty in the market from incoming constellations in non-geostationary orbit (NGSO).

“There was a kind of belief at that time that [NGSO] would totally replace GEO,” he said.

However, operators increasingly see GEO and NGSO capabilities as complementary, Derrey added, pointing to the synergies Eutelsat and OneWeb aim to achieve by combining their networks.

"Thales Alenia Space To Lead EROSS IOD, On-Orbit Servicing Project - Space Ref","Tue, 20 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VyZWYuY29tL3NwYWNlLWNvbW1lcmNlL3RoYWxlcy1hbGVuaWEtc3BhY2UtdG8tbGVhZC1lcm9zcy1pb2Qtb24tb3JiaXQtc2VydmljaW5nLXByb2plY3Qv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"EROSS IOD, On-Orbit Servicing Project Thales Alenia Space

Thales Alenia Space, the joint venture between Thales (67 %) and Leonardo (33 %), and its Partners have been chosen by the European Commission to lead EROSS IOD, a programme dedicated to On-Orbit Servicing.

EROSS IOD (European Robotic Orbital Support Services In Orbit Demonstrator) will validate the technologies needed for robotic in-space servicing operations, culminating in an European pioneering mission by 2026. This mission will demonstrate satellite rendezvous, capture, docking, refuelling and payload exchange capabilities to drive major advances in space robotics for future on-orbit robotic missions.

With the growing number of satellites circling the Earth and the easier access to space to answer the needs of global population, from geolocation to connectivity, through weather forecasts and environment monitoring, Thales Alenia Space is devising smart On-Orbit Servicing missions to directly manage satellites while they are operating in space. The goal is to extend satellite lifetimes while also limiting space debris to enable better management of the current and future space assets. On-Orbit Servicing vehicles represent a real paradigm shift, since future space systems will be able to undergo maintenance and upgrades even in orbit. By introducing unrivalled system scalability and flexibility, they will be a real game changer. Satellites as we know can therefore be designed in a completely new way.

Thales Alenia Space is an European leader in On-Orbit Servicing, a new approach to space exploration based on smarter and more innovative missions that contribute to a more sustainable space as reflected in Thales Alenia Space’s “Space for Life” vision.

This EROSS IOD program is under Grant Agreement Preparation and expected to start in January 2023.

Thales Alenia Space, a pioneer in On-Orbit Servicing: Over the last six years, Thales Alenia Space has led extensive R&D activities for the Strategic Research Cluster (SRC) on Space Robotics Technologies, part of the European Commission’s vast Horizon 2020 research programme.

The first phase kicked off in 2016 with Integrated 3D Sensors (I3DS), a project designed to develop a suite of sensors for robotic missions involving a rendezvous in space with another vehicle or object. The second phase was EROSS in 2019, which used ground tests to validate the technologies required for On-Orbit Servicing operations. Thales Alenia Space won Etoiles de l’Europe awards from the French Ministry of Higher Education, Research & Innovation for both these projects. For the third and last phase, which started in 2021, the EROSS+ project is gearing up for an in-orbit demonstration, through the preliminary design stage and maturation of the key building blocks. The recently selected EROSS IOD project builds on this experience to develop a one of a kind European mission.

SpeQtral and Thales Alenia Space, a joint Venture between Thales (67 %) and Leonardo (33 %), has announced that it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (“MoU”) to research, develop and demonstrate quantum communications from space to Earth.

From space to Earth: SpeQtral-1 satellite to transmit qubits to Thales Alenia Space’s ground station in precursor demonstrations for quantum information networks.

The collaboration, which will likely involve a consortium of other relevant French technology partners as well, provides an excellent platform for both countries to collaborate and conduct joint experiments, leveraging on the respective counterparts’ strong technology heritage.

PRESS RELEASE — PARIS, France — September 19, 2022 — SpeQtral, a leading provider of satellite quantum communication technology, and Thales Alenia Space, a joint Venture between Thales (67 %) and Leonardo (33 %), today announced that it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (“MoU”) to research, develop and demonstrate quantum communications from space to Earth.

Quantum information networks are currently being heavily researched and developed. The industry has seen rapid development of quantum computing and quantum sensing technologies, with the promise of bringing a step change in performance improvements. In order to realise the full potential of such technologies, there will be a need to transfer quantum information across distances of varying ranges. Using satellites to transfer quantum information is actively being pursued as one of the best methods to realise long-distance quantum communications.

As part of this MOU, joint experiments will be carried out, between the SpeQtral-1 quantum satellite — currently being developed — and a state-of-the-art quantum ground receiver currently being developed by Thales Alenia Space. The joint experiments are anticipated to be completed by 2025.

Primed to be one of the first few quantum satellite missions to be launched by a commercial entity, SpeQtral-1 is anticipated to be used to demonstrate the feasibility of long-distance transfer of quantum information, as well as interconnections between various metropolitan quantum networks which are currently being set up.

Thales Alenia Space established in 2018 and has been executing since then a roadmap towards the mastery of end-to-end quantum communications. This roadmap is fully aligned to SpeQtral’s. Beyond satellites, end to end leads Thales Alenia Space to consider ground stations and overall mission segments relying on a strong telecom system integrator expertise, development on optical terminals and the two-decade experience of Thales in quantum communications.

The collaboration, which will likely involve a consortium of other relevant French technology partners as well, provides an excellent platform for both countries to collaborate and conduct joint experiments, leveraging on the respective counterparts’ strong technology heritage. This will enable all parties to innovate at the frontier of quantum information networks.

“This collaboration is an important demonstration of international interoperability of quantum communication assets, a step along the path leading to global quantum information networks. Thales Alenia Space’s optical ground systems promise very high performance and we very much look forward to working with them,” said Chune Yang Lum, Co-founder and CEO of SpeQtral.

We are excited to be working with SpeQtral in these developments towards global quantum information networks,” said Christophe VALORGE, CTO, Thales Alenia Space. “Together with SpeQtral, we have a great opportunity to experiment the quantum communications infrastructure of the future.”

“The SonoFlash is unique in that it integrates both low frequency active and passive sonars into a single system. It is 3-4 times as effective in terms of coverage as the Directional Command Activated Sonobuoy System.”

Francois Merlo, Thales Senior Sales Manager for Asia

“We think this is one of the system’s greatest advantages. Its small size means that it can be deployed from constrained platforms, such as drones.” said Merlo.

Thales won in January 2021 a DGA (French defence procurement agency) contract for the development, qualification and mass production of the new SonoFlash sonobuoy. This game changing active-passive sonobuoy is a strategic tool to complement the ASW systems currently deployed by the French Navy, providing France with a sovereign solution for high-performance acoustic buoys. According to Merlo, the SonoFlash will be ready for export by 2025.

“The system is currently in the industrialization phase, with production due to take place within a few years. Our first customer will most likely be the French Navy. Because this platform is so new, we first need to explain the concept to potential international customers like South Korea. Despite this, we think it will likely interest the ROKN. The ROKN already operates our company’s dipping sonar. We are ready to carry out a ‘demonstration plan’ if the ROKN is interested.” Merlo added.

Thales and South Korea’s SonarTech signed a memorandum of understanding at DX Korea on September 21st. Given this, it is likely that the two companies will cooperate on SonoFlash if South Korea does decide to purchase it.

About SonoFlash

SonoFlash by Thales

The SonoFlash was first unveiled at Euronaval in 2018. The French defence procurement agency awarded Thales a contract to “develop, qualify and manufacture” the SonoFlash. Since then, the program has made progress, with Spain’s S. A. Electronica Submarina agreeing to integrate the new Thales SonoFlash sonobuoy on their acoustic sonobuoy processor in 2021.

Thales’ Sono-Flash is based on Thales Australia’s Barra Sonobuoy System, a standardized Type A sonobuoy that is roughly 1 m long and 10 cm in diameter."

Singapore’s Mass Rapid Transit (SMRT) systems runs on traction power that is inherently green and offers an environmentally sustainable alternative for the nation’s residents.

The Automatic Train Control system, developed by Thales during the re-signalling of the North-South and East-West (NSEW) lines, integrates Smart and Green Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) algorithms.

These Green CBTC algorithms enable an automated, driverless train following optimised curves to save energy while improving punctuality, making Singapore’s oldest rail network more reliable and sustainable.

This partnership between Thales and SMRT Trains to further develop the next generation Green CBTC aims to evaluate the operational effectiveness of its green features using data analytics, and to expand the potential uses of such intelligent application to reduce traction energy of the NSEW lines by 15%.

Thales’s SelTracTM CBTC signalling system first entered service on the NSEW lines in 2017 and has since increased the reliability of the signalling system and enhanced the passenger experience. As the NSEW lines are managed by CBTC signalling, the traction-related actions of acceleration, braking and coasting are controlled by the Automatic Train Operation (ATO) system.

Since its entry into service, Thales’s Automatic Train Control (ATC) system running on these lines has introduced smart algorithms that determine how a train is controlled, following optimised running curves to achieve best energy-saving results with negligible impact on travel time.

For instance, coasting techniques – where the electricity supply to the train's traction motors is shut off and the brakes are not applied – are used between stations in predefined locations which have been carefully identified to optimise environmental performance. Line topography and train speeds at different locations of the MRT lines are fully integrated in the software to maximise the use of train coasting mode and thus save energy.

At present, traction usage constitutes 60% of total energy use on the NSEW lines. The direct impact to energy usage on the NSEW lines from both train movement profiles and operational profiles will be analysed using operational revenue data collected by the SelTracTM CBTC system to continuously improve the algorithms and recommend suitable changes. By improving train movement profiles through the signalling system and making minor modifications to operational procedures, SMRT Trains and Thales are targeting a 15% reduction in traction power, inherently making passenger rides on the NSEW lines greener

“In support of Singapore’s ambitions towards net zero emissions by 2050, Thales is proud to partner SMRT Trains on the next-generation Green CBTC Project This serves as a testament to how Thales is working closely with our local customers to provide cutting-edge technology solutions to real-world challenges. Through this collaboration, we’re excited to provide more reliable and greener passenger journeys for Singapore’s commuters.” Emily Tan, Country Director & Chief Executive, Thales in Singapore

“This joint development of the Next-Generation Green CBTC system on NSEWL is a project that shows SMRT’s commitment to long-term sustainability and net-zero emissions. We are glad to partner Thales to enable energy-optimised train operations. In view of rising electricity costs, any reduction of energy usage in our operations will contribute to greater productivity and financial sustainability.” Lam Sheau Kai, President, SMRT Trains

Over the last decade, Thales has reinforced its position as a leading transportation provider for ticketing, communication and signalling solutions in Singapore. In February 2022, Thales and SMRT Trains signed a Memorandum of Understanding to collaborate and leverage digital technologies such as data analytics to enhance rail maintenance and operations and deliver reliable and sustainable rides in Singapore. This Green CBTC initiative is the latest illustration of the strong partnership between Thales and local rail operator to make green railway journeys a reality. The project also marks the 10-year anniversary of Thales's selection by SMRT to provide its renowned signalling solutions for Singapore’s oldest rail lines."

To coincide with European Sustainable Development Week, Thales is publishing its new Digital Ethics Charter, which sets out the Group’s 10 commitments for digital responsibility. Raphaël de Cormis, VP, Innovation and Digital Transformation and CEO of the Thales Digital Factory, discusses the background and vision behind Thales’s approach to digital technology.

The digital revolution is creating a wealth of opportunities in so many sectors and industries. But it’s also creating its fair share of concerns, real and imagined. Why it is important to take a more ethical and responsible approach to digital technology?

The digital revolution is radically transforming the way we do business and go about our daily lives. But this shift has also piqued our imaginations: as a society, we’ve constructed this science-fiction future in which these new virtual spaces fascinate and terrify us in equal measure. In part, this attitude stems from the fact that digital technology is largely associated with the Silicon Valley culture of libertarianism and transformation, and the idea that the digital revolution should bring about rapid and momentous change. With the current narrative casting the so-called tech giants as untameable monsters devouring everything in their path, it’s easy to understand why many people see this new world as more of a jungle than a properly regulated space where everyone can flourish and thrive. Social media and government efforts to regulate their content are adding fuel to the controversy. At Thales, we take a different view: we see the digital sphere as a space that lends itself to rationality grounded in science and evidence, and that’s consistent with the European values handed down from the Age of Enlightenment. For this reason, we believe a more “responsible” approach is not only desirable but critical. Digital technologies should be conceived not as an instrument of subjugation, but rather as a way to enrich our society and raise our standard of living according to the rules we set.

Digital ethics isn’t a new subject for Thales. Why has the Group chosen 2022 as the year to publish a new charter?

We started thinking about digital ethics and governance as soon as we began using these technologies in our projects. Over time, and with the benefit of experience, we’ve developed a huge number of processes and thought long and hard about how to put new technologies to good use. To take one example, we have long recognized their potential to drive down size, weight and power consumption (SWaP), and we’ve made consistent progress on this front ever since. Practices like these have emerged across the Group, without necessarily following a single policy or set of guidelines. So our first reason for developing a charter was to pull all these initiatives together as a matter of urgency and to provide a framework that charts the way forward, sets expectations and lets us measure progress against recognised metrics.

The second major reason is that the charter is a public statement of Thales’s commitment to using digital technology in a responsible, ethical and environmentally friendly way. The partners and stakeholders that make up the Group's ecosystem are showing a growing interest in CSR-related issues, and some customers are even prizing ESG criteria over technical performance! If we are to fulfil our purpose of “building a future we can all trust”, we have no option but to commit unequivocally to digital responsibility.

How can digital technologies help us meet the challenges ahead?

Digital responsibility is essential if we are to meet two major challenges. The first of these has to do with social stability. Digital technologies are creeping into every aspect of our lives, from how we communicate with one another and manage financial transactions, for example, to how we vote or prove our identity as citizens. The systems behind these processes – both digital and physical – need to be robust, reliable and stable. And that means staying permanently ahead of the curve. Thales is leading from the front on fundamental research in these areas. For instance, our identity management and data protection technologies help protect 80% of banking transactions worldwide. And right now, we’re developing new algorithms that will maintain this degree of protection in the upcoming era of post-quantum cryptography.

Another example relates to the spectacular progress in artificial intelligence we’ve seen in recent times. At Thales, as we look to harness the power of data to drive human performance, we’re developing ""explainable"" AI systems and algorithms that eliminate discriminatory bias and seek to create a level playing field for all users. Our biometric solutions, which use facial recognition technologies, are a case in point.

The second major challenge that calls for digital responsibility is, of course, the environment – an area where Thales is working hard on many fronts.

With European Sustainable Development Week beginning, can you give us some practical examples of what Thales is doing on the environment?

Digital technologies present an immense opportunity to shrink the carbon footprint of our business activities. For example, we’ve reduced our power consumption by as much as 88% by moving part of our information systems to the cloud, and we have a policy of working with cloud providers that use energy from renewable sources. In the aerospace industry, which accounts for a significant share of our business, we’ve deployed digital solutions that optimise flight paths and air traffic control, reduce vapour trails [which form behind the engines at high altitude and have a significant climate impact – ed.] and make aircraft cockpits “smart” and more environmentally friendly.

The other big benefit of digital technologies is that they will allow us to develop eco-designed products and services that are more environmentally responsible throughout their lifecycles. From the earliest design phase, we strive to use less-polluting raw materials, impose traceability requirements all along the supply chain, and use digital twins to simulate the lifecycle of our products and services so we can anticipate their potential impact. Taken together, these measures are helping us to shrink the overall environmental footprint of all our new products. This kind of thinking comes naturally for a company like Thales, which is accustomed to working on long-term projects where repairability and lifecycle management are key priorities. But going forward, we want to do more than just adopt responsible, sustainable practices. We’re looking to embed this approach within all our designs and make eco-design the norm. And we’ll be relying on digital technologies to make that happen."

Thales Alenia Space has been working hand in hand with ESA and the entire European space industry since the start of the European Commission’s Copernicus program, in which it is playing a key role on 11 out of 12 missions. To name a few, Thales Alenia Space is aboard five of the six new-generation Copernicus missions, leading three as prime contractor (CIMR, ROSE-L and CHIME), and supplying the payloads for two more (CO2M and CRISTAL). These new satellites are geared toward measuring human-induced atmospheric CO2 emissions, monitoring thickness of sea ice and snow covering it, supporting new optimized services for sustainable farming and biodiversity, observing sea-surface temperature and salinity as well as sea ice concentration, and strengthening land monitoring and emergency management services. Thales Alenia Space’s involvement in the Copernicus program illustrates its Space for Life vision to build a better and more sustainable life on Earth. This involvement for both a sustainable space and the safeguarding of our planet will also be underlined on the spot during the event!

The key role of satellites in surveying Earth and the impacts of climate change on its environment was in the spotlight a few months ago, during the Prix Bulles Cardin awards — named for the Palais Bulles or “Bubble Palace” owned by the fashion house’s founder Pierre Cardin — that each year distinguish five works, personalities or actions seeking to foster sustainable development. On this occasion, House of Pierre Cardin and Thales Alenia Space underlined their shared belief in the need to focus attention on the climate emergency, notably through satellite imagery.

As you may know, Thales Alenia Space has provided Northrop Grumman with all Pressurized Cargo Modules dedicated to Cygnus resupply vessels. Twice a year, these spacecraft are used to deliver food, fuel, water, science experiments, repair equipment, personal belongings, to the astronauts onboard the International Space Station. Cygnus cargo vessels are equipped with thermal blankets that protect them from the extreme range of temperatures in orbit. These spacecraft will definitely contribute to guarantying a continuous presence of human’s life aboard the International Space Station. Our company provided the House of Pierre Cardin with these particular blankets used on Cygnus. The fashion designer brilliantly created a dress using this unexpected material. A space dress for real! And it will be visible on or booth. Isn’t it amazing?

Some unexpected encounters, such as that between Pierre Cardin and Thales Alenia Space, open up new avenues for raising public awareness of the urgent need to develop a profitable and virtuous ecology.

nd in Neustadt before making its way to InnoTrans in Berlin. A challenge called #SpotLucy, was launched where people could take a picture of the Lucy train and share it on social media. For the first time, Thales’ rolling laboratory train Lucy has travelled to InnoTrans to demonstrate the company’s pioneering autonomous technologies. The trip began on September 2in Neustadt before making its way to InnoTrans in Berlin. A challenge called #SpotLucy, was launched where people could take a picture of the Lucy train and share it on social media.

Built in 1994, Lucy is Thales’ rolling laboratory for testing on-board railway systems. Lucy is also equipped with a multitude of autonomous technologies

Thanks to its Train Control Management System (TCMS), Driver Assistant System, remote video control with GSM-R / 4G / 5G cellular equipment and position and location sensors, Lucy can determine its precise location and speed by itself. Furthermore, in the future, these technologies will enable it to detect, recognise and respond to objects in front of the train.

Autonomy delivers both energy savings and performance enhancements leading to improved punctuality.Rail travel consumes 12 times less energy and emits up to 11 times less CO₂ per passenger / kilometre compared to cars and trucks. (IEA tracking report. Rail. November 2021)





Autonomous technology gives trains new super powers. Imagine if your train could see and think for itself. It sounds like science fiction, but thanks to Thales, trains with autonomous capabilities are already becoming a reality. RailBot™, the Thales autonomous solution, enables a train to interpret its surroundings, make decisions and drive itself according to its mission, without any need for human intervention. We are not there yet, but several of the building blocks for autonomous operation are already being deployed or nearing maturity.

On-board Passenger Density Information and Video Security

Passenger information and video surveillance on trains provide enhanced comfort for travellers. Thales’ solution leverages existing CCTV networks at stations and on-board trains to provide real-time information on passenger density. Thales’ Video Analytics solution is based on a unique hardware embedded platform supporting advanced artificial intelligence algorithms. The solution monitors passenger density in order to balance efficiently the flow of passengers along train carriages. Thanks to real-time passenger information displays, travellers are oriented towards the less crowded carriages. Additionally, the Thales solution helps remote operators to manage crowds by adapting train scheduling through the Thales digital integrated platform. The system supervises the Wayside & Onboard subsystems remotely in real time from an Operation Control Centre (OCC), controlling passenger density, saving energy and improving customer satisfaction. The use of 5G, the new generation of radio communications, enables the implementation of optimised telecommunications infrastructures, tailored to railway operators’ needs. 5G significantly boosts the performance and reliability of communications, with greater speed transmissions (up to 100x faster than 4G), very low latency and a greater capacity to connect multiple intelligent devices onto one network. 5G also enables innovative core elements of railways, including autonomous systems and smart maintenance.

RailBot™ APS – Advanced Positioning System

The innovative Advanced Positioning System is being tested as a new technology to ensure precise position detection of a vehicle, and includes sensors, such as IMU, GNSS, radars, etc. To heighten precision quality, so called ground truth techniques were added such as continuous GNSS-real time kinematic tracing or Eurobalise points. The test drives are being carried out with Thales’ own test vehicle Lucy, which offers ideal conditions as a test platform (installation of sensors etc.). In August 2021, the test route was fully topologically mapped, with infrastructure being measured with centimeter precision using a system consisting of LIDAR, GPS and cameras. A digital map (HD map) is created from this data, which serves as reference for testing the APS sensors as well as other future systems.

RailBot™ Eye - Obstacle detection

Obstacle detection is the ability to detect, classify and respond to objects in front of (and around) the train using sensors and sophisticated computer algorithms. Obstacle detection is a core feature in a fully autonomous and driverless system. This Thales solution provides trains with a new visual sense using Artificial Intelligence to navigate autonomously in an “open-world environment”. It will be used in normal traffic, as the train will be able to distinguish between relevant types of obstacles and determine the level of risk in order to take the right decision.

“Autonomy is still a work in progress with technologies that are maturing rapidly. Thales has a clear vision for autonomy and is working in partnership with its customers and partners to deliver the transformation."" - Dr. Yves Joannic, VP Main Line Signalling Managing Director, Ground Transportation Systems Thale

Autonomy delivers both energy savings and performance enhancements that make rail more attractive to passengers. Taking the train is an attractive alternative to journeys by road, with railways consuming 12 times less energy and emiting up to 11 times less CO₂ per passenger / kilometre compared with cars and trucks.

Thales and voestalpine Railway Systems will combine their outstanding expertise in rail system for a fully digital next generation of points, which are key elements in the railway infrastructure.

This new digital points will enhance the railway signaling system, making rail transport more efficient and safer.

With an all-in-one approach, the digital point will become an intelligent outdoor element that allows all kind of diagnostics for highest availability and efficient predictive maintenance.

The digital switch is an essential building block on the way to fully digitalised railway operations management.

In the course of InnoTrans 2022, the world's largest trade fair focused on the rail transport industry in Berlin, voestalpine Railway Systems, world-market leader in railway systems, and Thales, a global player in the field of ground transportation systems, sign an agreement of cooperation for the joint development of the new generation of digital points.

Future mobility relies on an attractive rail transport. This results in enormous demands with regards to operational availability of the existing railway infrastructure in order to enable the desired, significant increases in capacity. Particularly this applies to the switches as a neuralgic element of the rail infrastructure.

With the Thales solution for a decentralised control unit, the switch becomes a fully digitalised, intelligent outdoor element that, among other things, provides diagnostic data directly at the point. The EULYNX-compliant interface corresponds to the standardised solution according to European standards and thus enables flexible, supplier-independent integration into modern, digital interlocking systems in the future.

Railway infrastructure operators benefit from this integrated approach as it simplifies significantly the installation and integration of the turnout systems into the signaling technology. Real-time diagnostic information ensures that unplanned maintenance activities are minimised, thereby optimising the operational availability of the rail infrastructure.

Thales massively invests in digitalisation in all business areas. Railways rely on digitalisation in order to sufficiently cope with the immense future challenges and demands. We are therefore very proud to further contribute accelerating the digitalisation process of railways through our partnership with voestalpine.

How's your on-board digital mission resilience? - Thales,"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUtZGVmZW5jZS9uYXZhbC1mb3JjZXMvbWFnYXppbmUvaG93cy15b3VyLWJvYXJkLWRpZ2l0YWwtbWlzc2lvbi1yZXNpbGllbmNl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Battle damage repair is all about maintaining power to command. It’s about fixing only that which takes priority to make the mission a success. Say your frigate is taking heavy damage. The key to success may be keeping control over your fire control systems. It may be keeping your radar systems operational. The mission resilience of your naval systems can depend on many things, because it is built upon many domains – one of which is your cyber security. Definitively on the rise, cyber warfare at sea can throw a major wrench in your plans if you don’t have the proper digital defences in place - just like you would for the rest of your ship. Let’s take a look at your digital mission resilience!

© Thales

‘Hacking’ is no longer something that only takes place on land, or that solely affects land-based assets. More and more state actors have discovered that cyber attacks can be a relatively cheap way to test and affect the operational capabilities of other countries – including their navies. The most nefarious ‘hacks’ don’t even need to happen in real-time. Malware may have been placed during maintenance, or snuck in while at a foreign harbour. A usb stick here, an unexpected click there, and it’s done. A small bit of software may lay dormant until you try to use your tracking radar or your gun, resulting in it being off by a few degrees. Just enough to cause problems, but not enough to notice right away – possibly placing your mission and the safety of your crew in danger.

Anti-Cyber Warfare works differently at sea than it would in a Security Operations Center (SOC) on land, because it needs to be embedded into the operational Navy context. There are no cyber experts on board of most navy vessels, and many Navies indicates they don’t expect this to be a viable option in the future. Connectivity with land cyber experts might be difficult or impossible given networks bandwidths or mission conditions. A quick response to maintain mission aim is key; full recovery can take place later with cyber experts in the harbor.

If crucial parts of your ship are in need of repair or about to be damaged, you want to be able to respond accordingly. If there’s a fire, you’ve got your firefighting gear in place. If a cable gets fried, you can switch it out with a new one. But since cyberwarfare is a relatively new threat, most navies don’t have specialized protocols in place to deal with cyberthreats. That is what we at Thales set out to solve. We know the naval field like the back of our hand, so combined with our expertise in naval systems and cyber security, our naval digital mission resilience approach is ahead of the pack!

Anti Cyber Warfare Work set

Anti-Cyber Warfare consists of three steps. The first is knowing your enemy: what are the kinds of attacks you can expect, and what is the potential impact of their damage? The second is being able to identify the problem once it happens, preferably as fast as possible. Last but not least: patching the problem, so your mission will not be affected – or at a minimum so that effects on the mission can be reduced as much as possible.

Based on these defence fundamentals, our naval cyber department has created a specialized workset that can be added to your combat management system, such as TACTICOS by Thales. The way this workset works is based upon extensive research done by our teams. We’ve analysed and defined countless software specific patterns found on naval ships, in order to be able to detect suspicious behaviour and/or intrusions. For instance, one of these patterns can be the fact that during the day, way more users log into the ship’s systems than at night. That means when a certain user logs in during the night, the system might flag that as an anomaly. Pattern detection could also flag something much more obvious, like your radar turning on by itself in an area where you’d usually keep it turned off.

Basic training

The Anti-Cyber Warfare Workset enables you to detect specific mission system incidents and anomalies, and generates in response a set of mitigation options. It’s similar to a recipe book or a helpdesk script, where you don’t have to be an expert to get to expert results. Such a solid Cyber Battle Damage Repair protocol on board will help you reduce the chance of cyber-attacks as well of their possible impact. It will enable the commander to choose which response fits the current command aim best more quickly and more easily, which can then be implemented by the operator.

Newer updates (soon available) of our workset will include more ways for the commander to choose from to remedy a particular problem. Such as, for instance in the case of a misfiring canon, turning that specific software program off so it cannot be misused. Or resetting the software to a previous back-up, to let it bypass any malware and run smoothly again.

Dealing with cyber security issues will need to become part of on-board procedures. In this changing world, we recommend including cyber warfare awareness into basic training. Learning to work with workset will be a piece of cake for your operators, as we’ve specifically designed it for naval purposes and to be easy to use. Working together with you and our other customers, we’re speeding up the journey towards improved, futureproof mission resilience!

This article is part of the interview series ‘Safeguarding your strength @sea’, where we look behind the scenes of cyber security in the naval domain.

Also, Mary Writz has joined the executive leadership team at Sift, and Socure has promoted Jordan Burris to the position of vice president of public sector strategy.

Thales expands North American team

The company made the announcement in a blog post last week, confirming its recruiters in North America have already hired almost 1,000 new employees and plan to hire up to 300 more before the end of the year.

“Thales continues to strive to build a robust and engaged professional community with a strong sense of purpose, having diversity and inclusion, well-being, growth and development and corporate social responsibility at its core,” says Michelle Forbrigger, VP of human resources at Thales North America, commenting on the news.

“We aim to strengthen the overall employee experience through an environment that fosters growth and innovation through trust and empowerment. At Thales, culture matters!”

The announcement comes months after Thales acquired OneWelcome and weeks after the company appointed Emily Tan as chief executive for Singapore.

Precise Biometrics appoints two new executives

Precise Biometrics’ board of directors has appointed Fredrik Sjöholm as EVP and CCO of Algo and Patrick Höijer as interim CCO of Digital Identity in addition to his role as CEO.

The changes will support the company’s growth strategy and provide a strengthened focus on Precise’s two business segments.

“Precise has a well-defined strategy for growth, including continued development of Algo and to grow [Software-as-a-Service] revenues within Digital Identity,” explains Höijer.

“To support the continued delivery on this strategy, the board has appointed Fredrik Sjöholm to head the Algo business. Fredrik has been vital for the development of Precise during the last couple of years and will be important for the continued development of our Algo business. Additionally, I will head up Digital Identity alongside my role as CEO.”

As a result of the move, EastCoast will reportedly become part of Digital Identity, and the respective R&D functions of EastCoast and YOUNiQ will be combined.

Sjöholm joined Precise in 2016, and was formerly VP of Sales.

Precise Biometrics has also recently deployed its fingerprint algorithm for smart home applications in a partnership with Aqara.

Socure promotes Jordan Burris from senior director to VP

The executive made the announcement on LinkedIn on Monday. He was promoted to his new post from his position as senior director of product market strategy. Before joining Socure, Burris was chief of staff at the U.S. Office of Management and Budget.

Testing Thales dismounted soldier night vision optronics - EDR Magazine,"Thu, 15 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmV1L3Rlc3RpbmctdGhhbGVzLWRpc21vdW50ZWQtc29sZGllci1uaWdodC12aXNpb24tb3B0cm9uaWNz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paolo Valpolini

Early before Eurosatory EDR On-Line was given the opportunity to test some of the newest Thales soldier night vision systems during a visit to Saint-Héand, the company facility specialised in optics and dismounted soldier optronics, where beside the latter the renowned Angenieux professional cinema lenses, used in the production of most movies, are manufactured.

In late 2021 Thales launched a new day-night rifle sight, the XTRAIM, which couples a daylight channel with an uncooled thermal (TI). While the latter is obviously used at night, it can be also used in daylight, something that is not possible with image intensification (I2) systems. Not only, its peculiar optical architecture allows the soldier wearing I2 night vision goggles to look through the sight, fusing de-facto II and TI at night, while in daylight the fusion is between visual and thermal.

EDR On-Line reported on the XTRAIM in December 2021, and readers looking for technical data can retrieve that story by clicking HERE

click on image to enlarge

The small size of the sight, less than 170 mm long, and its contained weight, under 530 grams with the two CR123 batteries, do no add much to the soldier’s burden when handling his assault rifle, and do not alter the centre of gravity. Considering typical shooting distances, the 1.6 MOA red dot proves to have the right dimensions to deal with a typical human target at a few hundreds meters, the XTRAIM having a x1 magnification.

The first scenario to which we were confronted was in full daylight, a SWAT team being required to acquire targets inside a building. In full light the eyes’ pupils tend to contract as much as possible, to optimise daytime vision, however this prevents from seeing what is happening in dark areas, such as inside the building. Looking in the room through the XTRAIM in daytime mode it was impossible to see any human presence, as all appeared pitch black. Things changed completely once the thermal mode was switched on, as the personnel in the room became immediately visible, their bright shape contrasting with the dark background, while keeping an eye on the external scenario, the system allowing sighting keeping both eyes open, the 14° field of view proving sufficient to easily acquire the target while monitoring the situation around it. The operation was repeated more than once, setting the XTRAIM either in Full IR mode or in Contour mode, the latter providing only the peripheral shape of the target,

Ergonomy was good, although obviously at first a minimum of familiarisation with the sight commands was needed.

The second scenario was a night one, the task being to find a target in a rural area. As said the XTRAIM can be used also when wearing NVGs, and these we worn, which provided a general view of the landscape, but definitely didn’t allowed to pick-up a human being hiding in the night. Scanning the ground ahead of us looking through the XTRAIM in thermal mode it was relatively easy to notice the signature of a body, here too the 14° FoV proving adequate to the task, sufficiently wide for search and narrow enough for aiming. The thermal channel proved to be key in unmasking the targets in both scenarios, giving an edge to the operator, and this capability will soon be available, Thales planning to start delivering its XTRAIM sight in 2023.

Using an NVG, in conjunction with the XTRAIM thermal sight, proved very effective. However this is not the first time Thales couples TI with another channel to improve performances. Over one decade ago the company unveiled an NVG that possesses both I2 and TI channels, the Minie-DIR, and although not a new product, it was interesting testing it at night in the central France countryside. A four-people “recce patrol” was launched to search for a friendly individual that was known to be lying relatively close to a dirt track. Four different NVGs were issued, and EDR On-Line had the chance to get the Minie-DIR, which is a Minie-D NVG fitted with an IR module. Once the helmet harness is correctly set the typical unbalance felt due to the weight of the NVG is relatively reduced, as the Minie is pretty compact, only 77 mm depth, the weight of the “DIR” version being 490 grams with batteries.

click on image to enlarge

The I2 channel exploits a single tube of the latest generation; compared to NVGs fitted with older tubes tested in the past the image quality is definitely much better. A single-tube system, it of course lacks the stereoscopic effect of a two-tube NVG, but the image quality of latest generation intensification tubes allows walking easily, at least on a relatively simple ground. The image captured and amplified by the tube is split on two oculars, and provides a 51° field of view. This wide FoV avoids the user from totally losing peripheral view, and it is incredible how much a 10° extra FoV makes it much more comfortable to move around, even in a group of people walking close to each other. Moving the head right and left to cover the full frontal arc, the TI FoV is 35.8° diagonal thus narrower than that provided by the I2, the thermal signature of the person we were looking for showed up immediately when he came in sight. The Minie-DIR was set on Contour mode, which allows exploiting I2 for walking and TI for searching, and also helps in identifying the target. Of course none of those who were wearing basic I2 NVGs picked up the target. Thales underlines that the system modularity, the IR module that weighs 120 grams can be installed on any Minie-D, allows to provide it only a limited number of soldiers in the fire team, thus reducing cost.

Coupling the two technologies, image intensification and thermal imaging, is more and more common, and it was good being able to verify in real on the field the advantages of that solution, and to witness the progress made in soldiers optronics by Thales.

Railways can play a vital role in mitigating climate change while supporting the economy and connecting communities. Indeed, what makes railway so important, and so attractive, is that they can enable economic growth while being one of the high-volume modes of transportation. Thales digital solutions support our customers in further reducing their carbon emissions and help them supervise their networks, monitor traffic, ensure safety, cut energy consumption, boost ridership and transform every part of the passenger experience.

Digital solutions from Thales contribute to green mobility by reducing CO 2 emissions by metro systems by up to 15%.

For metros, Thales latest Communications-Based-Train-Control (CBTC) signalling system SelTrac TM G8 will enable to reduce traction energy consumption by 15% when compared to traditional CBTC by loading efficient speed profiles into the train’s onboard system.

The Smart and Green CBTC algorithms enable an automated, driverless train that follows optimized curves to save energy while improving punctuality.

Metros provide an insight into the potential for creating extra capacity when modern digital signalling is used. Communications-based train control (CBTC) signalling is based on the moving block principle, whereby safe separation between trains is governed by speed rather than fixed geographical blocks.

Converting the existing signalling of a metro line to CBTC can deliver capacity gains of 20-40%. Given that CBTC systems are typically implemented on routes that are already operating at or near their maximum capacity under conventional signalling, these gains are highly significant.

In light of skyrocketing energy costs and government initiatives around the world to meet carbon emission targets, Thales has been working closely with metro transport operators in major global cities to deliver a green mobility through energy savings with its inherently Green CBTC solution. Now Thales is embarking on its next generation to achieve increased optimization in rail operation.

Thales SelTrac™ CBTC’s Automatic Train Control system, already integrates smart Green CBTC algorithms. These algorithms enable trains following optimised running curves to save energy while improving punctuality. Thales next generation Green CBTC projects aim to evaluate operational effectiveness of these green features using data analytics, and further expand the breadth and depth of intelligent applications to improve traction energy efficiency."

In September, Thales Alenia Space organized its sixth flagship innovation contest, #HelloSpace6, held in the impressive grounds of Queens College, Oxford UK. Over 3 days, 54 of our colleagues, coming from different sites, have provided 11 outstanding groundbreaking concepts based on the theme of this edition:

Toward a deep space ecosystem!

The 11 teams were asked to imagine for a moment that they were in 2050; humans are living on different celestial bodies. The Moon for sure was the first. All started with NASA’s ARTEMIS program in the 2010’s, aiming to bring astronauts back to the Moon, nearly 50 years after the Apollo missions. A lot of people had decided to leave the Earth to settle down on Mars. Oh yeah we forgot to tell you: in the 2020’s and 2030’s the Moon became an outpost to prepare manned space exploration mission across the solar system. Engineers, from different space agencies, settled down around and on the Moon’s surface. A cislunar space station was created, Lunar Gateway. Orion, NASA’s manned capsule was the spacecraft used to bring astronauts from the Earth to the Moon, and from the Moon to deep space. There was a real lunar space economy that was created from scratch around the Moon, including human landing systems, shelters, habitats for astronauts, solar panels to generate energy, systems to provide oxygen to astronauts, rovers and many more. Engineers had even created telecommunications and navigation space systems around the Moon.

Can you just imagine that? What was before sci-fi had become reality. The planet Mars became really trendy in the 2040’s.

The Martian colony had recently completed its first permanent habitation structures and is ready to grow from the few hundred scientists and engineers based there now to a colony of a size to rival the Moon in the next decade. Away from the planets the asteroid belt is a hive of activity with asteroid mining companies mining water and precious metals from a wealth of different asteroids. It is all centrally managed from a control hub on Ceres manned by a small group of engineers. Those Mars and Ceres bases are also good starting points for further destinations in the Solar System, such as Io, Europe, Ganymède, Callisto, Titan, Rhéa, Japet...

The Moon remaining the first choice base for missions towards Venus, Mercury and the Sun. However, this swarm of human activities in space beyond the terrestrial orbits came with specific issues, some of which were not new: extension of existing geopolitical tensions on Earth to the outer space area; intensification of public / private co-opetition; legal issues with regard to territory and resource ownership, nationality of human born in space; long term subsistence and autonomy; space missions and living cost reduction; logistics; space traffic management… and many other ones that you can imagine!

In 2050 Thales Alenia Space has become an undisputed leader of this Deep Space Economy. This success story started in 2022, when a small team of Innovation Fellows pitched their bold vision with a short term action plan to make it concrete and real!

End of story. Astonishing story don’t you think?

Travelling back to the Earth.

Based on this inspiring brief and keynotes from Sam Adlen of the Satellite Applications Catapult, the teams had 2 days to come up with new products and business plans that would help Thales Alenia Space thrive in this new environment, allowing it to become an undisputed leader of the deep space economy by 2050. The 11 teams produced a wide range of ideas, and, with the help of internal coaches, crafted them into interesting and innovative pitches which resulted in a difficult decision for the panel of judges tasked with selecting the best one (the judging panel was made up of internal and external stakeholders with extensive experience and knowledge of the space economy).

84% of IT professionals have some degree of confidence in their user access security systems to enable remote work securely and easily, up from 56% in 2021

IT professionals with very high concerns about the security risks of remote work decreased to 31% from 39% in 2021

Multi-Factor Authentication adoption increasing internally but still not used by a significant majority of businesses worldwide

After two years of the pandemic, confidence in addressing certain security risks and threats arising from hybrid and remote work has improved among businesses and organizations around the world. When it comes to secure access to applications, data, and systems, 84% IT professionals this year said they have some degree of confidence in their current user access security systems to enable remote work securely and easily, compared to 56% in 2021. In addition, 60% said this year they were highly confident compared to just 22% last year.

These are among some of the key findings from the 2022 Thales Access Management Index, a global survey of 2,600 IT decision makers, conducted by 451 Research, part of S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Firms Gaining Confidence Addressing Security of Remote Work

Overall, the report findings suggest that firms remain concerned about the security risks of remote work, but those concerns seem to be less severe. At the same time, firms are also growing more confident in the ability of authentication and access management systems to manage those risks. Only 31% of IT professional surveyed reported having “very high” concerns about the security risks and threats of remote work in 2022, down from 39% in 2021, while those who said they were “somewhat concerned” – the most popular response – increased from 43% to 48% in 2022.

Multi-Factor Authentication on the Rise But Not Widespread

While multi-factor authentication (MFA) usage remains most prevalent for remote workers (68%) and privileged users (52%), the report shows that MFA adoption is on the rise for internal and non-IT staff with MFA adoption increasing to 40% compared to 34% in 2021. However, widespread MFA adoption by businesses is still yet to be the norm with just over half (56%) have adopted MFA in their organizations.

Lingering Effects of Pandemic Drive Interest in Access Management, MFA and ZTNA

The survey inquired about direct impacts that the pandemic and remote work had on deployment plans for new access security technologies. Responses revealed a six-percentage-point global increase in plans to deploy stand-alone MFA, up from 31% in 2021. The pandemic also impacted plans to deploy cloud-based access management, selected by 45% of respondents worldwide compared to 41% in 2021. These two increases illustrate respondents’ growing awareness that threats come from all angles, and that proper authentication and management of access and privileges is necessary for an adequate security foundation. Last year, Zero Trust Network Access/Software-Defined Perimeter (ZTNA)/(SDP) was the top choice, selected by 44% of respondents. In 2022, ZTNA was the second choice at 42%.

Francois Lasnier, Vice President of Access Management Solutions at Thales comments: “The past few years have cemented remote work and work-from-anywhere as a permanent part of the security landscape, and they have also introduced new security risks and challenges. However, growing familiarity with remote work has ultimately broadened awareness on an enterprise level of daily business security risks and has strengthened both confidence and ability in security teams and products to handle those risks and threats properly.”

Garrett Bekker, Principal Analyst at 451 Research comments: “Just as the threat landscape has evolved, the tools and methods to handle the landscape have, too. However, even with innovative tools and boosted confidence levels, security plans and approaches still need to adapt to the ever-changing threat environment. A greater shift towards a Zero Trust model would place access management in a central role in corporate security strategies, with a related reliance on MFA as a critical supporting enabler.”

Thales and 451 Research will discuss the findings in more detail during a webinar on 29 September 2022. To join, please visit the registration page.

About the 2022 Thales Access Management Index

As organizations step beyond the urgent actions of the last two years, they’re grappling with securing the more complex environments in which they now operate. The global edition of the 2022 Thales Access Management Index looked at various aspects of those impacts in a wide-ranging survey of security professionals and executive leadership that touched on issues including access management and access security, multi-factor authentication, zero-trust network access, security spending plans, remote work and VPNs, and ransomware. The 2022 Thales Access Management Study is based on data from a survey of nearly 2,800 security professionals and executive leaders in more than 15 countries across the globe. This research was conducted as an observational study and makes no causal claims."

Skin in the game - how two Lithgow apprentices put themselves in the customer's shoes - Thales,"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGFsZXNncm91cC5jb20vZW4vY291bnRyaWVzLWFzaWEvYXVzdHJhbGlhL25ld3Mvc2tpbi1nYW1lLWhvdy10d28tbGl0aGdvdy1hcHByZW50aWNlcy1wdXQtdGhlbXNlbHZlcy1jdXN0b21lcnMtc2hvZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Australia employees Josh Winter and Angus Carrigan both began their apprenticeships at our Lithgow site in January 2019 and have fully immersed themselves in the business - even completing a five-week basic Army Reserve training at Kapooka to gain a true appreciation of the rifle used by our customer!

Josh Winter

Business Improvement Manager David Forbes says Angus and Josh are the first apprentices to volunteer to join up as Army Reserves in his 31 years of looking after the apprenticeship program at Lithgow. “Both guys approached me and said they wanted to serve their country not only in the manufacture of Small Arms but also in the field,” says David. He was fully supportive of their aspirations and believes there’s real benefit for our staff to experience our products from a user’s perspective instead of solely as a manufacturer.

The training – located near Wagga Wagga – is not for the faint hearted and involved 16-hour days, seven days a week. The jam-packed schedule included Combat First Aid, Basic Firearms training, Army Combatitives program (hand to hand combat), radio operations, navigation, extensive fitness training, marching & drills, functions and history of Australian Army. The aim of the game was to instil teamwork and discipline among the trainees but for Angus and Josh their training drill was so much more meaningful. The opportunity to experience the rifle from the customer’s perspective has further fuelled their already abundant passion for what they do at Thales.

Born and raised in Melbourne, Josh bid farewell to his family and friends at age 17 to begin his apprenticeship at Lithgow with only his black kelpie dog, Sasha, in tow. For Josh, pursuing a career at Thales was a no-brainer.

I’ve always had a passion for the history of manufacture of military firearms. Where else would I learn more and be involved in the next generation of Australian made Infantry rifles than at Thales?"" Josh Winter, Apprentice at Thales Australia

Angus also knew at a young age he was destined to work with firearms.

My dad has always been a responsible shooter, he used to compete in clay pigeons shooting in Scotland. I have been shooting since the age of 12. My ideal job was always to be doing something with firearms. An apprenticeship at Lithgow Arms is all I wanted to do.""

Angus Carrigan

Josh and Angus are both completing a CERT IV in Engineering Mechanical trade, which runs for four years. While a typical day in the life of a Lithgow apprentice varies, each apprentice is given a number of competencies and tasks to complete. The core skill for a mechanical engineering trade apprentice is precision machining, working to fine tolerance (.005 microns or equivalent to one twentieth of the thickness of a piece of A4 paper) and Computer Numerical Control machining. Other activities include Metal Treatment, Metrology, Assembly and test and evaluation of the products serviced and manufactured at Lithgow Arms.

Our Lithgow business currently has nine apprentices and they form an important part of the team’s culture. As David points out, apprenticeships are a big part of Lithgow’s history and many of today’s technical, engineering and middle management on site started out as apprentices."

Rail transportation is widely known as an excellent alternative for energy efficiency. Thales has developed an Automatic Train Control system, which uses smart and efficient algorithms. These algorithms enable a driverless train to follow optimized running curves - to save energy while improving punctuality.

In partnership with RTA, Thales has achieved significant energy savings on Dubai Metro lines. The percentage achieved in real Dubai Metro operation conditions has reached 15%.

In service since 2009, the Dubai Metro is the longest driverless metro in the world, offering optimal life-cycle costs due to low maintenance overheads and operating costs. It is equipped with an entire package of Thales solutions including SelTracTM CBTC signalling solution.

Thales ATC system (Automatic Train Control) has smart algorithms on how an automatic driverless train is driven following optimized running curves to achieve ​ energy savings results with minimum negligible impact on the travel time. It is using ​ coasting techniques in ​ predefined locations between the stations, which are carefully selected and optimized. The topography of the lines and the train speed at different locations of the metro lines are fully integrated in the software getting maximum use of train coasting mode.

In July 2022, Thales demonstrated in partnership with RTA, significant energy savings on Dubai Metro lines. The function is flexible and configurable. The Operator can decide to enable it or disable it. The function can also be used during the preparation of the Timetable and hence energy saving is achieved automatically using a pre-defined Timetable.

The percentage of Energy saving achieved in real Dubai Metro operation conditions has reached 15%. The impact on the travel time is negligible. This is a clear tangible contribution towards minimizing the carbon footprint in the environment, in line with Dubai Government aspirations and directives, and reduces the RTA electricity costs considerably.

This innovation is of paramount importance to RTA and Thales, both partners have shared views and full engagement in reducing their carbon footprint. This concrete and measurable success demonstrate once again both entities environmental social responsibility and commitment to be active actors for a sustainable and greener future.

“We are endeavoring to achieve record levels of sustainability across all metro operations and related facilities. The operation of the metro requires meticulous plans and processes in line with the top globalstandards of the industry to ensure the highest rates of quality, health, safety and environment (QHSE) and enhance the sustainability of operations. Such a drive is also compatible with RTA’s vision to become ‘the World Leader in Seamless & Sustainable Mobility'. Energy saving in any entity constitutes an environmental responsibility and this goal is achievable through a variety of initiatives relating to the maintenance and replacement as well as the investment in power-saving technology.” - Abdul Mohsin Kalbat, CEO of RTA’s Rail Agency

“At Thales UAE, we are working hard to contribute to Thales Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) strategy through three pillars: making the world safer, greener and more inclusive. We are very proud to be working with RTA to support the Vision of its wise leadership to achieve the sustainable development goals. For the UAE, Thales is committed to building a future that we can all trust through industry, innovation and education” - Bernard Roux, CEO of Thales in UAE

This RTA and Thales success is one among other innovations and initiatives that both historical partners are collaborating on, the two entities are continuously striving to realise meaningful technical innovation to increase the metro efficiency, the passenger’s happiness and experience. The new leading technologies such as AI, Machine Learning, Big Data/Predictive Analytics Edge Computing, etc. are thoroughly investigated for concrete applications to the urban rail industry for a smarter, safer and greener future."

U.S.-French Earth science satellite ready to ship for December launch - SpaceNews,"Wed, 07 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS91LXMtZnJlbmNoLWVhcnRoLXNjaWVuY2Utc2F0ZWxsaXRlLXJlYWR5LXRvLXNoaXAtZm9yLWRlY2VtYmVyLWxhdW5jaC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — A joint U.S.-French Earth science mission is ready to be delivered to California for a launch now scheduled for early December, a slight delay caused in part because of transportation issues.

Thales Alenia Space, the prime contractor for the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) spacecraft, said Sept. 6 it is making final preparations to ship the two-ton spacecraft from its factory in Cannes, France, to Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. There, it will be integrated with a SpaceX Falcon 9 for a launch no earlier than Dec. 5.

SWOT, a joint mission of NASA and the French space agency CNES, with participation from the Canadian Space Agency and U.K. Space Agency, will carry out observations for oceanography and hydrology using a synthetic aperture radar, altimeter and other instruments. Scientists plan to use SWOT to conduct a global survey of the Earth’s water, including measuring changes in lakes and rivers as well as ocean currents.

Getting the spacecraft from France, where the NASA-supplied science payload was installed on the Thales-built spacecraft and then tested, to the United States, turned into more than a challenge than once expected.

“We had a slight issue with the transport of it,” said Kathleen Boggs, acting associate director for flight programs in NASA’s Earth science division, at an Aug. 2 advisory committee meeting. “It was supposed to come back on a Ukrainian Antonov aircraft that was provided by CNES.”

Those aircraft, though, have largely been grounded because of sanctions and other issues linked to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Those aircraft had been frequently used before the invasion to transport large satellites that do not fit on other cargo aircraft, and with the planes unavailable, satellite manufacturers have limited options for transporting their spacecraft to launch sites by air.

Boggs said at the meeting that NASA was “pretty close” to an agreement with the U.S. Air Force to transport the spacecraft. In its Sept. 6 release, Thales Alenia said SWOT will be transported to California in early October on a U.S. Air Force C-5 cargo plane “deployed specially” for SWOT.

Using the Air Force to transport the plane, she added, was preferable from a schedule standpoint to using a ship. “If we have to use transport by sea, it could cost us some time and some money, so we’re pushing really hard for the Air Force solution.”

Arranging that alternative transport did contribute to a schedule slip for the launch of SWOT. NASA announced Aug. 25 that the launch, which had previously been scheduled for November, was now planned for Dec. 5. The agency said the delay “was needed in order to complete all the necessary tasks in the lead-up to launch, including transporting the satellite from Cannes, France, to Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.”"

Telit's Acquisitions to Reshape Global IoT Module Market - Counterpoint - Counterpoint Research,"Thu, 01 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdW50ZXJwb2ludHJlc2VhcmNoLmNvbS9pbnNpZ2h0cy90ZWxpdHMtYWNxdWlzaXRpb25zLXJlc2hhcGUtZ2xvYmFsLWlvdC1tb2R1bGUtbWFya2V0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In recent times, Telit has acquired cellular IoT businesses from Thales and Mobilogix. The IoT module market has started consolidating and we expect to see a few more deals in the coming months. In August, we also saw Semtech acquiring Sierra Wireless to offer complete chip-to-cloud solutions to cover the entire IoT value chain. The back-to-back acquisitions by Telit show how it is trying to become an integrated player. With the Mobilogix acquisition, Telit can offer modules, connectivity, security and management platform to design and manufacturing services. It means Telit will act as a one-stop solution provider for its customers. Here, we will try to analyze what these acquisitions mean to Telit and how they will impact the IoT industry.

Telit-Thales deal

Thales is merging its cellular IoT module business into Telit to form a new entity called Telit Cinterion. Thales will own a 25% stake in the newly formed entity and offer SIM technology and security services for IoT modules.

China dominates the global cellular IoT module market by taking more than 55% share. International players are struggling to compete in the operator- and government-driven China IoT module market.

After its deal with Telit, Thales will enjoy less distraction from its module business and will be able to focus on its core business which includes software, security and services. Thales will still continue to provide eSIM services where it is a market leader.

Global Cellular IoT Module Shipments Share by Vendor, Q1 2022

The newly formed company will have a common R&D platform which will help save resources. In the coming times, we may see Telit Cinterion focusing on the IoT platform business to earn revenue on a recurring basis.

Thales has a strong position in Europe and Japan, whereas Telit has a good presence in North America and Latin America. This complementary relationship supports their dream of becoming the #1 cellular IoT player in the international market. Telit-Thales is already leading in the international IoT module market in terms of revenue. With this merger, Telit Cinterion may overtake Quectel in the international market in terms of shipments in the coming years.

Telit has already divested its automotive business in 2018, but Thales has a good customer base for some European automakers. How the joint venture treats this automotive business will be keenly watched. There is ample opportunity in the automotive business with growing connected and autonomous mobility. With the introduction of 5G, Telit may focus on the automotive segment as the automotive module business contributes higher revenue due to a higher average selling price (ASP).

In recent times, Telit has done a great job launching many new modules. This helps Telit to target new regions depending on available technologies and provides an option for customers to select a product as per their requirements.

Telit-Mobilogix deal

Telit moved to acquire Mobilogix, a decade-old end-to-end IoT hardware, software and cloud solution provider to fulfill its ambition of becoming a more integrated player and one of the largest end-to-end white-label solution providers outside China.

Mobilogix’s comprehensive device engineering expertise and resources, which focus on optimizing the specifications for EMS and ODMs, and attainment of regulatory approvals and carrier certification, will help Telit provide solutions to customers with reduced cost and complexity, and faster time to market.

Furthermore, Mobilogix is known for its expertise in customized IoT projects, which provide businesses with solutions in various application verticals that are ready to certify and mass produce. This will help Telit expand its focus in growing segments such as telematics, micro-mobility, healthcare, construction and agriculture.

Chinese module vendors are trying to become integrated players to capture maximum share across the IoT value chain. Telit is also trying to adopt such a model with these recent acquisitions. For example, Quectel is trying to increase its footprint in the North American market with the establishment of a new ODM company, named Ikotek. Similarly, Fibocom established a new ODM company in 2019 for global customers through applications such as gateway, payment terminal, telematics and industrial applications. Telit is slowly becoming vertically integrated and trying to revive back its glory days in the IoT module market.

Solutions from the combined entity will provide a great choice for customers who want to diversify and do not want to depend on the Chinese ecosystem, and need tightly integrated solution expertise from one provider.

If Telit wants to compete head-to-head with Chinese module giants like Quectel and Fibocom, it has to develop an effective business strategy for each international market.

Mobilogix has a wide range of portfolios comprising custom IoT projects and solution design services based on three basic architectures, namely beacon, power and battery-operated architecture. Apart from this, it also offers cloud platform integration and custom firmware, which will add value to Telit’s portfolio not only from cellular but also from BLE beacon hardware designs.

Mobilogix has a global presence across key regions such as the US, China, India and Latin America. Its presence in China and emerging markets like India will help Telit grow its presence in these key regions.

Conclusion

Telit is becoming a more integrated player with these acquisitions and moving up the stack to become an end-to-end solution provider. The convenient and comprehensive solutions will add more value to its customers’ IoT project deployments and will be concurrent with its long-term vision of becoming the #1 international module player in terms of both shipments and revenue.

The acquisitions will help Telit provide solutions to customers from the design/manufacturing of hardware to cloud and security with regional diversification. This will help Telit cater to more application segments, thus improving both revenue and profitability.

However, industry experts will be keenly watching the entire positioning, offering, strategy and business model, which are changing in the IoT space as you need to be a large-scale and end-to-end player to succeed even though it is a blue ocean out there.

Emirates selects Thales AVANT UP IFE System for its Airbus A350 fleet - Economy Class & Beyond - Kevin Marshall,"Thu, 08 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL2Vjb25vbXljbGFzc2FuZGJleW9uZC5ib2FyZGluZ2FyZWEuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvMDgvZW1pcmF0ZXMtc2VsZWN0cy10aGFsZXMtYXZhbnQtdXAtaWZlLXN5c3RlbS1mb3ItaXRzLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLWZsZWV0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Emirates is to introduce some high-quality IFE systems on their upcoming Airbus A350, with the airline selecting Thales’ AVANT Up system with Optiq displays.

As we’ve discovered in this blog, the Thales’ AVANT Up system features Optiq 4k QLED HDR displays – the only aircraft displays using Samsung’s QLED technology to immerse viewers in more than a billion colours.

This will be paired with Emirates ice in-flight entertainment product which delivers over 5,000 channels of multi-language content

The new system from Thales will also provide an enhanced ‘live’ television solution that offers a broader choice of live television and news in the highest available definition at 40,000 feet.

The Optiq display supports two Bluetooth connections, and built-in Wi-Fi for passengers to pair multiple devices including phones, tablets, headphones or even game controllers while supporting up to 60 watts of USB-C to fast-charge personal devices.

To support power delivery to the seat, Emirates will be the first customer of Thales’ Pulse, – a power management technology which will ensure that charging performance will be unaffected no matter how many users are charging their devices at the same time.

The investment comes to over US$ 350 which will be installed on a 50-strong fleet of A350s.

Adel al Redha, Emirates’ Chief Operating Officer said:

“Emirates has always regarded inflight entertainment as an essential aspect of our onboard experience, and we were in fact the first airline to put personal screens onto every single seat onboard when that was far from the norm over 30 years ago. Today, Emirates ice remains unmatched in inflight entertainment content and experience, having won best-in-the-sky awards consecutively for the past 14 years. Our investment in next-generation Thales systems for our new A350 fleet will further our lead, enabling us to deliver even better experiences to our customers. Watch this space.”

Yannick Assouad, Executive Vice-President, Thales Avionics said:

“At Thales we are proud to partner with Emirates in their mission to Fly Better. Thales’ AVANT Up brings to Emirates the latest consumer technologies and capabilities to the aircraft. Combining our Optiq 4K QLED HDR displays, award-winning dynamic power, and next generation digital services, Emirates customers can expect the extraordinary.”

4K goodness is wonderful – driving content to match will be the challenge

I used Optiq seatback, trying out some of the features of the system (not just the display technology), and it is pretty impressive, to put it mildly.

The dual-Bluetooth pairing is great for sharing content or hogging the two connections to yourself with a headset and game controller (and this was a standard Xbox controller being used in this demo).

But the issue won’t be the technology – it will be with content.

We’ve all been on flights, where the content is blocky or stretched, with IFE systems delivering DVD quality content…on a good day (what could be called 480p content). On larger displays, there is some HD content – but it can be a struggle to have suppliers deliver content at the high resolutions needed to play this – as well as the storage servers on the aircraft to deliver this content.

It’ll be interesting to see how Emirates addresses this with their suppliers to deliver HDR and 4K content to the seat – and what its requirements will be.

As well as the size of the storage server.

Thales Australia's Latia Hardie paving the way for the next gen of female tradies - Thales,"Mon, 12 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9jb3VudHJpZXMtYXNpYS9hdXN0cmFsaWEvbmV3cy90aGFsZXMtYXVzdHJhbGlhcy1sYXRpYS1oYXJkaWUtcGF2aW5nLXdheS1uZXh0LWdlbi1mZW1hbGUtdHJhZGllc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Australia's Latia Hardie is a Manufacturing Technician - Machine Setter at the Lithgow Arms site and is the face of a TAFE NSW campaign to promote the career prospects available to women in the engineering trades and manufacturing industry. Latia shares her motivation for joining the female talent pool that makes up 27.5% of the manufacturing industry's workforce, and why other women should take advantage of the opportunities available in this booming sector.

The manufacturing industry is vital to Australia’s economy and accounts for six per cent of our national Gross Domestic Product. Thales Australia is an important contributor to this sector, particularly through our Small Arms manufacture in Lithgow and Acoustic sensor manufacture at Rydalmere delivering advanced capability to support some of the State’s and Commonwealth’s strategically important programs to ‘build a future we can all trust.’

Latia got her first taste of the industry working as a production operator on afternoon shift at Lithgow Arms to help her pay for university. ""Working on-site, I started to sit with the CNC setters who took the time to show me what they did. I was fascinated by the process, and within six months, I had deferred uni and applied for an apprenticeship,"" says Latia. She completed a Certificate II in Engineering before starting a Certificate IV as part of her apprenticeship at Thales, which helped her gain a range of hands-on technical skills in welding and fitting, and machining.

I think a lot of women would surprise themselves about what they're capable of achieving in this industry. Every day is different, and the learning and promotion opportunities mean I can continue to progress in my career. If you have the motivation, the sky is the limit of what you could achieve."" Latia Hardie, Manufacturing Technician - Machine Setter at Thales Australia & NZ.

Latia has long been an advocate for the career opportunities available at Thales through an apprenticeship and previously appeared a guest speaker at Industry Careers Webinar hosted by the Regional Industry Education Partnerships program to educate secondary school students on the important work we do for the Australian Defence Force. She believes sharing her story is a useful way to reach young women weighing up their career options at a pivotal point in their life. ""I had no idea what I wanted to do when I left school, and girls were pushed towards university. A career in trade wasn't something I had the option to explore,"" says Latia.

Apprentices are an important part of the team culture at Thales Australia’s Lithgow Arms business and many of the site’s technical, engineering and middle management started their careers as apprentices. Thales Australia’s Lithgow based Business Improvement Manager David Forbes says:

We truly believe at Lithgow that we reap what we sow, and the time we invested in our apprentices will ensure that our sovereign capability into the future is secured. I’m confident our apprenticeship program will continue to breed and prepare young people for a new era of technologies, digitisation, artificial intelligence and customer focused systems.""

SWOT satellite making final launch preparations – SatNews - SatNews,"Wed, 07 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5zYXRuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIyLzA5LzA3L3N3b3Qtc2F0ZWxsaXRlLW1ha2luZy1maW5hbC1sYXVuY2gtcHJlcGFyYXRpb25zL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Photo of the SWOT satellite @ Thales Alenia Space. Photo is courtesy of the company.

After more than a year in assembly, integration and testing at Thales Alenia Space’s facility in Cannes, France, for the French and U.S. space agencies CNES and NASA, the SWOT satellite (Surface Water and Ocean Topography) is making final preparations for launch from the United States.

Artistic rendition of SWOT on-orbit.

SWOT is a joint mission of CNES and NASA, with contributions from the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and the United Kingdom Space Agency (UKSA). It is dedicated to measuring surface water levels in lakes and rivers and river discharges, and to acquiring highly precise and detailed data on ocean dynamics.

SWOT features a number of unprecedented technological innovations and is based on a major disruptive technology, namely the wide-swath KaRIn interferometer designed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). CNES and Thales Alenia Space built the radio-frequency assembly for this instrument. KaRIn has two, Ka-band, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) antennas separated by a 10-meter boom that will enable it to view a 120-kilometre swath with a horizontal resolution on the order of 50 to 100 meters, configurable on either side of the satellite’s ground track.0

SWOT will also be carrying a Nadir module comprising the same instruments as the Jason series of satellites, including the Poseidon dual-frequency altimeter built by Thales Alenia Space. This module will also carry the DORIS precise orbit determination system, built by Thales, an Advanced Microwave Radiometer (AMR), a GPS Payload (GPSP) and a Laser Retro-reflector Array (LRA) developed by JPL.

SWOT promises to revolutionize oceanography and land surface hydrology as the latest in a long line of missions accomplished in partnership by CNES, NASA and Thales Alenia Space, starting in 1992 with the launch of the TOPEX/Poseidon satellite and continued through the series of Jason satellite missions. SWOT will be the first satellite to be decommissioned at the end of its lifetime by making a controlled atmospheric re-entry, in compliance with the French Space Operations Act (FSOA) geared towards tackling space debris, which took effect in 2020.

Designed to study ocean topography and surface waters, SWOT has a two-pronged mission that covers oceanography and hydrology. The satellite will observe ocean circulation in 2D with a tenfold gain in resolution. This will help the analysis and understanding of the effects of coastal circulation on marine life, ecosystems, water quality and energy transfers, to improve modelling of atmosphere-ocean interactions. The hydrology part of the mission will assess variations in water levels in wetlands, lakes and reservoirs, as well as river discharges. SWOT is thus set to deliver key innovations in a sector where the strategic, economic and societal stakes have never been higher.

SWOT is now primed for a planned departure to the United States in early October, bringing to a close a year of effort on the part of French and U.S. teams at Thales Alenia Space. During the last 12 months, the science payload supplied by JPL has been integrated with the spacecraft bus developed by Thales Alenia Space for prime contractor CNES. After these assembly operations, the teams conducted a series of functional and environmental tests on the satellite and its instruments to verify their ability to withstand the harsh conditions of launch and space.

A U.S. Air Force C5-Galaxy freighter aircraft will be deployed specially to fly the two-ton satellite and its shipping container from Nice Airport to Vandenberg Space Force Base (VSFB) for a launch no earlier than December 5th atop a Falcon 9 vehicle operated by SpaceX.

Thierry Lafon, CNES’s SWOT project leader, said, “The completion of SWOT’s integration in France illustrates our nation’s desire through CNES and the PIA future investment programme, and that of its international and industry partners, to pave the way for new generations of observation systems built around disruptive technologies like interferometric radar altimetry. This pioneering mission will be the first to conduct a systematic global survey of Earth’s water, marking a giant leap towards managing this resource more efficiently. It holds out a lot of potential for our space industry as well as for future users of its data. The international scientific community is eagerly awaiting these new data to gain a closer insight into the global water cycle and enhance their understanding of the ocean’s role in climate change.”

“SWOT is an emblematic mission not only because it seeks to address international climate stakes, but also because it will serve what is one of our most critical shared resources, Water,” said Christophe Duplay, SWOT program manager at Thales Alenia Space. “The satellite will allow us for the first time to survey the entire water cycle from lakes and rivers to seas and oceans. For the teams at Thales Alenia Space, this programme is the continuation of its longstanding partnership with CNES and NASA in the field of satellite altimetry since the successful Jason missions that have enabled operational oceanography to be deployed worldwide.”

CNES is the government agency responsible for shaping France’s space policy and implementing it in Europe. Its task is to conceive and orbit satellites, invent the space systems of the future and nurture new services to aid us in our daily lives. Founded in 1961, it is the initiator of major space projects, launch vehicles and satellites, and the partner of choice for industry, supporting exports and fuelling innovation. CNES is working in infinite fields of applications in five core areas of focus: Ariane, science, Earth observation, telecommunications and defence. CNES is a key player driving technology research, economic development and industrial policy for the nation. It also fosters scientific collaborations and has forged numerous international partnerships. France, represented by CNES, is the leading contributor to the European Space Agency (ESA), which conducts Europe’s space policy on behalf of its 22 member states."

Credit: SMRT Corporation Ltd.

SMRT Trains has collaborated with France-based Thales to develop next-generation rail signalling technologies for greener rides in Singapore.

Both entities will work on an initiative called “The Next-Generation Green CBTC Project,” which is expected to help SMRT Trains to attain net zero emissions by 2050.

The project mainly focuses on lowering electricity consumption besides further improving the traction energy efficiency of the North-South and East-West lines (NSEWL).

In 2017, Thales’ SelTrac communications-based train control (CBTC) system was first deployed on NSEWL.

Given that NSEWL is managed by CBTC signalling, the traction-related actions of acceleration, braking, and coasting are controlled by the automatic train operation (ATO) system.

Serving as an environmentally sustainable alternative, Singapore’s Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) systems operate on inherently green traction power.

Thales’ automatic train control (ATC) system combines smart and green CBTC algorithms.

These algorithms help to operate an automated and driverless train, which follows optimised curves to cut down energy and boost punctuality.

Now, both the entities will focus on further developing the next-generation Green CBTC algorithms to assess the operational efficiency of its green features leveraging data analytics.

The partnership will also study the potential uses of the new intelligent application to cut down the traction energy of the NSEW lines by 15%.

SMRT Trains president Lam Sheau Kai said: “This joint development of the Next-Generation Green CBTC system on NSEWL is a project that shows SMRT’s commitment to long-term sustainability and net-zero emissions.

“We are glad to partner Thales to enable energy-optimised train operations. In view of rising electricity costs, any reduction of energy usage in our operations will contribute to greater productivity and financial sustainability.”

In July this year, Thales won a long-term services (LTSS) contract from SMRT Trains."

Long journey to the skies | EUMETSAT - EUMETSAT,"Thu, 29 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1bWV0c2F0LmludC9sb25nLWpvdXJuZXktc2tpZXPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"When the power was temporarily switched off on EUMETSAT’s Meteosat Third Generation first imager satellite (MTG-I1) in Cannes, France on 14 September, Pierre Armand, MTG Programme Director at Thales Alenia Space allowed himself to breathe a short sigh of relief.

The moment signalled MTG-I1 was now ready to embark on the final stages of the spacecraft’s much-anticipated journey to a geostationary orbit, some 36,000 kilometres above the Earth’s surface. Once in position, the satellite will provide data essential for weather services such as ‘nowcasting’ – very short range forecasts of fast-evolving weather like thunderstorms.

But before MTG-I1 takes to the skies, Armand — and thousands of meteorologists, engineers, remote sensing scientists, training officers, and others who have helped turn the mission from blueprint to reality — will have to bear a few more heart-in-the-mouth moments.

This begins now, with MTG-I1 embarking on a two-week voyage by ship from southern France to the satellite’s launch site on the other side of the Atlantic, in Kourou, French Guiana.

“For the past two years, our teams in Cannes have been working double and triple shifts — and very often during the weekends — to get everything ready on time,” says Armand, who leads a team of more than 300 experts at Thales Alenia Space, a space manufacturer that is responsible for building the MTG-I satellites and Flexible Combined Imager payloads as part of the MTG programme.

The company, together with OHB as major partner, is the main contractor on the MTG programme that will ultimately include four imager and two sounder satellites.

“We are now ready to move to next stages and it’s very exciting to see the last crucial steps being taken to get MTG-I1 safely to the launch pad, where the Ariane-5 rocket will propel the satellite into orbit.”

Rising to shipment challenges

In its container, MTG-I1 is the size of a small bus, weighing around 20 tonnes (the satellite alone weighs roughly 2000 kilogrammes). As an oversize load, the satellite necessitated a police escort to chaperone a convoy carrying it from Cannes to the port at Fos-sur-Mer, near Marseille, some 300 kilometres away.

“Thankfully we now have a lot of experience transporting satellites by boat,” Armand says. “I am very confident MTG-I1 will arrive safe and sound at its destination on time for the next stages of the mission.”

To prepare MTG-I1 for the voyage, the spacecraft has been carefully packed into a shipping container that also serves as a cleanroom to minimise risks of the satellite coming into contact with contaminants that might damage delicate instruments.

Specialists have also spent several days loading seven freight containers’ worth of hardware, maintenance and backup equipment, triple checking every item that might be needed for MTG-I1 to take to the skies.

“One of the biggest challenges is making sure that we take everything we need — from computer wires to backup generators,” Armand says. “If even one small item is missing, it could set us back days.

“If a larger item that cannot be couriered by a commercial plane is damaged or missing, then it could become very complicated and even result in a delay to the launch despite how creative we usually are to put in place a solution. Some items are mission-critical, others packed ‘just in case’. But every component will play a vital role in ensuring that MTG-I1 has a successful launch.”

Expecting the unexpected

The MTG team is ready for almost every possible eventuality, with experts keeping a watchful eye on the conditions of the precious cargo during its long voyage.

“Although the satellite will be very securely packed, it's crucial to ensure that humidity, pressure, and temperature are maintained at ambient levels,” Armand says. “For example, just a few days without air conditioning could cause big problems for the satellite’s instruments.

“We have also built in a few days of buffer time should the ship have to change course because of storms or other difficult weather conditions.

“On the other hand, we have designed the satellite to withstand a rocket launch, so in many respects it is very robust. Although the launch will only last a few minutes, the levels of stress on equipment during this time will be far beyond what we expect at sea.”

Nevertheless, when MTG-I1 reaches the harbour of Kourou in mid-October, Armand says he will breathe another short sigh of relief. But there will be more exhilarating moments ahead.

“Having the satellite ready for the voyage to Kourou is already an amazing achievement,” says Armand. “But there are still some key tests to come and several months of intense activity before MTG-I1 is ready for launch.

“Once the satellite is in French Guiana, we will repeat rigorous tests that we have already carried out in Cannes to verify the satellite is still in good shape.

“Then, we have to prepare for the transfer to the rocket. This will include a critical phase when we load propellants. Rocket fuel is of course highly flammable and guaranteeing the safety of people and equipment is paramount.”

Once the satellite is transferred on top of the Ariane 5 rocket and to the launch pad, Armand’s team will then oversee the final checks and wait patiently for the green light that will signal ‘all systems go!’.

“The launch will be a very nerve-wracking time. MTG-I1 will embark on one of the most critical parts of the mission: its launch and early orbit phase,” he explains. “Once separated from the launch vehicle, engineers will take control of the satellite, activate its subsystems, guide its orbit and orientation, and undertake an array of other critical manoeuvres.”

Two weeks later, MTG-I1’s instruments will be switched on and a long period of verification will begin.

Looking forward to launch

But before that, if all goes to plan with the satellite’s launch into space, a big celebration will be in store.

“When the satellite is launched it will be a huge event,” Armand says. “We need to make sure that we are completely ready so that there are no red flags, that the satellite passes all of its critical stress tests, and the only thing that we need to worry about is the weather.

“MTG is a massive programme that has pushed the boundaries of what is technically achievable. This has only been possible thanks to tremendous collaboration between all parties involved, including EUMETSAT, the European Space Agency, Thales Alania Space, OHB, and many other organisations.

“I have personally been working on MTG for more than a decade now, and it’s been a tremendous journey so far. With the operation of the satellite and follow-up missions such as a second imager satellite, a sounder satellite, and their replacements, the programme still has a long way to go.

“But I am looking forward to the time when MTG-I1 is fully operational, the pressure is down a little bit, and we can begin to enjoy the impact that this fantastic programme will have on monitoring weather, climate and environment from space.

“We are very excited about the impact MTG will have on weather forecasts in the coming decades, thanks to the quality and accuracy of the datasets that will be downloaded from the spacecraft to be used by meteorological experts.

“MTG is going to help save lives while paving the way for new kinds of services for Europe’s and Africa’s citizens.”

Arianespace’s third launch of 2022, with the second Ariane 5 of the year, will be sending a geostationary satellite: EUTELSAT KONNECT VHTS — to orbit.

The launch will be performed in Kourou, French Guiana, on September 6th. The launcher will be carrying a total payload of approximately 6.4 tons.

With an instantaneous rate of 500 Gbps, the EUTELSAT KONNECT VHTS will provide high-speed internet access throughout Europe, in particular for isolated regions with low coverage, offering a service comparable to fiber optic networks in terms of performance and cost, thus making a significant contribution to bridging the digital divide.

EUTELSAT KONNECT VHTS will also address the broadband connectivity needs of fixed and mobile telecommunications networks, on land, sea or in the air.

EUTELSAT KONNECT VHTS was built in France by Thales Alenia Space around the Spacebus NEO all-electric propulsion platform (artistic rendition below). It carries a cutting-edge payload using disruptive technologies developed with the support of the French Government, via the Centre National d’Etudes Spatiales (CNES) and the “Investing in the Future” program (PIA), together with the European Space Agency (ESA). The payload notably comprises the most powerful digital processor in the world that combines agile capacity allocation, optimized spectrum use and support, and gradual deployment of network coverage on the ground.

KONNECT VHTS will be the 37 th Eutelsat satellite launched by Arianespace

Eutelsat satellite launched by Arianespace It will be the 166th Thales Alenia Space satellite to be launched by Arianespace.

It is reported by Railway Supply magazine with reference to Railway Technology.

The project is mainly aimed at reducing electricity consumption, as well as further improving the energy efficiency of traction on NSEWL lines. In 2017, Thales’ SelTrac Communications Based Train Control (CBTC) system was deployed for the first time on NSEWL.

Given that the NSEWL is controlled by the CBTC signalling, the traction-related actions of acceleration, braking and coasting are controlled by the automatic train operation (ATO) system. As a sustainable alternative, Singapore’s Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) systems run on clean traction energy.

The Thales Automatic Train Control (ATC) system combines intelligent and environmentally friendly CBTC algorithms. These algorithms help drive an automated driverless train that follows optimized curves to reduce energy consumption and increase punctuality.

Changsha – Yiyang High-Speed ​​Line Opened

Both organizations will now focus on further developing next-generation Green CBTC algorithms to evaluate the operational performance of their green functions using data analytics. The partnership will also explore the potential of using a new smart application to reduce the traction energy of NSEWL lines by 15%.

SMRT Trains President Lam Sheau Kai said, “This joint development of the next generation Green CBTC system at NSEWL is a project that demonstrates SMRT’s commitment to long-term sustainability and zero emissions.

“We are delighted to be partnering with Thales to provide energy-optimized trains. With the cost of electricity rising, any reduction in energy consumption across our operations will help improve productivity and financial sustainability.”

In July of this year, Thales won a long-term service contract with SMRT Trains.

"ESA completes end-to-end test of enhanced, secure Galileo service - GPS World magazine","Wed, 14 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdwc3dvcmxkLmNvbS9lc2EtY29tcGxldGVzLWVuZC10by1lbmQtdGVzdC1vZi1lbmhhbmNlZC1zZWN1cmUtZ2FsaWxlby1zZXJ2aWNlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"News from the European Space Agency (ESA)

Europe’s Galileo satellite navigation system continues to evolve. For the first time, end-to-end testing of the Galileo system demonstrated signal acquisition of an improved version of the Public Regulated Service (PRS), the most secure and robust class of Galileo services.

The system test extended from the Galileo Security Monitoring Centre in Spain and the Galileo Control Centre in Germany to a Galileo satellite at ESA’s ESTEC technical heart in the Netherlands, which then broadcast in turn to a user receiver.

Galileo’s PRS is an encrypted navigation and timing service for governmental authorized users and sensitive applications intended to remain available even in scenarios where other Galileo services might be degraded or jammed.

An initial version of the PRS signal has been broadcast by the satellites up to now, but as of next year the signals will evolve into an enhanced version known as Full Operational Capability Public Regulated Service (FOC PRS), which has been defined in close collaboration with the European Commission, the European Union Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA) and the EU Member States.

The system’s FOC PRS capability is being enabled by an expansion of the Galileo ground mission segment — important upgrades of the Galileo Security Monitoring Centres (GSMCs) in St. Germain-en-Laye, France, and Madrid, Spain. These two sites oversee PRS provision and monitor its performance.

This coming version of the security monitoring centers, set for the following year, is being developed by an industrial consortium led by Thales Alenia Space in France.

Meanwhile the progressive deployment of remote system infrastructure is taking place over the course of this year, readying Galileo sensor stations to receive the upgraded PRS signals.

“To qualify, the FOC PRS Signal in Space required a major Galileo end-to-end test, demonstrating the compatibility of the space segment with the ground and user segments, called the System Compatibility Test Campaign (SCTC),” explained Federico Di Marco, ESA SCTC test director. “This test involved all Galileo key players spread across Europe, requiring close cooperation between the teams and months of preparation.”

The SCTC was led by an ESA engineering team from the agency’s ESTEC technical center in Noordwijk, the Netherlands supported by the System Engineering Technical Assistance industrial team led by Thales Alenia Space in Italy and in close collaboration with the operations team supervised by EUSPA.

“The testing involved three centers across Europe: the GSMC in Madrid, the Galileo Control Centre in Oberpfaffenhofen, and ESTEC hosting an actual Galileo satellite plus FOC PRS user receivers,” added Edward Breeuwer, who is in charge of Galileo system qualification at ESA.

The FOC PRS signal was generated at the GSMC, sent to the German control center, then uplinked to the Galileo satellite at ESTEC, where the satellites are tested for space in advance of launch. The Galileo satellite then broadcast the FOC PRS signal in turn, to be picked up by a pair of receivers also on site: one developed by Antwerp Space under ESA contract and the other developed by Leonardo as part of a national development undertaken by Italy’s Competent PRS Authority, charged with overseeing the country’s PRS use.

“This marks the first time we have integrated such a nationally developed receiver within a system test activity,” said Fabio Covello, who oversees system security for ESA. “Having achieved this for PRS makes us very proud. We are confident that this experience can pave the way for future fruitful collaborations between the Galileo Programme and EU Member States, in the frame of specific tests to guarantee compatibility between the ESA-developed system and nationally developed PRS receivers.”

This successful outcome sets the scene for the PRS qualification at ground segment and system level, followed by operational validation planned in coming months, culminating in the first FOC PRS Signal In Space operational broadcast, in the course of next year."

Arabsat’s new 7A software-defined satellite to be deployed in 2023 - SatelliteProME.com,"Mon, 19 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vc2F0ZWxsaXRlcHJvbWUuY29tL25ld3Mvb3BlcmF0b3JzL3NhdGVsbGl0ZS9hcmFic2F0cy1uZXctN2Etc29mdHdhcmUtZGVmaW5lZC1zYXRlbGxpdGUtdG8tYmUtZGVwbG95ZWQtaW4tMjAyMy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Based on Thales Alenia Space’s Inspire platform, the 7A will ensure more efficient use of spectrum and empower Arabsat to offer more flexible solutions to clients.

Earlier this year, MENA satellite operator, Arabsat, signed a contract with Thales Alenia Space to build Arabsat7A, a fully flexible Software-Defined Satellite (SDS) based on the Space Inspire (INstant SPace In-orbit REconfiguration) platform by Thales Alenia Space.

The contract places Arabsat in a special league with those geostationary satellite operators that have chosen this technology to transition from traditional bentpipe GEO satellites to the highly agile and adaptable SDSs, which are expected to change the face of the geostationary satcom industry. The Space Inspire platform will enable seamless telecom mission and services reconfiguration of the Arabsat-7A satellite, instant in-orbit adjustment to broadband connectivity demand, and superior video broadcasting performance while maximising the effective use of satellite resources.

Arabsat 7A will join 6A and 5A at its data hotspot at 30.5E. It will replace the bulk of the existing C and Ku-band capacity on Arabsat 5A as this satellite reaches end-of-life to ensure a seamless transition for customers and partners. It will also offer ample high-throughput Ku-band capacity to help the operator expand its services into several verticals to enhance its portfolio of products and solutions over the Middle East, Africa and beyond, to parts of Europe.

“Following a lengthy and rigorous evaluation of the various products currently available on the market, Arabsat decided to go with the Space Inspire platform and entrust Thales Alenia Space, whom we have partnered with for well over four decades on several programmes,” commented Dr. Badr N. Alsuwaidan, CTO of Arabsat.

“This programme is fully aligned with Arabsat’s new transformation strategy, which is aimed at bringing Arabsat closer to its loyal customers to ensure sustainable growth for the satcom business in the region as well as partnering with governments and enterprises in various countries to bridge the digital divide and connect the unconnected which has become synonymous with economic prosperity and people empowerment.”

Elaborating further, Alsuwaidan said: “With our beams, we can adjust to our customers’ needs and tailor our service to their requirements based on where they are and the specific needs they have. On this basis, we can provide more capacity to certain customers in some geographical locations. We can be more flexible and customer oriented. In addition, customer demands change over time, which means there may be times when they require more capacity and other times, when they require less.”

With the MENA region undergoing dramatic changes and many areas undergoing rapid development, the need for telecom services is at its peak.

“In Saudi Arabia, places like Neom and some cities in the GCC are experiencing massive growth. Neom, for instance, is seeing accelerated development and requires a lot of services that by default need higher capacity. We are looking to address the requirements in these areas and are working with our partners and service providers to provide more managed service to our customers, alongside traditional services,” he added.

Arabsat 7A is expected to replace the bulk of the existing C and Ku-band capacity on Arabsat 5A as this satellite reaches the end of its life. 7A will offer ample high-throughput Ku-band capacity to help Arabsat expand its services into several verticals to enhance its portfolio of products and solutions over the Middle East, Africa and beyond, to parts of Europe.

“This satellite ensures more efficient use of spectrum, which is what the ITU regulation stipulates and towards which all of us are working. With it, coverage of the MENA region will include a lot of growing cities and developing areas in Africa, where there is a lot of need for telecommunication services.

One of the reasons why satellites are a better option in rural areas is because terrestrial services require a larger population to justify the cost of infrastructural deployment and time taken to implement.

“Satellite is a more efficient solution, and we serve several different verticals like hospitals, enterprises, oil and gas, industrial areas and so on,” explains Alsuwaidan.

Wael Butti, VP, Chief Commercial Officer, Arabsat added: “This new technology will help us to develop several new products but also offer a lot of flexibility to the market. We now know what our clients are looking for something like the 7A, which will play a big role in telecommunications.”

Arabsat is also looking to implement a service for 5G backhauling, Butti confided. “This will help the GSM operators here cover the whole country for 5G,” he stated, adding that the satellite operator works with GSM operators, VSA specialists and others to ensure that between them, the companies are able to complement each other’s services and offer people complete country coverage."
Indian Army Seeking CQB Carbine - Asian Military Review,"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzaWFubWlsaXRhcnlyZXZpZXcuY29tLzIwMjIvMDkvaW5kaWFuLWFybXktc2Vla2luZy1jcWItY2FyYmluZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Indian Army reissued on 23 September 2022 a request for information (RFI) to identify candidates for Close Quarters Battle (CQB) carbines to be procured from domestic Indian industry.

This procurement program could be considered a restart of 2010 and 2018 efforts which also sought a replacement for the current Sterling 1A1/2 9mm Carbine that has been in service since prior to 1945. Both of the prior programs, including following a three-year evaluation period in the former, were cancelled. In the later the UAE Caracal International CAR816 and Thales Australia F60 were shortlisted but it too was ended.

The new RFI calls out a 5.56 x45mm calibre weapon which must have a weight of no more than 3 kg (without magazine) and length of 800 mm or less. It will have a Picatinny accessory rail and use a 30-round magazine. The carbine is intended for primary use against targets up to 200 meters with accuracy to place 90 percent of shots in a 150 X 150 mm group at 100 meters. Firing 2 to round bursts 60 percent of impacts will be within a 240 X 240 mm group. In addition, the weapon must operate at minus 10 to plus 45 degrees C.

The deadline for RFI responses is October 21 with a Request for Proposal

(RfP) to selected vendors anticipated in November 2022. The RFI calls out a potential requirement for 425,213 weapons, though the last prior tender had sought 93,895. The selected industry must be able to provide production weapons within eight months of award. Even with the selection off the RfP in following the Defense Acquisition Procedure 2020 the process to a production contact award could require 24-36 months. In this case new CQB Carbines could reach the field in 2027.

Potential anticipated candidates may include the Caracal CAR816, Kalyani Gp with Thales’ EF88 Austeyer, PLR with Galil ACE, OFB using its own design, SSS Defense’s M72, Jindal Group offering the Brazilian Taurus and Neco Desert Tech an Indian/United States industry joint venture. It might also be possible for more designs to be presented if the offeror commits to establishing a manufacturing base in India. In any case the Army end-users are anxious to see the CQB Carbine move forward.

Meltem Özgenç - ANTALYA

A new mud snail species has been found in the southern province of Antalya and has been named after Thales, a philosopher from the ancient Greek city of Miletus, modern-day Türkiye’s Aydın, the Agriculture and Forestry Ministry has announced.

Amid the efforts to take an inventory of all aquatic ecosystems, especially fish, in rivers, lakes, and coastal and transitional waters in 25 basins across Türkiye, 5,300 species were recorded, more than 600 of which were seen for the first time in Türkiye.

A new mud snail species was also found between the borders of the Aegean province of Muğla and the southern province of Antalya.

The mud snail was named after Thales, one of history’s important scientific and philosophical figures, as he lived in the Miletus region, an ancient city whose ruins are located near the Aegean province of Aydın.

Deniz Anıl Odabaşı, a professor from Çanakkale Onsekiz Mart University who is involved in the project and named the snail, stated the discovery of this species in the region was “the proof of the water’s quality.”

The project is planned to be completed by the end of 2028.

Meanwhile, within the scope of the project launched in a bid to monitor water quality, over 850 clean water sources were identified, including 510 rivers, 184 lakes and 85 transitional and 74 coastal water bodies.

The mud snails have rounded shells with a high spire, an oval aperture and a siphonal notch.

This family of snails is found worldwide, and while they mostly live in shallow water, on sandy or muddy substrates, often intertidally, they are also sometimes found in deep water.

They can be present in very large numbers in suitable habitats as they are primarily active and lively scavengers."
"ProvidusBank, Mastercard, Interswitch and Thales launch contactless Tap-to-Pay transactions via smart devices in ... - Guardian Nigeria","Thu, 29 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL2d1YXJkaWFuLm5nL2ZlYXR1cmVzL3Byb3ZpZHVzYmFuay1tYXN0ZXJjYXJkLWludGVyc3dpdGNoLWFuZC10aGFsZXMtbGF1bmNoLWNvbnRhY3RsZXNzLXRhcC10by1wYXktdHJhbnNhY3Rpb25zLXZpYS1zbWFydC1kZXZpY2VzLWluLW5pZ2VyaWEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In a move to further reduce dependency on cash transactions, stimulate innovation and drive the growth of digital payments in Nigeria, ProvidusBank together with Mastercard, Interswitch and Thales Group, today announced the introduction of a new Tap-to-Pay service. The service allows cardholders to make fast, secure, and convenient in-store payments by tapping their NFC-enabled smart device at any contactless-enabled payment terminal.

The solution works by enabling a connected device such as a smartphone or wearable device to act as a safe and secure payment method in the same way as a physical card.

Leveraging Mastercard’s Digital Enablement Service (MDES), and Interswitch’s tokenization capability, ProvidusBank customers can enjoy a new level of convenience, no longer needing a card or a physical wallet during shopping trips.

For each transaction, Mastercard’s tokenization and digitization technology replace primary account numbers (PANs) with tokens to provide a faster, more secure, and seamless checkout experience while rendering card numbers useless to fraudsters.

“Technology has evolved greatly in Sub-Saharan Africa in the last decade with mobile phone technology playing a significant role in that space. As a Bank, our collaboration with Mastercard and Interswitch to provide additional value through the mobile device is a strategy to leverage existing infrastructure, while delivering simplified payment through their advanced digital and tokenisation services,” said Walter Akpani, Managing Director/CEO, ProvidusBank.

All Mastercard transactions are made with industry-standard EMV-level security and are protected using standards-based payment tokens.

“The convergence of physical and digital commerce is not in the future, it’s happening now. At Mastercard, we understand that consumers want to make digital payments when, where and how they want, with the same protection and security offered with a physical card,” says Ebehijie Momoh, Country Manager & Area Business Head, West Africa at Mastercard. “As a pioneer of mobile commerce innovation, we are excited to work with ProvidusBank to deliver a new payment experience that is both seamless and secure, in turn speeding the adoption of digital payments in Nigeria.”

Akeem Lawal, Managing Director, Interswitch Purepay also commented on the collaboration. According to him: “With the increasing adoption of digital payments, there has been the corresponding need for players in the payments ecosystem to heighten the safety and security of payment platforms and channels. This notion is the underpinning rationale behind Interswitch’s collaboration with Providus Bank, Thales Group and Mastercard to deliver the tokenization technology, providing an added security layer and ensuring safer and more seamless payment transactions. At Interswitch, we continue to leverage key partnerships that push the boundaries of innovation.”

To use the service, customers need to first digitize their card as a once-off set-up by following instructions in their banking app. Once the card credentials are provisioned to a mobile device, a cardholder can tap to pay simply by opening their banking app, selecting NFC payments, tapping their phone at the Point of Sale and entering their PIN to complete the transaction. They can also make safe and seamless in-app and e-commerce payments.

Speaking in the same vein, Nassir Ghrous, VP of Sales Banking and Payments Services at Thales Group, a global leader in advanced technologies said: “We are excited to bring our digital security expertise to bear in developing the tokenization solution with innovators such as Interswitch, Providus Bank and Mastercard, to enhance the payment ecosystem in Nigeria. With EMV tokenization, the consumer’s actual 16-digit card number is protected from being exposed online during the transaction. The solution also allows Providus cardholders to benefit from contactless payment via their mobile devices, enjoying a full, easy and convenient ‘Digital Journey.”"
IoT M&A and product exits consolidate a fragmented market - Verdict,"Fri, 02 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZlcmRpY3QuY28udWsvaW90LW1lcmdlcnMtYWNxdWlzaXRpb25zLWV4aXRzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The last two months has seen an unusual level of M&A activity within the IoT ecosystem, as well as the announced exit of an IoT platform from a major vendor. These changes confirm a need for consolidation in what has been often described as an overly complex and fragmented market, and hopefully provide a path to growth and longevity for vendors by enlarging their product scope. Alternately it could be construed as a sign of weakness in the IoT market.

Mergers and Acquisitions

On July 29th, Telit, (a US based provider of IoT technology solutions including hardware and management platforms) announced its intention to acquire the cellular IoT products of Thales (a French vendor of aerospace, defense, security and digital identity solutions). These include Thales’ portfolio of wireless communication modules, gateways, and data modem cards, supporting 4G LTE, LPWAN and 5G. Telit notes that the acquisition will expand its presence in new industrial IoT segments including payment systems, energy, e-health, and security. It also enhances the company’s ability to respond to demand for cybersecure IoT solutions in modules and cellular connectivity. In turn, Thales will take a 25 percent stake in the expanded Telit business, which will be rebranded as Telit Cinterion. The name originates from the Thales line of cellular IoT modules which took their name from German IoT specialist Cinterion, following Cinterion’s purchase by Gemalto in 2019; Gemalto was subsequently acquired by Thales in 2019.

On August 29th, Telit announced the acquisition of Mobilogix, a startup specializing in custom IoT solutions, to draw customers that are focused on reduced complexity and quicker time to market. Mobilogix adds device engineering expertise and resources that optimize specifications for handoff to electronic manufacturing services and OEMs and help shorten time for regulatory approvals and carrier certifications. It also specializes in verticals including telematics, micro-mobility, healthcare, construction, and agriculture.

On August 2nd, U.S. LoRa specialist and semiconductor manufacturer Semtech confirmed its $1.3 billion acquisition of Canadian vendor Sierra Wireless (a provider of cellular modules and gateways as well as cloud and MVNO services and platforms). Semtech states that the move “significantly” expands its addressable market and will double annual revenue, generating $40M in run-rate operational synergies within 12-18 months of the deal’s closing. Semtech CEO also noted that the acquisition is a “critical part of bringing the vision of the “Internet of Everything” to life through the combination of the two vendors’ cellular, LoRa and Cloud services.

IoT Market exit

On August 17th, Google announced the shut-down of its IoT Core platform (with a one-year lead time for customers to change providers) and a shift to relying on application and service partners to handle customers’ IoT application enablement requirements. Google’s platform was similar to those of hyperscaler rivals Microsoft and AWS, as it helped businesses and developers manage IoT devices, as well as ingest the data, use analytics to understand what the data means, and leverage it to make key business decisions.

While AWS and Microsoft have had a historical lead over Google in cloud services in general, and in enterprise focused IoT platforms in particular, Google appeared to be gaining more traction in IoT lately with some key enhancements such as a partnership with Litmus to incorporate industrial edge computing platform into its smart factory solutions; and a new Supply Chain Twin offering, which allows businesses to model supply chain activities. Google’s departure from the market makes one wonder about the health and growth of IoT platforms and services among all the hyperscalers, who had initially assumed IoT would boost their cloud service customers and revenues.

IoT ecosystem de-fragmentation through mergers and acquisitions seems like a positive trend for an over-complicated market in which customers still complain that they need to buy and manage separate elements from disparate vendors and may have trouble proving adequate ROI to key stakeholders. However, IoT connection growth rates were lower than expected in 2021, at 8%, (for a total of about 12 billion global connections), but lower growth has been widely attributed to the chip supply shortage and Covid concerns rather than dampening of demand."

Trade union Unite said it's members voted in an industrial ballot with a 77.5% majority in pursuit of improved pay.

The union called an management to meet in full its members’ pay claim for an ‘inflation-plus-one-percent’ increase of 8.1% based on the then-retail price index, submitted in January, for the year.

A spokesperson for the union said management have so far offered a 5% pay increase plus a non-consolidated one-off payment of £500.

The site employs a workforce of 600.

General secretary of Unite, Sharon Graham, challenged Thales to respond to the pay expectations of its Belfast workforce.

She said: “The success of Thales in Northern Ireland has been trumpeted widely by the Tory government – indeed it was recently visited by a government minister.

“Workers at Thales deserve better. This is a hugely successful business which can afford to pay out a proper pay increase meeting our members’ pay claim in full. Workers at Thales can count on the full support of Unite in securing that outcome.”

Unite Regional Coordinating Officer Susan Fitzgerald is lead official for the workforce at Thales. She said: “Thales turns considerably more than a billion in profits every year and those profits are set to increase even further.

""Last year, the company raised dividends by 45 percent but workers are being offered a mere 5 percent instead of the 8.1 percent pay claim they submitted at the beginning of this year.

""Our members have provided this union with a powerful mandate for strike action; in the absence of any movement from the employer workers will be left with no alternative but to take their dispute to the picket line.”

In a statement, a company spokesperson said: “Thales recognises trades unions and values the role they play.

""We have been engaging with our Belfast site and regional representatives for Unite the Union since the start of 2022 around pay but, unfortunately, despite a number of offers and discussions, we have been unable to reach an agreement.

“Following a ballot, Unite members at the site have voted to take industrial action. We are waiting to be formally told what form this will take and when.

“Thales will continue to engage with Union representatives in good faith to look to resolve this as quickly as possible.”"

The agreements were signed with SNCF International — France's state-owned railway company, French rail company Alstom, Progress Rail — which provides railroad and transit products and services, and Thales Group — which specialises in advanced technologies, Etihad Rail said on Friday.

“Our partners play a key role in supporting us to achieve our mission of developing and operating a rail network that incorporates state-of-the-art technologies, and provides safe, sustainable and reliable solutions,” said Ahmed Al Musawa, executive director of the passenger sector at Etihad Rail.

“Through partnering with some of the biggest names in the rail, cargo and transportation industry, we assure our clients that we are developing the UAE National Rail Network as per the highest international standards, to meet their requirements and support them in meeting their business objectives, driving a sustainable, resilient and cost-effective supply chain.""

Sustainability will be a key part of Etihad Rail's collaboration with Alstom, as they work on transitioning to zero-emission solutions, while the collaboration with Thales is focused on the digitalisation of services.

With Progress Rail, discussions will focus on ""potential opportunities for the development and deployment of an autonomous, zero-emissions port-to-port concept, which could serve as the foundation for future rail operations globally"", Etihad Rail said.

Watch: First Etihad Rail passenger station to be built in Fujairah

The Etihad Rail line will span approximately 1,200km. It will link 11 cities and areas across the UAE, from the border with Saudi Arabia to Fujairah in the north.

Etihad Rail's new high-tech trains were unveiled last month with the diesel-and-electricity-operated locomotives providing 4,600-brake horsepower.

They are also equipped with the latest filtering innovations such as the pulse sand filtering system, which ensures that the train operates at high effectiveness and efficiency when passing through desert regions.

They feature on-board technologies and systems such as the European Train Control System (ETCS) Level 2, a highly advanced signalling system, to bolster safety, reliability and efficiency.

Work on the project has progressed quickly this year, with more than 70 per of the line constructed as of last month.

No start date for the passenger service has been made public, but officials have said more than 36 million people will use the service annually by 2030.

The first passenger station will be built in Fujairah, and the trains will travel at speeds up to 200 kilometres an hour with the capacity to carry about 400 people.

Travelling from Abu Dhabi to Dubai, and from Dubai to Fujairah, will take 50 minutes, while Abu Dhabi to Al Ruwais will take 70 minutes, and Abu Dhabi to Fujairah 100 minutes."
"ProvidusBank, Mastercard, Interswitch and Thales Launch Contactless Tap-to-Pay Transactions in Nigeria - Tech ... - TechEconomy.ng","Wed, 07 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaGVjb25vbXkubmcvcHJvdmlkdXNiYW5rLW1hc3RlcmNhcmQtaW50ZXJzd2l0Y2gtYW5kLXRoYWxlcy1sYXVuY2gtY29udGFjdGxlc3MtdGFwLXRvLXBheS10cmFuc2FjdGlvbnMtaW4tbmlnZXJpYS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In a move to further reduce dependency on cash transactions, stimulate innovation and drive the growth of digital payments in Nigeria, ProvidusBank together with Mastercard, Interswitch and Thales Group, today announced the introduction of a new Tap-to-Pay service.

The service allows cardholders to make fast, secure, and convenient in-store payments by tapping their NFC enabled smart device at any contactless-enabled payment terminal.

The solution works by enabling a connected device such as a smartphone or wearable device to act as a safe and secure payment method in the same way as a physical card.

Leveraging Mastercard’s Digital Enablement Service (MDES), and Interswitch’s tokenization capability, ProvidusBank customers can enjoy a new level of convenience, no longer needing a card or a physical wallet during shopping trips.

For each transaction, Mastercard’s tokenization and digitization technology replaces primary account numbers (PANs) with tokens to provide a faster, more secure, and seamless checkout experience while rendering card numbers useless to fraudsters.

“Technology has evolved greatly in Sub-Saharan Africa in the last decade with the mobile phone technology playing a significant role in that space.

As a Bank, our collaboration with Mastercard and Interswitch to provide additional value through the mobile device is a strategy to leverage existing infrastructure, while delivering simplified payment through their advanced digital and tokenisation services,” said Walter Akpani, Managing Director/CEO, ProvidusBank.

All Mastercard transactions are made with industry-standard EMV-level security and are protected using standards-based payment tokens.

“The convergence of physical and digital commerce is not in the future, it’s happening now. At Mastercard, we understand that consumers want to make digital payments when, where and how they want, with the same protection and security offered with a physical card,” says Ebehijie Momoh, Country Manager & Area Business Head, West Africa at Mastercard.

“As a pioneer of mobile commerce innovation, we are excited to work with ProvidusBank to deliver a new payment experience that is both seamless and secure, in turn speeding the adoption of digital payments in Nigeria.”

Akeem Lawal, Managing Director, Interswitch Purepay also commented on the collaboration. According to him: “With the increasing adoption of digital payments, there has been the corresponding need for players in the payments ecosystem to heighten the safety and security of payment platforms and channels.

This notion is the underpinning rationale behind Interswitch’s collaboration with Providus Bank, Thales Group and Mastercard to deliver the tokenization technology, providing an added security layer and ensuring safer and more seamless payment transactions. At Interswitch, we continue to leverage key partnerships that push the boundaries of innovation.”

To use the service, customers need to first digitize their card as a once off set-up by following instructions in their banking app. Once the card credentials are provisioned to a mobile device, a cardholder can tap to pay simply by opening their banking app, selecting NFC payments, tapping their phone at the Point of Sale and entering their PIN to complete the transaction. They can also make safe and seamless in-app and e-commerce payments.

The service allows cardholders to make fast, secure, and convenient in-store payments by tapping their NFC enabled smart device at any contactless-enabled payment terminal.

Speaking in the same vein, Nassir Ghrous, VP Sales Banking and Payments Services at Thales Group, a global leader in advanced technologies said: “We are excited to bring our digital security expertise to bear in developing the tokenization solution with innovators such as Interswitch, Providus Bank and Mastercard, to enhance the payment ecosystem in Nigeria.

With EMV tokenization, the consumer’s actual 16-digit card number is protected from being exposed online during the transaction. The solution also allows Providus cardholders to benefit from contactless payment via their mobile devices, enjoying a full, easy and convenient ‘Digital Journey’.”

Friday Night Lights: Thales LUCIE - French GIGN LPNVG - - The Firearm Blog,"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZpcmVhcm1ibG9nLmNvbS9ibG9nLzIwMjIvMDkvMTYvZnJpZGF5LW5pZ2h0LWxpZ2h0cy10aGFsZXMtbHVjaWUtZnJlbmNoLWdpZ24tbHBudmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Hello there fellow night vision enthusiast. If you have been following along, last week I showcased the monocular pod adapters for the AB Night Vision RPNVG. If you have been following me, you might know that I have been lusting for a Thales LUCIE for some time now. Well, I have one now and am happy to share this interesting low-profile night vision goggle (LPNVG) from France.

LPNVGs @ TFB:

Thales LUCIE LPNVG

The photo above is what sparked my interest in the Thales LUCIE (LUnette Compacte Intensifiée Economique). It was allegedly a photo of a GIGN officer. Some commenters in the Solider Systems Daily post claim it was a promotional photo for MSA and their Gallet TC800 helmet. The Thales LUCIE is also issued to the German Bundeswehr. Regardless, I dig it and had to have one. Here is the LUCIE next to my other LPNVG, the Simrad GN1. I thought the GN1 was small, well, the LUCIE is smaller.

The LUCIE is not a binocular NVG but a biocular. Similar to a PVS-7 it has a single 10130 image intensifier tube and like a Simrad GN1, it is oriented sideways to keep the goggle low profile. The tube sits diagonally in the housing and projects the image into a beam splitter. So it shows up in both ocular lenses. Your eyes will see the same image so you will not get stereopsis (depth perception).

The LUCIE has all the same features a PVS-14 does. It has a daylight objective lens cover that is tethered to the housing.

The objective lens has a cutout in the outer ring and it indexes off a rectangular protrusion in the housing. This is your infinite and close focus stop.

On the left side of the housing is the on switch. It has a slight protrusion in the track to prevent accidental activation. Almost like a stick shift gate pattern. Once on, you can press the rubber circular button for momentary activation of the IR illuminator. Next to the illuminator is a bright light cutoff. If you want constant activation of the IR illuminator, you need to press the on switch inwards and rotate it up.

Just behind the on switch is the battery compartment. It is powered by a single AA battery for a run time of 45 hours. Just like the lens cap, the battery cap is tethered to the housing.

As I mentioned earlier, the Thales LUCIE is a biocular. It has two ocular eyepieces but a single tube. Unlike the PVS-7, the Lucie does not have an adjustable pupillary distance. It is fixed, similar to the Simrad GN1. This is due to the beam splitter design. It is like an inverted “y”. Moving the eyepieces left and right would require the beam splitter to have to physically change shape.

The eyepieces do have individually adjustable diopters.

On top of the housing is a proprietary dovetail shoe unlike the US which uses dovetails or bayonet horns.

Wearing The LUCIE On Your Face

The Thales LUCIE comes with a proprietary skull crusher. As far as skull crushers go, this one is one of the best.

The skull crusher has a mask that presses up against your face to hold up the LUCIE NVG. Due to the low profile nature of the LUCIE, there is not much pressure on your forehead.

The mount allows the LUCIE to flip up out of the way.

On the left side of the mount is a magnet. It controls the goggle so when you flip it up, the goggle will turn off. Flip it back down and the magnet will turn the goggle back on.

The mount itself does not flip. Rather the dovetail and latch are what flip 180º.

You can see the dovetail and shoe below.

What makes the Thales skull crusher one of the best is that the face mask/pads can fold inwards to make the entire headset smaller. You can see the arms below have stops so they cannot close tighter. They can only swing forwards for storage.

Looking top down, you can see the face pads at a fixed angle.

Here is what they look like when you fold the pads forward.

The skull crusher allows you to wear the goggles under a hood.

Helmet Mounting The Thales LUCIE

Thales makes a strap-on mount for helmets but I do not have one of those. This one only came with the skull crusher. However, there are aftermarket mounting solutions. Wilcox makes the G29 LUCIE mount so you can mount the goggle to a helmet with an NVG shroud.

The G29 mount comes with a dovetail adapter so you have a normal Wilxoc style dovetail on the LUCIE goggle.

You install the triangular insert into the molded dovetail shoe.

Then you place the Wilcox dovetail on top and bolt it down.

The G29 mount is designed to work with the LUCIE. A G24 mount can work but part of the mount touches the top of the goggle housing which can cause the dovetail to not entirely lock up. Also, the G24 only folds 90º. The G29 mount folds up past vertical.

The G29 mount has an articulating magnet so if you want the magnetic activation you can have it.

Or fold the magnet up out of the way and the goggle will not turn off when you flip the mount up.

Just above the magnet is the release button to fold the mount up and the tilt adjustment knob next to it. The skull crusher does not have any tilt adjustment.

On the other side is a rectangular tab. You have to pull the tab down to unlock it and then you can adjust the mount back and forth.

Can you use the PVS-21 Wilcox mount?

Yes, you can, but it is not ideal. At first glance, it seems like it could work.

However, it positions the LUCIE too low. Even with the mount adjusted as high as possible, it does not line up with the eyes. Another issue is the PVS-21 mount does not have tilt adjustment. The PVS-21 goggle has built-in tilt adjustment in the dovetail.

But you can flip the goggle 90º and past vertical.

Passive Aiming With The LUCIE

One issue I was concerned about is the ability to passively aim with the Thales goggle. The position of the objective lens is high and to the right of the user. It will work with optics on tall mounts like the GBRS Hydra. I did test a couple of guns with optics that sit too close to the face making them difficult to use with traditional night vision. First up is my G36 dual optic carry handle. It has a red dot on top of the 3X scope. I have it installed on my IWI X95.

It is not difficult to get the objective lens to look through the red dot.

Something else I tested with the Simrad GN1 was my FLUX raider. The brace positions my face too close for standard night vision to see through the red dot. But with the Thales LUCIE, I can aim passively.

Modifying The LUCIE

Since the Thales LUCIE is made in France, they come with Photonis tubes. The LUCIE uses 10130 tubes just like the PVS-7. If you recall, the SIMRAD GN1 uses 10160 tubes like in PVS-14s and binocular goggles.

So after checking that the Photonis tube functions, I swapped it out for my Elbit White Phosphor tube. While it works, I discovered there is a considerable amount of tint in the beam splitter. So the image projected out of the right ocular is shifted to look almost green. This defeats the purpose of installing a white phosphor tube. I ended up swapping the Elbit out for an Insight/L3 green phosphor tube so I can have gen 3 night vision in the LUCIE.

Accessories For The LUCIE

The new Argus NVG pouch perfectly fits the LUCIE in the accessories compartment in the lid while the skull crusher fits in the main compartment.

I also found this Thales pouch on eBay. It is for some sort of headset. The pouch has a waistband/belt while the main compartment fits the goggle perfectly.

I found the photos below on PrimePortal. They appear to be from a German Army display showcasing their gear. The helmet has a LUCIE goggle installed. You can see it has a lens cover that covers both ocular eyepieces.

Chinese LUCIE Clone

Thanks to Jacen Wu of Far East Tactical (@fareast_tactical) for sharing photos of his Chinese-made LUCIE clone.

The clone comes with two sets of eyecups. Two individual ones and a bikini-style set.

The markings for IR/ON/OFF are in Chinese.

He has a custom dovetail so he can use G24 style mounts with it.

Apparently, the Chinese even made an inverter mount. This reminds me of the one for the SIMRAD GN1. I believe this is so you can invert the LUCIE so the oculars are higher up and the goggle can fit under the brim of a helmet.

Final Thoughts On The Thales LUCIE

The LUCIE is a cool-looking night vision goggle. It was developed in the 90s and has a sci-fi aesthetic that I really like. It is not that heavy but they are not lightweight at around 438 grams or 15.4 ounces. That is close to a PVS-31A weight.

Thales designed the LUCIE to have 51º FOV compared to typical US night vision that have 40º FOV. The offset objective lens was only a minor issue when I tried driving my car at night. Since the objective lens is an inch or so above my eyes, my main rear view mirror required adjustment to see out the back. I did not notice much of an improvement with the 51º FOV but I did notice the lack of depth perception right away. I had to trust what my eyes saw but I felt a disconnect between where the car was with how far things are from it.

I like how small it is and since it uses PVS-7 style 10130 tubes, it is not difficult to swap the tubes out. One thing that is not great is the price. These are very rare and so fetch a high price. The last one I saw for sale, before acquiring this one, the seller was asking 4,000 euros for. I paid less than that but still more than I wanted to spend for a niche collectible. The Wilcox G29 mount costs $615 which is more than a G24. Sadly they do not sell the dovetail adapter on its own. One weakness of the LUCIE is the same as the PVS-7. The mounting interface is molded to the housing. If the dovetail shoe cracks, you cannot mount the goggle anymore.

I am glad to have the Thales LUCIE. But now I want the newer version, the MINIE or the MONIE monocular.

I would really like to check out a MINIE/D-IR with a thermal clip-on."
