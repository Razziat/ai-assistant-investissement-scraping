Contractor's focus is on what soldiers hear - The Washington Post - The Washington Post,"Sun, 15 Apr 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53YXNoaW5ndG9ucG9zdC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvY2FwaXRhbGJ1c2luZXNzL2NvbnRyYWN0b3JzLWZvY3VzLWlzLW9uLXdoYXQtc29sZGllcnMtaGVhci8yMDEyLzA0LzEzL2dJUUFiUVB0SlRfc3RvcnkuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As an executive at military radio firm Thales Communications, Gil Limonchik had heard plenty from soldiers about the difficulties they faced. With loud explosions and noisy equipment on the battlefield, soldiers were having trouble both communicating and protecting their hearing. “Governments invest a lot of money in tactical radio communications, but accessories are always an afterthought,” said Limonchik, a Special Forces veteran himself.

Nearly seven years ago, he established Rockville-based Silynx Communications, backed by Burbank, Calif.-based Shamrock Holdings.

The idea behind the company was to develop headsets that would protect soldiers’ ears while improving their ability to hear ambient noise around them and the instructions of other soldiers.

The gear has found fans. Silynx, which now has about 60 employees, has sold its headsets to the U.S. Special Operations Command, the Navy SEALs and the FBI’s SWAT team, among others. The privately held company declined to disclose its revenue.

Limonchik compares buying Silynx’s headsets to buying nice speakers for a fancy Bose radio system.

If you bought a $2,000 Bose system for your house, you wouldn’t want cheap speakers, he said. “In the tactical communications world, you need very high-end accessories.”

If that strategy sounds familiar, Loren Thompson, a defense industry consultant, said commercially-available tech products have increasingly influenced military purchases.

“Almost all of the relevant military technology is leveraged off commercial technology,” he said. “In that marketplace, accessories and apps are what it’s all about.”

Silynx designed the headsets to be “radio-agnostic,” meaning they would work with any brand of military radio. Additionally the headsets — which include earbuds — were designed to be hands-free so soldiers wouldn’t have to take their hands off their weapons, Limonchik said.

There is also a version that allows underwater use, as well as a wireless model that can be hidden under clothing.

The company, which manufactures the equipment at facilities in Frederick and St. Petersburg, Fla., operates in a culture of constant prototyping and is in its third generation of headsets. In its Rockville office, it has a lab featuring a dummy with human-like ears used to test the earbuds’ performance in high noise or under water. The company uses a three-dimensional printer to produce new prototypes daily.

“Once we even reach the 40-percent solution, we start providing the users operational prototypes,” Limonchik said.

In recent years, the company has expanded its products to include a control box soldiers wear on their chests, allowing them to use voice prompts to manage other systems they’re carrying, including radios or portable computers. The company has also produced a weapon grip that allows soldiers to control a weapon’s flashlight and laser-aiming device— as well as their headsets — without taking their hands off the trigger.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995174407958984}",neutral,0.9995174407958984,0
Proton Launches Yahsat 1B Ka-band Satellite - SpaceNews,"Tue, 24 Apr 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9wcm90b24tbGF1bmNoZXMteWFoc2F0LTFiLWthLWJhbmQtc2F0ZWxsaXRlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — An International Launch Services (ILS) Proton rocket on April 24 successfully placed the Yahsat 1B Ka-band civil/military telecommunications satellite into geostationary transfer orbit.

The launch completes the current in-orbit development program of Al Yah Satellite Communications of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, following the April 2011 launch of Yahsat 1A, which carries a mixed Ku-, C- and Ka-band payload.

Both spacecraft were built by Astrium Satellites and Thales Alenia Space of Europe under a $1.66 billion contract that included the satellites’ launch and the network ground infrastructure. Astrium Services, which is Astrium’s service provision arm and is overall prime contractor for the Yahsat system, will operate the two satellites with Thales Communication and Security for five years and provide training to Emirati personnel under the contract.

Yahsat 1B’s all-Ka-band payload will provide commercial broadband links through Yahsat’s YahClick service. Military Ka-band will be offered through a service called YahSecure.

YahSecure features a regional beam centered on Yahsat’s region. A global beam offers Ka-band to Southern, Central and Eastern Europe, all of Africa, and a large swath covering Central and South Asia, including India, and eastward including most of China and Southeast Asia.

The Ka-band service will also be allocated through 61 narrow spot beams.

The launch, from Russia’s Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, was followed by a cruise phase of the Proton’s Breeze M upper stage lasting nine hours and 12 minutes and including five engine ignitions before the 6,000-kilogram Yahsat 1B was released into orbit.

The launch was the third of 2012 for Reston, Va.-based ILS, and the fourth Proton rocket launch of the year. One of the Proton missions lofted a Russian government satellite.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999986886978149}",neutral,0.9999986886978149,0
VSHORAD – India's Next Big Air Defense Program - Defense Update,"Sun, 01 Apr 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5zZS11cGRhdGUuY29tLzIwMTIwNDAxX3ZzaG9yYWQtaW5kaWFzLW5leHQtYmlnLWFpci1kZWZlbnNlLXByb2dyYW0uaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Chief of the Indian Army has recently warned that 97 % of India’s Air Defense is obsolete. Given the fact that the Indian Armed Forces fully realize that they might have to fight a two-pronged war in the near future against China and Pakistan this claim of the Army Chief cannot be taken lightly. To make matters worse Israel’s IMI and Germany’s Rheinmetall Air Defense, both offering advanced air defense systems, have been banned from conducting business with the Indian Defense Ministry for the next 10 years.

India has to therefore seriously augment its Air Defense capabilities. Several ongoing programs include the replacement of SA-18 Very Short Range Air Defense Systems (VSHORAD), with modern weapons. The cost of the replacement, as anything in India – is huge: over replacement of about 800 launchers and initial delivery of 5,000 missiles, at a cost of 27,000 Crore (US$5.2 billion). Evaluations of some of the candidates are expected to commence in May–June this year. The ongoing DefExpo 2012 provides India with a unique opportunity to take a look at some of the most cutting edge Air Defense Systems that are on display.

In contrast to the passive (UV/IR) guided weapons currently in operation, two VSHORAD systems employing laser-beam riding semi-active command to line of sight (SACLOS) guidance technique stood out in this year’s DefExpo. While such systems are presumably heavier and more complex, the more affordable cost of their seekerless missiles is bound to come to effect in the evaluating the total cost of ownership (including missiles, test and practice rounds).

RBS 70/NG – SAAB’s RBS 70 comprises the missile in a launch container, a tripod firing stand and an optical sight. It is operable by one, and portable by three persons. The missile is outfitted with a solid propellant booster motor. When the operator fires the missile, the booster motor is ignited inside the launch tube and the missile is accelerated out of the tube. The control surfaces and the four fins open into position as the missile leaves the tube. The sustainer motor ignites after the missile has travelled a safe distance from the launch position.

The booster is subsequently jettisoned. The RBS 70 has laser beam riding guidance, riding a laser signal being beamed from its own launch station, rather than being guided from the front towards the reflected signal from a laser designated target. The missile operator can locate a hostile target visually or the target can be detected by a search radar. When the target is acquired, the operator tracks the target and the Raytheon Cossor IFF880 friend or foe system interrogates the target. If the target is identified as friendly, a warning light in the sight is illuminated and the firing sequence is halted. The operator aims the missile towards the target, fires and tracks the target, thus aiming the laser guidance beam continuously at the target until the moment of impact. Speaking to Defense Update Saab’s spokesperson stated that as the laser beam riding guidance of the RBS 70 is located in the tail of the missile, it is extremely difficult to jam it, since the missile has no seeker head at the front.

In 2011 Saab has introduced an improved version of the system, designated RBS 70NG (new generation), which is comprised of a new sight module, integrating a high resolution thermal imager allowing 24/7 operational capability.

The new module enables advanced cueing and an auto tracker, to improve reaction times and target acquisition, and engagement, thus increasing the hit probability throughout the missile range. Improved guidance has also been introduced, to further increase performance both for manual and auto-tracker engagements. The system has a built-in video recorder for after-action review. With these improvements RBS 70NG offers a flexible and scalable evolution to meet evolving Ground Based Air Defense requirements with Man-Portable Air Defense System (MANPADS) as well as with remote-controlled or vehicular applications.

StarStreak – Starstreak developed by the Thales group is a close-range anti-aircraft guided-weapon system designed for use against enemy helicopters and ground attack aircraft. Starstreak contains a two-stage solid propellant rocket motor, a separation system and three high-density darts. A pulse of power from the missile-firing unit sets off the first-stage motor that ignites and therefore increases the speed of the missile. The missile enters into a spin due the Canted nozzles. The efferent force of the roll causes the fins to unfold for aerodynamic stability in flight. Once clear of the canister, the motor is thrown out. The second-stage motor ignites and accelerates the missile to a velocity of Mach 4.

A severance system at the front end of the motor holds three darts. When the second stage motor is burnt out, the propulsion triggers the three darts to automatically break up. The darts sustain a high kinetic energy as they are steered to the same target. Each dart includes guidance and control circuitry, a thermal battery and a high-density penetrating warhead with fuse. The severance of the darts kicks off the arming of the specific warheads. Each dart is steered independently using a double laser beam riding system. As the dart collides with the target, the inertial forces trigger the delay fuse, allowing the warhead to penetrate before detonation.

MISTRAL-2 – Another competitor seeking the future Indian VSHORAD contract is the European company MBDA, offering the Mistral. This missile has already been selected to equip the Indian Dhruv Helicopter; therefore MBDA does have an advantage in terms of logistics and ordinance management. Moreover, the company has a production line for MILAN missiles established in India by Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL), where Mistral missiles could be produced, if the company wins this program. Other contenders include Rosoboronexport, offering a modern version of the IGLA-S (SA-24) and South Korean LIG Nex1, offering the Chiron.

IGLA-S (SA-24) – Similar to the Mistral, a major advantage of IGLA-S is its capability to use existing infrastructure, including DJIGHIT launchers and STERLETS command and control modules, or mobile carriers such as the SA-9 and SA-13 mobile air defense systems. IGLA-S offers superior performance over the IGLA / STRELA missiles, particularly in its immunity to countermeasures (conventional heat flares are useless against its IR seeker flares). According to Russian sources, it is also effective against fast, low flying cruise missiles or high flying but slow unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). With a warhead 1.5 times larger than its predecessors, IGLA-S also offers 20 percent range increase, able to hit targets at a distance of six kilometers.

CHIRON – The Korean LIG Nex1 Company has also entered the Indian VSHORAD, yet its product, the Chiron stands the lowest chance to win the technical or commercial phases. Although it uses elements of the Mistral missile to offer increased range over the Russian missile, its seeker, implementing Russian technology is considered less advanced than that of the SA-24. Reportedly, the Koreans are asking $175,000 per unit, which is more than double the cost of an IGLA-S.

India’s Air Defense guns like the L-70 and ZU-23 are 40 years old and missile systems like the SA-2 have also become obsolete. This coupled with the fact that there are huge loopholes in the radar network means that the sky’s above India are completely insecure. Corrective measures need to be taken immediately and this year’s Defense Expo has certainly provided the answer to India’s quest for a modern air defense system.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9918006062507629}",neutral,0.9918006062507629,0

A curious approach to SEA 1442 Phase 4 - APDR - Asia Pacific Defence Reporter,"Wed, 04 Apr 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vYXNpYXBhY2lmaWNkZWZlbmNlcmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tL2EtY3VyaW91cy1hcHByb2FjaC10by1zZWEtMTQ0Mi1waGFzZS00L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"SEA 1442 Phase 4

A curious approach to SEA 1442 Phase 4

Byline: Kym Bergmann / Canberra

Moving naval communications into the internet era is a high priority for the ADF and one of the more important projects is the multi-phase SEA 1442. The Defence Capability Plan says it:

“…..aims to upgrade and modernise maritime communications

systems on RAN ships to allow networked communications between selected major surface vessels within a task group.”

After definition study work, the first actual system to be introduced into service was provided by Thales, the 2008 winner of Phase 3 in what was originally a $45 million contract. The company describes their solution, based on commercial ICT technology thus:

“SEA 1442/3 has introduced an Internet Protocol (IP) based Maritime Tactical Wide Area Network (MTWAN) into the Royal Australian Navy, supporting the Australian Defence Force’s Network Centric Warfare concept….“

An early demonstration of the solution took place during Exercise Talisman Sabre in 2009 when the FFGs HMAS Darwin and HMAS Newcastle were able to communicate with each other using Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) and Video Conferencing. This was done in a secure military environment, using low power products and with VOIP as the IP “core“ rather than an add-on.

In essence, this is part of the process of moving maritime communications from the analog era to digital and is part of a global trend towards EOIP – Everything Over Internet Protocol. So far the Thales MTWAN has been fitted to the four FFGs, two ANZACs, HMAS Success, several shore installations and interestingly HMAS Choules – more on that shortly.

With this brief background, we now come to Phase 4, which has a projected value at the lower end of the $300 million – $500 million band and is to upgrade the communications systems of all eight ANZAC Frigates. The RFT closed in August 2011 and there were four responses. As has been previously reported, these were from Thales; Rhode & Schwartz; Rafael; and Selex.

The Department has down-selected these to Thales and possibly Rafael, but typically has not made an announcement to this effect and seems to be cagey about the details. Even in answer to a question about the purpose of Phase 4, the response was merely a repeat of what is in the DCP:

• upgraded network-capable switching;

• tactical intercom and secure voice system;

• cryptographic equipment to support secure communications;

• communications management system;

• high data rate line-of-sight capability; and upgraded radio system to support wideband networked communications.

Why Rohde & Schwartz in particular missed out when they are a key supplier on the Air Warfare Destroyer is a mystery.

When APDR started making inquiries of industry the result was one close to abject terror, with not a single company prepared to speak or provide information about their offers – or in the case of others to discuss why they did not bid. One of the most noticeable things about the four companies who did bid – or rather who APDR believes bid – is that not one is from the United States. This seems odd when one examines the pedigrees in naval communications of companies such as: Boeing; L-3; Lockheed Martin and Raytheon – to mention but the most obvious.

So what is going on? Two factors seem to be at work. The first is a concern that Thales are in such a good position that competing with them will be very difficult. The second is that the terms of tendering are so extraordinarily oppressive and risky that only the bravest – or silliest – company would sign up to them. The even higher than usual level of industry paranoia is an indication that something strange seems to be going on.

In an unusual approach to the tender, the Department apparently asked for companies to not only provide the communications suite but also to be responsible for its installation – thereby bypassing the ANZAC In Service Support Alliance (made up of BAE Systems, Saab Systems and the Department of Defence). But not only that, bidders were apparently informed that they would be told by Defence when ships would be available and that they would be given a fairly short 3 month notice period. But on top of that, the successful bidder would be liable for liquidated damages of $450,000 per day for every day late – in circumstances where the selected company would have limited control over the schedule.

Additionally, data packs were only available at very short notice.

The Department must have been aware that US companies in particular would never sign up to such a contracting formula. The decision to bypass the ANZAC Alliance seems to be an important factor in the way things have played out. It has been well known for many years that some senior Departmental personnel have been critical of the costs of the Alliance – even though Defence itself is a contributor to the overhead. In recent times BAE Systems – responsible for physical installation tasks – has received a particular bashing for their costs.

It might be that the Department in delivering a slap to BAE Systems has instead come up with a structure that has greatly limited the amount of choice available to it.

Making an assessment of the respective merits of Thales and possibly Rafael in these circumstances is difficult. Rafael have presumably based their solution on the C4I-ConNect product, described in part:

“I-ConNect technologies provides the modern battlefield and C&C centers with the ability to incorporate Voice, Radio, Video, Data and Telephony applications over the standard IP network.

“Using this everything-over-IP technology the C4I-ConNect solution creates a full connectivity and acts as the cornerstone of the modern Network-Centric Warfare (NCW).”

Certainly this marketing language is entirely consistent with what the RAN says they are trying to achieve. In addition, Rafael have a related system, SEA-COM:

“Within the framework of developing communications and control capabilities for the modern battlefield, RAFAEL has developed Sea-Com – a tactical communications suite for sea-going vessels.

Israeli in general is a world leader in communications technology and Rafael has been involved in a variety of related activities, not just those described above.

Thales also has an excellent pedigree, as discussed with reference to SEA 1442 Phase 3. The company can not only draw on Australian in-house skills that can probably be traced back to ADI’s acquisition of Stanilite in the mid-1990s, well before being purchased by Thales. The parent French company also has a very strong background in maritime communications and has been at the leading edge of the use of IP-based open architecture solutions. When combined with the company’s network centric warfare laboratory in Sydney it is not hard to see why several rivals have calculated that there is little point in trying to compete. Furthermore the most recent relevant decision regarding surface ship communications was to award a contract to Thales to upgrade HMAS Choules.

Selex will neither confirm nor deny that they are even bidding.

Without detracted in any way from what Rafael – or anyone else – might have offered, for them to win would seem to cut across all recent trends in RAN maritime communications – but this is Australia and one should never expect consistency or commonality to be factors in any final decision.

Thales and possibly Rafael or possibly someone else are now engaged in an Offer Definition Activity. The failure of any company to respond to requests for information is an indication that the Department has again muzzled them with the usual blanket clause forbidding them to publicly discuss their tender on pain of being kicked out of the competition. The Department itself has confirmed that they expect to go to Government for Second Pass Approval in 2012 / 2013, which might be an indication that the ODA is limited in scope and timing.

If anyone has the courage to say more on the topic, APDR will take the call. The Department is up to something.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999867677688599}",neutral,0.9999867677688599,0
