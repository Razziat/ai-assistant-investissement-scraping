Thales Group, a longtime securer of virtualized systems and a provider of data protection to the financial services, manufacturing, government and technology sectors, revealed Oct. 19 that it will acquire data-centric protection firm Vormetric for $400 million.

Data-centric security defines a trend in IT in which the primary function is the management and manipulation of data itself, rather than security focused primarily on the application, networking or storage. This type of security follows the data item or store around wherever it travels—on-premises or off.

With the advent of virtualized IT systems, the worldwide explosion in the use of cloud and managed services, and the increasing usage of data storage and big data analytics inside clouds, data is often separated in so-called “chunks” for security purposes and spread in various locations. Later, when the entire file is needed, systems reassemble these chunks—usually with a just-in-time methodology.

All this movement has made security a central problem, and data-centric security—centered around government-level encryption—has come to the rescue as the only way to handle all this travel in a reliable fashion.

Fills Some Gaps

The acquisition of Vormetric, which will be integrated into the Thales e-Security subsidiary after the deal closes, brings Thales (pronounced “TALL-iss”) a range of proprietary data-centric security technologies that it had lacked.

Fourteen-year-old Vormetric, based in San Jose, Calif., provides products that are able to be deployed individually while also being centrally managed, including file-level encryption, application-layer encryption, tokenization, cloud encryption gateway, integrated key management, and security intelligence logging.

This dovetails with Thales’s long-term approach to security, company President Cindy Provin said.

“The combination of our two organizations will provide comprehensive data protection solutions to the enterprise enabling data-centric security on premise, in the cloud and across all applications, including big data,” Provin said. “This acquisition delivers a strong foundation of security application technology that enables us to evolve our trust management strategy and offer our customers the world’s leading data security solutions.”

Need for Data-Centric Security Will Continue to Grow

Alan Kessler, President and CEO of Vormetric, said the current cyber-security environment calls for extensive growth of data protection services. “Our shared vision is one of seamless data-centric protection across the enterprise,” Kessler said.

Vormetric has a workforce of 200 employees and counts about 1,500 enterprises, including 17 of the U.S. largest 30 companies, to protect their sensitive data from both internal and external threats. The company’s scalable Vormetric Data Security Platform protects any file, any database and any application’s data—anywhere it resides—with a high-performance, market-leading solution set. The company revenues are on pace to reach $75 million for the current fiscal year.

France-based Thales Group is among the world’s market leaders in hardware security modules (HSMs), which protect numerous critical networks and the data of 19 of the 20 largest banks in the world, the company said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9938192963600159}",neutral,0.9938192963600159,0

Thales’s Watchkeeper achieves another first in aviation history - EDR Magazine,"Sun, 18 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmV1L3RoYWxlc3Mtd2F0Y2hrZWVwZXItYWNoaWV2ZXMtYW5vdGhlci1maXJzdC1pbi1hdmlhdGlvbi1oaXN0b3J50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales announced that for the first time, Watchkeeper Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) was successfully flown alongside manned aircraft in controlled civil airspace. Watchkeeper, the only certified platform of its class able to undertake such a flight, was central to the success of the trial.

The flight took place on Wednesday 30 September and saw Watchkeeper fly from West Wales Airport into civil controlled airspace for an hour, where it was successfully managed by NATS, the UK air navigation services provider, for the first time.

The flight forms part of Project CLAIRE, a collaboration between Thales, NATS, the Dutch National Aerospace Laboratory NLR, the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD) and the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and was joint funded by the SESAR Joint Undertaking.

This new breakthrough is once more an innovative step for Watchkeeper, the largest single European UAS programme, having already been the first UAS of its type to be awarded a Release to Service (RTS) or equivalent in Europe.

Its type assurance and certification allows Watchkeeper to fly in non- segregated airspace, a certification pedigree that is transferable to regulatory authorities within other NATO member countries and the European Aviation Safety Agency.

Using Watchkeeper, this aviation first will help develop the necessary operational and regulatory conditions to support a growing need for unmanned aircraft system to be used in commercial, search and rescue, homeland security tasks, critical infrastructure and border protection.

Air Commodore Pete Grinsted, Head of Unmanned Air Systems Team at the MOD’s Defence, Equipment and Support organisation, said: “This is a landmark achievement for UK aviation history and the Watchkeeper programme, and was only possible thanks to a collaborative approach involving Thales, CAA, NATS and the MOD.

“The successful flight is the result of months of systematic planning to ensure Watchkeeper was safely controlled by UK Air Traffic Control agencies at all times. This is also an exciting step on the path to safely integrating military and civilian unmanned air systems into civilian airspace over the coming years.”

This flight together with the successful delivery of Watchkeeper into service demonstrates how Watchkeeper X, our tactical product, based on the British Watchkeeper programme, provides a strong solution to meet the requirements of both France’s UAS programme and Poland’s Gryf Tactical UAS programme.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9978424310684204}",positive,0.9978424310684204,1
Watchkeepers: Boxed… - The Bureau of Investigative Journalism,"Fri, 02 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVidXJlYXVpbnZlc3RpZ2F0ZXMuY29tL3N0b3JpZXMvMjAxNS0xMC0wMi9ib3hlZC11cC1iYXJlbHktdXNlZC1hbmQtNC15ZWFycy1sYXRlLXdhdGNoa2VlcGVyLXRoZS1hcm15cy1hZmZvcmRhYmxlLTEtMmJuLWRyb25lLXByb2dyYW1tZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A landmark Ministry of Defence order for 54 battlefield drones that was hailed by ministers a decade ago as an “affordable solution” will be four years late and cost £1.2bn – some £400m more than the public was first told.



The order for the Watchkeeper drones was announced by former Defence Secretary John Reid at the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2005 when he agreed costs of £800m and told Parliament they would start being ready for service five years later.

He also told taxpayers the bespoke order – Britain’s biggest ever on drones – would be “key to battlefield surveillance of the future” and a major boost to the country’s long term involvement in the technology.

Yet 10 years after the contract with a consortium led by French defence giant Thales was signed, only 33 of the fleet have been delivered.

In all, only three have actually been used in active operations – belatedly in Afghanistan just weeks before the troop withdrawal of late 2014, and for a total of 146 hours, equivalent to two days’ flying each.

At the end of June, those three were among only eight under Army control – at Boscombe Down on the Salisbury Plain where they are now used for training. Twenty-one were at a testing centre in west Wales, where most were boxed up in MoD storage.

Since June, four more have been delivered by Thales to the MoD.

The Bureau investigation – carried out in collaboration with the Guardian – into the UK’s most ambitious drone programme comes three months after David Cameron tasked defence chiefs to examine how drones could help defeat ISIS.

Watchkeeper specs. Wingspan: 11 metres

Top speed: 175kph

Max altitude: 4,500 metres

Range: 140km

Endurance: 16 hours

But the current nature of the conflict in Iraq and Syria means it is unlikely Watchkeeper will be deployed there. Whereas other drones such as Reaper – which are flown by the RAF – are operated by satellite and can be controlled thousands of miles away, Watchkeeper is piloted by radio signals, so requires troops on the ground close by.

Whether Watchkeeper could be currently deployed in any great number even were there to be troops on the ground is also open to question.

The Bureau has learnt through a Freedom of Information request that the Army has only six Watchkeeper pilots trained to fly the drones. Military commanders expect to have 24 pilots ready by 2017, while at the peak of its future operations in “following years”, they would like 100 in “operational, instructional and assurance roles”.

Instead of all 54 being ready by April 2013 as first planned, software glitches, stricter aerospace regulations and Army staff shortages have meant the latest date for “full operational capability” is now 2017 at the earliest – a delay of at least four years.

Even hitting that target “will require considerable further development”, the MoD has conceded.

The spreadsheet also states the estimated cost for the Watchkeeper project now stands at £1.2bn.

“The capability is still in development and will require considerable further development to reach the Full Operating Capability in 2017,” notes contained in the spreadsheet reveal.

The figure of £1.2bn includes the £800m announced by the MoD in 2005 – which consisted of a proposed £700m to Thales and a further £100m of Government capital costs – plus bills incurred during the pre-contract assessment phase, other elements caused by the various delays and setbacks over the years, plus charges from the drones’ deployment in Afghanistan.

The MoD says it is “wrong” to compare the two figures but a spokesman was unable to say how much will eventually be paid to Thales for the entire project, or even what has been paid to the consortium to date.

The MoD has also incurred other costs as a result of the delays.

Ordered at the height of the Afghanistan war, Watchkeeper, which does not carry weapons, was designed from scratch for the Army, with the aim to provide aerial surveillance for troops on the ground.

But the inability to place the drone into service until 2014 exacerbated a “capability gap” for military commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan who had been forced to lease nine Hermes 450 drones from Israeli aerospace firm Elbit.

The Bureau has discovered that the total cost of that deal, which ended last January, was £206m over seven years.

Colonel Richard Kemp, who led Britain’s first Army presence in Afghanistan in 2003, said Watchkeeper was “just the latest of a string of examples of overdue and overcost defence equipment projects”.

He said the drone was “an essential element of British forces’ surveillance, command and target acquisition capability”, adding: “Without it our ability to fight is severely degraded.

“The lesson here must be that we should be far more willing to purchase proven off the shelf solutions, especially those developed by the United States, rather than always insisting on our own bespoke technology.

“Only too often in defence procurement the perfect is the enemy of the good. And there is no point striving for perfection if it arrives too late to actually do the job.”

An MoD spokesman said: “Watchkeeper has already proven its value in Afghanistan and will provide the British Army with a cutting edge remotely piloted air system.”

A Thales spokesman said “significant improvements to aircraft safety regulations and certification in the UK” had added to the delays. “Watchkeeper is the first and only UAS [unmanned aerial system] of its type to have undergone the rigorous testing and certification demanded in this improved regulatory landscape,” he added.

The demand for Watchkeeper was borne out of the need to replace the Army’s Phoenix drone, a piece of British-built equipment considered so poor it was widely known among military personnel as “the Bugger Off” due to its frequent failure to return from missions.

Watchkeeper was an attempt to bring cutting edge technology to Army operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Its specifications impressed military chiefs. Its reinforced landing gear means it does not need tarmac runways and it can instead use rough airstrips deeper into battlefield operations where troops would have sophisticated surveillance technology watching over them.

Its ability to carry two sensors, one providing TV and infrared camera feeds and the other carrying sophisticated radar systems, gave it an advantage over other drones such as Hermes, which could only carry one kind of pod at a time.

But despite a senior Army officer claiming at this year’s Paris air show that Watchkeeper provides a “step change in intelligence gathering”, its limited range of 140km, which requires it to have troops on the ground in control stations, means it has never been used against Isis.

First conceived in 2000, the contract to develop and build Watchkeeper was awarded five years later to the consortium between Thales and Elbit.

It has been on the radar of Whitehall’s public spending watchdogs ever since. Even the assessment phase to choose a winning bid to supply surveillance drones went over budget by £13m to £65m, according to a National Audit Office report in 2009.

In 2008 the MoD told the Defence Select Committee the project would be delivered early and under budget.

Watchkeeper was meant to have its maiden flight in the UK at the end of 2009, but this was delayed until April 2010 when the first of the drones were actually supposed to enter service.

A 2011 National Audit Office report that examined the delays outlined a series of technical problems with the drone’s “core software providing all mission functionality”.

There were also reportedly problems with the automatic take-off and landing system.

The project then missed a revised “in service date” of 2012 before finally being given the green light in the UK in March 2014.

The MoD will continue using the Watchkeeper drones for training as well as testing and development at Parc Aberporth in west Wales.





Justin Bronk, an analyst at the military think tank Rusi, said Watchkeeper “was certainly procured with an eye to the last war”. He said it fills “a very interesting middle ground between the micro reconnaissance [drones]… that the army use, British and US, and the kind of large… Global Hawks and Reapers and Predators that the Air Force use”.

He added: “There is an operational niche for it but whether it continues to be funded long term is another matter.”

Drones expert Chris Woods, author of Sudden Justice, said: “The government is spending £1.2bn on an asset that can’t be used in the kinds of wars we’re now fighting.”

The Watchkeeper X UAS has a maximum transit speed of 95k. Image: courtesy of Thales.

Watchkeeper X (WK X) is a high-performance, tactical, unmanned aircraft system (UAS) developed by French electronic systems company Thales for military and homeland security missions. It was launched at the DSEI 2015 defence exhibition held in London, UK, in September 2015.

The UAS is intended to accurate and persistent intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance (ISTAR).

Skylark I-LEX Mini Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS), Israel Skylark I-LEX is a new generation, man-portable, electric-propelled, mini UAS manufactured by Elbit Systems.

Thales and WB Electronics partnered in July 2015 to develop the armed version of the Watchkeeper X UAS for the Polish Armed Forces’ Gryf programme. The armed aircraft system was unveiled at the MSPO international defence industry exhibition in September 2015.

Watchkeeper X UAS design and features

The Watchkeeper X UAS is based on the Watchkeeper (WK450) UAS, a derivative of Elbit Systems’ Hermes 450 unmanned aerial vehicle developed by Thales for the UK Army.

The new UAS features a modular design that complies with the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) / Military Aviation Authority (MAA) standards and enables expeditionary and covert operations. It has de-icing and rough strip airfield capabilities, and offers high-mobility.

The UAS is built to CS23 / STANAG 4671 airworthiness certification standards. It operates as a multi-mission airborne surveillance system and can be integrated with a wide variety of interchangeable sensors based on the mission needs.

It can be transported by a variety of vehicle types and can be rapidly deployed by air, land or sea-based platforms and featuresautomatic take-off and landing systems (ATOLS).

A fully autonomous mission control system provides independent control of all aspects, including decision-making and target detection during the flight. The drone is also installed with an on-board power management system.

Sensors aboard Watchkeeper X

The unmanned aircraft is equipped with a standard 15in gimbaled payload camera for capturing intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance data during daytime and a night camera for operations in low or zero-visibility conditions. It can also be fitted with a high-definition camera, and ground and maritime surveillance radars for the detection of targets on land and over water respectively.

The UAS is capable of carrying dual sensor cross-cueing to deliver operational flexibility. The optional sensors include communications intelligence (CommINT), cryptographic electronic support measures (CESM) and radar electronic support measures (RESM).

Mission systems

The encryption, in-flight analysis and post-flight analysis devices allow the operator to extract intelligence data from the captured information. A STANAG C4I standard interface enables sharing of vital information between the UAS operators and other operating parties connected in the same network.

“The armed aircraft system was unveiled at the MSPO international defence industry exhibition in September 2015.”

The captured data will be transmitted to the ground control station through the data links in real-time. The UAS uses remote terminals for the transmission of telemetry data to a master control system.

Other mission systems aboard the drone include voice communications, recorders, and command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence (C4I) target authorisation systems.

Armament of Watchkeeper X

The Watchkeeper X can be weaponised with Thales’ Free Fall Light Multirole Missile (FF LLM) precision-guided glide munitions to engage both fixed and moving targets in tactical ISTAR missions. It can also be equipped with STANAG standard weapons control systems.

The on-board laser designator and laser target marker systems deliver improved target accuracy and quick engagement of targets.

Ground control station

The unmanned air vehicle and its payloads are controlled by operators from a standard ground control station. The drone can be operated by a ship-board control station when deployed in maritime missions.

Performance

The unmanned air vehicle can fly at a maximum transit speed of 95k, and has an operating range of 140km and endurance of more than 16h. Its robust design permits operation in hostile environments, difficult weather conditions and extreme temperatures.

UK's £1.2bn bill for drone that's seen 146 hours of active duty - The Guardian,"Fri, 02 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDE1L29jdC8wMi93YXRjaGtlZXBlci1kcm9uZS11ay1taWxpdGFyeS1kZWxheS1vdmVyLWJ1ZGdldC1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9u0gFraHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL3dvcmxkLzIwMTUvb2N0LzAyL3dhdGNoa2VlcGVyLWRyb25lLXVrLW1pbGl0YXJ5LWRlbGF5LW92ZXItYnVkZ2V0LWludmVzdGlnYXRpb24?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A British army drone developed as an affordable solution is four years late and expected to cost £1.2bn to become fully operational, an investigation has found.

The order to design and build 54 Watchkeeper surveillance drones was announced by the then defence secretary John Reid in 2005, who said they would be “key to battlefield surveillance of the future”. He signed off on costs of about £800m, with the contract going to a consortium led by the French defence firm Thales.

The first Watchkeeper drones were expected to enter service from 2010 and be fully operational by 2013, but software glitches and army staff shortages have meant the date is now 2017 at the earliest.

A joint investigation by the non-profit Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the Guardian has revealed that the project is expected to cost significantly more than originally planned.



After 10 years in development, only three Watchkeeper drones have seen active duty, arriving in Afghanistan weeks before last year’s troop withdrawal. The drones flew for a total of 146 hours, equivalent to two days each, before British forces left the country.

So far, 33 of the 54 Watchkeeper drones have been delivered. Eight are being used for army training on Salisbury Plain, while most are boxed up and in storage.

Col Richard Kemp, a former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, said Watchkeeper was “just the latest of a string of examples of overdue and overcost defence equipment projects”.

He said: “Only too often in defence procurement, the perfect is the enemy of the good. And there is no point striving for perfection if it arrives too late to actually do the job.”

Unlike other drone models such as Reaper, which operate by satellite, Watchkeeper is piloted by radio signals and requires troops on the ground in order to function. A defence spokesman explained that this allows it to be used more directly by commanders to survey the battlefield.

Watchkeeper has not been used in the RAF-led air missions in Libya and Iraq, or in Syria, where Reapers are providing a third of all surveillance flights to the US-led coalition.

Commenting on the remotely piloted aircraft’s reliance on radio, Chris Woods, the author of Sudden Justice, a book on drones, said: “The problem with Watchkeeper is it’s yesterday’s technology pretending to be tomorrow’s.”

Woods also pointed to the fact that they had not been used in the UK’s most recent operations abroad. “The government is spending £1.2bn on an asset that is not being used in the kinds of aerial-led wars we’re now fighting.”

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has admitted that even hitting the 2017 target to be fully operational “will require considerable further development”. Another problem is the lack of trained pilots: currently the army only has six, but it expects this to rise to 100 when the drone is fully operational.

A Thales spokesman said “significant improvements to aircraft safety regulations and certification in the UK” had added to the delays. “Watchkeeper is the first and only UAS [unmanned aerial system] of its type to have undergone the rigorous testing and certification demanded in this improved regulatory landscape.“Thales and the UK MoD have worked together to deliver a world-leading capability for the British army, through a complex technology programme to grow an emerging technology into a certified and airworthy unmanned aircraft system.”

An MoD spokesman said: “Watchkeeper has already proven its value in Afghanistan and will provide the British army with a cutting-edge, remotely piloted air system. The project is on track to meet its planned full operational capability of mid-2017.”

Watchkeeper was commissioned to replace another British-designed unmanned aircraft, the Phoenix, which cost £345m to develop and left service after six years. It was forced to land on its back because of the low-slung technical equipment on the underside, and was known among troops as the “Bugger Off” owing to its frequent failure to return from missions.

With Watchkeeper delayed, the MoD was forced to plug the gap by spending £206m on leasing nine Hermes 450 drones from the Israeli aerospace firm Elbit, which is part of the Thales-led consortium.

Maj Richard Streatfeild, who commanded troops in Sangin, Helmand, in 2009-10 and wrote a book, Honourable Warriors, said Watchkeeper would have been an invaluable asset for operations in Afghanistan as a force multiplier. “That’s a small bit of equipment that makes a huge difference … If you’re able to gather that much more information, then it’s going to make a big difference.“It’s impossible to determine precisely what the impact [of having Watchkeeper] would have been. But the difficulty with the Afghan campaign overall was that we were always very constrained with the resources allocated.”

Watchkeeper was hailed by Reid as an affordable solution when he first announced the contract in 2005. The project was said at the time to cost £800m.

A decade on, it currently stands at £927m. A defence spokesman explained that this includes some additional costs such as the deployment of the trio of aircraft to Afghanistan. A report by the Major Projects Authority published in June reveals that the estimated cost of achieving full operation is now £1.2bn.

The costly delays of Watchkeeper are in contrast to the US army project to acquire a large drone independent of the air force. It has bought the Gray Eagle, of the same family as the Reaper drone, from the manufacturer General Atomics. This is satellite and radio controlled and can carry missiles.Kemp said: “The lesson here must be that we should be far more willing to purchase proven off-the-shelf solutions, especially those developed by the United States, rather than always insisting on our own bespoke technology.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999823570251465}",neutral,0.9999823570251465,0

The shoulder-launched Starstreak. The lightweight multiple launcher. Armoured Starstreak is a self-propelled Starstreak system. The aiming unit of the Starstreak system. The Starstreak missile.

Starstreak is a close-range anti-air guided-weapon system for use against helicopters and high-speed ground attack aircraft. The system is produced by Thales Air Defence Ltd (TADL), formerly Shorts Missile Systems, based in Belfast, Northern Ireland.

The Starstreak self-propelled, high-velocity missile (SP HVM) system has been in service with the British Army since 1997, with the lightweight multiple launcher (LML) and shoulder-launched versions since September 2000.

The original order of 135 systems was completed and a five-year production contract was awarded to Shorts in December 1999. A follow-on contract, with deliveries starting in 2007, was awarded in July 2004.

Deployment is with the 12th regiment in three batteries of 36 systems. Starstreak received export clearance for the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) in September 1999.

In July 2004, the UK MoD announced that the number of Starstreak HVM units in the army was to be reduced from 156 to 84 fire units.

Starstreak surface-to-air missile system orders and deliveries

“Starstreak is a close-range anti-air guided-weapon system for use against helicopters and high-speed ground attack aircraft.”

In December 2002, the South African Army ordered eight Starstreak lightweight multiple launchers. The systems were supplied by Kentron. The order formed the first phase of South Africa’s ground-based air defence local warning segment. The systems are supported by two Thales Page radars. The launchers were delivered in October 2005. The South African Army began missile firing trials in October 2007, and Starstreak entered service in 2010.

In July 2001, TADL received a contract for a SIFF (successor identification friend or foe) system for the Starstreak HVM. French firm Thales Communications is the main subcontractor.

In November 2012, Thales UK signed a contract with the Royal Thai Army to supply the Starstreak air defence missile system.

The Starstreak missiles were deployed by the British Army to protect London during the Olympic Games held in 2012. The UK MoD ordered an additional 200 Starstreak missiles in October 2013.

In January 2014, the Indonesian Ministry of Defence awarded a contract to Thales UK for the supply of Starstreak missiles coupled with Thales’ ForceSHIELD integrated advanced air defence system.

A follow-on contract was placed by DataGate for the delivery of Starstreak missiles and lightweight multiple launchers to the Royal Thai Army in September 2015. Malaysia’s Global Komited placed a contract for Starstreak missiles and ForceSHIELD air defence systems in the same month.

Starstreak and Rapier ground-based air defence programme

A new air defence command-and-control system named ADC4I was developed for phase one of the UK MoD’s ground-based air defence (GBAD) programme. The system integrates Starstreak and the Rapier FSC air defence missile system to provide network-enabled capabilities. Phase two involved the upgrading of the missile systems. MBDA and EADS Defence & Communications were awarded the contract for the assessment phase of the programme in December 2003.

Starstreak II extended range surface-to-air missile system

In September 2007, Thales announced the development of Starstreak II, which has an extended range of more than 7km, increased coverage and altitude, and improved precision guidance.

Thales is also developing the multi-mission system (MMS), which is a lightweight vehicle-mounted turret system, which can be equipped with the Starstreak and/or other missiles such as anti-armour missiles or rocket systems. The system has automatic target tracking and can be integrated into a network-enabled force structure.

The Starstreak II system was successfully demonstrated to the UK MoD in March 2008. The upgraded launcher and missile were tested in November 2010. The system was showcased at the IMDEX maritime defence show in May 2011.

In January 2008, Thales was awarded a contract by the UK MoD for the capability support of the Starstreak systems until 2020. The contract also includes the supply of a new fire control system and automatic target tracking for the SP HVM.

Starstreak missile system details

The missile consists of a two-stage solid propellant rocket motor, a separation system and three high-density darts. A pulse from the missile firing unit causes the first-stage motor to ignite, acceleraterating the missile.

Canted nozzles on the missile cause it to roll. The centrifugal force of the roll causes the fins to unfold for aerodynamic stability in flight.

Once clear of the canister, the motor is jettisoned. The second-stage motor ignites and accelerates the missile to a velocity greater than Mach 4. A separation system at the front end of the motor contains three darts. When the second stage motor is burnt out, the thrust triggers these darts to automatically separate.

The darts maintain high-kinetic energy as they are guided to the same single target. Each dart contains guidance and control circuitry, a thermal battery and a high-density penetrating warhead with fuse.

The separation of the darts initiates the arming of the individual warheads. Each dart is guided independently using a double laser-beam riding system. As the dart impacts the target, the inertial forces activate the delay fuse, allowing the warhead to penetrate before detonation.

Starstreak self-propelled high-velocity missile (SP HVM) system

The Starstreak SP HVM is mounted on a tracked BAE Systems Land Systems (formerly Alvis) Stormer vehicle. The system carries 12 Starstreak missiles, as well as eight rounds of ready-to-fire missiles.

“In July 2004, the UK MoD announced that the number of Starstreak HVM units in the British Army was to be reduced from 156 to 84 fire units.”

SP HVM is fitted with a roof-mounted air defence alerting device (ADAD), supplied by Thales (formerly Pilkington) Optronics. ADAD’s infrared scanner and processor provide target detection and prioritisation, and the system automatically slews the weapon sight onto the target. The use of ADAD requires that the vehicle be, briefly, stationary.

A panoramic weapon sight is supplied by Avimo (now part of Thales) and located at the front right of the vehicle. Thales Optronics has been awarded a contract to supply a new thermal sighting system for the British Army SP HVM.

The system is based on STAIRS C (sensor technology affordable infrared systems) technology, developed by Thales Optronics and the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA), now called QinetiQ.

ATASK, air-to-air Starstreak, tested by the US Army

An airborne variant of Starstreak, ATASK provides air-to-air capabilities for attack helicopters. ATASK has been tested for the US Army on the Apache attack helicopter.

The first phase of the programme involved the launch of six Starstreak missiles from an Apache helicopter at the Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona. In November 1998, ATASK successfully hit targets during the airborne firing tests. During the second phase, Starstreak’s laser beam guidance system was integrated with the target acquisition sight (TADS) and fire control system of the Apache.

Shoulder-launched Starstreak and lightweight multiple launcher

The portable, shoulder-launched Starstreak is assembled and ready to fire in a few seconds. Preparation for firing involves clipping an aiming unit onto the missile canister.

The aiming unit includes an optical head consisting of a stabilisation system, an aiming mark injector and a monocular sight. The target is acquired and optically tracked using the monocular sight and aiming mark.

In service with the British Army, the lightweight multiple launcher (LML) is integrated with Thales Air Defence ASPIC automatic fire unit and can be carried on any light-wheeled vehicle such as a Land Rover or HMMWV.

The multiple launcher employs three canistered missiles with clip-on equipment and a standard aiming unit. Three targets can be engaged in quick succession without the need for reloading.

Aussie Hawkei wins $billion ADF contract - CONTACT magazine,"Mon, 05 Oct 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnRhY3RhaXJsYW5kYW5kc2VhLmNvbS8yMDE1LzEwLzA1L2F1c3NpZS1oYXdrZWktd2lucy1iaWxsaW9uLWFkZi1jb250cmFjdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Aussie-designed-and-built Hawkei has won the ADF’s contract for a light protected mobility vehicle.

Designed and built by Thales in Bendigo, Victoria – the same factory that spawned the much-loved Bushmaster – Hawkei is in many ways a ‘baby Bushmaster’, with similar blast and ballistic protection, but in a much lighter package.

Hell, it even rolls on the same chunky wheels as the Bushmaster!

Today’s announcement was made by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Defence Minister Marise Payne, at the Land Engineering Agency Proving Ground in Monegeetta, Victoria, where Hawkei has been undergoing gruelling suitability testing alongside other, foreign, contenders for the project.

Project LAND 121 Phase 4 will provide the Australian Army with protected mobility vehicles – light (PMV-L) for command, liaison, utility and reconnaissance roles.

The LAND 121 Phase 4 contract as signed today with Thales is a $1.3billion project that will provide a fleet of around 1100 vehicles and 1000 trailers.

Chris Jenkins, CEO of Thales in Australia said this was a great day for the ADF and for Australian industry.

“Hawkei is a highly capable vehicle that will serve this country well for many years to come, and we are delighted that the Department of Defence has recognised the importance of this vehicle by reaching this milestone,” Mr Jenkins said.

“We are proud to have been chosen to deliver this next generation of protected vehicles to our armed forces, and we stand by them ready to support and adapt it as their requirements evolve.

“We also thank our many suppliers on the program – companies in Australia and overseas that have been with us on this long journey, and who have played a significant role in shaping the Hawkei and contributing to its success. It’s a great story about what Australian industry and international partnerships can achieve.

“As we move into the manufacturing phase, we will now be able to consolidate the work already begun across the Thales group worldwide to ensure the export success of this impressive vehicle.”

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the Hawkei would improve protection for soldiers and enable them to operate in high-risk areas.

“It is the only protected mobility vehicle in the ADF that can be transported by ADF helicopters,” he said.

“Under this $1.3 billion agreement, the vehicles will be manufactured at Thales Australia’s production line in Bendigo, creating 170 jobs there and another 60 jobs [across] Victoria.

“Since 2004, the Thales assembly line has been producing the highly successful Bushmaster, widely recognised as one of the finest vehicles of its type in the world.

“As Bushmaster production winds down, the start of pilot vehicle production in early 2016 will secure the highly skilled Bendigo workforce for full-rate production of the Hawkei in 2018.”

Prime Minister Turnbull said Hawkei would also pioneer a next generation communications management system to be developed in Australia by Thales.

Watch Hawkei demo its abilities on the European show circuit.

“It is absolutely critical our troops are able to be protected.

“The men and women of our armed services are entitled to the best equipment we can provide them to do their job and do it well, to faithfully defend our nation and our national interests.

“The Hawkei has met this mandate.”

The new Hawkei vehicles are produced by defence contractor Thales. (Department of Defence)

Mr Turnbull gets to know the new vehicles. (AAP)

The Hawkeis will replace sections of the army’s aging fleet of unarmoured Land Rovers from 2019, and Mr Turnbull said the Hawkei would develop as technology changed.

“Most of all, it has been designed with the future in mind,” he said.

“As new technology becomes available, it can be engineered into the vehicle.

“This is a vehicle for the 21st century, manoeuvrable and adaptable.

“This is the type of technology this nation does exceptionally well.”

On its website, Thales promotes the Hawkei as a high-tech, highly mobile and ballistic-proof vehicle.

“The Hawkei Light Protected Vehicle fulfils a number of operational roles and takes advantage of its small size to move stealthily, remain hidden and provide levels of coverage and safety that military operations require,” the contractor says.

“The vehicle will be equipped with weapons and systems that will provide unparalleled situational awareness and lethality for a vehicle of this size and weight.”

Former defence minister Kevin Andrews, ousted in Mr Turnbull’s cabinet reshuffle, tweeted this morning to acknowledge his own role in securing the deal.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999602735042572}",neutral,0.999602735042572,0
