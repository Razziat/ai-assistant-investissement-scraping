"Iridium® NEXT constellation, built by Thales Alenia Space, now completely deployed in orbit - Thales","Wed, 06 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGFsZXNncm91cC5jb20vZW4vd29ybGR3aWRlL3NwYWNlL3ByZXNzLXJlbGVhc2UvaXJpZGl1bXItbmV4dC1jb25zdGVsbGF0aW9uLWJ1aWx0LXRoYWxlcy1hbGVuaWEtc3BhY2Utbm93LWNvbXBsZXRlbHnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"All satellites operational, as project teams rise to a daunting technical challenge

Cannes, February 6, 2019 - The Iridium NEXT constellation of satellites, developed and built by Thales Alenia Space, the joint company between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), leading an industrial consortium, is now fully operational. Following eight successful launches* between January 2017 and January 2019, a total of 75 Iridium NEXT satellites are now fully deployed in low Earth orbit (LEO). More specifically, the constellation operates with 66 satellites at an altitude of about 780 kilometers, distributed in six orbital planes of 11 satellites each, backed by nine in-orbit replacement satellites and six ground spares.

Iridium NEXT: a large-scale program and a human achievement

Iridium NEXT is not only an impressive technical achievement, based on a highly innovative, even novel concept, but above all an industrial and human achievement, for which all of Thales Alenia Space’s European facilities teamed up to meet an inspiring challenge.

Thales Alenia Space is prime contractor for the Iridium NEXT program, responsible for engineering, production, procurement and integration operations, along with the ground and in-orbit testing of the constellation’s overall performance.

The satellite design was refined and tested on two initial models at Thales Alenia Space’s plants in Toulouse and Cannes. Volume production took place at a subcontractor’s premises, the Northrop Grumman Corporation facility in Gilbert, Arizona (formerly Orbital ATK). Satellite integration was performed on site under the direction of a Thales Alenia Space team, specially detached for the purpose. Satellite orbital positioning and in-orbit tests were prepared and executed by Thales Alenia Space teams at Iridium’s Satellite Network Operation Center (SNOC) in Leesburg, Virginia.

A feat of technological prowess, carried off with panache by Thales Alenia Space in partnership with subcontractors and the customer, Iridium Communications

Deliver a series of 81 satellites.

Deploy a complete and complex turnkey system from end to end.

Ensure compatibility between the old and new generations of Iridium satellites without any interruption in user service (Slot Swap**).

Lead an international industrial consortium.

Ensure the in-orbit routing of telecommunications signals.***

Iridium NEXT, the world’s highest performance, most flexible and most sophisticated constellation

The major challenge for Thales Alenia Space was to deploy a complete and complex turnkey system from end to end, while also ensuring compatibility between the old and new generations of Iridium satellites. This is the first time that an operator and a manufacturer have worked hand-in-hand to replace an entire constellation of 66 satellites, one by one, without any interruption in user service**.

The Iridium NEXT constellation represents the state of the art in terms of technology and flexibility. It features global coverage, plus independence from local ground infrastructure due to each satellite being linked to the four closest satellites, in front, behind, to the right and left. No matter where the user is located on land, at sea or in the air, Iridium provides coverage, enabling them to communicate. This type of direct satellite access, whether for transmission or reception, means that reliable communications are available, even in the case of natural disasters or conflicts, in isolated areas, or to provide secure communications with protection against intrusion and piracy***.

Denis Allard, Vice President for Constellation Projects at Thales Alenia Space, said, “Thales Alenia Space is especially proud of having built the Iridium NEXT constellation. We have delivered all 81 satellites in this system, now operational, right on schedule, rising to a challenge that our people met with panache. The success of this complex program further confirms Thales Alenia Space’s global leadership in the constellation market, and also consolidates our unrivaled expertise as prime contractor for complex end-to-end and turnkey communications systems.”

* 75 satellites orbited in 8 launches; 66 now operational in orbit

** Slot Swap

Because these satellites are in low Earth orbit, the Thales Alenia Space teams in Leesburg, Virginia who manage orbital injection and positioning have only 10 minutes of visibility from their ground stations to send commands to the satellites.

Satellite control is then transferred to Iridium teams for Slot Swap operations. This entails ensuring the compatibility between the old and new generations of Iridium satellites without interrupting user service – a daunting feat, especially given how close the old and new satellites are to each other.

Each Iridium NEXT satellite is fitted with a star sensor from Leonardo, used to accurately determine and control its orbit.

*** Routing signals in orbit

Each satellite is linked to the four closest satellites, in front/behind/left/right, which makes the service totally independent from the need for any local ground infrastructure.

This in-orbit routing capability, all software managed, is handled by an onboard processor (OBP) and a platform computer (PFC), along with associated software – the most complex software used on constellation satellites to date.

All of this software can be uploaded from the ground, meaning that updates can be loaded whenever needed, as well as higher-performance versions that will enable Iridium to enhance its customer service offering.

Thales on how AI is making small but meaningful impacts in aviation - Runway Girl Network,"Thu, 07 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTkvMDIvdGhhbGVzLW9uLWhvdy1haS1pcy1tYWtpbmctc21hbGwtYnV0LW1lYW5pbmdmdWwtaW1wYWN0cy1pbi1hdmlhdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"At a Thales-hosted event in Montreal, the French multinational company shared its vision for the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in aerospace. CEO Patrice Caine said the company has invested over €4 billion in digital technologies, including AI. And AI is already making small impacts in the industry, but in ways that airline passengers are unlikely to see or even recognize.

The Thales approach to AI use is not to let machines do all of the thinking, but to keep human involvement at the center of critical decisions. Planes are already highly capable of controlling most aspects of flight. But are pilotless commercial flights around the corner? At this point, that idea is still a pipe dream, according to Thales management (though Thales is putting some of the building blocks in place should autonomous commercial flight become a reality).

There may come a time where commercial aircraft are controlled by both a human pilot and an AI-driven robot. But the situation is a bit of a catch-22. The ability to simply reduce the number of human pilots with AI would help alleviate the worldwide pilot shortage. But controlling a commercial aircraft for several hours without other direct human interaction could easily lead to boredom and/or complacency. Moreover, a number of pilots have suffered debilitating health abnormalities while aloft, including death. The question of what happens when the human pilot becomes incapacitated remains unanswered.

The implementation of AI in its current state is often unseen, but Thales has been using it in the realm of human performance monitoring. Because accidents are often related to pilot error, Thales has begun using AI to track pilot behavior during flight simulator sessions, recording eye movement and how much time the pilots spend performing tasks such as navigation. These findings can help the company find ways to make its avionics more intuitive and helpful to pilots.

In the cabin, Thales said AI can be applied to personalize the passenger experience. The company will be launching its Inflyt 360 platform this year, with an undisclosed customer, beginning with targeted advertising. “Today, the way the airlines advertise, they really do not have an understanding of the behavior of the passengers and we’re aiming to change that,” said Peter Hong, partnership development manager at Thales InFlyt Experience. The product, first announced at AIX 2017, will allow airlines to advertise to individual passengers based on their age, gender, frequent flyer status, cabin class, and destination.

The AI part of Inflyt 360 is an inventory forecast tool, which helps both track and predict the number of impressions made by the advertisements. In 2020, Thales plans to roll out a content recommendation engine, in what the company said will be a Netflix-like experience.

Thales is not alone in its efforts. The Airline Passenger Experience Association (APEX) has formed an Airline Advertising and Ancillary Revenue (ARC) committee, of which Thales is a member. The group aims to accommodate new technical requirements to certify ad impression reporting systems.

APEX chief executive officer Dr. Joe Leader is a big believer in leveraging predictive artificial intelligence to improve the airline passenger experience, saying in a statement today that the next steps for the technology will be to enable hyperpersonalization via inflight entertainment.

Thales seems to understand the burden of the tasks it wishes to accomplish and during the Montreal briefing, it said the company is working to establish an ethics charter, focused on trust, vigilance, and governance.

Caine said AI is seen as a “black box” insofar as the company believes it is imperative to be able to understand why the machine did its action or made its decision. During a panel discussion with Caine, computer scientist Yoshua Bengio said, “Current AI systems are really, really stupid. Their understanding of the world is very superficial. The machine is not god-like. It’s not even human-like. I wouldn’t wait for AI to save us.” Indeed, Thales calls the AI we know today, “weak AI”.

Thales strategy director flight avionics Vincent Megaides believes we face an “upheaval” in the future, with up to 50,000 commercial aircraft in the worldwide fleet, tens of thousands of flying taxis, and freight or surveillance drones. Caine said AI can play an assistive role with air traffic control, monitoring the burden of these new players.

It is difficult to fathom the insertion of so many more aircraft into already crowded airspace over places like New York City. Megaides said, “There must be automation for this to happen.” With the painfully slow implementation of the FAA’s NextGen program, it is easy to be skeptical of the anticipated upheaval in the future.

Years of studies and testing have led to a series contract between Thales and Defence Materiel Organisation (DMO), in which 9 radar systems will be delivered to the Royal Netherlands Army. This contract was signed on 11 February, 2019.

Every second is critical during a mission. Therefore, extreme fast and flexible radar deployment, for observing all kind of hostile activities and actions, are of vital importance. The MMR, meeting all todays requirements for modern warfare, will be the new eyes of the Dutch armed forces. The MMR sees and records everything from RAM, UAV/UAS, aircraft, helicopters and cruise missiles easily and in real-time. Because of its simplicity and high degree of automation, the MMR is a time saver. From its first introduction during training, at the installation on any type of vehicle as well as during its operational deployment and use. The MMR is deployable and ready for use within a couple of minutes, which makes the MMR system one of the most advanced systems in the market. The MMR is the latest version of the Thales 4D AESA radar family, like the NS100 / NS200 / SM400 / SMART-L MM and it is developed for applications on the ground domain.

A unique collaboration

Thanks to the unique collaboration with RNLA, DMO and the industry, this cutting edge solution fits seamlessly with the ideas and wishes of the users. As the name implies, the MMR can be used for multiple missions. By using the most modern technologies, the radar system is very mobile, transportable and fully automatic capable of detecting, tracking and classifying a wide variety of air targets.

The MMR is internationally marketed as GM200 MM/Compact, as a part of the Ground Master 200 family. The MMR makes a wide range of operational missions possible, ranging from air surveillance to weapon locating. In the role of ‘counter battery’ the MMR can distinguish the individual tracks in a salvo firing. The MMR is a “software defined” system, advanced, and future-proof. The system keeps pace with changes in missions and threats.

Lieutenant General L.J.A. (Leo) Beulen, Commander of the Royal Netherlands Army; “Due to its unique true multi mission capability, the MMR will not only set the conditions for winning battles at long range by accurate target acquisition, the MMR will also enhance the RNLA Air Defence capability by addressing the evolving air threat, including Rocket, Artillery and Mortar and Unmanned Air Systems.”

‘’The Netherlands has a leading position in the field of radar development. Therefore, the ‘Nederland Radarland’ platform was established in 2002. This project is a perfect example of the results of this platform. The unique and long lasting cooperation between the Military experts of the Royal Netherlands Army and Thales has led to an extreme modern multi-mission solution, ready for todays’ and tomorrows’ threats.‘’ Geert van der Molen, VP Naval, Thales Netherlands.

Madrid, February 25, 2019 - The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has awarded Thales Alenia Space two contracts concerning the delivery of the Transponders and the Travelling Wave Tube Amplifiers for the Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) and Wide Field InfraRed Survey Telescope (WFIRST) missions.

PACE is a strategic continuity mission, sponsored by NASA’s Earth Science Division, responding to the challenge of climate and environmental change. Planned for a launch in 2022-2023, the PACE satellite will be capable of collecting radiometric and polarimetric measurements of the ocean and atmosphere, from which ocean ecological, ocean biogeochemical, cloud and aerosol particle data will be determined. The PACE observatory is comprised of three instruments: the Ocean Color Instrument (OCI) and two Polarimeters (HARP2 and SPEXOne). It is planned for launch into a Sun synchronous polar orbit at 676.5 km altitude.

Thales Alenia Space @ GSTC 2019 - Thales,"Wed, 13 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbmV3cy90aGFsZXMtYWxlbmlhLXNwYWNlLWdzdGMtMjAxOdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A stakeholder in Singapore’s dynamic performance, Thales Alenia Space will be at the 12th Global Space and Technology Convention (GSTC) on February 14 and 15. The European satellite manufacturer will showcase its latest technologies for very high throughput satellite (VHTS) communications systems, along with its complete range of optical and radar-based spaceborne observation systems. Building on its long experience in low and medium Earth orbit telecom constellations [Thales Alenia Space has built 125 satellites as prime contractor for three constellations], the company will also show visitors how it had already geared up for the transition to the “new space” environment.

A complete range of optical and radar observation systems

Intelligence, maritime surveillance, mapping, crisis management… Space-based systems give users, especially governments, access to a wide range of surveillance and monitoring applications to guarantee their security and sovereignty. A number of countries have indicated a keen interest in acquiring space systems capable of independently supplying them with intelligence images. Thales Alenia Space, the only European company offering both optical and radar very-high-resolution instruments, draws on over 30 years of experience to propose a complete range of observation systems designed to meet market expectations.

In December 2018, Thales Alenia Space won two contracts with South Korea against an international field of competitors, from KAI (Korean Aerospace Industries) and HSC (Hanwha Systems Corporation). It will build four Earth Observation satellites with synthetic aperture radars (SAR) as part of the SmallSat Korea ""425"" project. This system of high-resolution satellites will be used by Korean authorities for intelligence and surveillance applications, including monitoring of zones of specific interest.

VHTS for all!

Because we want to be connected anywhere and at any time; because we want to take advantage at any given moment of increasingly rich content; because no region of the world, especially isolated areas, should be left on the wrong side of the digital divide; because space should deliver solutions to improve people’s lives… Satellite systems, especially the latest digital models, are indubitably the most appropriate solution to address the requirements of the fast-changing and highly competitive telecom market. Furthermore, we are seeing the emergence of new markets, especially aeronautical and maritime, driving a boom in connectivity requirements. The VHTS solution spearheaded by Thales Alenia Space is digital, and therefore offers tremendous agility. This type of system was first seen in military telecom applications, and then more recently transitioned to the commercial market. Today, it’s naturally the preferred solution for operators. Digital VHTS systems combine high capacity, agility and competitiveness. Because of their flexibility, VHTS solutions allow operators to adapt the distribution of throughput across their coverage zone at any given moment. In other words, this type of payload addresses the changing needs of operators throughout a typical satcom mission.

Timely solutions for New Space

NorthStar, BlackSky, KINEIS… In recent years Thales Alenia Space has offered innovative yet competitive proposals for a wide range of activities.

For instance, Thales Alenia Space and the American startup Spaceflight Industries created Leostella LCC, an equally-owned joint venture fully reflecting the needs of the New Space environment. Their aim is to deploy the first constellation featuring short revisit times, comprising 60 optical high-resolution satellites. The first two satellites are already operating in orbit.

Thales Alenia Space will also build Kineis, a constellation of 20 nano-satellites dedicated to The Internet of Things, produced in conjunction with Nexeya for CLS.

The Space Alliance (between Thales Alenia Space and Telespazio) recently acquired a stake in NorthStar Earth & Space Inc, an information services company from Montréal that is developing the world’s most sophisticated system for the surveillance of our environment and near space. Through this investment, the Space Alliance will provide NorthStar with design, development and production solutions for an innovative constellation of 40 satellites.

From its complete range of optical and radar observation systems, to VHTS telecom systems and New Space solutions, Thales Alenia Space covers all the bases at the GSTC space convention in Singapore.

Artificial intelligence for the autonomous trams - Thales,"Fri, 15 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9nZXJtYW55L25ld3MvYXJ0aWZpY2lhbC1pbnRlbGxpZ2VuY2UtYXV0b25vbW91cy10cmFtc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Artificial intelligence for the autonomous trams Share this article

Autonomous train project in partner with Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft in Karlsruhe is one of the most complete projects seen in terms of challenges (time, complexity, innovation, result, etc.) but also diversity in terms of technology. But before focusing on the technology and the solution, it is important to explain the operational use case which leads to the technical solution.

Initially, we focused on the optimization of current processes and therefore the first phase was targeting a use case related to the depot management. First of all today, the driver needs to park the train in the depot at night after the shift, where in peak times the trains queue up and a driver can lose up to 45 minutes. The second tasks are the nightly routines such as maintenance and cleaning performed by the maintenance guys where they lose a lot of time by shunting the trains. These different tasks are automatically and continuously impacting the performance of the different staff.

There would be a huge process optimization and efficiency increase if the train would park themselves autonomously and perform later night the routine jobs after a full day operation with grade of automation level 3 (GoA3). This would avoid using high skilled maintenance engineers for shunting activities and let them focus on the advance tasks they need to perform for maintaining the trains.

In Mid-December 2018, the first trials in GoA3 in the Karlsruhe depot were successfully performed confirming Thales capabilities and technologies being real assets in order to deliver quicker and to help our customer to improve their railway network.

Automatic versus autonomous

The automatic metros or the sky trains in airports are famous for their driverless capabilities. However these solutions are automatic trains and not autonomous trains. Automatic trains are performing in a closed environment, therefore no external events are disturbing the operation. Contrarily to automatic trains, autonomous trains are operating in an open or semi-open environment and unplanned events may occur; the train needs to react to this kind of unknown situations. This is where we come to the question of how the autonomous train can continuously be aware of the surrounding situation? The answer is to make the trains more intelligent and to equip them with the appropriate senses to enable real time awareness.

There are different types of senses for railway: near range, mid-range and/or long-range sensors. These types of sensors are selected according to different parameters, but the main factor remains the speed of the train which indicates the braking distance for the train to stop and which results in the sensor’s performance of detection range. In the mid and long range, we can see the limit of the automotive industry sensors. This is where other industries like defence and avionics can play a significant role for such solutions.

Thales group is positioned as a unique leader in various technologies provided by the diversity of divisions and products, for example, sensors and obstacle detection from our defence and optronic business units, safe and precise satellite positioning from our space and avionics division as well as cyber security from the security sector. Of course all these technologies apply to the state-of-the-art safety from the ground transportations sector. This technology diversity helps Thales to get quicker to the point and reach a minimum viable product rapidly with a high end and premium user experience, by applying new methods of development and agility boosted by the Thales digital factory. The Robot train (RailBot™) is one of the most safe advance technologies in the world of mobility.

Detection, Monitor and Identify

One of the big challenges in railway is to find the right balance between safety and availability, but in fact there is none. If the train is stopping all the time in case of a false detection, the availability of the railway service would be in danger.

One very important aspect in the autonomous train is to bring a reliable vision capability to the train; this capability is here to safely detect obstacles in front of the train but also to monitor the environment around the track.

In order to have an efficient solution we need to differentiate between the different levels of visions; the first one is detection, followed by recognition and finally the obstacle identification.

It is crucial to differentiate between just detecting, recognizing and identifying an obstacle. The first one helps to anticipate and then focus on that specific area in order to classify the category of the obstacle.

If for example there is a detected object but this object is not harmful to the train (e.g. plastic bag, box, etc.), the reaction of the train will be different than if there is a tree or a truck blocking the route of the train.

Here, Artificial Intelligence comes into the game, where deep learning plays a huge role to learn about the type of obstacles the train is facing, and how dangerous it is according to the speed, weather condition and layout of the track.

In this use case, there are three different levels of artificial intelligence:

the first one is to detect the type of obstacle (car, truck, person, staff, tree, bicycle, etc…), the second to detect the intention of the object, if it is a static object or a moving object, entering or leaving the track. The third level deals more with the decision and action the train should take (emergency brake, deceleration, acceleration, honking, etc…).

These with AI advanced sensors will bring the train industry to the next level of operational availability, as RailBot™ will see much further obstacles, in bad weather conditions, as well in low light conditions, and also will anticipate situations which could not be done before.

There is a conviction that with autonomy we can help the railway to have a better position in global mobility, and therefore a better and more flexible mobility for the passengers.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998860359191895}",neutral,0.9998860359191895,0

February 7, 2019 – The four latest O3b satellites arrived at the Guiana Space Center in French Guiana on February 2, after being shipped from Thales Alenia Space’s facility in Rome. Built by Thales Alenia Space as prime contractor for SES, these communications satellites will be launched by a Soyuz rocket in March 2019, joining the current constellation of 16 satellites. The O3b system has been operational in orbit since 2014.

With the four latest satellites up and running in medium Earth orbit (MEO), the O3b constellation will offer greater capacity, better coverage and more efficient operation, along with higher reliability. SES Networks, SES’ provider of global managed data services, will call on these high-performance satellites to offer communications services to telecommunications, maritime, aeronautical, and energy markets, as well as governments and institutions across the world.

These Ka-band satellites are positioned at an altitude of 8,000 kilometers along the equator, providing low-latency, fibre-like connectivity.

As prime contractor for a total of 125 satellites in three constellations, Globalstar 2 (24), O3b (20) and Iridium® NEXT (81), Thales Alenia Space is clearly the benchmark partner in the development and deployment of low and medium orbit telecom satellite constellations.

Preparing the new frigates of the Royal Netherlands Navy for the future with Thales - EDR Magazine,"Thu, 28 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmV1L3ByZXBhcmluZy10aGUtbmV3LWZyaWdhdGVzLW9mLXRoZS1yb3lhbC1uZXRoZXJsYW5kcy1uYXZ5LWZvci10aGUtZnV0dXJlLXdpdGgtdGhhbGVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris-La Défense, 28th February 2019 – The Netherlands Defence Materiel Organisation (DMO) and Thales are developing the Above Water Warfare System (AWWS) for the Royal Netherlands Navy, the first implementation of which will take place on the next generation of its multi-purpose frigates. The M-frigates will be replaced in cooperation with the Belgian Navy. AWWS will protect the Navy against evolving future threats. Vice-Admiral Arie-Jan de Waard, Director of DMO and Gerben Edelijn, CEO of Thales Nederland B.V., are proud of this important step in their cooperation for the future of the Royal Netherlands Navy.

The current multi-purpose frigates in service of the Royal Netherlands Navy and the Belgian Navy are reaching the end of their lifecycle. The next generation will replace these two Dutch and two Belgian M-frigates as of 2024. Although their primary role will be anti-submarine warfare, the new frigates must be able to independently defend themselves as well as nearby units against air and surface threats. For this purpose, they will be equipped with a state-of-the-art surface warfare fire control system, called AWWS.

The development of AWWS has become necessary because above-water threats are growing exponentially in terms of complexity, coordination and speed. Missiles go up to three times faster than the speed of sound, and possibly even up to five times faster in 2020. Currently used technologies are insufficient to make use of all the new sensor and weapon systems to counter these threats in the future. This new system continuously generates the best solution to counter any incoming threats, whatever the environmental conditions or threat complexity. The system will support the operator in making the right decision at every decisive moment.

When faced with scenarios of several different threats arriving simultaneously and employing complex behaviours, such as very high speed, a human operator will no longer be able to schedule and plan the right defensive priorities effectively and efficiently. However, AWWS will offer the operator information to make the right decisions within seconds, so the ship can protect itself successfully and continue on its mission.

AWWS will consist of a new generation of sensors, coupled with intelligent software that continuously calculates which actions are best suited to tackle each threat detected by radar and other sensors in the right manner. This maximizes the chance of survival, while the crew stays in control.

Smart combination of sensors

This system uses the latest sensor technology from Thales to detect and monitor all above-water threats, including the next-generation, fully digital dual-band X/S radar suite: an integral combination of Active Phased Array Radar (APAR) and Sea Master 400 radar technologies.

Prior to the AWWS contract, the Dutch Ministry of Defence initiated advanced research into this technology with DMO, TNO and Thales more than ten years ago. This resulted in an agreement for a “technology demonstrator”. The technology demonstrator will eventually be installed at a shore-based test site for tests and trials.

“For many decades, the naval building cluster, knowledge institutes and Defence have been supplying modern and technologically advanced products in what we call the Triple Helix. These products are essential for our national security. The Triple Helix is therefore a priority technology area in our new Defence Industry Strategy. It is great we are taking an important step for this priority with the development of the AWWS project with Thales” Arie-Jan de Waard, Director, DMO

“Thales has been a supplier for the Royal Netherlands Navy for almost 100 years. We have developed multiple systems in collaboration with the Royal Netherlands Navy in the past. I am proud that we can contribute to the Dutch Navy through the AWWS contract. Together, we can set the new standard for the rest of the world. This development will also strengthen the opportunities of the Dutch Industry in the big development programs in Europe and beyond.” Gerben Edelijn, CEO, Thales Nederland B.V.

What's Really Disrupting Business? It's Not Technology - HBS Working Knowledge - Harvard Business School Working Knowledge,"Mon, 18 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vaGJzd2suaGJzLmVkdS9pdGVtL3doYXQtcy1yZWFsbHktZGlzcnVwdGluZy1idXNpbmVzcy1pdC1zLW5vdC10ZWNobm9sb2d50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"If women wanted to shake up their makeup regimen 10 years ago, Sephora was the place to go. Beauty product junkies loved Sephora’s candy store-like display of sample-size face creams, glittery lip glosses, and eyeshadows in every shade imaginable, allowing them to test out new products at non-committal prices.

That is, until Birchbox came along in 2010 with an innovative offer: Pay a monthly fee and receive a curated box of beauty samples by mail.

“They said, ‘We're going to start off doing this one part of the customer value chain, which is helping you identify the better products, and we're going to do it more conveniently,’” says Thales S. Teixeira, author of the new book Unlocking the Customer Value Chain: How Decoupling Drives Consumer Disruption, which debuts tomorrow.

“Incumbents tend to respond to decoupling by gluing back the part of the value chain that was broken.”

Many established companies lament the disruption they’re facing at the hand of technologically savvy startups. But Teixeira, the Lumry Family Associate Professor of Business Administration, argues that these newcomers simply spotted and served an emerging customer need faster, taking market share from established companies that didn’t see them coming.

Are companies looking at disruption the wrong way?

Danielle Kost: In your book, you argue that technology isn’t the main force hobbling many companies today—it’s changing customer needs and behavior. How did you come to this conclusion?

Thales Teixeira: When I started eight years ago looking into what was going on in certain industries, what came out initially was this idea that it was technology, right? We all talked about Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple. But in many industries, both the disrupter and the disrupted had similar technologies and similar amounts of technology.

The common pattern was that the majority of customers in those markets had changing needs and wants, and their behavior was changing.

Kost: Many of the companies you’ve studied gained a foothold in the market by capturing one piece of the customer value chain, or by following the steps a customer takes to select, buy, and consume a product or service. You call these situations “decoupling.” Could you give an example?

Teixeira: A great example of decoupling is an insurance startup called Trov. It’s an app that allows you to quickly insure expensive belongings for short periods of time. If you're traveling to Rio de Janeiro next week and you just bought a $700 camera that you fear you’ll lose, you can upload some information about the camera to the Trov app, swipe right, and insure it from the moment you embark. One week later, when you come back, you can swipe left and it will stop insuring it.

You don't have to do all the activities you normally would do with a traditional insurance company. You don't have to talk to an agent, look at the policies, list the things you own, pay for the policy, use it, and then cancel it.

[Most] insurance companies don't want to sell you one week of insurance for one product. They have thousands of employees, big budgets, and huge infrastructures, so that they can offer more or all of the activities in the customer value chain.

Kost: Incumbents that survive disruption often embrace it and change their business models to forge new sales channels, revenue streams, and customer segments. Could you give an example?

Teixeira: Incumbents tend to respond to decoupling by gluing back the part of the value chain that was broken. The other alternative is you just live with the fact that it's broken. That's called “preemptively decoupling.” Instead of waiting to be disrupted, you just break it.

When Amazon started selling electronics online, it created apps that encouraged customers to go to a store and check out the prices and products, but order them at Amazon. This is called showrooming.

Best Buy initially tried to prevent customers from showrooming. They considered changing the barcodes on products to make them hard to search for online. The company even tried to use signal jammers, like the ones they use to keep prison inmates from using cell phones.

Eventually Best Buy executives realized that Amazon and showrooming are not going away. They decided to charge manufacturers for putting those items on the shelf. When a company like Samsung puts TVs on display at Best Buy, Samsung is benefiting whether you buy it from Best Buy or Amazon. So Best Buy decided to charge for that value they create.

Kost: Many companies obsess about their direct competitors—how to undercut their prices, outpace them in R&D, or steal their talent. You argue that companies should focus on customers and meeting their needs. Why is that so hard?

Teixeira: You have few competitors, so it's easy to look at what they're doing and emulate or respond. When Coca-Cola launches a new product or reduces prices, it's easy for Pepsi to identify that. It's easy to go to the board or to your boss and say, “Our competitor is doing this. We should respond.”

It’s very hard to understand your customers because you might have millions of them scattered around the world. It's hard to see what they're doing and to understand why they are doing what they're doing.

""In most cases, consumers are disrupting markets, not startups and not technology.""

Kost: So many executives are trying to predict the next wave of disruption. You recommend that executives look for early signs of behavior change in seven consumer categories. Why?

Teixeira: When I started doing this research, I realized that 90 to 97 percent of consumer spending is concentrated in seven categories. I call them the categories that better consumers, from their point of view: where they live, what they eat, what they wear, how they move, how they heal themselves, how they educate themselves, and how they entertain themselves.

When consumers change their behavior, the first signs can be seen in one of these seven industries, and it quickly multiplies.

Kost: What lessons do you hope executives will take from your book?

Teixeira: That the game has changed. In the past, there were a few big companies competing with each other. Coke versus Pepsi. Airbus versus Boeing. GE and Siemens. Now there are thousands of startups in any market, and they're competing with the big companies without having the resources.

But in most cases, consumers are disrupting markets, not startups and not technology. Your way out as a business executive requires adapting and evolving your business model.

Book Excerpt

Layers of Innovation

From: Unlocking the Customer Value Chain

By Thales S. Teixeira

As an advisor to incumbents and startups, I’ve had a chance to watch many entrepreneurs in action and to follow their thinking as it has evolved. Some entrepreneurs conceptualize their new business model all at once, in a single, grand epiphany. They proceed intuitively, rather than methodically.

Twitch’s founders are a good example. They began with a single, “big” idea—allowing people to live-cast on the internet their day-to-day activities—that was centered on technology. After many twists and turns, they arrived at their eventual business model of allowing gamers to decouple playing games from the activity of viewing top players playing them.

Other entrepreneurs are more deliberate than this, beginning by analyzing the existing model in their industry and then layering their own innovation on top. But they still proceed largely by feeling their way, reacting opportunistically to circumstances as they arise.

What if entrepreneurs could proceed far more methodically? What might that look like? In my years of working with entrepreneurs who are building businesses from scratch, and executives rebuilding existing businesses, I’ve developed a way of thinking that is more deliberate, and hence replicable. I typically recommend that entrepreneurs or executives embrace the customer’s vantage point and organize their thinking in terms of three layers.

The first layer is to articulate the current or standard business model. After all, most startups need to pull customers away from existing businesses or activities (e.g., dry cleaning versus do-it-yourself clothes washing). Customers evaluate the startup in comparison to what they already have. If you want to thoroughly understand a new business idea, you must take the current reality as your foundation.

The second layer is to develop the digital equivalent of the standard model. Almost all young entrepreneurs I meet today incorporate the internet into their business ideas. When comparing their innovative products to the best options that are currently available, the less elaborate ideas tend to focus on simply translating or “porting” a traditional business model onto the internet.

As an example, homeowners traditionally hire housekeepers, gardeners, and others to help with common household chores. TaskRabbit, the digital equivalent, lets you hire people, but do so over the web. Likewise, the startup company Washio created a mobile app that allowed you to request digitally that your dry cleaning be picked up and delivered, saving you the trouble of going to the dry cleaner’s yourself.

With this digital equivalent layered on top of the standard business model, the third and final layer for entrepreneurs and executives is to determine how to innovate on top of digital business models.

Some entrepreneurs I’ve met understand that the mere porting of a business model online isn’t enough. It might benefit users, but it creates downsides, too.

TaskRabbit accelerates the process of choosing people to perform chores for you, but it’s also riskier, since it requires that you allow complete strangers inside your home. Washio offered convenience, but at a price.

Considering the benefits and costs, smart entrepreneurs try to layer on top of their digital business idea an innovation that transcends mere digitization, and that produces a functional benefit for customers.

Founders of Hello Alfred innovated upon the TaskRabbit model by outsourcing the management of TaskRabbit workers to personally assigned butlers, or “Al- freds.” For users, the presence of a butler on the scene allowed for a more trustworthy and reliable service.

Many of the entrepreneurs I’ve worked with find that this three-part structure allows them to distinguish clearly between the novel and non-novel aspects of their business idea. It also forces the more intuitive thinkers to articulate, test, and validate their assumptions, rather than to just plop an idea out on the table and have others react to it.

Finally, the format clarifies for all interested parties—including advisors, investors, and employees—the incremental value of the proposed business idea relative to the traditional approach.

Further, it reveals the hidden assumptions, as well as the incremental value, of any innovative technologies and business model components being proposed.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998015761375427}",neutral,0.9998015761375427,0

The Agency for Aerial Navigation Safety in Africa and Madagascar is an air traffic control agency based in Dakar, Senegal. It manages 16.1 million square kilometres of airspace (1.5 times the size of Europe) covering six Flight Information Regions (FIRs) – Antananarivo, Brazzaville, Dakar Oceanic and Terrestrial, Niamey and N’Djamena. ASECNA Air Traffic Control centres are based at international airports in each of these cities.

According to Article 2 of the Dakar Convention, this agency is responsible for the design, implementation and management of facilities and services relating to the transmission of technical information and traffic, aircraft guidance, air traffic control, flight information, forecasting and reporting to the meteorological department, about traffic routes when it comes to approaching and landing on Community airports.

NIGCOMSAT deploys Africa’s first Satellite Based Augmentation Systems

Starting in 2021-22, these services aim to improve the positioning performance of existing satellite navigation systems, such as Global Positioning System (GPS) or Galileo. The new system will help improve precision (down to within a meter), integrity, availability, and continuity for safety-related applications. Other business sectors, including maritime, rail and road transport, as well as agriculture, could benefit from these services.

The phase B study should enable countries belonging to ASECNA to define the best system architecture to support the delivery of SBAS services, and to ensure transparency during the following development, deployment and operational phases. The study is being financed by a grant from the EU-Africa Infrastructure Trust Fund (EU-AITF), through a financing agreement with the French Development Agency (AFD). The European Commission and European Global Navigation Satellite System Agency (GSA) will provide technical assistance as part of an international agreement between ASECNA and the European Union (EU), also including the French Space Agency (CNES).

This is coming about 2 months after Thales Alenia Space signed a Cooperative Agreement with NIGCOMSAT on SBAS Test bed Demonstration to characterize and validate the performance of NIGCOMSAT-1R navigation band payload with service trials and thus creating a common technical stream for a unified and holistic SBAS infrastructure to fill up the hiatus in Augmentation System for African continent and surrounding oceans (Atlantic and Indian).","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.5854478478431702}",positive,0.5854478478431702,1
Entrust to Acquire Hardware Security Module Maker nCipher - SecurityWeek,"Fri, 22 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlY3VyaXR5d2Vlay5jb20vZW50cnVzdC1hY3F1aXJlLWhhcmR3YXJlLXNlY3VyaXR5LW1vZHVsZS1tYWtlci1uY2lwaGVyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Entrust Datacard and Thales have signed a definitive agreement for Entrust to acquire the nCipher general purpose hardware security module (GP HSM) division of Thales. Financial details have not been disclosed.

nCipher became a separate stand-alone business within Thales on January 7, 2019. This was done as a requirement of the European Union before it would allow completion of Thales’ purchase of Gemalto (also an HSM manufacturer). The intention was that nCipher would operate separately from Thales until such time as a buyer could be found.

It is almost certain that discussion between Thales and Entrust were already well-advanced when SecurityWeek spoke to nCipher in January. Peter Galvin, chief strategy and marketing officer at nCipher Security, told SecurityWeek that he saw new growth in PKI (public key infrastructure) based on the expanding IoT. “PKI has been around for years,” he said, “but companies are now beginning to install systems, and there are new opportunities with IoT. If you start to think about the 20 billion devices that are going to be installed over the next few years, you can protect the authenticity of the devices with a key or certificate associated with them, and you protect communication with and from them with encryption.”

Entrust Datacard offers trusted identity and secure transaction technologies. It has an ioTrust product designed for the deployment of secure PKI-based IoT ecosystems. The purchase of nCipher will expand its offerings to those companies who wish to secure IoT PKI keys locally and securely.

Of course, the advantages of owning and selling its own HSMs goes far beyond IoT alone. The use of encryption generally is growing rapidly in cloud and mobile technologies, and HSMs are the perfect solution to managing crypto keys.

“This acquisition is an excellent complement to our expertise in both cryptography and hardware and will extend our ability to meet the evolving security needs of our customers globally while allowing us to accelerate our own growth,” said Todd Wilkinson, president and CEO of Entrust Datacard.

nCipher’s CEO Cindy Provin agrees. “nCipher Security is delighted to join Entrust Datacard,” she said. “There is a powerful synergy between our solutions and the combination of our organizations will accelerate innovation for our customers as they embark on initiatives such as mobility, cloud and IoT to grow their businesses and simultaneously strive to protect data and manage ever-growing cyber risk.”

For Thales, the sale is not about selling nCipher but about ensuring the purchase of Gemalto. “This announcement marks a key step in the ongoing process regarding the acquisition of Gemalto which we expect to close by end March 2019,” said Philippe Keryer, executive VP, strategy, research and technology at Thales. “We are convinced that nCipher Security will strongly leverage the expertise of Entrust Datacard, an organization focused on their competencies in the development of safe and secure access to information, applications and networks as well as its global presence specifically in Europe and in North America.”

No announcement has been made over the fate of nCipher’s current 300 employees — although it seems likely that the majority will be retained after the sale. “The Thales General Purpose HSM solution, known as nCipher Security, has a strong market position, brings with it exceptional internal talent and offers us the ability to develop even more comprehensive solutions for our clients,î said Wilkinson.

The purchase is not quite guaranteed. “This transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of 2019,” announced Thales. “It addresses commitments made by Thales to several competition authorities to divest this business to a suitable purchaser in order to ensure a strongly competitive market for GP HSM solutions and to finalize the acquisition of Gemalto. The transaction is subject to the successful completion of the acquisition of Gemalto by Thales, the approval of Entrust as a suitable purchaser by the European Commission, US Department of Justice, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and New Zealand Commerce Commission, and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.”

LS2 Report: a technological leap for SPS acceleration - CERN,"Tue, 26 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vaG9tZS5jZXJuL25ld3MvbmV3cy9hY2NlbGVyYXRvcnMvbHMyLXJlcG9ydC10ZWNobm9sb2dpY2FsLWxlYXAtc3BzLWFjY2VsZXJhdGlvbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The SPS radiofrequency acceleration system is being enhanced with a new technology: solid-state amplifiers

Big changes are under way at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS). One of the major operations is the upgrade of the machine’s acceleration system. ""The beams in the High-Luminosity LHC will be twice as intense, which requires an increase in radiofrequency power,"" explains Erk Jensen, leader of the Radiofrequency (BE-RF) group. One aspect of the LHC Injectors Upgrade (LIU) project is therefore bringing the SPS acceleration system up to standard.

Erk Jensen shows us around the huge Building 870, just behind the CERN Control Centre on the Prévessin site, which is a hive of activity. Everywhere you look, teams are pulling out cables, unscrewing components and removing electronic modules. Dismantling is one of the main activities of this first phase of the Long Shutdown. No fewer than 400 km of cables are being removed at Points 3 and 5 of the SPS, for example.

In the large halls, we can see the huge power converter and amplifier installations that supply the radiofrequency (RF) accelerator cavities of the SPS. The amplifiers use an electronic tube technology dating back to the 1970s and 80s, as the SPS was commissioned in 1976 and transformed into a proton-antiproton collider in 1981. Two tube systems exist alongside each other, each producing 2 megawatts of power.

To supply the power needed for the High-Luminosity LHC, a team from the RF group, headed by Eric Montesinos, working with the firm Thales Gérac, has developed a new system that uses solid-state amplifiers, similar to those that were recently developed for the SOLEIL and ESRF synchrotrons. The transistors for these amplifiers are assembled in sets of four on modules that supply 2 kilowatts, much less power than was delivered by the electronic tubes (between 35 and 135 kilowatts). But a total of 2560 modules, i.e. 10 240 transistors, will be spread across 32 towers. The power from 16 towers will be combined via an RF power combiner. The whole system will be able to provide RF power of two times 1.6 megawatt to the cavities.

""This system is much more flexible, since the power is distributed across thousands of transistors,"" observes Eric Montesinos. ""If a few transistors stop working, the RF system will not stop completely, whereas if one of the tubes failed, we had to intervene quickly."" In addition, it’s much easier to change a module, especially since electronic tubes in this frequency range are an endangered species, accelerators being among the last applications of the technology.

Development of the solid-state amplifier system began in 2016. A team from the RF group worked in collaboration with scientists from Thales Gérac, and many tests and adjustments had to be carried out. Power electronics are subject to significant thermomechanical effects, so the technique for fitting the transistors onto the plate of the module, to take one example, turned out to be a particularly tricky aspect to get right. After several dozen complex prototypes had been produced, the work finally came to a successful conclusion last year: the first tower housing 80 transistor modules operated for 1000 hours, passing the validation tests in August. This was a great success that allowed series production to begin while the tests continued.

The structures, i.e. the 32 towers, have already been installed in a new room, giving it the air of a science-fiction movie set. Only one of them so far is equipped with its RF power modules, offering a taste of the even more futuristic look that the room will have in a few months’ time. The modules will be delivered as of May, continuing through to the end of the year; all of them will be tested on a specially designed test bench before being installed in the towers. Some painstaking work faces the teams that will install all the modules.

In parallel, the cavities have been removed from the tunnel. The SPS has four 200 MHz cavities: two formed of four sections, and two of five sections, each section measuring four metres. ""To accelerate more intense beams, we need to reduce the length of the cavities in order to maintain a sufficiently strong electromagnetic field along their whole length,"" explains Erk Jensen. The teams will therefore reassemble the sections in order to form a total of six cavities: two of four sections and four of three sections.

At the same time, the beam control system is being replaced. The Faraday cage, which houses the electronic racks for the beam control system, has been completely emptied, ready to be fitted with the latest electronics and new infrastructure (lighting, cooling and ventilation systems, among others). Finally, an improved system for eliminating parasitic resonances will be installed, based on HOM (higher order mode) couplers, which were tested during the last run.

The teams must stick to a tight schedule, comprising all the dismantling work, the start of installation later in 2019, and numerous tests and commissioning tasks in 2020.

Entrust Datacard CEO: Thales' nCipher Acquisition Powered by Quandts - Tech Monitor,"Thu, 28 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaG1vbml0b3IuYWkvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9jbG91ZC9lbnRydXN0LWRhdGFjYXJkLWNlb9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Entrust Datacard’s agreement to buy the UK’s nCipher Security from defence and aerospace multinational Thales is part of the company owner’s “generational wealth-building” approach, CEO Todd Wilkinson told Computer Business Review in a call this week.

US-based Entrust itself was bought by the billionaire German Quandt family’s Datacard Group for a reported $500 million (Bloomberg estimate) in 2013.

Backed by the family’s significant firepower – the family is one of Germany’s richest and a major BMW shareholder – the company has made a string of European acquisitions in the past 12 months, with nCipher just the latest British company to prove an attractive target.

Rationale for the Deal

Entrust Datacard CEO Todd Wilkinson said: “We are a leader in SSL certificate offerings, in PKI certificates. when you look at Cindy’s business in nCipher one of the most common uses for HSMs is alongside PKI; we see significant synergies. We have a very similar customer base. The combination of our sales teams and technology teams is going to give us both some scale and capabilities that we didn’t have individually. I’m excited about bringing these business together. ”

Cambridge-based nCipher, a hardware security module (HSM) specialist owned by Thales, is being sold as part of a deal with regulators. The European Commission had asked Thales to offload the asset in order to ensure the HSM market remains competitive following Thales’ pending acquisition of Gemalto.

nCipher Security CEO Cindy Provin told Computer Business Review in a call: “We did have a number of bidders, but the entire team is very optimistic about working with Entrust Datacard. From a management perspective they were our preferred option. We’re just working on some final carve-out activities like purging of data, ring-fencing of some assets but in terms of the finishing activities we’re on track to close in the second half of 2019. We see tremendous growth opportunities to cross-sell and up-sell.”

Seven months earlier Entrust also made a strategic investment in the UK’s CensorNet, which provides a cloud access security broker (CASB) offering, multi-factor authentication, and web and email security.

The company also bought Copenhagen-based SMS Passcode, CensorNet’s adaptive multi-factor authentication technology solutions provider, at the same time saying: “At a time when other security players are going through large, complex mergers or acquiring and shelving smaller innovators, Entrust Datacard is building strong partnerships through targeted investments and acquisitions.”

With regard to the nCipher acquisition, Entrust CEO Todd Wilkinson told Computer Business Review: “This is a definite agreement… we are still working to complete some regulatory clearances. Bit one of the reasons that we were chosen was our ability to overcome those regulatory steps. It’s two businesses coming together support growth in all regions.”

Asked how the deal was financed – and declining to offer any details on what the company was paying for nCipher – he said: “We have a unique ability to raise equity funding; our owners take a long-term generational wealth-building approach and because of that we can make the investments that make strategic sense.”

Asked if he would be looking to bring nCipher’s team under one roof with an Entrust Datacard team he said: “As we sit today I have a pretty sizable development team in Minneapolis, in Ottawa, in Denver… this will bring in a sizable development team in Cambridge which is another great location with great talent.”

Entrust Datacard: Portfolio Includes PKI Managed Service

Among Entrust Datacard’s offerings are a Microsoft Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

Managed Service.

While its possible to put your public key infrastructure in the cloud, businesses need to maintain sole control of their cryptographic keys. Certificate authority (CA) keys need to be managed properly under policies and auditable processes, as well as stored in hardware security modules (HSMs) like those provided by nCipher Security.

Entrust Datacard achieves this by hosting the offline root CA and HSMs in its certified data centers and by giving a dedicated customer access to root CA keys, without requiring admin rights to the customer’s Active Directory; control over the PKI and its associated business processes remains with the customers.

Further down the line, the challenge of PKI management is one that Microsoft is hoping to circumvent via the development of homomorphic encryption, which lets users compute on data while it is encrypted.

This means users will, as the technology matures, be able to process encrypted data in the cloud, without having to download it for decryption on-premises, or provide a decryption key to a third party provider.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999268054962158}",neutral,0.9999268054962158,0
Sea Naval Solutions details proposal for the Belgian-Dutch MCM Program - Naval News,"Thu, 07 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDE5LzAyL3NlYS1uYXZhbC1zb2x1dGlvbnMtZGV0YWlscy1wcm9wb3NhbC1mb3ItdGhlLWJlbGdpYW4tZHV0Y2gtbWNtLXByb2dyYW0v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Sea Naval Solutions details proposal for the Belgian-Dutch MCM Program As the Belgian-Dutch MCM tender is heating up, the Sea Naval Solutions (SNS) consortium (Thales-Engine Deck Repair-Chantier de l’Atlantique-Socarenam) invited Naval News in Antwerp to detail its proposal and to outline the capabilities of EDR shipyard.

The Belgian and Dutch navies will start replacing their ageing fleet of MCM vessels from 2023. The Tripartite class vessels were built in the 1980s under a trilateral program between Belgium, Netherlands and France. Under the MCM program, the two navies intend to purchase 12 new vessels, 10 “tool boxes” and an initial 10 years support contract. Each tool box will be composed of an array of remotely operated and autonomous platforms, with two unmanned surface vessels (USV), one autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), one unmanned air vehicle (UAV) and, depending on the countries request, one remotely operated vehicle (ROV). Three naval defense joint ventures (called « combinations » by the Belgian military) are competing in this tender: SeaNavalSolutions (Thales, EDR, Chantiers de l’Atlantique and Socarenam); Belgium Naval & Robotics (Naval Group and ECA) and Damen Imtech Belgium.

Based in Antwerp, EDR has 6 dry-docks measuring from 148 meters up to 312 meters in length. EDR has 8,300 m² of storage area for spare parts and consumables of which 5,000 m² covered and 14,000 m² workshop area of which 8,000 m2 covered. Naval News picture.

With a 50 years long history in Belgium, EDR and Thales Belgium are now actively promoting the SNS offer for the MCM program.

SNS has decided to locate the bulk of its industrial activities in Belgium: the platforms will be partly built and then fully equipped by EDR, the combat systems and the counter-mining system will be integrated by Thales in Belgium. Finally, maintenance will be carried out in Zeebrugge, Antwerp, Ostend and Tubize.

SNS guarantees returns worth 2.3 billion Euro (US$2.61Bn) over a period of 20 years. Sea Naval Solutions image.

Through these transfers of knowledge and technologies, SNS guarantees returns worth 2.3 billion Euro (US$2.61Bn) over a period of 20 years, shared at 70% in Flanders and 30% in Brussels and Wallonia. The MCM program will enable SNS to carry out 82 projects, involving some fifty companies (78% of which are SMEs), academies and research centers. Will have a positive impact on more than 500 jobs throughout Belgium.

“These projects with high technological value in the naval field will allow Belgium to rebuild a shipbuilding capacity in Antwerp, and develop new centers of expertise in artificial intelligence, simulation and cyber security”, said SNS.

The first mother ship is to be delivered in 2023, a rythtm that will rise to two ships per year starting 2024. « It will take us 18 months and 130 persons to build a sole mothership », stated SNS. Based on a Chantier de l’Atlantique concept called “Deviceseas” launched during Euronaval 2016, the proposed mother ship is 92 meters long, with a displacement of 3,500 tons. With a complement of 63 sailors, the vessel will carry two surface drones (USV) and up to 8 autonomous underwater systems (AUV and ROV) housed in a dedicated compartment. Close-in protection capability would be provided by a sole Sea deFNder RCWS, a maritime variant of the deFNder Medium turret. It can integrate all FN Herstal machine guns up to .50 caliber, including the FN M3R with high firing rate of 1,100 RPM.

Originally developed for the offshore market, the Launch and recovery system (LARS) is capable of launching and recovering a wide range of vessels with or without crew in sea state 5, on or under water and up to a mass of 20 tonnes.

The systems proposed for the toolbox are based on solutions developed and tested in operational conditions. The subsystems and their evolution have been validated and demonstrated at sea as part of evaluation campaigns in Singapore, France or Japan. They were also part of official demonstrations during UW16, TTCP, North Sea Unmanned Trials 16 and 17, ANTX, etc. The heart of the toolbox has already been validated at sea through the Franco-British MMCM (Maritime Mine Counter Measures) program.

The SNS toolbox offer is to include Thales’ T-SAS towed sonar, as well as the M-AUV. Both will be launched from the French company’s Halcyon USV, whom the composite hull will be party produced in Wallonia by Sobelcomp.

Besides Thales’ solutions, SNS proposal relies on Saab’s know-how to complete its toolbox. According the consortium, the Saab Multi-Shot Mine Neutralisation System (MuMNS) ROV has been selected for disposal missions while the UMS Skeldar (Saab-UMS Aero Group AG) V-200 VTOL UAV should become the preferred UAV platform.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999988079071045}",neutral,0.9999988079071045,0

Thales has developed a new Multi-Mission Radar (MMR) for artillery, 4D air surveillance, air defence, and security applications. The radar was developed in conjunction with operational specialists from the Royal Netherlands Army (RNLA).

A contract between Thales and the Netherlands Defence Materiel Organisation (DMO) will see nine radar systems delivered to the Royal Netherlands Army. The contract was signed on 17 January, 2019.

Every second is critical during a mission. Therefore, extremely fast and flexible radar deployment, for observing all kind of hostile activities and actions, is of vital importance, Thales stated in a press release.

Thales says the MMR sees and records everything from UAV/UAS, aircraft, helicopters and cruise missiles easily and in real-time. By using the most modern technologies, the radar system is very mobile, transportable and capable of detecting, tracking and classifying a wide variety of air targets.

Thanks to the unique collaboration with RNLA, Thales says the solution fits seamlessly with the ideas and wishes of users. As the name implies, the MMR can be used for multiple missions.

The MMR will be nternationally marketed as GM200 MM/Compact, as a part of the Ground Master 200 family. The MMR makes a wide range of operational missions possible, ranging from air surveillance to weapon locating. In the role of 'counter battery,' Thales says the MMR can distinguish the individual tracks in a salvo firing.

Lieutenant General L.J.A. (Leo) Beulen, Commander of the Royal Netherlands Army said: “Due to its unique true multi-mission capability, the MMR will not only set the conditions for winning battles at long range by accurate target acquisition, the MMR will also enhance the RNLA Air Defence capability by addressing the evolving air threat, including rocket, artillery and mortar and Unmanned Air Systems.”

The Netherlands has a leading position in the field of radar development, with the 'Nederland Radarland' naval platform being established in 2002.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995551705360413}",neutral,0.9995551705360413,0

In this interaction with Brig S K Chatterji (Retd), Editor, BharatShakti.in, Mr. Emmanuel de Roquefeuil, VP & Country Director, Thales in India, discusses Thales’ plans for India.

———————————————————————————————————-

through its supply chain partnerships with the local industry

Brig S K Chatterji (Retd) (SKC): Tell us about Thales’ innovative solutions and its endeavors in supporting the modernisation of Indian armed forces.

Emmanuel de Roquefeuil (ER) : Present in India since 1953, Thales has been a reliable partner to the Indian armed forces and is supporting its modernization efforts. Under the government’s ‘Make in India’ policy, the Indian defence and aerospace sector is taking right strides towards becoming a global manufacturing hub. This has opened several new avenues for OEMs like Thales to explore business opportunities and form new relationships with our local partners in India.

As a global technology leader, Thales’ strong innovation capabilities prepare its customers to achieve their big ambitions and master every decisive moment. The company has been on the cutting edge of connectivity and a driving force in the digitalisation of the defence, aerospace and space markets among others. Since 2014, Thales has invested almost €7 billion in digital technologies (AI, Big Data, Cyber Security & IoT), including the under process acquisition of Gemalto.

As India’s digital ecosystem is rapidly developing, there is a huge potential for organisations like Thales to support the needs of the Indian Air Force, Army and Navy with their solutions coupled with key digital technologies.

SKC: What is the purpose of Engineering Competence Centre that you are going to open in Bengaluru?

It will be a first-of-its kind engineering centre in India that will focus on software and hardware capabilities in the areas of civil as well as defence businesses, serving Thales’ global needs. We seek to hire over 2000 engineers in the next three to five years for this Engineering Centre.

SKC: Tell us about Thales equipment being installed on upgraded Mirage 2000 aircraft for the IAF?

ER: The Indian Air Force (IAF) has been integral in safeguarding the country’s sovereignty and securing the Indian airspace, along with other branches of the Indian armed forces. Thales has been committed to supporting them in mastering every decisive moment.

In July 2011, Thales and Dassault Aviation signed a contract for the upgrade of the IAF’s Mirage 2000 fleet, which will enhance its technical-operational capabilities. As a result, the IAF will have a coherent platform-system combination for the next 20 years. The IAF’s air potential will be further enhanced by the integration of new capabilities. These include longer-range detection across the entire spectrum, improved tactical situation awareness, longer-range weapon firing against multiple simultaneous targets, weapon stealth and an extended operating envelope with the capability to engage ground targets whilst countering airborne threats.

SKC: What are the existing partnerships and JVs that Thales has in India?

ER: Thales strategy of developing its industrial footprint in India is in line with the Indian government’s policy of ‘Make in India’ and of developing the defence base of the country. We have been co-operating with the Indian private sector, particularly large corporate players and SMEs, to build transfer of technology and supply chain partnerships in the fields of complex electronics, wired mechanical structures, optronics, complex hardware and software engineering.

We have been working closely with Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) for over 50 years and have been providing high-end avionics to equip the platforms that HAL is designing.

We also have a strong working relationship with Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) with whom we have formed a joint venture (JV) BEL-Thales Systems Limited (BTSL) dedicated to civilian and select ground-based military radars. With BTSL, Thales is jointly developing the PHAROS fire control radar for gun and missile systems that will cater to both domestic Indian and international markets. BTSL will also be undertaking the production of the LBREC – Low Band Receiver of the self-protection suite of the Rafale.

Thales also has JVs with Samtel and L&T Technology Services in the fields of military avionics and airborne sensor systems, and avionics software respectively.

Besides these, Thales and Bharat Dynamics Ltd. (BDL), a Government of India enterprise, signed an MoU in February 2017 to assess the opportunity for the transfer of technology of the STARStreak missile capability to India with the support of the Government of the United Kingdom. In 2018, MKU Limited and Thales signed MoU for strategic co-operation in the development and production of optronic devices.

SKC: What are the futuristic defence technologies that Thales is working on?

ER: From robotics to drones and adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in defence equipment, there are multiple areas of strong innovation in the defence industry. Thales meets its clients’ ambitions through its expertise in four main technologies of the digital revolution. These digital technologies include ‘Connectivity’, ‘Big Data’, ‘Cybersecurity’ and ‘Artificial Intelligence’. It is injecting these disruptive technologies into its solutions across its major markets including defence.

Today, connectivity and connected objects, Big Data, and Artificial Intelligence make for fantastic innovation accelerators, so long as these technologies are developed in a highly secure way. They are at the centre of digital transformation and make Thales a major player in this domain.

SKC: What are the key technologies and products that Thales will be showcasing at Aero India 2019?

ER: At Aero India this year, Thales will showcase its solutions developed in India through its supply chain partnerships with the local industry – supporting the ‘Make in India’ initiative of the government. It will also present the latest advancements in its capabilities that seek to serve the interests of the Indian Air Force and also Ministry of Civil Aviation. Thales stand AB 2.21 will bring alive a range of solutions across aero civil and defence domains through special immersive digital experiences. Some of the demos at the stand will include optronic pod TALIOS, latest generation mini-UAS Spy’Ranger, high velocity missile STARStreak, rockets and a range of radio communication products, among others.

New radar for the army - De Ingenieur,"Tue, 12 Feb 2019 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlaW5nZW5pZXVyLm5sL2FydGlrZWwvbmV3LXJhZGFyLWZvci10aGUtYXJtedIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Royal Netherlands Army can look forward to receiving nine multi-mission radar (MMR) systems from Thales developed entirely in the Netherlands, according to an announcement made on Monday by Thales and the Dutch Defence Equipment Organisation.

Thales Nederland claims that the MMR is one of the most advanced radar systems currently available. According to spokesperson Job van Harmelen, the system can detect and register everything within a radius of 400 km: mortars, drones, planes, helicopters and cruise missiles. It can even distinguish different projectiles in a salvo.



Multi-Mission

The multi-mission feature is new. 'The radar can follow traces of incoming and outgoing ground fire, but also monitor the entire airspace at the same time. Previously, multiple systems were needed to do this.' The system not only sees where mortars are being fired from, it also calculates where they will land, says Van Harmelen.

Another important advantage of the radar system is its rapid preparation time. It can be transported on a trailer, and can be up and running within two minutes. 'It’s almost plug-and-play,' says Van Harmelen. The system requires no levelling, as any misalignment is automatically corrected by the built-in software.

Lieutenant General Leo Beulen, commander of the Royal Netherlands Army, is delighted with the new system. 'The MMR’s unique multi-mission capability means it can go beyond helping to win long-distance battles by accurately identifying targets,' he says in a press release. 'The MMR will also improve the Royal Netherlands Army’s air defence capacity by combating new threats from the air, such as rocket attacks, artillery and mortar, and unmanned aerial systems.'



Nederland Radarland

The MMR is the latest achievement of the Nederland Radarland partnership, which was set up in 2002 to stimulate knowledge, innovation and developments in the field of radar in the Netherlands. As well as Thales and the Ministry of Defence, the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research and Delft University of Technology are members of the partnership. The MMR system, which was developed jointly by Thales and the Royal Netherlands Army, is a refinement of a radar system previously developed for the Royal Netherlands Navy.

'The Netherlands has a leading position in radar development,' says Geert van der Molen, VP Naval at Thales Netherlands and responsible for marine affairs. According to Van der Molen, the MMR is a 'perfect example' of the results of Nederland Radarland. 'The unique, long-term cooperation between the military experts of the Royal Netherlands Army and Thales has led to an extremely modern multi-mission solution, developed for both current and future threats.'

The first MMR will be delivered in 2.5 years. The purchase represents an investment of 100 to 250 million euros, according to a report in Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf.
