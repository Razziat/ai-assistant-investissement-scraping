"ORP ""Orkan"" Fast Attack Craft Missile - Polish Navy - Global Security","Tue, 14 Aug 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdsb2JhbHNlY3VyaXR5Lm9yZy9taWxpdGFyeS93b3JsZC9ldXJvcGUvb3JwLW9ya2FuLmh0bdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ORP ""Orkan"" Fast Attack Craft Missile

Fast Attack Craft Missile (Fast Patrol Boats), ""Orkan"" class (NATO: Sassnitz). Originally intended for the German Democratic Republic, the hulls were built in VEB Peenewerft, Wolgast (former DDR). Three unfinished boats were acquired by the Polish Navy from VEB Peenewerft shipyard after German reunification and equipped in the Northern Shipyard in Gdansk.

In August 2001 the Naval Shipyard Gdynia (Stocznia Marynarki Wojennej) and Thales Nederland B.V. signed a contract worth 76 million euros for the modernisation of the three ORKAN class Fast Attack Craft with the Polish Navy (Marynarki Wojennej RP) and Thales Swedish sub-contractors, Ericsson Microwave System AB and SAAB Bofors Dynamics AB on 31 July, 2001. The ships communications system will be delivered by Thales Naval GmbH, subsidiary of Thales Nederland B.V. in Germany.

The contract covers the delivery and integration of the combat systems on-board the Polish Navys three existing ORKAN class Fast Attack Craft. Thales is world-renowned for its state-of-the-art, fully distributed modular combat systems. Thales Combat Management System (TACTICOS) uses Multi-function Operator Consoles (MOC Mk3) and its own application software. The main characteristic of these systems is the full integration of both the various sensors - including those not supplied by Thales - and a wide range of hard- and soft-kill weapons into an integrated system. STING-EO is included as fire control system and integration of the existing guns is part of the overall project. Besides the combat systems on-board the ORKAN, a Land based Integration and Programming System is included in the contract.

Thales will involve Polish industry in high technology areas of the programme such as interface development and subsystem production. Full transfer of technology to Polish industry will take place progressively during the programme for the Combat System Integration (CSI) activities. The Naval Shipyard Gdynia is supervised by the Polish Ministry of National Defence and is the oldest shipyard in Poland, having served the Polish Navy for 80 years.

Thales Naval Nederlands Commercial Director, Mr. Rob van der Wurff, has expressed his pleasure with the companys first contract in Poland in the naval domain. It is of great significance, especially as Poland is one of the new NATO members. Thales is honored to assist this new member to create an up-to-date and NATO-compatible fleet.

On 06 October 2006 the procurement contract for the heavy-weight Surface-to-Surface Missile System RBS15 Mk3 was signed by Saab Bofors Dynamics and the Polish companies MESKO and BUMAR. MESKO and BUMAR are procuring the RBS15 Mk3 on behalf of the Polish Ministry of Defence. The value of the contract for Saab Bofors Dynamics is M 110. Poland is the 2nd NATO-nation to order the new generation RBS15 Mk3. Germany placed an order with the prime contractor Diehl BGT Defence in September 2005. The Polish Navy is going through a major transformation in order to adapt to the new requirements of the future and the acquisition of the RBS15 Mk3 system is a very important milestone in this process, says Fleet Admiral Roman Krzyzelewski, Commander in chief of the Polish Navy.

The ordered missiles will arm Polands ORKAN-class corvettes, which are currently under modernisation. This contract is follow-on to the ship integration contract signed in 2001 with Thales Naval Netherlands for the supply of ship equipment. The RBS15 Mk3 is the latest generation, long range, Surface-to-Surface Missile (SSM) system. The system is excellent as main anti surface armament for any type of naval vessel. RBS15 Mk3 is extremely resistant to countermeasures, providing high penetration capability against air defences with guided and tube weapons. The launch customers include the German Navy as well as Poland which is equipping its ORKAN class speedboats with RBS15 Mk3 missiles. The delivery of the first missiles began in March 2011. The long-range, all-weather capable Fire-and-Forget missile tracks its target directly above the water surface over distances of more than 200 km. By means of programmed way points, the missile´s trajectory and flight altitude can be altered several times.

In Brief: New Frigates of the Netherlands and Singapore | Center for International Maritime Security - CIMSEC,"Thu, 09 Aug 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vY2ltc2VjLm9yZy9pbi1icmllZi1uZXctZnJpZ2F0ZXMtb2YtdGhlLW5ldGhlcmxhbmRzLWFuZC1zaW5nYXBvcmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"By N.R. Jenzen-Jones

The Netherlands’ De Zeven Provinciën Class

HNLMS Evertsen is one of four De Zeven Provinciën class air defence and command frigates in service with the Royal Netherlands Navy (Koninklijke Marine). Evertsen is the youngest of the four, having been completed in 2003 and commissioned in 2005. These ships superseded the two smaller Tromp class frigates, decommissioned in 1999 and 2001. Despite being classified by the Netherlands Navy as frigates, their displacement (6,050 tonnes), complement (202 + 30 aircrew), and role make them comparable to many destroyers. They are similar in these respects to the RAN’s planned Hobart-class Air Warfare Destroyers (AWD). The Netherlands Navy also intends to use the De Zeven Provinciën class in a limited Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) role, having recently awarded a contract for modification of the ships’ Thales SMART-L and APAR radars. According to an article in January’s Proceedings magazine, these modifications are expected to be complete by late 2017. It should be noted that the currently planned modifications only endow the class with the capability to detect and track ballistic missile threats, and do not provide for surface-to-air interceptor missiles.

The De Zeven Provinciën class are armed with five 8-cell MK 41 VLS modules, with a typical loadout of 32x SM-2MR Block IIA (RIM-66L-2) and 8x quad-packed RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow surface-to-air missiles. They are equipped with two quadruple-canister RGM-84 Harpoon SSM launchers, an Oto Melara Otobreda 127mm/54 Compact dual-purpose gun, and 2x twin-tube MK 32 Mod 9 torpedo tubes (with Raytheon MK46 Mod 5 torpedoes). Two Thales ‘Goalkeeper’ CIWS, 2-4x browning M2 .50 calibre machine guns, and 4x FN MAG 7.62x51mm machine guns are also fitted. The De Zeven Provinciën class carry either a SH-14D Super Lynx or an NH90 NFH. The Evertsen is currently carrying a Super Lynx for Operation Ocean Shield.

HNLMS Evertsen participated in EUNAVFOR’s Operation ATALANTA in 2009; in one operation her crew were responsible for capturing thirteen Somali pirates who had previously attempted to board the BBC Togo off the coast of Oman. In 2010, HNLMSTromp took part in Operation ATALANTA, including the retaking of the German flagged MV Taipan by Dutch marines. Evertsen has returned to the Horn of Africa as the Netherlands’ contribution to NATO’s Operation Ocean Shield, under the command of Commander Boudewijn Boots, and serves as the flagship of Ocean Shield for Commodore Ben Bekkering, current Commander SNMG1 (Standing NATO Maritime Group 1), and his international staff of 24. She has been involved in several successful counter-piracy actions, including detaining Somali pirates who had hijacked an Omani dhow and its crew, and used the vessel to attempt to board the MV Namrun. The Evertsen carries a Royal Netherlands Marine Corps Enhanced Boarding Element (EBE) as part of its counter-piracy capability. The EBE is made up of operators from the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps Maritime Special Operations Forces (MARSOF), assigned to the vessel for counter-piracy duties. It may also be supplemented by regular marines.

A Formidable Frigate

Meanwhile, Singapore’s Formidable class frigates are considered amongst the most advanced surface combatants in Southeast Asia. Built around a substantially modified version of the French La Fayette class, they feature an advanced stealth design incorporating a range of Radar Cross-Section (RCS) reduction features. The inclined planes of the hull and superstructures, concealment of typical ship’s equipment, low profile housings for armaments, and enclosed sensor mast are chief amongst these. The Formidable class armament includes: an Oto Melara 76mm Super Rapid naval gun, 8x RGM-84C Harpoon SSMs, and 4x 8-cell Sylver A50 VLS containing a mixture of Aster 15 and Aster 30 SAMs. The ships are also capable of firing EuroTorp A224/S Mod 3 torpedoes, and carry a Sikorsky S-70B naval helicopter with ASW equipment (they formerly operated Eurocopter AS-332M Super Pumas).

The Formidable class are also highly automated, operated by a complement of only 71 crew (90 including air detachment). By way of comparison, a US Oliver Hazard Perry class has a nominal compliment of 176, an Australian Anzac class a complement of 163, and a French La Fayette class a complement of 141. The Formidable class are designed to operate as the naval centrepiece of the Singapore Armed Forces’ (SAF) Integrated Knowledge-based Command and Control (IKC2) network. Integrating the advanced sensor packages and armaments of the ships to give commanders the ability to rapidly assess the battlespace and respond accordingly was a key design focus for the project. Dr Kenneth Kwok, Programme Director for Information Exploitation at the DSO national Laboratories noted: “The frigate has many state of the art weapon systems and sensor systems, but it is really how you put them together and integrate them into a fighting system that makes the difference”.

Six Formidable class frigates were built, with all but RSS Formidable being built by Singapore Technologies Marine (ST Marine) at their Benoi Shipyard, in Singapore. Construction of the class ran from late 2002 until mid-2006, with all ships being commissioned by January 2009. All are currently active, and form the 185 Squadron of the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN). The RSS Formidable was Singapore’s contribution to the forces conducting RIMPAC 2012, operating in conjunction with participants from twenty-one other nations. Singapore’s incumbent Minister for Defence, Dr Ng Eng Hen, has confirmed that a Formidable class frigate (and the attached S-70B) will soon deploy to the Gulf of Aden as part of Singapore’s contribution to CTF-151.

Thales Optronics sees profits jump to £24m - HeraldScotland,"Wed, 15 Aug 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhlcmFsZHNjb3RsYW5kLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzc19ocS8xMzA2OTM2OC50aGFsZXMtb3B0cm9uaWNzLXNlZXMtcHJvZml0cy1qdW1wLTI0bS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The rise in profits at the company, which is the UK optronics subsidiary of French group Thales, is good news for the Scottish engineering sector and the wider economy north of the Border. About 630 people are employed at the Thales UK optronics facility at Linthouse, on the south side of Glasgow.

The Thales UK optronics business designs, develops and manufactures day and night-vision equipment in the form of infra-red cameras, laser range-finders, and television cameras.

The technology is put into more sophisticated systems such as submarine periscopes, airborne reconnaissance systems, armoured vehicle sighting systems, and target locators – which are like binoculars but feature global positioning system technology, a digital compass, laser range-finder, and infra-red camera.

The Ministry of Defence is a major customer of Thales Optronics, which supplies the British Army and Royal Navy.

Thales' UK optronics business, which won a Queen's Award for Enterprise in 2011 for more than doubling overseas revenues over a three-year period, also supplies the armed forces of the US, Australia, Canada, Norway, and Sweden.

The directors of Thales Optronics Limited say in their report on the company's accounts that they expect revenue growth in coming years through the introduction of new products. They note that £3.24m of research and development expenditure was recognised as an expense in 2011, compared with £4.05m in 2010.

In their business review, the directors say: ""Following a year where revenue has increased by 8% due to urgent operational requests, the directors expect the general level of activity to continue at a similar level, and, while industry conditions remain difficult to predict, revenue growth is expected over the coming years primarily through the introduction of new products into the market.""

Emphasising a continuing focus on R&D, the directors add: ""Thales Optronics has received or is forecasting to receive key contracts over the coming financial periods. In order to maintain the company's position within the specialised defence market, Thales Optronics continues to invest in research and development, as the directors regard investment in this area as a pre-requisite for success in the medium to long-term future.""

A spokesman at Thales' UK optronics operation at Linthouse said it had 14 apprentices and 40 graduates on site.

He added that the operation, which celebrates its 125th anniversary next year – having started life in Glasgow as Barr & Stroud – hosts many school visits ""with a view to encouraging students to consider science and engineering as a career"".

The Linthouse site hosts more than 700 staff, with Thales employees engaged in telecoms and signalling for the rail network in Scotland also based there.

Thales UK has a growing presence at Rosyth, in Fife, where its staff work on the Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft carriers."
The Snapper/HOP debacle finally resolved? - Greater Auckland,"Sun, 26 Aug 2012 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyZWF0ZXJhdWNrbGFuZC5vcmcubnovMjAxMi8wOC8yNi90aGUtc25hcHBlcmhvcC1kZWJhY2xlLWZpbmFsbHktcmVzb2x2ZWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Well I chose a rather dramatic couple of weeks to be out of the country – I come back and it seems as long last we might have sorted out the integrated ticketing problem and finally given Snapper the boot. Good riddance I say! From next month we will start to see the “proper” HOP card rolled out on the rail network, with ferries following in November and the bus network – seemingly all in one go now with Thales providing the hardware, from April next year onwards. Here’s what the “real” HOP card is going to look like, compared to our current card:

The new one does look quite a bit “swisher”.

Unsurprisingly, Snapper hasn’t accepted responsibility for the mess this project has turned into and find themselves blaming Auckland Transport and NZTA:

As a result, Auckland Transport has announced that they will engage French multinational Thales to develop and roll out a bus solution for all Auckland bus operators by April 2013 at a cost of over $12 million. Rhoda said “We are naturally disappointed by this decision, as we have invested significant capital and effort to develop the Snapper system, which is currently the only operational integrated ticketing and payments solution in New Zealand. We are frustrated that critical components for our integration work that we needed from Auckland Transport, NZTA and Thales have consistently not been made available to us. Snapper put forward a plan in April that would have delivered by 30 November, but Auckland Transport never took the decisions and steps it needed to take for that plan to be implemented.” “Auckland Transport is being disingenuous with its attempt to position Snapper as the reason that the AIFS project is delayed. Delivery of the AIFS system was the responsibility of Auckland Transport, with their partner NZTA and their prime contractor Thales. Snapper’s role was limited to integrating with that system, and the reality is that the AIFS system has not yet been built. What Auckland Transport also fail to mention is that of their $100m spent to date on this project, Snapper has never received any compensation for its integration efforts. Auckland Transport are solely accountable for the design, systems integration and delivery of this project”. “Snapper is ready to deliver a fully compliant and integrated system as soon as Auckland Transport address fundamental capability and project management gaps – something they are unlikely to do until they acknowledge they have a problem.”

Remarkably similar lines to those repeatedly trotted out by a few commenters on this blog who tend to only comment on posts related to Snapper. What a remarkable coincidence!

That said, I don’t think we can fully lay the blame with Snapper for the mess this project turned into. It would have been clear from a very long time ago that things were heading off-track, yet it has taken about two and a half years since the Thales contract was signed for the realisation that there’s a fundamental problem with the project to actually be flushed out and solved. That suggests really really bad project management by somebody. It might take a few LGOIMA requests for us to get to the bottom of the story, but we will certainly do our best on that count – with so much money at stake.

However, to be honest I almost don’t care whether it costs another few million to be rid of Snapper completely. Enjoying Vancouver’s fully integrated public transit system over the last couple of weeks – with integrated fares to match – has highlighted to me the importance of getting integrated ticketing right. At the end of the day Snapper’s equipment just wasn’t up to the job – something known right from the start actually – so they’ve been kicked out. Now let’s just bloody well get on with it!
