Thales, a world leader in data protection and cybersecurity, and Nozomi Networks, a leader in OT and IoT security, have joined forces to provide critical infrastructure operators with a set of advanced tools for controlling their production facilities and industrial assets by detecting cyber incidents in their network traffic.

Nozomi Networks is developing the only OT (Operational Technology) sensor currently with Level 1 ANSSI certification 1 for visualisation of network traffic, physical sites and industrial infrastructure.

The partnership leverages the OT and industrial IoT cybersecurity solutions and expertise of Nozomi Networks to round out the managed security services offering of Thales, which is already a global Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) and a market leader in security for critical industrial systems.

As their networks become increasingly interconnected, industrial operators need to rely on dedicated, non-intrusive network supervision systems to stay protected in a constantly evolving cyberthreat environment.

Thales, in partnership with Nozomi Networks, is already helping a number of global players to enhance their industrial cybersecurity and improve their incident detection and response capabilities by installing network sensors at their sites around the world and providing day-to-day network supervision via Security Operation Centres (SOCs). These solutions enable Thales to analyse suspicious behaviour and unexpected traffic to and from the external network and to detect malicious activity targeting industrial information systems.

Thales is a market leader in security for critical industrial systems. OT network sensors from Nozomi Networks will be used at its National Digital Exploitation Centre (NDEC) in Wales and will soon be deployed at the new NDEC that opened in Canada on 23 April 2023. The partnership expands Thales's expertise in network monitoring and cyberthreat detection and response for critical industrial infrastructure. The network sensors developed by Nozomi Networks and their ability to parse large numbers of industrial protocols make it possible to visualise network traffic with a high degree of precision, provide detailed identification of industrial assets and detect operational anomalies caused by known as well as unknown cyberthreats.

The specific cyber challenges faced by industrial operators

Companies with an OT infrastructure, particularly in the manufacturing, automation and transportation industries, have little or no scope for operational downtime and are therefore highly vulnerable to cyberattacks. Attacks are rarely identical, so they are difficult to anticipate, making it especially important to improve the resilience of these companies' industrial systems. Network sensors are positioned at critical points on the network in order to quickly identify attacks and initiate appropriate action in a timely fashion.

Italy awards $256 million contract for 2026 in-orbit servicing mission - SpaceNews,"Mon, 15 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9pdGFseS1hd2FyZHMtMjU2LW1pbGxpb24tY29udHJhY3QtZm9yLTIwMjYtaW4tb3JiaXQtc2VydmljaW5nLW1pc3Npb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TAMPA, Fla. — Italy’s space agency has awarded local companies 235 million euros ($256 million) in pandemic relief funds for an in-orbit servicing demo in 2026, the group’s leader Thales Alenia Space announced May 15.

Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales of France and Leonardo of Italy, said the group is contracted to design, develop, and qualify a spacecraft capable of performing a range of autonomous robotic operations on satellites in low Earth orbit.

The company did not disclose details about the 2026 mission, but said the servicer would have a dexterous robotic arm and test capabilities that include refueling, component repair or replacement, orbital transfer, and atmospheric reentry.

The servicer will be launched with a target satellite, said Maria Antonietta Perino, director of space economy exploration at Thales Alenia Space, and both will be fitted with an interface for a refueling mission.

Perino said the servicer would also be designed to serve larger satellites that it would capture with its robotic arm.

Leonardo is providing the robotic arm, developed with SAB Aerospace, the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics, and the Italian Institute of Technology.

Spaceflight services company Telespazio and rocket builder Avio are also part of the consortium, along with D-Orbit, the space tug specialist that completed its first commercial mission in late 2020.

Massimo Comparini, senior executive vice president of observation, exploration, and navigation at Thales Alenia Space, said the mission would highlight how established players could combine their skills and experience with more agile emerging space companies.

“By working together they will generate synergies that ensure the future viability of the space sector,” Comparini said, “while also developing all-Italian technologies to support the growth of the country’s space industry.”

Telespazio is responsible for the mission’s ground segment, with support from Altec, a joint venture between Thales Alenia Space and Italy’s space agency.

Avio is in charge of orbital support and developing a propulsion module for the servicer, which would be based on a custom platform developed by Thales Alenia Space. D-Orbit is managing activities related to the target satellite platform, which would be based on its ION orbital transfer vehicle, and is also overseeing the development of a refueling system that could transfer fluid from the servicer to the target satellite.

The Italian government has allotted about 2 billion euros ($2.2bn) in total for its space industry under the country’s National Plan for Recovery and Resilience to boost its post-pandemic economy.

A 1.1 billion euro chunk of these funds has been earmarked for developing an Earth observation constellation called IRIDE, or International Report for Innovative Defense of Earth.

Thales Alenia Space, the joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), has won a €235 million contract from the Italian Space Agency (ASI) to design, develop and qualify a spacecraft for a dedicated In-Orbit Servicing (IOS) demonstration mission. Thales Alenia Space is leading a Temporary Grouping of Companies regrouping Leonardo, Telespazio, Avio and D-Orbit.

The mission will be developed in the framework of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR), with support from the Italian Space Agency. The demonstration mission will operate in low Earth orbit (LEO) and is set to be launched by 2026.

A growing number of satellites are now circling the Earth to meet a wide range of requirements, from geolocation and connectivity, to weather forecasts, environmental monitoring and much more. Thales Alenia Space is therefore developing in-orbit servicing solutions to address the evolving needs of satellites in orbit.

“We are delighted that the Italian Space Agency chose the team of Thales Alenia Space, Leonardo, Telespazio, Avio and D-Orbit to carry out this ambitious project that will make space more sustainable,” said Massimo Claudio Comparini, Senior Executive Vice President, Observation, Exploration, and Navigation at Thales Alenia Space. “This mission reflects the skills and experience of established players in complex space projects, coupled with the more agile approach provided by emerging space companies. By working together they will generate synergies that ensure the future viability of the space sector, while also developing all-Italian technologies to support the growth of the country’s space industry.”

The demonstration mission will test enabling technologies for future on-orbit servicing missions by performing a wide range of robotic operations on satellites already in orbit: refueling, component repair or replacement, orbital transfer and atmospheric reentry.

These operations will be executed thanks to a dexterous robotic arm, developed by Leonardo in collaboration with SAB Aerospace, the Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN) and the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT).

Telespazio, together with Altec, will be in charge of the demonstration mission Ground Segment design, development and validation.

Space logistics company D-Orbit will manage all activities related to the target satellite platform, which is based on the company’s proprietary ION (In Orbit Now) platform, as well as the refueling system, with the transfer of a fluid from the servicer satellite to the target satellite.

Avio will carry out the design and development activities of the Orbital Support and Propulsion Module for the orbital stages.

In Orbit Servicing vehicles represent a real paradigm shift, since they will introduce unrivaled system scalability and flexibility by providing in-orbit maintenance and upgrade possibilities — also changing the whole approach to satellite design. To meet this challenge, industry will call on its unrivaled multidisciplinary expertise spanning from launchers, satellite infrastructure, robotics, sensing, artificial intelligence up to atmospheric reentry systems.

Thales Alenia Space is the European leader in in-orbit servicing, a new approach to space based on smarter, more innovative missions that make space more sustainable, as reflected in Thales Alenia Space’s “Space for Life” vision.

This Italian demonstration mission confirms Thales Alenia Space’s leadership in in-orbit servicing, following the contract signed with the European Commission last year for the EROSS IOD program.

PRESS RELEASE — Terra Quantum, a leading quantum technology company, and Thales Group, a leading Aerospace, Space, Defence to Security & Transportation company, have applied hybrid quantum computing to demonstrate significant value creation potential for improving satellite operational utility through enhancing the satellite mission planning process. The joint prototype identified potential value creation opportunities of up to half a billion annually if the prototype was applied to all Earth Observation Satellites currently in orbit. As the number of satellites in space is projected to grow more than fourfold until 2030, optimized utilization will become even more critical for satellite operators looking to recover their high investments.

Thales Group’s Earth Observation Satellites continuously orbit the earth every 100 minutes to acquire images of requested territories with telescopes. Each moment in the orbit presents unique opportunities to capture images of the Earth. In order to achieve success, mission planning requires Thales Group to consider the opportunity cost of each task against their relative priorities, and long-term consequences.

The objective is to maximize the utility of a satellite through addressing more high value requests feasibly in a given time window and over the long-term duration of the satellite’s lifetime. Each task chosen is necessarily at the expense of others and has long-term effects on the orientation of the satellite as it adjusts its angle relative to the Earth during future tasks. This optimization has to be done over the course of multiple orbits given numerous constraints, including fuel, opportunity cost, and second-order consequences.

“This is a very hard problem that is extremely challenging for existing classical methods to calculate in our desired 10 minutes time window efficiently exploring the search space of requests and finding feasible solutions accounting for priority and the chainability constraints is incredibly valuable. And this problem will only become more complex as the number of satellites in orbit and number of capture requests rapidly grows.” said Serge Rainjonneau,

Earth Observation Ground Segment Product Line Architect, Thales Alenia Space.

Terra Quantum was able to use a novel hybrid approach to quantum computation, harnessing the benefits of both classical and quantum computation, leading to superior results. By using a combination of optimization and reinforcement learning algorithms, Terra Quantum was able to improve Thales Group’s satellite mission planning process, allowing it to calculate an optimal satellite-request acquisition schedule faster.

“The challenge for us was to explore the large search space and find the best feasible solution that maximized the number of high priority images in a given time window Thales Group’s satellites could tackle.”, says Markus Pflitsch, CEO of Terra Quantum. “These methods leverage our unique hybrid approach across software and hardware that enables us to outperform the existing solution. The results, once again, underline the value of hybrid quantum computing today. This is just a glimpse of the technology’s transformative power for all industries. I am more than proud that we at Terra Quantum are at the forefront of this revolution.”

The results indicate that hybrid quantum-enabled models lead to more accurate mission planning in shorter time, enabling significant higher revenue potential for satellite operators going forward. “The way we have together tackled this problem, for instance through an initial clustering to then feasibly maximize the utility of quantum resources is novel and interesting.” says Frédéric Barbaresco, Quantum Technology Program Leader of Thales Group. Terra Quantum and Thales Group estimate their model to allow for an est. EUR 22,500 of value creation potential per satellite and day.

“With increased innovation in the commercialization of space, and the lowering of costs to build, launch, and maintain commercial satellites, space is becoming an increasingly populated environment.” says David Sadek, VP, Research, Technology & Innovation of Thales Group. “The prototype enables a more cost and energy-efficient use of satellites, contributing to the sustainable commercialization of space.” In the last 25 years, the number of commercial satellites orbiting the planet has increased from 500 in 1995 to over 3,300 in 2022 with an exponentially growing trajectory. According to the European Space Agency, the space debris (larger than 1cm) currently in orbits amounts to over 1 036 500 objects. To this end, maximizing the efficiency of every satellite launched into space becomes crucial in an effort to design the commercial use of space as sustainably as possible.

Following their successful proof of concept, Terra Quantum and Thales Group are now looking to scale the prototype in live scenarios and explore other high-value, mission critical, complex applications, e.g., around quantum security.

Airbus, SES, Eutelsat, Hispasat, and Thales said the partnership will “leverage the expertise and capabilities in the field of secure satellite communications solutions,” according to a joint press release.

IRIS2: The planned EU mega-constellation consists of ~170 multi-orbit satellites designed to establish robust European space-based connectivity. The infrastructure aims to provide secure and low-latency mobile broadband, surveillance, and cloud-based services across civil and private end markets.

Funding the program: Total IRIS2 project costs are estimated to be a whopping €6.0B ($6.6B).

The private sector will foot €3.6B ($3.9B) of the bill.

The EU will cover the remaining €2.4B ($2.6B).

The EU expects to turn on the first satellites by the end of 2024 and complete the constellation by 2027.

The Power 5: The five industry giants that have teamed up to bid on the IRIS2 EU contracts will likely represent the most qualified consortium, given their scale and unmatched technical capabilities. However, this A-team partnership may present a challenge for EU officials who have stressed the importance of a diverse and competitive bid process.

The EU stipulated that small businesses receive 30% of the IRIS2 contracts.

The group of satellite mainstays acknowledged their shortcomings and called for collaboration with new players. “The consortium will encourage start-ups, mid-Caps and SMEs to join the partnership, resulting in a more innovative and competitive European space sector where new business models will emerge.”

A group of manufacturers and satellite operators — Airbus Defence and Space, Eutelsat, Hispasat, SES and Thales Alenia Space — announced Tuesday they will lead an open consortium to bid on the project.

A number of companies including telcos are identified as a “core team” — Deutsche Telekom, OHB, Orange, Hisdesat, Telespazio, and Thales. The consortium said it is looking for startups and other companies to participate in the project.

The Iris² constellation is a new flagship EU satellite project to provide sovereign, secure satellite connectivity to government users for security and defense and economic purposes, and to bridge the digital divide in Europe. In November, the EU committed 2.4 billion euros to the project, which will be Europe’s third space flagship program after Galileo and Copernicus.

Governments around the world are investing in space capabilities for security and defense purposes. For example, Australia recently awarded Lockheed Martin a prime contract to build the country a sovereign military satellite communications system, and the United Kingdom plans to build a multi-satellite system for surveillance and intelligence known as the Istari program.

The consortium said they will create a multi-orbit constellation that is interoperable with the terrestrial ecosystem. They will look at synergies between government and commercial infrastructures, and to provide commercial service to bridge the digital divide. These companies previously participated in a funded feasibility study for the project.

“The integrated team aims to foster collaboration among all European space players across the whole connectivity value chain with a view to enabling EU’s strategic autonomy through the delivery of sovereign, secure and resilient government services to protect European citizens,” the consortium said in a news release.

The EU shared a timeline for the project in an industry day in late March, outlining 2023 and 2024 as development and validation years. The constellation is set to be deployed from 2025 to 2027, with full services starting in late 2027.

Some funding for the project comes from the EU’s Govsatcom satcom resource pooling project, with the main IRIS² contract starting mid-2025. IRIS² will complement and integrate with Govsatcom.

The contract is expected to be valued at 6 billion euros over 12 years, with some funding from the EU, some from the European Space Agency (ESA), and private sources. The contract award will not be decided until early 2024.

“Iris² establishes space as a vector of our European autonomy, a vector of connectivity and a vector of resilience. It heightens Europe’s role as a true space power. With a clear ambition and sense of direction,” EU Commissioner Thierry Breton said in a statement about the constellation in November. “Space is indeed a much coveted area in which the European Union must guarantee its essential interests. And our space technologies have become strategic capabilities for our citizens, for the resilience of our economies and of course for our armies.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999993085861206}",neutral,0.999993085861206,0

Having new ideas is the key to any company's future. But protecting those ideas and leveraging the intellectual capital they represent is just as vital. Jérôme Plante-Bordeneuve, director in charge of managing Thales’s technological assets, explains why.

Like many tech companies, Thales makes a big deal about the number of patents it holds. Why is this number so important?

Primarily because it's a key indicator of our potential for innovation. Being inventive has been part of the Group’s DNA since it was founded 130 years ago, and today it's more crucial than ever. You could even say invention is the key to our long-term growth, so it's tremendously important to protect our new ideas as effectively as possible.

And we do that by filing patents?

That’s right. Our inventions are key differentiators – they're what set us apart from the competition. So filing a patent claim to describe exactly what we have invented is the only way of preventing another company or organisation from using it.

The patent claim defines the legal scope of the protection and establishes the patent holder's exclusive right to exploit the invention. It's a guarantee that a firm’s competitors will not be able to use its new ideas for their own purposes. Clearly this is vitally important for us, but it's also crucial for our customers, because it provides them with an assurance that they are the only ones who will benefit from our inventions.

What are the numbers behind Thales’s output in terms of intellectual property?

Every year, we apply for patents on around 350 to 400 inventions. Our portfolio includes over 22,000 patents, divided into approximately 6,000 families. They're applicable in more than 50 countries, so they give us a huge amount of leverage in international markets. And of course it's our inventors who make this possible. So far, more than 3,500 Thales researchers and engineers have contributed to our patent applications.

Another important statistic is that almost 50% our new patent filings relate to our key technologies – in other words the technologies that will power our future growth. In artificial intelligence, for example, we are filing patent claims on 40 to 50 new inventions every year. Our other key technologies are Big Data, cybersecurity, mobility, the Internet of Things, augmented reality and cloud technologies – not to mention quantum, which is going to be incredibly important in the future.

Thales’s patent portfolio is remarkable for its sheer diversity. And that breadth of technologies was also eminently clear in the Invention Awards that Thales organised recently. Can you tell us something about that?

The main purpose of the in-house Invention Awards is to pay tribute to Thales’s inventors, whose creativity and passion for what they do are pushing back the limits of science and technology while at the same time helping to drive the Group’s growth. The Invention Awards are also an opportunity to recognise the hard work of the intellectual property officers and correspondents who manage our patent portfolio and keep our inventions protected.

The latest edition of the Awards focused on inventions that were first published in 2022 and filed in the previous 18 months, not including patents that are classified or filed jointly with other companies or organisations.

The 2023 invention awards ceremony.

Based on those criteria, we had a list of 300 inventions, three of which were selected. The first of the winning inventions is in the field of quantum sensors; the second is a way of withstanding attacks on post-quantum cryptography certificates; and the third makes it possible to use 4G/5G networks for military applications undetectably, while still complying with the 4G/5G standards.

As you can see, these inventions have a very broad range of applications. And I can tell you that many of the inventions which did not make it through to the final phase are equally promising and fascinating.

""Our inventors are laying the groundwork for Thales’s future success, and today they play a crucial role in helping to build a future we can all trust.""

The future of Space capability in Australia is an international effort - Thales,"Thu, 25 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9jb3VudHJpZXMtYXNpYS1wYWNpZmljL2F1c3RyYWxpYS9uZXdzL2Z1dHVyZS1zcGFjZS1jYXBhYmlsaXR5LWF1c3RyYWxpYS1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLWVmZm9ydNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Matt Dawson, Director Space Business, Thales Australia, delivering welcome address at the Australian Space Summit 2023

As a global organisation, Thales understands that it has a responsibility to support the creation of a mutually beneficial ecosystem made up of Australian SMEs and academic research institutions. There is a clear understanding across our business that we cannot and should not do everything ourselves and instead, we have a responsibility to collaborate with and promote local SMEs and academic institutions who have the right technologies or are researching into new technologies that will benefit an existing product, program or customer.

The Statement of Strategic Intent and Cooperation that was signed between the Australian Space Agency and Thales in December 2019 was an important step in the federal government’s plan to create opportunities for Australian industry and new local jobs. Space is very much an international game and for Australia to succeed we need to play to our strengths and have our businesses and researchers working co-operatively.

Partnering with Australian SMEs

Thales Australia encourages Australian SMEs to get involved to contribute both to the Australian Space industry, and also identify opportunities to carve out a place in the international space supply chain.

For SMEs, working with large multinational companies can expose them to opportunities that they may not otherwise have access to. “The space industry in Australia is still in its infancy and for any SME wanting to grow its business and be sustainable in the long run, it should look to international markets”, says Matt Dawson, Director Space Business, Thales Australia. As a multinational company, this is where Thales can help SMEs ‘hook’ into global supply chains.

“We have people on the ground in countries around the world whose job it is to find out what technologies are needed, and then search for and promote Australian SMEs to fulfil that demand”.

Thales is currently engaging a number of Australian SME’s, including Titomic and Fortifyedge.

Dominic Parsons, Head of Sales, Titomic, participating in “The latest in satellite manufacturing and capabilities” panel session at Australian Space Summit 2023

Titomic:

Titomic is a Melbourne based SME specialising in digital manufacturing, and now has a global presence expanding into the defence and aerospace industry. Titomic signed an agreement with Thales Australia in 2020 to develop advanced additive manufacturing methods towards next-generation soldier weapons systems for the Australian Defence Force. Their additive manufacturing process enabled them to manufacture lighter, stronger and better performing soldier system components.

Following on from this success, the Thales Australia Global Supply Chain program has connected Titomic with Thales Alenia Space to explore the potential of using their advanced manufacturing capability to develop critical space components such as radiation shielding, rocket nozzles, lightweight components, and more. This venture at Titomic has highlighted the immense potential for Australian companies and entrepreneurs to contribute significantly to the rapidly growing space sector.

Fortifyedge:

Fortifyedge is a Tasmanian technology start-up that has developed a low power ‘on-device’ Zero-Trust cybersecurity software solution to improve trust of the identity of users. By deploying Artificial Intelligence within the software in a fast and efficient manner, Fortifyedge is able to assure identity and learn a user’s ‘pattern of life’ activity – thus providing zero-touch multi-factor authentication and alerts of imposter attack anomalies.

Thales Australia, Microsoft and Fortifyedge – have established a project called Nexium Defence Cloud to address the issue of confirming that Defence personnel are who they say they are. Central to the ‘zero trust’ authentication capability is tiny machine learning (ML) technology that can be embedded into body-worn devices such as a smartwatch or parts of a uniform, for instance.

Fortifyedge are taking this technology to see how machine learning can met space missions such as astronaut identification, status and safety.

PWR Advanced Cooling Technology:

PWR Advanced Cooling Technology, based in Ormeau Queensland, turned their passion for motorsports into an innovative, well-respected, and global brand. Their team designs, manufactures and distributes radiators, oil coolers and intercoolers for a range of vehicles including formula one racing cars. Their continual investment into emerging technologies, has seen PWR make the move from focusing solely on high-performance vehicles in the racing industry to expansion into new markets such as industrial, aerospace and defence. Their achievements caught the eye of Thales’ Global Supply Chain team who have worked with PWR to explore new areas where thermal heat management is a critical enabler such as: rifles, Underwater Systems and most recently Space, where PWR have been introduced to Thales Alenia Space in Italy (TAS-I) to explore the potential of adapting PWR’s advanced thermal solutions for use in the Space environment.

Collaborating with research institutions

Thales also collaborates closely with Australian research institutions by sponsoring and supporting research projects that could be beneficial to enhance Australia’s sovereign interests and national security.

“Research partnerships between Academia and corporates help breathe life into a research project by taking a concept and bringing it to market” Dawson says.

(L) Eros Poli, Exploration and Science, Industrial Policy, Thales Alenia Space, Italy; and (R) Duncan Fountain, Global Supply Chain Industry Engagement Manager, Thales UK; on their recent visit to Australia to meet with local SMEs to discuss international Space opportunities.

Astrosite

“Taking a product to market involves lengthy and costly processes that require funding support by companies in partnership with university to scale, prototype, test and validate, redesign, test further and finally, productise to take to market. It is important that organisations like Thales work with Academia, moving ideas and concepts along the maturity curve to help bring them to life.”

Currently, Thales is working with Western Sydney University (WSU) to deliver an entirely sovereign sensor solution, the AstrositeTM. WSU developed the core intellectual property associated with the use of event-based sensing technology for Thales’s Space Domain Awareness (SDA) sensor capability. Astrosite uses neuromorphic vision sensors that mimic the way that humans detect and process visual input. They outperform existing optical sensor technology and have the potential to see what other sensors cannot. Testing reveals numerous technological advantages over conventional optical sensors, including:

Higher dynamic range

Greater temporal resolution

An optimised data output stream that focuses on the motion features of the image

Dramatic reduction of the processing load associated with extracting individual observations. This avoids the exceptionally high CPU/GPU processing needs and power consumption that is typical for conventional video processing systems.

AstrositeTM could provide a new capability to Defence’s portfolio of sensor data sources and it can readily be used for cross-cueing with other sensors. It could provide Defence with situational awareness from and in space, which is vital for navigation, timing and communication required for contemporary military operations. We have already had significant interest in its capability from international space operators. Read more here.

Thales is also an active participant in the SmartSat CRC, that fosters close collaboration between Industry and Academia, and provides strong support for SME involvement. Thales has participated in several SmartSat projects and is the lead industry participant on a current major project in free space optical communications that is close to completion. Thales also provides industry co-supervision for two PhD students, and has one new project in the final stages of approval.

Creating space related jobs for the future

The Australian Space Agency set out in its Statement of Strategic Intent and Cooperation that its goal is to triple the size of the space sector and create up to 20,000 new Australian jobs by 2030. Already employing over 3,800 staff across 35 sites in Australia, Thales hopes that more jobs will be created to meet the Agency’s target and to meet the future needs of the growing space economy.

News

Thales Sophie Ultima thermal imager

SOF WEEK 2023 – TAMPA, Fla. An improved version of the Thales ""Sophie"" Ultima handheld thermal imager/multisensor targeting device is on display at the SOF Week exhibition; the solution features the company’s VisioLoc, which is a geolocalization and maneuver capacity designed for deployment in high-intensity combat situations.

Tim Riley, manager of business development for Thales, stresses that VisioLoc adds advanced capabilities to Sophie Ultima and enables land forces to generate precise geolocation coordinates even in challenging scenarios including GPS/satellite-denied environments. ""If you want to target a tank, but you are being jammed or GPS-spoofed, VisioLoc uses the image from the system and stitches the pixels together. So, when you do a panoramic scan, you are able to determine your position and then you can pick out any targets that you want,"" Riley describes.

VisioLoc capability -- first shown at the Eurosatory 2022 show -- was built to enable section commanders, platoon leaders, and leaders of specialized and special-forces units to extract precise geolocation coordinates, typically Category 1 CE90 [Circular Error at 90%].

Sophie Ultima, meanwhile, provides long-range day/night imaging and target location for special forces and infantry platoons. This solution is fitted with cooled infrared imaging technology and can reliably identify a tank at distances of up to 6 km (3.73 miles). Launched in 2018, it is part of the Thales Sophie family of handheld thermal imagers and target locators, which has over 16,000 devices sold to 55 countries to date.

Another offering in this device family is the Sophie Optima, which was unveiled in 2020. It can identify a tank at a range of 3 km (1.86 miles), and its uncooled infrared technology delivers the same range performance as the current generation of cooled infrared imagers and target locators. The Optima coordinates photo and video-sharing and enables secure access that only allows the use of the camera. This device can also be equipped with VisioLoc capability.

Both Ultima and Optima are fully modular systems -- housed in a single compact unit -- and can be upgraded to accommodate future technologies.

Both are designed to be cyber-secure and are equipped with standard communication interfaces and the ability to share information automatically with other units and the command chain.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995827078819275}",neutral,0.9995827078819275,0

EURODAC - EU's asylum fingerprint database - Thales,"Wed, 24 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9tYXJrZXRzL2RpZ2l0YWwtaWRlbnRpdHktYW5kLXNlY3VyaXR5L2dvdmVybm1lbnQvY3VzdG9tZXItY2FzZXMvZXVyb2RhY9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"​

Last updated 24 May 2023

What is EURODAC?

Eurodac is the EU's asylum fingerprint database.

It contains the fingerprints of all asylum applicants from each Member State and prints from persons apprehended in an irregular border crossing.

Its primary role is to assist in determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application made in the EU and thereby implementing the ""Dublin Regulation.""

What's so special about EURODAC?

Eurodac was the first biometrically enabled system commissioned by the European Union and the first multinational biometric system globally. Eurodac has been operating continuously since going live on 15 January 2003 and has undergone many expansions and upgrades.

This web dossier will focus on the Eurodac biometric system (European Dactyloscopy System):

Its origins​

Its evolution

Some significant facts and figures for 2016-2020.

Cogent Systems, recently acquired by Thales, has been involved in this project since 2002, when it won a contract to supply the Eurodac Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) - a role Thales Cogent still performs today.

Let's dig in.

Eurodac background

Just two years after the Dublin Convention of 1990, which stated that Asylum applications should be made in the first country of entry into the European Union, Germany set up its fingerprint database of people requesting asylum in different parts of Germany.

So already, at that time, ten years before Eurodac, the concept of ""asylum shopping"" was identified as a problem that needed to be tackled.

Even then, it was recognised that a pan-European database for asylum seekers was technically possible.

While the European Commission's ""Ad Hoc Group on Immigration"" was considering whether and how to implement such a system on a cross-EU basis something happened.

Pozzallo, Italy, 2013

The migrant crisis from 1997 to 2017 and on

Throughout 1996, refugees fleeing the war in Iraq arrived in Turkey and attempted to cross into Europe.

Trafficking gangs assisted those seeking a better life in Northern Europe to exit on rubber boats and overcrowded metal hulks – scenes that continue to this day.

Then on 2 November 1997, a boat called the ""Hassan Beirut"" carrying 769 people, mainly Kurds, ran aground and became stranded off the coast of Italy, many of whom continued their journey through Italy towards Germany.

Crisis talks involving affected member' States sought to find a political solution. And so it was that against this background, the plans for Eurodac took on a second objective – not just to record a request for asylum at the first point of entry but also to register those attempting to enter illegally.

Legislation followed with Regulations on 11 December 2000 and 28 February 2002. And to implement the EU refugee policy, Eurodac, leveraging biometric technology , was designed and commissioned.

The New Pact on Immigration and Asylum was adopted on 23 September 2020.

Eurodac countries

The Eurodac system enables the comparison of fingerprints of asylum applicants and persons apprehended in connection to an irregular or illegal border crossing in 32 States.

28 EU Member States (including the UK) and 4 Associated Dublin States (Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland) use the system.

The new Eurodac Regulation No 603/2013 took effect in July 2015, and national police forces and Europol can now access the system and its fingerprint database to prevent, detect, and investigate the most severe forms of crime, including terrorism.

Why a biometric system?

The goal of Eurodac in the asylum process is to facilitate the application of the Dublin III Regulation.

It provides a mechanism for determining which country is responsible for examining applications for international protection lodged in one of the member states.

To understand why biometrics is critical in identification, please visit our 2022 report on Biometrics for identification and authentication.

Budapest, Hungary – 10 September 2015: Refugees are standing up and waiting to take a train to Vienna under the supervision of Hungarian police. Many refugees are crossing Hungary from Syria, going to other countries of Europe like Germany, Austria, Sweden, or Denmark. They are looking for a better future for their families.

What information does the Eurodac store?

The shared European asylum system stores the minimum amount of information necessary to enforce Dublin III, including:

ten rolled fingerprints,

the state sending the data,

the place and date of the international protection application (if applicable),

the person's gender, and a reference number.

​In response to the migrant crisis, proposals are being considered by the European Parliament to increase the information stored in Eurodac about individuals, such as assisting in reuniting family members.

Let's recap the central technical aspect of identification:

The system compares fingerprints.

The system does NOT store biographic data (name, place of birth, date of birth...).

Facial recognition cannot be applied here because the database does NOT include portraits .

Origin of asylum seekers in thousands - source EUROSTAT 2020

​Architecture and capacity

Eurodac underwent major redesigns, first in 2009 and then again in 2015, with ""Eurodac Recast,"" when new workflows were introduced that had to be in place legally at the central and national level by 20 July 2015.

The new architecture was put in place successfully on time, and with it, a new, more accurate matching algorithm was employed.

This graph from EUROSTAT data shows the numbers of people requesting asylum from the system's early days to the present day.

The number of asylum applications grew six-fold between 2005 and 2015, from around 200K to over 1.2 Million per year.

2020 and 2021 asylum application figures

In 2020, the number of first-time asylum applicants decreased to 416,600.

The annual figures reached 648.000 in 2021. 70% are male applicants.

This figure is close to 2019 levels and much lower than the peaks recorded in 2015 and 2016.

Approximately 767,000 applications were awaiting a decision at the end of 2021, similar to a year earlier.

Syrians (98,300), Afghans (83,500), and Iraqis (26000) were the top 3 citizenship of asylum seekers for 2021.​

According to EUROSTAT, for 2021, 535,000 first-instance decisions were made by the national authorities of EU Member States.

34 % were positive, that is, granting a type of protection status.

The 2015-2016 peak is now gone.

Whereas around one-third of the applications were repeated applications in the early years, during the worst part of the crisis, almost all were first-time applications.

Germany gets the most, then France, Spain and Italy.

EURODAC 2021 statistics

Of course, the capacity of the system had to be scaled accordingly. ​

The fingerprint database was initially designed to contain 1.6 million records in 2003.

This capacity was increased in 2009 to 2.8 million records, increased twice more in 2015, first to 3.6 million and then to 5 million, and recently increased to 7 million records, all the while ensuring a high degree of accuracy by providing that each fingerprint record is checked in a one-to-many search.

Likewise, throughput has increased from 500 messages per hour with a 30-minute response time in 2003 to 1,500 messages per hour with a 60-second response time in 2015, making today's system many times larger than in the past.

The Eurodac annual report for 2021, published in December 2022, showed that the number of fingerprint data sets surpassed 5.8 million in 2021.

The system processed 855,478 transactions.



Common European asylum system: a complex workflow

Its unique workflow requirements may be where Eurodac differs most from many other AFIS​ systems.

They are designed to ensure that only Member States can change or read their records while ensuring that individual freedoms and rights are protected if an individual is granted asylum or citizenship of a Member State.

As of 1 January 2021, the UK has lost access to EURODAC. To claim asylum in the UK, a person must now be in the country without an asylum visa. It's not allowed to apply from outside the country, either. A person would then have to enter the Kingdom either for tourism, studies or illegally.

Achievements and evolution

In conclusion, Eurodac is the largest multi-jurisdictional AFIS in the world, serving 32 countries. It utilises the latest biometric matching technology to support a unique set of business rules, achieving that with very high reliability.​

It has proved to be an essential tool providing fingerprint comparison evidence to help determine the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application in the EU.

It also sets time limits for transmitting fingerprint data, reducing the time which elapses between the taking and sending of fingerprints to the Central Unit of Eurodac.

It allows Member States' law enforcement authorities and Europol to compare fingerprints linked to criminal investigations with those in Eurodac.

We see yet more change, including new search types and perhaps face recognition capabilities.

Technical challenges and Thales Cogent's experience

As with Eurodac, Thales' biometric solutions must work in real-life environments on European borders and worldwide – at night, in the dark and the rain and wind at a seaport, sometimes at -20°C or conversely in bright sunlight.

Our expert teams can support you in meeting these real-life challenges.

How can Thales Cogent AFIS solutions better help you?

Thales Cogent Automated Biometric Identification System​ (CABIS) is used to investigate, identify, and verify civil and border title and law enforcement applications.

Cogent AFISes are already deployed to over 200 applications in over 80 countries.

Thales Solutions can also secure your AFIS system with strong authentication and encryption solutions (HSM and tokenisation), as the company does with India's Aadhaar, the largest biometric database in the world.

IMDEX 2023: Flyby and Thales look to further Jackal development after successful missile firing | Shephard - Shephard News,"Fri, 05 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zaGVwaGFyZG1lZGlhLmNvbS9uZXdzL3V2LW9ubGluZS9pbWRleC0yMDIzLWZseWJ5LWFuZC10aGFsZXMtbG9vay10by1mdXJ0aGVyLWphY2thbC1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC1hZnRlci1zdWNjZXNzZnVsLW1pc3NpbGUtZmlyaW5nL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Under an RAF Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO) sponsored trial in April, a Thales LMM was fired from a FlyBy Technologies Jackal drone in a milestone for developing uncrewed combat air capabilities.

The Jackal, designed by UK-based Flyby with Turkish partners FlyBVLOS Technology and Maxwell Innovations, providing design engineering and prototyping expertise, is geared towards filling a gap in modern operations such as air interdiction and close air support.

Speaking to Shephard, Flyby founder Jon Parker said the aircraft had capability across the domains of air, land and sea, touting the Jackal's ability to fulfil a range of missions.

One such mission could be naval gunfire support, given the UK's adoption of the LMM weapon, better known as Martlet, on the RN's Wildcat helicopters.

The duo of Thales and Flyby are also exploring the integration of the Free-Fall LMM, designed for lightweight aircraft and UAS, onto the Jackal aircraft seeing it as a complementary capability.

For the RCO trial, Flyby and Thales produced two operational Jackal aircraft and fired two LMMs.

Jackal is designed as a plug-and-play system, allowing new equipment and technology to be easily integrated into the drone between missions.

This process is seen as helping to keep the aircraft relevant with a spiral development approach, as Parker explained that once a UAV is on the ground, it quickly becomes obsolete due to the pace of change.

He added that the aircraft could also be used as a 'pipe-cleaner' to help generate future regulatory compliance and airworthiness standards that do not slow down the ability to get novel capabilities into service.

The UK currently restricts the flight of drones weighing over 25kg in its airspace.

Flyby was asked to brief the RAF RCO on the aircraft following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The company also contacted Thales to explore the possibility of firing LMM in the trial.

The two aircraft were built, and the two missiles were fired from the platforms within six weeks.

Parker said: 'War is about winning, and Jackal is designed by warfighters for that ultimate aim. The days of having a fighter pilot in the cockpit are numbered, and I realise I will not perhaps be loved for bringing about the end of my own kind. But the future of warfare is changing, and Jackal is part of that future as a true multi-role attack aircraft.

'We want to make Jackal a flagship product, creating secure UK jobs and contributing to a new future for the British aerospace and defence industries.'

During the trials, two LMM weapons were fired from the Jackal platform. (Photo: Flyby/Thales)

Having successfully demonstrated the missile firing, work is now going into the productionisation of the platform and further tactical development.

Marinisation of the platform to make it suitable for naval applications is a part of this process.

Jackal was originally designed and developed by Flyby, FlyBVLOS Technology and Maxwell Innovations, with the team flying and testing the aircraft at a dedicated range in Turkey.

Development will continue in Turkey and the UK, and the company is seeking UK partners to manufacture the aircraft at scale. Work is also going into designing weapons suited to the Jackal and its role as an attack drone.

The company sees LMM as an ideal starting point to continue with further weapons experimentation.

RFA RCO head Air Cdre Jez Holmes said: 'Given the impressively short time scale it took the team to deliver the initial trial, it's clear that Flyby could have an exciting future in this sector, and the partnering and support from Thales was outstanding in lowering the barriers to entry for innovative start-ups.

'I'm looking forward to seeing the ongoing developments in this area.'

Thales Surface Attack Products line manager James Keown told Shephard that integrating LMM into the drone benefited from the weapon's multi-role nature and the existing development that went into equipping the RN's Wildcats with the missile.

A crucial part of the trial was that it demonstrated that Jackal could fire the missile without disturbing the platform's flight.

Keown added that planning was going into establishing an architecture that would allow the Jackal to deploy other munitions. The ambition was to equip the platform with the Free-Fall LMM.

He described Jackal as a 'natural choice' for the weapon as another vector to deploy it from. The system also allows exploring the use of LMM in land attack scenarios.

Thales Northern Ireland MD Philip McBride said: 'One of the unique selling points of LMM is its ability to be integrated onto multiple platforms, including armoured vehicles, helicopters, naval vessels or indeed, shoulder launchers, each designed to address different threats.

'It has been a privilege to work with the Flyby team on this time-compressed and ground-breaking trial, and has proved that both Thales and Flyby can produce impressive and agile results when focussed on a collective, shared objective.'

LMM is among the advanced missiles that have been supplied to Ukraine by the UK in support of its ongoing defence against the Russian invasion.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9995982050895691}",neutral,0.9995982050895691,0

Greek Drone Fires First Thales 70mm Laser-Guided Rocket - The Defense Post,"Fri, 26 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRlZmVuc2Vwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzI2L2dyZWVjZS1zYXJpc2EtZHJvbmUtbGFzZXItcm9ja2V0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A Greek-developed heavyweight multirotor drone has fired a Thales 70-millimeter FZ275 laser-guided rocket for the first time.

The test marks the first integration of the weapon with SAS Technology’s unmanned combat aerial vehicle, expanding the systems’ military capabilities for close air support missions.

The drone, called the SARISA, can carry out intercept operations similar to fighter jets and attack helicopters by exploiting the rocket’s guided and unguided capabilities.

This approach enables drone users to minimize risk on training and combat missions while cutting costs for aircraft deployments.

In addition, the advantage provides an “effective, flexible and easily transportable weapon” for dismounted warfighters.

“Combined with the FZ275 LGR laser guided rocket, ground troops can count on the support of this system to defeat specific like light armoured vehicles, radar stations, aircrafts on ground, buildings etc. with an important stand-off, adding the autonomy of the drone to the firing range of more than 7km of the rocket,” a statement from Thales said.

Thales and SAS Technology will conduct further tests to evaluate the FZ275 LGR-equipped SARISA’s performance in other firing scenarios.

Forging a career in Project Management: Bridie Searle shares life as a Trainee at Thales - Thales,"Mon, 15 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGFsZXNncm91cC5jb20vZW4vY291bnRyaWVzLWFzaWEtcGFjaWZpYy9hdXN0cmFsaWEvbmV3cy9mb3JnaW5nLWNhcmVlci1wcm9qZWN0LW1hbmFnZW1lbnQtYnJpZGllLXNlYXJsZS1zaGFyZXMtbGlmZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Trainees and apprentices play a critical role at Thales, bringing fresh ideas, enthusiasm and a willingness to learn. Over the last 10 years, over 100 apprentices and trainees have qualified in their chosen field across the Above Water Systems business at Thales. Bridie Searle is just one of the trainees forging a career at Sydney’s Garden Island Dockyard, the largest ship repair and maintenance graving dock in the southern hemisphere, delivering sustainment to the Royal Australian Navy. Bridie left school at the age of 17 to pursue a career at Thales as a Project Management Office (PMO) Trainee at Sydney’s Garden Island, and says she’s relishing every moment of this opportunity.

Growing up in the Hunter Valley NSW, Bridie applied for the two-year traineeship at Thales whilst still in year 11. “I didn’t know much about Thales before applying but I was quickly intrigued by the diverse nature of the work the company undertakes. From commercial to defence, Thales offers possibilities for young people that other companies cannot so I sensed that opportunities like this didn’t come up very often.” Bridie adds, “With a traineeship, it’s a clean slate. You need to have common sense, computer literacy, good interpersonal skills, drive and motivation. I chose Project Management because the work you carry out in this type of role generates a complex and transferable skill set.”

So, what does a PMO Trainee do? Bridie says it can be a range of things, “I’ve had a holistic exposure to Project Management within Thales. Generally, a PMO Trainee rotates in the Project Management Office between bids, estimating, planning, scheduling and contract administration, but in March last year, I was fortunate to be offered the opportunity to shadow a Project Manager as exposure to progress my career.” Bridie says this approach is now replicated for other PMO trainees and will help pave the way for future trainees through the stream.

“With shadowing, I manage my own package of work within a project and I’m the Project Manager’s ‘go to person’, ensuring that the work package I'm looking after is on schedule, on budget and all the trades’ needs are taken care of. That’s my priority. It’s fantastic and the experience I've gained has been unreal.”

“Currently I’m working on a Destroyer, Guided Missile (DDG) project where I’m the Wharf and Crane Co-ordinator for HMAS Brisbane’s third maintenance availability (IMAV 03). Previously, I’ve also worked on maintenance availability for HMAS Supply, HMAS Adelaide, HMAS Sycamore and also HMAS Arunta which has meant I’ve had a wide range of exposure on different ships, Special Purpose Operations (SPOs), Enterprises and various stakeholders.”

Bridie describes herself as ‘results driven’ and finds motivation in a cohesive work environment where all people can work collaboratively to deliver a project on time and on budget. “I pride myself on the relationships I build within a team and assisting others.”

When Bridie completes her traineeship at the end of the year, she plans to stay with Thales. “I enjoy working with my team and am learning from valuable and talented people. I’ve been fortunate to have had the opportunity to shadow people with decades of experience who willingly pass on their knowledge to help develop and influence young people such as myself. I’m grateful for those opportunities.”

Bridie admits that before joining Thales she didn’t have a clear career trajectory, however that she does come from a family of hard-workers who have instilled in her the importance of a good work ethic. She also finds inspiration from leaders at Garden Island. “My role models include Training and Capability Manager, Natalie Genc and Supply Support Manager, Vanessa Perry. I highly regard their positive attitude, strong work ethic and passion for the work they do. A former Thales Production Manager who worked on HMAS Supply also made an impression on me. Being a woman in the top spot was proof that someone from an administrative role like me can work their way up.”

Bridie believes Thales’ future lies in building the capability of its people and is proud to be part of this. “I believe passing on the knowledge, skills and expertise from one generation to the next is critical. We’ve got hundreds of years of experience collectively behind us. By developing skills and building capability, we will continue to be a valuable workforce and trusted partner to Navy.”

Natalie Genc, Thales’s Training and Capability Manager says of Bridie, “Bridie is an inspirational young talent that we are fortunate to have at Thales. She is one of our rising stars and is paving the way for other trainees in the workplace to enter the Project Management Office. Bridie has also been nominated as a Trainee of the Year Finalist in the prestigious 2023 NSW Training Awards - Central & Northern Sydney Region, a huge achievement!”

ESA oversees on-orbit cybersecurity demo – SatNews - SatNews,"Sun, 07 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5zYXRuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzA3L2VzYS1vdmVyc2Vlcy1vbi1vcmJpdC1jeWJlcnNlY3VyaXR5LWRlbW8v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Artistic rendition by ESA of their OPS-SAT satellite laboratory.

Under ESA’s supervision, a team of experts from Thales Alenia Space recently performed a cybersecurity demonstration that revealed they could covertly access parts of ESA’s OPS-SAT spacecraft that are usually off limits.

OPS-SAT is a flying laboratory which ESA offers to teams from across Europe to test innovative new software that is too risky to load on to normal operational satellites.

Once the Thales team successfully accessed the control layer of the satellite, they were able to demonstrate how they could tamper with images taken with the satellite’s camera and rotate the spacecraft away from its normal pointing.

What happened?

The demonstration was devised by cybersecurity company CYSEC, ESA and Thales. The Thales team then set to work devising a way to upload software to OPS-SAT that looked ‘harmless’ but it actually introduced a vulnerability that they would later exploit. By exploiting this vulnerability at a later time, they successfully accessed the control layer of the software, which is usually off limits for the experimenters.

The software and procedures were first tested on an identical copy of the satellite kept at ESA’s ESOC mission control center. This ensured that it could not do any irrecoverable damage to the satellite before it was installed on board.

Once they gained access to the control layer, the team was then able to replace an image taken with OPS-SAT’s camera and rotate the spacecraft away from the direction it was supposed to be pointing (they changed the satellite’s ‘attitude’).

“The ESA team then recovered the satellite and successfully reverted its software to a previous, safe and secure state,” said Simon Plum, Head of ESA Mission Operations. “This was a well-controlled experiment, in which ESA knew in advance what was going to happen, supervised the tests and retained control throughout the demonstration. The test was done in full isolation from ESA’s operational missions and enabled us to learn even more about possible cyber threats. Thanks to OPS-SAT, our teams across ESA and to the activity’s participants and organizers, such as CYSEC and Thales, we can now further enhance the security of operations at ESOC.”

What was the purpose of the demonstration

Every activity that humankind carries out using computers and other digital systems is exposed to cybersecurity threats. As satellites have become essential for so much of our daily lives, we must ensure they are as secure as possible.

“Spacecraft designers and operators need to understand how potential cyber attackers think. Only then can they build the best possible defence,” said David Evans, OPS-SAT project manager. “Activities like the one carried out by ESA and Thales are often referred to as ‘ethical hacking’ and they are a very effective way for spacecraft engineers to get this knowledge. Watching these attackers work and understanding their methodology was very valuable for us.”

This controlled experiment was an educational exercise and demonstrated the value in having cybersecurity experts with an offensive mindset involved in the development of satellite systems. The OPS-SAT team learned a lot from the experiment and, together with the Thales team and ESA’s Security Office, have used the results of the demonstration to update the security system at OPS-SAT’s SMILE control center.

The method of tampering with the spacecraft highlighted by the Thales team is no longer possible – one less potential path of attack for a real threat. Are other satellites at risk?

OPS-SAT is unique. Its role as a platform for experimentation and innovation means teams external to ESA are allowed to execute software on board the spacecraft. No other ESA satellite operates in this way.

The Thales team also had advanced access to information about OPS-SAT’s inner workings and were allowed to carry out tests on OPS-SAT’s flat sat as part of the cooperation.

OPS-SAT’s ground-based IT systems are isolated from those of any other ESA satellite, so the Thales team and other OPS-SAT experimenters cannot gain access to any other satellite systems.

Was OPS-SAT damaged?

OPS-SAT is designed to ensure it can always be reset to a safe state — in case even a well-meaning experiment causes any unexpected and potentially harmful effects. It also has an in-built system to monitor the satellite’s health and prevent it from becoming irrecoverable.

This cybersecurity experiment was performed entirely within OPS-SAT’s ‘random access memory’ (RAM). This computer memory was completely reset after the demonstration ensuring that any compromised software was removed, and the satellite returned to a known state.

No damage was done to OPS-SAT. OPS-SAT at Europe’s largest cybersecurity conference for the space sector

ESA and the Thales team presented the results of the cybersecurity demonstration at the CYSAT 2023 conference. The yearly event, organized by CYSEC, brings together the European space community to raise awareness of cybersecurity threats to space assets and how we can safeguard the important services they provide.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9990381002426147}",neutral,0.9990381002426147,0

At the beginning of our tour, we enter a space full of awards that Angénieux has received for their lenses. For me, the most prestigious is the honorary Gordon E. Sawyer Oscar, presented to Pierre Angénieux by French star Isabelle Huppert in 1989. The late Monsieur Angénieux received this cinema technology award at the age of 83, rewarding a lifetime dedicated to the design and manufacture of zoom lenses at the company he founded in 1935.

INTRODUCTION

Our main hosts for the visit are Dominique Rouchon and Christophe Remontet.



They offer a brief introduction:

-- The site specializes in high quality zooms and primes for cinema, but also optics for other industries like avionics, medicine and defense (for example, night-vision goggles).

-- There are 350 employees on site, about 200 work on cinema products.

-- Half of the site is dedicated to manufacture. There is also a lot of R&D.

-- 70% of their sales are outside of France.

-- More than 1 million Angénieux lenses released in the world since the company’s inception.

-- Most of Angénieux' raw glass comes from Japan.

-- Angénieux sub-contracts some lens and mechanical elements, but the most complex lens elements are cut and polished on site, and so too with the most complex mechanical parts.

-- A theme both men express throughout the day is that Angénieux combines the highest level of technology and of craft, built by master craft people and technologists.

-- Dominique compares building Angénieux premium lenses to the precision and craft of haute couture.

-- A single lens, says Christophe, can require up to 350 hours of manufacturing labor.

TWO RECENT TECHNOLOGIES: IRO AND IOP

Christophe and Dominique present two key recent Angénieux technologies: IRO and IOP.

These topics are also covered in detail by my friend Jean-Yves Le Poulain, Angénieux Product Line Manager, who presents a hands-on session with Angénieux lenses at the end of our visit.

IRO = INTERCHANGEABLE REAR OPTICS

IRO allows for using the same lens for 3 different sensor format sizes (Super35, Open Gate and Full Frame) by changing a modular rear element.

-- This is a good for rental companies, who can use the same lens to service productions shot in different formats.

-- As the sensor size gets bigger, the focal length increases, and the wide-open aperture closes down.

-- As depicted below, each format requires a different rear element, iris ring, zoom ring and focus ring.

IOP = INTEGRATED OPTICAL PALETTE

After decades of zoom manufacture, Angénieux recently introduced a set of 12 Primes running from 18 to 200mm.

IOP refers to 3 possibilities for modifying the look of the lens, from lens front to back:

1- by inserting an internal glass filter

2- by changing the iris module to one with different blade configuration

3- by adding a rear filter (a traditional method)

IOP illustration (Image from Angénieux website)

This modular approach addresses the desire of some cinematographers to work with “tunable” lenses to obtain a personal look.

-- Different iris shapes will create different bokeh shapes for highlights in the image, including pseudo-anamorphic ellipses

-- The afocal position of the internal filter should yield the same diffusion effect for all focal lengths, unlike front diffusion filters.

-- The growing list of available internal filters include Glimmer-glass, Black Satin, Black Pro-Mist and Low Contrast from Tiffen; and Hollywood Black Magic and Blue Streak from Schneider.

-- A clear glass filter can be tinted, sprayed, scratched or otherwise personalized for a unique look.

THE CAM

Vincent Collin, who heads the mechanical and optical workshops, is our first guide inside the factory. He presents a sculptural cross-section of an Optimo 24-290mm zoom. The dark tunnel at the center creates a room for the zoom's moving lens elements:

Every camera person is used to rotating the focus or zoom ring on the outside of a lens. This external rotation is mechanically transformed into an internal straight-line movement of lens elements along the lens axis, by means of a Cam with a groove.

Vincent Collin then presents the zoom cam for the 12x Optimo, explaining that the precision of the groove is essential to the quality of the lens.

-- The Cams are manufactured on CNC (Computerized Numerical Control) machines, software-controlled systems with an array of tools to cut and fashion metal parts.

-- The Cam groove has an ultra-precise 1-micron tolerance, for accuracy and to avoid play as the zoom changes focal lengths

-- Cam precision is key, but so is repeatability. Each finished lens is physically zoomed between 500 to 1000 times before release, to “break in” the mechanical parts.

-- Aluminum is used for thermal stability

CNC MACHINE SHOP

We must don safety shoes before entering the machine shop, to protect our feet from heavy objects.

Vincent shows us a cylindrical block of aluminum and the focusing cam for their new 17-102mm zoom, which was carved out of a cylinder in 20 minutes by the many cutting and shaping tools in the CNC machine.



Distance marks on the lenses’ external focusing rings are cut by a diamond tip in a laser-assisted CNC machine.

-- The tolerance there is the mark width, about 1/10 of a millimeter.

-- Focus rings are not interchangeable; each is uniquely tailored to its lens.

-- The mechanical parts and lenses are put together in sub-assembly components before the final assembly.

Richard Bourge with focus cam and Marc Relave with painted focus ring, in the mechanical machine shop.

GLASS MACHINE SHOP

Vincent Collin continues our tour in the Glass machining and polishing workshop area.

-- Some lens elements are outsourced, but the most complex ones are finished in-house

-- Some glass arrives in circular cylinder blocks, with roughly ground surfaces

-- The final grinding in factory includes complex “aspheric” elements whose modulated surfaces are not evenly spherical.

-- Vincent says that the heart of the glass is better quality than the outlying parts, “like Comté cheese”. And indeed, the glasses look like cheeses!

Vincent shows us the raw glass and an abrasive fixture made of brass laced with diamonds that can shape and polish a lens element.

Vincent presents a CNC polishing machine, and his hands indicate the glass element above and the polyurethane polishing surface below, which will tilt to define the lens as the two rotating materials rub against each other.

The case below contains a lens element before and after polishing. They appear black because their backings are covered in varnish and plastic for protection in the CNC machine.

Some polished lenses are measured on an interferometer, a device that uses lasers to detect and measure microscopic flaws. The screen below displays a color-coded map of the lens where reds are the highest surfaces and blue the lowest. In this example the range from valley to crest is an astonishing 300 nanometers, or billionths of a meter. This digital map can then be used to improve the lens.

Below is a close-up view of a MRF (Magneto Rheological Finishing) machine which will, when possible, modify a small area of the glass surface, to improve a flaw. MRF uses a “smart fluid” laced with magnetic material, which can become a quasi-solid in a magnetic field. A similar process can be used to create an aspheric lens element, which has modulated curvature along its surface.

COATINGS AND VARNISH

Vincent Collin concludes his part of the tour by speaking of coatings and varnish.

-- He states that in an uncoated lens, as little as 8% of the light entering the front reaches the sensor at the rear, because of light reflections inside. Anti-flare coatings, ""like those on our glasses,"" greatly reduce the light loss.

-- The PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) coating machine is extremely high tech. It creates a near vaccum with zero dust.

-- An electron beam creates extreme heat (more than 200 degrees Celsius) to turn solid coating materials into gases that condense on the surface of the lens, ""just like the condensation on your tea kettle lid,"" where they solidify.

-- Several coatings are applied with an extreme precision of ""about 100 nanometers"" (billionths of a meter).

-- Christophe Remontet notes that the coatings have a lot to do with the warm coloring of the lens.

Discussions and notes during visit with Marc Salomon, Fanny Modri, Christophe Remontet, Helen Parkinson and Dominique Rouchon.

Vincent adds that black varnish is added to the materials surrounding the optical elements to reduce internal reflections.

-- The varnish is added by hand with a paint brush, with tolerances of fractions of a millimeter.

-- From nanometers to millimeters, the coatings and varnish are another example, says Dominique Rouchon, of the mixture of high tech and high craftmanship required to build a zoom.

LENS ASSEMBLY WORKSHOP

After thanking Vincent, our group is outfitted with light lab coats, to minimize dust contamination as we head into the Lens Assembly workshop, headed by Yvan Fournier.

Yvan tells us that the workshop builds zooms and, in the past two years, primes.

-- A zoom can have as many as 24 lens elements and 500 mechanical elements. There are two workshops for sub-assemblies which are then assembled, adjusted, tested and finished in the final product.

-- Optical sub-assemblies are assembled and tested in a darkened room with bright spots to highlight dust and imperfections. There is also a device to check the centering and tilt of the combined elements.

The workshop also does repairs.

The finished lenses are checked in a dark room, by projecting a chart on a reticle through the back of the lens. The lens is examined at different focal lengths for homogeneity across the frame, and for spherical and chromatic aberrations.

Assembler-Adjuster Mathias Chabanaud holds custom portable MTF device, and checks focus on long end of zoom

The quality of the lens is measured and evaluated by a practiced eye.

-- Yvan says that they check ""up to 200 cycles per mm"", representing ""about 5 microns on the sensor."" Checking focus at long focal lengths requires a magnifying glass.

-- The technicians also measure MTF (Modulation Transfer Function), an objective measure of contrast at different frequencies, using a very handy custom unit that quickly snaps on to the magnetic screen.

-- Just as important is the impression for a practiced eye of the lens' sharpness, clean image, color, bokeh and other subjective qualities at the appreciation of the cinematographer.

And indeed, the best way for a cinematographer to get to know a lens is to shoot with it on a project!

The signing of the contract took place at Thales Australia’s Bendigo facility on May 17.

Thales’ Bendigo facility has produced over 1,200 Bushmasters, which were mainly used by the Australian Army during operations in the Middle East.

Thales said it plans to begin work on the new vehicles immediately, which will include a combination of troop-carrying vehicles and command vehicles over the next 18 months.

Last year, Australia disclosed it sent 60 Bushmaster protected mobility vehicles to Ukraine over several military assistance packages aimed at helping Ukraine defend against the Russian invasion.

“Bushmasters gifted to Ukraine by the Australian government are currently in service in Ukraine and providing a vital capability to the Ukrainian Armed Forces as they fight the illegal Russian invasion,” Thales Australia CEO Jeff Connolly commented.

The Bushmaster is an armored vehicle designed for military and civilian applications. It is primarily used for troop transport and is known for its high level of protection against ballistic and mine threats.

The vehicles have also been exported to eight nations, including the Netherlands, UK, Fiji, Jamaica, New Zealand, Japan, and Indonesia.

It is worth noting that Australia is also working on a battery-powered Bushmaster armored vehicle that will serve as the basis of the army’s electric Protected Military Vehicle (ePMV).","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9997492432594299}",neutral,0.9997492432594299,0

European space giants join forces for IRIS² - SpaceNews,"Tue, 02 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9ldXJvcGVhbi1zcGFjZS1naWFudHMtam9pbi1mb3JjZXMtZm9yLWlyaXMlQzIlQjIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TAMPA, Fla. — Europe’s largest space companies have banded together to bid for a role in the European Union’s proposed multi-orbit connectivity constellation.

The group is led by satellite operators Eutelsat, SES, and Hispasat; and satellite makers Airbus Defence and Space and Thales Alenia Space.

Satellite operator Hisdesat, spaceflight services company Telespazio, aerospace giant Thales, small satellite manufacturing specialist OHB, and terrestrial telcos Deutsche Telekom and Orange are also part of the group.

The companies invited smaller businesses, including startups, to join what they described as an “open consortium” in a May 2 announcement that was light on details.

Europe issued a request for competing bids in March to develop IRIS², or Infrastructure for Resilience, Interconnectivity and Security by Satellite, after approving plans to fund 40% of the 6 billion euro ($6.6 billion) project.

Commercial companies are expected to cover the rest of the cost for a constellation projected to provide global coverage by 2027.

Under measures designed to encourage smaller businesses to participate in IRIS², successful bidders must subcontract out at least 30% of contracts above 10 million euros via a competitive tender process.

IRIS², which would complement satellites Europe has in geostationary orbit (GEO) and use quantum cryptography to protect communications, comes amid the growing dominance of U.S.-based Starlink’s broadband network in low Earth orbit (LEO) — and Chinese plans for a rival megaconstellation.

The newly created consortium of established space firms said their integrated team would seek to foster collaboration among all European space players.

The companies leading the consortium were part of an earlier study group the European Commission chose in 2020 to explore the feasibility of a sovereign constellation, which also included launch services provider Arianespace.

The competitive tender for IRIS² is open to companies bidding collectively, and initial proposals are due this summer.

However, the inclusion of Eutelsat in the group could cause headaches for European officials as the French GEO fleet operator seeks to merge this year with OneWeb, a LEO broadband operator partly owned by the British government.

The U.K. will continue to hold a share in OneWeb through priority voting rights if the deal passes regulatory scrutiny.

While Eutelsat has said OneWeb would be sufficiently ring-fenced within the enlarged group, a top European Union commissioner has previously warned of a potential conflict of interest post-Brexit.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999940395355225}",neutral,0.9999940395355225,0

The Greenfield School baseball team rallied from an early 5-2 deficit in ending its regular season with an 8-5 victory over visiting Thales Academy of Rolesville on Friday.

The 2-A Knights of the NCISAA 2-A/3-A Coastal Plain Independents finished the regular season 7-10, outscoring 3-A Thales (11-5) of the 2-A/3-A Raleigh Area Athletic Conference 6-0 after the top of the second, and bouncing back from losses to Wayne Country Day and Wayne Christian earlier in the week.







“Earlier in the year, we struggled a lot of times at the plate,” said Greenfield head coach Daniel Johnson. “But I give this group credit. They kept grinding and grinding their at-bats. It’s not always pretty, but they will grind out an at-bat. I think they now feel like we’re never out of it. We can hit with anybody. As long as we keep the at-bats coming, eventually it’s going to happen. So I was very pleased with the way they did that.”

Zach McKenzie went the distance on the mound for Greenfield, allowing five earned runs on six hits while striking out six and walking four in seven innings.

“I think my defense helped me a lot,” McKenzie said. “Going out there, being able to pitch strikes and let my defense work for me really helped me through this game.”

After Thales’ five-run second, the eighth grader settled into the game and rewarded the trust Johnson showed in him.

“I wasn’t thinking about that anymore, I just wanted to go out there, have fun and act like it’s a game, which it is,” McKenzie said.

On Senior Day for the Knights, a senior came up with the biggest hit of the game.

With Greenfield trailing 5-4 in the bottom of the third, Jaden Frazier on second and Clark Johnson on third, Jack Adair smacked a single off the mound that brought both runs home and gave Greenfield a lead it would not relinquish.

“That’s huge,” Johnson said. “He hasn’t played a lot in the field all year. He hasn’t had a ton of at-bats. But in his limited time, he’s stepped up and we just decided I was going to do something different today and give him a chance. With (Quintin Blake) being a little injured, I had to use a designated hitter. That gave him the opportunity, and he took full advantage of it today.”

The Knights had to claw their way back after Thales sent nine to the plate and put five runs on the board in the top of the second, with Cooper Nash and Evan Clark each coming up with RBI base hits.

The Knights started their rally in the bottom of that inning, with Harrison Batchelor singling and eventually scoring on a balk, and Tristan Stancil singling before eventually coming home on a wild pitch.

“It tells me that we’re all going to fight and not give up until the end,” Stancil set. “There’s a lot of confidence in everyone out here.”

The Knights added insurance runs in the fourth and fifth innings, with Stancil leading off with a triple and coming home on a wild pitch in the fourth.

Stancil set the offensive tone for Greenfield with a 3-for-3 game.

“It feels great, but it’s my goal to do that every game,” Stancil said. “My goal is to keep the team going and keep the energy going on the field, even when we’re down.”

After he put his early struggles behind him, Johnson let McKenzie go the distance, and, in the top of the seventh, the lefty sandwiched three strikeouts around a one-out walk to close the door.

“He’s been incredible all year,” Johnson said. “That’s what he did against Parrott, that’s what he did against New Life Camp. Every time he’s gone out there, he pounds the zone and he tries to force early contact, which is what we want him to do. He gets deep in games. I told him after the last game when he had the lead and I took him out to save him that I would never take the chance to win a game away from him again. So when he went out there in the seventh, I said ‘It’s yours, nobody else’s Go get it.’ You’ve got to be pleased with an eighth grader going out there and doing that.”

Greenfield will now await its seed and opponent to start the NCISAA 2-A playoffs next Tuesday, with the field set to be revealed on Sunday.

“I think we’re feeling good,” Johnson said. “We know we have to play really well. We’ll probably be playing a higher seed, but I feel like these guys feel like they can hang with anybody. If they can keep it close late, we’ll have a chance.”

‘Life-Saver’

Thales’ Bushmaster is a 4×4 wheeled vehicle designed with high levels of blast and ballistic protection, as well as “excellent” off-road mobility.

It can carry a maximum of 10 military personnel and up to four tons (4,000 kilograms/8,000 pounds) of payload.

The vehicle is also capable of traveling over 100 kilometers (62 miles) per hour and has an operational range of 800 kilometers (497 miles).

The Bushmaster is armed with 5.56- and 7.62-millimeter machine guns to support combat missions.

According to Connolly, more than 1,200 Bushmasters have already been manufactured at the Bendigo facility and have proven to be a “life-saver” for the Australian Army, particularly in its operations in the Middle East.

Arrival in Ukraine

Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine last year, Canberra has provided the war-torn nation with 90 Bushmaster vehicles for troop transport.

Connolly said that the vehicles are now providing a vital capability to the Ukrainian Armed Forces as they counter Moscow’s troops.

Apart from the Bushmasters, Kyiv also wants the Australian Hawkei military vehicles produced by Thales.

“Our soldiers absolutely love Australian Bushmasters. But now they have a new crush: the Hawkei,” the Ukrainian defense ministry tweeted last month.

Australian defense industry minister Pat Conroy did not confirm whether or not his country would heed to the request, but his country is “focused on delivering what we’ve already committed.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9994451403617859}",neutral,0.9994451403617859,0

A person privy to the probe told Bloomberg that the investigation was initiated following allegations made by Sanjay Bhandari, who claimed to have acted as a middleman in assisting Thales to win the contract. The case focuses on whether payments to Bhandari were hidden bribes. However, a company spokeswoman said that Thales has never been questioned by prosecutors on the subject and it ""strongly disputes"" the charges regarding alleged payments made by the company in connection with the project.



The Bloomberg report also stated that at 3.11 pm in Paris, Thales shares fell 3.5 per cent to €132.00, while Dassault Aviation SA, which produces the Mirage planes and holds a 25 per cent stake in Thales, saw a 2.6 per cent drop to €168.10.

Earlier on Friday, France Info reported on the bribery investigation involving Thales. The report stated that Sanjay Bhandari had filed a lawsuit claiming that Thales owed him money for his role in securing the contract. However, a French commercial court dismissed this claim in October.

According to the France Info report, Sanjay Bhandari seeking a settlement of €11 million, which he claims he was promised in exchange for his assistance in securing the contract for the modernisation of the Mirage-2000 fighter planes in India. Thales, along with Dassault (the major shareholder of Thales, along with the French State), won the $2.4 billion (1.6 billion euro) global contract on July 29, 2011.

Thales claimed that it had no contract with Bhandari or his companies in connection with this project.

Telesat: Zero news on Lightspeed - Advanced Television,"Mon, 15 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vYWR2YW5jZWQtdGVsZXZpc2lvbi5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8xNS90ZWxlc2F0LXplcm8tbmV3cy1vbi1saWdodHNwZWVkL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Canada-based satellite operator Telesat, which operates the Anik, Nimiq and Telstar satellites, failed to give investors or analysts any good news on its proposed $5 billion Lightspeed low Earth orbiting broadband fleet.

In fact, the news was depressing given the frequent past promises and assurances that all was well with the project. Telesat President/CEO Dan Goldberg attempted to give a positive spin saying that the company remained firmly optimistic, saying that “it’s not over until it’s over”.

Indeed, as if to hold out something of a lifeline for the project, Goldberg added that while Thales Alenia Space was the probable constellation builder, they and Telesat were not joined at the hip and suggesting that if another – less expensive satellite builder came along then they could be suppliers.

However, a non-French supplier could jeopardise the French export credit funding that came with a Thales Alenia contract.

Moreover, the Ka-band frequencies secured by Telesat for Lightspeed are now quite definitely under severe risk. Telesat should have complied with ITU regulations and notified the ITU’s Radio Regulations Board back in February of its satellite supplier, its rocket launch supplier and a timetable for events. That hasn’t happened.

The problem for Telesat is that – under current regulations – it should have launched 10 per cent of its 188 satellite fleet by this past February, and 50 per cent (another 99 satellites) by February 2026 (and 100 per cent by February 2028). It has obviously missed the first deadline and few can see it meeting the February 2026 deadline.

Goldberg addressed these concerns during Telesat’s results call with analysts, saying that if the long-awaited financing were to now be in place then Telesat could start launching in 2026 “around that time-frame”.

The consequences for Telesat (and Lightspeed) are extremely serious and these multiple missed deadlines will almost certainly mean that Telesat will lose its ‘priority’ rights to the frequencies secured for the Lightspeed project.

Telesat’s Q1 financials reported consolidated revenue of C$183 million, a decrease of 1 per cent (C$2 million) compared to the same period in 2022. When adjusted for changes in foreign exchange rates, revenue declined 5 per cent (C$9 million) compared to 2022. The decrease was mainly due to a reduction of revenue from one of Telesat’s North American DTH customers.

Telesat said it continues to expect its full year 2023 revenues (assuming a foreign exchange rate of US$1 = C$1.35) to be between $690 million and $710 million.

For 2023, Telesat continues to expect its cash flows used in investing activities to be in the range of $40 million to $70 million. Once Telesat has finalised arrangements around the construction and financing of its Telesat Lightspeed programme, it will provide a further update on the anticipated capital expenditures for the year.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9777952432632446}",negative,0.9777952432632446,-1

Taking a look back on the European leg of the Legacy Centenary Torch Relay - Thales,"Fri, 05 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9jb3VudHJpZXMtYXNpYS1wYWNpZmljL2F1c3RyYWxpYS9uZXdzL3Rha2luZy1sb29rLWJhY2stZXVyb3BlYW4tbGVnLWxlZ2FjeS1jZW50ZW5hcnktdG9yY2gtcmVsYXnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Throughout 2023, Legacy will be celebrating their centenary with The Legacy Centenary Torch Relay, presented by Defence Health, marking 100 years of service to veterans and their families. As a principal partner of the event, Thales Australia accompanied the torch relay as it made its way through Europe. We’ve captured some highlights below.

Sunday 23 April - Pozieres British Cemetery

The first official event of the Legacy Centenary Torch Relay (LCTR), the ceremony marked the commencement of the 50,000km journey of the Centenary Torch. The Mayor of Pozieres, Monsieur Dominique Bierwald, welcomed attendees to the town, before Eric Easterbrook, Director of Legacy Australia, spoke about the importance of Legacy, how the charity was founded on a promise between two mates, and the need for continual support to ensure Legacy can continue their vital work. The Hon. Matt Thistlethwaite, Assistant Minister for Defence and Assistant Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, then spoke about Legacy’s criticality for veteran support, and commended the legatees (the over 4,000 volunteers around Australia who work directly with Legacy families) for all they have achieved and continue to achieve for the beneficiaries.

Following the speeches, LT Col Anthony Birch brought the lit Centenary Torch into the cemetery where it was passed to Eric, before undertaking a ‘torch kiss’ (where the flame is passed from one torch to the other) with Sarnia Birch, Director of Legacy Australia who had travelled to Pozieres with her daughter Megan. Then, the flame passed to the Hon. Matt Thistlethwaite, then to Monsieur Dominique Bierwald, and then to the corporate sponsors with Nick de Bont, Chief Security Officer and Chair of Thales Veterans Committee representing Thales Australia. Also representing Thales Australia was Mark Hilton, VP Digital Systems and Executive Sponsor of the Veterans Committee.

“It really was an honour to represent the Thales Australia Veterans Committee and be one of the Torch Bearers at this moving ceremony. Truly an incredible experience” Nick de Bont.

Tuesday 25 April – Anzac Day Dawn Service at the Australian National Memorial in Villers-Bretonneux

At dawn on Anzac Day 1918, Australian soldiers played a vital role in retaking the town of Villers-Bretonneux from German forces for the second time. The Australian National Memorial now stands on the site of the battle.

Mark Hilton, Andy Kirkpatrick OAM, and Nick de Bont, representing Thales Australia as well as the Veterans Committee, attended the Dawn Service and were all incredibly moved by the ceremony. People started making their way to the memorial from 03:00 with mostly those from Australia and France in attendance, evident through the snatches of ‘Bonjour’ and ‘Merci’ mixed with ‘hello’ and ‘thanks mate’ punctuating the otherwise still and silent morning. Prior to the Dawn Service, and then throughout, stories were told of those who had made the ultimate sacrifice, alongside images of some of the Fallen projected on to the memorial. The Australian Army Band Corps played stirring pieces throughout the Dawn Service, along with the Australian and French national anthems. The Chief of Navy, Vice Admiral Mark Hammond delivered the Call of Remembrance.

“The legacy of the Anzacs is one of bravery, selflessness and sacrifice,” Vice Admiral Hammond said.

“Commemorating Anzac Day is an opportunity for us to reflect on the scale of their selfless sacrifice and the debt of gratitude we owe to those who served, those who paid the ultimate sacrifice and the families they left behind.

Tuesday 25 April – Anzac Day Service, Villers-Bretonneux Town Square

Following the Anzac Day Dawn Service, a service was held in the town square of Villers-Bretonneux, with those in attendance including The Hon. Matt Thistlethwaite, Assistant Minister for Defence and Assistant Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, Vice Admiral Mark Hammond, Chief of Navy, and Her Excellency Ms Gillian Bird, Australia's Ambassador to France.

The town’s enduring love and gratitude towards Australia was evident, and in abundance, with Australian flags, felt kangaroos, paintings, signs and notes of thanks dotted on houses throughout the town. In fact, there is still a sign that says ‘Never forget Australia.’

Following the service in the town square, the team visited the Franco-Australian museum which tells the story of the Australians on the Western Front in 1918 and the part they played in the battles to defend Villers Bretonneux.

Wednesday 26 April - The Last Post at the Menin Gate Memorial, leper Belgium

Tens of thousands of British and Empire troops remain ‘missing’ in France and Belgium. Some lie in nameless graves while the remains of others have never been found. The names of Australia’s 6,000 missing in Belgium are engraved on the walls of the Menin Gate.

Each night at 20:00, in an act of remembrance, buglers play The Last Post, the traditional final salute to the Fallen. This year, as part of the LCTR, wreaths were laid by Legacy and, throughout the ceremony, two torch bearers stood stoically, holding the lit torch until the ceremony drew to a close.

Dignitaries in attendance included Dr Brendon Nelson, and Major General Matthew Hall, Australian Military Representative to NATO and EU with Andy Kirkpatrick, Sales Director Digital Systems representing Thales Australia.

28 April – Activities in London

Meeting with The King, His Majesty King Charles III

In what can only be described as an incredible last-minute surprise, Legacy Centenary Relay Torch Bearers held an audience with The King, His Majesty King Charles III who spent half an hour speaking with everyone in the room, and even took a moment to hold the Legacy Torch. His Majesty also spoke briefly with Dan Keighran, VC, Thales Australia’s Key Account Manager Joint Capability.

The Legacy Centenary Torch Relay takes to the streets of London

Location wise, London was always going to be a little more complex and a little more difficult to navigate – or so we thought! However, the Metropolitan Police (the Met Police) made things easier for us all by cordoning off roads in order for the Torch Relay to pass unchallenged through the traditionally bustling streets.

A guard accompanying the relay was asked whether this served as good practice for the upcoming coronation to which he replied, while laughing, ‘yeah, kind of, but that’s going to be a little bigger and have a few more million people.’

That being said, the streets were lined with people, some cheering, some curious as to the event, but all taking great joy in witnessing the sight of a lit Centenary Torch making its way through London, flanked by a representative from the Royal Australian Army, the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Australian Airforce.

Dan Keighran, VC, and torch bearer for Thales Australia, received the torch in front of Buckingham Palace before making his way to the next torch bearer, Defence Health CEO Joanne Kadlecik.

Saturday 29 April – The Legacy Centenary Gala Ball

The Gala Ball was hosted by London Legacy and served as an opportunity to celebrate, while commemorating, Legacy’s incredible centenary of service to veterans and their families. There were inspirational talks by beneficiaries of London Legacy, as well as a stirring speech by Dr Brendon Nelson who also specifically mentioned and commended Thales Australia and the amount of support provided to Legacy over the years.

The European leg of the Legacy Centenary Torch Relay was incredible to be a part of, a moving and inspirational experience for all those who played a part.

Latest AUKUS outrage – buying towed array sonars from the U.S. that harm marine mammals - APDR - Asia Pacific Defence Reporter,"Mon, 08 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vYXNpYXBhY2lmaWNkZWZlbmNlcmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tL2xhdGVzdC1hdWt1cy1vdXRyYWdlLWJ1eWluZy10b3dlZC1hcnJheS1zb25hcnMtZnJvbS10aGUtdS1zL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In the latest manifestation of AUKUS mania warping thinking inside Defence and government, Australia will hand over $307 million (U.S. $207 million) to buy towed array sonar systems that could – and should – be made locally. There are some areas where we have world leading technologies – and sonar is one of them.

As well as decades worth of research and development undertaken by the old Defence Science and Technology Organisation, an enormous amount of expertise has accumulated in local companies such as Thales Underwater; Sonartech Atlas; Acacia; and Ultra – just to name the major players. In the 1970s and 1980s two slim line towed array sonar systems were developed in parallel, code named Kariwara and Narama, which were better than anything previously attempted.

In the 1990s under project SEA 1100 (Australian Surface Ship Towed Array System – ASSTASS) we built an indigenous low frequency active-passive towed array sonar system, originally sponsored by the legendary Commander Daffy Donald and subsequently managed by the almost equally legendary Jim Manson.

Australia exports sonar hardware and software for use on the nuclear-powered and armed submarines of the U.S., U.K. and France. Thales sonars equip ANZAC frigates; those from Ultra are on the Air Warfare Destroyers – and both are working on the underwater warfare systems of the future Hunter class frigates.

The impending purchase of SURTASS-E has left local industry totally gobsmacked – and for the moment no one is commenting publicly until they find out what is going on. Apparently, people only heard about this when the U.S. Defense and Security Cooperation Agency sent the following obligatory notification to Congress on May 4:

“The State Department has made a determination approving a possible Foreign Military Sale to the Government of Australia of Surveillance Towed Array Sensor System Expeditionary (SURTASS-E) mission systems for Vessels of Opportunity (VOO) and related equipment for an estimated cost of $207 million. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency delivered the required certification notifying Congress of this possible sale today.

“The Government of Australia has requested to buy Surveillance Towed Array Sensor System Expeditionary (SURTASS-E) mission systems for Vessels of Opportunity (VOO); a shore processing mission system, a spare SURTASS passive acoustic array; containers; communications parts and support equipment (Classified and Unclassified); software (Classified and Unclassified); publications (Classified and Unclassified); training; U.S. Government and contractor engineering support; and other related elements of logistics and program support. The estimated total cost is $207 million.”

APDR understands that this system is to equip a second commercial offshore vessel that Defence acquired on the sly a few months ago – only confirming the multi-million dollar purchase after being busted by the media. This second hand ship will apparently be used for underwater warfare research activities – though why the feasibility of building something similar in Australia was not considered is a total mystery.

Why Defence Minister Richard Marles and especially Defence Industry Minister Pat Conroy could think that this is a good idea is unknown. When this recommendation came over from the Department it should have sent alarm bells ringing because it’s probably more about lavish postings to Washington than it is about capability.

What makes the situation even worse is that the RAN made an attempt to purchase SURTASS about two decades ago – but was blocked from doing so on environmental grounds. It transmits on a frequency known to disturb marine mammals – unlike the French-Australian CASSTASS Low Frequency Active Variable Depth Sonar then in use. Does the RAN and the Federal government no longer care about environmental issues?

In 2002, Liberal Defence Minister Robert Hill provided the following information to Parliament:

“Low frequency active sonar (LFAS) is a generic term. It is generally used to identify a sonar system that emits sound at a frequency of 1 kilohertz (kHz) or less. The particular type of LFAS that has been linked in the media to environmental impacts on whales and dolphins is the Surveillance Towed Array Sensor System (SURTASS LFA sonar) used by the United States Navy (USN). SURTASS LFA is not a system used by the RAN and it has not been deployed in Australian waters.

“It is understood that the source level of SURTASS LFA is such that the intensity received by a whale, diver etc. at a distance of 10 meters from the source is approximately 215 decibels, relative to one micro Pascal (215 dB re 1 Pa). At a distance of 100 meters, the received sound intensity would be one one-hundredth, or 20 dB less, of the received sound intensity at 10 meters, i.e. 195 dB re 1 Pa. The received sound intensity will continue to decrease as distance to the source increases. To help place these numbers in context, it should be noted that common occurrences such as lightning strikes on the ocean produce received sound intensities approximately three hundred times this level (approximately 240 dB re 1 Pa at 10 meters) and sperm whales, in communicating, regularly produce total received sound intensities of 215 dB re 1 Pa at a distance of 10 metres.

“The distance any sound can travel (be detected) in the marine environment is highly variable and depends on numerous, changeable ocean characteristics such as salinity and temperature profiles. With respect to the impacts that arise from underwater sound propagation it is considered that the most relevant distance is that at which the received sound intensity is safe for the sensitive hearing possessed by marine mammals etc.

“For marine mammals (whales, dolphins, dugongs and seals), it is generally accepted by scientists that a received level of 178 dB re 1 Pa for intermittent or pulsed sounds is considered to be the best estimate of a safe exposure level. In the deep water in which the USN SURTASS LFA system would operate, a conservative estimate of the distance corresponding to this received sound level would be approximately one kilometre.”

The expenditure of more than $300 million would go a long way towards keeping local industry at the forefront of sonar technology. The SURTASS-E purchase is sheer madness. If the government wants to retain any credibility for its claims of supporting Australian industry, this decision needs to be reversed – now.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999796152114868}",neutral,0.9999796152114868,0
Thales Australia to deliver new Bushmasters to Australian Defence Force - Australian Manufacturing,"Thu, 18 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nLmNvbS5hdS90aGFsZXMtYXVzdHJhbGlhLXRvLWRlbGl2ZXItbmV3LWJ1c2htYXN0ZXJzLXRvLWF1c3RyYWxpYW4tZGVmZW5jZS1mb3JjZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Australia has secured a $160 million contract with the Australian government for the manufacturing and delivery of additional 78 Bushmaster Protected Mobility Vehicles for the Australian Defence Force.

The contract was signed at Thales’ Bendigo facility in Victoria yesterday, 17 May. The vehicles will continue to be manufactured in Bendigo and are slated for rollout in 2024.

Thales Australia CEO Jeff Connolly said the production of the new Bushmasters would directly support jobs in Bendigo.

“Today’s contract signing is an important expression of support from the Government, not just for the Bushmaster vehicle, but also for the manufacturing capability and Australian supply chain that produces and sustains the vehicles,” Connolly said.

“Work will begin immediately on the new vehicles, with a mix of troop-carrying vehicles and Command vehicles to be manufactured over the next 18 months,” the CEO added.

The new vehicles are intended to restore Australia’s capability after it gifted Bushmasters to the Ukrainian government in response to its war with Russia.

The vehicle is an integral part of Australia’s military capabilities and is used in security and stabilisation initiatives, including humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, both at home and abroad.

The Bushmaster touts innovative design features that protect its crew and passengers from landmines and other explosive devices and small arms fire.

Thales’ Bendigo facility has already manufactured over 1,200 Bushmasters and has exported to eight nations, including the Netherlands, UK, Fiji, Jamaica, New Zealand, Japan, and Indonesia.

“In addition to our direct employment on site in Bendigo, the manufacture of Protected Vehicles supports around 360 jobs in our Australian supply chain with many suppliers across regional areas of Victoria and New South Wales,” Connolly said.

“I am delighted to be in Bendigo to announce this $160 million investment in regional Australia, securing more than 200 local defence industry jobs for the city,” Minister for Defence Industry Pat Conroy said in a separate release.

“The iconic Bushmaster vehicle is supporting defence industry jobs in Australia, as well as saving lives in military operations around the world,” Conroy added.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9998630285263062}",neutral,0.9998630285263062,0

Thales Australia CEO Jeff Connolly said the manufacture of new Bushmasters would directly support jobs at the Bendigo facility.

“This is a strategic industrial capability that is vital for the Australian Defence Force,” Mr Connolly said.

“Today’s contract signing is an important expression of support from the government, not just for the Bushmaster vehicle, but also for the manufacturing capability and Australian supply chain that produces and sustains the vehicles.

“Work will begin immediately on the new vehicles, with a mix of troop-carrying vehicles and command vehicles to be manufactured over the next 18 months.

“Bushmasters gifted to Ukraine by the Australian government are currently in service in Ukraine and providing a vital capability to the Ukrainian Armed Forces as they fight the Russian invasion.

“In addition to our direct employment on site in Bendigo, the manufacture of protected vehicles supports around 360 jobs in our Australian supply chain with many suppliers across regional areas of Victoria and New South Wales.”

EDITOR’S NOTE: Today’s press release didn’t say how many vehicles would be built for the tax-payers’ $160million – but, other media outlets are saying 78, which makes them more than $2million each.

Anyway, this order is only a partial replacement for the 90 Bushmasters Australia has sent to Ukraine.

Progress with the Four Lines Modernisation project - Rail Engineer,"Tue, 02 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWxlbmdpbmVlci5jby51ay9wcm9ncmVzcy13aXRoLXRoZS1mb3VyLWxpbmVzLW1vZGVybmlzYXRpb24tcHJvamVjdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Listen to this article

The re-signalling of the London Underground sub surface routes embracing the Metropolitan, Hammersmith & City, Circle, and District lines is well underway. Collectively known as the Four Lines Modernisation (4LM) project, it is the biggest re-signalling project ever undertaken on the Underground network.

Rail Engineer has reported on the project in the past, first in October 2015 when we gave an overview of the project, and second in January 2018 after a visit to the new Hammersmith control centre and when training of staff had begun. In the five years since then, much of the 4LM project is now in daily use but some of the more difficult sections of line, where tracks are shared with Network Rail and other Underground lines, have still to be commissioned.

A recent talk given to the IRSE London & SE section, by Richard Kirby from Thales Ground Transportation Systems and Sam Etchell from London Underground (LU), explained the progress made and the work still to be completed.

A project overview

Whilst described here as a re-signalling project, 4LM is much more than that. After two initial attempts with supply contracts that had to be aborted for various reasons, a design, build, install, test and commission contract was let to Thales in July 2015 for a value of £760 million. This would be based on the company’s Seltrac system that had been successfully deployed first in Vancouver, then other places around the world, and on the LU Jubilee and Northern lines plus the Docklands Light Railway.

Most of these used a track-based inductive loop system to give positional and command information but the latest variant of the product is now radio based, thus eliminating the need to install wires between the running rails. The 4LM project is using this radio technology so it has differences compared to the other LU lines.

Seltrac comes under the Communications Based Train Control (CBTC) banner and, as well as replacing the existing signalling, it also includes a ‘hands off’ control system with the timetable being used to launch and run trains. For this project, LU has adopted the GOA2 standard (Grade of Operation) whereby trains are automatically driven but with a driver retained in the front cab to start train movement and undertake door control.

The system comes with moving block technology to close up headways when congestion occurs. 4LM has a requirement to handle 32 trains per hour (tph) in the busiest central London sections, amounting to one train every 110 seconds.

CBTC yields many advantages, as follows:

Optimum operational performance;

Continuous monitoring and control;

Automatic Train Supervision (ATS) for the correct routing of trains;

Makes full use of train performance giving higher speeds with increased acceleration and braking;

Automatic Train Protection (ATP) to ensure trains do not collide;

Automatic Train Operation (ATO);

Full speed protected manual driving.

The extent of the project can be seen in the accompanying diagram which in route mileage terms is nearly half the LU network.

Contract and technical content

The contractual structure within Thales is split between its offices in Canada and the UK. Canada is the design and software hub, and where the various Seltrac systems originate for provision across the world. Thales in the UK is responsible for the interface circuitry, the radio network deployment, all the mechanical engineering aspects, as well as the installation, testing, and commissioning activities.

LU technical staff take on responsibility for system integration with respect to the external interfaces and the training of operators, drivers, engineering staff, and maintainers. LU engineers attend all the test sessions and sort out any abnormalities / problems.

The system architecture is made up of:

The CBTC system command and management control located at the Hammersmith control centre;

Vehicle control centres, of which there are 13, that calculate the target running points and times for each train;

Station controllers that command the devices in the specific areas including axle count evaluation;

Vehicle on board controllers (VOBCs) that control the train’s systems including propulsion, braking and doors;

Track transponders positioned at either 25, 50, or 75 metres apart depending on the more accurate positioning required when approaching stations, needing 13,000 for the entire project;

Radio aerials positioned 200 metres apart giving 1450 radio access points;

Cabling to connect all of this together, amounting to 5,400 km of different cable types to create a virtual private network (VPN) for communication to the radio access points and all other locations.

System operation, interaction, and integration

To commence a train journey, the driver enters an identity and the train number, after which the command centre automatically initiates the data to be sent to the train containing the route and details for the journey, including the exit from depot tracks. This command message is encrypted and sent via the VPN and the wireless access points. The train receives the message, together with the target point to drive to, and commences the automatic drive via the on-board equipment. Sensor tracking then commences with speed, acceleration, and position being tracked to provide a closed loop control situation. The real-time details of the train movement are displayed to the control operator via the train control monitoring system. To slow down or stop at the target point, both friction and dynamic brakes work together to deliver a load-compensated brake command.

Adhesion control in areas of leaf fall, gradients or wet conditions is needed to ensure the train systems and the CBTC commands work together. Finally, accurate positioning is required to bring the train to a halt within ± 50cm of the stopping point, although ± 1 metre is the safety requirement. Once this is verified, the doors are allowed to open. However, if the train is outside of this tolerance, the doors will not open.

Project roll out

A project of this magnitude could never be commissioned in a single stage. In all, there are to be 14 stages of migration of which eight have been commissioned. The first was, in effect, a test stage from Hammersmith to Latimer Road, a short distance on the Hammersmith & City Line. Not only was this close to the new control centre, it also included the Hammersmith stabling sidings and was not one of the busiest sections. Reversion to the original signalling could be enabled should problems arise. It showed up some of the integration challenges between the S Stock trains manufactured by Bombardier in Derby and the signalling as supplied by Thales. Problems included geographic, physical, and site-based constraints. The stopping command when approaching buffer stops needed improved software to get closer to the buffer stops.

Stage one included extending the system to Paddington once resolutions to these problems were found, and this was combined with stage two from Paddington and Finchley Road to Euston Square thus taking in the junctions at Edgware Road and Baker Street. With growing confidence, the next stage was from Euston Square to Monument and Stepney Green, embracing the Aldgate area triangle.

Stage four extended from Monument to Sloane Square, being relatively straightforward with stage five continuing on from Sloane Square to Barons Court, Fulham Broadway, Olympia, and back up to Paddington. This completed the Circle Line and the complex junctions at Earls Court. It also represented the busiest sections in central London. Stages six and seven extended the District Line eastwards from Stepney Green to Becontree and from Becontree to Upminster.

The remaining stages have still to be commissioned and represent the most difficult as these are where the 4LM trains share tracks with either other LU lines or with tracks shared with Network Rail and other TOC operations. A particularly difficult stage is extending northwards on the Metropolitan Line from Finchley Road to Preston Road, and from there to West Harrow and Moor Park. The line runs in parallel to the Jubilee Line which is also equipped with the Seltrac system so there must be no mutual interference between the two systems.

Problems encountered

The big challenge will be incorporating Neasden depot into the system as this accommodates both Met and Jubilee Line trains. The depot will have three different signalling systems, the earlier Jubilee Line Seltrac, a plc-based interlocking machine for the depot which has linkage to the Jubilee Line system and, still to come, the 4LM Seltrac. The plan is to replace the interlocking with CBTC which then has to partly control the Jubilee Line as well as the depot. Getting rolling stock in and out of the depot under automatic control will be a challenge.

Northwards from Harrow on the Hill, the Metropolitan Line shares tracks with the Chiltern Railways service as far as Amersham. The sections from Moor Park to Watford and from Chalfont & Latimer to Chesham involve only Metropolitan Line trains but on the shared section an arrangement is designed to maintain moving block operation and ATO for Metropolitan Line trains.

Conventional three-aspect signalling is provided for Chiltern services, but the signal posts will have the addition of a blue light. If the signal is showing red and a Metropolitan Line train is approaching, the blue aspect will be lit and the red light extinguished, thus allowing Met trains to proceed under CBTC and ATO conditions. If a yellow or green aspect is being displayed for other trains, then the blue light is not lit. The system will know what type of train is where on the network. Trip cocks will be retained for both Met trains and those of other operators, mainly for the migration stages but also for operation in de-scoped areas.

Similarly, on the section from West Harrow to Uxbridge, Metropolitan Line trains to Uxbridge share tracks with the Piccadilly line from Rayners Lane. The same signalling arrangement is planned with a blue light aspect provided for Metropolitan Line services. This section may be delayed since, with the recently announced modernisation of the Piccadilly Line, a change may result when the Piccadilly Line is also equipped with a CBTC system.

For the District Line going westward from Barons Court and southwards from Fulham Broadway, it has been decided to de-scope the project. CBTC operation will cease at Stamford Brook and East Putney stations where the driver will change over to manual operation. Thus, the lines to Wimbledon, Richmond, and Ealing Broadway will remain with the existing signalling and trip cocks. The original intention of providing an overlay system to provide ATO has been viewed as unjustifiable at the present time in view of the lower traffic density and the complications arising from joint running with other operators.

The timescale for these further stages is yet to be determined. The Chiltern Railway section has some significant gradients and is in the leafy suburbs, so adhesion control will be all important particularly in the autumn. Real-time weather forecasts will be regularly available and used to adjust the trains’ performance software so as to have less acceleration and reduced braking.

Engineering trains and yellow plant

Clearly, periodic maintenance and renewals will be needed on the various routes, many involving the use of on track machines. These vary in type and include tampers, adhesion sanders, track grinders, battery locomotives hauling wagons, and suchlike. All must be accommodated within the control system which presents some different challenges.

Although axle counters are used as a back up to the normal operation of the control system, and although the data for every train is contained within the VOBC identity, they do confirm whether the passenger trains are seven or eight-car formation. This is less easy for engineering plant as these are of varying length and it is not easy to know where the back of the train is. To resolve this, all engineering trains will have a vehicle equipped with a VOBC at both ends with the 4LM software enhanced to recognise a rear end reported position. There are also reliability issues and how to deal with extended times in section.

Cost, statistics, and project summary

As indicated, the 4LM project in its entirety is a huge project. The total cost is around £5.4 billion, with that including the building and introduction of the new S Stock trains which have been in service for some years, working to the old signalling system. Lots of civil works including the building of equipment rooms have been necessary, plus some track layout enhancements. There are 137 trains of seven-car formation and 59 trains with eight cars. The latter used on the Metropolitan Line. Altogether, there are 1429 vehicles allowing for spares. The engineering fleet amounts to 33 vehicles.

The CBTC element is costing £880 million, roughly a sixth of the total project cost. Not all of this has been spent. The trains had to be retrofitted once the CBTC programme began and this itself represented a logistics challenge. In the central area, the system is capable of having a train arrive at platforms every 110 seconds although, as yet, the timetable is not yet geared up for this frequency. This is a marked improvement compared to the previous service. Overall end-to-end journey times are improved by 5%.

It has taken a team effort to get this far with many complexities having to be resolved along the way. Migrations with the connection to other control systems, roll out and the release of new software to trains, assurance across the work streams including safety, getting user acceptance, and project management are just some of them. The ‘One Team – Shared Office’ ethos has enabled an optimum team effort. Although the project has not met its original timescale, the benefits of the commissioned sections are there to be seen.

Rail Engineer will track the introduction of CBTC to the remaining sections of route. Watch this space.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999929666519165}",neutral,0.9999929666519165,0

Thales QNVG (Quad Night Vision Goggles) Prototype - The Firearm Blog,"Wed, 24 May 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZpcmVhcm1ibG9nLmNvbS9ibG9nLzIwMjMvMDUvMjQvdGhhbGVzLXFudmctcXVhZC1uaWdodC12aXNpb24tZ29nZ2xlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Two weeks ago Gregory Knowles posted some photos from what looks like an industry convention. They were photos from what appears to be a Thales booth showcasing their new QNVG (Quad Night Vision Goggles).

Quad Tube Night Vision @TFB

Thales is known for their Lucie night vision biocular (see my review here). Well, they seem to be making their first panoramic night vision goggle called the QNVG. Their quad goggle has some interesting features.

According to Gregory:

New prototype Thales quad-NVG. >120 degree FOV, ~600 grams, folded optical path on the outboard objective lenses/tubes. Clever stuff.

At first glance, the QNVG appears to have articulating pods. This is interesting but presents a problem. How does it set pupillary distance (PD)? The hinge just above the pods has screw-type IPD stops like a PVS-31 or BNVD-1431. However, the problem is that the outer pods are further away from the point of rotation. This will cause the pods to smile or frown depending on your PD. If you look at the top photo closely, you can see the objective lens does seem to frown. This is more important with how the FOV will look.

The QNVG seems to have onboard power, I do not see any power cables coming out of the housing.

I cropped the image above and below. There is some interesting geometry happening here. The two inner pods are straight forward and probably use inline tubes and glass. The other pods on the other hand more than likely use folded light path, just like Gregory posted online. The objective lenses don’t make sense otherwise.

The problem with the PD adjustment is that it relies on the pivot of the bridge. However, someone online told me they saw these in person and Thales explained to them that the inboard glass will be traditional 40º FOV while the outer pods use 50º FOV glass. He relayed what Thales told him. By using 50º FOV glass for the outer pods, The FOV is not adversely affected when you rotate the pods for PD.

While this may solve the PD issue, I wonder how the actual image will look. 50º FOV tends to make the image smaller than 40º FOV.

Here is an example I posted in my SHOT Show 2023 article. This is comparing Act In Black’s 50º FOV glass with regular 40º FOV glass. I superimposed the 40º FOV over the larger 50º FOV. But to your eye, the two are the same size. The pattern in the 50º appears smaller.

I took the images above and mocked up what could possibly be the FOV out of the QNVG.

It might be possible the optics in the outer pods makes the image seem larger than the 40º FOV so the merged images have the same scale. But having used quad tube goggles, your peripheral vision does not pick up fine detail like that anyway so I doubt it would truly matter if the outer pod images appeared smaller. The wide FOV of panos has limited practicality anyway. It is great for CQB or driving a vehicle.

According to Gregory, the QNVG will have a FOV greater than 120º. I find that hard to imagine since the QTNVG uses 50º FOV in all of the lenses and only has a 120º FOV. No mention of price but given it is Thales, it will probably be priced to compete against other quad tube systems like the GPNVG and will be sold to MIL/LE only.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999828338623047}",neutral,0.9999828338623047,0
