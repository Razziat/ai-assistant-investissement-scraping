ELFT evaluates the capacity of a solution to process accurately and efficiently incomplete or low-quality prints – such as those lifted from crime scenes.



Over the past years, Thales has been steadily investing in its research on latent finger and palm print recognition – and its recent results in ELFT confirms the top-tier performance of its technology. Thales’ latest algorithm is a distillation of innovations and display leading scores on many assessed dimensions.

With a hit rate of 91.9%* at rank 1, Thales delivers outstanding results. Moreover, Thales algorithm uses less than half the computing power required by other vendors. It is by far the fastest among all participating suppliers’ – comparatively more than 50% faster than any other vendor’s – allowing Thales to deliver excellent accuracy at lower costs and with greater energy efficiency.

In addition, Thales sees a 44% improvement of its performance on Detection Error Tradeoff (DET), measuring the balance between false positive and false negative. This major enhancement brings sizeable reduction of operating costs – such as unnecessary practitioner time spent manually comparing prints on weak hits.

ELFT results speak to Thales’ commitment not only to provide world-class biometric algorithms – but also innovative solutions with unrivalled performance, built with operational concerns in mind.



Thales is the trusted supplier of dozens of security forces around the world – nearly 100 Thales ABIS are today used for their forensic duties.

The $3.6 billion acquisition places Thales among the world’s largest cybersecurity vendors by revenue, the company said.

Imperva CEO Pam Murphy

Defense and aerospace company Thales announced Monday it has closed its $3.6 billion acquisition of cybersecurity vendor Imperva, a bit ahead of schedule.

Thales’ acquisition of Imperva from private equity firm Thoma Bravo had been expected to close in early 2024, the company said when it announced the deal in July.

[Related: The 10 Hottest Cloud Security Startup Companies Of 2023]

The acquisition elevates Thales into the ranks of the world’s largest security vendors, the company said, with cybersecurity revenue of $2.6 billion expected in 2024. Thales previously said the acquisition of Imperva would add about $500 million in revenue.

“With integration beginning in January, we look forward to helping customers secure apps, data, and identities as one company,” Imperva CEO Pam Murphy said Monday in a post on X.

While not mentioned in a news release Monday from Thales, Murphy was quoted in a separate release from Thoma Bravo, saying that “we are excited to build on the momentum we have achieved with Thoma Bravo and begin our new chapter with Thales.“

CRN has reached out to Thales for details on Murphy’s role at Thales.

A longtime player in application security categories such as web application firewall and DDoS protection, Imperva has expanded in recent years into emerging segments of the market, such as API security, while also bringing a growing focus on other related categories such as data security.

Many customers are now looking to Imperva channel partners to deliver services around the vendor’s offerings, including in areas such as API security and data security that require a high degree of expertise, Imperva Channel Chief Micheal McCollough said in an interview with CRN earlier this year.

France-based Thales said it now employs more than 5,800 cybersecurity professionals across 68 countries following the acquisition of San Mateo, Calif.-based Imperva.

It’s the ninth acquisition in security for Thales and the second largest behind its $5.6 billion deal for Gemalto in 2019. Previously, Thales had reportedly been eyeing an acquisition of Atos’ cybersecurity business in 2022, but a deal did not materialize.

Thales said in its news release that its cybersecurity portfolio is now focused around application security, data security and identity and access management.

“Thales is now uniquely positioned to help customers protect the heart of their digital ecosystem: applications, data and identities,” Thales CEO Patrice Caine said in the release.

The company did not specify how many employees the Imperva acquisition will add, but said that its North America digital security workforce will increase by “almost a third.”

After operating as a publicly traded company for about eight years, following its 2011 IPO, Imperva went private in early 2019 when it was acquired by Thoma Bravo for $2.1 billion.

Thoma Bravo has been a prolific acquirer of cybersecurity vendors in recent years, with a portfolio that currently includes Proofpoint, Sophos and SailPoint, along with significant stakes in a number of other security vendors. The private equity firm also owns Ping Identity, which the firm combined with another identity security vendor, ForgeRock, in August.

Thales's Dividend Analysis

A Glimpse at Thales's Dividend History

Thales has maintained a consistent dividend payment record since 2018. Dividends are currently distributed on a bi-annual basis. Below is a chart showing annual Dividends Per Share for tracking historical trends.

Thales's Dividend Analysis

Breaking Down Thales's Dividend Yield and Growth

As of today, Thales currently has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.10% and a 12-month forward dividend yield of 2.19%. This suggests an expectation of increased dividend payments over the next 12 months.

Over the past three years, Thales's annual dividend growth rate was 6.90%. Extended to a five-year horizon, this rate decreased to 2.70% per year. And over the past decade, Thales's annual dividends per share growth rate stands at 7.10%.

Story continues

Based on Thales's dividend yield and five-year growth rate, the 5-year yield on cost of Thales stock as of today is approximately 2.40%.

Thales's Dividend Analysis

The Sustainability Question: Payout Ratio and Profitability

To assess the sustainability of the dividend, one needs to evaluate the company's payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends. A lower ratio suggests that the company retains a significant part of its earnings, thereby ensuring the availability of funds for future growth and unexpected downturns. As of 2023-06-30, Thales's dividend payout ratio is 0.53.

Thales's profitability rank, offers an understanding of the company's earnings prowess relative to its peers. GuruFocus ranks Thales's profitability 7 out of 10 as of 2023-06-30, suggesting good profitability prospects. The company has reported positive net income for each year over the past decade, further solidifying its high profitability.

Growth Metrics: The Future Outlook

To ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. Thales's growth rank of 7 out of 10 suggests that the company's growth trajectory is good relative to its competitors.

Revenue is the lifeblood of any company, and Thales's revenue per share, combined with the 3-year revenue growth rate, indicates a strong revenue model. Thales's revenue has increased by approximately -1.40% per year on average, a rate that underperforms approximately 61.65% of global competitors.

The company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years, Thales's earnings increased by approximately 4.80% per year on average, a rate that underperforms approximately 48.4% of global competitors.

Lastly, the company's 5-year EBITDA growth rate of 3.80%, which underperforms approximately 56.35% of global competitors.

Concluding Insights on Thales's Dividend Prospects

In summary, Thales's upcoming dividend, historical dividend stability, and growth indicators present a mixed picture for investors. The company's consistent dividend history and reasonable payout ratio suggest a sustainable dividend policy. However, the growth metrics, particularly the revenue and earnings growth rates, indicate some challenges that could affect future dividend increases. Thales's solid profitability rank and yield on cost offer a positive note, but investors should also consider the company's underperformance in growth compared to industry peers. As Thales navigates the complexities of the aerospace and defense sector, investors may want to keep an eye on these factors when evaluating the company's long-term dividend potential.

Thales project manager Miguel Bueno said that the new surveillance capability’s improvements were implemented in such a short time thanks to the Civil Guard’s commitment to the changes.

“The complex location of the surveillance systems, the coordination of different partners, the acquisition of the best performing equipment and the tight deadline for implementation have been some of the challenges of the project, which has been achieved thanks to the collaboration and alignment of all parties involved including the Melilla CG command itself,” he said.

The command’s system upgrades come after terrorism-related activities in the region.

In October, Spain arrested a 59-year-old jihadist recruiter in Melilla, months after an Islamic State jihadist group supporter was arrested in Nador, a neighboring Moroccan town.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996029734611511}",neutral,0.9996029734611511,0
"""With 6G, science fiction is about to become reality!"" - Thales","Wed, 06 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9ncm91cC9pbm5vdmF0aW9uL21hZ2F6aW5lLzZnLXNjaWVuY2UtZmljdGlvbi1hYm91dC1iZWNvbWUtcmVhbGl0edIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"""With 6G, science fiction is about to become reality!""

Farther, faster. With ultra-high speeds and near-instantaneous transmission, 5G not only boosts performance, it ushers in a digital revolution and enables new use cases in the commercial world and for the military. Hélène Bachatène, VP Research, Technology & Innovation, explains why Thales has such a pivotal role in this new ecosystem and why we need to think now about 6G, planned for 2030.

Today, we’ve reached the fifth generation of network standards for mobile telephony, from 1G in 1980, which allowed the first analogue wireless transmission, to 4G, which considerably increased connection speeds. Why the need for this new step forward with 5G?

By offering even higher data rates — up to 100 times faster than initial 4G networks — reducing latency and limiting the risk of network saturation, 5G has significantly increased performance to the level needed for mission-critical systems applications, such as in medicine and military theatres of operations. But that’s not all.

5G is a paradigm shift, because it allows network softwarisation (see box 1) at a time when the cloud and software are revolutionising the telecoms industry. Indeed, 5G is inseparable from the advent of the Internet of Things, which allows our physical devices to communicate with each other and their digital twins.

Today, there are more than 500 million connected devices around the world, which all need to share information efficiently to enable these data-driven architectures to function. In this new ecosystem, only 5G can deliver a fully satisfactory level of performance.

1. Toward virtual networks. Since the turn of the 2020s, software-defined networking (SDN) has allowed the migration of networks to the cloud by separating hardware from software and applications. Known as softwarisation, it’s revolutionising the business of operators, who benefit from greater flexibility, cost savings and greater scope for pooling. This more responsive approach makes better use of network resources so they can be adapted to the ever-growing needs of businesses and applications.

Thales CTO Bernhard Quendt has identified 5G/6G as one of the disruptive technologies set to revolutionise our daily lives and in which Thales intends to invest especially heavily. Why is it such an important technology for the company?

First, because the future applications promised by 5G/6G will have a major impact on the architectures we’re currently designing for our civil and defence customers.

Thales has no intention to become a network operator in charge of rolling out 5G/6G in France or Europe. Our role is to help our customers prepare for the future. We need to ensure they always have the world-class connectivity and applications they need in the decades ahead. We operate in a fast-paced tech industry where we need to be constantly thinking ahead of the curve. The imperative is always the same: ensure the security of data and complex systems at a time when networks are increasingly fragmented. For this reason, we can’t rest on our laurels with existing standards.

The imperative is always the same: ensure the security of data and complex systems at a time when networks are increasingly fragmented.

Is that why Thales has engaged with Beyond 5G?

Yes, we’re involved in this collaborative project (see box 2) because more than ever cybersecurity is a necessary precondition of our sovereignty. Beyond 5G will give organisations greater control over their security by letting them set their own parameters and free themselves from reliance on providers and operators.

2. Beyond 5G: the breakthrough is already here. Launched in 2021 by Thales in partnership with Ericsson France and the Institut Mines-Télécom engineering school and Eurecom in Sophia-Antipolis, the Beyond 5G research project seeks to unlock the full potential of 5G. Focus areas include development of architectures to meet the needs of critical markets and consolidation of sovereignty such as cybersecurity and integration of big data and artificial intelligence. By mobilising dozens of researchers from all stakeholders, the project sets out to design technical solutions for the development of networks and new use cases for the industry of the future and the healthcare, transport and other sectors. It will be completed in 2024.

But there’s another challenge ahead: we need to adapt to the imminent emergence of quantum technologies and supercomputers, which represent a potential threat to security, due to their sheer processing power. Our commitment to Beyond 5G is a reminder that Thales never waits for a new level to be reached. Rather, we develop our solutions ahead of time. This is also reflected in our involvement in intermediate 4G LTE (Long Term Evolution) technologies, which today enable soldiers, for example, to share data more easily and securely in a theatre of operations.

We’re always looking beyond the standards currently being sold. Change is permanent: one generation always paves the way for the next. And this is especially true with 5G and 6G.

What are the benefits of 5G?

The real merits of fifth-generation networks aren’t found in the services offered by civil operators today. Plus, 5G isn’t yet widely rolled out in France or Europe, compared with the United States and China, which are the driving forces of this technology.

5G has demonstrated it’s possible to develop private networks for industry with the necessary connection speeds and security. Another benefit is network slicing. In other words, the ability to use the same physical architecture but “slice” it into multiple virtual networks. Each slice can then be configured with its own quality-of-service criteria, such as security.

This is important for Thales and its activities, especially because military law has different levels of classification and requirements for the data on its networks.

Has 5G lived up to its promises?

Yes it has, in many respects — speeds up to 10 Gbit per second, 1,000 times more bandwidth per unit area, 100% coverage, drastically reduced network power consumption and excellent battery life for energy-efficient IoT devices.

But one aspect in particular still needs improvement, namely latency. The target set by 5G standards was 10 milliseconds. The average human reaction time to a visual stimulus is 250 ms, or a quarter of a second. So, imagine the extraordinary potential of a car, for example, fitted with an onboard system capable of reacting 25 times faster than us, while responding to incoming information and relaying its responses to other vehicles to the nearest 10 milliseconds. We’re not there yet. Which is why 5G should be seen not as an end in itself, but as a necessary step in the ongoing evolution of mobile networks, ahead of 6G.

Have we entered an age of immediacy?

The crucial challenge is to achieve infinitesimally low latency and the shortest data processing time in order to provide stakeholders with the best possible decision support.

For military users, we could foresee a move to near-real time, which will allow for almost instant decisions. But the evolution of network standards needs to be coupled with AI and the defence cloud, so the network learns from previous tasks to improve service with future requests.

As with the question of immediacy, our teams are busy working on autonomic management. This refers to the ability of networks to use AI and machine learning to dynamically adapt and self-configure so they can offer the best possible performance while limiting the consumption of technological and human resources.

Our researchers are working hard on techniques that will eventually enable communication networks to autonomously identify and solve problems and optimise their use of resources according to mission requirements.

Our expertise in the field of autonomous networks could be a major asset for Europe in the race to 6G. Thales is making this argument as part of the Hexa-X project, launched in late 2020 by Nokia to lay the foundations for the pre-standardisation of future mobile communications.

Does Thales’s know-how and experience play a part in setting new communication standards?

Until now, access to mobile networks from a user terminal required terrestrial access points. One of Thales’s major achievements, under the leadership of Thales Alenia Space, was to push for the integration of non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), including satellite networks, into the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) 5G-6G standard, which coordinates cooperation between telecoms and standards bodies.

It will then be possible to directly access the 5G or 6G mobile network with the same terminal, whether via a terrestrial or non-terrestrial relay (low-Earth orbit satellites, high-altitude platforms, drones). These non-terrestrial or 3D components will seamlessly complement and/or supplement network coverage with Beyond 5G, then 6G.

Why is the rollout of 6G not planned before 2030?

One generation of mobile networks typically runs for 10 years. We’re currently at 5G. And to meet the ambitious goals of 6G, a number of technical hurdles need to be overcome, not least the question of materials.

The transition to terahertz (THz) frequencies calls for state-of-the-art materials, which are currently being developed. The more material you use to deliver high-frequency performance, the greater the issues around energy dissipation. Tests are being conducted today on graphene and metamaterials, which will play a vitally important role for thermal, optical, electrical and electronic functions.

We can also expect to see greater demand for III-V semiconductors, which are widely used in 5G. The question of materials is crucial, because it determines the technical feasibility of the phenomenal potential of 6G.

So, what exactly will 6G offer?

Its applications defy the imagination, offering both virtual and physical experiences. With 100 Gigabits per second, 6G will take us into the realm of the instantaneous.

It’s hard to grasp all the benefits sixth generation will soon offer in e-health, transport, logistics, robotics and cybersecurity. But one thing is certain: we’re moving from science fiction to science reality.

We’ll be able to create digital twins in the cloud and interconnected at high speed, which will allow us to explore the real world beyond the constraints of space and time. As an industry specialist, it’s fascinating. Imagine being able to offer solutions or solve problems live in an immersive environment and create digital replicas of real objects for monitoring, diagnostics and prognostics.

Augmented reality and holograms, which are still in their infancy today, will also reveal their full potential. 6G will tie together the human, physical and digital worlds: research is currently focusing on ways to taste, smell and even touch objects via the network. You may have heard it said: 6G will usher in the “internet of the senses”!

While 5G is paving the way today, 6G will open a whole new realm of possibilities for digital applications.

Mobile holograms, digital avatars… What next, teleport machines?

We’re not there yet, but never say never! While 5G is paving the way today, 6G will open a whole new realm of possibilities for digital applications, as reflected in the current dash for patents.

The rivalry between the major powers for 6G serves as a reminder: it’s critically important for both technological sovereignty and leadership. For three years now, Thales has been more mobilised than ever around these issues, responding to requests from the French government and Europe.

We’ve even carried out a demonstration for NATO on the risks and benefits of future mobile connectivity for cybersecurity. We currently have teams working on the digital applications of 5G and 6G in various departments, from cybersecurity to space, and we’re constantly talking to customers so we can understand their expectations and the issues they face.

We’re always on the lookout for people who can grasp not just the communication side but also the broader ecosystem: systems, software, cybersecurity and connectivity.

The possibilities offered by 6G are extraordinary. It’s up to us to invent the applications of the future!","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.999613344669342}",positive,0.999613344669342,1

FLEX satellite will be used to map the fluorescence of the Earth’s vegetation, which will provide a better understanding of the Earth’s state of health and vegetation productivity on a global scale. As prime contractor, Thales Alenia Space will lead the satellite platform assembly, integration and test campaign planned in 2025, following the receipt of the FLORIS (Fluorescence Imaging Spectrometer) innovative instrument. Developed by Leonardo, this high-resolution imaging spectrometer will map the Earth’s vegetation fluorescence to quantify photosynthetic activity.

Information from FLEX will improve our understanding of how carbon moves between plants and the atmosphere and how photosynthesis affects the carbon and water cycles. In addition, information from FLEX will give us a better insight into plant health. This is especially important today since the Earth’s growing population is placing increasing demands on the production of food and animal feed. It is estimated that there will have to be more than a 50% increase in agricultural production by 2050 to meet demand. Understanding plant health and productivity is therefore essential to managing resources.

The FLEX satellite will orbit in tandem with one of the Sentinel-3 satellites (part of Europe’s Copernicus program), also built by Thales Alenia Space. It will take advantage of Sentinel-3’s optical and thermal sensors to provide an integrated package of measurements to assess plant health.

"“Edge computing can be useful if it's part of a comprehensive, carefully managed cloud strategy” - Thales","Tue, 12 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGFsZXNncm91cC5jb20vZW4vZ3JvdXAvaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi9tYWdhemluZS9lZGdlLWNvbXB1dGluZy1jYW4tYmUtdXNlZnVsLWlmLWl0cy1wYXJ0LWNvbXByZWhlbnNpdmUtY2FyZWZ1bGx5LW1hbmFnZWTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“Edge computing can be useful if it’s part of a comprehensive, carefully managed cloud strategy” Innovation EDGE COMPUTING Share this article

While edge computing might sound like the latest buzzword, it offers new opportunities for managing and creating value from machine-generated data. For Thales, which has long made designing ever-smarter sensors a priority, edge computing could pave the way to promising new applications. But as Laurent Laudinet - Internet-based Technology Segment Manager at Thales Research & Technology - explains, this new cloud computing paradigm poses additional cybersecurity challenges that demand particularly close attention.

© Thomas Béhuret

Edge computing is a distributed model in which data is processed locally, closer to where it’s generated, rather than centrally. Some analysts claim that this optimised approach will be a cornerstone of tomorrow’s enterprise computing environment, on account of the possibilities it seems to offer. What’s your view?

To understand why edge computing is important, you have to look at it as part of a wider trend in enterprise transformation towards the convergence of information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) (see below).

IT / OT : this underlying trend, which accelerated in the mid-2000s, involves a narrowing of the gap between two previously separate spheres: OT, which refers to the hardware and software used to control industrial information systems, and IT, which plays a similar role but for enterprise information systems (EIS).

The world of OT has to do with physical machines, sensors and industrial processes. In the past, these systems tended to exist in a separate silo from IT, which focuses on data management, processing and analytics. This two-track approach was attributable in part to specialisation, but also to industrial-process safety and security concerns.

Edge computing promises to narrow this gap. In the past, some computing and data-processing operations could only operate on-premise for latency or security reasons. But nowadays these same operations can be executed on machines at the edge of the network.

Edge computing promises similar possibilities for OT as cloud computing did for IT, including the option of bringing regular application updates closer to the user. What’s more, many enterprises have already migrated their information systems to the cloud. So edge computing has an added benefit in that it enables connectivity between different industrial information systems, linking data from previously isolated sources. From a business and financial perspective, this new capability holds immense promise.

The game-changing potential of edge computing is now widely recognised. But at Thales, we believe that it can only be useful if it is part of a comprehensive, carefully managed cloud strategy, in its broadest sense. That’s because edge computing is merely a first step. In the longer term, it will give way to other models: ""fog computing"", where compute resources are distributed as logically and efficiently as possible across network nodes and, even further down the line, ""liquid computing"", where these resources are all allocated dynamically.

Edge computing enables connectivity between different industrial information systems, linking data from previously isolated sources. From a business and financial perspective, this new capability holds immense promise.

Will edge computing change how organisations process their data?

Edge computing represents a paradigm shift, so it will clearly influence the way embedded applications are designed.

Going forward, the application context will become platform-dependent. Similarly, the burden of responsibility for efficient service delivery will rest with the platform itself. In that sense, edge computing will fundamentally alter how applications are built, requiring close collaboration between software and hardware design teams. And its effects will be felt at all levels, right through to front-line operations.

In the world of IT, the emergence of cloud computing led to a process of mass standardisation. The same is happening now in OT with edge computing. This transformation is neatly captured by the image of “pets” versus “cattle” – a common metaphor used by cloud engineers to refer to the advent of the data centre era.

In the early days of IT, servers were individual machines with their own names. Each time an upgrade was needed, the work had to be done server by server – and by hand. But when the tech giants and other cloud providers brought their solutions to market, this makeshift approach became obsolete. Instead, the emphasis shifted to efficiently managing an ever-growing network of servers, using techniques such as auto-configuration and bulk maintenance.

Edge computing represents a similar kind of step change, only this time in the world of OT. The transition from isolated machines – or small clusters of machines – to entire suites of devices will transform the problem from one of performance to one of logistics and supply chain management. In short, we’ll need to rip up the rule book and start again.

To take another analogy, consider the difference between a single unmanned combat air vehicle and a swarm of drones. In the first case, operational performance depends on painstakingly configuring a highly specialised system. But in the second case, mission success rests less on how each part of the whole is configured and more on how they collaborate within the swarm.

What are the implications of this new paradigm in terms of safety and security, which is a key consideration for the critical systems developed by Thales?

Edge computing bears many similarities with smart sensors – a flagship Thales success story – in the sense that it involves moving computing resources and functions closer to sources of data generation.

That said, safety and security are of course the number one priority when you’re developing critical systems like ours, especially when lives are at stake. Since all our technologies are fully qualified and certified, upgrading them will inevitably be a time-consuming process.

Safety and security are the number one priority when you’re developing critical systems like ours, especially when lives are at stake.

Before we can embed edge computing functions into our existing systems, we’ll need to run extensive tests to make sure we’ve addressed the risks associated with mass standardisation, such as dynamic software updates. It will also take time to have these upgraded systems certified. It’s also important to maintain an appropriate level of segregation between environments, so that we can modify and upgrade components without compromising the system as a whole.

On a more general note, the edge computing model raises its own set of unique risks and challenges. We’ll need to keep these in mind if we are to maintain high standards of operational performance, safety and security.

What are these risks and challenges, exactly?

First and foremost, having geographically distributed data-processing machines – as is the case in an edge architecture – poses cybersecurity risks. Take, for example, a suite of devices installed along a train track: each device is embedded in a piece of physical infrastructure that isn’t necessarily secure at all times. So there’s a risk that one or more of the constituent compute nodes could fail. The answer, in this case, is to apply the “zero trust” principle: an approach used in cybersecurity that assumes that no individual node can automatically be trusted.

At Thales, we see this principle as critical to maintaining functional chain resilience when a node goes offline. It’s equally critical in withstanding supply chain attacks, which are a common threat in cloud architectures. This need for resilience means designing execution environments that can support third-party applications without the behaviour of these applications compromising the security of the system as a whole. It’s important to bear these considerations in mind when, like Thales, you’re pursuing a cohesive open-innovation strategy.

Assuming these risks and challenges can be overcome, what benefits could edge computing bring to the sectors and industries that Thales serves?

To my mind, the clearest benefit is that it implies shoring up the functional chains I mentioned earlier. These chains are the very backbone of an edge computing model, so it’s important that they’re properly managed and fully secure. The deployment of countless standardised compute nodes makes these chains more robust and autonomous than ever before. For example, if one machine goes offline, the computation can resume elsewhere, on another node. It’s easy to see what a difference this could make for any type of technology where a break in the information-processing chain could cause the entire system to grind to a halt.

One example would be self-protection for an armoured vehicle, where the option for one compute node to take over when another one fails can prove critical at decisive moments. Another example is an unmanned surface vehicle operating in rough seas that impede the transmission of radio waves, where edge-enabled compute capabilities would enhance resilience and autonomy.

The advent of edge computing could also be a watershed moment for predictive maintenance, which is a central plank of the industry 4.0 model. For instance, we can easily imagine controllers adjusting the manufacturing process dynamically to account for the condition of machine tools, or a battery of sensors monitoring production-line anodes and cathodes and determining when is the optimal time to replace them. In all of these processes, edge computing raises the bar for efficiency.

One of the most promising applications is so-called “space edge computing”, which involves the development of new onboard data-processing capabilities for satellite systems. What are Thales’s ambitions in this field?

Edge computing is of particular relevance to the space sector, where the ability to deploy compute resources in orbit, and to allocate functions to the right components on the fly, can substantially boost satellite efficiency.

In the future, a satellite will be able to run a surveillance application as it flies over the target zone with significantly greater processing power. Meanwhile, edge resource pooling will further optimise satellite on-orbit compute capabilities and enhance mission performance, putting an end to the “one block, one function” paradigm.

We have several space edge computing projects in the pipeline right now. Two of these projects, led by Thales Alenia Space - a joint venture between Thales and Italian company Leonardo - are at an advanced stage. The first aims to deploy a suite of technologies – a computing system, a software framework and high-performance Earth observation sensors – on board the International Space Station, with a view to unlocking new on-orbit data-processing applications.

The second project involves DeeperVision, an Earth observation data analytics application developed in conjunction with Microsoft, which can mass-process satellite imagery in the cloud. Both of these use cases are incredibly promising. But we’re only just starting to explore what edge computing can do!","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.8954726457595825}",neutral,0.8954726457595825,0
Is Thales (EPA:HO) Using Too Much Debt? - Simply Wall St,"Sat, 16 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGx5d2FsbC5zdC9zdG9ja3MvZnIvY2FwaXRhbC1nb29kcy9lcGEtaG8vdGhhbGVzLXNoYXJlcy9uZXdzL2lzLXRoYWxlcy1lcGFoby11c2luZy10b28tbXVjaC1kZWJ0LTTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Legendary fund manager Li Lu (who Charlie Munger backed) once said, 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We note that Thales S.A. ( ) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?

What Risk Does Debt Bring?

Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.

How Much Debt Does Thales Carry?

The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at June 2023 Thales had debt of €4.32b, up from €3.83b in one year. However, it does have €4.93b in cash offsetting this, leading to net cash of €606.9m.

How Healthy Is Thales' Balance Sheet?

We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Thales had liabilities of €21.6b falling due within a year, and liabilities of €6.30b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had €4.93b in cash and €8.97b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling €14.0b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.

Thales has a very large market capitalization of €28.1b, so it could very likely raise cash to ameliorate its balance sheet, if the need arose. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt. While it does have liabilities worth noting, Thales also has more cash than debt, so we're pretty confident it can manage its debt safely.

Also positive, Thales grew its EBIT by 20% in the last year, and that should make it easier to pay down debt, going forward. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Thales can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find to be interesting.

Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. Thales may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Happily for any shareholders, Thales actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT over the last three years. There's nothing better than incoming cash when it comes to staying in your lenders' good graces.

Summing Up

While Thales does have more liabilities than liquid assets, it also has net cash of €606.9m. The cherry on top was that in converted 149% of that EBIT to free cash flow, bringing in €1.6b. So is Thales's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. For instance, we've identified that you should be aware of.

The company also says its forensic latent print identification algorithm uses over 50 percent less computing power than the algorithms submitted by competing vendors, and is more than 50 percent faster than all other submissions to NIST’s Evaluation of Latent Friction Ridge Technology (ELFT).

Lower computing power in combination with higher speed means that Thales’ forensic fingerprint matching algorithm delivers its high accuracy at a lower cost, the company says.

The algorithm’s Detection Error Tradeoff (DET), which NIST describes as it’s “preferred accuracy metric,” has improved by 44 percent, which Thales says reduces the amount of time forensic practitioners must take manually reviewing weak hits.

The 91.9 percent rank-one hit rate for the ThalesCogent+0007 algorithm is based on the Cumulative Match Characteristic metric, as assessed for matching probes with EFS data to an FBI-provided dataset.

Thales scored an 87.4 percent rank-one hit rate with no threshold and no EFS features provided, which ranks third among eight active algorithms assessed.

The company says its Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS) is used in nearly 100 forensic implementations today.

Thales signed a new contract with Land Transport Authority (LTA) in Singapore for the digitalization of the 2 depots on the North-South and East-West Lines (NSEWL).

Thales’ latest generation of advanced interlocking solution will be delivered to modernize the depots.

Singapore’s North-South and East-West Lines extend more than 100 km in length, with 62 stations and 1.4 million daily passengers*. NSEWL are the most heavily utilized rail lines in the MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) network, having served commuters for over three decades.

Thales recently signed a contract with LTA to deploy the latest interlocking solution across 2 large depots for North-South and East-West Lines (NSEWL) in Singapore.

These depots are the two oldest and largest depots across the network. The Bishan Depot was completed in 1986, 37 years ago and the Ulu Pandan Depot was completed in 1988, 35 years ago.

* SMRT website Information Kit (smrt.com.sg)

All the works have to be carried out safely and meticulously, without impacting daily operations in the depots where train movement happens 24x7. Thales’ strong partnership with LTA and SMRT will ensure a continued commuting experience for passengers who rely on these crucial lines for everyday journeys.

In 2012, Thales and SMRT launched a re-signalling project on Singapore's railway backbone, i.e., the North-South and East-West Lines (NSEWL), to convert the legacy fixed block technology to a moving block Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC) system. For the past 10 years, Thales and SMRT have built a strong foundation, embracing local expertise and promoting innovative collaborations. This new contract reinforces this customer trust in Thales to successfully deliver and strengthen the long-term partnership with LTA and SMRT.

“Singapore’s NSEWL is one of the oldest and most complex CBTC modernized lines in the world. Thales is thrilled to continue being part of the digitalisation of 2 depots. By leveraging on cutting-edge SelTrac™ technologies and our extensive expertise, we aim to enhance safety and reliability for improved rail journeys across the globe.” – Alcino De Sousa, Vice-President and Managing Director, Urban Rail Signalling, Thales

“We are proud to continue working with LTA and SMRT. We will continue with our ‘One Team approach’ to collaboratively deliver the project safely, without any impact to passenger commuting on the NSEWL.” – Yu Feng, Ground Transportation Systems Director in Singapore, Thales

The North-South Line is Singapore’s first MRT line. It started operations in November 1987 to connect Yio Chu Kang and Toa Payoh. The East-West Line started in December 1987 as part of the North-South Line, connecting City Hall and Outram stations. By 1990, the East-West Line had grown to reach Boon Lay station in the west. In February 2002, the Changi Airport MRT extension was added. The Tuas West Extension entered service in June 2017 with four new stations that improved accessibility and connectivity for those working in the area. Today, the 57km East-West Line is the longest train line in operation, with a mix of underground and above-ground stations. The MRT network currently comprises six MRT lines with more than 140 stations. Source","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9968637228012085}",positive,0.9968637228012085,1

UK officials gauge long-term defense business ties with Ukraine - Defense News,"Mon, 18 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9nbG9iYWwvZXVyb3BlLzIwMjMvMTIvMTgvdWstb2ZmaWNpYWxzLWdhdWdlLWxvbmctdGVybS1kZWZlbnNlLWJ1c2luZXNzLXRpZXMtd2l0aC11a3JhaW5lL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON — Britain has mounted its first defense trade mission to Ukraine as the government here steps up efforts to secure military business with Kyiv.

The mission saw companies including BAE Systems, Babcock, Thales, KBR and AMS join the British government-led trip to the Ukrainian capital Dec. 13-14.

The British Ministry of Defence said in a statement that the visit will result in additional defense trade missions in 2024.

“The U.K. government and U.K. industry will continue to work hand-in-glove with our Ukrainian allies, seizing opportunities for collaboration and bolstering our defense industries,” Defense Procurement Minister James Cartlidge was quoted as saying.

The trade mission brought together U.K. and Ukrainian government officials along with U.K. and Ukrainian industry executives to discuss opportunities for long-term cooperation.

The industry push comes on the back of weapons support from London that has been growing for months. Fellow European nations are similarly seeking to marry their military support with business growth strategies in the war-torn country, and national heavyweights like Rheinmetall and Thales have been among those pursuing deals with Kyiv.

Initially, those opportunities are principally for the support of the sometimes aging weapons that have poured into Ukraine from Western governments since the Russian invasion started last year. But new weapons system will likely be included too.

BAE announced in August it was setting up an office in Kyiv and looking at the possibility of building and supporting its L119 light gun locally.

Following the trade mission the company went further, announcing it had signed a teaming agreement with support company AMS Integrated Solutions to pursue opportunities maintaining and repairing BAE-built artillery systems in the country.

No mention was made of the type of platforms likely to be involved in the proposal, but the British have donated AS90 155mm tracked howitzers and L119 105mm guns to the Ukrainian military.

The proposal would see AMS use existing maintenance centers in Ukraine, where the company employs local engineers.

AMS already has an agreement with the U.K. MoD to repair platforms in use in Ukraine and has established facilities in country to carry out the work.

Babcock has also set up a local office and last week announced it had been awarded a three-year contract by the Ukrainian MoD to support and maintain two mine countermeasures vessels following their transfer from the U.K. Royal Navy.

The British contractor activities in Ukraine predate the invasion with an agreement involving the two governments and Babcock enhancing Kyiv’s maritime capabilities.

Earlier this year the company secured a £50 million ($63 million), 12-month deal to support operations of Challenger 2 main battle tanks and other armored vehicles donated to Ukrainian forces.

The MoD statement announcing the trade mission also said Thales had signed a memorandum of understanding with Ukrainian unmanned aerial systems business Aerodrone, which involves engineers from the French company’s Northern Ireland operation participating in an unspecified project.

Thales to support Indonesia’s new smart capital city with digital ID and more - Biometric Update,"Tue, 19 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpb21ldHJpY3VwZGF0ZS5jb20vMjAyMzEyL3RoYWxlcy10by1zdXBwb3J0LWluZG9uZXNpYXMtbmV3LXNtYXJ0LWNhcGl0YWwtY2l0eS13aXRoLWRpZ2l0YWwtaWQtYW5kLW1vcmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Indonesia’s new capital, Nusantara, presents ample opportunity for French digital security and defense firm Thales to support smart city initiatives, according to an article in Nikkei Asia.

Thales has already signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Indonesia’s new capital city authority “for strategic cooperation” around the transformation of Nusantara, a planned sustainable metropolis set to replace Jakarta as Indonesia’s capital, with transition slated to begin in August 2024.

According to Olivier Rabourdin, president director at Thales Indonesia, the smart city could present up to $300 million in contractual opportunities. While the European giant is known for its presence in the defense and aerospace sectors, it is increasingly invested in biometrics and digital identity. The MOU with Indonesia specifies that Thales’ collaboration on Nusantara will focus on “development of smart city concepts, including digital identity, traffic management of unmanned aircraft systems, cybersecurity and data centers.”

The plan to move Indonesia’s capital away from Jakarta was hatched in 2019 by President Joko Widodo, AKA Jokowi, who cites concerns about rising sea level, overcrowding and susceptibility to natural disasters as reasons to relocate. According to the New York Times, 40 percent of Jakarta now lies below sea level, as the city sinks due to the proliferation of illegal wells that have drained and deflated the aquifer on which it stands.

Nusantara, on the island of Borneo, is more geographically central to the archipelago of more than 17,000 islands that make up Indonesia, and more sheltered from threats such as volcanoes and floods. While the region is relatively remote, the hope is that the new capital, imagined as a green metropolis run on sustainable energy and aligned towards the nation’s pledge of zero net carbon emissions by 2060, will spur surrounding development.

Thales says development will begin in 2024 on smart city projects for Nusantara, including an automated aircraft traffic control system, disaster management, and measures to solve overcrowding and traffic congestion. The city could be the political swan song for President Widodo, who has prioritized digital public service reforms, as he is prohibited by the constitution from seeking a third term after his current one expires in February of next year. His impending exit has made some foreign firms wary of jumping in on Nusantara in the way Thales has. But, beyond utopian urbanism and the potential for market expansion in Asia, company representatives tell Nikkei there are other factors driving Thales’ interest – namely, the heightened potential for conflict in the South China Sea and surrounding waters, should China decide to test global patience for a fresh round of imperialism.

Thales UK has made a significant leap in championing gender diversity by successfully integrating a cohort of women into their workforce, thanks to their innovative partnership with Code First Girls (CFG). This initiative has not only challenged traditional recruitment norms but has also marked a tangible step toward fostering an inclusive environment in software development.

The Challenge Overcome

Facing a critical need for 3 million skilled workers by 2025, the UK's tech sector has historically seen women represent only 26% of the workforce, with the risk of potential economic growth of £2.6 billion due to gender disparity. Thales UK has embraced the challenge, recognizing the necessity of harnessing this untapped potential.

A New Recruitment Ethos

Thales's collaboration with CFG has set aside conventional recruitment barriers like educational requirements, focusing instead on candidates' technical aptitude, eagerness to learn and behaviours Over the past year, this partnership has carved out and funded 11 spots for women through CFG’s hiring and development program, aiming to cultivate talent in the software engineering realm.

Anna Brailsford, CEO of Code First Girls, emphasizes the importance of the initiative: “Getting women into tech is just the first hurdle - retaining them in the industry and ultimately seeing them lead it are the next ones. With many women coders leaving their roles due to no clear pathway or progression, the MLA course will be fundamental in helping businesses to retain the female tech talent they desperately need.”

The CFG Degree Journey

Following a thorough assessment process by CFG, the candidates embarked on the CFG Degree — a specialized program designed to develop their software engineering skills. Upon graduating in September 2023, Thales honored its pledge by transitioning the successful participants into permanent roles within the company.

Kirsten Booth, Talent, Learning & Culture Specialist at Thales, points out the systemic issues that the partnership seeks to address: “The UK’s education system is failing to support women from more diverse backgrounds into tech. As a result, there remains a lack of female role models in the industry which reinforces the perception that tech is not a realistic career choice for women.""

""In our partnership with Code First Girls, we have seen first-hand the difference that they have on hiring practices, biases, and recruiting on potential and behaviours. Code First Girls’ offers a unique pathway aimed at accelerating women’s careers, which will give women the opportunity to advance and develop their skills, helping them to become role models for other women in the industry.”

Reflecting on Success and Looking Ahead

The successful onboarding of these 11 pioneering individuals marks the culmination of their training and the beginning of their promising careers as software engineers at Thales. This pilot initiative lays the groundwork for expanding this model in the future, aspiring to welcome an even larger intake by 2025 as the supporting infrastructure and processes are enhanced.

Implications for the Future

This accomplishment is a testament to Thales's and CFG’s dedication to actualizing diversity, equity, and inclusion in the tech industry. It highlights the critical role of support and clear career pathways in not only attracting but also retaining women in tech.

Booth adds, “The programme will enable women in tech to mentor and coach female talent, while helping businesses draw on the widest possible range of voices and insights to ensure the tech industry is as strong as it can be.”

By acting on the conviction that a diverse workforce is not only fair but also advantageous, Thales has set a precedent for how tech companies can and should approach recruitment and talent development.

Last year Israel was ranked 10th largest global exporter of weapons. Its technologies are often promoted as being successfully “combat-tested”. For instance, Elbit’s drones have been used for surveillance and attacks in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.

“What you have to understand about weapons in the occupied territories is they’re used to control an entire people,” said Dr Sarmad Akkach. “Freedom of movement is completely controlled through technology that companies like Thales make.”

As the Palestinian death toll exceeded 18,000, Australia voted to support a United Nations ceasefire motion, after stalling for 67 days.

Israel is continuing its indiscriminate air strikes against Palestinians, with United States support.

Achieving a lasting peace will require a break in the military-industrial complex. This year Labor agreed to 52 defence export permits to Israel, while 322 such permits have been approved over the last 6 years.

Palestinian human rights groups have launched proceedings in the Federal Court to expose all arms exports to Israel since October 7.

Justin Tutty from Top End Peace Alliance said that for weapons companies “the humanitarian crisis [in Gaza] is just a business opportunity”. They are expecting to make big profits.

The delegation reminded Thales that it has no social licence to operate.

Peace builders have previously tried to speak to Thales over its sale of Bushmaster vehicles to the Indonesian Special Forces for its repression of West Papuans.

“War crimes start in the corporate boardrooms of Thales and other harms dealers,” human rights advocate Billee McGinley said. “We show up to expose the true nature of their business and to make clear we do not accept them.”

Thales staff blockaded the door with a Christmas tree and refused to talk to the delegation or receive a letter.

The letter called on Thales to immediately release a public statement “confirming any weapons or military equipment used in Gaza”, and to “urgently recall any weapons or military equipment that are being used for war crimes in Gaza”. It also demanded Thales end its “insidious relationship with the Israeli weapons industry” and “retool or move out of Darwin”.

Tutty said the US military build-up is bringing more international weapons companies to the Northern Territory — including Raytheon, Northrup Gruman, Boeing and Lockheed Martin.

“These companies are coming to feed on the error our government is making in buying into America’s plans for a war with China,” Tutty said.

The delegation left disappointed, only to find 7 police cars and approximately 15 officers waiting for them in the car park.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999129772186279}",neutral,0.9999129772186279,0
Thales Alenia Space wins space-based observation contract from Indonesia - Asian Military Review,"Thu, 14 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzaWFubWlsaXRhcnlyZXZpZXcuY29tLzIwMjMvMTIvdGhhbGVzLWFsZW5pYS1zcGFjZS13aW5zLXNwYWNlLWJhc2VkLW9ic2VydmF0aW9uLWNvbnRyYWN0LWZyb20taW5kb25lc2lhL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales and Leonardo joint venture Thales Alenia Space has signed a multi-mission contract with Indonesian state-owned company PT Len Industri to deliver an advanced Earth observation constellation that combines both radar and optical sensors and dedicated to Indonesian Ministry of Defence (MoD) operations.

According to Thales Alenia Space, both companies will contribute to roll out a comprehensive solution comprising space and ground segments in Indonesia.

The constellation will include optical and radar satellites that are integrated and managed using a multi-mission ground segment that involves Leonardo-Thales joint venture Telespazio. The constellation will be operated by PT Len to meet the Indonesian MoD’s requirements for safety and sovereignty.

Meanwhile, PT Len will develop a ground segment system to provide control, maintenance, data processing, and analytic functions for the Defense Satellite System. The company will also enable MoD access to the existing Earth observation satellite constellation via a partnership with BlackSky, which will provide early intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) satellite capability for the MoD and Indonesian Armed Forces prior to the operationalisation of the Defense Satellite System.

“Thales Alenia Space, which has a long history of working with Indonesian satellite operators, is honored to be given the opportunity to work on a crucial program for the Indonesian Defense Ministry for the first time” said Thales Alenia Space CEO Hervé Derrey.

Leveraging our long-standing expertise in Earth observation, we are proud to celebrate a new milestone towards Indonesia’s sovereignty and safety needs, providing a one-of-a-kind integrated optical and radar system,” added Derrey.

“Cooperation between Len and Thales Alenia Space is a positive way to increase our independence in the defence industry,” said Bobby Rasyidin, President-Director of PT Len Industri (Persero).

Thales Alenia Space has a proven track record in delivering space-based capabilities to Indonesia. Earlier in June a new national communications satellite built by the company was successfully launched via a SpaceX Falcon 9 vehicle from Cape Canaveral in Florida.

According to Thales Alenia Space, SATRIA-1 (SAteliT Republik IndonesiA) is a very-high-throughput satellite (VHTS) designed to offer a throughput of 150 Gbps, enabling high speed internet access for military, government and public facilities across the thousands of islands in the Indonesian archipelago not already connected by existing terrestrial or satellite systems.

Chisinau announced in September plans to acquire a Ground Master 200 (GM 200) radar produced by French defense firm Thales. The radar, which can monitor aircraft as far as 250 kilometers (155 miles) away, can also be integrated into an air defense system.

Defence minister Anatolie Nosatii described the radar that Moldova received as vital for strengthening the country’s air defense capabilities.

“The latest incidents when our country’s airspace has been violated have brought back to the authorities’ attention the urgent need to consolidate the Republic of Moldova’s defense capabilities,” he said in the statement.

The price paid for the radar was not provided.

The army of the former Soviet republic of 2.6 million people is equipped with mostly dilapidated equipment dating from the Soviet era.

Since the start of Russia’s offensive in Ukraine last year, tensions between Moscow and Chisinau have sharply increased.

Moldova’s current pro-EU government has condemned the assault against Ukraine and alleged that Russia was behind a plot to try and overthrow it.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.5426653623580933}",negative,0.5426653623580933,-1

Moldova reinforces air defense with French GM200 radar system - AeroTime,"Thu, 21 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm90aW1lLmFlcm8vYXJ0aWNsZXMvbW9sZG92YS1haXItZGVmZW5zZS1mcmFuY2UtdGhhbGVzLXJhZGFy0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYWVyb3RpbWUuYWVyby9hcnRpY2xlcy9tb2xkb3ZhLWFpci1kZWZlbnNlLWZyYW5jZS10aGFsZXMtcmFkYXIvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Moldovan Ministry of Defense announced it had received an air defense radar system from France on December 20, 2023.

In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Moldova, its neighboring nation, has encountered persistent threats to its security. Repeated violations of its airspace have occurred, with cruise missiles launched from Russian warships in the Black Sea targeting Ukrainian cities. Notably, on October 31, 2022, debris from a Russian missile intercepted by Ukrainian air defense fell in the Moldovan village of Naslavcea.

In September 2023, France and Moldova signed an agreement to strengthen military cooperation. One of the main focuses of the bilateral cooperation was to reinforce the air defense capabilities of Moldova.

The first decision was the acquisition of a Ground Master 200 (GM200) multi-mission medium-range radar system, manufactured by the French company Thales, and designed to detect low to high-altitude air targets including missiles, artillery rounds, or drones.

With a surveillance span of 250 kilometers (155 miles), the GM200 can effectively target threats within a 100-kilometer (62-mile) range when integrated with an air defense system like the Aster 30 SAMP/T (also known as MAMBA). This same equipment was supplied to Ukraine by France to reinforce the nation’s defense against Russia.

The GM200 radar has now been received by the Moldovan National Army, the country’s Ministry of Defense has reported.

“In the current security context, the safety of our citizens is a priority. The latest incidents of violation of our country’s airspace have brought back to the authorities the urgent need to strengthen the defense capabilities of the Republic of Moldova. This system, dedicated to monitoring the entire airspace of the country, marks the culmination of a series of measures undertaken to equip the National Army in accordance with international standards.” Moldovan Minister of Defense Anatolie Nosatîi

Currently, the Moldovan Air Force faces limited capabilities to deal with an air threat, attributed to its modest size and budgetary constraints. Operating a limited fleet of Soviet-manufactured aircraft, including helicopters and transport planes, Moldova’s President Maia Sandu has persistently urged NATO nations to provide her country with air defense systems.

Moldova: Putin’s next target?

Moldova is additionally concerned about its sovereignty, with the Russian military presence in the separatist region of Transnistria intensifying the threat.

During a speech to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in late November 2023, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused NATO and the EU of thwarting Russian efforts aimed at resolving the conflict between the Dniester Republic and Moldova.

“Moldova is essentially being readied as the next victim in the hybrid war that the West unleashed against Russia.” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov

Ukrainian and Moldovan intelligence fear that Russian forces may seize Chisinau International Airport (KIV) to use as a base for attacking Moldova and western Ukraine. This tactic, reminiscent of the 1968 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia capturing Prague Airport (PRG), was also attempted near Kyiv at Hostomel Airport (GML) during Russia’s initial offensive on Ukraine, resulting in the destruction of the Antonov An-225 Mriya, the world’s largest aircraft.

Moldovan Foreign Minister Nicu Popescu disclosed in a TV interview that authorities have been prepared to sabotage the airport runway since the start of the Ukraine invasion.

As part of ongoing initiatives to strengthen Moldova’s defense, various EU member states have committed to supporting and fortifying the nation’s limited ground forces. Germany, for example, has recently provided Moldova with Piranha III armored personnel carriers acquired from Denmark. France is also playing an active role there, delivering an initial batch of military aid to Chisinau in November 2023. This package, transported by a French Air and Space Force A400M transport aircraft, encompassed individual equipment, infantry weapons, and ammunition.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9840971231460571}",neutral,0.9840971231460571,0
The Trial of the Thales 3 - The Glasgow Guardian,"Sat, 02 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vZ2xhc2dvd2d1YXJkaWFuLmNvLnVrLzIwMjMvMTIvMDIvdGhlLXRyaWFsLW9mLXRoZS10aGFsZXMtMy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Glasgow Guardian reports on the three activists from Palestine Action who stood trial last week following the destruction of £1.5 million worth of equipment at the Thales Group factory in Glasgow last year.

On 11 July 2022, members of Palestine Action occupied and dismantled the Thales Group factory in the south of Glasgow. Thales Group, one of the largest weapons manufacturers in the world, produces machinery used for defence and security purposes. One of these weapons, The Watchkeeper drone, has been built in collaboration with Elbit Systems, an Israel-based weapons company, and has been used to monitor populations in Iraq, Palestine, and Afghanistan.

The team who took part in this operation “[forced] workers to evacuate, [prevented] site operations and [… damaged] site facilities,” causing an alleged £1.5 million in damages. What Palestine Action argues is that the destruction these weapons would have caused to Palestinians’ lives is incomparable.

As a result, three members of this operation stood trial on the week beginning Monday 20 November at Glasgow Sheriff Court on charges of “malicious mischief” and “reckless endangerment”. In response, every morning last week, supporters of the Thales 3 have organised a show of solidarity for the defendants to be held outside Glasgow Sheriff Court.

Since 20 November, crowds of 20 to 60 people have shown up to distribute tea, coffee and free food, and provided facepaint and banners. Organisers of “Shut Thales Down” have also instructed that demonstrators put flags away and remain respectful when going into the courtroom, to allow a fair trial for the defendants.

Participants in this demonstration agreed to speak to The Glasgow Guardian about Thales Group, the trial of the Thales 3, and the work being done to support them.

“What we’re arguing for is that [Thales] is committing the crime in the first place by selling the weapons to Israel,” an anonymous 21-year-old medical student from the University of Glasgow argued. When asked about what they saw as the best outcome for this trial, they believed that it would be if the jury realised “that [the morality] is more important than [the crime]” adding: “If they don’t […] and these three people go to jail and Thales gets away scot-free that’s disgusting and inhumane.”

When asked if they wished to send a message to any activists, they told The Glasgow Guardian: “to all the people who feel like they can’t do anything, you’re probably right you can’t do anything individually, but finding people you can do things with will take you much further.”

This feeling of hope and optimism has been reflected throughout many of the supporters of the Thales 3, with chants such as “I believe that we will win” being repeated throughout the week.

In an incredibly emotive speech, one organiser of Shut Thales Down appealed to the crowd to “[build] relationships with each other in all communities”, to show up to demonstrations and forge solidarity. They also spoke about the importance of “taking direction from the global majority”, learning from each other and “from Palestinian resistance and Black liberation [in order to understand] our interconnected struggles.”

Many other speeches that were held over the week also spoke of solidarity, the importance of community and of learning from each other. I talked to a speaker who was one of the organisers of Shut Thales Down. They agreed to speak but chose to remain anonymous to maintain their non-hierarchical approach to organising. When asked about their beliefs on the importance of learning from others, they spoke about how “we’re learning a lot from past movements […] and we have to understand what came before us and what came after us to actually mobilise in this moment of genocide.”

An emphasis on mutual aid and solidarity within and between communities was a key theme throughout the week. When asked about what groups such as Shut Thales Down could learn from other movements happening in Palestine, as well as in the Congo and Sudan, they told The Glasgow Guardian: “we don’t know everything, but there are plenty of comrades from the Congo, from Sudan […] they have the answers […] we need to work together because together we have the answers”.

It was hard to ignore how intertwined the trial of the Thales 3 and the ongoing genocide in Palestine were. Throughout the week people handed out watermelon slices (a symbol of national identity and resistance in Palestine) and Palestinian songs were played from loudspeakers as supporters danced and sang. “Having people show up makes us hopeful that we’re on the right side of history”, one of the organisers told The Glasgow Guardian. “Palestinians are teaching us life right now…They still find hope and resistance to fight back […] it’s almost like, how dare we be hopefully here when they are over there”.

This case has taken over a year to be brought to trial, after the defendants previously stood in court for four days beginning on 9 August 2023. Issues with the jury, as well as court dates being extended, has meant it has taken over a year for a verdict to be reached. One of the defendants, Cat Scothorne, a 20-year-old student from Glasgow University, spoke to The Glasgow Guardian about their thoughts on coming into the trial: “I’ve done trial before but this is definitely the highest consequence one so I was quite nervous as I would really like to continue my final year [at university] but I will have to drop out if I get custody for this”.

During this trial, Cat has been faced with both charges of “malicious mischief” and “reckless endangerment” due to the actions of the defendants at Thales. “We were all agreed that we wanted to cause damage of some kind because there is a difference between occupying a factory […] and actually disabling it […] we wanted to be as effective as possible.” Whilst perhaps these charges are not a surprise due to the defendants’ roles in the destruction of £1.5 million worth of machinery, Cat felt as if the principle of what they were doing appeared much more important: “When somebody drops a bomb on civilians somebody has […] ordered that bomb to be dropped and somebody has made a profit […] I read about Thales, and I couldn’t believe they were on our doorstep […] and so [I knew] something had to be done.”

On the discussion of the charges, Cat felt optimistic that they wouldn’t be found guilty of “reckless endangerment”, however, felt less optimistic on the charges of “malicious mischief”: “I don’t think people [the jury] are at that point yet to go against what Sheriff is telling [them] to do,” Cat explained. “There seems to be quite a lot of trust in law and order here [in Scotland] which is sad […] we might not be found guilty of the second charge (reckless endangerment) […] the evidence is in our favour.”

“I’d be happy to do lots of community service […] I wouldn’t even mind getting an ankle tag […] I’d be happy with anything other than custody,” Cat responded when asked about what they could see as the result of the case. “I’ve got this presentation due on resistance to borders for history and it would be so perfect if I had an ankle tag for the presentation just to prove the point.”

As of Tuesday 28 November, the Thales 3 were found not guilty of reckless endangerment, and guilty to malicious endangerment. They now await sentencing on 23 January 2024.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9957318902015686}",neutral,0.9957318902015686,0

The GM 200, a medium-range tactical air defense radar manufactured by Thales, was chosen as part of Moldova's efforts to modernize its air defense capabilities.

As a reminder, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Moldova gained its independence in 1991. Since then, the country has oscillated between a Western European orientation and historical and cultural ties with Russia. This duality is reflected in its politics, economy, and international relations.

A key element of Moldova's geostrategic dynamics is the frozen conflict in Transnistria, a separatist region in the east of the country, supported by Russia. This situation creates ongoing tension and raises security and stability concerns for Moldova.

Moldova has expressed its interest in moving closer to the European Union, as evidenced by its association agreement with the EU. However, Russia remains an important economic and energy partner, and relations with Moscow continue to be a significant factor in Moldovan politics.

These geopolitical dynamics directly influence Moldova's defense policy. The need to protect its territorial integrity and navigate a complex regional environment makes it essential for Moldova to strengthen its defense and surveillance capabilities. The acquisition of advanced defense systems like Thales' GM-200 radar is a response to these security imperatives.

Ground Master 200 radar systems have also been supplied to Georgia in 2015 and to Ukraine in 2023. Designed to conduct multiple missions simultaneously, they include aerial and surface surveillance, target designation for ground-based air defense (GBAD) systems, as well as detection and alert of rocket, artillery, and mortar threats. The radar can also detect unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) flying at low altitudes, small and slow.

The system is designed for uninterrupted operation with a 24-hour autonomy package, ensuring continuous surveillance. It includes a certified Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system with Mode 5 certification, enhancing situational awareness and reducing the risk of misidentification in complex air defense scenarios.

The Ground Master 200 excels in detection performance, capable of tracking a wide range of threats such as aircraft, missiles, ships, UAVs, and helicopters with different profiles. It features sensors suited to GBAD systems and an 8-meter-high antenna, offering a clear view and extended time on target while minimizing interference.

Deployment and operation are facilitated with this system, which comes in a single 20-foot ISO package and features a truck-mounted configuration, allowing rapid deployment in 15 minutes. It can be operated by just two people with minimal training.

The system offers easy integration into existing command and control (C2) and GBAD systems, as it is already integrated with more than 10 such systems worldwide. It includes a Health Usage Monitoring System (HUMS) and predictive maintenance features, ensuring operational reliability, and is supported in 25 countries, indicating its international compatibility. The Ground Master 200 has demonstrated its effectiveness in various operational theaters, including extreme climate conditions, with over 60 systems deployed.

In terms of detection capabilities, the radar covers a surveillance range of up to 250 km and an engagement range of 100 km. It can detect and track targets at altitudes of up to 80,000 feet (24,384 m) with an elevation coverage of 70 degrees and tracks targets with speeds ranging from 15 to 1,200 m per second.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999444305896759}",neutral,0.999444305896759,0

Eastern Bank will soon launch biometric metal cards using Idex Pay technology, while Thales is ready to deploy its next generation of biometric cards featuring the T2 sensor module from Fingerprint Cards.

Idex and Eastern Bank to launch biometric metal cards

Fingerprint biometrics provider Idex Biometrics has revealed an agreement with Bangladesh-based Eastern Bank (EBL) to launch what Idex claims is the first biometric metal card to market.

Among those present at the signing event were Ali Reza Iftekhar, managing director and CEO of EBL and Catharina Eklof, CCO of Idex.

“EBL’s premium customers will be the first group to receive these new contactless cards, as EBL again takes the lead on driving seamless payments across Bangladesh and Asia,” says Eklof in the announcement.

Idex announced in November that it received an initial order for biometric metal cards from an Asian smart card manufacturer, though it did not name the entity.

Fingerprint Cards sensor powers next-generation Thales card

The Thales Gemalto biometric payment card, featuring the T2 fingerprint sensor and biometric payment software platform from Fingerprint Cards, is ready to be deployed globally.

Fingerprint Cards has shipped more than one million T2 sensor module units, which are part of its FPC1300-series.

The sensor uses dual row packaging and can be integrated through standard automated manufacturing processes, optimizing production speed and capacity. The card is also encrypted. This is the fourth generation of the Gemalto card.

Users enroll their fingerprint using a calibration reader that comes with the card. Once enrolled, no one will be able to use the card for purchases except the owner. Fingerprints can also be deleted from the card.

Blockade the harms dealers who are making a killing from genocide!

On Tuesday December 5th join the people of Bendigo at the gates of the Thales weapons factory in Finn St. It's time to shut this factory down.

What to bring: Food, water and songs to share. Picnic rugs and cushions and shade structures for comfort. Your friends, workmates, parents and kids. Wheelbarrows, trolleys, ladders and other gardening gear. (Don't bring tools that that could be construed as weapons!) Music equipment and instruments, toys and games. We are here for at least a day, maybe more.

What to expect: a peaceful exercise of our right to protest, our right to peace and our solidarity with the people being harmed by Australian made weapons right now.

Thales is a multi-billion $$ French weapons maker, currently partnering with Israeli companies ELBIT and Israeli Aerospace Industries. Thales and ELBIT own UAV Tactical, making killer drones for export and for use in the UK and Israel. The Thales / IAI partnership has produced the 'Sea Serpent', a surface-to-surface guided missile with a kill range of 200 kilometres. Thales is one of the richest weapons corporations in the world and they are manufacturing weapons and surveillance technology right here in Victoria.

The Thales factory in Bendigo produces the Bushmaster weaponised vehicles, which they sell to the notorious Indonesian special forces KOPASSUS. Australia has signed 50 export licenses to Israel just in 2023. Are weapons made in Bendigo being used in Palestine?

Thales, ELBIT and IAI are in the business of genocide. Their profits are our losses. Maiming and killing the people of Gaza is their product. Dispossession and displacement are their bottom line. War crimes start in corporate boardrooms, in the offices of Thales and other harms dealers. We are joining the people of Bendigo to tell Thales to retool. Make wheelbarrows not warheads. Drop seeds not bombs. Grow forests not profits.

With NASA gearing up to send humans back to the moon in the next few years with the Artemis missions with the goal of establishing a permanent outpost at the lunar south pole, nations are making efforts to contribute to Artemis and a permanent presence on our nearest celestial neighbor.

Recently, the Italian Space Agency, formally known as Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI), has taken steps to establish the first permanent outpost on the lunar surface, known simply as the Multi-Purpose Habitat (MPH). This endeavor was officially kicked by the ASI signing a contract with the French-based aerospace company, Thales Alenia Space, who specializes in space-based systems, including ground segments and satellites used for both Earth observation and space exploration.

""MPH will mark a historic milestone as the first Italian habitation module to operate on the lunar surface. This is a matter of great pride for our company, which has the unique technical and organizational skills to overcome challenges of this kind,"" Franco Fenoglio, who is the Manager of Human & Robotic Planetary Exploration Program at Thales Alenia Space, said in an official statement. Thales also announced the partnership on its X account, formerly known as Twitter.

Despite MPH being only a concept right now, the partnership between ASI and Thales Alenia Space comes after MPH's design passed NASA's Element Initiation Review just last month and with a Mission Concept Review (MCR) slated to be conducted sometime in the first quarter of 2024. The goal of MPH will be its compatibility with Artemis architecture for future lunar crewed missions.

The image provided by Thales Alenia Space of its MPH shows a very simple design comprised of a single cylinder complete with solar panels and a communications dish. However, this module will be required to protect astronauts from the harsh lunar environment, including intense cosmic radiation and the lunar surface's extreme temperature fluxes, as temperatures at the lunar equator can reach 121°C (250°F) during the day and -133°C (-208°F).

However, temperatures are especially important at the lunar south pole, which is the target landing site for the Artemis missions, as parts of these regions experience either constant sunlight or constant darkness. For example, data from NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter has indicated that temperatures in the darkest craters at the poles are lower than -246°C (-410°F). Therefore, MPH's design and construction will have to account for these much lower temperatures, as well.

Founded in 2007, Thales Alenia Space has a long and rich history of space-based activities, as it is the second largest industrial participant in the International Space Station (ISS), with Boeing being the largest. This participation includes building several pressurized ISS modules such as Harmony, Tranquility, Columbus Laboratory Module, Leonardo, and the Cupola, the last of which is comprised of the large windows where the astronauts conduct Earth observations.

This most recent development for the MPH continues a long-standing partnership between ASI and NASA, as ASI has sent a total of seven astronauts to space starting with STS-46 in 1992 and most recently with SpaceX Crew-4 in 2022. Additionally, Italy became an official participant in the Artemis Accords, which they signed in 2020.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999840259552002}",neutral,0.9999840259552002,0

The deal was made possible thanks to an agreement reached with the sponsoring employer, Thales, which secured an upfront cash commitment from Thales.



As part of the insurance premium Rothesay also accepted a number of illiquid assets, held in the scheme’s investment portfolio.



Thales was advised by the lead transaction adviser, PwC, and Allen & Overy, and Rothesay received legal advice from Travers Smith. The scheme trustee, meanwhile, was advised by Gowling WLG, Mercer and Momentum.



Commenting on the deal, chair of trustees, Peter Rowley, stated: “We are delighted to have secured long-term security for all our pension scheme members in a single buy-in transaction.



""We are grateful to our sponsor for making this buy-in achievable and to our advisers and Rothesay for their collaborative efforts to execute what was a complex transaction.”



Adding to this, Thales UK director of compensation and benefits, Paul Durrant, said: ""This has been an important transaction to the sponsor where we have had to work through a number of new challenges and are therefore pleased that we have been able to secure the pension benefits of over 16,000 current and past employees.



“The advisory teams as well as Rothesay have skilfully navigated the complexities involved in this transaction, quickly finding optimal solutions where needed and completing it in a short space of time.



“This is a hugely successful outcome for us and helps us to meet our corporate objectives.”



This was echoed by Mercer risk transfer partner, Ben Stone, who said: ""In a very busy insurer market the effort put in by all parties over recent weeks to make this transaction happen has been phenomenal.



""This demonstrates again that large, complex transactions can complete successfully with clear objectives for all parties to work towards.”



PwC head of pension deals, Swapnil Katkar, also described the deal as the ""culmination of significant work by all parties"", stating that ""in an increasingly buoyant and competitive market, we are thrilled to reach a successful outcome for the scheme, its members and Thales.”



Indeed, Rothesay head of business development, Sammy Cooper-Smith, agreed that 2023 has been one of ""busiest ever years"" for the pension risk transfer market, pointing out that ""2024 is already looking incredibly exciting for our market with an unprecedented pipeline as an even greater number of schemes seek insurance solutions"".

"EDEX 2023 - Egyptian AIO shows new products based on uncooled thermal sensors, leveraging its skills in the optical ... - EDR Magazine","Mon, 11 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lZHJtYWdhemluZS5ldS9lZ3lwdGlhbi1haW8tc2hvd3MtbmV3LXByb2R1Y3RzLWJhc2VkLW9uLXVuY29vbGVkLXRoZXJtYWwtc2Vuc29ycy1sZXZlcmFnaW5nLWl0cy1za2lsbHMtaW4tdGhlLW9wdGljYWwtZG9tYWlu0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paolo Valpolini

Arab International Optronic, AIO in short, the joint venture between the Egyptian Ministry of Defence and Thales, the latter controlling 49% of the shares, introduced at EDEX a series of new systems, ranging from portable optics to a new Fire Control System (FCS), all based on uncooled thermal sensors coupled to high quality lenses designed and produced thanks to the company skills in optic construction

Born in the mid-1980s, AIO facility is located on the outskirts of Cairo, at El-Salam City, the complex covering over 87,000 m2, a considerable size for a company working on relatively small systems.

Discussing the new FCS what immediately raised our attention was the fact that while most of those systems have a thermal channel based on cooled sensors working in the mid-wave infrared, the AIO proposal comes with an uncooled sensor, which typically has a much shorter recognition range.

The surprise did not lasted long, as in the company booth two other long-range uncooled thermal imagers were visible, which led EDR On-Line talking to an expert present on site who explained us that the Egyptian company developed high-tech skills in the optical domain, optics being a key element when you need to increase the range of an uncooled sensor. EDR On-Line understood that while the increase of the diameter of the lens in cooled thermal imagers is linear with the range increase, when talking of uncooled sensors this becomes quadratic, hence the lens becomes very quickly huge, which needs considerable skills to design and manufacture it. According to our source, who was not part of AIO, the Egyptian-based JV has those competencies and skills as well as the needed facilities, the El-Salam City factory featuring 600 m2 of white chambers for critical optronic assembly operations.

It is to note that soon the Lucie night vision goggles (NVGs), designed by Thales and until now produced in France, will be manufactured at the AIO plant, the transfer of technology being currently underway. The NVGs will be slightly modified, the overall aim being to have a less expensive product with same characteristics in order to open up new markets, while Thales will concentrate higher-end products, mostly binoculars, EDR On-Line understood.

Back to the 100% Egyptian new FCS, known as Striker, this is made of gunner’s optronic unit, a commander’s thermal sight, a driver’s thermal sight, a meteorological station, a munitions temperature sensor, a target speed sensor, a vehicle cant angle sensor, and a gun cant angle sensor. All those systems are linked to a fire control computer allowing upgrading existing functionalities and the addition of new ones. As standard the computer is filled with ballistic tables for six different types of ammunition, however two more can added on request if needed.

Starting from the gunner’s thermal channel, this is based on a 17 µm pitch 640×512 uncooled sensor working in the 8-14 µm band, fitted with a lens with variable focal length from 30 to 180 mm. This provides a wide field of view (FoV) of 14.6°x1.7° and a narrow FoV of 2.4°x2°, with a 4,000 metres reconnaissance range against tanks. Two day channels are available, a wide field one based on a 1280×1024 pixels CMOS sensor fitted with a 30 mm focal length optic providing an 11.7°x9.4° FoV and a 1,100 metres reconnaissance range. This is of 4 km for the narrow field channel, which is based on a 4096×3000 pixels CMOS coupled to a 110 mm focal length optic, providing a 7.4°x5.4° FoV. A Class 1 laser rangefinder operating on the 1.54 µm frequency is also fitted, with a 1 Hz pulse repetition frequency providing a ± 2 metres accuracy. Maximum range is not provided, but is definitely in excess of the optics reconnaissance range. Looking at the optronic module from the front, we find the thermal channel on the left, with the bigger diameter optic; moving to the right, in the lower part e find the wide FoV day channel, followed by the laser rangefinder, over which we can see the lens of the daylight narrow FoV channel.

The Striker’s commander’s thermal channel is fitted in a separate housing and is based on a 640×480 pixels uncooled sensors with a 17 µm pitch, coupled to an 88 mm fixed focal length giving a 7.1°x5.3° FoV and recognition ranges against vehicles and humans of respectively 1,200 and 600 metres.

As for the other sensors, the meteorological station can measure wind speed in the 0-65 m/s range from all directions, ambient temperature between -40°C and +70°C, and atmospheric pressure from 300 to 1,100 millibars. The ammo temperature sensor operates in the -10°C/+60°C range with a ± 0.5°C accuracy. Cant angle sensors operate respectively in the ±30° range that of the gun and in the ±15° range the vehicle one. As for the target speed sensors, this operates at 2500 impulse per cycle rate.

The system also includes a thermal camera for the driver. Also uncooled, no data being provided on the sensor, it gives a 40°x30° FoV, the image being seen on an 8.4 inch display, operating ranges being 1 to 150 metres.

The Striker FCS seen at EDEX 2023 was a system prototype. Tests have already started with the Egyptian Army that will lead to the system qualification. AIO considers there is considerable market for its new FCS. No more details were provided but EDR On-Line understood that considerable quantities might be needed by the national customer, probably for upgrading part of its older tanks still in active service. However AIO representatives considered the new product a solution not only for main battle tanks but also for infantry fighting vehicles.

Beside the new Striker FCS, in the AIO stand the visitor could see two more long-range thermal systems. The first one was the D88 binocular model featuring the same sensor of the FCS commander’s sight coupled to a 150 mm lens with a 1.15 aperture providing a 4.2°x3.1° FoV, a x2 and x4 electronic zoom. With a minimal focus distance of 25 metres, the D88 uncooled thermal imager long-range binocular is 330 mm long, 150 mm wide and high, and weighs less than 2.5 kg without batteries, 18650 3.7V/3,000 mAh batteries being used, the system having a 2 W nominal power consumption. The image is displayed on a 800×600 AMOLED SVGA display, where digital reticle patterns can be injected according to customer’s requirements. Detection, recognition and identification against vehicles (2.3 metres size) and humans (0.75 metres), are respectively 10.3/3,5 km, 3.4/1.1 km, and 1.7/0.55 km.

The second long range thermal imager is designed to be integrated in surveillance and aiming systems. Known as Z50, it is also based on an uncooled sensor. This is however one of the latest generations, as it has a 1280×1024 pixels matrix, which is a super VGA standard, with a 12 µm pitch. The cylinder sight has a 165 mm diameter and is 252.5 mm long, weighs 4.2 kg and is fitted with a 120 mm focal length athermal lens with a 1:1 aperture providing a 7-3°x5.8° FoV. The standard user interface is a 13.3 inch full HD display. Detection, recognition and identification against vehicles and humans are respectively 7/3 km, 3/1 km, and 1.9/0.6 km.

The adoption of uncooled sensors in the aforementioned systems has a series of advantages in terms of wake-up time, cost and weight, no cooling machine is needed, while on the negative side dimensions are greater due to the bigger lens needed to reach the same range. Performances reached by AIO products provide however an alternative for long range surveillance and reconnaissance.

This morning [11 December], local action groups and citizens gathered outside BAE Systems’ facility in Govan to protest the multinational’s links to Israel and demand that it ceases all weapons, defence and supplies trading with the state.

The company produces components and equipment for the F-35 jet, the main warplane being used in the bombing of Gaza, as well as the Mk 38 Mod 2 machine gun which Israel also uses.

Protestors led chants and waved Palestinian flags outside the staff entrance to the facility from 7am in what was a peaceful morning; chants and speeches were only cut through by the sound of cars honking their horns in support of the movement.

“More and more people are supporting the Palestinian cause as the genocide wears on,” said one of the organisers. “We’ve only had one guy heckle us today!”

The marchers also made their way half a mile down the road to the nearby Thales factory. Thales is an arms manufacturer, providing military drones, armoured vehicles, missile systems and more, including to Israel.

In 2022, members of Palestine Action Scotland scaled its walls before causing damage to the roof, forcing staff to evacuate. Last month, three of the protesters were tried in court and found guilty of malicious damage (they were found not guilty of culpable and reckless conduct) and await sentencing early in the new year.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9916515946388245}",neutral,0.9916515946388245,0

SNP Government accused of snubbing Glasgow 'success story' Thales which won Westminster contract - Scottish Daily Express,"Sat, 16 Dec 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjb3R0aXNoZGFpbHlleHByZXNzLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvcG9saXRpY3Mvc25wLWdvdmVybm1lbnQtYWNjdXNlZC1zbnViYmluZy1nbGFzZ293LTMxNjg5MDc40gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2NvdHRpc2hkYWlseWV4cHJlc3MuY28udWsvbmV3cy9wb2xpdGljcy9zbnAtZ292ZXJubWVudC1hY2N1c2VkLXNudWJiaW5nLWdsYXNnb3ctMzE2ODkwNzguYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Scottish Government's snub of a Glasgow ""success story"" has been blasted after no officials contacted Thales after it won a huge contract with the UK Government. The defence firm has been based in Scotland for decades and builds parts for the Royal Navy.

In July the company, which also has a site in Rosyth, was awarded a massive £169m contract by BAE Systems to build a new periscope for the Royal Navy’s next generation Dreadnought Class submarine. This move will sustain more than 150 engineering and support jobs across the UK, mainly at its site in Glasgow.

Scotland Secretary Alister Jack welcomed this at the time, as he pointed out the importance of Thales to Scotland's economy. He said: “With more than a century’s experience of building periscopes and optronic masts for our submarines, it’s great news that Thales’ Glasgow workforce will once again be at the forefront of producing the state-of-the-art combat system mast for our round the clock nuclear deterrent.

“Defence plays a crucial part in the security of the United Kingdom and also contributes significantly to delivering high-skilled jobs and investment in Scotland.”

But while the UK Government lavished praise on Thales, the SNP Executive was silent on any sorts of congratulations publicly. And now the Scottish Daily Express can reveal that the two organisations have not shared any correspondence all year, despite the success.

Nationalist ministers have been quick to applaud Scottish companies such as Ferguson Marine who win contracts, but failed to do so here. There were also no briefings prepared for the government about Thales, and no meetings were held between them either.

It has led to criticism from one proud Glasgow MSP in Scottish Tory Annie Wells who pointed out that it was ""deeply disappointing"" that the SNP had failed to show its appreciation for such a big contributor to the city's economy. She told the Scottish Daily Express: “As a Glaswegian and a MSP representing the city, I am always proud to highlight the incredible success story of Thales.

“It is deeply disappointing that it looks as though the SNP are not prepared to do likewise. Thales has highlighted the benefits of Scotland being part of the UK with the awarding of defence contracts worth hundreds of millions in recent years.

""The work being carried out by employees in Govan has arguably never been so important given the aggression shown by Russia in Ukraine in particular SNP ministers are always quick to ramp up their grievance machine when they try and spin apparent broken promises on defence, but when there is a UK success story, they are unsurprisingly radio silent.”

Thales employs over 700 people across its two main sites in Glasgow and Rosyth and invests a huge amount of money in Scotland, including over £170m in 2017 alone, while also supporting a supply chain. Engineers build complex electro-optical systems for land, air, and sea.

Generations of Glasgow-based engineers have been manufacturing periscopes at the Clyde factory for more than 100 years, with every Royal Navy submarine in service since 1917 fitted with a Thales periscope or optronics mast. The current Royal Navy submarines of Vanguard Class, Astute Class and Trafalgar Class are all fitted with Glasgow-manufactured masts.

A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: “Through the New Deal for Business Group, we will continue to work with businesses to deliver a wellbeing economy, creating the best possible place for business, people and planet. The Scottish Government has repeatedly condemned Russia’s illegal war against Ukraine and stands in solidarity with the people of Ukraine.”
