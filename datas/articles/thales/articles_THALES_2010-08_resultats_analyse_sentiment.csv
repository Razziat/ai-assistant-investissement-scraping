Thale'S Submarine Distress Beacon For Royal Navy - MarineLink,"Wed, 18 Aug 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmluZWxpbmsuY29tL25ld3Mvc3VibWFyaW5lLWRpc3RyZXNzLXRoYWxlczMzNTI0NdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales UK’s highly successful submarine distress beacon has been accepted into service with the Royal Navy (RN). Following a trial period, more than 100 SEEPIRB (submarine-ejected emergency positioning indicating radio beacon) buoys have been accepted into service with all classes of RN submarines, including the new Astute class.



The SEEPIRB has been developed for submarines to provide distress alerting and position information via radio transmissions on a satellite-aided tracking frequency. The message transmitted by the beacon is unique for each unit, thus providing identification of the transmitter. Once the search and rescue forces are alerted via the satellite-aided tracking network, they can converge on the confirmed position. Inter¬mediate and short-range location is aided by the SEEPIRB’s onboard locator beacon.



SEEPIRB can be launched from standard submerged signal ejectors (SSE) Mk 4, 6, 8 and 10. Launching can take place at maximum operational depth and submerged speeds of up to 15kt. No programming of the SEEPIRB is required. The alert func¬tions, and the vessel and country identifiers are pre-programmed into the beacon as agreed with each customer.



Phil Naybour, head of Thales UK’s naval business, says: “Since winning the RN contract, we have won several additional export contracts and continue to see an increasing interest from around the world in this excellent product.”



The buoy, which is designed and produced at Thales’s Templecombe site in Somerset, is already in service with a number of submarine fleets around the world.

British Army uses laser dazzlers to save lives - WIRED,"Mon, 09 Aug 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiJ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpcmVkLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9nbG93LWxhc2VyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A laser has become a vital weapon in the British Army's operations in Afghanistan. It doesn't burn its target to a cinder; in fact, its function is saving lives. The Green Laser Optical Warner, or GLOW, made by Thales is used to stop anyone approaching a checkpoint or patrol. Unusually for a weapon, the safety of the target is a key design consideration.

Weighing about a kilo, GLOW is a lot chunkier than your average laser pointer, but the effective range of over three hundred metres is more than most laser pointers too. GLOW fits under the barrel of a rifle, and is described as an ""escalation of force option"", providing an intermediate step between shouting at someone to stop and shooting at them. The brilliant light will get anyone's attention whatever language they speak, and the dazzle effect will prevent most people from moving forward. GLOW has wide and narrow beam settings.

""The narrow beam diameter is around half a meter at fifty metres, wide beam will fill a car windscreen,"" says Denise Clarke, Communications Director at Thales. A Pulse setting causes the beam to flash, making it even more noticeable.

According to a company spokesperson, British forces have used GLOW in at least 20 confrontations when lethal force might otherwise have been employed, potentially preventing an innocent person from being shot in every case. Every time someone is shot, and the likelihood of attacks on British forces increases, making non-lethal devices like GLOW an essential tool for this type of conflict.

US forces have been using laser dazzlers in Iraqand Afghanistan for years, but safety considerations were low on the list of priorities. Initially, some US soldiers simply bought their own high-powered laser pointers, or used lasers supplied for other tasks such as designating targets for airstrikes. But such lasers may not be eye safe and can cause injuries -- there have been a number of reports of US troops being hospitalised with eye injuries following careless use of dazzlers, and there may be many more unreported cases among local people. Being blinded may be better than being shot, but permanent eye damage is not going to improve anyone's attitude towards foreign troops.

One of the lasers used by US forces is the GBD-III made by Meyers, which has a Nominal Ocular Hazard Distance (NOHD) of almost a mile, meaning that it is potentially hazardous at shorter ranges. While American forces are now using less powerful lasers, even the latest GLARE MOUT lasers ordered by the US Marine Corps have an NOHD of almost thirty metres.

By contrast, GLOW has a Nominal Ocular Hazard Distance of less than 10 metres, so you would have to be that close before there was any risk. Even within that range it has been designed to minimise the risk of permanent damage, and it's the first laser to get legal, medical and ethical clearance with the Ministry of Defence. GLOW has two independent safety systems which ensure the output is within the required levels.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9994944334030151}",neutral,0.9994944334030151,0
"UK approaches Airbus Military, Thales for A400M training service - Flightglobal","Fri, 06 Aug 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vdWstYXBwcm9hY2hlcy1haXJidXMtbWlsaXRhcnktdGhhbGVzLWZvci1hNDAwbS10cmFpbmluZy1zZXJ2aWNlLzk1MjI2LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The UK Ministry of Defence has outlined a more than £400 million ($637 million) requirement for a synthetic training service to support operations with its future fleet of Airbus Military A400M transports.

Expected to be contracted under a public-private partnership funding arrangement, the A400M training service deal should run until at least March 2030, according to details released by the UK’s Defence Equipment & Support organisation.

“The UK is seeking the provision of an A400M synthetic training service for all military personnel who will operate, maintain and support the aircraft,” it says in a 3 August notification. This will include pilots, loadmasters and maintainers, plus “aerial despatch and aero-medical personnel, paratroopers and miscellaneous support staff.”

New training premises will be constructed at the Royal Air Force’s main operating base for the A400M at Brize Norton in Oxfordshire as a result of the programme.

© Andrew Linnett/Crown Copyright The A400M made its first visit to RAF Brize Norton last month

The MoD in mid-July issued an invitation to negotiate to Airbus Military and its selected UK partner, Thales Training and Simulation for the proposed deal. An expression of interest is required by 29 October, with DE&S due to sign a contract in October 2011.

The UK had been due to acquire 25 A400Ms under the European programme’s May 2003 launch contract, but earlier this year signalled its intention to reduce the RAF’s eventual fleet “to at least 22”. The service should receive its first example of the delayed transport in 2014, with the type currently expected to enter operational use in 2015.

France and the UK are pursuing a possible joint support model for their combined fleets of the 37t-capacity airlifter. The former is committed to buying 50 A400Ms, and will be the first nation to field the type.

Upgrading Australia's Air Traffic Management Technology - Aerospace Technology,"Mon, 30 Aug 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm9zcGFjZS10ZWNobm9sb2d5LmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9mZWF0dXJlOTQ0MTcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In March 2000, Australia unveiled its advanced air traffic system (TAAATS) – a revolutionary hardware and software system designed to help manage the country’s rapidly growing number of domestic and international flights. The move was the largest aviation infrastructure project in the country’s history and involved the creation of two of the world’s most advanced air traffic control centres – one in Melbourne and another in Brisbane.

TAAATS is overseen by the government-owned air traffic control company, Air Services Australia, which is responsible for managing the 63 million passengers that fly onboard more than four million of the country’s domestic and international flights every year. The company employs over 3,000 members of staff, including 900 air traffic controllers deployed at its two main control centres and 26 other control towers nationwide.

Air Services Australia has been working closely with global technology provider Thales since the system’s inception in order to deliver continuous software upgrades and system enhancements. The most recent of these occurred in December 2009 when Air Services Australia and Thales successfully delivered TAAATS V12 – a major software upgrade designed to support the introduction of new radar surveillance tracking, QNH processing, safety-net monitoring and radar bypass services.

Peter Curran, manager of strategic operational initiatives within Air Services Australia’s air traffic control group, says he believes the latest upgrade will offer domestic air traffic controllers greater surveillance of Australian skies.

“TAAATS is overseen by the government-owned air traffic control company, Air Services Australia.”

""TAAATS version 12 has provided Air Services Australia with a major surveillance capability upgrade that will allow us to move towards a more modern surveillance tracking system and more integrated alerting,"" he says



""We have commissioned a significant number of ADS-B sites which now give us complete ADS-B surveillance above 30,000ft (FL300) over continental Australia, as well as the first multilateration system (MLAT) to give us complete surveillance over Tasmania.""

""Since January 2010 we have also deployed additional safety enhancements to the controller pilot datalink communication interface (CPDLC) and track label highlight features.""

The latest move is specifically focused on updating surveillance processing in a bid to align the system with any developments in international standards. Taking several years to complete, the upgrade required a large multinational team of Thales engineers to help develop and modify more than 1.3 million lines of code. The team eventually implemented a total of 51 enhancements to the existing operational TAAATS environment, which was rolled out across multiple sites in Australia.

""We have managed to develop a very close relationship with Thales. The company has even maintained a presence in Australia specifically to support our programme,"" Curran says.

""Thales has also continued to develop its Eurocat product – a computerised air traffic control and management solution currently being trialled in more than 100 flight information regions worldwide – in conjunction with us and other customers in the region.""

Increasing surveillance

Before the introduction of TAAATS in 2000, Australian air space was divided into six flight information regions. In order to prepare for the new system’s arrival, Air Services Australia trimmed this figure down to just two regions, managed from Melbourne and Brisbane.

Using the new system, Air Services Australia was, for the first time, able to display all controlled and detected aircraft on a plan view display. Likewise, all flight information began to be displayed on track labels and electronic flight strips while new features were also introduced to Australia’s air traffic control network such as conflict alerting, conformance monitoring, and CFIT protection in terminal areas, integrated radar and satellite surveillance and datalink communications. TAAATS also marked Australia’s transition to a paperless air traffic control environment.

""Before TAAATS was introduced, there were several years of human machine interface (HMI) development and system design and testing for the software and hardware components. Development of controller training and procedures development took place over the three years in the lead up to commissioning and has continued throughout the life of the product,"" Curran says. ""We also carried out extensive controller training and simulation for the transition to TAAATS.""

Be prepared

Ten years on and Air Services Australia has continued with its thorough approach to preparation and training. The company has conducted around 77 software upgrades to the operational system since its inception – ranging from implementing minor configuration changes to facilitating software and hardware enhancements. The company has also had to act quickly to keep the system up to speed with the fast growth of the Australian aviation sector – namely by adding air traffic flow management strategies as airports increase in demand and capacity or monitoring current and forecast weather patterns using Flex tracks (a sophisticated ground and cockpit technology that tracks live weather in order to highlight tailwinds and favourable weather conditions).

“TAAATS V12 has provided

Air Services Australia with

a major surveillance capability upgrade.”

""Through TAAATS we have been able to deliver a highly reliable and safe air traffic service that takes advantage of all the leading existing technologies available both on the ground and in the air,"" Curron says. “Many other regional air navigation service providers (ANSPs) have visited our facilities and had briefings on our systems. We have provided training – operational and technical – as well as given systems procurement and management advice to several ANSPs in the region."" The company confirms that it intends to continue its policy of routinely upgrading the system software in the future. But for the time being, Curron is content with the advantages gained from the introduction of TAAATS V12.

""Since the last upgrade, we have been able to gather a more accurate picture of where the aircraft are whilst the conflict detection tools has allowed us closer (higher density of traffic) and yet safer separation of aircraft. Furthermore, we have been able to reduce lateral separation standards for ADS-B-equipped aircraft from the large procedural standards (20nm and greater) to more efficient surveillance standards (5nm),"" Curron says.

""The upgrade has also given us the possibility of accepting different format radar data. This has paved the way for our terminal area radar replacement programme, which involves deploying new low energy radars that will benefit the environment.""","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9933731555938721}",neutral,0.9933731555938721,0
(104) The Last Airbender and five elements of ancient Chinese philosophy - 코리아타임스,"Thu, 26 Aug 2010 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtvcmVhdGltZXMuY28ua3Ivd3d3L2N1bHR1cmUvMjAyNC8wNC8xMzVfNzIwOTYuaHRtbNIBPmh0dHBzOi8vbS5rb3JlYXRpbWVzLmNvLmtyL3BhZ2VzL2FydGljbGUuYW1wLmFzcD9uZXdzSWR4PTcyMDk2?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"I recently went to see the film ``The Last Airbender’’ in theaters. Prior, I had seen a trailer that showed it was a story about elemental nations at war and an ``avatar’’ who can control each of the four elements (water, earth, air and fire), which caught my attention and incited a comparison with the five elements of Eastern philosophy.By Janet ShinI recently went to see the film ``The Last Airbender’’ in theaters. Prior, I had seen a trailer that showed it was a story about elemental nations at war and an ``avatar’’ who can control each of the four elements (water, earth, air and fire), which caught my attention and incited a comparison with the five elements of Eastern philosophy.It is obvious that the original story for the film was based on ancient Greek philosophy. Empedocles,a pre-Socratic philosopher (490-430B.C.), established the four elements to constitute all the structures in the world ― water, earth, air and fire.Although there are many discrepancies between Eastern and Western concepts of the universe, it is interesting that there always lie common threads.Needless to say, our ancestors (whether Western or Eastern), wondered what comprised the universe and how. In an effort to explain the phenomena without reference to mythology, they found answers from within nature and its substances. First, Thales started from water. In Eastern philosophy, there is also an underlying thesis that the universal energy cycle begins and ends with water. In Asian belief, the five elements circulate from wood to fire to earth to metal to water and then to wood again. The starting element of wood implies the presence of water already ― without it, there is no energy.Here we must understand that in Eastern philosophy is it not about the individual elements, but the energies within their relationships. Harmony is the most important priority of all.There is a common hypothesis between East and West about the three fundamental elements: water, earth and fire. Then, in Asian culture, metal was added after the Iron Age, and wood was inserted to circulate the energy between water and fire. This concept of the universe centralizes on the actions and reactions among the elements ― none is isolated from the other.Gi, the fundamental life-force as defined in Eastern philosophy (also known as ``chi’’), circulate all five elements to generate and restrict among themselves, which is the role dictated to ``air’’ in Empedocles’’ classification of the four elements. The acts of the two do not seem to be the same.The film does depict the constant factor in life that is ``push and pull,’’ that brings such developments as love and strife, existence and non-existence, aggregation and segregation. This is associated with the Eastern philosophy of yin and yang and is actually mentioned in the film’s plot. Despite the fact that the four elements are expressed as separate and battling forces (mostly by the fire nation), it is interesting to see the similarities and observe how modern entertainment portrays the characteristics of each element.In saju, we classify people with a fire day master to be explosive and a sense of proliferation, while those with a water day master are recognized by their wisdom, flexibility and ability to adapt. And, according to their dynamic relationship, water will eventually restrain fire.But these do not stand for dictating what or who is good or evil. As you have read, saju does not provide conclusive information ― no single aspect can be explained without observing the whole structure.Though there will be an inevitable sequel to the film, it is clear from the first installment that fire and water are two strong opposing energies in both the East and the West.The concept of reincarnation is also shown in the movie, though director M. Night Shyamalan’s interpretation led to stray from the story’s ideals from Western philosophy. The awkwardness of the actors in their roles served to degrade the identity of the film, which firmly planted its foot into the realm of Hollywood entertainment at that point.However, as the story is based on Nickelodeon’s animated TV series ``Avatar,’’ and only the show’s success drove producers to create a film, it may be overly analytical to discuss its underlying meaning.Though it had the potential to create an inquisitive new audience and garner interest in the philosophy of elements, ``Airbender’’ seemed to fall flat ― in both the philosophical and box office senses.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999911785125732}",neutral,0.9999911785125732,0
