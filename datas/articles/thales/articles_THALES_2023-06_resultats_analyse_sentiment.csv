CNBC interviews Thales CEO about why AI should be explainable - University of Cincinnati,"Mon, 26 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVjLmVkdS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjMvMDYvY25iYy1pbnRlcnZpZXdzLXRoYWxlcy1jZW8tYWJvdXQtd2h5LWFpLXNob3VsZC1iZS1leHBsYWluYWJsZS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales CEO Patrice Caine touted an artificial intelligence system created by a University of Cincinnati graduate as a responsible model for the future.

Caine spoke to CNBC about the need for companies to adopt responsible AI.

“AI can bring the best and the worst out,” Caine told CNBC. “That's why we developed this quite unique approach we call 'TRUE AI' for transparent, understandable and ethical AI.”

UC College of Engineering and Applied Science graduate Nick Ernest developed the system and is now working at Thales as chief architect in avionics.

“Transparent means you need to know how it works so it can't just be a black box,” Caine said.

“Understandable means at the end of the day to validate the idea proposed by the AI it needs to be understandable. You need to understand what it means when it says yes or no,” he said.

“And ethical values need to be taken into account. How? It's easy to say. More difficult to implement into our daily engineering job. But that's clearly the goal we set for ourselves.”

Thales, one of the world’s leading aerospace companies on national defense, space exploration and aeronautics, in March signed a five-year research agreement with UC to develop digital and aerospace technology.

Ernest and UC graduate Tim Arnett, senior AI researcher at Thales, gave a presentation on the novel artificial intelligence during this month’s North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society’s annual conference at UC’s Digital Futures building.

The new option consists in the addition of a pod (and radar system) to deploy 4 LMM missiles.

According to Olivier Lequeux, Turret marketing manager at KNDS, the new missile option is “a normal step in our roadmap for this system”.

The LMM missile is based on a laser beam riding system. “In our roadmap it will be a solution to add a new guided ammunition in the future” added Lequeux. The two companies also added a radar which brings the advantage to be able to engage in all conditions. The LMM bring more range to the RAPIDFire: The missiles have the capabilities to engage targets up to 7 KM.

There is a lot of request internationally for such system combining missiles plus cannon because the combination covers a large spectrum of threats.

The first two RAPIDFire turrets have been delivered to the French Navy to be fitted on the new Jacques Chevallier-class supply vessel (known as BRF in the French Navy). The first at-sea test campaign is schedule for September and October.

Designed to protect platforms from low-level air threats, including drones, RAPIDFire can autonomously and automatically acquire, identify and destroy a threat using target designation data provided by a combat management system. With a ready rack of 140 rounds of ammunition, corresponding to about 30 interceptions, the system offers effective firepower against drones and swarms of drones, avoiding attrition of surface-to-air missiles in the event of a saturation attack.

According to KNDS, RAPIDFire is the only system capable of defeating all types of threats, including personal watercraft, free-floating mines, ships, loitering munitions, unmanned aerial systems, fighter jets, attack helicopters and missiles at ranges of up to 4,000 meters, thanks to automatic real-time selection of different types of ammunition,

According to Thales, LMM is a low cost, lightweight, precision strike, missile, which has been designed to be fired from tactical platforms including fixed or rotary winged UAV s and surface platforms. The system is designed to provide a rapid reaction to a wide range of the surface threats from wheeled or tracked vehicles, towed artillery or static installations; naval threats from small ships and fast inshore attack craft and an air threat from light aircraft.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999202489852905}",neutral,0.9999202489852905,0

“The Ukrainian conflict showed that a wide spectrum of threats come from the skies [in] different sizes, from planes and helicopters to hypersonic missiles, and small and large drones, which we didn’t face in the past,” Thales executive vice president for land and air systems Christophe Salomon told Breaking Defense in an interview last week.

As such, Salomon said the company is working to expand its air defense offerings by integrating a new array of sensors to detect threats and countermeasures to defeat them efficiently.

“The integrated air defense system has an open architecture that connects all this equipment together, allowing us to integrate new sensors and effectors that we are in [the] process of developing now,” Salomon said.

RELATED: Embraer not talking to Ukraine about A-29, but hopes for other breakthroughs in Europe

The idea of air defenses working efficiently is especially a priority. For example, Salomon noted the interest in directed energy weapons that the company is developing “in order to counter these [UAV] threats, knowing it is not feasible and cost effective to destroy a threat costing €10,000 with a €1 million missile.”

Salomon said the company is “also in the process of developing new products to counter ballistic missiles through HF — high frequency bands.”

“With these kind of missiles there is a very short time to respond, and the sooner the detection, the more time we have for reaction. Hence, we are developing the UHF wavefront (Ultra high frequency) family,” he said.

Salomon was speaking to Breaking Defense at this year’s Paris Air Show where Thales was showing off a key element of integrated air defense: radar. Specifically, the company was advertising its Ground Master 200 MM/A, an upgraded version of the Ground Master 200 that was sent to Ukraine with much fanfare.

RELATED: Raytheon is now RTX. Here’s what that means for its defense arm.

The system is designed not only to identify targets, but to identify what available defense weapons are best positioned to take them out, by passing data from a radar operator’s screen to a weapons operator’s tablet. The MM/A upgrade increases the range of the system by some 100 kilometers over the 250-kilometer range of its predecessor, the company said, and provides better precision at long distance and resolution than the GM200.

“This makes a huge difference on the area covered by the radar,” a Thales engineer told Breaking Defense.

The engineer said that the MM/A radar, its mast, power generator unit and operational air-conditioned cabin for two operators are all contained in a 20-foot shelter that is transportable by truck, just like the GM200.

“The radar can be operational 13 minutes from the moment the truck stops and deploys its outriggers,” the engineer said, adding with a smile, “Well, 15 minutes if you haven’t done it before.” And it can pack up and scamper off in 10 minutes if it becomes clear that its position has been compromised.

The first GM-200 MM/A should be available from 2024, Salomon said.

Alongside the upgraded radar, Thales advertised a counter-UAV system known as PARADE, which Salomon said can be integrated into the larger air defense system and has been chosen by the French government to help protect the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris.

The air defense offerings have caught the attention of buyers, especially in the Middle East, Salomon said, including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar — countries that have not been shy in recent years about improving their air defense capabilities.

Of PARADE specifically, Salomon said the company has “propose[d] this configuration to many partners and different versions of the system whereby the country chooses different effectors like the drone to counter drones with a net, direct laser weapons, and we are discussing that with different partners in the Middle East.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9994015693664551}",neutral,0.9994015693664551,0

COMMIT and Thales have signed a contract for the production and delivery of the AWWS fire control cluster and sensor suite for the four new ASW Frigates that Damen Naval will build for the Belgian and Netherlands’ Navies. This contract follows on the development contract signed in 2018.

Valued at several hundreds of millions of euros, this contract illustrates Thales’s leading position worldwide in naval fire control and sensor technology. It will be executed by Thales’s naval Centre of Excellence in Hengelo (the Netherlands).

Thales will deliver the AWWS fire control cluster that continuously generates the best solution for each approaching threat in every environment. AWWS is a cutting-edge warfare suite that helps the ship’s crew to counter and neutralise high-velocity and complex saturation attacks by continuously analysing and optimising the tactical environment and deployment of resources. This integrated radar and fire control system combines the information from several sensors, including radars.

The new sensor suite uses Thales’ latest technology based on the APAR Block 2 X-band and the SM400 Block 2 S-band radars integrated in a one-radar system that is able to reconfigure its tasks dynamically.

In addition to AWWS, Thales supplies the Mirador Mk2 electro-optical fire control sensor, the Gatekeeper Mk2 electro-optic observation sensor, the Scout Mk3 low detectability naval surveillance radar as well as an extensive logistic support package.

The first ship will be operational in 2029. The ASW frigates will replace the Belgian and Netherlands’ multi-purpose frigates of the Karel Doorman class that are reaching the end of their lifecycle.

The ships will operate in a complex multi-mission environment, with anti-submarine warfare as their main task. The frigates need to be able to independently defend themselves and other units with a state-of-the-art fire control system as above water threats are exponentially increasing in complexity, coordination and speed. Thales systems, cyber-protected by design, will protect the Dutch and Belgium frigates from sophisticated threats such as hypervelocity missiles and swarm attacks.

Christophe van der Maat, Netherlands’ State Secretary for Defence: “The procurement of the ASW Frigates is realized in the best possible way: through intensive cooperation between countries, armed forces and industry. The result will be an innovative and powerful weapon system. That is beneficial to us as direct users but also to Europe and NATO.”

Admiral Arie Jan de Waard, commander of COMMIT: “Thales’ AWWS fits in perfectly with our priority: guaranteeing the availability of material and the safety of our personnel. The threats that this new generation of frigates may be confronted with require the support of a defence system with AI capabilities. As the navies of Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany will have the same fire control cluster on their new ships; this contract will facilitate international cooperation.” ​

Arnout Damen, CEO of Damen Shipyards Group: “This is a wonderful project and a special new chapter for our Damen Naval division. We are proud to be building these beautiful frigates and look forward to working with the many, mostly Dutch, partners and suppliers on this project. With these launching customer projects, we retain vital knowledge in our own country and thus maintain our place in the world's top tier of complex naval construction. More importantly, the crews of the Dutch and Belgian navies get state-of-the-art frigates to carry out their crucial tasks.”

Gerben Edelijn, CEO of Thales in the Netherlands: “We are delighted that, once again, Thales was selected to provide the fire control capability and sensor suite for a new class of frigates for the Belgian and Royal Netherlands Navies. The crew of the ASW frigates can rely on our ultramodern Above Water Warfare System that forms an effective defence against present-day and future threats. With most Western European navies relying on Thales technology, we play a valuable role in international cooperation and the security of Europe.”

PT Len Industri has ordered 13 Ground Master 400 Alpha long-range air surveillance radars with the associated SkyView Command and Control system to strengthen Indonesian airspace sovereignty, creating a bubble of airspace protection.

The airspace protection system installed across the Indonesian archipelago will enable Indonesia’s armed forces to benefit from a single air picture integrating the detection of all types of threats, from jets and missiles to hovering helicopters and unmanned air vehicles (UAVs), contributing to early detection of threats.

The transfer of production of certain components will enhance PT Len’s radar expertise and knowledge, as well as position PT Len as the radar centre of excellence for Indonesia.

Today, GM 400 Alpha is one of the world’s best-selling combat proven long-range air surveillance radars, contributing to airspace protection worldwide with more than 80 radars from the GM400 family sold to 19 nations. This selection confirms the success of GM radars in South East Asia.





Today 19 June 2023, at Paris Air Show 2023, Thales and PT LEN officials celebrate a new milestone towards Indonesia’s airspace protection capabilities with the future delivery of 13 Ground Master 400 Alpha long-range air surveillance radars and the associated Command and Control system (SkyView).

The resurgence in geostrategic confrontations has significantly increased demand for airspace protection. In addition to aircraft and missiles, UAVs now also constitute a threat to airspace sovereignty. Thales air surveillance solutions selected by PT Len will strengthen Indonesia’s Airspace sovereignty and protection.

Renowned for the performance of detecting threats at long range and low altitude, the GM400 Alpha provides superior situational awareness for early detection helping armed forces enhance airspace sovereignty. The digital architecture of the radar ensures that it remains resilient to new threats, cyber-attacks and electronic warfare tactics.

SkyView, a complete command and control (C2) system, covers large geographical areas and ensures the full integration of Indonesian Air Operation Centres at local, regional and national levels. Skyview provides an integrated accurate 360° air surveillance picture through the easy-to-deploy and combat-proven Ground Master (GM) 400 Alpha tactical radars. As soon as the air threat is detected and identified, the relevant effectors can be selected and activated.

This contract will span the next few years with Thales building the radars and Command and Control solution and PT Len constructing the radar stations, providing the installation and integration of the systems including managing civil works for the programme, supported by Thales. PT Len will manufacture certain components of the radars locally, building local indigenous capabilities, contributing towards Indonesia’s strengthening of local defence industry.

This milestone further cements the strategic collaboration between PT Len and Thales, who announced in November 2022 the creation of a joint-venture (JV) that will start with local Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) activities for radars in service with the Indonesian Air Force, projected to begin operations in early 2024. Additional cooperation topics will be explored including radars, Command & Control systems, military satellites, and Combat Management Systems.

“Thales is proud to contribute to safeguarding and enhancing the sovereignty of Indonesian airspace. ​ Our commitment to Indonesia goes beyond just providing equipment. We are excited to deepen our strategic partnership with PT Len to define a roadmap for Indonesia’s defence modernisation, including the development of an Air national C2 centre as well as local radar MRO activities.” Christophe Salomon, Executive Vice President, Land and Air Systems, Thales.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999960660934448}",positive,0.9999960660934448,1

On a helicopter, the IESI must be able to withstand high levels of vibration and electromagnetic interference as well as offer the pilot optimal readability in all circumstances, especially when using night vision goggles. In a single piece of equipment, the IESI incorporates pressure probes and sensors, accelerometers and gyrometers, which form an artificial horizon, as well as an LCD display, and provides the pilot with the vital speed, altitude and attitude information needed for safe flying.

Perfectly optimised to the specific constraints of helicopters, the third-generation IESI from Thales also offers enhanced reliability and a smaller environmental footprint, thanks to 25% lower weight and 33% lower power consumption compared to the first generation

The first IESI will enter service in 2027 on the Guépard joint light helicopter, the military version of the H160; it will follow the entry into service of the IESI on the Airbus H135, H145, H160 civil and H175 helicopters, scheduled for early 2026.

“The Thales teams are delighted to have been selected by Airbus Helicopters. Tens of thousands of pilots around the world rely every day and in all circumstances on this safety-critical equipment, which our engineers were first to invent and which has again today demonstrated its importance.” Jean-Paul Ebanga, Vice President, Flight Avionics, Thales.

This latest service entry will be another step in an industry adventure with its roots in France for 30 years. Thales’s Vendôme facility, which has been producing artificial horizons since 1993, became the centre for IESI design, assembly and testing when the Group launched production in the late 1990s. Since then, 30,000 aircraft and helicopters around the world have been equipped with Thales IESI instruments. Three other Thales sites in France are also gearing up for the production and repair of subassemblies for this equipment: Châtellerault, which designs and produces inertial systems, Moirans, which provides the LCD display, and Valence, where the pressure sensors are made.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9530289769172668}",neutral,0.9530289769172668,0

As part of the Medium Range Radar 2023 project (MRR 2023), the Estonian Center for Defence Investment (ECDI) contracts Thales to supply 2 Ground Master 400 Alpha (GM400α) radars, complementing airspace protection offered by the previous generation’s GM400 delivered with the MRR2010 project.

A game changer for air surveillance - the GM400α, a 3D radar, provides one of the highest performance on the market. With its full digital architecture, it tracks air threats at a range of up to 515 km, with superior low altitude detection, including slow moving UAV’s.

Renown for outstanding reliability, unmatched performance and high mobility, the GM400α plays a critical role in air surveillance worldwide.



©Thales - Paris Air Show, Signature Ground Master 400 Alpha - Estonia

At Paris Air Show, France, the Estonian Center for Defence Investment (ECDI) contracted 2 Ground Master 400 Alpha radars for the Estonian Air Force to reinforce the country’s airspace. Estonia was one of the first countries to procure the GM400 since its launch in 2008.

Given the multitude of threats and conflicts in constant evolution, building a reliable, accurate, up-to-date Recognized Air Picture (RAP) is becoming a challenge. To maintain airspace sovereignty, Forces need to rely on assets that provide superior situational awareness at all times.

The resurgence in geostrategic confrontations has significantly increased demand for airspace protection solutions. In addition to conventional aircraft and missiles, unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) now also constitute a threat to airspace sovereignty. Easy-to-deploy Ground Master (GM) radars have become highly survivable assets for detecting all kinds of threats at long range and at low altitude.

Leveraging on years of successful field experience, GaN technology and a digital architecture, the new GM400 Alpha provides 5 times more processing power, an increase in instrumented range of 10% (515km) and is ready for advanced artificial intelligence capabilities.

Estonia is historically a long-standing user of the GM400 radar since its first acquisition of 2 GM400 in 2009 for MRR2010 and mid-life upgrades in 2022. This new contract demonstrates the Estonian Center for Defence Investments (ECDI) satisfaction with Thales radar solutions. In particular, the mobility of GM400 Alpha, rather unique for a radar of this class, is well tuned for operational survivability.

Designed to offer unprecedented mobility, GM400 Alpha fits into a compact 20ft container with built-in lifting systems, and offer excellent redeployment times.

Today more than 200 Ground Master radars have been sold around the world, proof that this radar family is widely recognized for its high reliability and unparalleled performance.

« We highly value the long-term collaboration with Thales,"" said Priit Soosaar, Strategic Category Manager (C4I, Cyber & Radars) at the Estonian Centre for Defence Investments.""In the current market situation, we found this to be an economically advantageous solution with timely deliveries, ensuring a high-quality air picture on NATO's eastern flank.""","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9999995231628418}",positive,0.9999995231628418,1

The trials took place as part of the Anglo-French Maritime Mine Counter Measures (MMCM) programme which, is delivering autonomous capability for both the Royal Navy and the Marine nationale.

A significant step towards autonomous mine-hunting operations has been achieved after Royal Navy Motor Boat (RNMB) Apollo, an Uncrewed Surface Vessel (USV) delivered by Thales, completed a demanding series of Royal Navy and industry open water assurance trials.

RNMB Apollo has successfully completed tests that prove remotely controlled uncrewed vessels can be operated by a team at a shore-based control station, completing a series of tasks, while retaining awareness of its course and position utilising line of sight communications systems.

This is believed to be the first UK Military clearance of its kind.

It has recently been confirmed by the UK Ministry of Defence that the trials were run in December 2022 by the Royal Navy Maritime Autonomous System Trials Team (MASTT), supported by Thales. Observing and approving the trials off Weymouth Bay were representatives from the UK Naval Authority and Technology Group (NATG) and the Mine Hunting Capability team from the Ministry of Defence.

The programme is delivering world leading maritime mine warfare capabilities, which will keep the UK and France at the forefront of naval autonomous systems technology. The delivery of uncrewed mine clearance platforms will allow the Royal Navy (RN) to continue their important role of keeping shipping lanes open without putting ​ sailors or crewed platforms into the threat area.

Fitted with a powerful combination of sensors, including radar, LIDAR (light detection and ranging) and electro-optical and infra-red cameras, the vessel’s position was continuously relayed to the command and control centre over a secure communications network.

This connection enabled the command and control software to merge the sensor inputs into a single (Coherent) tactical picture using Thales MCube mission management software. It also allows detection and tracking of other vessels and to take appropriate actions, including remotely controlled avoidance manoeuvres.

In service, these vessels will be capable of operating in national waters or being air-transported quickly across the world to hunt for mines in danger zones or secure sea lines of communications, while demonstrating high rates of reliability, autonomy and cybersecurity. They can be deployed and operated from ship and shore bases providing configurable and performant capability.

RNMB Apollo is one of the two pre-production Uncrewed Surface Vessels delivered to the Royal Navy and Marine nationale (French Navy) in December 2021 as part of the joint UK-France Maritime Mine Counter Measures (MMCM) programme which will bring autonomous mine hunting capability to the two respective Fleets.

With stage two of the contract now in the production phase, Thales is actively working with the customers and will be able to deliver full operating capability to both Nations in 2024.

“As the first of their kind, these trials are a significant milestone in the path towards certification of autonomous maritime systems for operational use. They represent one of the first important steps in gaining trust in uncrewed vessels in a complex programme. The trial is a critical remote operation stepping stone towards autonomous mine hunting.” Alex Cresswell - Chief Executive and Chairman, Thales UK.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7070198059082031}",neutral,0.7070198059082031,0

Financed by the European Commission through the European Defence Fund to the tune of 75 million euros, the EPIIC (Enhanced Pilot Interfaces & Interactions for fighter Cockpit) project brings together 27 major players from European industry and research.

Led by Thales, the project aims to meet the challenges of future air combat by identifying, developing and evaluating breakthrough technologies and new human-machine interfaces to be integrated into the cockpits of future fighter aircraft.

These technologies will support pilots who have become true collaborative combat strategists by creating an immersive environment to support the mission.

Thales is coordinating the project and is focusing its work on two key technologies: helmet-mounted sights and the Crew Monitoring System, which monitors the crew's physiological parameters.





At the heart of future air combat, the EPIIC project led by Thales aims to rethink human-machine interaction by using the most advanced technologies to create an immersive environment where the machine supports the pilot. The fighter pilot will be able to supervise and operate a set of platforms, with or without crew, in a highly complex and evolving environment.

The European project Enhanced Pilot Interfaces & Interactions for Fighter Cockpit (EPIIC) aims to identify, develop and evaluate disruptive cockpit technologies that will revolutionize the collaborative air combat of the future. Funded with €75 million from the European Defence Fund, this project, coordinated by Thales, brings together a consortium of 27 manufacturers and research organizations from 12 European countries. [1]

The need to accelerate the OODA loop - Observe, Orient, Decide, Act - and to act with complete discretion, will lead the pilot to become a true strategist, capable of managing the resources at their disposal and of replanning the phases of their mission in flight to ensure its success. The three-year EPIIC project aims to study and develop technological solutions that will improve the strategist pilot's situational awareness and facilitate rapid decision-making in the most complex situations, while monitoring his or her physiological state.

Thales is at the heart of defence issues in all fields and environments, designing technologies to provide armed forces with superior capabilities, both in terms of platforms and collaborative combat between them. Within the framework of EPIIC, Thales is coordinating the project and focusing its work on two key technologies: helmet sights and the Crew Monitoring System, which monitors the crew's physiological condition.

The future helmet sight will have to retain the advantages of previous generations - limited weight, brightness, precision, resistance to ejection - while offering a wider field of vision, superior immersion by day and night, and intuitive display of mission and flight information.

The helmet will also be able to house biological sensors measuring blood oxygenation, heart rate and brain activity, in order to analyze the pilot's condition (hypoxia, fatigue, stress, etc.).

The consortium will also evaluate a virtual assistant solution for the mission commander, taking into account their physiological state, a valuable support in case of cognitive overload, fatigue, stress or tunneling.New displays such as future free-form curved screens, canopy projection of pilot or mission information, and innovative human-system interactions will also be part of EPIIC's research topics.

""We are honoured to lead the EPIIC project, under the aegis of the European Defence Fund, in cooperation with the major European players in industry and research. Together, we have the ambition to combine the best of technologies for the future European fighter aircraft cockpit, the strategic vanguard of collaborative combat.""

Thales Alenia Space, the joint company between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), has signed a contract with ArianeGroup to produce telemetry transmitters for the Ariane 6 launch vehicle. The initial contract will cover the first 15 launchers in a program that will stretch over a period of 30 years, with delivery of 30 transmitters by the fall of 2025 to prepare for the ramp-up in operations.

Europe’s new launch vehicle combines proven and innovative solutions to address changing market requirements, while retaining the recognized reliability of the Ariane family. Thales Alenia Space in Spain is now part of this family, as a supplier on Ariane 6.

Ariane 6 is a European Space Agency (ESA) program designed to maintain Europe’s position as a leader in the fast-changing commercial launch market, while continuing to meet requirements for European government missions. The launcher will be produced in two versions: Ariane 62, fitted with two boosters; and Ariane 64, fitted with four boosters, capable of dual launches (two satellites at once). The critical milestones leading up to Ariane 6’s first launch are being carefully monitored by a special task force.

The two telemetry transmitters on each launcher are primarily designed to send launcher data to the ground throughout the launch, enabling post-launch analysis of all flight data. Rated at 30W, this high-performance transmitter was wholly designed and built by Thales Alenia Space in Spain, creating the basis for a line of spaceborne digital transmitters.

This contract follows the preliminary development contract signed for Ariane 6. It includes significant commitments in terms of progress milestones and a shared commitment to significant cost reductions in order to increase the competitiveness of the product and therefore the launcher. In turn, this should increase the partners’ joint market share, needed to ensure the viability of this initial partnership.

In addition, Thales Alenia Space in Belgium is in charge of the development and production of the range safety system and the electronic control unit for Ariane 6’s nozzle steering system.

“The contract signed during the Paris Air Show confirms ArianeGroup’s trust in the skills and expertise of Thales Alenia Space’s Spanish teams, who are now part of the European launcher story,” said Stéphane Terranova, CEO of Thales Alenia Space in Spain.

Thales USV passes a significant milestone in autonomous MCM trials - Naval News,"Wed, 14 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vbmF2YWwtbmV3cy8yMDIzLzA2L3RoYWxlcy11c3YtcGFzc2VzLWEtc2lnbmlmaWNhbnQtbWlsZXN0b25lLWluLWF1dG9ub21vdXMtbWNtLXRyaWFscy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales USV passes a significant milestone in autonomous MCM trials A significant step towards autonomous mine-hunting operations has been achieved after Royal Navy Motor Boat (RNMB) Apollo, an Uncrewed Surface Vessel (USV) delivered by Thales, completed a demanding series of Royal Navy and industry open water assurance trials.

Thales press release

It has recently been confirmed by the UK Ministry of Defence that the trials were run in December 2022 by the Royal Navy Maritime Autonomous System Trials Team (MASTT), supported by Thales. Observing and approving the trials off Weymouth Bay were representatives from the UK Naval Authority and Technology Group (NATG) and the Mine Hunting Capability team from the Ministry of Defence.

The programme is delivering world leading maritime mine warfare capabilities, which will keep the UK and France at the forefront of naval autonomous systems technology. The delivery of uncrewed mine clearance platforms will allow the Royal Navy (RN) to continue their important role of keeping shipping lanes open without putting sailors or crewed platforms into the threat area.

Fitted with a powerful combination of sensors, including radar, LIDAR (light detection and ranging) and electro-optical and infra-red cameras, the vessel’s position was continuously relayed to the command and control centre over a secure communications network.

This connection enabled the command and control software to merge the sensor inputs into a single (Coherent) tactical picture using Thales MCube mission management software. It also allows detection and tracking of other vessels and to take appropriate actions, including remotely controlled avoidance manoeuvres.

In service, these vessels will be capable of operating in national waters or being air-transported quickly across the world to hunt for mines in danger zones or secure sea lines of communications, while demonstrating high rates of reliability, autonomy and cybersecurity. They can be deployed and operated from ship and shore bases providing configurable and performant capability.

RNMB Apollo is one of the two pre-production Uncrewed Surface Vessels delivered to the Royal Navy and Marine nationale (French Navy) in December 2021 as part of the joint UK-France Maritime Mine Counter Measures (MMCM) programme which will bring autonomous mine hunting capability to the two respective Fleets.

With stage two of the contract now in the production phase, Thales is actively working with the customers and will be able to deliver full operating capability to both Nations in 2024.

“As the first of their kind, these trials are a significant milestone in the path towards certification of autonomous maritime systems for operational use. They represent one of the first important steps in gaining trust in uncrewed vessels in a complex programme. The trial is a critical remote operation stepping stone towards autonomous mine hunting.”

LinkedIn

Thales, a global leader in technology and services, is excited to announce a ground-breaking collaboration with Primary Engineer to develop an innovative plant prototype designed by a talented young student. The winning design, named ""A Face for a Plant,"" emerged as part of the annual UK-wide initiative, 'If you were an engineer, what would you do?' which encourages students to identify problems and devise creative solutions.

The ""A Face for a Plant"" prototype revolutionises how we monitor plant health by utilising sensors strategically placed around the plant. These sensors monitor environmental conditions, such as light levels, temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. The collected data is then processed and represented on a screen embedded in the pot, displaying a face with various emotions, including happiness, sadness, and even thirst. This unique concept offers a visually engaging and intuitive way to understand a plant's needs and overall health.

Thales in the UK is proud to be the first industry partner to take on the challenge of developing a prototype from the winning design in collaboration with Primary Engineer. Thomas Blake, Graduate Engineer at Thales in the UK, who has been leading the team in Glasgow said,

I've really enjoyed leading a small team of two first-year graduates and two apprentices to develop the prototype. It's been inspiring to watch the team grow and develop new skills over the course of the project, and we’re excited to showcase the plant prototype to the young student who created the design.

Every employee at Thales in the UK can spend up to 24 hours volunteering each year and the team, consisting of Harry Jones, Mark Gallacher, Pietro Casabianca, Angus MacInnes, and led by Thomas Blake in Glasgow, have used those hours to bring ""A Face for a Plant"" prototype to life.

The prototype will be presented to the young student, Zavier, at the South East award ceremony held in Canterbury on June 22nd. This event will take place at Canterbury Christ Church University, where Zavier will be in attendance to witness their innovative design.

Primary Engineer has been instrumental in fostering young talents and encouraging them to explore engineering as a viable career path. ""If you were an engineer, what would you do?"" initiative plays a crucial role in promoting creative problem-solving skills among students. By engaging with real-world challenges, the initiative instills a sense of curiosity and innovation in young minds.

This collaboration between Thales and Primary Engineer also addresses the pressing skills gap in the engineering industry. Despite an increase in STEM undergraduates, 40% of employers still report a shortage of engineering graduates. Initiatives like ""If you were an engineer"" inspire young individuals to explore the multitude of opportunities that engineering offers, potentially leading to careers in these fields. It is imperative to encourage and support initiatives that nurture young engineering talents and bridge the gap between education and industry.

Looking ahead, Thales and Primary Engineer are planning to scale up the initiative next year. Thales will potentially take on winning designs from each region across the UK to develop a prototype of each design. By expanding their collaboration, they aim to further inspire young minds and ignite their passion for engineering.

Update July 2023:

Three more contracts for Galileo’s Second Generation development have been signed by ESA, on behalf of EUSPA, with respectively GMV (Spain) for the Ground Control Segment, Thales (France) for Security Monitoring and Thales Alenia Space (France) on the Ground Mission Segment. In total, an amount of approximately €900 million has been awarded since summer 2022 which will lead forward the development of Galileo’s Second Generation to provide more robust, resilient, and new services in the near future for users worldwide.

The main procurements batch of Galileo Second Generation initiated last summer has been finalised, leaving the system ready for its In Orbit Validation development phase. Today, following the opening session of the European Navigation Conference (ENC), ESA Director of Navigation Javier Benedicto invited Thales (Italy), Airbus Defence and Space (Germany) and Thales Six GTS (France) to sign the respective contracts commencing System Engineering Support for the next generation of Europe’s navigation satellite system.

Thales Galileo Second Generation satellites Today, with 28 satellites in orbit, Galileo is the world’s most precise satellite navigation system, providing metre-level accuracy to more than four billion users around the globe. There are currently 10 further Galileo satellites due to be launched, after which the first of the Galileo Second Generation (G2) satellites with enhanced capabilities are expected to begin joining the constellation later in the coming years. Satellite-building contracts have already been awarded in May 2021 to Thales (Italy) and Airbus Defence & Space (Germany) to create two independent families of satellites amounting to 12 G2 satellites in total, as well as separate contracts with Safran Electronics & Defence - Navigation & Timing (France) and Leonardo (Italy) covering the ultra-precise atomic clocks carried aboard.

Airbus Galileo Second Generation satellites Following a new procurement batch in summer 2022, all of the other fundamental building blocks for Galileo Second Generation are now ready to be built with European industry, such as the system testbeds, its ground segment and engineering support. ESA, acting on behalf of the European Union Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA) as Galileo’s design authority and system development prime, has in recent months awarded up to one billion Euros in contracts, which bring the overall commitment in Galileo Second Generation close to three billion Euros in this Financial Framework.

Signing of Galileo Second Generation contracts With the European satnav community gathering at ESA’s ESTEC in the Netherlands for the annual edition of the European Navigation Conference (ENC), this year hosted by the Netherlands Institute of Navigation (NIN) around the theme of resilience, ESA provided an update during yesterday's opening session on the development of Galileo Second Generation and invited all industrial partners that act as Primes in G2 activities: Thales (Italy), Airbus Defence & Space (Germany), GMV (Spain), Thales (France), Thales Six GTS (France), Tecnobit (Spain), Leonardo (Italy) and Safran Electronics & Defence – Navigation & Timing (France). Finally, Thales Alenia Space (Italy), Airbus Defence & Space (Germany) and Thales Six GTS (France) representatives were present to sign four contracts for system engineering and technical assistance (SETA), gathering key European experts to provide assistance to ESA in its role as system prime in areas such as Engineering, Signal and Performance, Assembly Integrity and Verification and Security and PRS.

Javier Benedicto, ESA Director of Navigation The industrial family is now almost complete, with still two contracts for Security Chain and PRS System Test Bed to be awarded in the next weeks. Javier Benedicto, ESA Director of Navigation, comments: “Galileo has always been intended as a permanent resource benefiting the lives of European and world citizens, and Galileo Second Generation will ensure the system goes forward into the future with novel capabilities and additional robustness, to ensure that Galileo services are available and reliable wherever and whenever they are needed.” Ennio Guarino, ESA's Head of Galileo and EGNOS Programmes Department, stated: “The state-of-the-art G2 satellites will represent a major step forward on what has gone before and will incorporate numerous technology upgrades, developed through EU and ESA research and development programmes H2020 and Horizon Europe.”

European Navigation Conference Employing electric propulsion for the first time, and hosting a higher-strength navigation antenna, the satellites will incorporate six (rather than four) enhanced atomic clocks as well as inter-satellite links, allowing them to communicate and cross-check with one another. They will be controllable with an increased data rate to and from the ground and will operate for 15 years in orbit. In addition, G2’s fully digital payloads are being designed to be easily reconfigured in orbit, enabling them to actively respond to the evolving needs of users with novel signals and services. Miguel Manteiga Bautista, ESA Head of Galileo Second Generation, highlighted during the ENC opening session the advantages of the future Galileo generation: “As part of the overall Galileo programme, G2 aims to ensure both the long-term provision of Galileo legacy services that more than four billion people around the globe have come to rely on and the exponential evolution of Galileo activities in the coming years, fostering the leading role of European industry across the positioning, navigation, and timing sector.”

""This acquisition would enable Thales to accelerate its cybersecurity development roadmap and expand its footprint in Australia and New Zealand,"" Thales said in a statement.

With 500 employees and turnover last year of Aus$185 million (US$125 million), Tesserent is one of Australia and New Zealand's largest cybersecurity companies, it said.

""Together we will address the growing cyber needs in our country, including those of the Australian government and defence sectors,"" Tesserent CEO Kurt Hansen said in the statement.

Tesserent, which will continue to operate under its own name, ""will become the lead cybersecurity offering of Thales Australia and New Zealand"", according to the French group.

For Thales, which generated 1.5 billion euros (US$1.6 billion) in cybersecurity sales in 2022, the acquisition will strengthen its presence in Australia where it is already one of the country's main defence manufacturers.

The move furthers Thales' expansion in the cybersecurity sector, following its purchase last year of Spain's S21sec, Luxembourg's Excellium and the Dutch company OneWelcome.

The proposed acquisition, recommended by Tesserrent's board of directors, is subject to approval by shareholders, the Australian federal court and the usual regulatory approvals.

Maddison Illsley

One of our Thales in the UK employees, who was selected in 2022 to compete as part of the Great Britain Women’s Bobsleigh squad, has looked back on her first year of competition while managing her career as a professional engineer.

Former degree-apprentice, professional systems engineer, and now a Great Britain Women’s Bobsleigh Squad member. Welcome to the remarkable world of Maddison Illsley.

Her debut into the tough winter sport was all the more memorable when she and pilot Nikki McSweeney achieved a wider podium finish at their first competitive race together at an international event in Lillehammer, Norway last year.

Now back at her role as a systems engineer in change management, Maddison is balancing her day job with her bobsled and fitness training, thanks to a hybrid working scheme with Thales that allows her to combine the two.

Maddison said: “It’s been an amazing time for me and I remain incredibly grateful to Thales and the senior engineering team at Crawley for allowing me to continue to develop my professional career, alongside my bobsledding journey.”

“My early competitive races were all about nerves. Lillehammer was an overwhelming experience, competing against other international teams in front of crowds.

“To get a podium finish in my first event was unexpected if I’m honest. Wearing my helmet allows me to zone out a little bit from the noise and crowd, and focus on what I need to do. Our first run was pretty good, but we both knew we could do better.

“We gave it absolutely everything for the second run and I just remember the pilot (Nikki) whacking my helmet with joy at the finish line as she was the first to see the clock.

“For the majority of the season I was training and racing with my bobsleigh partner, Adele Nicoll; working so closely together really allows us to perfect our timing and be better as a team.

“My takeaway from the first year is that I went from absolute nerves, to looking forward to races by the end of the season.”

Now back at Crawley, Maddison’s diary is split between her engineering role in Sussex and two days a week at her bobsleigh training facility in Bath.

She said: “It’s a commitment and I have to handle my diary very carefully – right down to travel, diet, training and recovery. It takes commitment on both sides to make this work, but I really do feel very fortunate to be in this position.

A former degree-apprentice, Maddison’s five years with Thales has included working at Crawley and Glasgow, working on programmes such as the Royal Navy’s next generation Type 31 warship and optronics technology for the highly-advanced Astute submarine.

She added: “It does take a lot of self-discipline to do this, but I never thought I would be in this position and ultimately, I have the full support of my line manager and engineering leaders.

Asked if she is treated any differently now, Maddison says: “When I’m here at Crawley, I’m an engineer working among some very talented professionals. I consider myself an engineer who just absolutely loves sport and the thrill of competition. People don’t treat me any differently.

“A few people at the gym know what I do and have asked about the sport, but that’s all.

“I have the support of my family and Thales, and I’m firmly focused on my career and pre-season training.

“If I had any advice to any aspiring female engineers, it would be just do it – go for what you want and strive for your dreams. I have never worked so hard to get the results I wanted in my apprenticeship and degree, but it’s put me in this incredible position right now.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9590519666671753}",neutral,0.9590519666671753,0

Under the agreement, the company will supply Above Water Warfare Systems (AWWS), sensor suites, and associated logistic support packages for four vessels.

The frigates will receive Mirador Mk2 electro-optical fire control sensors, Gatekeeper Mk2 electro-optical observation sensors, and Scout Mk3 low-detectability surveillance radars.

Work will be facilitated at Thales’ Center of Excellence in Hengelo, the Netherlands.

Modernized Capabilities

The AWWS fire control cluster provides continuous analysis and optimization of the tactical environment and resources during naval combat.

Through this solution, crews can “counter and neutralize” high-speed and advanced attacks from adversaries at sea.

Meanwhile, the sensor suite combines Thales’ APAR Block 2 X-band and SM400 Block 2 S-band radars for dynamic situational awareness.

“Thales’ AWWS fits in perfectly with our priority: guaranteeing the availability of material and the safety of our personnel,” Dutch Command Materiel and IT Commander Admr. Arie Jan de Waard stated.

“The threats that this new generation of frigates may be confronted with require the support of a defence system with AI capabilities.”

New Frigates for Netherlands and Belgium

The agreement supports a $4.4-billion bilateral program seeking two new multirole ASW frigates each for the Dutch and Belgian Navies to replace their aging Karel Doorman and M-class frigates.

This month, Damen Naval received the contract to construct the fleet. The initiative was first unveiled in 2018.

Each vessel will have an 18-meter (59 feet) beam and a total length of 145 meters (476 feet). It can also carry up to 117 personnel.

The fleet will be armed with MK54 torpedoes, naval strike missiles, rolling airframe missiles, and 76-millimeter guns.

Supporting Europe, NATO

Deliveries of the frigates to the Royal Netherlands Navy will commence in 2029, while the remaining ships will be shipped to the Belgian Navy in 2030.

“The acquisition of the ASW frigates is taking place in the way I prefer: through intensive cooperation, between countries, armed forces, and industry,” Dutch State Secretary Christophe van der Maat said.

“In time, the result will be an innovative and powerful weapon system. This will benefit us as direct users, but also Europe and NATO.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999325275421143}",neutral,0.9999325275421143,0

JE : Over the past year or two, there has been a 7% increase in the global defense budget. This increase has accompanied – or resulted from – a shift in emphasis, from counterterrorism to the war in Ukraine and its possible consequences. Military powers are preparing for the return of inter-state, high-intensity conflict. In addition to this shift in focus, the emergence of new forms of warfare – largely resulting from advances in digitalization – has brought three issues to the forefront: modernization, logistics, and cyber security.



Let’s talk about modernization – how are we seeing this play out?

DS : In the military, budget cuts, together with the diversification of investments in new technologies, have resulted in systems getting outdated. This in turn has generated a lower level of availability and readiness for operations. This is why the acceleration of systems support is so important – to increase availability. Modernization, in terms of innovation, is about new systems and new ways to protect people.





For example, over the coming decade expenditure in the military unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) market alone is estimated at USD 28 billion in research and development and USD 84 billion in equipment purchases. More than 80 000 military drones will be in service, according to IHS Jane’s. Our challenge is to stay at the forefront of innovation in this highly competitive market.





Another example is the increasing digitalization of combat platforms. Operators need better human-machine interface (HMI) to deal with increasing information. ALTEN provides expertise in HMI ddigitesign and embedded software development for many providers of electronic defense equipment, products such as infantry tactical tablet computers, optronic equipment and UAVs.

Galileo Second Generation will be made up of two independent families of satellites meeting the same performance requirements, produced by Thales Alenia Space in Italy and Airbus Defence and Space in Germany.

ESA Director of Navigation, Javier Benedicto, invited Thales Alenia Space (Italy), Airbus Defence and Space (Germany) and Thales Six GTS (France) to sign respective contracts to initiate System Engineering Support for the next generation of Europe’s navigation satellite system.

With 28 satellites in orbit, Galileo provides meter-level accuracy to more than four billion users around the globe. There are currently 10 further Galileo satellites due to be launched, after which the first of the Galileo Second Generation (G2) satellites with enhanced capabilities are expected to begin joining the constellation later in the coming years.

Satellite-building contracts were already been awarded in May of 2021 to Thales Alenia Space (Italy) and Airbus Defence & Space (Germany) to create two, independent families of satellites amounting to 12 G2 satellites in total, as well as separate contracts with Safran Electronics & Defence – Navigation & Timing (France) and Leonardo (Italy) covering the ultra-precise atomic clocks carried aboard.

Following a new procurement batch in the summer of 2022, all of the other fundamental building blocks for Galileo Second Generation are now ready to be built with European industry, such as the system testbeds, its ground segment and engineering support.

ESA, acting on behalf of the European Union Agency for the Space Program (EUSPA) as Galileo’s design authority and system development prime, has in recent months awarded up to one billion Euros in contracts, which bring the overall commitment in Galileo Second Generation close to three billion euros in this Financial Framework.

Employing electric propulsion for the first time, and hosting a higher-strength navigation antenna, the satellites will incorporate six (rather than four) enhanced atomic clocks as well as inter-satellite links, allowing them to communicate and cross-check with one another. They will be controllable with an increased data rate to and from the ground and will operate for 15 years in orbit.

In addition, G2’s fully digital payloads are being designed to be easily reconfigured in orbit, enabling them to actively respond to the evolving needs of users with novel signals and services.

“Galileo has always been intended as a permanent resource benefiting the lives of European and world citizens, and Galileo Second Generation will ensure the system goes forward into the future with novel capabilities and additional robustness, to ensure that Galileo services are available and reliable wherever and whenever they are needed.”

— Javier Benedicto, ESA Director of Navigation

“The state-of-the-art G2 satellites will represent a major step forward on what has gone before and will incorporate numerous technology upgrades, developed through EU and ESA research and development programmes H2020 and Horizon Europe.”

— Ennio Guarino, ESA’s Head of Galileo and EGNOS Programs Department

“As part of the overall Galileo program, G2 aims to ensure both the long-term provision of Galileo legacy services that more than four billion people around the globe have come to rely on and the exponential evolution of Galileo activities in the coming years, fostering the leading role of European industry across the positioning, navigation, and timing sector.”

Ennio Guarino, ESA’s Head of Galileo and EGNOS Programmes Department, stated: “The state-of-the-art G2 satellites will represent a major step forward on what has gone before and will incorporate numerous technology upgrades, developed through EU and ESA research and development programmes H2020 and Horizon Europe.”

Employing electric propulsion for the first time, and hosting a higher-strength navigation antenna, the satellites will incorporate six (rather than four) enhanced atomic clocks as well as inter-satellite links, allowing them to communicate and cross-check with one another. They will be controllable with an increased data rate to and from the ground and will operate for 15 years in orbit.

In addition, G2’s fully digital payloads are being designed to be easily reconfigured in orbit, enabling them to actively respond to the evolving needs of users with novel signals and services.

Miguel Manteiga Bautista, ESA Head of Galileo Second Generation, highlighted during the ENC opening session the advantages of the future Galileo generation: “As part of the overall Galileo programme, G2 aims to ensure both the long-term provision of Galileo legacy services that more than four billion people around the globe have come to rely on and the exponential evolution of Galileo activities in the coming years, fostering the leading role of European industry across the positioning, navigation, and timing sector.”

Thales-Supplied USV Successfully Completes RN Assurance Trials - European Security & Defence,"Thu, 15 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vZXVyby1zZC5jb20vMjAyMy8wNi9uZXdzLzMyMjc4L3RoYWxlcy1zdXBwbGllZC11c3Ytc3VjY2Vzc2Z1bGx5LWNvbXBsZXRlcy1ybi1hc3N1cmFuY2UtdHJpYWxzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Royal Navy Motor Boat (RNMB) Apollo, an uncrewed surface vessel (USV) delivered by Thales to the UK Royal Navy (RN) as a pre-production platform, has completed a demanding series of RN and industry open-water assurance trials, Thales announced on 14 June 2023.

The trials were run in December 2022 off Weymouth Bay by the Royal Navy Maritime Autonomous System Trials Team (MASTT) and supported by Thales, while observing and approving them were representatives from the UK Naval Authority and Technology Group (NATG) and the Mine Hunting Capability team from the UK Ministry of Defence. The trials took place as part of the Anglo-French Maritime Mine Counter Measures (MMCM) programme, which is delivering autonomous capability for both the RN and the French Navy.

According to Thales, RNMB Apollo has successfully proven that remotely controlled uncrewed vessels can be operated by a team at a shore-based control station, completing a series of tasks, while retaining awareness of its course and position using line-of-sight communications systems.

Thales stated that the MMCM programme “is delivering world leading maritime mine warfare capabilities, which will keep the UK and France at the forefront of naval autonomous systems technology”. The company added that the delivery of uncrewed mine clearance platforms to the RN will allow it to continue the “important role of keeping shipping lanes open without putting ​sailors or crewed platforms into the threat area”.

With RNMB Apollo fitted with a powerful combination of sensors, including radar, LIDAR (light detection and ranging) and electro-optical/infra-red cameras, the vessel’s position was continuously relayed to the command-and-control centre over a secure communications network. This connection enabled the command-and-control software to merge the sensor inputs into a single, coherent tactical picture using Thales’ MCube mission management software. This also allows the detection and tracking of other vessels so that RNMB Apollo can take appropriate actions, including remotely controlled avoidance manoeuvres.

Once in service, vessels like RNMB Apollo will be capable of operating in national waters or being air-transported quickly across the world to hunt for mines in danger zones or to secure sea lines of communication while demonstrating high rates of reliability, autonomy and cyber security, according to Thales. They can be deployed and operated from either ships or shore bases.

RNMB Apollo is one of the two pre-production USVs delivered to the RN and French Navy in December 2021 as part of the UK-French MMCM programme (the other one being RNMB Artemis). With stage two of the contract now in the production phase, Thales said that it is actively working with the customers and will be able to deliver a full operating capability to both nations in 2024.

The capabilities provided by the MMCM programme will ultimately replace the manned mine countermeasures vessels (MCMVs) operated by the British and French navies. The RN’s seven Sandown-class MCMVs are due to be retired between now and 2031, while the RN’s Hunt-class MCMVs are due to be retired between 2029 and 2031.

“As the first of their kind, these trials are a significant milestone in the path towards certification of autonomous maritime systems for operational use,”Alex Cresswell, Chief Executive and Chairman of Thales UK, was quoted as saying in a company press release. “They represent one of the first important steps in gaining trust in uncrewed vessels in a complex programme. The trial is a critical remote operation stepping stone towards autonomous mine hunting.”

Thales strengthen its partnership with the Italian Navy with a new Integrated Service Centre in La Spezia Naval Base - EDR Magazine,"Thu, 08 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lZHJtYWdhemluZS5ldS90aGFsZXMtc3RyZW5ndGhlbi1pdHMtcGFydG5lcnNoaXAtd2l0aC10aGUtaXRhbGlhbi1uYXZ5LXdpdGgtYS1uZXctaW50ZWdyYXRlZC1zZXJ2aWNlLWNlbnRyZS1pbi1sYS1zcGV6aWEtbmF2YWwtYmFzZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"• Thales will open in La Spezia Naval Base (Liguria) a new Integrated Service Centre dedicated to the maintenance of Thales Sonars.

• The Service Centre will improve partnership with the Italian Navy and offer greater proximity and reactivity with the end users.

The Italian Navy will benefit from reduced intervention times to maximise availability of underwater research/exploration systems, which are implemented on board minesweepers and frigates.

Thales will be the Navy’s privileged partner for the maintenance of sonars installed on minesweepers and frigates thanks to waterfront support operating in the naval bases of La Spezia and Taranto. The opening of the Service Centre confirms Thales’ tailored and committed approach to naval services in helping maintain sonar mission readiness.

The minehunters branch of the Italian Navy, operating from its base at La Spezia, in the heart of the Mediterranean, forms the core of the navy’s current domestic mine countermeasures (MCM) activities, and supports also to the NATO MCM specific responsibilities. Thales’s decades of experience in sonar systems, deep expertise across the discipline, and flexibly designed support services are key to ensure sonar mission readiness.

The new Thales Integrated Service Centre will double the number of specialized resources currently employed among engineers, technicians and bid managers. The installation will cover an area of 1000 sq meters and will maximize availability to the Navy and operational efficiency for each level of maintenance.

The staff and skills of the Thales Integrated Support Centre will also be progressively reinforced at the Taranto naval base in line with a model dedicated to establishing capabilities and resources in close proximity to the Italian fleet.

The cooperation between the Italian Navy and Thales in the critical sector of underwater warfare systems has been consolidated over time. The frigates and minesweepers of the Italian Navy have been operating for years with Thales sonar suites with a globally recognized “state-of-the-art” submarine surveillance capability.

Thales underwater sensoring technology in the various segments, including Mine Warfare and Anti-Submarine warfare, is the result of decades of research, dedicated investments and co-operation with the Navies of many countries. The world leadership in the underwater sector is a record obtained with passion and determination that today the Group wants to consolidate by offering its customer an advanced and local support organization.

This is the spirit that guides the Group’s Italian technical teams in their maintenance and emergency assistance activities provided to the Navy. With the creation of the new Integrated Support Centre in La Spezia, Thales Italia will be able to centralize all maintenance activities in a single dedicated organization: from training to simulation, from the integration and installation of electronic and mechanical hardware to the maintenance and testing.

“The creation of the Integrated Service Centre in La Spezia is a commitment that Thales Italia has undertaken to strengthen the partnership with the Italian Navy, engaged in growing surveillance and intervention tasks that require ever-efficient integration of on-board sonar with the integrated tactical network (ITN) of the Navy. By having an entirely Italian team of engineers and technicians, we are sure to offer an important customer such as the Navy the proximity necessary to minimize reaction times at all levels of intervention”. Donato Amoroso, Thales in Italy CEO & Country Director

“As a key industrial partner of the navies, we have one obsession: to provide our customers with ever-better service and support in an increasingly complex environment. By acting as closely as possible to our customers, and offering them a high level of responsiveness and flexibility, we can ensure a high level of availability for their systems, which is essential to their missions’ success.” Gwendoline Blandin-Roger, Managing director Underwater Systems, Thales.

UK: Hitachi’s proposed €1·7bn acquisition of Thales’ Ground Transportation business could lead to a substantial lessening of competition in the British signalling market, the Competition & Markets Authority has provisionally concluded.

CMA will now undertake a three-week consultation on its findings and potential remedies. This could range from requiring the companies to sell parts of their existing businesses, to prohibiting the merger.

A recent market study carried out by rail regulator the Office of Rail & Road found that there are two main players in the UK market for major signalling projects — Siemens and Alstom — and other firms were not able to compete on equal terms. ORR made a number of recommendations to increase competition from alternative suppliers, such as Hitachi and Thales.

CMA says the merger of these two potential alternative suppliers would mean fewer credible bidders for main line digital signalling work, which could raise costs and negatively impact digitalisation.

Hitachi and Thales are also both active in the urban signalling market in the UK, with Hitachi installing a system on the Glasgow Subway and Thales supplying the London Underground. CMA said a merger could reduce the limited number of global suppliers with the capabilities to challenge Thales as the main provider of signalling systems to London Underground, reducing competition for future urban signalling tenders.

‘Disappointed’

Hitachi Rail said it was disappointed by the CMA announcement on June 8, and it ’remains of the firm view that the merger will not substantially lessen competition for UK signalling projects’.

It said ’our focus now is to find the best potential mitigations and an appropriate way forward’. The company reported that regulatory approvals for the merger have been secured in all other relevant jurisdictions except the EU, ’where we are making good progress towards securing clearance from the European Commission this summer’.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.6575117111206055}",neutral,0.6575117111206055,0

"Damen to Build Four Anti-Submarine Warfare Frigates for Dutch, Belgian Navies - MarineLink","Thu, 29 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmluZWxpbmsuY29tL25ld3MvZGFtZW4tYnVpbGQtZm91ci1hbnRpc3VibWFyaW5lLXdhcmZhcmUtNTA2MTkz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Dutch Ministry of Defence, Damen, and Thales have signed the contract for the design, construction, and delivery of four Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Frigates; two for the Netherlands and two for Belgium, focused on anti-submarine warfare.

The agreement was signed on HNLMS Karel Doorman, the Royal Netherlands Navy's largest ship, by the Dutch Defence State Secretary Christophe van der Maat, Damen Shipyards Group CEO Arnout Damen, Damen Naval Managing Director Roland Briene, and Thales Netherlands CEO Gerben Edelijn.

The ASW frigates are the replacements for the current Karel Doorman Class multipurpose frigates. They can be deployed for multiple tasks; however, the emphasis will be on anti-submarine warfare.

The ships will have hybrid diesel-electric propulsion and will be designed to sail as quietly as possible, to avoid detection by submarines as much as possible. On board will be a comprehensive suite of sensors to detect submarines, Damen said.

The frigates will measure 145 meters in length, with an 18-meter beam. They will have a draught of 5.5 meters at a displacement of 6,400 tonnes. On board, there will be room for a 117-strong crew and capacity for additional personnel to sail with them.

Among other things, the ASW frigates will be equipped with an Under Water Warfare Suite (UWWS), an Above Water Warfare System (AWWS) and underwater decoys.

The ships will be armed with a 76mm gun, MK54 torpedoes, Rolling Airframe Missiles (RAM) and the Naval Strike Missile. The frigate can also accommodate other weapons, such as more powerful missiles and High Energy Lasers. There are also unmanned craft and aircraft on board for use on and under water as well as in the air.

Dutch State Secretary Christophe van der Maat: “The acquisition of the ASW frigates is taking place in the way I prefer: through intensive cooperation, between countries, armed forces, and industry. In time, the result will be an innovative and powerful weapon system. This will benefit us as direct users, but also Europe and NATO.""

""This is a wonderful project and a special new chapter for our Damen Naval division,” said Damen Shipyards Group CEO Arnout Damen. “We are proud to be building these beautiful frigates and look forward to working with the many, mostly Dutch, partners and suppliers on this project. With these launching customer projects, we retain vital knowledge in our own country and thus maintain our place in the world's top tier of complex naval construction. More importantly, the crews of the Dutch and Belgian navies get state-of-the-art frigates to carry out their crucial tasks.”

“We are delighted that Thales has again been selected to supply sensor and fire control systems for a new class of ships for the Royal Netherlands Navy,” said Gerben Edelijn, CEO of Thales Netherlands. “The crew of the ASW frigates will be able to rely on our ultramodern Above Water Warfare System that provides effective defence against current and future threats. Together with the German F126 ships, the Belgian and Dutch ASW frigates will use identical, advanced technology for their defence and protection of high-value objects.”

The entire project is a joint operation with the Dutch Ministry of Defence, with some of the work to be carried out by the Ministry itself.

Arnout Damen continues: “We have almost 150 years of knowledge, skill, and technology to coordinate and execute the design and construction of complex naval vessels. This is done not only in the Netherlands, but also at our yard in Romania, where the hulls will partly be constructed.”

These hulls then come to Vlissingen for further completion, the installation and integration of weapon systems and, ultimately, commissioning of the frigates for deployment to the Belgian and Dutch navies.

The current Multipurpose frigates of the Karel Doorman Class were built from 1985 by Damen Naval (then called Koninklijke Maatschappij de Schelde). Between 1991 and 1995, eight M-class frigates were delivered, six of which were eventually sold to other countries, including two to Belgium. With the end of the service life of these ships in sight, the Netherlands and Belgium decided to jointly replace the ships with these ASW frigates. The first ship is expected to be delivered in 2029.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999740123748779}",neutral,0.9999740123748779,0

The Dutch and Belgian navies are each set to receive two vessels. Damen will handle the shipbuilding while Thales focuses on delivering an integrated radar and fire control system. Contracts were officially signed today by Secretary of State Christophe van der Maat aboard the Zr.Ms. Karel Doorman in Den Helder.

These ASW frigates will supersede the existing four multipurpose frigates operated by the Netherlands and Belgium, which have now reached their operational limits.

The Royal Dutch Navy is expected to receive its first frigate in 2029. Belgium's first ship will follow in 2030, with the remaining vessels delivered to each country by 2031.

According to Van der Maat, the procurement of these ASW frigates epitomizes a successful collaboration among nations, armed forces, and industries. The result will be a powerful, state-of-the-art weapons system that benefits not just the primary users, but also Europe and NATO.

The new frigates will be versatile, with a primary focus on distant submarine detection and combat. The on-board NH90 helicopters will assist in this mission.

Each frigate will have a displacement of 6,400 tonnes, a length of 145 meters, and a beam of over 17 meters. The frigates are designed to accommodate up to 117 personnel with extra space for an additional 34.

Furthermore, the frigates will be equipped with hybrid diesel-electric propulsion systems and designed for quiet operation, reducing their detectability by submarines.

In addition to cutting-edge weaponry and sensors, the frigates will feature an Under Water Warfare Suite for submarine threat detection, an Above Water Warfare System for detecting and neutralizing above-water targets, and a Naval Strike Missile for surface targets and ESSM Block 2 for air defense.

Thales Netherlands CEO Gerben Edelijn expressed delight at their selection to supply sensor and fire control systems for the Royal Navy's new ship class.

The Defense Department plans to procure these systems from dozens of companies, with some contracts scheduled for signing this summer and others due in 2024 and 2025. The two ASW frigates project represents an investment of approximately €1.9 billion.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996731281280518}",neutral,0.9996731281280518,0
Thales to acquire Tesserent for $176m - Security - CRN Australia,"Tue, 13 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNybi5jb20uYXUvbmV3cy90aGFsZXMtdG8tYWNxdWlyZS10ZXNzZXJlbnQtZm9yLTE3Nm0tNTk2ODA50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French defence company Thales is set to acquire ASX listed security vendor Tesserent for $176 million.

The two companies have entered into a binding scheme implementation deed (SID) under which it is proposed that Thales acquire 100 per cent of ordinary shares in Tesserent, at $0.13 each.

Once the deal is complete, Tesserent will become the lead cyber security provider for Thales’ customers in Australia and New Zealand.

Founded in 2015, Tesserent provides cyber consulting for government and defence sectors, with a 2022 turnover of A$185 million and approximately 500 employees over nine offices.

Meanwhile, Thales’ offerings include sovereign protection products, cyber security services and security products around the CipherTrust Data Security Platform the SafeNet Trusted Access Identity & Access Management.

After the acquisition, Tesserent will retain its brand, albeit as a Thales company.

Tesserent chief executive Kurt Hansen said that together with Thales, the two companies will address growing cyber security needs in Australia, including those of the government and defence sectors.

Thales Australia chief executive Jeff Connolly said the acquisition of Tesserent and its highly skilled team of cyber experts, combined with the French-owned company's system engineering experts will establish an Australian/New Zealand leader in cyber defence able to best protect the country and its national infrastructure from cyber threats.

“The Tesserent team will have access to global expertise and a strong balance sheet to provide local Australian and New Zealand businesses both a sophisticated and wide cybersecurity offering in a fragmented market,"" Connolly said.

“After the acquisition of S21sec, Excellium and OneWelcome in Europe in 2022, we continue to accelerate our global cybersecurity strategy and consolidate our leadership in cybersecurity, both for critical infrastructure as well as multinational companies,” he said.

In February this year, Tesserent acquired Brisbane headquartered infosec training company ALC Group in a $5.8 million deal, and the company operates nationwide and in New Zealand, Singapore and Malaysia.

In late 2021, Tesserent acquired Canberra-based IT services firms Pearson Corporation and Claricent for a combined $33 million to bolster its federal government business.

The company also acquired Sydney-based Loop Secure in August 2021 for $13.4 million in cash and stock, to strengthen the capabilities of its Cyber 360 security platform.

In April 2021, Tesserent completed its $10 million acquisition of Sydney MSP Secure Logic.

Acquisitions in 2020 included Sydney-based cloud services company iQ3 for $17.2 million in cash and shares, Melbourne and Canberra-based security consulting firm Seer Security for $5 million and Tesserent stock and managed security service providers Airloom and Ludus Cybersecurity.

The transaction is expected to be completed during the second half of 2023, and is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.

Apart from shareholder approval, the implementation of the share scheme remains subject to certain other customary conditions including Australian Foreign Investment Review Board and New Zealand OIO approval and court approval.

It also requires Tesserent retains at least 85% of its key management during the period leading up to court approval of the scheme.

The transaction will be fully funded by Thales ’own internal resources and cash reserves, which at the end of 2022, stood at €5 billion.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9083617329597473}",neutral,0.9083617329597473,0

The passports, issued between the end of October and December 2022, did not fully complete the certification process, and therefore are not accepted by immigration authorities. Several users reported that their passports had problems shortly before boarding flights.

According to the Public Ministry, the investigation began after it was discovered that “two foreign companies would have agreements awarded with the National Superintendence of Migration for more than 120 million soles [USD $33 million] and would be controlling the issuance of these documents.”

The Peruvian National Superintendence of Migration is the government agency in charge of the immigration controls for Peruvian nationals and foreigners.

According to an investigation by newspaper El Comercio, eight years ago, the companies “Thales Dis México” and “IN Continu Et Services” managed to control almost the entire process of issuing electronic passports in Peru. The first company belongs to the Thales Group and the second is part of the IN Groupe conglomerate.

“These companies provide the notebooks, the codes and the software that allow the production and reading of these documents,” the news outlet reported.

The National Superintendence of Migration depends largely on these companies, despite the fact that one of them, Thales Dis México, faces complaints for alleged acts of corruption in Malaysia and South Africa.

Armando García, the National Superintendent of Migration, told RPP that the errors in the passports were not reported by his predecessor and that during his term the problems in the new passports were fixed.

“Those who were harmed can enter our website and do the validations. It’s free of charge with your passport number,” he said.

How do I know if my passport is invalid?

Migrations reported that citizens can enter the website (https://sel.migraciones.gob.pe/servmig-valreg/VerificarPAS) to verify if their passport is valid.

“Thales is working with airlines and the regulator to define regulations for offering in-flight Wi-Fi, and piloting Wi-Fi solution. We are in talks with Indian airlines, which wish to pioneer the technology,"" Pascale Sourisse, senior executive vice-president for international development, Thales, said.

Existing aviation regulations in India, do not permit airlines to offer internet on board for both domestic and international flights. Airlines such as Vistara offer localised Wi-Fi, but it is primarily via a small device that can stream movies during flights.

“Internationally, airlines are looking at satellite connectivity, but it is available in the airspace where the country allows it. Today, when an aircraft is flying over Indian skies, Wi-Fi is not allowed even for international flights. That will change because we are working with the regulator to define the policy, and with the airlines to put a pilot in place,"" Sourisse added.

In India, full-service carriers such as Air India aim to transform their fleet for better customer experience on overseas routes. It had placed an order for 470 aircraft in February, including 70 wide-body planes.

Thales is also working on offering digital solutions to airport operators in India to reduce the time spent by flyers at check-in counters. The company has also presented air traffic management solutions to the Indian civil aviation ministry to reduce emissions by optimising the time spent by an aircraft in the air and on ground. “We are also working for biometric solutions at airports on a pilot to facilitate passenger movement, and reduce time spent at check points by 30%,"" she said.

Thales, which has been in India since 1953, started its presence with a partnership in radar domain with Bharat Electronics Limited. The company said that it continues to expand its presence in the defence domain and is working on partnerships to build capabilities to produce air defence products that can serve the needs of Indian market and can also be exported to other markets abroad.

“We are looking to provide building blocks or complete products in the field of defence to market certain products in air defence to other countries. We are currently in the process of building capabilities with Indian partners to address that,"" Sourisse said.

The company had signed a memorandum of understanding with Bharat Dynamics Limited in February for setting up manufacturing facilities in India for precision-strike 70 mm laser guided rockets.

In the field of drones, Thales is also looking to implement a Make-in-India programme for remote identification of drones with an Indian partner and has held talks with Asteria so far and is looking to finalize a partner in this category soon, Sourisse said.

Thales Ground Master 400 Alpha Radars for Estonia - Joint Forces,"Sat, 24 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmpvaW50LWZvcmNlcy5jb20vZGVmZW5jZS1lcXVpcG1lbnQtbmV3cy82NTE5Mi10aGFsZXMtZ3JvdW5kLW1hc3Rlci00MDAtYWxwaGEtcmFkYXJzLWZvci1lc3Rvbmlh0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Estonian Center for Defence Investment contracts Thales to supply two Ground Master 400 Alpha radars as part of the MRR 2023 project.

~

Press Release, Paris, 22 June 2023: At Paris Air Show, France, the Estonian Center for Defence Investment (ECDI) contracted 2 Ground Master 400 Alpha radars for the Estonian Air Force to reinforce the country’s airspace. Estonia was one of the first countries to procure the GM400 since its launch in 2008.

Given the multitude of threats and conflicts in constant evolution, building a reliable, accurate, up-to-date Recognised Air Picture (RAP) is becoming a challenge. To maintain airspace sovereignty, Forces need to rely on assets that provide superior situational awareness at all times.

The resurgence in geostrategic confrontations has significantly increased demand for airspace protection solutions. In addition to conventional aircraft and missiles, unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) now also constitute a threat to airspace sovereignty. Easy-to-deploy Ground Master (GM) radars have become highly survivable assets for detecting all kinds of threats at long range and at low altitude.

Leveraging on years of successful field experience, GaN technology and a digital architecture, the new GM400 Alpha provides 5 times more processing power, an increase in instrumented range of 10% (515km) and is ready for advanced artificial intelligence capabilities.

Estonia is historically a long-standing user of the GM400 radar since its first acquisition of two GM400 in 2009 for MRR2010 and mid-life upgrades in 2022. This new contract demonstrates the Estonian Center for Defence Investments (ECDI) satisfaction with Thales radar solutions. In particular, the mobility of GM400 Alpha, rather unique for a radar of this class, is well tuned for operational survivability.

Designed to offer unprecedented mobility, GM400 Alpha fits into a compact 20ft container with built-in lifting systems, and offer excellent redeployment times. Today more than 200 Ground Master radars have been sold around the world, proof that this radar family is widely recognised for its high reliability and unparalleled performance.

“We highly value the long-term collaboration with Thales,” said Priit Soosaar, Strategic Category Manager (C4I, Cyber & Radars) at the Estonian Centre for Defence Investments.”In the current market situation, we found this to be an economically advantageous solution with timely deliveries, ensuring a high-quality air picture on NATO’s eastern flank.”

“Estonia is a historical client for Thales ordering the first GM400 at its launch back in 2008 and we are proud to continue to support the Estonian Air Force in its mission of air sovereignty. This contract demonstrates Estonia’s satisfaction with the GM400 and mid-life upgrade of the original 2 radars, and shows Estonia’s trust in the radar for air surveillance. Today Thales is supporting 27 nations around the world and the Ground Master radar family is a reliable and combat-proven partner for air surveillance”, Christophe Salomon, Executive Vice President, Thales Land and Air Systems.

Crystal Cabin Award Winners That Could Simplify Aircraft Maintenance - Aviation Week,"Wed, 07 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vYXZpYXRpb253ZWVrLmNvbS9tcm8vaW50ZXJpb3JzLWNvbm5lY3Rpdml0eS9jcnlzdGFsLWNhYmluLWF3YXJkLXdpbm5lcnMtY291bGQtc2ltcGxpZnktYWlyY3JhZnQtbWFpbnRlbmFuY2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Several winning products from this year’s Crystal Cabin Awards include technology features aimed at simplifying aircraft maintenance.

Collins Aerospace won the Passenger Comfort category with its InteliSense intelligent cabin product. InteliSense is an integrated intelligence system that provides insights and predictions to an airline’s maintenance technicians and cabin crew. The product combines artificial intelligence, machine learning and sensor technology to collect information from objects within the seat environment, which is then used to enable predictive maintenance and predictive services. For instance, InteliSense can collect data from electronics to determine when faulty equipment needs to be repaired or data from a passenger’s glass to determine when a drink needs to be refilled. The data is transmitted to a crew’s electronic flight bag.

Teledyne Controls won the Health and Safety category with its Aircraft Cabin Environment Sensor (ACES) cabin air quality monitoring system. ACES uses sensors installed in the cabin and flight deck that perform real-time monitoring of airborne particulates, volatile organic compounds and gases such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and ozone. The data is automatically transmitted to a cloud service for immediate processing and analysis. Teledyne says the system can allow airlines to monitor trends on specific aircraft, such as unhealthy levels of engine oil versus exhaust or de-ice fluid, to help maintenance teams better troubleshoot efforts to specific areas. Crystal Cabin Awards judges say the system can reduce airline maintenance costs and aircraft downtime by enabling operators to validate repairs on-board with no additional sensor systems required.

Indonesia's Satria-1 deploys solar panels ahead of geostationary trip - SpaceNews,"Mon, 19 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9pbmRvbmVzaWFzLXNhdHJpYS0xLWRlcGxveXMtc29sYXItcGFuZWxzLWFoZWFkLW9mLWdlb3N0YXRpb25hcnktdHJpcC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"TAMPA, Fla. — Indonesia’s Satria-1 broadband satellite deployed its solar panels after launching on a SpaceX Falcon 9 to geosynchronous transfer orbit over the weekend, manufacturer Thales Alenia Space said June 19.

It will take about five months for Indonesia’s first very high throughput (VHTS) satellite to reach its 146 degrees East orbital slot via onboard electric propulsion, according to a Thales Alenia Space spokesperson.

Once it reaches its geostationary orbital slot late this year, Thales Alenia Space will need to conduct about three weeks of tests before Satria-1 (also known as Nusantara 3) can enter commercial service.

The $545 million satellite is slated to start providing around 150 gigabits per second of capacity across the thousands of islands in the Indonesian archipelago, and surrounding areas, by early 2024.

Deployment of PSN SATRIA confirmed pic.twitter.com/mEUehzvfKc — SpaceX (@SpaceX) June 18, 2023

SpaceX launched the 4.6-metric-ton spacecraft June 18 at 6:21 p.m. Eastern from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida.

Satria-1 separated from Falcon 9 about 37 minutes later in a mission that also saw SpaceX return the rocket’s first-stage booster for reuse.

PT Satelit Nusantara Tiga, an Indonesian consortium led by domestic operator Pasifik Satelit Nusantara (PSN), is set to operate Satria-1 under a public-private partnership with the country’s government.

The successful launch is a key milestone for Indonesia’s broadband ambitions. It comes after financing and pandemic-related manufacturing delays forced the government to seek deadline extensions from international regulators to bring the satellite into use.

PSN is also in line to operate the geostationary Nusantara Lima satellite (also known as Nusantara 5), which Boeing is building for a SpaceX launch later this year.

Meanwhile, Thales Alenia Space aims to deliver a broadband satellite in 2024 called Telkom 113 for Telkomsat, a subsidiary of Indonesian state-owned telecoms operator Telkom.

Indonesia’s geography lends itself to satellite-based communications because of the operational and financial challenges of deploying terrestrial networks over a territory with more than 18,000 islands and islets — of which the government says 6,000 are inhabited.

Procurement at Thales and your graduate career Content service - TARGETjobs,"Wed, 21 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3RhcmdldGpvYnMuY28udWsvY2FyZWVycy1hZHZpY2UvYnVzaW5lc3MtY29uc3VsdGluZy1hbmQtbWFuYWdlbWVudC9zdGFydGluZy15b3VyLWNhcmVlci1wcm9jdXJlbWVudC10aGFsZXMtZ3JhZHVhdGUtcHJvZ3JhbW1l0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Have you ever wondered what a career in procurement would be like? Or perhaps you’re wondering what procurement even is. Either way, Thales is here to reveal all.

If, once you know a little bit more about procurement (also referred to as purchasing), you think that it could be the job for you, why not apply to Thales’ procurement graduate scheme?

But first, hear from four procurement colleagues at Thales on what exactly this job involves, what the graduate programme is like, how your career could unfold and the skills that Thales is looking for in its future purchasers. Meet:

Alastair Hill, category buyer who started on the procurement graduate scheme

Chris Harwood, head of procurement in IT solution and support services and sponsor of the procurement graduate scheme

Ian MacDonald, head of procurement

Paniz Rad, procurement graduate.

What will you be working on at Thales?

If you don’t know what Thales works on, you’re not alone. That doesn’t mean it doesn’t work on things you aren’t familiar with, though. As Ian says, ‘I think it’s brilliant that whenever I tell anyone outside of the industry who I work for, they probably haven’t heard of us and yet, without knowing, they use so many of our products.’

In procurement, it is important that you care about what your employer produces. For Thales, that typically means being interested in technologies – whether that’s in its aerospace, defence, security, space or transportation fields.

‘The technology we work on is one of my favourite things about Thales,’ says Chris. ‘We support customers with a rough split of 50% civil and 50% defence. In both areas we drive future ways of working, whether in the banking sector or landing on Mars!’

What does procurement at Thales involve?

The breadth of Thales’ work means that the procurement team is responsible for buying a huge variety of items and services – most of which are at the cutting edge of technology. It also means that there are a variety of roles available in the team. For example, Ian has worked mainly on military equipment, from armoured vehicles to night vision goggles. He has worked on projects such as upgrading every RAF airbase around the world and supplying aircraft fitted with surveillance equipment to Botswana to help stop poaching. Meanwhile, Chris works in IT procurement. One of his favourite projects was called Future in Thales (FIT), leading the acquisition strategy for the future internal IT systems for Thales UK.

And procurement plays a crucial role for employees as well as products: Paniz works on making internal processes easier – including by making software more effective for staff – and, since rolling off the graduate scheme, Alastair has responsibility over contracts relating to workers’ dental cover, healthcare and benefits. His previous work includes a placement in the company’s Ground Transportation Systems area, where he was tasked with finding a weather data provider to assist with raising awareness of potential dangers on rail networks.

No matter what you’re working on, you’ll be uniquely placed to impact the company’s product quality, performance, growth and reputation. ‘Procurement at Thales is a key function that supports and leads the business to an improved top line (sales) and bottom line (profits). We are the only function that directly contributes to both,’ explains Chris.

Who will you be working with at Thales?

As a procurement graduate, you’ll be communicating with stakeholders at all levels of Thales, as well as at external businesses that the company works with. ‘I love working with knowledgeable professionals who are so generous in sharing their expertise,’ reflects Paniz. This collaborative culture is brought about because everyone is keen to do what’s in the interests of Thales – which includes knowledge-sharing. ‘We are all ultimately driving for the same outcomes,’ says Chris.

Not only do Thales employees work with people in different roles, but they do so at an international level. Alastair explains: ‘The nature of Thales being a global company allows for collaboration across multiple countries and the developing of relationships with colleagues across the world.’ Chris, for instance, has had opportunities to visit Paris and Canada, where he sat inside a flight simulator designed and built by Thales.

What is the procurement graduate scheme like?

The procurement graduate programme consists of four six-month placements in different areas within procurement, such as category management, procurement project management, subcontract management and supplier performance management. Each rotation provides a new set of challenges, so graduates interact with multiple teams and develop a solid understanding of how procurement functions at Thales.

Thales recognises that learning from each other is particularly important at graduate level when you’re getting to grips with procurement. Chris, who sponsors the procurement graduate scheme at Thales, is heavily involved in facilitating this. ‘I have set up a system whereby procurement graduates meet bi-weekly, creating an open environment where we can communicate efficiently, and share knowledge and experiences,’ says Chris.

The graduate scheme also offers…

Training and development opportunities

As well as starting training from the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS) in the second year, procurement graduates are offered virtual training sessions from the European Institute of Purchasing Management (EIPM) and online modules throughout the programme. ‘I have received training in cost analysis, negotiation techniques and supplier relations,’ recounts Paniz.

Well-being and flexible working initiatives

The company doesn’t focus solely on helping graduates with their work, however. With smart working charters that promote well-being and work-life balance, as well as half-day Fridays to help ease the transition into the weekend, Thales is working at making sure welfare is priority.

Colleagues also provide support at a personal level. Every graduate is given a ‘buddy’, who helps them settle in and answers any questions they have, as well as dedicated placements managers. ‘There are regular meetings put in place to track progress and to simply ask how we are doing and what extra support we need,’ says Paniz.

Independence

Thales gives graduates the freedom to own their work and follow their own interests. ‘The responsibility that Thales allows its graduates enables them to have a sense of ownership over their work, be that a bid, project or supplier relationship. While help is at hand, you are encouraged to be independent,’ says Alastair. ‘You are also given the freedom to take up different opportunities that come up. I have been able to get involved in projects and pieces of work that fall outside my job role.’

Progressing your procurement career at Thales

Ian and Chris both started out as buyers for Thales, before working their way up to management positions. The development of understanding and skills throughout the procurement programme allows graduates to progress in similar ways, if that is their ambition. As Ian explains: ‘The graduate scheme at Thales is there to take the right people to the most senior roles in Thales.’

How to get a job in procurement: Thales’ tips

Thales’ recruitment process includes an online application form, online game-based assessment, telephone interview and assessment centre. Below are some tips for how to impress throughout these stages.

Do your research

‘Preparation is the best advice I can give: think about the company, its markets, its customers and how procurement as a function fits in to the business to add value,’ advises Chris. Use Thales’ website, alongside content posted on its social media pages and news stories about the company, for research. The website of the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS) will give you a better understanding of the procurement industry, too.

After researching, reflect on the ways in which your interests, values and skills (see below) are suited to the company and procurement. This will allow you to confidently explain and show how you are a strong fit for the company.

Demonstrate key procurement skills

Below are the skills and qualities regarded as crucial by Alastair, Chris, Ian and Paniz. So, it would be a good idea to show you have them during the recruitment process – and work on them beforehand if you need to.

Communication

Confidence

Problem solving

Resilience

Attention to detail

Curiosity.

Chris also mentions relationship management: ‘Solid relationships are the foundation to effective procurement when dealing with internal stakeholders or third parties, or bringing them together to resolve issues or drive innovation.’ This skill goes further than strong communication: it requires creating lasting impressions and connections.

You need to have common sense, computer literacy, good interpersonal skills, drive and motivation. I chose Project Management because the work you carry out in this type of role generates a complex and transferable skill set.”

With a hunger and motivation to learn, Bridie has excelled with her traineeship which saw her fast-track and complete her Certificate IV in Project Management Practice with the Australian College of Commerce and Management (ACCM) ahead of schedule.

“Bridie’s determination and growth mindset have made her an inspiration to young people joining our Thales business. Her demonstrated passion, her performance and commitment to learning has made her a sought-after Project Superintendent with Thales.” Max Kufner – VP Above Water Systems at Thales Australia

Often going above and beyond in her role, she worked tirelessly in assisting Project Managers to complete maintenance activities on Navy vessels.

Bridie will now move forward to represent Thales in the NSW State Awards.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9807263016700745}",neutral,0.9807263016700745,0
New Zealand Army takes delivery of new Bushmaster protected vehicles - Asian Military Review,"Fri, 02 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFzaWFubWlsaXRhcnlyZXZpZXcuY29tLzIwMjMvMDYvbmV3LXplYWxhbmQtYXJteS10YWtlcy1kZWxpdmVyeS1vZi1uZXctYnVzaG1hc3Rlci1wcm90ZWN0ZWQtdmVoaWNsZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The New Zealand Army has received the first batch of 18 Thales Australia Bushmaster 4×4 Protected Mobility Vehicles at the Trentham Military Camp located in Upper Hutt near Wellington, Defence Minister Andrew Little announced on 25 May.

The Bushmaster vehicles are part of a 43-vehicle package, worth US$62 million, that was approved by the government in July 2020. These will replace the army’s Pinzgauer Light Operational Vehicles. According to Little, the remainder of the new vehicles will arrive in batches throughout 2023.

According to the manufacturer, the Bushmaster is a mine-resistant ambush-protected (MRAP) vehicle designed and manufactured in Australia originally developed to provide the Australian Army with a versatile protected mobility vehicle.

“The arrival of the Bushmaster fleet represents a significant uplift in capability and protection for defence force personnel, and a milestone in the Government’s historic investment in our defence kit,” said Little.

“They are being tested and certified for use at Trentham Military Camp, before being sent to their home bases,” he added, noting that variants included mobile communications and command hubs, troop transport, and protected ambulances.

Apart from New Zealand, the Bushmasters are in service with the armies of Australia, Fiji, Indonesia, Jamaica, the Netherlands, the UK, and have also been donated to support ongoing operations in Ukraine.

“Our soldiers operate in a variety of challenging situations. The Bushmasters are multi-purpose vehicles that will boost their ability to help communities here in New Zealand, the Pacific, and overseas – whether they are on peace and security missions, search and rescue, or natural disaster operations,” he added.

The need to replace the army’s fleet of ageing land vehicles had been articulated in the Ministry of Defence’s (MoD’s) Defence Capability Plan 2019, with the Pinzgauer highlighted as reaching the end of its operational life and prioritised for replacement.

"Gait, face biometrics to be showcased in concept car at VivaTech - Biometric Update","Thu, 15 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpb21ldHJpY3VwZGF0ZS5jb20vMjAyMzA2L2dhaXQtZmFjZS1iaW9tZXRyaWNzLXRvLWJlLXNob3djYXNlZC1pbi1jb25jZXB0LWNhci1hdC12aXZhdGVjaNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Software République, a two-year-old six-company collaborative project working on mobility systems is scheduled to show off a concept car, dubbed the H1st vision, sporting biometrics at Paris’ VivaTech conference.

République includes some of Europe’s largest software companies including Atos, Dassault Systèmes, Orange, Renault Group, STMicroelectronics and Thales.

The concept car also received input from startups Arkamys, Compredict, Epicnpoc, Eyelights, Kardome and Stern Tech.

The VivaTech, June 14-17, is held annually in Paris and attracts up to 124,000 attendees.

Among this year’s scheduled speakers are French President Emmanuel Macron, PayPal CEO Dan Schulman, MIT Media Lab Director Dava Newman, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and, for deep perspective on the technology, Bob Metcalfe, father of Ethernet.

The H1st vision, or Human First vision, will spotlight access controls with gait and face biometrics, predictive hazard alerts, optimized vehicle range and recharging techniques and continuous monitoring of driver.

According to Philippe Keryer, a strategy and research executive at Thales, to access cars in the future, people will be identified by the car using their digital profiles (their name, height and ID photo) and video footage of them walking to the vehicle.

According to Keryer, identifying data will be encrypted and stored in the vehicle itself, in a digital ID wallet designed by Thales.

The company also developed the biometric data processing and analytics system for the vehicle’s “digital twin,” a virtual model mirror. Sensors could relay information to the twin, which can run simulations to improve performance.

The virtual twin software, which Thales developed, would also “interact with each other in their real or virtual environment – with the driver and passengers but also all other vehicles and mobility systems, alternative transport options, smart road infrastructure, connected car parks and charging stations.”

Digital twin software has been used for simulating biometric passenger access as well as for detecting road hazards.

Israel audio software firm Kardome is also set to showcase its technology at Software République.

Kardome CEO Dani Cherkassky is set to demonstrate during how his AI algorithms identify and localize speech sources in a car, reportedly even in noisy environments.

The company says this will allow a driver and passengers to interact with their car’s voice assistant.

Thales’ systems have been certified in compliance with automotive cybersecurity standard ISO/SAE 21434. This standard, which is mandatory for manufacturers in 66 countries, applies to original equipment makers and third-party suppliers of data-related systems.

Thales to snap up Australia's biggest listed cyber firm - https://www.innovationaus.com/,"Tue, 13 Jun 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlubm92YXRpb25hdXMuY29tL3RoYWxlcy10by1zbmFwLXVwLWF1c3RyYWxpYXMtYmlnZ2VzdC1saXN0ZWQtY3liZXItZmlybS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Australia’s largest listed cybersecurity firm Tesserent looks set to be acquired by Thales, with the French defence giant making a $176 million offer on Tuesday. Tesserent would retain its brand but become the lead cybersecurity offering of Thales in Australia and New Zealand.

The ASX-listed Tesserent offers cybersecurity services and products to large organisations and is one of the largest suppliers to the federal government and defence sector.

On Tuesday, it announced it had entered into a binding Scheme Implementation Deed to sell all its shares to Thales Australia for $176 million – a 165 per cent premium on its last closing price.

The proposal has been unanimously endorsed by the Tesserent board in the absence of a better offer, but is subject to approval from shareholders and the Foreign Investment Review Board.

Tesserent listed in 2015 as a managed services security provider, going on to acquire a dozen security firms to build out an “end-to-end suite” of cybersecurity services. It currently employs around 500 people and had annual turnover of $185 million last year.

The Australian company now boasts enterprise and state and federal government clients and operates under a stated mission to be the “sovereign cybersecurity provider of choice” in the local market.

In February, it added former top bureaucrat turned consultant Anthony Sheehan to its board in a strategic move as the Albanese government overhauls the national cyber strategy.

Tesserent now looks set to join French Defence giant Thales through an acquisition by its Australian subsidiary, which employs around 3,800 people. It will continue to operate as Tesserent but with a “Cyber Solutions by Thales” tagline.

“Together we will address the growing cyber needs in our country, including those of the Australian government and Defence sectors,” Tesserent chief executive Kurt Hansen said in a statement.

“I am convinced this transaction would represent a great opportunity to further grow Tesserent’s business and its people.”

Thales Australia chief Jeff Connolly said the Australian firm represents a “highly complementary” addition to its cyber offerings.

“We are excited by the combination, especially given our collective alignment to advising multiple levels of government, including national defence and clients with critical infrastructure,” Mr Connolly said.

“We are committed to growing the business and are confident it will be great opportunity to further grow Tesserent’s business and people.”
