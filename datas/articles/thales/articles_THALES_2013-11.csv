Thales Creates Infrastructure for Simpler MPOS Transactions - Via Satellite,"Thu, 14 Nov 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhdGVsbGl0ZXRvZGF5LmNvbS9pbm5vdmF0aW9uLzIwMTMvMTEvMTQvdGhhbGVzLWNyZWF0ZXMtaW5mcmFzdHJ1Y3R1cmUtZm9yLXNpbXBsZXItbXBvcy10cmFuc2FjdGlvbnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"[Via Satellite 11-14-13] Thales will be showcasing and demonstrating a range of solutions from mobile point of sale (mPOS) device manufacturers and newly announced members of its multi-partner ecosystem at Cartes 2013 in Paris, 19-21 Nov. 2013.

Thales has partnered with mobile card reader providers such as Magtek, Miura Systems and Spire Payments, and mPOS application providers such as Creditcall, to integrate hardware-based encryption and key management technologies. Hardware-based security underpins the whole mPOS ecosystem. Secure card readers encrypt the card data at the point of capture for both magnetic stripe and EMV chip cards. Hardware-based point-to-point encryption keeps micro merchants out of scope for PCI DSS and does not add to the PCI DSS burden for larger merchants already accepting cards using traditional POS terminals. Thales payShield 9000 and nShield Connect hardware security modules (HSMs) improve security; simplify security audit compliance and limit liability for PSPs.

By supporting a range of mPOS card readers and a common gateway HSM, PSPs can offer their customers a choice of hand-held devices without driving up the cost of their transactional infrastructure."
Thales's Integrated Modular Radio successfully completes flight trials for EU-funded research programme - Thales,"Fri, 29 Nov 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGFsZXNncm91cC5jb20vZW4vdW5pdGVkLWtpbmdkb20vcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZS90aGFsZXNzLWludGVncmF0ZWQtbW9kdWxhci1yYWRpby1zdWNjZXNzZnVsbHktY29tcGxldGVzLWZsaWdodC10cmlhbHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales’s Integrated Modular Radio successfully completes flight trials for EU-funded research programme Share this article

It is the first time an Integrated Modular Radio has been used on a civil aircraft.

Anticipating the increase in market demand for broadband passenger and enhanced cabin communication services, the European Commission launched Project SANDRA to challenge industry to design and demonstrate an integrated, flexible and cost-effective communications system.

…a future communications system that will bring vital benefits to an industry facing significant increases in demand.

Thales UK’s Integrated Modular Radio (IMR), a sophisticated software-defined radio based on an open architecture, a common set of interfaces and on well-proven industry standards, is at the heart of the Project SANDRA solution.

Thales’s IMR has been optimised for use across all civil aviation radio communications standards and all service domains; from air traffic control (ATC) communications in the cockpit to high-bandwidth data links for passengers in the cabin. The IMR is connected to remote antenna radio heads using technology developed by the mobile communications industry which will allow far greater freedom in the design and installation of future systems on civil aircraft.

The trials took place near Munich on an Airbus A320 provided by DLR, the national aeronautics and space research centre for Germany, one of the main partners in the project. Next steps to develop the communications system are being refined; if successful across all trials, it is anticipated that the system, including Thales’s IMR, will be adopted and implemented by 2022.

Peter Hitchcock, head of Thales UK’s aerospace business said, “The successful completion of this first set of trials paves the way for a future communications system that will bring vital benefits to an industry facing significant increases in demand. These benefits go beyond operations and improved use of valuable radio spectrum and encompass better onboard customer experience.”

CAF and Thales win Santiago metro contract | News - Railway Gazette,"Tue, 26 Nov 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWx3YXlnYXpldHRlLmNvbS9jYWYtYW5kLXRoYWxlcy13aW4tc2FudGlhZ28tbWV0cm8tY29udHJhY3QvMzg5MjMuYXJ0aWNsZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CHILE: Metro de Santiago announced on November 25 that it had awarded a consortium of CAF and Thales a US$451·9m contract to supply rolling stock and CBTC signalling for lines 3 and 6. CAF will supply and maintain 115 cars for Line 3 and 70 for Line 6.

Metro de Santiago General Manager Ramón Cañas said that construction of lines 3 and 6 was 'the greatest challenge that we have undertaken as a company, not only because we are building them simultaneously, but also because we are adopting world-class best practice'. The winning bid from CAF and Thales 'fully meets the scale of this challenge', he added.

Lines 3 and 6 have been designed for driverless operation with steel-wheeled rolling stock, and the new fleet will feature air-conditioning, passenger information systems and onboard CCTV. Metro de Santiago highlights the improved energy efficiency of the new fleet, offering increased train capacity of 260 passengers per set while in terms of kW/passenger consuming 40% less energy than its latest air-conditioned rolling stock.

Metro de Santiago said it received five bids, its highest number ever for this type of tendering exercise. Also shortlisted were Alstom, the Rápido 63 consortium of Hyundai and Ansaldo, Hitachi/Mitsubishi and Siemens."
German Air Force commissions first TRS Ground Master 400 radar - Airforce Technology - Airforce Technology,"Tue, 05 Nov 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcmZvcmNlLXRlY2hub2xvZ3kuY29tL25ld3MvbmV3c2dlcm1hbi1haXItZm9yY2UtY29tbWlzc2lvbnMtZmlyc3QtdHJzLWdyb3VuZC1tYXN0ZXItNDAwLXJhZGFyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The German Air Force (Luftwaffe) has inducted the first ThalesRaytheonSystems (TRS)-built Ground Master 400 (GM 400) long-range air defence radar system into operational service during a ceremony at Auenhausen, Germany.



The commissioning follows successful completion of extensive compliance procedures and an operational test campaign with the Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology and In-Service Support (BAAINBw), air force, Thales and TRS personnel.



BAAINBw Land-Support Department head Horst Minning said the GM 400 radar will bring a real technology breakthrough with operational benefits, such as improved tracking, low altitude detection and easy maintenance.



”Our operators will benefit hugely from these latest technologies in threat detection,” Minning said.

""The GM 400 radar will bring a real technology breakthrough with operational benefits, such as improved tracking, low altitude detection and easy maintenance.""

ThalesRaytheonSystems CEO Philippe Duhamel said, ”The excellent level of cooperation between the German Administration, the German Air Force, Thales and ThalesRaytheonSystems enabled the achievement of this important milestone in the German radar programme.”



The newly commissioned radar represents the first of six GM400s ordered by BAAINBw from TRS under a €100m deal in December 2010, to provide enhanced air surveillance throughout Germany, from the North Sea to the Alps.



Integrated into the German Air Surveillance network, the radars can be operated either from the radar site or from a remote centre, and are scheduled to replace the Luftwaffe’s former Thomson-CSF Medium Power Radar (MPR) radars, which have been operating since the 1970s.



The on-site validation of the second radar is currently underway at the Lauda-Königshofen radar site in Baden-Württemberg, while the commissioning of the entire set of six radars is planned to be completed by 2015.



A part of TRS’s fully digital 3D air defence radar family, the GM 400 is designed to safeguard vital military assets and expeditionary forces through the detection of a wide range of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), missiles, mortars and rockets from very low to high altitudes.

Boeing to offer inflight connectivity on 787 - Runway Girl Network,"Fri, 29 Nov 2013 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTMvMTEvYm9laW5nLXRvLW9mZmVyLWluZmxpZ2h0LWNvbm5lY3Rpdml0eS1vbi03ODcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Boeing plans to offer inflight connectivity on its 787-8 in under a year, after making two connectivity solutions offerable on the new 787-9, the Runway Girl Network can reveal.

Cutting into production to offer airborne Internet and cell phone services on the 787-8 has not topped Boeing’s agenda. The US airframer has been understandably reluctant to do anything that might impact 787-8 production due to the protracted delays suffered by the program.

However, Boeing is also fully aware that airlines increasingly expect the new-design 787 to offer the option of having connectivity installed at the factory, which requires ‘linefit offerability’ from the manufacturer.

A Boeing spokesman confirms that linefit offerability of Thales’ TopConnect inflight connectivity solution “will be firmed up soon for customers in mid-2014 and beyond”.

TopConnect – which enables access to OnAir’s Wi-Fi Internet and cell phone connectivity over Inmarsat’s L-band SwiftBroadband aeronautical service – is currently offerable on the 777, and Boeing has delivered multiple aircraft with the solution installed. Because TopConnect is not yet offerable on the 787, customer Qatar Airways sends its new 787s to Boeing CAS in Victorville, Northern California, where the twinjets are retrofitted with TopConnect as part of a post-delivery modification program.

TopConnect is, however, catalog offerable to customers of the larger 787-9. So too is Panasonic Avionics’ eXConnect inflight connectivity solution, which operates over Ku-band satellites. Deliveries of the 787-9 are slated to begin next year.

Like TopConnect, the eXConnect solution “will be available on the 787-8 later in 2014”, says the Boeing spokesman.

To date, Boeing has delivered over 25 aircraft with eXConnect and/or eXPhone (Panasonic’s cell phone connectivity offering). Customers include 777-300ER operator American Airlines and Boeing 747-8 operator Lufthansa.

Installation of eXConnect on the 737NG and 737MAX “is being evaluated”, says Boeing, adding, “Regardless both airplane models are being provisioned to accept either a Ku- or Ka-based connectivity solution.” Indeed, Boeing is working “with all parties” to bring Inmarsat’s Ka-band service – Global Xpress – to all of its production airplanes “as soon as the technology is proven and the network is available”. The first of four Global Xpress satellites is scheduled to blast off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 8 December.

Boeing says it is also in discussions with all “viable” connectivity suppliers. “We are actively positioning and provisioning our airplanes to accept all known connectivity solutions,” it reveals.

This is good news for the likes of connectivity providers Gogo and Global Eagle, which have not yet received ‘linefit offerability’ for their systems on any Boeing type. Asked why Global Eagle hasn’t yet retrofitted its Ku-band connectivity system to customer Norwegian’s 787s, the firm in a recent earnings conference call said, “Boeing hasn’t released the design package to let anyone do that right now.”

Hang in there for a little longer…it appears that the design package is on its way.
