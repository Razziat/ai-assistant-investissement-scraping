"Thales launches ""lighthouse"" for submarines - Renewable Energy Magazine","Fri, 27 May 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlbmV3YWJsZWVuZXJneW1hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS93aW5kL3RoYWxlcy1sYXVuY2hlcy1saWdodGhvdXNlLWZvci1zdWJtYXJpbmVz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Friday, 27 May 2011

Responding to the recommendation in Germany for offshore wind turbines to carry sonar transponders to warn submarines of the obstacles they face when moving through wind farms, the German company, Thales instruments, has launched what it describes as a “lighthouse” for submarines.

Offshore wind parks present a potential underwater obstacle for submarines. Due to this, the German Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) has included the requirement for sonar transponders in its approval documents. It became evident during the construction and implementation of the first offshore wind turbines and other offshore structures that there was no transponder on the market that met the German Armed Forces requirements regarding the emergency navigation of submarines.

After an approximately three years of research, development and testing phase, Thales announced this month the market entry of its new product, the sonar transponder THALES WISO ST-01, which provides acoustic identification of artificial underwater hazards.

The sonar transponder THALES WISO ST-01 is activated when it receives a precisely defined acoustic signal from a submarine. It then reacts by immediately sending an acoustic warning signal, which in an emergency would help to prevent a collision. While developing this product, special attention was paid to keeping the effects on marine mammals to a minimum in the event of emergency navigation system failure.

The THALES WISO ST-01 was assessed by the German Armed Forces Technical Centre for Ships and Naval Weapons, Maritime Technology and Research (WTD 71). The practical suitability of the THALES sonar transponder was tested during the research project ""Research on Sonar Transponders for Offshore Wind Parks and the Technical Integration in a Total Concept"".

This project was funded by the Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Reactor Safety and guided by the Jülich project management organization. The scientific research partners responsible for investigating the technical and ecological aspects of the project formed a cooperation including the Institute for Statics and Dynamics (ISD) in Hanover, the Institute for Technical and Applied Physics GmbH (itap), the German Wind Energy Institute GmbH (DEWI) as well as the company BioConsult SH.

Today, the BSH requires for project approval that project planners include specific plans for the installation and operation of sonar transponders. The German Armed Forces (Military District Administrative Office North) determine the exact number and position of the mandatory sonar transponders and transducers.

In the past 14 years, the Oldenburg company, Thales instruments GmbH, has made a name for itself with its innovative products and assessment services in the wind energy industry. Since the beginning of the offshore boom seven years ago, Thales has focused on offering solutions for the unique technical demands associated with the implementation of offshore wind energy parks.

The High Cost of Precision Attack - Defense Update,"Fri, 06 May 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5zZS11cGRhdGUuY29tLzIwMTEwNTA2X3ByZWNpc2lvbl9hdHRhY2suaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"This is a page 1 of a three page article: 1 – 2 – 3

Depleting stocks of Precision Guided Munitions (PGM) used by European Air Forces could soon trigger a renewed demand for these weapons, and heat up the debate of cost versus efficiency. Recent news reports from the U.S. that claimed precision munitions stocks of certain NATO members were depleting quickly were rebuffed by official responses from Britain and France, claiming their air forces could continue unaffected at current operational tempo. However, Pentagon sources insisted Washington was in talks with NATO allies to ensure a sufficient supply of munitions for the Libya bombing campaign.

NATO members maintaining smaller munitions stockpiles could be the most adversely affected. In a recent article published by Defense News, an unnamed British claimed Denmark did suffer precision weapons shortage, which was fulfilled by U.S. supplies. Britain and France are carrying out about half of the bombing raids in Libya with four other countries – Belgium, Canada, Denmark and Norway – conducting the rest.

While European Air Forces are relying heavily on U.S. produced laser guided bombs mostly produced by Raytheon, these models are uniquely designed for specific European built platforms and are not readily available to replenish British or French stocks from U.S. munitions reserves.

Although the United States has significant stockpiles, its munitions do not fit on the British- and French-made planes that have flown the bulk of the missions. The French Air Force uses the GBU-12, (Paveway II) GBU-22 (Paveway III) and GBU-49 Enhanced Laser Guided Bomb, (adding a GPS/INS to the basic GBU-12 kit. The French Rafale fighters used by the Air Force and Navy also carry the AASM stand-off guided munition.

The British Royal Air Force uses Paveway II and Paveway III kits with 1,000 pound warheads, carried by Tornado GR4 strike fighters. The Paveway IV loaded with 500 pound (225 kg) warheads is also carried by the Tornado and was recently cleared for the Typhoon, a step soon followed by similar clearance of the European equivalent – EGBU-16 for the German, Italian and Spanish versions of Typhoon. The European choice of enhanced LGB derive from its inherent all-weather capability, considered better adaptable to the European climate. EGBU-16 employs the 1,000 pound bomb shell converted into a guided weapon.

The Typhoon maintains an autonomously air-to-ground capability since 2008, employing the Litening III target acquisition and laser designation pod with laser guided munitions. Both types of weapons are combining GPS/INS and laser guidance enabling high precision attack under adverse weather conditions that would hinder the use of standard LGBs.





Precision has its Cost

How much European Air Forces will be asked to pay for replenishing their stock is yet unknown. Guided weapons are sold for $15,000 for the cheapest laser-guided types, to quarter of a million apiece, for the most versatile, and sophisticated models, providing stand-off, autonomous, off-boresight attack modes. The scale of the orders should also determine the cost to each customer. Maturity of the weapon have a factor on the cost per unit.

For example, a the cost of a basic JDAM kit as paid by the Pentagon was about $40,000 ten years ago. After producing almost quarter of a million weapon, Boeing could drop the cost to around $25,000, as reflected in recent orders. As weapons become more sophisticated, their cost increase – Paveway II laser guidance kits were sold for $12,000 ten years ago, but increased four to seven times higher, when served with improved seekers, electronics and optional GPS, associated with the Paveway III version. Depending on the size of the weapon – ($40,000 for a 1,000 pound and $70,000 for the 2,000 pound warhead.

like many other aerospace systems, the cost of such weapons is often increases with the weight. Additional costs are involved with the integration of GPS navigation kits. Those comprise special anti-jam receivers (SASSM) that further increase the cost of otherwise off-the-shelf capability. Overall, the cost of an EGBU-12, is around $40,000, compared to the past generation, $12,000 laser only baseline kit. In the past decade Raytheon has sold over two billion worth of laser guided bombs, by far its most active production line of laser guided bombs.

Boeing originally expected JDAM sales will add up to about two billion, but the conflicts in the Middle East and Central Asia have increased demand, actually doubling that figure. A much smaller, yet equally precise, stand-off capable weapon is the GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb (SDB), sold for around $40,000 each (this price also reflects the cost of the associated SDB carriage system). Future acquisitions will not require these elements and further reduce the cost of SDB munition replenishment acquisitions.

More Bang – More Bucks

There are also the more expensive options – priced in the six-digit range and up – that offer advantages over the baseline precision weapons. More flexiblility, wider launch envelope, better stand-off range, ‘man in the loop’ capability, introducing manual corrections and piloting to achieve near 100% mission success.

Typically, the more expensive weapons offer an important ‘stand off’ capability – launched from 50-60 km – keeping the launching aircraft outside the range of enemy air defense missiles. Other benefits are less restrictive launch envelope and flexible mission planning. While these weapons are twice, or four times more expensive than laser guided bombs or J-class weapons, these weapons offer a ‘low cost alternative’ to much more expensive cruise missiles.

When all these factors are measured, against potential attrition of aircraft, launching of additional missions to strike targets that were not eliminated in the first run, the cost of enhanced weapons, particularly those designed for killing Surface/Air Missile sites, attacking high value targets in the first stages of the conflict, or when operating in conditions where air supermacy cannot be achieved, the higher cost of such weapons pays off in great saving in human lives, aircraft, weapons and operational expense.

Two representatives of this class are the Israeli SPICE and French AASM and, to some extent, the American Joint Stand Off Weapon JSOW-C1.

Operational with the French Air Force, and French Naval Aviation, AASM was first deployed in Afghanistan with the French Rafale in 2008. The baseline AASM kit comprises of the INS/GPS guidance system, designed for standard 250 kg (500 pounds) bombs. The AASM family will eventually include 125, 500 and 1,000 kg (250, 1000, and 2000 pounds) versions. Since the French forces have received only the initial deliveries of 3,500 weapons ordered, chances are that the used inventory could be replenished by extending current production runs. It is assumed that new weapons could be delivered at considerably lower costs than the original ones, as the manufacturer has stepped up the learning curve. Nevertheless, the cost of a basic AASM is still expected to ship at around $300,000 apiece (€200,000).

European air forces considering their future PGM roadmaps could also consider the Israeli Spice, for their stand-off, autonomous attack capability. Earlier in 2011 Greece has awarded the Israeli company Rafael Advanced Defense Systems a contract worth about €100 million to deliver 300 SPICE 1000 weapons for the Hellenic Air Force (while this deal reflects almost $480,000 unit cost, it is asusmed the cost involves spending for setup, training supporting the new weapons). SPICE is available in 2,000 and 1,000 pound versions, and will soon be offered in a 500 level. The weapon uses GPS/INS navigation with electro-optical guidance and homing techniques to achieve accurate and effective destruction of high-value targets with pinpoint accuracy and at high attack volumes. An major advantage of the Israeli weapon is its adaptability to the Tornado and F-16 platforms, employed by a number of European Air Forces and the integration with Rafael’s Reccelite tactical recce pod, enhancing the weapon’s ability to rapidly respond in engaging time critical targets from stand-off range. Reccelite is already employed by a number of NATO air forces, including the Italian, Dutch and Royal Air Force.

Currently entering flight testing, prior to induction into service with the U.S. Navy, JSOW C-1 is an all-weather, day or night, launch-and-leave, network-enabled weapon that employs a Global Positioning System/inertial navigation system. The weapon uses an infrared seeker for terminal guidance. The test paved the way for more extensive testing, with the first free flight of the weapon expected later this year. The C-1 is a variant of the combat-proven JSOW, offering upgraded capability to strike moving maritime targets. The weapon’s Link-16 data link allows the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet aircraft to relay targeting information to the weapon. Following this initial test, the Navy is expected to follow with more extensive testing to ensure warfighter requirements are met. With the new datalink the weapon will be able to enter Navy’s secure military tactical data exchange, transferring mission data, target allocation, moving target indications and other commands. The cost of JSOW-C1 is yet unknown, but is considered to be significantly above the original JSOW, sold for around $700,000 apiece.

France stops military equipment sales to Pakistan - The Economic Times,"Fri, 27 May 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3BvbGl0aWNzLWFuZC1uYXRpb24vZnJhbmNlLXN0b3BzLW1pbGl0YXJ5LWVxdWlwbWVudC1zYWxlcy10by1wYWtpc3Rhbi9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy84NjA4MTQxLmNtc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"

BANGALORE: France will stop sales of heavy military equipment to Pakistan hoping to assuage Indian concerns and prolong the recent success it has had in winning contracts from the Indian armed forces. Gerard Longuet , the French defence minister, began his two-day visit to India by assuring the country that France does not want to be seen feeding Pakistan’s military ambitions.“Concerns did come up in my discussions with the defence minister about India's concerns. We supply Pakistan equipment that enables them to intercept terrorist communications. And we have decided to discourage any requests from Pakistan for heavy equipment, notably naval equipment,” the defence minister said.While Longuet did not expressly mention the Inter-Service Intelligence, he strongly alluded to the agency’s suspected role in providing a safe haven to the 9/11 mastermind.“After the death of Osama bin Laden, Pakistan should be given an opportunity to explain its position vis-à-vis terrorism,” he said.India, for long, has maintained that the sale of weapons by the West to Pakistan in the name of terrorism has instead been used by latter to build its own military arsenal rather than the actual purpose of the sale.French President Nicolas Sarkozy during his state visit to India last year had called upon Pakistan to fight terrorism more determinedly.There is a reason behind the hard line against Pakistan on the issue. French companies have had remarkable success in winning key defence contracts in India, including being short-listed for the $11-billion Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) tender, often described as the al-Yamamah – the famed arms race to supply the Saudi Kingdom in the 1980s - of the modern era.Further, India’s efforts to build up its submarine fleet, with Project 75 and 75I – to build six Scorpene submarines, will also see French defence companies playing an integral role.The $2.4-billion Mirage-2000 upgrade is also expected to be announced shortly. Last week ET had reported that the Cabinet Committee on Security, the apex body which is responsible for large defence procurements, had already given its approval for the contract. French defence giants Dassault Aviation, Thales and MBDA will be the lead contractors on the project.“The France-Pakistan relationship is largely based on geo-political terms. France, which is one of the most multi-cultural societies in Europe, has to take into consideration global terrorism issues. But there has been major reorientation in its foreign policy towards Pakistan,” Deba Ranjan Mohanty, senior fellow with the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation, said.Paris has been keen to establish closer defence and strategic ties with New Delhi, and by positioning itself as a more natural ally of India, it provides an interesting bulwark to the growing proximity between South Block and Pentagon “As most bilateral relationships, this is also a product of politics and economics. There is a massive commercial and strategic angle. India is not only a huge market, it is also seen as the only stable force in a very volatile region,” Mohanty said.Mr Longuet’s visit comes also at a time when India is looking to finalise the lucrative $11-billion fighter jet deal for the Indian Air Force . French aerospace giant, Dassault Aviation is one of the contenders, through its offering, Rafale.“We have one single speaking partner (Dassault) instead of four partners (European firms from Italy, Germany, Spain and UK). Mr Longuet said, taking an expected swipe at rival short-listed candidate, the pan-European consortium built, Eurofighter Typhoon.The MMRCA tender is considered the most high-profile military aviation contracts in recent times, and had some of the world’s largest defence vendors vying for it, including Lockheed Martin Boeing and Saab The French minister also said that a decision on the IAF ’s $2.4-billion Mirage-2000 fleet upgrade was also eagerly awaited.“We are in the final stages of the upgrade agreement. It is up to the Indian political establishment to take a decision. We are confident that it will happen soon,” he said.France’s ambassador to India, Jerome Bonnafont also confirmed that price negotiations over the deal had been completed, and a decision was awaited.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9993358254432678}",neutral,0.9993358254432678,0
New navy carriers 'could cost £7 bn' - Times of Malta,"Sun, 01 May 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZm1hbHRhLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL05ldy1uYXZ5LWNhcnJpZXJzLWNvdWxkLWNvc3QtNy1ibi0uMzYzMjIw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The cost of the Royal Navy’s two new aircraft carriers has risen by between £1 billion and £2 billion, it was reported.

Building HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales could end up costing the taxpayer £7 billion, the BBC said, up from the £5.2 billion expected at the time of the Strategic Defence and Security Review last autumn.

The ships, which are to be converted so they are compatible with US jets, escaped the axe in the defence review despite massive cuts elsewhere in the Ministry of Defence budget.

They are being built by the Aircraft Carrier Alliance, consisting of BAE systems, Babcock and Thales. HMS Queen Elizabeth will be the first to enter service, in 2019.

A Ministry of Defence spokes-man said final costs were “yet to be agreed”.

“The conversion of the Queen Elizabeth Class, announced in the SDSR, will allow us to operate the carrier variant of the Joint Strike Fighter that carries a greater payload, has a longer range and is cheaper to purchase,” he said.

“This will give our new carriers, which will be in service for 50 years, greater capability and interoperability with our allies. Final costs are yet to be agreed and detailed work is ongoing. We expect to take firm decisions in late 2012.”

Shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy said: “This is yet more evidence that the government’s rushed defence review was not thoroughly thought-through or costed.

“Ministers must now be clear with the British public about the real costs of their decisions. This could be a £2 billion bungle.

“The government has totally mishandled the UK’s carrier capability and now needs to be totally clear about whether both carriers will be completed and capable of deployment.

“The SDSR is unravelling and ministers must give the country confidence that they have a grip of the budget and equipment programme.”

A Downing Street official said: “Final costs have yet to be agreed. Detailed work is ongoing and we expect to take firm decisions in late 2012.” She dismissed suggestions that doubts about the final costs may prevent the carrier project going ahead.

“As far as we are concerned, the decision has been made in the SDSR and we are going to have new carriers and they will provide us with greater capability and interoperability and be cheaper to purchase,” said the official.

“In some respects, the SDSR is an ongoing process and there will be decisions to be taken in this spending review and further down the track.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999945878982544}",neutral,0.999945878982544,0
SA Army stocks up on night vision - defenceWeb,"Wed, 04 May 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuY2V3ZWIuY28uemEvam9pbnQvc2NpZW5jZS1hLWRlZmVuY2UtdGVjaG5vbG9neS9zYS1hcm15LXN0b2Nrcy11cC1vbi1uaWdodC12aXNpb24v0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The South African Army is purchasing night vision tubes worth R3 million from vendor ECM Technologies. The order was placed last month. It adds to the some R238 million spent on night vision equipment since 2007.

In addition to the R241 223 912.08 spent on new equipment, some R17 241 102.51 has been spent on maintenance and repair.

The equipment replaces dated technology based on first and second generation image intensifiers.

The acquisitions appear separate from Project Cytoon that is seeing the SA Army Tactical Intelligence Corps gaining 14 Thales Squire ground surveillance radars and 65 Thales Sophie thermal imagers.

Thermal imagers detect radiation in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Since most objects emit such radiation, thermal imagers allow their users to “see” their surroundings with or without visible light. The warmer the object, the brighter the object appears in the imager. Humans, with an internal body temperature of 37 degrees Celsius tend to stand out against their surroundings, which are mostly cooler. This also allows thermal imagers to spot camouflaged targets. Many modern thermal imagers include an eye-safe laser rangefinder and pointer, a compass, GPS and digital camera. The Thales Sophie can spot humans at over 4km, tanks at 10km, helicopters at 12km and jet fighters at 16km, Thales says.
