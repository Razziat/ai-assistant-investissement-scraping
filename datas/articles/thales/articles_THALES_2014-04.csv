Thales is playing a major role in the 30-year programme to design, construct, operate and maintain the French Ministry of Defence's new headquarters in Paris. Thales's role covers the overall design of the defence engineering side of the project, operation and maintenance of the new information and communication systems and responsibility for the site security systems. The design & build portion of the Balard project is a huge undertaking — and the task of protecting the site and its information and communication systems is no less critical.

The French Ministry of Defence, Thales's largest customer, signed a public-private partnership agreement with Opale Défense to finance, design and construct the Balard headquarters as well as operate the complex and provide maintenance services for 30 years. Thales's involvement begins at the design & build phase of the project, led by Bouygues Bâtiment Île de France, a subsidiary of Bouygues Construction.

Located in the 15th arrondissement of Paris, the Ministry's new headquarters will include the offices of the Minister for Defence and his special advisors, the Joint Staff of the French armed forces, the Chiefs of Staff of the three armed forces, the French defence procurement agency (DGA) and other key military departments and administrative services.

From the handover date, Thales will operate and maintain these systems for a further 27 years. The Group is also responsible for the continuing evolution of the installed networks to ensure that they always incorporate the latest technologies and offer the highest levels of security. Thales will also guarantee the highest levels of availability for the communication and security networks and provision of 24/7 technical support.

Thales is now operating and supporting the critical information systems and security systems for the 2,000 users who have already moved into the new facility.

By 2015, Thales will have a dedicated local team of around 100 people in place at the site.

Key objectives of the project:

Deliver the high-grade security required for the Ministry's sensitive and classified data, combined with best-in-class continuity of service.

Ensure the resilience of networks and communications against the most critical physical and cyber attacks.

Integrate with the Ministry's broader information and communication system policy, including interoperability with legacy and future systems.

Building on its proven strengths and extensive experience in network security and protection of critical sites, Thales is stepping up to these challenges.

Key points 145,000 m² of purpose-built facilities and 135,000 m² of redeveloped space.

Capacity for up to 10,000 military and civilian personnel.

Two conference centres and a media centre for press conferences.

1,000 km of fibre optic cables.

Highly secure information and communication networks.

A highly secure site protection, security and surveillance system.

""With this project, Thales is further consolidating its established strengths and expertise in network security and critical site protection, delivering the high-grade security the ministry requires, ensuring resilience against the most critical physical and cyber attacks and integrating with the ministry's broader information and communication system policy, including interoperability with legacy and future systems."" Rémi Gille, Vice President in charge of Thales's network and infrastructure systems activities

Surveillance and protection of the Balard complex

Balard is a strategic site and will benefit from the highest levels of protection and security: security systems, access control, intrusion detection and videosurveillance.

The new headquarters is a complex and sensitive site, making security a major concern at all times.

As a defence facility housing a huge number of personnel, the Balard project needed to ensure that security considerations were an integral part of the design, management, operation and maintenance of the site."
Airbus Bests Thales Alenia-OHB Team for Billion-dollar ESA Weather Satellite Contract - SpaceNews,"Mon, 07 Apr 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS80MDEwOWFpcmJ1cy1iZXN0cy10aGFsZXMtYWxlbmlhLW9oYi10ZWFtLWZvci1iaWxsaW9uLWRvbGxhci1lc2Etd2VhdGhlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"KOUROU, French Guiana — Airbus Defence and Space has been selected to build Europe’s next generation of polar-orbiting meteorological satellites after an extended evaluation that hinged in part on whether bidders could guarantee equivalent work shares in both France and Germany, industry officials said.

The European Space Agency’s Industrial Policy Committee is expected to validate the choice of the agency’s bid-evaluation board, which preferred Airbus to competitor Thales Alenia Space, on April 11. Thales Alenia of France and Italy was teamed with OHB AG of Bremen, Germany.

The 20-nation ESA has budgeted 800 million euros ($1.1 billion) for its share of the Metop Second Generation program, mainly to cover the costs of the design and construction of the first pair of Metop-SG satellites, to be launched around 2021.

Europe’s Eumetsat meteorological satellite organization of Darmstadt, Germany, has tentatively budgeted 3.4 billion euros for the remaining Metop-SG costs, including the construction and launch of one or two additional pairs of satellites, the system’s ground network and operations for 20 years.

Eumetsat governments are expected to decide by early next year whether to incur the additional capital costs of ordering a third pair of Metop-SG satellites from Airbus — in which case the per-satellite cost will be lower than for a two-pair order — or forgoing the third pair now but forcing an earlier decision on a Metop-SG follow-on.

ESA and Eumetsat structured the Metop-SG contract to require that France and Germany have equal work shares to avoid a repeat of a bitter struggle about which nation would claim leadership of the Meteosat Third Generation satellite system in geostationary orbit. After a dispute between Germany and France that delayed the program and threatened to undermine ESA’s role as a contracting authority, Thales Alenia Space and OHB won the six-satellite Meteosat contract, but only after agreeing to increase Germany’s work share on the effort.

For Metop-SG, the German and French governments agreed in 2012 that they would have broadly equal roles and that neither could plant its flag on the program. But ESA and Eumetsat also stipulated that they wanted maximum economies to be guaranteed by the contracting teams. That argued for a single company to carry away the entire prize, using a common satellite platform to carry the two sets of sensors, rather than dividing the work.

This is what has occurred with the decision to favor Airbus Defence and Space over Thales Alenia Space and OHB for Metop-SG.

For Thales Alenia Space, the loss is doubly painful because it had already lost the competition to build the IASI infrared sounder for Metop-SG. Airbus signed that 230 million-euro contract with ESA in October.

More recently, Airbus won a contract, valued at 144 million euros, for the Sentinel-5 spectrometer payload, which will ride on Metop-SG.

Thales Alenia Space’s tie-up with OHB for the Meteosat Third Generation competition was obviously an advantage as the Franco-Italian company sought to ease German government concerns about German work share by highlighting the substantial role of OHB.

Whether the OHB connection helped for Metop-SG is not clear. European government officials have privately expressed concerns that a Thales-OHB win of the Metop-SG contract would overextend OHB’s resources. The company is already juggling its prime contractor role on 22 Galileo navigation satellites, which are nearly a year late, in addition to its big share of the Meteosat Third Generation program.

The company is also building Germany’s EnMap hyperspectral Earth imaging satellite and fell so far behind schedule that customer DLR, the German Aerospace Center, stepped in to demand an accounting. OHB ultimately replaced the management team from its Kayser-Threde subsidiary, which is overseeing EnMap development.

In this instance, Thales Alenia Space had nowhere else to go in Germany, regardless of whether OHB was in a position to act as a credible bid partner, officials said. The situation is similar to Thales Alenia’s situation in Britain, which is increasing its space spending.

Airbus Defence and Space has a well-established space-hardware manufacturing presence in Germany, France and Britain. Thales Alenia Space’s strength is centered in France and Italy.

Given ESA’s geographic-return rules, which require that each nation’s industry get a program work share in proportion to its government’s contribution to a given program, Thales Alenia Space officials have agreed they will need to shore up their British and German presence over time.

Thales Alenia Space signed a contract with the ISS-Reshetnev Company in 2011 to supply the payload for the KazSat3 satellite, which will provide commercial telecommunications services throughout Kazakhstan. Thales Alenia Space also supplied all equipment for the transponders on the Loutch-5V communications satellite for the Russian space agency Roscosmos. The KazSat3 satellite, based on an Express 1000H platform, was integrated and tested at ISS facilities in Russia, with the support of Thales Alenia Space. It will be positioned at 58.5° East, and offers a design life exceeding 15 years. Fitted with 28 Ku-band transponders to cover the country's footprint, KazSat3 generates payload power of about 5.5 kW.

KazSat 3 is being launched within the scope of Kazakhstan's space program. Thales Alenia Space already provided the payloads for Kazsat1, launched in 2006, and Kazsat2, launched in 2010.

Loutch-5V is a geostationary relay satellite, positioned at 95 degrees East. It will provide telecommunications, television and data transmission services between the International Space Station and the ground. It will also be used as a communications relay for Russian satellites in LEO, throughout their lifespan, as well as with launchers. Loutch-5V offers four S- and Ku-band channels. All transponders were installed on a platform built by ISS-Reshetnev. Weighing 1800kg at launch, the satellite offers a design life exceeding 15 years.

Thales Alenia Space has teamed up with ISS-Reshetnev for more than 15 years, starting with the SESAT program. In the early 2000s, Thales Alenia Space and ISS started the joint marketing of satellites based on ISS's Express-1000 platform. ISS and Thales Alenia Space have indeed already combined their skills to develop other spacecraft for the international market, including Amos 5, Telkom 3 and Yamal 401. The two companies then announced the creation of a joint venture, Universum Space Technologies, which has been operational since August 2013. The jointly-owned company will enable the two parent companies to increase their respective market shares in both the Russian and export markets.

Mind the attention gap: What brands need to know about advertising today - McKinsey,"Tue, 01 Apr 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tY2tpbnNleS5jb20vY2FwYWJpbGl0aWVzL2dyb3d0aC1tYXJrZXRpbmctYW5kLXNhbGVzL291ci1pbnNpZ2h0cy9taW5kLXRoZS1hdHRlbnRpb24tZ2FwLXdoYXQtYnJhbmRzLW5lZWQtdG8ta25vdy1hYm91dC1hZHZlcnRpc2luZy10b2RhedIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Teixeira, Harvard Business School professor, talks to McKinsey partner Dave Edelman about how companies need to focus on attention when thinking about advertising.

Finding the balance between entertainment and information

For advertising to work, it has to attract attention before it does anything else, and then the consumer has to be persuaded before the interaction ends. But you need different content for grabbing attention vs. persuading people. To grab attention, you need to entertain. To persuade, you need to inform. Given limited ad time or space, you may not always be able to do both.

The situation is much more complicated nowadays, because people’s attention spans are much shorter and they are inveterate media multi-taskers. In this world, then, ads need to focus on doing one thing—there isn’t enough time to do more—doing it quickly, and then driving the persuasion at a later stage, in another channel, or in a follow-up ad. An effective TV ad today drives people to engage with the brand on a second medium, either on a mobile device or a computer. Therefore you are now seeing more ads that are trying to get consumers to take a specific action that is short of buying, such as going to a website. These can only work, though, if there is a compelling reason to go.

The need to grab attention means that the entertainment factor is really important. Ad design and creative really matters. A good ad creates a bridge from grabbing attention to persuading on another channel. That requires advertisers to think in a 2-step multichannel model.

Getting attention during the customer decision journey

Understanding where your target customer is during his/her customer decision journey (CDJ) can help determine where you need to focus your advertising resources. If you need to raise awareness, then your advertising should focus on entertaining people to grab their attention. But if your target audience is further along the decision journey, at the evaluation stage, for example, then your advertising needs to be focusing on providing relevant information.

The traditional approach for marketers has been to focus on attention-grabbing ads and sales promotion. The ad is still important because it allows the brand to connect with the right kinds of people in the market. But marketers need to support the implicit or explicit promise of the ad by building out a marketing infrastructure that supports the customer through the subsequent phases of the decision journey. Changes in attention habits require a more surgical strategy in thinking about the role of advertising and making sure a brand is placing the most appropriate ads in the context of the whole decision journey.

Take a look at cars. The problem has traditionally been that if auto brands can’t get someone to consider them at the beginning of their journey, they won’t be able to win them later. So how do you get consumers to consider your car? The ads have to entertain. Front-loading an ad with information isn’t going to work; people won’t remember it. Ads that entertain also help build bonds between a current owner and their car’s brand.

Build engagement slowly and deliberately

There is a lot of talk at companies about quickly increasing engagement rather than thinking in terms of building that relationship incrementally. People are not willing to watch or consume a 30-second ad if they have no connection with the brand. You have to have a coffee with someone before you ask them over to dinner. The same applies for brands. For that reason, it’s important to think in terms of developing multiple short interactions to create a “ladder of engagement” with a customer.

When you get to the local level, that’s when the channel becomes particularly important. If you’re a car dealer, for example, they’re targeting a small set of people who live nearby, that are thinking about buying car, that have a specific car and brand in mind, and that have the time to buy one. Given that scale, mass media outreach isn’t a very cost effective way to reach out to them. The other issue with these kinds of ads is that they really desensitize other people who aren’t yet ready to buy. But when they are, the ads tend to leave a negative impression on them.

Start with your media strategy

Too often companies think about the ad as the product that they have to figure out how to distribute. That’s the wrong way to think about it. Attention is the scarce resource—not the ad. Advertisers need to start by understanding the attention potential of each media. In a movie theater, an ad is going to get high quality attention. So you can think about substituting some entertainment for more information. In a TV ad, the opposite may work better.

Ad agencies need to align content with quality of attention potential for their brand, their category, and the media they buy. You really should start your media buying strategy with a hard look at, one, the attention you require, and, two, the attention that you can get. These two factors jointly determine what “attention gap” your ad content needs to address.

B2B companies have feelings too

When it comes to entertaining people, there’s also this misconception that this approach is only relevant for B2C companies. But IBM and GE have done fantastic jobs developing advertising and marketing content that drive appeal to the brand. Their ads are not about business processes. They’re entertaining stories about people, with a beginning, middle, and end. They’ve made it easy and digestible for the TV medium, and have successfully extended it to the digital space as well.

The reality is that when most executives are watching TV, they’re not watching with their “business” hats on. GE’s ecomagination and IBM’s smarter planet efforts appeal to people’s emotional sensibilities, and they are largely successful at making emotional connections with the audience. I really think that B2B companies are undervaluing the power of entertainment when it comes to their advertising."

Thales Alenia Space-built Sentinel-1A, the first satellite in Europe's Copernicus program, successfully launched

© Thales Alenia Space © THALES

The European Space Agency's Sentinel-1A satellite, designed and built by Thales Alenia Space, was successfully launched from the Guiana Space Center in French Guiana, using a Soyuz-Fregat A launcher.

Sentinel-1A is the first satellite in Europe's vast Earth Observation program Copernicus (formerly known as GMES), coordinated by the European Commission, with the European Space Agency (ESA) in charge of the space component. It is designed to give Europe complete independence in the acquisition and management of environmental data concerning our planet, to support Europe's public policies.

Thales Alenia Space was named prime contractor for the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-3 missions, with responsibility for the design, development, integration and testing of the satellites comprising these systems.

“The success of this first Copernicus launch is particularly important for Thales Alenia Space,"" said Elisio Prette, President and CEO of Thales Alenia Space Italy, ""since it further confirms our company’s recognized expertise in the construction of Earth observation satellites based on radar technology. Thales Alenia Space has once again shown that it has the skills and expertise to meet the technological challenges of this program, underscoring our company’s pivotal role and our perfect fit with Europe's strategic vision for space.""

Thales Alenia Space successful references in Radar Earth observation

The company’s expertise is largely recognized in international markets, and has led to collaborative missions outside Europe, including with South Korea (Kompsat 5), India (Saral), Canada (Radarsat 2) and the United States (Topex, Jason, Calipso, GFO-RA), Russia (Sadko).

Thales Alenia Space is making a major contribution to Copernicus as prime contractor for the Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 3 satellites. At the same time, Thales Alenia Space continues to explore the vast possibilities offered by its advanced technologies to develop new applications: for instance, taking a closer look at the carbon cycle, another key factor in climate change.

Regarding defense or dual-use missions, Thales Alenia Space is the prime contractor for the Italian dual radar observation system, Cosmo SkyMed. A four-satellite constellation, the Cosmo-SkyMed system delivers data to government, military and private users. The system is now totally operational and has reached its optimum image acquisition capacity of about 1,800 images/day, day or night and in all weather conditions. These capabilities make the Italian observation system one of the most advanced and reliable systems of this type in the world. Thales Alenia Space is also developing COSMO New Generation.

Thales Alenia Space is the acknowledged European expert in high-resolution radar imaging. The company supplied the electronics for the radar instruments on the SAR-Lupe constellation of five satellites, which delivers high-resolution images of the Earth to the German Ministry of Defense."

[SatNews] ...""allows for rapid delivery of a low risk, operationally suitable, highly reliable solution for the Army’s SRW vehicular radio needs.”

Thales Defense & Security, Inc. has been awarded an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract by the U.S. Army for its Soldier Radio Waveform Appliqué (SRW-A) radio system, the AN/VRC-121 Vehicle Integrated Power Enhanced Rifleman, or VIPER.



Developed jointly with Ultralife Corporation’s Communications Systems business, VIPER responds to the U.S. Army’s requirement for a single channel, vehicle mounted radio running SRW that can be installed into the Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) Combat Net Radio (CNR) vehicular mount or used in a stand-alone configuration. The radio system provides an independent or second channel solution for vehicle communications installations, acting as a conduit for voice and data between the dismounted soldier, mounted platforms, the Unit, and higher headquarters. VIPER provides soldiers with access to the government’s classified networks for Secret and below operations.

VIPER integrates, and interacts seamlessly, with an installed AN/PRC-154A Rifleman Radio. The Rifleman Radio, which was co-developed, and is being co-manufactured, by Thales and General Dynamics C4 Systems under the Joint Tactical Radio System Handheld, Manpack, and Small Form Fit program of record, has been fully tested, certified, and deployed. With more than 19,000 Rifleman Radios manufactured, the VIPER solution ensures that the U.S. Army has immediate interoperability with currently fielded radios, while soldiers gain greater operational flexibility due to its ability to operate in both UHF and Lbands.

VIPER provides ""Jerk and Run"" access to the installed Rifleman Radio, enabling a quick transition between mounted and dismounted operations without losing communications.

“We appreciate the importance of working closely with the U.S. Army in providing our warfighters with mission-critical capabilities,” said Michael Sheehan, in charge of Defense & Security activities for Thales in the U.S. “Our VIPER solution allows for rapid delivery of a low risk, operationally suitable, highly reliable solution for the Army’s SRW vehicular radio needs.”

The basic IDIQ contract, awarded to four companies, allows the companies to compete on future orders to support fielding requirements. The total potential IDIQ contract value is $988 Million. The initial contract award is for engineering and field service support to evaluate the SRW, a capability during the U.S. Army’s Network Integration Evaluation (NIE) 14.2 in May 2014."
