Thales has been awarded a contract by the U.S. Army for its AN/VRC-121 Vehicle Integrated Power Enhanced Rifleman (VIPER) Radio system. This award continues the Army’s initiative to push networked connectivity to the tactical edge of the battlefield and will be used as part of future Capability Set fielding. It will also equip the Brigade Modernization Command for NIE 16.2.

VIPER, developed jointly with Ultralife Corporation, is the solution for the U.S. Army’s requirement to field a single channel, vehicle mounted radio running the tactical Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW). VIPER can be installed into the Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS) Combat Net Radio (CNR) vehicle mount or used in a stand‐alone configuration. The system provides an independent or second channel solution for vehicle communications acting as a conduit for voice and data between the dismounted soldier, mounted platforms, the Unit, and higher commands. VIPER integrates and interacts seamlessly with the Army’s widely-fielded AN/PRC‐154A Rifleman Radio, and allows for rapid delivery of a low‐risk, operationally-tested, highly reliable solution for the Army’s SRW vehicular radio needs.

Thales’ VIPER and AN/PRC-154A Rifleman Radio deliver voice and data simultaneously for secure, inter-squad, networked communications and situational awareness that improve the soldiers mission effectiveness. The VIPER solution ensures that the U.S. Army has immediate interoperability with the more than 21,000 currently fielded Rifleman Radios across both UHF and L bands. It also provides ""jerk and run"" access to the installed Rifleman Radio, enabling a quick transition between mounted and dismounted operations without losing communications. The Rifleman Radio – also being manufactured by Thales under the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Handheld, Manpack, and Small Form Fit (HMS) program – has been fully tested, certified, and deployed.

Thales has leveraged over two decades of handheld radio design experience to develop the VIPER and Rifleman Radio solutions. Individually, these platforms exceeded the original program requirements by improving battery life, mission weight, and waveform performance, while also enhancing the user interface. Together, they provide the most capable, best-in-class soldier radio solution on the market. Thales remains committed to the U.S. Army’s HMS Radio programs and the network modernization initiative.

Thales’ VIPER and Rifleman Radio products are manufactured at the company’s Clarksburg, Md. facilities.

Thales Alenia Gets Going on Second-generation Cosmo-SkyMed Radar Satellites - SpaceNews,"Wed, 02 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS90aGFsZXMtYWxlbmlhLWdldHMtZ29pbmctb24tc2Vjb25kLWdlbmVyYXRpb24tY29zbW8tc2t5bWVkLXJhZGFyLXNhdGVsbGl0ZXMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — Satellite builder Thales Alenia Space on Sept. 2 said it had signed a contract with the Italian government to build one of the two planned next-generation radar reconnaissance satellites and to purchase the needed equipment for the second.

The contract is the latest development in the long Cosmo-SkyMed financial roller coaster. Inconsistent Italian government funding threatened to cancel the program until what appeared to be a definitive government commitment early this year.

The contract announced Sept. 2, signed with the Italian Space Agency, is valued at 182 million euros ($200 million). Of that sum, Telespazio of Rome, a provider of satellite services and ground equipment, will receive 28 million euros for its share of the ground segment work.

Thales Alenia Space and Telespazio announced separately that they had received a contract from the Polish Ministry of Defense to provide a Cosmo-SkyMed ground network on Polish territory.

The Polish and Italian defense ministries in March agreed to terms under which Polish authorities would have access to Cosmo-SkyMed data and could play a role in building the second-generation system’s ground segment.

Italy and Germany both operate radar Earth observation constellations. Cosmo-SkyMed has a mixed military/civil government/commercial mission. Germany’s SAR-Lupe constellation is military only. The Terra-SAR/TanDem-X satellites are available for commercial use.

The Polish ground segment will be implemented in two phases. The first, to be ready for operations by early 2017, will give Poland access to the four first-generation Cosmo-SkyMed satellites now in orbit. The second will be finished by 2019 and give Polish military authorities similar access to the two second-generation satellites.

The current Cosmo-SkyMed satellites are capable of generating imagery with a ground resolution sharper than 1 meter across, which is reserved for government and military use. The remaining capacity, from a 1-meter resolution to less-sharp imagery for broader coverage, is for civil government and commercial customers.

These four satellites were launched between 2007 and 2010. The older two are beyond their contracted design lives, a fact that gave some urgency to the second-generation decision.

Without enough funding to secure a full four-satellite replacement constellation, the Italian government agreed to order two satellites, with the first to be launched in 2018 and the second a year later.

The Sept. 2 contract permits Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales Group of France and Italy’s Finmeccanica, to build the first in time for a 2018 launch. The company said in a statement that it will need, by early 2016, full financing to complete assembly, integration and testing of the second satellite to make the 2019 launch date.

Neither of the two launches needed for the satellites is part of the financing. Each satellite is expected to weigh about 2,200 kilograms at launch – too heavy for the current version of the Italian-led Vega rocket. In the past, the Italian Defense Ministry has demonstrated a sharp independence when it comes to launcher selection.

Within Europe, the Europeanized version of Russia’s Soyuz rocket would be most likely choice for the two Cosmo-SkyMed satellites.

The Italian Space Agency is acting as Cosmo-SkyMed contracting authority on behalf of the Italian Defense Ministry and the Italian Ministry of Education, Universities and Research.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999836683273315}",neutral,0.9999836683273315,0
"WB, Thales Team To Offer Watchkeeper UAV to Poland - Defense News","Wed, 16 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9kaWdpdGFsLXNob3ctZGFpbGllcy9kc2VpLzIwMTUvMDkvMTYvd2ItdGhhbGVzLXRlYW0tdG8tb2ZmZXItd2F0Y2hrZWVwZXItdWF2LXRvLXBvbGFuZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LONDON – Poland approached Britain, Israel and the US to seek cooperation in acquiring a tactical UAV, and a positive response from the UK led WB Electronics to partner with Thales to compete in an expected tender, said Adam Bartosiewicz, vice president of WB Electronics, part of the WB Group.

The Polish Ministry of Defense sought government-to-government ties in a bid to agree technology transfer and also boost domestic industry, Bartosiewicz said Wednesday at the Defence and Security Exhibition International trade show.

A perceived support from the UK government for Thales led WB Electronics to sign up with the systems company to offer the Watchkeeper drone when Poland launches the competition for a UAV.

""Teaming with Polish industry was absolutely key for us in order to be credible for this campaign because Poland is very keen in involving its industry,"" said Pierre-Eric Pommelet, Thales executive vice president told journalists.

The Watchkeeper will be offered with the capacity to be armed, he said.

A life size model of a Watchkeeper carrying under each wing two mock-ups of a a smart bomb dubbed freefall light missile, hung in display at the Thales stand at the show.

A parliamentary election is due to be held in Poland in November so the UAV competition is likely to be launched late in 2016, Bartosiewicz said. The Polish authorities will only allow companies which can ""demonstrate the capability to deliver UAVs with their partners"", so three or four companies will probably compete in the tender, he said.

""There is strong emphasis on technology transfer and sovereignty,"" he said.

Poland and France are two potential markets for the Watchkeeper, based on the Elbit Hermes 450 and certified for use by the British Army.

Thales aims to sell the Watchkeeper in export markets drawing on a new approach named Watchkeeper X.

The UAV ""is not a product but a program,"" Pommelet said. The program aspect lies in the possibility to plug in two mission modules and a high degree of mobility to transport the drone to the field. Operators will have a choice of sensors including day and night cameras, synthetic aperture radars, and communications interception. The UAV allows prompt analysis and sharing of data in a network, and can carry weapons and share targeting data. An open architecture allows users to adapt the UAV for further missions, he said.

Thales has lined up more than 30 companies as potential suppliers if France and other prospective clients were pick Watchkeeper, he said. ""France is in the process of deciding, hopefully in the next months their solution for their tactical UAV requirements.""

Those potential partners include many small and medium-sized firms, including specialists in cryptography and datalink frequencies, which are among key French requirements, he said. Vitec, a specialist in video technology, is one of those prospective partners.

Danielson, a French diesel engine maker, seeks a partnership with WB in the Polish tender, an industry executive said.

Thales is competing in the French tender with the Patroller from Safran's Sagem.

The French requirement excludes arming the UAV, Pommelet said.

Interest has risen in UAVs in the last few months, he said. There is close attention to surveillance in Southeast Asia, and demand in the Middle East, South America and Europe. The UN is also interested.

"Thales Expands Watchkeeper, Offering WK-X for Export - Defense Update","Thu, 17 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5zZS11cGRhdGUuY29tLzIwMTUwOTE3X3drLXguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales is introducing an export variant of its Watchkeeper Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), originally developed for the UK. The first export contract being pursued by the company is Poland, seeking a UAV solution for its military forces. Watchkeeper is also one of two finalist tactical UAV systems being considered by the French Army as a successor for the Sperwer, originally produced by Sagem.

“Watchkeeper X is based on a ground-breaking, world-leading unmanned aircraft system that was designed specifically for the requirements of the British Army,” said Pierre Eric Pommellet, Thales Executive Vice-President, Defence Mission Systems. “We have now taken the knowledge and expertise that we have gained over the history of the program and looked at how we can make it more flexible, effective and readily available for our customers, to help them address the different operational contexts they may face.”

While Watchkeeper was designed primarily for Intelligence, Surveillance and Target-Acquisition Reconnaissance (ISTAR) applications, Thales is currently offering the ‘Watchkeeper X’ drone in a weaponized version, meeting the specific Polish interest in an armed UAV. Another unique advantage of WK-X is its ability to operate from rough, makeshift landing strips, enabling rapid deployment in theaters without paved airstrips.

Watchkeeper X (WK-X) is based on the company’s fully airworthy, certified to CS23/STANAG 4671 airworthiness standards, and cleared for operation in zero visibility, harsh weather conditions and extreme temperatures. Based on Elbit Systems’ Hermes 450 platform, Watchkeeper has an operational endurance exceeding 16 hours, operating at ranges in excess of 140 km., with a maximum transit speed of 95 knots. The ground-based mission control system can support several aircraft in the air, sustaining 24/7 surveillance missions.

The drone employs a dual-sensor payload configuration, conforming to a standard 15” gimbal and integral sensor cross-cuing functionality, supporting VIS/IR cameras, radar, communication intelligence (COMINT) and communications electronic support measures (ESM).

The platform is configured with underwing hard points, which can carry external fuel tanks, pods or lightweight weapons, such as Thales’ FFLMM. WK-X provides effective surveillance, identification and targeting with pin point accuracy. On board sensors are employed to acquire and designate targets, and, in cases of engagement of time-sensitive targets, operators can use on-board weapons to act on the intelligence obtained by the drone in real time.

[ismember]While the French competition is between Thales and Sagem, the Polish competition places the Watchkeeper’s original designer, Elbit Systems, in an unusual position. Under the Gryf (Griffin) program, Poland is seeking to field 12 tactical-class UAV systems. A tender is expected soon, and the winners are expected to be selected by mid-2016. For this proposal, Thales has teamed with the Polish WB Electronics, part of the WB Group. This partnership is of critical importance for Thales, as Poland insists on having full access and control of the system’s software, mission computer, cryptographic systems and data transmission devices. This access will enable Polish engineers and authorities to have full control of the drone’s armament system.

But Thales could find the Israeli company Elbit Systems, its partner in the Watchkeeper program through the U-TacS UK-based JV, on the other side of the fence, competing on the Polish tender. Elbit has teamed with the Polish company PGZ to offer the Hermes 450 UAV for the Gryf program. It has also teamed with its bitter competitor IAI to offer a solution based on Israeli systems, under the Government-to-Government deal lead by Israel’s Ministry of Defense. “we want to manufacture our own medium range UAV systems, based on the Hermes 450 platform.”

Wojciech Dąbrowski, President of the PGZ Company said. Should the Polish MOD selects the Israeli Hermes 900 MALE UAV systems for the Zephyr program, the infrastructure established for Hermes 450 could be used to support both the Gryf tactical and Zephyr MALE UAV systems.

Thales is a leader in the field of Wideband HF with its ground-breaking non-contiguous technique as presented at the annual High Frequency Industry Association conference. Customer demonstrations of this technique which comprise both the non-contiguous and 110C contiguous standard will be available next year.



Building on Thales's experience of designing one of the world's largest HF systems for the Royal Navy Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft carriers, MSN 8200 delivers excellent RF performance, interoperability with all major naval standards, and optimisation for the naval environment.



With Naval vessels typically having an in-service life of 25 years, and with one major refit during this period, the opportunity for navies to take advantage of new technology is challenging. Because MSN 8200 is form, fit and function backwards compatible with Series 5000 and Series 6000 radios, it provides existing customers with a viable and cost effective upgrade to the latest HF technology.



Thales has more than 60 years' experience of the market and its Series 5000 and 6000 Naval HF radios are deployed by more than 20 Navies worldwide.

The radios will also support the Army's Network Integration Evaluations at Fort Bliss, Texas, and White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, he said.

Viper combines a vehicle-mounted, single-channel ground and airborne radio system with a handheld Rifleman radio for dismounted soldiers with the Soldier Radio Waveform. It will give soldiers a second channel to transmit voice and data up and down the chain of command, as well as link them to the Nett Warrior, a secure Android phone-type device.

The handheld Rifleman radio fits into the mounted radio kit and can quickly detach, which provides what Thales describes as a ""jerk and run"" capability, ""enabling a quick transition between mounted and dismounted operations without losing communications.""

Thales is manufacturing the Rifleman radio under the Joint Tactical Radio System Handheld, Manpack and Small Form Fit program, which is fully certified and deployed. Harris Corp. also has a contract with the Army to provide the lightweight, hand-held radios.

The integrated arms package for the Malaysian armed forces comprises the Starstreak missile, ControlMaster 200 radar and weapon coordination system, Rapid ranger and Rapid rover mobile weapon systems, next generation lightweight multiple launcher, and communications, Thales said in a statement.



The missile deal is worth more than £100 million and the two defense ministers witnessed the initializing of the contract at the Lima defense exhibition, Malaysia, a few months ago, Dunne said.



British Prime Minister David Cameron recently visited Malaysia, indicating the long-term security relations between Britain and Malaysia, Dunne said.



Asked about a recent French offer of the Dassault Rafale fighter jet to Malaysia, Hussein said the Malaysian administration would ensure there would be ""transparency"" in the selection and communication with the public.



French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian recently visited Malaysia with a high level team comprising senior members of parliament and company chairmen, and visited the airbase where the first Airbus A400M transport plane for the Malaysian Air Force is based.



There is a strong orderbook for the Starstreak missile, with six years of backlog for employees at the Belfast plant, Thales Executive Vice President Alex Cresswell said. Southeast Asia is a strong market for the missile, with Thales competing in a tender in Singapore, which is ""recompeting"" the Saab RBS70 missile.

Two Competitors Remain to Supply France with UAV - Defense News,"Thu, 10 Sep 2015 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9ob21lLzIwMTUvMDkvMTAvdHdvLWNvbXBldGl0b3JzLXJlbWFpbi10by1zdXBwbHktZnJhbmNlLXdpdGgtdWF2L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Paris — Systems company Thales and Safran's Sagem defense unit are competing to supply a tactical unmanned aerial vehicle for the French Army, as competitors Airbus and Israel Aerospace Industries are no longer in the tender, website La Tribune reported.

Thales has pitched Watchkeeper, a UAV built in a joint venture with Elbit, while Sagem has offered the Patroller, a drone based on a Stemme airframe.

""We are in the competition,"" a Thales spokeswoman said Sept. 10.

Sagem was not immediately available for comment.

The two companies submitted their best and final offers Sept. 4 to the Direction Générale de l'Armement, with the procurement office expected to award the contract for 14 units at the end of the year after a decision by the ministerial investment committee, La Tribune reported.

The DGA declined comment.

The French Army is keen to find quickly a tactical drone to replace the Sagem Sperwer, an interim UAV.

IAI Europe confirmed it was not going ahead in the competition. The company was ready to work as a partner to the prime contractor, which ""could reduce cost, cut lead time and improve performance,"" said Daniel Abehsera, managing director of IAI Europe.

Airbus Defence & Space declined comment. The Airbus unit announced last year at the Eurosatory trade show it had teamed as prime contractor with Textron to offer the Shadow tactical drone.

Sagem at the Eurosatory trade show last year highlighted the importance of national sovereignty as there would be French control if the Patroller UAV were picked, and France would not rely on US clearance for technology or authorization by foreign authorities.

There is perceived political significance in UAVs, as the operators seek a national control of the key elements of image, audio and data transfer, encryption, and arming the aircraft, an industry executive said.

That national sovereignty issue requires foreign firms to sign up with domestic partners with the right technological capability to take on the prime contractorship, the executive said.

A French Army artillery unit has trained on a Watchkeeper sent over from Britain. Thales unveiled with local partner WB Electronics its offer of an armed version of Watchkeeper to Poland at the MSPO trade show.

A French order of Watchkeeper has been seen as a counterpart to a potential British order of the Nexter VBCI combat and infantry vehicle.

Thales developed the Watchkeeper based on the Elbit Hermes 450 and has delivered the UAV to the British Army. Thales and Elbit formed a UK joint venture respectively owned 49-51 percent.

Sagem has signed a collaborative agreement with Mexican partner Seguritech for joint development of systems including drones in Mexico, the French firm said at the Paris airshow.

Sagem flew the Patroller in the skies over Toulouse, southwest France, last October and November, showing its compliance with European civil aviation rules. That exercise showed the UAV could meet civil and security as well as military needs, the company said.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999673366546631}",neutral,0.9999673366546631,0

The project, which came in $C 90m below its $C 750m budget, also involved installing a new communications-based train control signalling (CBTC) system on 10km of the network and all 94 LRVs which is integrated with the existing ETS signalling system.

However, line speeds over the MacEwan - Nait section are currently limited to 25km/h over straight track sections and 10km/h over points with drivers using line-of-sight signalling following delays with delivering CBTC. The city subsequently appointed independent consultant Hatch Mott MacDonald to come up with the interim solution, which has increased the journey time to 14 minutes compared with the 7 minutes envisaged for the service. The new line is expected to cause extensive traffic delays at level crossings when traffic levels return to normal on September 8 following the Labor Day holiday weekend.

Thales was awarded a $C 45m contract, which subsequently rose to $C 53m, in July 2011 to supply its SelTrac CBTC solution within the city's 32-month timeframe for the project. This was in spite of reported warnings from engineers that the time required for the upgrades would surpass the project's schedule by five to six months.

A city audit of the project issued on August 17 found concerns with the way the city and Thales has handled the project.

The report said that Thales missed deadlines from the start, with equipment not installed on a third of the vehicles at the time of the audit, and a list published in April found 1300 unresolved deficiencies in the system. The report says that the city also failed to manage the project properly with limited communication about expected delays. ""Throughout this project there were poor working relationships, frustrated stakeholders, and conflicting opinions on the state of deliverables,"" says Edmonton auditor Mr Dan Wiun.

Thales responded in a statement that it was not in receipt of an official copy of the safety audit report compiled by the city's consultant for the project, and provided a complete safety case authorising the system for operation but questioned the consultant's understanding of what is required to commission a CBTC system. It also said that it could not endorse the use of line-of-sight on September 6 because there was at that point no indication of the extent that its system would be used for the operations.

It added that 25km/h operation using the Thales system would imply it was safe at this speed and not above. ""This displays a complete lack of understanding of the Thales system,"" the statement said. ""The speed is enforced the same way whether it is 25km/h or at the line speed.""

The City of Edmonton says it will continue to operate the service using line-of-sight until the new signalling system is fully operational.","{'label': 'Negative', 'score': 0.9970933198928833}",negative,0.9970933198928833,-1

Under the 'skills' sub-category, the quality of the nation's maths and science education comes in last place, behind the likes of Haiti, Lesotho, Chad, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, and Kenya.

Recent figures on mathematics in schools show that poor South African pupils might face a bleak future because the country's education system was still not treating them equally, according to Equal Education. In a Parliamentary response, Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga revealed that at least one in four schools around the country did not offer mathematics for Grades 10 to 12.

With this in mind, and in an effort to improve the level of maths and science at schools, the Community Chest hosted the Thales Science Quest 2015 finale at the Cape Town Science Centre where 80 learners from six participating schools competed for the grand prize. The schools involved were Sizimisele, Joe Slovo, Khanyolwethu, Malibu High, Forest Heights High, and Kleinvlei High.

Capacity building

The Quest involved more than 1,200 Grade 9 learners from the six selected schools and formed part of the Thales corporate social investment five-year project 'Fast-tracking Pathways to Success' programme.

Community Chest CEO, Lorenzo Davids, said the aim of the programme was to help build the capacity of schools to improve their performance in maths and basic science subjects.

""There is no denying that we need to promote science, technology, engineering, and mathematics - what educationalists refer to as STEM - in our schools if we are to become a competitive nation,"" said Davids. ""The Science Quest is just such an initiative to encourage learners to engage with science subjects. It is specifically aimed at inspiring learners to choose maths and science subjects in their Grade 10 year.""

""Thales is excited to have the opportunity of investing in STEM's education through this project and creating opportunities for learners to pursue careers in the sciences,"" Thales director of Marketing and Sales, Joe Musandiwa, said.

The winner took home an android tablet - worth R2,500 - while the respective science teacher received a R1,000 Canal Walk gift voucher. Second prize was a R1,000 Canal Walk voucher and R500 for coming third.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9984183311462402}",neutral,0.9984183311462402,0

Julian Kerr | Sydney

Some 700 EF88s from the low rate initial production activity approved by government in September 2014 were issued in June to Townsville-based 1 RAR for derisking activities.

Under Project Land 125 Phase 3C, which received government approval in 2015, over the following five years the EF88 (E for Enhanced) 5.56mm rifle will replace the Austeyr F88 which, with various modifications, has been in service with the ADF since 1988.

Meanwhile the first issues of the SCE, under development for the past five years under Project Land 125 Phase 3B, took place in May to 7 RAR in Adelaide, elements of 1 Brigade in Darwin, and to RAN clearance divers.

The SCE rollout will be completed over three years to what Defence describes as those combatants who need it most, and most often, whether from Special Operations Command, Forces Command, 2nd Division, RAAF, or RAN.

Development of a successor to the F88, manufactured at Lithgow by the then Australian Defence Industries that was subsequently purchased by Thales, was contracted to Thales in 2008.

Provisional design acceptance for the weapon, a substantial development of the F88, was received in April 2014 and second pass approval for Phase 3C expenditure of about $447 million was announced in July this year.

About $100 million will be contracted with Thales for 30,000 rifles and an undisclosed number of integrated Steyr Manlicher SL40 40mm grenade launchers. The balance of $367 million will acquire a broad range of targeting and surveillance ancillaries, support and training aids for the EF88 system.

Army’s key requirements involved weight reduction and improved weapon balance; interoperability with NATO 5.56mm standard ammunition; improved survivability with reduced weapon signature; improved lethality with enhancement to existing Surveillance Target Acquisition ancillaries; and an integrated grenade launcher.

While Army maintains the suitability of the M4 for use in Special Operations Command, it believes the EF88 is a superior weapon for the broader Army and Air Force. This belief is founded in extensive analysis and user trials.

With the addition of its ancillaries, coupled with high quality simulation and range training, Army believes its lethality is expected to be as good, if not better, than any other assault rifle.

""Weapon lasers for the EF88 are planned to be identified by Project Land 53 Phase IBR.""

The EF88 with its standard 20” barrel and underbarrel grenade launcher is around 1.63kg lighter than the F88SA2 variant of the in-service weapon equipped with the current M203 grenade launcher.

While the M203 must be fitted to the F88AS2 by an armourer, the sideloading SL40 can be easily attached to or removed from an EF88 within seconds without any tools or specialised training.

Exhaustive testing of two EF88 initial production batches saw more than one million rounds fired from the second batch of 30 rifles over seven months. Thousands of grenades were also fired from the SL40 during qualification testing, primarily practice grenades but also high explosive, high explosive dual purpose, illumination, smoke, and rubber ball rounds. Low velocity extended range and airburst munitions were also tested without modification to the rifle or launcher.

Design changes

Among numerous design changes, the buttstock now hosts a bolt release catch which obviates the need to retract the cocking handle to release the bolt group after a new magazine is inserted. This measurably reduces the time taken to reload.

A raised cheekpiece on the stock is fitted for but not with a plug-in electrical socket that can be connected to a void in the buttstock able to contain a Thales-developed battery pack. This will provide the capability when required to provide centralised power to the EF88’s Picatinny rail system and help meet Defence’s mandated requirement for future proofing.

One immediately noticeable change is in colour - the EF88 is black rather than the F88’s khaki, although repainting will be allowed by certain combatants; normally part of reconnaissance, sniper, surveillance or joint fire team organisations.

The EF88s, ancillaries and SCE variants will all be issued according to combatant tiers; a first for Army, which has traditionally focused SCE design in particular solely on the requirements of dismounted infantry.

These Tier definitions will equip combatants according to their primary operating task and likelihood of threat encountered.

Tier 0 is a basic SCE configuration specific to Land 125 Phase 3B consisting of baseline belt webbing, assault pack and ballistic and laser eye protection that is issued to all combatants.

Tier 1 is an SCE configuration for unique or specialist combatants who require highly specialised equipment for a particular role. This includes military free fall, diving and concealable systems.

Tier 2 Dismounted are combatants whose role is close combat as part of a dismounted combined arms team, including infantry, joint fires and combat engineers. They may include select signallers and other common attachments to dismounted combined arms teams; RAAF security force squadrons, and RAN clearance diving teams and boarding parties.

Tier 3 General Combatant comprises combatants whose role and tasks are primarily focused on providing combat support and combat service support to combined arms teams, including all corps not included in the Tier 2 definitions and select RAAF non-security force personnel.

Contingent on their role, Tier 2 dismounted personnel will receive a universal enhanced day sight; an in-line image intensifier to enable target detection and engagement by night; an in-line thermal imager to enable target detection and engagement by day/night; grenade launcher; detachable foregrip with extendable bipod legs; bipod (Marksman only); reversionary sights; and a high-powered rifle torch.

Tier 2 Mounted personnel will receive a universal enhanced day sight and a detachable foregrip for their 16” barrel carbine variants.

Tier 3 combatants will receive a universal enhanced day sight, detachable foregrip and, for grenadiers, a grenade launcher.

Weapon lasers for the EF88 are planned to be identified by Project Land 53 Phase IBR which is yet to be considered by government.

A Defence spokesperson said Army was consistently seeking opportunities to enhance the performance and reliability of its ammunition natures, but declined to disclose whether it was testing or buying the new US M855A1 or Thales F9 enhanced performance 5.56mm rounds.

In developing and refining the SCE over the past five years, every pouch, buckle, strap, harness, helmet, hearing protection and protective eyeware has been subject to unprecedented analysis, Lieutenant-Colonel Benjamin McLennan, Staff Officer Combat Development at Army Headquarters said to ADM.

This has included feedback from trials, the combat experience of both special and conventional forces and RAN boarding parties, and constant comparison against alternate leading commercial off-the-shelf options.

Whether the new SCE will restrict the opportunity for soldiers to acquire and use their own equipment has yet to be determined, but “Army has never had so much confidence that the SCE it is providing is functional, integrated, sustainable, and has the confidence of combatants”.

The SCE delivers the Tiered Body Armour System (TBAS) ballistic plate carriers in a Tier 2 and Tier 3 design.

Both provide a platform for the carriage of protective equipment, including two types of hard armour plates, one of which defeats high velocity rounds and one which defeats armour-piercing rounds; together with soft armour inserts which defeat low velocity rounds, fragmentation and blunt force trauma as well as supporting the hard armour plates.

Also included are edged blade/spike inserts which defeat piercing and slashing hand weapons as well as blunt force trauma, and extremity protection against low velocity rounds and fragmentation.

The Tier 3 TBAS plate carrier provides additional coverage of the combatant for greater protection, while the Tier 2 carrier maximises mobility.

Both tiers include Modular Lightweight Load Carriage Equipment (MOLLE). This allows the attachment of other role-specific pouches directly onto the plate carriers; apart from protection capability the primary differential between the various elements of Tiers 2 and 3.

The initial Tier 2 Combat Helmet provides protection against fragmentation and blunt force trauma while providing maximum levels of integration and weight reduction. The Tier 3 combat helmet also provides protection against fragmentation and blunt force trauma, involving a different balance between weight, integration and protection.

The initial Tier 2 combat hearing protection uses an over-ear protection system and external microphones to enable active listening, and also integrates with service radios, providing an increased level of situational awareness. The existing ballistic and laser eye protection system is being incorporated in the SCE.

“Operational feedback/lessons learned have validated the level of protection afforded by Land 125 Ph3B and the need to allow combatants and their commanders to up/downscale their level of protection according to mission,” LTCOL McLennan stated.

The Army Reserve’s multi-role battlegroups, which provide force generation alongside each of the Regular Army’s three combat brigades under Plan Beersheba, will receive the SCE during the ensemble’s three-year rollout.

“Army is very serious about providing SCE to those who need it most - including those from the 2nd Division,” LTCOL McLennan commented.

Spiral development compels Army, Capability Acquisition and Development Group and other stakeholders to constantly scrutinise the design, functionality, integration and ergonomics of the SCE being delivered.

“I expect key future developments in SCE will include lighter, and perhaps hybrid, protective equipment and a Tiered Combat Helmet; more functional load carriage equipment that optimises the balance between protection, load carriage and mobility; and improvements/adaptations in order to maximise integration with emerging projects,” LTCOL McLennan forecasted to ADM.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9579543471336365}",neutral,0.9579543471336365,0
