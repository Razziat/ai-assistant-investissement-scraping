Thales: First Export of Spanish mini-UAV Fulmar - Defense News,"Wed, 16 Mar 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuc2VuZXdzLmNvbS9haXIvMjAxNi8wMy8xNi90aGFsZXMtZmlyc3QtZXhwb3J0LW9mLXNwYW5pc2gtbWluaS11YXYtZnVsbWFyL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MADRID — Thales has been awarded a contract by a Malaysian shipbuilder to build six Fulmar UAVs. The Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency will be the final client and will use the remotely piloted aircraft for surveillance, reconnaissance and border control missions, industry sources said.

At the request of the customer, Thales has not publicly announced the deal.

This is the first export of the Fulmar, which is classified in the mini-UAV category. Fulmar is designed and built in Spain by the Spanish branch of Thales. The UAV is 3.1 meters long and weighs 19 kilograms, can fly at an altitude of 3,000 meters and achieve a speed of 150 kilometers per hour.

Fulmar has eight hours of endurance due to low fuel consumption and can fly 800 kilometers without refueling. The value has not been revealed, but industry sources said Fulmar could cost US $1.1 million.

""Its dual use makes it a very versatile solution for both civil uses [traffic control, surveillance of rail lines, tracking fish stocks, surveillance of critical infrastructure like gas pipelines, oil facilities, etc.] and military use,"" a Thales executive engineer said.

Fulmar works with a catapult-based launcher system and net landing capability. It is available for use with a variety of fuel types such as diesel oil, JP8 and JP5, approved for use on combat ships.

The Spanish branch of Thales is trying to push the use of Fulmar by the Military Emergencies Unit and the Naval Infantry Force of the Spanish armed forces. For that reason Thales expects to build 25 Fulmars in two years.

Under the contract to upgrade the SOCRATE network, which is a core component of the infrastructure, Thales will provide a highly

resilient and scalable high-data-rate network incorporating the latest

technological advances and designed to cope with the growing number and severity of cyberthreats.

The upgraded network will interconnect over 250,000 users at more than 100 strategic sites, including Hexagone-Balard, the new Ministry of Defence headquarters in Paris. The project will ensure continuity of the French military’s most important operational missions, from nuclear deterrence to joint forces command and the country’s permanent air security presence.

The contract is a further endorsement of Thales’s unique ability to design, deploy and maintain the most critical communication systems. Comprising 270 routers, 10,000 km of fibre-optic cable and more than 100 pieces of high-capacity optical equipment, the network will also incorporate the Nexium View solution from Thales. Nexium View will enable the Ministry of Defence’s IT and communications agency (DIRISI) to supervise all aspects of the network in real-time, respond faster to incidents and anticipate their impact on operations.

Thales has also been awarded the POINCARE contract, in partnership with NextiraOne, to securely interconnect the Ministry of Defence’s 1,200 sites in mainland France and overseas.

Deliveries under the SOCRATE upgrade contract will begin in 2017 and will continue until 2021. Rollout of the POINCARE network will be completed in 2018.

The Thales solutions deployed for the DESCARTES programme are designed to meet the demands from governments, international organisations and critical infrastructure operators for secure, resilient high-data-rate networks and interconnections that are fully scalable and supervised in real-time.

Radmor and Thales - 20 Years of Cooperation. Joint Effort Undertaken Within The European ESSOR Programme. - Defence24.com,"Tue, 15 Mar 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5jZTI0LmNvbS9yYWRtb3ItYW5kLXRoYWxlcy0yMC15ZWFycy1vZi1jb29wZXJhdGlvbi1qb2ludC1lZmZvcnQtdW5kZXJ0YWtlbi13aXRoaW4tdGhlLWV1cm9wZWFuLWVzc29yLXByb2dyYW1tZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Cooperation between Radmor and Thales has been initiated back in 1996, when a pertaining agreement was signed by Radmor, with the French Thomson company which, later, became a part of the Thales enterprise. A year later, a transfer of technology was carried out. The procedure concerned the PR4G radios-related know-how for Radmor. This paved the way towards implementation of modern tactical communications systems in the Polish Armed Forces.

In 2007 Thales and Radmor realized a technology transfer related to the PR4G F@stnet radios. During the event which took place on Friday, 11th March, an announcement was made that implementation of the latest digital waveform version, also known as “Geomux”, has been carried out. This will make it possible to continue the digitalization process of the C4ISR systems used in the Polish Army. It was noted that the Polish users have already received 10 thousand examples of the PR4G device.

Two decades of collaboration with the Thales Group were fruitful, as they led to numerous positive changes in our company. We are able to offer state of the art equipment for the Polish Army, not only is this equipment manufactured domestically, but it is also being perfected by the Polish facilities. The bilateral collaboration with Thales, as well as joint works realized within the framework of the European ESSOR initiative, allow us to gain expertise required to develop a national communications platform which would meet the requirements of the Polish Armed Forces. I do hope that the upcoming years will also be beneficial for our companies.

President of the Board and General Director of the Radmor company, Andrzej Synowiecki, emphasized the fact that the collaboration with Thales, within the framework of the ESSOR initiative, makes it possible to develop solutions that are going to later become a part of the offer, targeted at the Polish Armed Forces. On the other hand, Paweł Piotrowski, Thales Polska’s President of the Board noted that cooperation with Radmor constitutes an example of the Thales company’s involvement in the support activities addressed at the Polish industry, the aim of which is to provide the Polish facilities with a relevant transfer of technology. Piotrowski also announced that the cooperation is going to be continued, “in order to meet the needs created within the Polish Armed Forces modernization plan”.

At the moment, both Radmor, as well as Thales, are actively involved in the ESSOR project (European Secure Software Defined Radio). Within the scope of the aforementioned initiative, six European suppliers work together, in order to construct a European standard for the SDR platforms. Secondly, the research is focused on development of a coalition network “waveform”. The aim of the process is to provide the users with high data throughput capacities. The initial phase of the initiative came to an end last year.

Not only are the communication suites manufactured by Radmor being used by the Polish soldiers, as they are also a part of the inventory of the Czech, Slovak, Latvian, Lithuanian and Estonian armies. Outside the territory of Europe, Radmor radios are also utilized e.g. in Bangladesh.

Radmor's heritage dates back to 1947, at the moment 99 percent of the company shares are owned by the WB Electronics group. The offer for the Armed Forces includes programmable R3507 radios, R35010 personal radios, R3501 hand-held radios, V3501 mobile radios, along with backpack and onboard F@stnet devices with the relevant accessory bundles. The Polish enterprise also works within numerous European R&D programmes (such as ESSOR). Moreover, Radmor is an active participant of the Polish programme, the goal of which is to modernize the tactical communication suites.

Thales is the prime contractor under the $63.1 million award from Britain's Ministry of Defense and will conduct the design, build and operation of the training service, which is set to open in 2018.

AMST will provide the design, technical and engineering capability for a human training centrifuge, which allows pilots to build and maintain their ability to withstand high G-force in a safe environment.

""The relationship between Thales and AMST is built on our complimentary capabilities and we are delighted that this has been recognized by the UK MoD in the award of this contract,"" said Peter Hitchcock, Thales vice president in charge of avionics activities."
Thales and BEL-Thales Systems Limited to develop PHAROS fire control radar - Indian Defence Review,"Tue, 29 Mar 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhbmRlZmVuY2VyZXZpZXcuY29tL25ld3MvdGhhbGVzLWFuZC1iZWwtdGhhbGVzLXN5c3RlbXMtbGltaXRlZC10by1kZXZlbG9wLXBoYXJvcy1maXJlLWNvbnRyb2wtcmFkYXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,".

Strategic cooperation contract in India.

New type of multi-target simultaneous engagement fire control radar for naval and ground-based deployment that offers control of conventional and guided ammunition.

At Defexpo India 2016, Thales and BEL-Thales Systems Limited (BTSL), the joint venture between Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) and Thales, have signed a partnership agreement for the joint development of the PHAROS fire control radar.

This strategic co-operation contract will allow Thales and BTSL to jointly develop PHAROS, a fire control radar for both gun and missile systems. PHAROS provides defence against small, fast moving and highly manoeuvrable air and surface targets that may also be encountered in littoral missions. The multiple target tracker is capable of simultaneously controlling — in all weather conditions — the engagement of these targets with guided ammunition.

This joint development will strengthen the co-operation of Thales and BTSL in the field of innovative technologies. The responsibility of overall system design will be borne by Thales. BTSL will develop the mechanical design and radar processing modifications while Thales will be responsible for the design and production of the radar antenna.

BTSL will carry out its share of the development work in Bengaluru. This co-development agreement between Thales and BTSL is in line with the ‘Make in India’ vision of the Government of India.

The jointly developed PHAROS system will cater to both domestic Indian and international market requirements.

“We are pleased to work in close collaboration with BTSL for the development of this new type of fire control sensor to address the needs of the Indian and global markets. This strategic step goes beyond the co-development partnership; it reaffirms our commitment to the country and to actively contribute to the ‘Make in India’ policy,” said Serge Adrian, Senior Vice President of Surface Radars Activities at Thales."

Adam Laughlin, general manager of integrated infrastructure service, said he expects the report by Rail Safety Consultants will allow the system to move to full capacity.

However, he said this timeline depends on whether the rest of the audit uncovers issues that can't be resolved.

Since the last update in December, Laughlin said new equipment has been installed on all 94 trains and Thales has installed new software in the control centre.

The city has also improved signalling at intersections around the Kingsway and NAIT transit stations.

Not everything is perfect. There are still problems with crossing gates not coming down quickly enough and a loss of communication along the line has caused trains to stop, Laughlin said.

In February, there were two breakdowns that created 10-minute delays. In November, signalling problems caused 11 service delays.

Trains were originally supposed to start running from Churchill Station to NAIT in April 2014. But problems with the signalling system postponed the opening several times.

Since September, trains have been operating at reduced frequency at a maximum of 25 km/h, giving operators enough distance to stop if they see something on the tracks.

Last fall, Rail Safety Consultants started a deeper audit of Thales to verify the safety of its software after an initial assessment found more work was required.

Mayor Don Iveson was optimistic about the progress that was being made and that the city can sign off on the safety audit soon after it is submitted in May.

However, he says it could be a few more months before the trains run more often.

""Full frequency will take a little bit more work, but hopefully we will be able to turn up to full speed,"" Iveson said, noting that will reduce the negative impact on intersections because the trains will be moving through faster."

Thales on Wednesday announced that it will supply Wide Area Multilateration (WAM), Star NG (Next Generation) primary radars and RSM 970 secondary radars. The WAM system will be deployed to provide surveillance over the entire Northern region of South Africa. Radars will be deployed to Johannesburg O.R. Tambo International Airport, Cape Town, Durban and Blesberg in KwaZulu-Natal.

These surveillance systems will be integrated into ATNS’s existing Thales TopSky Air Traffic Management System.

Thales added that DME systems will be deployed to 31 sites across South Africa where they will ensure high accuracy en-route and terminal aircraft guidance.

Together, these technologies will improve ATNS’ capability to offer airlines RNAV routes for faster and shorter trajectories, lower fuel consumption, and reduced carbon emissions. (RNAV or Area navigation is a method of instrument flight rules (IFR) navigation that allows an aircraft to choose any course within a network of navigation beacons, rather than navigate directly to and from the beacons.)

In addition to the supply, installation and commissioning of the new air traffic hardware, these contracts provide for a long term support and maintenance agreement.

Thabani Mthiyane, CEO of ATNS, said that “ATNS has invested in the acquisition of new and advanced technology for Air Traffic Management to replace the current national Air Traffic Management Automation system. Through this programme, ATNS will enter a new era of operational technology advancement for the benefit of the ATM community. The South African aviation infrastructure is considered to be one of the best in the world, contributing to the country’s aviation safety record. It is, therefore, imperative that we continue to invest wisely in this infrastructure to support the country’s overall transport infrastructure”.

Justice Tootla, Thales South Africa Systems, CEO, said that, “South Africa is one of the fastest growing ATM regions in the continent. As a result of Thales’ commitment to aligning our product roadmaps with international standards, Thales navigation and surveillance solutions will allow ATNS to deploy a truly future-proofed technology capable of not only dealing with the issues and challenges of Africa today, but also capable of growing and adapting as the airspace becomes more complex.”

Thales noted that over the past decade, African air traffic has increased exponentially, with South Africa being one of the busiest airspaces in the continent.

In May 2013 Thales announced it had been awarded several contracts to upgrade some of South Africa’s air traffic management infrastructure, replacing legacy equipment with its TopSky air traffic control (ATC) systems. The company was also contracted to install Thales RSM 970 S radars at the Wakkerstroom, Potgieterus and Rhodes sites.

ATNS is the sole provider of air traffic, navigation and training services within South Africa and some parts of Africa and is responsible for 10% of the world’s airspace."
£886m Bill For TfL Following Failed Tube Upgrade Contract - Londonist,"Thu, 17 Mar 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vbG9uZG9uaXN0LmNvbS8yMDE2LzAzL3NpZ25hbGxpbmctY29udHJhY3TSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Rachel Holdsworth

£886m Bill For TfL Following Failed Tube Upgrade Contract

Photo by Jack Gordon from the Londonist Flickr pool.

Transport for London's bumbling over upgrading the sub surface tube lines will cost London hundreds of millions of pounds.

That's not our assessment, by the way. It's that of the London Assembly, which has been looking into the failed contract between TfL and Bombardier to upgrade the Circle, District, Metropolitan and Hammersmith and City lines, which collapsed in 2013.

Bombardier was appointed in 2011 and was supposed to supply a new signalling system to allow automatic train control (ATC). London Underground says Bombardier

presented so-called experience and so-called expertise that they did not have, subsequently we found out, so there is no doubt that at the outset of the programme they did not have the capability of delivering it, although they said they did.

In short, TfL believes it was ""duped"" by the engineering company.

Thales, which took over the contract last year, is now working on something entirely different — because the system Bombardier said it could build, simply did not work.

However, the London Assembly believes TfL didn't have the internal expertise to assess whether or not Bombardier were able to deliver what they promised. The farce also dragged on for longer than it should because, the Assembly believes, there was a culture of 'good news' at TfL.

These failures mean the project is now five years behind schedule, meaning more congested journeys and quite simply, fewer people willing or able to travel.

How much will this cost?

TfL estimates it will lose £271m in fares income, and that London will lose around £180m a year that would have been added to the economy had the upgrades been completed as planned. To add insult to injury, TfL paid Bombardier £85m to get out of the contract.

And then the big one: TfL now has £886m less to spend on infrastructure projects than it thought it did.

To put that into context, the Northern line extension to Battersea is projected to cost £998.9m. The north-south segregated cycle superhighway cost £17m. The Rotherhithe-Canary Wharf bridge is estimated to cost £88m. How many future projects will have to be shelved?

Don't bank on it not happening again

There are some other lessons here, too. Bombardier was selected under a procurement process that KPMG found to be not well thought out. The scoring system was flawed and EU best practice guidelines weren't followed.

(This reminds us a lot of criticisms of the process to select Heatherwick Studios to design a certain Garden Bridge...)

But there's also the issue of expertise within TfL. The lack of people in public office who are highly knowledgeable about specialist areas has been highlighted with housing, as councils are unable to outwrangle developers' legal teams over viability studies and affordable homes. Now it turns out TfL doesn't have the legal or risk assessment skills to properly manage a project this complex.

So just hire better people, right?

Except the mayoral frontrunner, Sadiq Khan, is campaigning on a platform of paying for fare freezes by cutting the ""flab"" from TfL and cutting the cash available for consultants. You know, the people with the specialist abilities to spot things like the Bombardier cock-up.

Is the Labour candidate promising false efficiencies?

This article has been amended to correct a confusion over the cost of the cycle superhighway budget overall and the north-south cycle superhighway."

The Sentinel-3A was realized by Thales Alenia Space, which is a joint venture between Thales (67%) and Finmeccanica (33%) on behalf of the European Space Agency (ESA). It was launched recently from the Pleseck Cosmodrome in Russia, with a Rokot launcher, thus adding to the European constellation of satellites for observing the Earth. The Sentinel-3A satellite will systematically cover all the land and ocean areas. The data collected by the satellite will contribute to improving forecasts on changes in the oceans and the atmosphere.

Sentinel 3-A’s job

The Sentinel 3-A will help us to better understand the condition of our oceans, to manage the fishing industry, agriculture, forestry, biodiversity, water resources, public health, food production and our security, as well as to monitor, in a timely manner, changes in sea levels and the melting the Arctic Sea ice. The launch of Sentinel-3A follows the launching of the Sentinel-1A satellite on the 3rd of April 2014. An uninterrupted supply of data will be guaranteed by the other satellites of the two families, Sentinel-1B/C/D and Sentinel-3B/C/D, all designed by the prime contractor Thales Alenia Space.

The Copernicus programme

The User Driven European Copernicus Earth Observation Programme, formerly known as GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security), is a complex set of systems that collects information from multiple sources, i.e. satellites that observe the Earth and land, sea and airborne sensors. It integrates and processes all this information, providing institutions and the industrial sector with reliable and up-to-date information through a series of services related to the environment, the territory and security. One of the objectives of Copernicus is to guarantee Europe substantial independence in the detection and management of data on the state of health of the planet, supporting the needs of European public policies through the provision of accurate and reliable services. The services are divided into six thematic areas: the land, the sea, the atmosphere, climate change, emergency management and security.

The craft, part of the European-Russian ExoMars programme, is to lift off from the Baikonur spaceport in Kazakhstan on board a Proton rocket at 5:31 A.M. EDT (0931 GMT) on Monday, starting a seven-month journey through space. It will carry an atmospheric probe that will study trace gases, such as methane, around Mars as well as a lander that will test technologies needed for a rover due to follow in 2018.

US space agency NASA's Mars rover Curiosity in late 2014 found spurts of methane gas in the planet's atmosphere, a chemical that on Earth is strongly tied to life. Scientists believe the methane could stem from micro-organisms, called methanogenes, that either became extinct millions of years ago and left gas frozen below the planet's surface, or that some methane-producing organisms still survive.

""Proving that life exists or has existed on Mars would show that Earth is not unique in terms of having life on it,"" Rolf de Groot, head of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Robotic Exploration Coordination Office, told Reuters. ""That would make it much more likely that there are other places in the universe that also have life,"" he added.

Another explanation for the methane in Mars's atmosphere could be that it is produced by geological phenomena, like the oxidation of iron.

The second part of the ExoMars mission in 2018 will deliver a European rover to the surface of Mars. It will be the first with the ability to both move across the planet's surface and drill into the ground to collect and analyse samples.

""The radiation from space destroys all the biological material. If you go two metres into the ground you may be able to find places that were protected (from radiation),"" de Groot said.

Landing on Mars is a notoriously difficult task that has bedevilled nearly all of Russia's previous efforts and has given NASA trouble as well. The United States currently has two operational rovers on Mars, Curiosity and Opportunity.

The ExoMars 2016 mission is led by ESA, with Russia's Roscosmos supplying the launcher and two of the four scientific instruments on the trace gas orbiter.

The prime contractor is Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales and Finmeccanica. The cost of the ExoMars mission to ESA, including the second part due in 2018, is expected to be about 1.3 billion euros ($1.4 billion).

Russia's contribution comes on top of that. In 2018, NASA also plans to launch a Mars spacecraft, a satellite known as InSight and designed to study the deep interior of Mars, the US agency said this week."

On 9 March, a major milestone in the development of SMART-L EWC was reached: installed on a test tower in Hengelo, the demonstration module produced its first air picture.

Looking to the west in a 90 degree angle, the radar provided a clear image of the sky over the Netherlands, the North Sea and a part of the UK.

After all systems were switched on for the first time the screen in the control room instantaneously filled with more than a hundred aircraft tracks. Proof that the radar works as expected. The system is operating in AAW mode, with an instrumented range of 480 km. In the course of this year, work on de demonstration module will continue and its performance will increase. Towards the end of the year we expect to be able to operate the system in Ballistic Missile Defence mode, with a range of 2000 km.

In 2012 Thales received a contract from the Royal Netherlands Navy for the update of the four SMART-L volume search radars on board of the De Zeven Provinciën class vessels. This update is to increase the radar’s range to 2000 km, making this sensor suitable for the early detection of ballistic missiles. The first SMART-L EWC (Early Warning Capability) is expected to be installed on board of the ship in 2018.

In 2015 the Royal Netherlands Air Force contracted two ground-based SMART-L EWC systems as replacements for the aging MPR sensors that are presently guarding the Netherlands’ air space. Together with this contract, the Defence Materiel Organization and Thales signed a contract that committed Thales to all maintenance activities of the four naval and the two ground-based SMART-L EWC systems.

Thales positive about SANDF projects - defenceWeb,"Thu, 17 Mar 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuY2V3ZWIuY28uemEvaW5kdXN0cnkvaW5kdXN0cnktaW5kdXN0cnkvdGhhbGVzLXBvc2l0aXZlLWFib3V0LXNhbmRmLXByb2plY3RzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales is expecting to benefit from extensive South African National Defence Force (SANDF) contracts, and hopes to supply vessel combat management suites and radars for Projects Biro and Chutney.

Justice Tootla, CEO of Thales South Africa Systems, told defenceWeb that his company is hopeful regarding Biro, which calls for three offshore and three inshore patrol vessels for the South African Navy. Thales would offers its services as a systems integrator to shipyards and provide the combat management systems, as it did with the SA Navy’s four Meko frigates.

As it has a strong combat management systems background, Thales South Africa is currently doing integration work on the French Navy FREMM frigates, and provided equipment for the FREMM that was delivered to Egypt last year. This involves providing bridge equipment for these vessels.

Tootla said that although SANDF spending has been “very subdued” due to the limited defence budget, the 2014 Defence Review could see more participation from Thales. At the moment Thales South Africa has support contracts in place with the SANDF as it has done work on the Meko frigates, provided surveillance and communications equipment (Squire radars and Sophie thermal imagers amongst other items) to the Army under Project Cytoon, and supplied artillery fire control systems to the Army under Project Klooster.

Tootla said he was also hopeful that the Air Force’s Project Chutney, to replace its ground based radars, would move forward and was optimistic of project requirements being released this year. Thales would offer the Ground Master 400 radar, with a range of 560 kilometres, as its top of the line product, but would also offer items like its medium range Ground Master 200, depending on the specifications.

Another SANDF project that Thales has its eye on is Sepula for new armoured personnel carriers for the Army, replacing some Mambas and Casspirs, but Tootla said it was unlikely this will be happening very soon. At the moment the SA Army is refurbishing its vehicle fleet in lieu of replacing it with new equipment.

On the defence side, Tootla said Thales South Africa Systems has increased its exports into the Middle East, after focussing on this area several years ago. He said there is a strong export pipeline in the Middle East, with a number of recent orders. Most exports are on the landward side, for equipment like the company’s AS4000 artillery fire control system, which was also used for Project Klooster. Defence sales in Africa have been quieter, although Thales is heavily marketing its Scorpion automated mortar system. The company is also pushing partnerships with African countries.

Thales South Africa has been active on the commercial side and recently signed a large contract with South Africa’s Air Traffic and Navigation Services (ATNS) company to provide radars and other air traffic management (ATM) equipment. Tootla said this is a two to three year project. The company’s relationship with ATNS goes back more than 30 years, as it has supplied various air traffic management systems that have been progressively upgraded as technology and regulations change. For instance, ATNS awarded Thales a contract in 2013 for its TopSky ATM system.

Under the contract announced earlier this month, Thales will supply Wide Area Multilateration (WAM), Star NG (Next Generation) primary radars and RSM 970 secondary radars to ATNS. The WAM system will be deployed to provide surveillance over the entire Northern region of South Africa. Radars will be deployed to Johannesburg OR Tambo International Airport, Cape Town, Durban and Blesberg in KwaZulu-Natal. These surveillance systems will be integrated into ATNS’s existing Thales TopSky Air Traffic Management System. Distance measuring equipment (DME) systems will be deployed to 31 sites across South Africa where they will ensure high accuracy en-route and terminal aircraft guidance.

Thales was awarded a contract by construction company Basil Read to supply an instrument landing system (ILS), DME equipment and a Doppler VHF Omni-directional Radio Range system (DVOR) for the new airport at St Helena, which should be opened around May this year. This was a collaboration between Thales UK and Thales South Africa.

Thales has also provided air traffic management equipment to countries like Namibia, Mauritius and Kenya. Egypt this month awarded the company’s regional division a contract to replace and renew its air traffic management systems at Hurghada and Taba International Airports, with the French division supplying TopSky -ATC, TopSky – Tower, primary and secondary radars, and communication systems.

Tootla told defenceWeb that Thales had recently branched out into security and transport, and is active in the rail sector. The company provided the ticketing system for the Gautrain, and is upgrading it so that passengers can use their credit cards to pay for rides in addition to Gautrain Gold Cards. The South African division is also working on train signalling systems for 42 stations in the Western Cape. This R1.8 billion five year contract has been underway for the last two years for the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa)."
Thales Introduces Police Semiautomatic F90 - The Firearm Blog,"Mon, 28 Mar 2016 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZpcmVhcm1ibG9nLmNvbS9ibG9nLzIwMTYvMDMvMjgvdGhhbGVzLWludHJvZHVjZXMtY2l2aWxpYW4tc2VtaWF1dG9tYXRpYy1mOTAv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"News from IWA 2016, Lithgow Arms, the small arms division of Australian defense conglomerate Thales, and former government arsenal, has announced that they will be offering a semiautomatic version of their F90 military rifle for the law enforcement/police market, as a patrol rifle. The F90 was developed by Thales to replace the AUG F88 Austeyr bullpup rifle, upon which it is based.

There’s no mention yet of the F90-LE, as the semiauto-only variant is called, being available for civilian markets, nor of the possibility of the rifle being imported to the United States. However, I think anything is possible, if the demand is high enough.

The F90 is improved versus the Steyr AUG in that it has a lightened, fluted free-floated non-removable barrel, full-length top Picatinny rail, and a redesigned plastic housing with improved cheek weld and provisions for an attachable 40mm grenade launcher, also designed by Thales.

The F90 will replace the aging F88 version of the Austrian Steyr bullpup rifle, which was adopted in 1988 by both the Australian and New Zealand Defence Forces and which was also produced by Thales. Unlike the Australians, the New Zealand Defence Force are replacing their Steyr rifles with Lewis Machine & Tool’s new MARS-L rifle, based on the venerable AR-15.
