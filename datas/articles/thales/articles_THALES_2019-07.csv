Thales on Track with FASGW(L) / LMM / Martlet Program for Royal Navy's Wildcat Helicopters - Naval News,"Thu, 18 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYXZhbG5ld3MuY29tL25hdmFsLW5ld3MvMjAxOS8wNy90aGFsZXMtb24tdHJhY2std2l0aC1mYXNnd2wtbG1tLW1hcnRsZXQtcHJvZ3JhbS1mb3Itcm95YWwtbmF2eXMtd2lsZGNhdC1oZWxpY29wdGVycy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales on Track with FASGW(L) / LMM / Martlet Program for Royal Navy’s Wildcat Helicopters Thales recently conducted firing trials at Royal Artillery Air Defence Range at Manorbier as part of the Integration testing phase of the Future Anti Surface Guided Weapon (Light), (FASGW(L) programme.

The FASGW(L) programme includes testing of all parts of the weapon system including the Lightweight Multirole Missile (LMM), the launcher system and all key equipment of the Wildcat helicopter.

The LMM, which the Royal Navy will call Martlet when it enters service in 2020, will provide an enhanced level of protection for both service personnel in the Royal Navy and vital assets at sea, such as the Queen Elizabeth Carrier.

The trials consisted of 6 LMMs being fired from the Thales designed Launcher system at a small boat target at sea at a distance of 4.5kms. All missiles were test rounds with no warhead, but were fitted with telemetry software enabling data to be gathered to analyse the launcher, the guidance system and missile performance.

The FASGW(L) system accurately guided all missiles to the targets and provided extensive data on the excellent performance of all elements of the ground set-up and inflight performance of the missile.

The successful achievement of the ground firings is a major milestone and key to progressing to future testing including air firing trials later in 2019 and culminating in qualification and verification in 2020.

When it enters service in 2020 LMM will give the Wildcat increased protection capability able to address highly mobile maritime threats such as weaponised speed boats and jet skis.

Earlier this month, the Royal Navy announced that they test fired the same Martlet missile from a Type 23 frigate."
Apollo 11 mission: destination Moon for Angénieux - Thales,"Tue, 16 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvc3BhY2UvbWFnYXppbmUvYXBvbGxvLTExLW1pc3Npb24tZGVzdGluYXRpb24tbW9vbi1hbmdlbmlldXjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"“Fly Me to the Moon,” Frank Sinatra famously sang in 1964; On 20 July 1969 that dream became a reality, when the Apollo 11 astronauts played the song after touching down on the Moon. As we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the landing, Thales is proud to have been a witness to this conquest, in more ways than one.

While Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong were the first humans to walk on the Moon, and Sinatra’s hit was the first music heard there, a small French company played a key role in this historical event. The lenses made by Angénieux, a Thales group brand since 1993, were part of the equipment aboard the Apollo 11 mission designed to film this historic event. It had been a big challenge for the French company to meet the specifications. The lenses needed to be small, lightweight, and easy to use by astronauts operating in a space environment.

“In space, there is no room for error; it is impossible to intervene in the event of technical failure. There was no way that a speck of dust was going to disrupt the broadcast of such strategic images,” said Christophe Remontet – Head of Cinema Optics Segment, Cinema Optics Product Line manager at Angénieux.

Angénieux had to transform its lenses to make them compatible with the new colour camera used on the Apollo 11 mission, it had to make special glass treatments to resist space radiation, and create a new mechanical processing method to prevent the grease - usually used on earth - evaporating in a vacuum and fogging the lenses. These lenses had to be resistant enough to withstand the vibrations and heat released when the rocket launched.

It was therefore anything but a coincidence that NASA chose the French company. Angénieux had become well-known in the U.S. during the sixties, as its lenses were very successful in Hollywood and the company had already worked for the US TV industry. Five years before the Moon landing, three of the six lenses aboard the Ranger 7 spacecraft, which shot the first close-range images of the Moon, were manufactured by Angénieux.

“Working for a customer as demanding and as prestigious as NASA has undoubtedly helped us to be better,” said Christophe Remontet.

Angénieux, which was involved in all the Apollo missions following Apollo 11, has also worked alongside NASA right through to the Dawn mission - dedicated to exploring Vesta and Ceres, located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter - which ended last November.

Whilst its current ranges of products, such as cinema zoom lenses or Thales night vision devices, benefit greatly from the experience with NASA, the developments made for the Dawn mission have pushed the company to further improve its optical cleaning processes. In addition, Angénieux has developed products designed to withstand increasingly demanding conditions, such as its latest onboard lenses, which are made from titanium and able to operate in temperatures ranging from -50° C to + 40° C.

Belgium chooses Thales for onboard intelligence and future data capabilities of its land forces - EDR Magazine,"Tue, 16 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmV1L2JlbGdpdW0tY2hvb3Nlcy10aGFsZXMtZm9yLW9uYm9hcmQtaW50ZWxsaWdlbmNlLWFuZC1mdXR1cmUtZGF0YS1jYXBhYmlsaXRpZXMtb2YtaXRzLWxhbmQtZm9yY2Vz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"16 July 2019 – Further to the CaMo (Capacité Motorisée) government-to-government agreement signed by France and Belgium at the end of 2018, Thales began work on the initial CaMo capability on 26 June 2019 to provide vehicle electronics for Scorpion vehicles. The order covers 382 Griffon multi-role armoured vehicles (VBMR) and 60 Jaguar reconnaissance and combat vehicles (EBRC) to be supplied in partnership with Arquus and Nexter.

As the French industry leader in intelligent onboard systems, Thales will provide the comprehensive range of data capabilities needed to engage the vehicles in future data capabilities in combat. This includes common vetronics and communication systems based on the CONTACT software defined radio (called SYNAPS in export markets).

With Thales digital technologies on board, the vehicles will be ready for the collaborative combat of tomorrow.

The CaMo contract awarded by the French defence procurement agency (DGA) on behalf of Belgium includes 60 Jaguar reconnaissance and combat vehicles (EBRC) and 382 Griffon multi-role armoured vehicles (VBMR). As with France’s Scorpion programme, under this contract Thales is in charge of common combat vetronics, including communications, onboard computing and decision support solutions, and perimeter vision, self-protection and navigation systems. This unprecedented level of cooperation between the Belgian and French land forces is a strategic enabler for combat engagements by European armed forces.

Vehicle crews are particularly exposed to threats in the battlespace. To stay better protected and operate more effectively, they need to understand, decide and act faster than the adversary. To shorten the time it takes to detect and neutralise threats, information must therefore be shared as quickly as possible. Thales‘s digital expertise will enable the land forces to be better protected thanks to the use of the latest high-tech equipment.

As with France’s Scorpion programme, Thales will provide the comprehensive range of data capabilities needed to engage the vehicles in collaborative combat. This includes the common vetronics, which leverages onboard computing power, ties together all the navigation, protection, observation and communication systems, and provides comprehensive in-vehicle data management and data fusion capabilities. The CONTACT software defined radio (called SYNAPS in export markets) provides the real-time communications needed for the forces to operate as a network. Thales will also provide the ANTARES 360° vision system, with its integrated laser warning function and future incoming missile detection capability, to display local situation awareness on a screen inside the vehicle. The ECLIPSE new-generation active counter-IED system is built around a new-generation jammer that prevents improvised explosive devices from being detonated by remote control. Thales’s TopAxyz inertial navigation system, which will equip the Jaguar vehicles, is used to measure platform attitude and position even in the toughest operational conditions.

The systems are connected to the central information system and limit the exposure of combatants to potential threats, giving units a decisive advantage and extending their intelligence gathering and response capabilities. The fact that these information and communication systems are part of this initial capability opens up numerous possibilities for other CaMo capabilities, in that dismounted infantry would be able to exchange information securely and in real time with all other assets in the battlespace to access information from other combatants and vehicles.

The operational component of the government-level partnership includes instruction and training and the development of a capability sustainment plan.

“Thanks to Thales’s contribution to this programme, Belgium’s new vehicles will have all the latest technologies required for land combat. Thales’s expertise in vehicle digitalisation and connectivity is helping to propel Belgium’s operational capabilities forward into the future.” Marc Darmon, Executive Vice-President, Secure Communication and Information Systems.

(MAXR) shares rose more than 13% during Tuesday's session after Reuters reported that Leonardo SpA and Thales SA were considering a joint bid for its MDA space business. The two companies already operate a joint venture, Thales Alenia Space, that's a Maxar customer using MDA technology. The acquisition would provide the companies with high-quality antennas for satellites.

Earlier this year, Maxar announced that it was considering the sale of its space robotics business, which could net more than $1 billion and enable it to pay down some of its $3.2 billion in debt. With shares half off of their highs for the year following the failure of its WorldView-4 satellite in January, investors are looking for ways to deleverage the balance sheet and refocus on growth.

Last quarter, the company reported revenue that fell 9.6%, driven by the Space Systems segment and the loss of the WorldView-4 satellite, although this was better than analysts were expecting to see. Net losses fell to $59 million compared to a $15 million gain a year earlier.

TrendSpider

From a technical standpoint, the stock broke out from prior highs made in May. The relative strength index (RSI) moved into overbought territory with a reading of 74.59, but the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) remains relatively neutral. These indicators suggest that the stock could see some near-term consolidation before resuming its uptrend over the coming days and weeks.

Traders should watch for a close above prior highs at around $9.00, which could become a key support level over the coming sessions. After a prior of consolidation, traders should watch for an ongoing move higher toward $13.00. If the stock breaks back below these support levels, traders should watch for a move toward the 50-day moving average at $7.00 or lower trendline support at around $6.15 per share.

The ultimate objective is delivering the end of the project the tools that will help to increase efficiency and capacity of air traffic management throughout the continent. After this successful trial, the final exercise will take place next year, clearing the way for deployment.

Europe has some of the busiest airspace in the world, covering 11.5 million km2 of airspace managed through 63 en-route centers. Today, when an aircraft crosses several borders, destination control and airports may not have access to complete and updated flight information.

Indra, Leonardo and Thales, within the framework of the 4DTM project, have developed the Interoperability (IOP) solution that will help to solve this problem, allowing all involved concerned ATC centers to know simultaneously the complete flight trajectory, thus supporting smoother coordination and transfer between Air Traffic Control centers improving European air traffic flows.

Taking place simultaneously in the Maastricht, Reims, Langen and Rome area control centers, the demonstration involved EUROCONTROL and French, German and Italian air navigation service providers (DSNA, DFS and ENAV, respectively). The solution was tested in a variety of en-route scenarios, covering different stages of the flight.

The technological solution is based on Flight Objects that allow all parties involved in the management of a flight to share, access and update information about its situation to have a consistent view of its development.

Air Traffic Controllers checked how the solution managed the Flight Objects using System-Wide Information Management (SWIM) to share updated trajectory information, and were able to coordinate the transfer of several flights across the concerned en-route ATC centers.

Results showed concept feasibility, increased situational awareness and seamless operations (for instance, change of route spanning several centers).

After further development, the consistent view of the flight will make it possible to schedule and execute flights more accurately, reducing workload and increasing efficiency.

The development of this solution follows the work conducted in the first phase of the SESAR program, which ended in 2016 with the release of SESAR Initial ground-ground Interoperability Solution . This solution was developed with the air navigation service providers in Germany (DFS), France (DSNA) and Italy (ENAV), EUROCONTROL (MUAC), Spain (ENAIRE), UK (NATS), and the air navigation service providers partnership COOPANS. The Network Manager also participated in the activity.

4DTM, Technological solutions for a single integrated view of the European flights

FO IOP is one of eight solutions currently being developed as part of the Four Dimensions Trajectory Management (4DTM) project, whose overall aim is to establish the technological building blocks for trajectory based operations.

The 4DTM consortium, led by Indra, is composed of 28 members spreading over air navigation service providers, technology firms and research bodies across the whole continent.

The project has received funding from the SESAR Joint Undertaking under European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. www.sesarju.eu

UK Royal Navy and Marines test Thales' Lightweight Multirole Missile - The Defense Post,"Tue, 16 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRlZmVuc2Vwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDE5LzA3LzE2L3VrLXJveWFsLW5hdnktbWFyaW5lcy10ZXN0LXRoYWxlcy1saWdodHdlaWdodC1tdWx0aXJvbGUtbWlzc2lsZS1tYXJ0bGV0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The United Kingdom’s Royal Navy tested Thales’ Lightweight Multirole Missile – also known as Martlet – against a speedboat target, less than a fortnight after the Royal Marines tested a shoulder-fired variant of the same missile against a drone target.

The Royal Navy test of four missiles was carried out by the Type 23 frigate HMS Sutherland in the Irish Sea off the coast of Wales, the navy said in a Tuesday, July 16 release, noting that “recent incidents where both merchant and military shipping have been attacked by manned and unmanned surface and air systems armed with explosive devices, underlined the risks faced by Royal Navy units deployed in danger zones.”

The test came just five months after the Royal Navy decided to modify the missile system to fit it to an existing 30mm automatic gun to add to ships’ defense capabilities.

Development of the Lightweight Multirole Missile began in 2008, reportedly expanding on Thales’ experience with the Starstreak missile.

Originally intended for use on the Royal Navy’s new AW139 Wildcat helicopters, the LMM has since been developed to be fired from a variety of platforms including fixed- and rotary-winged Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, ground vehicles and naval craft.

It is designed to be used against a variety of targets including static installations, vehicles, fast in-shore attack craft and drones.

Powered by a two-stage motor, the modular LMM can use different precision guidance modes including laser beam riding and laser designation, and carries a 3 kg dual-effect blast fragmentation and shaped charge warhead with a selectable impact or proximity mode fuze.

The 13 kg missile has a maximum range of 6 km and travels at approximately Mach 1.5.

The U.K. ordered 1,000 LMMs in 2011.

HMS Sutherland’s gun system was first tested for accuracy with the missile fitted, and the Martlet sensors were tested to track a radio-controlled speedboat at 5 km (3 miles) range.

The first missile tested the effects of a launch on the gun system and ship, and then three were fired to measure the missile’s accuracy against a fast inshore attack craft.

“A target boat took a direct hit in the Irish Sea as the Royal Navy successfully tested its new missile to defeat terrorists and suicide bombers,” the release said.

“The rapid integration of Lightweight Multi-Role Missile on to the 30mm gun demonstrates how Thales can quickly develop cost-effective high capability solutions to meet the evolving threats faced by our naval forces,” Malcolm McKenzie from Thales said.

Royal Marines test shoulder-fired Lightweight Multirole Missile

The successful Royal Navy test came after the Royal Marines said it tested the Lightweight Multirole Missile fired from a shoulder launcher against unmanned aerial targets.

The test announced on July 4 saw Banshee target drones launched from the shore in south Wales which were then targeted by commandos using the Lightweight Multirole Missile system.

After firing the LMM from shoulder launcher, the operator then directs a laser beam which the missile rides.

The first missile destroyed the target, and subsequent tests employed an ‘optical wedge’ which puts the operators aim off slightly so the target is intentionally missed. The miss distance is then measured by radar to determine the success of the test.

“Currently we’ve had 18 successful shots against the Banshee drone,” Captain James O’Rourke, Officer Commanding of Air Defence Troop of of 30 Commando IX Group said. “I think in the future we’ll be attached to close combat rifle companies, pushing forward and potentially targeting Unmanned Aerial Systems and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.”"

Madrid, July 26th 2019 – Thales Alenia Space in Spain has delivered the communications module for the Euclid satellite to Thales Alenia Space’s Turin plant, where it will be integrated with the service module. Euclid is a European Space Agency (ESA) astronomy and astrophysics mission designed to help us better understand the nature of dark energy and dark matter. Thales Alenia Space in Spain is responsible for the communications system, while Thales Alenia Space in Italy is the satellite prime contractor, and also responsible for the service module.

Euclid will map the general structure of the Universe over 10 billion light years to show its expansion and growth during the last three-quarters of its history. The mission is designed to address two of the most important questions in cosmology today: How did the Universe originate and why is it expanding at an accelerating rate, rather than slowing down due to the gravitational attraction of its constituent matter?

Communicating at 1.5 million kilometers

Euclid will map the 3D distribution of up to two billion galaxies and associated dark matter during a six-year mission, covering most of the sky outside our Milky Way. The complete survey represents hundreds of thousands of images and several tens of petabytes of data. This huge amount of data will be transmitted by the satellite from its orbit around the L2 Sun-Earth Lagrangian point at a distance of 1.5 million kilometers from the Earth, using its K-band radiofrequency data transmission system. Euclid also incorporates an X-band system to control and monitor the spacecraft, and measure its distance to Earth.

According to Eduardo Bellido, CEO of Thales Alenia Space in Spain, “This program confirms Thales Alenia Space in Spain’s status as the European benchmark in communications subsystems. The delivery of the communications module marks an important milestone in the program. We are very proud to be playing a key role in one of ESA’s flagship programs to help us better understand the Universe.”

Thales Alenia Space in Spain is specialized in satellite communications, building on a long heritage in TT&C and data transmission systems for all type of space missions, including missions in low Earth orbit (LEO), geostationary orbit (GEO), lunar orbit and science missions orbiting around the L2 Lagrangian point (Herschel, Planck, Euclid, WFIRST, PLATO). Over the last 15 months, the company has delivered communications systems for 12 different satellites, including Sentinel 1, 2 and 3 (‘C’ and ‘D’ families), Meteosat Third Generation (MTG), Euclid and an export program comprising 3 Earth observation satellites.

Paolo Musi, Director of Science Programs at Thales Alenia Space in Italy, added “The development of Euclid is on track, with the ongoing integration and testing of the service module flight model in Turin, while the complete satellite structural and thermal model (STM) is ready for thermal qualification tests in Cannes. The Euclid program also reflects Thales Alenia Space’s strong presence in Europe, with outstanding contributions by our teams in Italy, Spain, Belgium and France.”

The Euclid service module has already begun integration and testing in Turin. The launch is planned for 2022, using a Soyuz rocket operating at Europe's Spaceport in French Guiana.

"To improve interconnectivity between platforms, Thales launches NEXEN - EDR Magazine","Wed, 17 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVkcm1hZ2F6aW5lLmV1L3RvLWltcHJvdmUtaW50ZXJjb25uZWN0aXZpdHktYmV0d2Vlbi1wbGF0Zm9ybXMtdGhhbGVzLWxhdW5jaGVzLW5leGVu0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Wednesday, 17 July 2019 — Air combat is becoming increasingly reliant on the interconnected platforms that exchange digital data with each other. Real-time data correlation provides information superiority to the armed forces. Their missions require many means of communication to be managed without worrying about which transmission channel is to be used. Thales therefore proposes NEXEN, a secure communications server which gives pilots a reliable and simplified source of connectivity.

At the heart of aeronautical connectivity, NEXEN integrates all the functions necessary for a military aircraft to exchange data in real-time. Thanks to NEXEN, all resources can be shared; with each security level assigned its own dedicated transmission chain. With its ANSSI-certified enclosure, NEXEN guarantees not only the separation of data flows according to their level of confidentiality but also the implementation of the best cybersecurity protections. The pilot is able to manage all radios at the same time, limiting the overall workload. Mission systems are able to efficiently exchange their respective data in real-time. Therefore, this solution will allow pilots to focus better on their core mission during moments of critical decision-making.

NEXEN offers a user-oriented architecture: all participants can publish their own resources and subscribe to other user channels without worrying about their location or the necessary means of transmission. This solution provides military aircrafts with the scalability that will enable them to meet the connectivity challenges of the coming decades. Thus, pilots will always have access to the most essential information for all tactical situations.

The target platforms for this solution are combat aircrafts, mission aircrafts, helicopters and drones.

Thales's Lightweight Multirole Missile bang on target again - Thales,"Thu, 18 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi91bml0ZWQta2luZ2RvbS9uZXdzL3RoYWxlc3MtbGlnaHR3ZWlnaHQtbXVsdGlyb2xlLW1pc3NpbGUtYmFuZy10YXJnZXQtYWdhaW7SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"LMM firing from the Type 23 frigate, HMS Sutherland

Recent incidents where both merchant and military shipping have been attacked by manned and unmanned surface and air systems armed with explosive devices, underlines the risks faced by Royal Navy units deployed.

Following on from tests of the Lightweight Multirole Missile (LMM) from a moving platform the UK MoD requested Thales demonstrate the capability of LMM fired from a ship against these threats at sea.

Thales working with MSI Defence, demonstrated the precision strike of the Lightweight Multirole Missile from the Type 23 frigate, HMS Sutherland. Working closely with ship staff and DE&S, the Thales/MSI team successfully engaged small unmanned surface targets closing the ship rapidly and manoeuvring.

After first proving that the gun could still fire accurately with the missile fitted – 120 rounds obliterated a large red ‘killer tomato’ target – and that the sensors behind LMM could track its radio-controlled foe at ranges of up to five kilometres.

Finally, four missiles were fired – one to test the effect of LMM ‘blasting off’ from its launcher on the gun mounting and the side of Sutherland (the missile accelerates to one and a half times the speed of sound in an instant), three packed with telemetry to measure the missile’s accuracy (ordinarily the weapon carries a 3kg warhead).

All was recorded by high resolution cameras so the team from manufacturers Thales and military scientists could analyse the effects in minute detail.

HMS Surtherland’s Commanding Officer, Tom Weaver said:

The impressive result of this trial was achieved through the hard work and cooperation of a wide array of industry and defence partners and it was rewarding for Sutherland to have played such a key role in its success

The rapid integration of LMM onto the MSI 30mm gun demonstrates how Thales can quickly develop cost-effective high capability solutions to meet the evolving threats faced by our naval forces. The success of the trial was a true team effort and delivery was only possible due to the outstanding contributions of HMS SUTHERLAND’s crew.

Small naval threats are very problematic due to their high mobility, small signature and sever background clutter. LMMs stabilising system, guidance and precision strike capability, make it ideal for a ‘cluttered’ naval environment. It ensures accurate target tracking and allows operators to guide the missile onto its target regardless of sea spray or platform motion.

On track for delivery in 2020 to arm the Wildcat helicopter, LMM offers the Royal Navy, through re-use of current investment, an affordable solution to counter the range of threats faced by maritime units operating in potentially high-threat environments.

Prior to LMM entering service with the Royal Navy, LMM will enter service with the Royal Marines and Royal Artillery Air Defence units in 2019. LMM will provide these units with complementary capability to the in-service STARStreak HVM system.

Maritime contributes £37.4bn to the UK GDP and 95% of the country’s trade is seaborne. Furthermore, with the UK’s upcoming exit from the European Union, the Government has signaled its intention to be even more ambitious in developing the maritime industry, as it aims to reshape its relationship with the world. Its long-term blueprint for the sector, Maritime 2050, outlines ambitious plans to become a world maritime leader.



However, public perceptions of the maritime industry are lagging behind the reality, according to new research from Thales, which has found that only one in three people (30%) believe that the ocean is very important to the economy.



Perceptions of ingenuity and innovation in maritime also reflect a general lack of awareness, according to the study. Just 17% of respondents predict we will see unmanned non-military vehicles in the ocean, significantly fewer than think we’ll see them on the road or in the air (27% and 26% respectively). When in fact, various trials of autonomous vehicles are already underway in the maritime sector, including at the Maritime Autonomy Centre at Turnchapel Wharf, Plymouth, with a five year commitment to developing autonomous systems. This is one of a large number of projects Thales is involved in to develop the sector.



The Maritime Autonomy Centre at Turnchapel Wharf

The oceans’ contribution to life in the UK goes further than trade and security, ranging from supplying our energy needs and providing valuable natural resources, to protecting our fragile climate and environment. As such, maritime is on the rise, with predictions that the global ocean economy will double to £3tn by 2030.



The Government has rightly set out an ambitious Maritime 2050 vision, requiring the engagement of industry, academia, small business and the general public. Yet, as our findings show, there is a need to significantly raise public awareness of, and engagement in, the importance of the maritime sector. Thales is proud to lead the charge in bringing together key stakeholders in the industry to explore the potential and opportunities that exist as well as come together to highlight the success in the sector.

The Member for Bathurst, the Hon Paul Toole MP today unveiled a new $1.8 million honing machine on the rifle production line at Lithgow Arms.

The new equipment brings Thales’s investment to more than $30 million in plant and equipment at Lithgow Arms since 2006.

This investment demonstrates Thales’s continuing investment in maintaining Australia’s sovereign industrial capability in small arms research, design, development and manufacture.

Thales’s continued investment over more than a decade has unlocked the potential of the site, winning contracts and generating jobs and investment in Lithgow, the Central West and along the supply chain.

In order to maintain a capability advantage for Australia’s Defence Forces, Thales is investing in world class manufacturing capabilities that can be integrated with digital technologies, including 3D printing, advanced optical and targeting equipment and secure digitally networked systems.

Member for Bathurst, Paul Toole said that 92% of content used in production is sourced locally or made on site.

“I am delighted that more than 200 of Lithgow Arms’s suppliers are located in NSW, and over the last three years these suppliers have received almost $20 million in orders from Thales” Mr Toole said.

“Since 1912, the Lithgow Small Arms Factory (now known as Lithgow Arms) has proudly supported Australia’s soldiers on battlefields around the world,” he said.

Director of Soldier Weapons Systems, Graham Evenden, said that Thales is investing significantly in its manufacturing capability and skills development to develop the world leading technologies for future products.

“Today’s unveiling shows our intent to build on Lithgow Arms’ distinguished heritage to develop and manufacture the next generation soldier weapons systems for the future Australian Defence Force.”

400K NYC MTA Daily Riders Rely on Thales Driverless Trains (Multi-Video) - 107.180.56.147,"Mon, 29 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vYW1lcmljYW5zZWN1cml0eXRvZGF5LmNvbS80MDBrLW55Yy1tdGEtZGFpbHktcmlkZXJzLXJlbHktb24tdGhhbGVzLWRyaXZlcmxlc3MtdHJhaW5zLW11bHRpLXZpZGVvL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In May of 2019, the Flushing Line for MTA New York City Transit (NYCT), enabled Thales Automatic Train Operation (ATO) capabilities .

The Flushing Line, one of the busiest subway lines in New York City, has now been running exclusively on the Thales SelTracTM Communications Based Train Control (CBTC) signaling system for over five months and service has steadily improved month-over-month since implementation.

(The goal of every metro operator is transporting as many passengers as possible safely and efficiently at the lowest operating cost. The best way to achieve that goal is a Fully Automated Operation (FAO), or driverless system, enabled by high performing CBTC. And the proof is in excellent safety record and low operating costs Thales has achieved for over three decades. Courtesy of Thales and YouTube. Posted on Nov 8, 2018.)

In December 2018 full revenue service began, with the Certificate of Substantial Completion finalized for the line in March 2019.

On-time performance since revenue service began has increased by over 16 percentage points to 91 percent, up from 74.7 percent which was the on-time performance the month before the CBTC system was fully deployed.

For riders, the average amount of time they now spend onboard a train beyond their scheduled travel time has decreased from 1 minute, 40 seconds to an average of just 39 seconds.

For onboard train operators, ATO implementation means they can put more focus on platform procedures and emergency braking while the train runs automatically.

“By resignaling one of the busiest lines in New York, Thales has once again proven its outstanding capabilities in urban rail modernization,” explained Dominique Gaiardo, Vice President and Managing Director for Thales’ urban rail signaling business.

“We are committed to supporting the future of New York City with its Fast Forward plan and contribute to increased public transit capacity for New Yorkers.”

This transportation infrastructure project was the first irreversible resignaling cutover project in North America and modernized the line’s 10.5 miles of track.

The results are greater flexibility of operations across the 46 existing trains that service 22 stations, with the number of trains on the Flushing Line during peak hours now able to service an additional 2,400 to 4,800 passengers per hour.

(What is it? How does it work? Understand the basics of Communications-Based Train Control with Thales. Courtesy of Thales and YouTube. Posted on Sep 11, 2015.)

Thales’ ability to create world class passenger journeys has come from the experience of creating or modernizing other major transit systems, including San Francisco, London, Vancouver, Dubai, Paris, Singapore, and Seoul.

Today, the 400,000 daily riders on the Flushing Line can enjoy the benefits of the Thales SelTrac™ CBTC system which provides the highest levels of performance and complies with the world’s most stringent standards for maximum safety and efficiency.

In constrained environments, where operations run 24 hours a day, seven days a week, the riders on the Flushing Line can now rely on Thales – whatever it takes."

Mounted on armored vehicles of more than 15 tons, the 120 mm 2R2M mortar, which will take the French designation of “MEPAC - mortier embarqué pour l'appui au contact, or embedded mortar for the contact support), can be ready for fire in just seconds with two men (pointer/shooter and ammunition supplier). Thanks to its semi-automatic loading system, the mortar can fire ten rounds in one minute, with greater precision compared to the towed version thanks to the recoil brake. It can then quickly get back to the road configuration and simultaneously restart and close its hatches to avoid counter-battery fire.

Thales already exported this system on VAB 6x6 chassis to Saudi Arabia, Italy, Malaysia and the Sultanate of Oman, which have opted for this mortar to equip their elite troops. Thales Defense has already expressions of interest from Europe, the Middle East and Asia. The manufacturer delivered the 100th 2R2M at the beginning of 2019.

Thales president pushes for FCAS and Tempest rapprochement - Meta-Defense,"Sat, 20 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vbWV0YS1kZWZlbnNlLmZyL2VuLzIwMTkvMDcvMjAvdGhlLXByZXNpZGVudC1vZi10aGFsZXMtY2FtcGFpZ25zLWZvci1hLXJhcHByb2NoZW1lbnQtYmV0d2Vlbi10aGUtc2NhZi1hbmQtdGhlLXRlbXBlc3Qv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In an interview given to “ The New Factory”, Patrick Caine, the president of the French electronics group Thales, judges that the Franco-German FCAS programs and the British Tempest program would benefit from a rapprochement, to avoid recreating a situation comparable to that which gave rise to the Rafale and Typhoon 30 years ago.

This interview, which sounds like a call for reason to the attention of European leaders, follows the announcement of the partnership between Thales and the British Aeralis for the development of the training and simulation system attached to the British Tempest program. Above all, Thales, whose DNA tends more towards Great Britain than towards Germany, often appears as the big French loser in the FCAS program, on the altar of industrial sharing for the benefit of Airbus DS.

However, the call for the rationalization of European programs, if it could possibly favor Thales in certain areas, would risk creating even more of a problem of exclusion than the FCAS. Indeed, where the Franco-German (and Spanish) program ensures the sustainability of the know-how of Dassault aviation and Safran, a program integrating Great Britain and Sweden would require a sharing difficult for Dassault to accept in the field. of aircraft design with BAe and Saab, also very efficient in this area, and Safran in the field of engines with Rolls-Royce, its long-time competitor.

Side by side, the model of the Tempest the F-35 Lightning II and a Typhoon

Indeed, at constant scope, the rapprochement of European programs would, on the contrary, risk weakening the BITDs of each participating country, by requiring too much cooperation. As FCAS/Tempest is the only program planned for several decades in Europe, it will be impossible for these companies to maintain hard-earned know-how if it is not selected to lead this area in the program.

In fact, and as has already been mentioned, the one and only means which would allow European rapprochement around a combat aircraft program, would be to move to a higher level of development and planning: Program schedule. European countries would commit, in this model, to developing not one combat system, but several systems creating a range of systems meeting all European needs, with planning more adapted to geostrategic reality, increasing opportunities commercial activities while respecting a financial framework not exceeding that of two competing European programs.

More simply, it would be a question of developing a range of aircraft, a light single-engine in the Mirage2000/F16/Gripen segment, a versatile twin-engine in the range Rafale/F18/Typhoon, and a heavy device, potentially hypersonic, in the F22/Su57/J20 niche, in an approach of technological progressiveness allowing a tiling of developments. To be effective, it would be relevant to integrate drones and other remote effectors into this program program, with more global approaches and dedicated schedules.

Model of the 5th generation replacement for the Chinese JH-7. Several observations seem to attest that the device is already in the flight testing phase.

This approach would make it possible to develop a real range of devices making it possible to move away from the doctrine of the “super-versatile” device, and would create a technological rotation comparable to those planned by the technological superpowers, the United States (which is working already replacing the F22 and the Super Hornet), and China, which should very soon present its 3rd 5th generation aircraft, intended to replace the JH-7 attack aircraft. By multiplying the programs in a global program, in a global long-term vision at European level, it will also be possible to promote European industrial consolidation in a reasoned and beneficial approach both for employment and for the efficiency of Defense investment. .

If Thales actually wants to encourage political decision-makers to have a more effective and European vision of the FCAS and Tempest programs, it would be preferable to propose a well-argued model based on this approach, especially since, as said previously, the development of a range of devices and drones in a single European program would not exceed, from the point of view of public finances, the sum of the envelopes devoted to the FCAS and the Tempest.

There is no doubt that Thales would be best placed to support and carry out such a project!"

Japan’s Ministry of Defence (MOD) claims that its aircraft was illuminated on several occasions by a Thales STIR-180 X-band (8.5 gigahertz/GHz to 10.68GHz) / K-band (24.05GHz to 24.25GHz) fire control radar onboard the ROKN warship. Japan’s government has claimed that the ROKN’s actions violated the Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES), something which is disputed by Seoul. The CUES comprises 21 signatories and aims to reduce the chances of hostile incidents occurring between the signatories, and to prevent them escalating if they do, although the agreement is not legally binding. Seoul has disputed Tokyo’s claims by arguing that the P-1 was repeatedly over-flying the ship at a low altitude of 500 feet (150 metres) while the destroyer assisted the rescue of a Democratic People’s Republic of Korea fishing boat experiencing difficulties. Citing the CUES, Seoul claimed that the P-1’s actions violated this agreement. Seoul has also denied that the warship employed the STIR-180, instead claiming that the ship’s Thales MW-08 C-band (5.25GHz to 5.925GHz) naval surveillance radar was being used to assist the rescue.

Radar Lock

The electromagnetic aspects of the encounter stoked the fires on 22 December. The Japanese MOD claimed its own analysis had confirmed that the Radio Frequency (RF) transmissions were from the STIR-180, presumably detected by the P-1’s Mitsubishi HLR-109B ESM (Electronic Support Measure).

Little public information exists regarding the HLR-109B, although some confidential EW practitioners informed the author that the ESM is one of the most advanced such systems flying today. It almost certainly covers a waveband of 500 megahertz/MHz to 18GHz, and possibly up to 40GHz. This would allow it to gather Electronic Intelligence (ELINT) on a wide array of ground-based air surveillance, fire control/ground controlled interception, naval surveillance and airborne radars, and Active Radar Homing (ARH) seekers equipping missiles.

The HLR-109B is reported to be a highly sensitive system capable of long detection ranges. It is reasonable to assume that the HLR-109B is capable of discriminating between the MW-08 and the STIR-180: Both use different RF wavebands, and the waveforms used by their radars will be significantly different; not least because the STIR-180’s function is to guide kinetic ordnance to its target, while the MW-08 performs general surface and air surveillance.

For the time being both side are maintaining their respective positions. That said the incident underlines the importance of electromagnetic situational awareness in the naval domain. So-called ‘radar lock’ incidents, where one party has illuminated the platform of another with a radar in an action perceived as threatening or belligerent, have occurred on several occasions in the Asia-Pacific in recent years. The danger of such incidents, as this latest occurrence underscores, is that intentions can be misinterpreted and tensions raised through such behaviour.

Whatever the reality of the incident involving Japan and the ROK, it was important that cool heads have prevailed and fire was not exchanged. Nevertheless in tense areas such as the East and South China Seas, where the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and several other nations maintain competing maritime and territorial claims, the concern must be that a similar incident in the future may trigger a skirmish which could quickly boil over into a regional conflict.

For example, in early 2013 People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) officials admitted that the radar on one of its frigates locked onto a JMSDF destroyer when the two ships were around 70 nautical miles/nm (130 kilometres/km) north of the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea.

Situational Awareness

Knowing exactly what is happening in the ether, (i.e. whether a vessel is being illuminated by a radar and, if so, what radar is involved) improves situational awareness immeasurably. On a warship the process of identifying whether the vessel has been detected by radar, the type of radar involved and determining its location is comprehended using an ESM.

In the maritime domain the key mission of an ESM is to intercept and analyse RF emissions from naval surveillance, navigation, fire control, air traffic control, airborne and missile seeker radars. At the core of an ESM is a computer which performs the signals processing using a pre-loaded ‘library’ of signal characteristics which have been collected by the navy, or by a particular countries’ armed forces writ large, over a number of years. The computer will attempt to match the characteristics of the detected signal with those loaded in its library to identify the type of radar and the waveforms it maybe transmitting.

The average ESM library can contain several thousand records and can be continually updated with new records as and when new radar systems, or waveforms, are discovered. Similarly, unidentified transmission can be stored in the library for later analysis. Put simply, ELINT processing comprises three steps: the collection of radar pulses from the electromagnetic environment, the sorting of these pulses into specific ‘pulse trains’ i.e. the association of one set of pulses with a particular radar type and finally using this process to identify the radar.

Analogous to the ESM’s identification techniques is its ability to determine a radar’s line of bearing from the ship, although this will not necessarily provide range. This can usually only be determined with a minimum of two separate ESMs which can all see the same target and thus triangulate its position. This is nonetheless challenging as radars transmit across a line-of-sight range and will need to be pointing at the ESMs for this triangulation to be performed.

In naval EW, the ESM will tend to provide details on the radar type and bearing, while it will be for a warship’s other sensors, such as its main surveillance radar to determine the target’s location. Nevertheless, the ESM forms a vital part of a ship’s self-defence, not to mention a task force’s overall situational awareness at the operational level by determining a radar’s type and bearing. Determining such factors can inform the crew of the action that they will need to take to either avoid a radar threat, jam it using electronic attack, or attack the platform carrying the radar with kinetic means.

At the operational level the ELINT gathered by the ESM can be shared to improve the overall situational awareness vis-à-vis the electronic order-of-battle and possible enemy intentions. Naval ESMs tend to cover a waveband of 0.5MHz to 18GHz allowing them to detect emissions from the radars described above. Some will extend up to 40GHz. This will enable them to detect higher-band radar emissions; those typically associated with so-called Millimetre Wave (MMW) radar. MMW radars typically transmit at frequencies upwards of 30GHz.

Missile Mayhem

Such radars are attractive to Anti-Ship Missile (AShM) designers as they use very shortwave wavelengths which can show targets in a high level of detail. This is important in the naval domain as it allows an AShM equipped with such technology to ‘see’ its target clearly, and thus discount other vessels in the target’s locale. This sharp definition also helps the radar to discriminate physical countermeasures such as chaff and corner reflectors from the target, thus making the weapon potentially difficult to spoof. Finally, MMW radars use comparatively small-sized antennae, thus deepening their attraction to AShM designers tasked with fitting radar seekers into space-constrained platforms.

AShMs are arguably the major threat motivating naval ESM acquisitions in the Asia-Pacific, more specifically, AShMs developed by PRC which have proliferated throughout the region and beyond. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute has noted that, over the past decade, the PRC has exported almost 690 AShMs of various marques to countries around the region including Bangladesh, Burma, Indonesia, Pakistan and Thailand. These weapons have included China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation C-802, Chinese Aerospace Group C-704/705, HY-2 and CM-400AKG missiles. Details are scant regarding the exact specification of the ARHs used by these weapons, although open sources strongly suspect that they transmit in X-band (8.5GHz to 10.68GHz).

Several of these are ‘legacy’ weapons. The C-802 design, for instance, has been in service since earlier this century, while the HY-2 can trace its lineage back to the Raduga P-15 Termit AShM family which first entered service with the Soviet Navy in circa 1960.

That should not lure naval EW practitioners into a false sense of security. Speaking to the author during the Association of Old Crows’ (AOC) EW Asia conference held in Singapore between 29-30 January, several sources spoke candidly regarding the threat that such weapons pose: “China’s missiles are scaring…everyone in the region,” one senior EW industry executive confided.

The fear factor in this regard, another stated, is because the weapons’ ARH technology is thought to have been continually upgraded and enhanced throughout their service lives, and further improvements are strongly expected. If anyone needed any illustration of the potency of the PRC’s AShMs, one need look no further that the attack against the Israeli Navy’s INS Hanit ‘Sa’ar-5’ class corvette on 14 July 2006. That day, the ship was struck by a C-802 launched by the Hezbollah Shia Islamist organisation from the coast of Lebanon from a reported range of 10nm (18.5km) which caused the deaths of four crew. Worryingly then, as now, the Israeli Navy represented one of the most technologically advanced maritime forces in the world, yet the insurgents were still able to score a spectacular propaganda victory against their adversary. Such incidents underscore the importance of ensuring that surface vessels are outfitted with up-to-date ESMs to detect such threats.

“They (the PRC) continually improve their anti-ship missiles,” another senior industry executive and former naval EW officer, told the author during the AOC event. Such modernisations may have included the retrofit of low power ARHs into these weapons. This will have the asset of effectively ‘hiding’ the missile’s radar transmissions within the prevailing natural and man-made ‘noise’ in the electromagnetic spectrum, meaning that the sensitivity of naval ESMs have to be especially sharp to detect such discreet signals.

Alongside such Low Probability of Interception/Detection (LPI/LPD) techniques these weapons’ ARHs may have received complex transmission waveforms designed to mask their transmissions, and electronic counter-countermeasure enhancements to enable the seeker to detect and discount jamming attempts using either physical soft-kill countermeasures such as corner reflectors or chaff. Frequency agility is another LPI/LPD technique which can help to both mask the radar’s transmissions and to outflank electronic attack by jamming.

The remedy to such challenges is the continued investment in state-of-the-art ESM technologies, particularly in detection and signal processing software to ensure that new ARH radar transmission techniques can be effectively detected and countered as and when they appear.

Conclusions

To say that naval ESMs aid situational awareness in the maritime domain would be an understatement. They are quite simply indispensable to understanding what is happening in the electromagnetic spectrum at the tactical level as well as contributing to the operational level electronic order-of-battle. Knowing what is emitting, and why, enables timely decisions to be made on when and how to deploy soft- and hard-kill capabilities against air or surface threats. The proliferation of AShMs shows no signs of abating in the Asia-Pacific, or elsewhere for that matter. Naval ESMs can at the very least help navies to understand what is out there, and how they may need to respond.

CBTC contractors at fault for Hong Kong collision - MTR panel - International Railway Journal,"Mon, 08 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWxqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9zaWduYWxsaW5nL2NvbnRyYWN0b3JzLXJlc3BvbnNpYmxlLWhrLWNvbGxpc2lvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The collision occurred during a test on TWL when one train entered Central Station via a crossover and collided with another train that was departing the station using the same crossover. MTR suspended all further CBTC testing until May 29 following the incident.

Thales and Alstom are installing Thales’ Seltrac CBTC system across seven metro lines in Hong Kong under a €330m contract awarded in 2015. The suppliers are replacing existing Automatic Train Supervision (ATS), interlocking and Automatic Train Control technology in the control centre, onboard trains and at stations.

The contractor have been conducting tests on the line since December 2016, which have been progressively expanded from a single train to multiple trains, and to cover all aspects of the control system.

The signalling system is divided into two control zones with each zone comprising three signalling zone controller computers: Primary (A); Hot stand-by (B); and Warm stand-by (C), an arrangement the panel notes as novel in the contractor’s signalling system application for reducing recovery time during signalling failure incidents. The drill on March 18 was for operations staff to familiarise themselves with the operational procedures when computers A and B fail and the switch to computer C to control the signalling system takes place.

While the contractor needs to make software changes for the new signalling system during the development process, the panel found that the contractor made three software implementation errors when performing a software change in 2017 to achieve the design intention of avoiding common mode failure in Computer C, should there be a problem in Computers A and B. Critically, conflict zone protection information was not properly configured in Computer C, which ultimately led to the collision.

Conclusions

The investigation panel was co-chaired by Mr Adi Lau, MTR operations director, and Dr Peter Ewen, MTR engineering director, and concluded that the errors reflect the contractor’s inadequacies in upholding software quality assurance, risk assessment, and the extent of simulation on this software change.

Following the incident, the contractor has replaced the software design and development team responsible for the software implementation errors. The panel also recommends the contractor adopt the following improvement measures:

fix the software issue and confirm with substantiation that there are no wider implications in software development quality

enhance the software coding and testing practices to avoid future programming errors, and introduce effective and traceable measures for detection of any programming errors

employ an external independent software assessor to enhance the software development process for the signalling zone controller computers, and

review, re-check and demonstrate robustness on its approach with traceable evidence in applying a fail-safe principle.

In addition, the panel says MTR should assist the contractor with the above improvements by adopting the following measures:

expand the scope of the ISA from safety assurance for passenger service to the inclusion of on-site train related testing certification

upgrade the training simulator in Hong Kong to act as a testing simulation tool to perform more scenario simulation tests as far as practicable

establish a joint Safety Test & Commissioning Panel (the Corporation/contractor together with input from the ISA) to manage on-site testing, and

explore together with the panel’s experts the merits, if any, for staging the development of the Warm-standby computer, or any other technically appropriate alternatives proposed by the contractor.

“For a corporation that always puts safety as our top priority, we take every incident which has an impact on the safety of people inside MTR premises very seriously and would spare no effort in identifying the cause and looking at ways to prevent any recurrence. The 18 March incident is no exception,” says Dr Jacob Kam, MTR CEO. “We will make sure all necessary improvements are made by vigilantly monitoring the contractor to implement necessary follow up work and enhancing our own monitoring system.”

Response

The error is within Thales' scope of the contract, and responding to the panel’s findings, Thales said in a statement that it fully collaborated with the government and MTR’s investigation panel. The company added that it is committed to working with MTR and the relevant stakeholders to implement all the recommendations in the MTR investigation panel report.

“Thales has over 30 years’ experience in safely transporting more than 3 billion passengers per year and the Thales CBTC system is the world’s most widely adopted and trusted CBTC system,” the company says. “We are confident that the CBTC system is a secure and reliable system for Hong Kong DUAT lines operation. We are fully committed to delivering the solution in a safe manner.”"

LinkedIn

Thales’s services to the Royal Air Force, delivered by the ACE Training and Simulation team, have been recognised in the 2019 Queen’s Birthday Honours list. The commendation was awarded in ‘recognition of exceptional qualities and personal sacrifices in the service of others,’ after forty years of providing training for Tornado fast jet pilots and crew.

“I’m delighted that our hard-working ACE team has received this recognition,” said Thales’s Head of Military Training in the UK David Bolsover, a veteran RAF pilot. “The team has worked really hard to give the RAF some of the best aviators in the world – people who we all depend upon to protect our national interests and international obligations.”

The RAF has used the training and simulation services provided by Thales for the Tornado multi-role combat aircraft from the day it entered service until the day it was finally retired.

Over its four decades of operational service, in which nearly 1,000 aircraft were built (the last one left the factory in 1998), the Tornado has seen action in the Gulf War of 1991, and in Libya, Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria.

The ACE team has provided and managed the buildings, infrastructure, engineers, instructors, administration staff, classroom facilities, desktop training systems and three full flight simulators at RAF bases in Lossiemouth and Marham, clocking up more than 57,000 simulator flying hours in 38,000 simulator sorties.

Other Thales personnel have played a crucial role, too, not least by sacrificing their evenings and weekends to install a total of 75 upgrades to the simulators (in advance of upgrades being installed in the real aircraft) to avoid any interruptions to training. And that’s not all.

Thales has also provided training on the A400M transport aircraft, the Voyager air-to-air refuelling tanker and the VC10, Tristar, C130, Harrier and Jaguar aircraft, and the Eurofighter Typhoon, and has notched up more than 42,000 hours of simulation for potential fast jet pilots, on the Tucano trainer.

Why old technology can’t keep up

Every fighter pilot has to be trained to deal with extreme G-forces. 9G, which the early 1950s centrifuges used by trainee pilots can achieve, is enough to force blood away from the brain and into the legs, creating tunnel vision and blackouts. This allows the trainee to experience the use of a G-suit and to practise anti-G Straining manoeuvres to diminish the blood-pooling effects of G. But the old-style centrifuges take a leisurely 9 seconds to spin fast enough to deliver 9G. That’s a problem.

In combat, today’s fast jets can subject a pilot to high-G in an instant, and it is essential that the pilot is ready to deal with this. Thales is meeting this need with an all-new High-G Training and Testing facility, which was recently opened as part of a £44 million project at RAF Cranwell in Lincolnshire. Its centrifuge can accelerate the occupant from 1.6G to 9G in just one second.

Unlike the early centrifuges, in which the trainee was simply strapped in for a ‘ride’, the facility at Cranwell also features a flight simulator, with highly realistic out-of-the-window views, accurate displays and working flight controls which the pilot can operate to ‘fly’ the machine. This lets the pilot experience (and practise mitigating) the extreme physiological effects of performing sudden high-speed manoeuvres, such as the tight turns which are used in dogfights and missile evasion, in complete safety.

The Cranwell high-G simulator is the only facility of its kind in the UK and one of only three in the whole world.

The simulator can also perform a rapid transition from positive to negative G (down to -3) to replicate one of the most common causes of something called G-LOC (G-induced Loss Of Consciousness), a dangerous condition in which the pilot blacks out. Forces as high as 12G can be also be created, in order to test equipment.

A life-like experience

The ‘brain’ of the simulator is software from industry-leading developer AMST. As well as giving the pilot the ability to create and experience high-G manoeuvres, it is linked to an instructor’s station. This allows the pilot to fly against a virtual opponent in a dogfight, with the enemy aircraft being ‘flown’ by the instructor.

David Bolsover is convinced of the value of advanced high-G training and simulation. “The pilots think its brilliant,” he said.

“You sit in a real cockpit, with real controls, experiencing the G-force created by your own control inputs. What’s more, we can now generate the G-profiles that the doctors have been asking for. This is as real as it gets without actually being in the air.”

The simulator can be equipped and configured to replicate the Hawk T2, the Eurofighter Typhoon and the RAF’s most recent fighter, the F35 Lightning. Changing configurations takes just 30 minutes.

A force for the common good

Thales will continue to develop and enhance its decades-old relationship with the RAF, improving the skills of some of the world’s best pilots for the foreseeable future. But there is an attractive export opportunity, too. The Hawk T2 trainer is in service in 18 countries around the world, the Eurofighter is in seven (soon to be nine) and the USA has sold the F35 to eleven allied air forces. That’s a lot of aircraft in a lot of countries.

High-G training is essential for the modern international air forces on who we all depend to defend our mutual interests. In Cranwell, Thales has created a solution which the UK and our allies can rely on for the best high-G simulation, training and testing capability in the world. Together, we are stronger."

Thales buys insolvent Hawkei engine manufacturer - Australian Defence Magazine,"Fri, 26 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5kZWZlbmNlLmNvbS5hdS9idXNpbmVzcy90aGFsZXMtYnV5cy1pbnNvbHZlbnQtaGF3a2VpLWVuZ2luZS1tYW51ZmFjdHVyZXLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Updated 26 July, 10:27

Thales has bought bankrupt Hawkei engine manufacturer Steyr Motors, it has emerged.

The Austrian company went into receivership in February, threatening the supply of engines to the Hawkei progam and the jobs of 150 Thales workers in Bendigo.

The news saw some vehicles slated for Initial Operational Capability delayed, although Final Operational Capability is set to occur as scheduled. Army has procured engines for the vehicles scheduled under low rate initial production and has an order for the subsequent 1,000 engines.

It was one of my [most] costly procedures so far

According to Austrian news outlets, four bidders, some under tender groups, were in the race to buy Steyr, with Thales only entering the bidding process two weeks ago. Negotiations reportedly concluded late Wednesday night local time. The purchase price is unclear.

""It was one of my [most] costly procedures so far, since there were economic, technical and legal problems,"" liquidator Norbert Mooseder said.

“Thales is fully committed to delivering the world-class Hawkei to the ADF,"" a Thales spokesperson said to ADM.

“After a deep-dive analysis of the Steyr Motors situation, Thales has committed to support the company to ensure long term sustainability and assure engine supply.

“Thales has been working closely with Steyr Motors for several years and we know the quality of its products so this decision has been made with an excellent understanding of the context.

“Thales will continue to work closely with the Commonwealth to deliver Hawkei to the ADF.”

“Thales have kept us closely in the loop. They’ve leant forward very heavily to support Steyr Motors,” MAJGEN Bottrell told ADM earlier this year. “The advice we’ve had back through the administrator is that had Thales not done that, then Steyr Motors may not have continued to operate.""

Thales is contracted to deliver 138 Hawkei vehicles for IOC. All are set to be delivered towards the end of the year."

CAIRO - 23 July 2019: The French Development Agency (FDA) is ready to fund the tramway project in Alexandria's Raml neighborhood with €100 million, French Ambassador to Cairo Stéphane Romatet said, revealing that the CEO of Vinci SA will visit Egypt soon.The ambassador praised the Ministry of Transportation’s eagerness to deliver the payments of French companies working in Egyptian projects. The statements came in a meeting with officials from the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Investment and International Cooperation on Monday.The Egyptian side pledged to eliminate obstacles that may face French companies while executing projects in Egypt, particularly in the sector of metro lines construction. In light of the successful cooperation in that sector, the Ministry of Transportation representatives said they look forward to further French investments in railway and metro projects.French companies are currently constructing - within a consortium - Greater Cairo’s fourth phase of the third metro line, the parallel line between old and new marg stations, and the Cotesca workshop at the first line.The Egyptian Railway Authority (ERA) and the French National Railway Company are cooperating on a safety system in the rail line stretching from Giza to Beni Suef. There is also cooperation with Alstom to introduce electric signals in the Beni Suef - Asyut line, while Thales Group is accomplishing the electric signal in the lines of Cairo-Alexandria, and Asyut-Sohag-Nagaa Hamady. The progress in all those projects follows the set timeline.A contract with a French consulting firm will be finalized soon to carry out studies pertinent to a prospective project to develop Abou Kir metro line in Alexandria.Officials highlighted the eagerness of the Ministry of Investment and International Cooperation to attract more investments in the transportation sector, and secure the necessary grants for its projects.On his side, the ambassador expressed France’s eagerness to help Egypt succeed in transportation projects.In 2015, the National Authority for Tunnels signed a contract with Vinci SA, Bouygues Travaux Publics S.A.S., Orascom, and Arabco to construct the fourth phase of Greater Cairo’s third metro line, as reported by Ahram Online.That phase consists of five stations and extends over 5 kilometers between Heliopolis' Haroun station and Al-Nozha 1. Alstom is in charge of accomplishing the signaling system while Colas, Thales, and Orascom are assigned the electromechanical work. Orascom along with Oravia are executing the railway tracks.In December 2017, Egypt and France signed a €344 million agreement to finance the purchase of 64 trains for the third and fourth metro lines. France is providing Egypt with a €172 million concessional loan that will be paid back over 53 years with a grace period of 20 years and an annual interest rate of 0.1 percent. The second half of the loan will be in the form of credit facilities by French credit company Coface.France had financed the construction of Greater Cairo’s three metro line completed between 1979 and 2012, with loans amounting to around €1.2 billion."

Danhai light rail transit project (LRT) is a light rail line in the Danshui district of New Taipei City. It connects Hongshulin MRT Station to Danhai New Town.

Construction on phase one of the line began in 2014, while the line began its services in December 2018.

The light rail is developed by China Steel Corporation, along with its subsidiaries United Steel Engineering & Construction Corporation and Taiwan Rolling Stock Company.

A comprehensive planning report for the project was approved in February 2013 by the central government.

The multi-phased project was built at a cost of TWD31.357bn ($998.39m), whereas the first phase involved an investment of TWD9.699bn ($308.81m).

The line served approximately 1.85 million passengers to date.

Danhai LRT project purpose

The Danhai light rail transit project establishes a robust public transport system to deal with the growing population of Danhai, a popular township that has been created recently. Danhai’s population is expected to grow to 340,000 by 2041.

The phase one line handles 80,000 passenger rides a day, while an additional 50,000 new residents are expected to move to Danhai New Township.

Danhai LRT details

The light rail encompasses two transit lines, namely the Green Mountain line and the Blue Seaside line, along with one depot. It comprises both elevated and surface tracks.

A total of 13.99km of tracks have been laid as part of the project, and 20 stations were constructed along the two transit lines. The project also includes the construction of rails, bridges, depot facilities, media and energy provisions.

The first phase of the LRT covers a distance of 9.7km, including a 5.2km at-grade section and a 4.5km elevated section. The initial phase included the construction of 11 stations along the Green Mountain route and three stations on the Blue Sea route, as well as the depot.

The second phase of the Danhai light rail transit project will cover the construction of the remaining stations of the Blue Seaside line and will be completed in 2025.

Planned route and stations

The Green Mountain line has a total of 11 stations, while the Blue Seaside route includes nine stations. The Green Mountain line stretches for approximately 8km and links the centre of the New Taipei City with Danhai, while the Blue Seaside will connect the coast to the city centre.

The Green Mountain Line starts from the Hongshulin MRT station and runs along Shuiyuan Street, Beixin Road, Binhai Road and Shalun Road before ending near the Danhai New Town project.

The Blue Seaside line will have three stops and terminate at Fishermen Wharf Station.

Rolling stock for the Danhai light rail transit

The first phase is operated with 15 34.5m-long, bi-directional trams with a low-floor design and five separate sections. Designed to be standard gauge, the trams run for longer distances and across track sections without overhead wires. They are also designed to store additional energy.

A prototype was delivered by the end of 2016, with the first tram began operating on Green Mountain line in 2018.

Thales increasing local footprint with Transport Competence Centre - Rail Express,"Tue, 09 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWxleHByZXNzLmNvbS5hdS90aGFsZXMtaW5jcmVhc2luZy1sb2NhbC1mb290cHJpbnQtd2l0aC10cmFuc3BvcnQtY29tcGV0ZW5jZS1jZW50cmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Photo: Thales

Multinational technology provider Thales is intensifying its focus on the rail market in Australia and New Zealand, with plans to rapidly grow its local transportation capabilities in New South Wales, then extending to other states.

Thales Group’s Australian GM for Transport Elias Barakat tells Rail Express the company is leveraging recent success and the presence of more opportunities, to develop a Transport Competence Centre at its site in Rydalmere, in Sydney’s west.

Such a Centre would include a rail innovation lab and test facility in Sydney, including all the equipment and people necessary to engineer, test, commission and demonstrate Thales’ signalling and communications solutions for the metro, light rail, and mainline rail sectors.

“We’ve already been able to establish our local capability in metro rail off the back of our work on the Sydney Metro Northwest project,” Barakat says, referring to Thales’ work providing a Central Control System and Communication System for the newly-opened metro line. “At our Rydalmere lab we’ve set up an integration and test facility for a metro central control system and comms solutions – passenger information, public address and so on. We’ve recruited local talent, and brought in team members from overseas who have become local through that.”

Next, to build on the Centre’s light rail capabilities, Thales will leverage its delivery of the signalling and communications systems for the Parramatta Light Rail project.

“In terms of setting up our capabilities for light rail, Parramatta Light Rail is acting as the first cab off the rank. We are currently working with Thales Italy, the solution lead for light rail systems within Thales, but our intention is to do more of this light rail work in Australia, and rely less on Italy.”

And finally, for mainline, Thales has worked in the past on Sydney Trains’ Common Telemetry Infrastructure Platform and provided mainline signalling products such as axle counters to a number of customers across Australia. Now, Thales is targeting Transport for NSW’s $880 million Digital Systems program, which will bring ETCS Level 2, Automatic Train Operation, and a modern Traffic Management System to the Sydney Trains network. Barakat says Thales is also incorporating demonstrations to showcase these signalling solutions into their Sydney facility.

“We have good capabilities and products in both areas of signalling and Traffic Management Systems globally, but our focus at the moment is setting up a team here [in Sydney] made up of people with knowledge of the local network, and more experts from our Thales organisation in Germany and Spain who have been brought here.”

Barakat says the presence of a local Transport Competence Centre will majorly benefit its customers.

“The most important element of this is to give clients people who can support them in the same time zone, speaking the same language, all the while supported by a robust global network,” he explains. “This enables better and quicker service for their questions and queries. And it facilitates a closer working relationship with our clients and partners at earlier stages of the delivery process.”

Moreover, Barakat says, rising demand for solutions that can help operators boost the capacity of their networks is further justifying Thales’ decision to grow its transport footprint in Australia.

“The transport market in Australia is on a steep growth curve, and that’s generating a lot of interest from global players,” he says. “I think the development especially towards ETCS Level 2 and modern Traffic Management Systems give Thales the opportunity to become a major player in the Australian market, and we definitely are on a trajectory to do that.”"
Shaping the Future of European Air Defence Eurosam Opens a New Chapter for Turkey - defenceturkey.com,"Thu, 04 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlZmVuY2V0dXJrZXkuY29tL2VuL2NvbnRlbnQvc2hhcGluZy10aGUtZnV0dXJlLW9mLWV1cm9wZWFuLWFpci1kZWZlbmNlLWV1cm9zYW0tb3BlbnMtYS1uZXctY2hhcHRlci1mb3ItdHVya2V5LTM1NDPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Date: Issue 92 - July 2019

By Saffet UYANIK

The Eurosam Consortium, which celebrates its 30th anniversary this year, was established in June 1989 by three major European aerospace companies (Aerospatiale, Alenia, and Thomson-CSF) known today as MBDA Missile Systems and THALES for the development of the “Famille de missiles Sol-Air Futurs” (Future Surface-to-Air Family of missiles or FSAF).

The company headquarters is in Paris, with another facility in Rome. Eurosam was initially a joint venture between Aérospatiale, Alenia, and Thomson-CSF. Aérospatiale is part of MBDA France, and the Missile and Missile Systems department of Alenia is now MBDA Italy. Thomson CSF is now Thales Group. Thus, Eurosam is owned by MBDA France and Italy (66%) and Thales Group (33%). Thales is a global electronics company serving the Aerospace, Defence, and Information Technology market worldwide with operations in more than 50 countries and has 68,000 employees; while MBDA missile systems is a world-leading missile systems company with 10,000 employees, an annual turnover of about € 2.5 Billion and over 90 customers across the world. As Europe’s largest and most experienced defence contractors, these companies are both shareholders and subcontractors to Eurosam.

Eurosam was also one of the competitors in Turkey’s multi-billion-dollar anti-missile defence system T-LORAMIDS program in 2010. The Franko-Italian company competed in the tender with its SAMP/T ASTER 30 system against the US partnership of Raytheon and Lockheed Martin, offering the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC 3) and Guidance Enhanced Missiles (GEM-T); Russian Rosoboronexport, marketing the S-300, and Chinese CPMIEC (China Precision Machinery Import-Export Corporation), offering its FD-2000 (HQ-9) system. Although the Chinese company CPMIEC was awarded the contract by the Undersecretariat for Defence Industries (SSM) for 12 battalions of S HQ-9 in the export model called FD-2000 with an estimated value at about US$ 3.4 billion on September 26, 2013, Turkey then rescinded the contract on November 15, 2015 to develop its own national missile defence system with the use of its domestic resources.

Following the decision, Turkey launched its own project to build a similar system and awarded an 18-month contract to Eurosam, Aselsan and Roketsan for a study into the development and production of a long-range air and missile defence system. The study agreement was signed on January 05, 2018 during a meeting between Turkish President Recep Tayyip ERDOĞAN and French President Emmanuel MACRON in Paris. The three-country feasibility study is expected to produce results in 24 months with potential joint production of an anti-ballistic missile defence system. Eurosam stated that the company offers the ASTER 30 Block 1NT as part of the joint development study which will assist Turkey’s indigenous air and missile defence system development program and strengthen the co-operation between the three countries.

With 30 years of experience in anti-air missile systems, the European manufacturer Eurosam participated in IDEF 2019 this year and displayed its latest and most advanced missile defence solutions. In a time when the air defence needs of Turkey became a hot topic, we visited Eurosam’s booth at the IDEF’ 19 and had the chance to have a conservation with Eurosam Communication Manager - Mr. Eric DELEPOULLE about the company’s current activities, capabilities of its products, and the ongoing joint Long-Range Air and Missile Defence Program contract which was signed between the Presidency of Defence Industries (SSB) and Eurosam last year.

Stating that it is the 30th anniversary of Eurosam, Mr. DELEPOULLE said that “We are celebrating our 30th anniversary this year. Eurosam was established as a Franco-Italian joint venture between Thales, MBDA France, and MBDA Italy (Aerospatiale, Alenia, and Thomson-CSF) in 1989 to produce a new missile family with cooperation at the national level. Eurosam is the prime contractor and the design authority for the development, production, and sales of naval and ground-launched air-defence missile systems. Our products are currently in service of the Italian Army, Italian Navy, French Navy, French Air Force, and the Royal Navy. Included in the contract, Eurosam also provides maintenance services for five years to ensure the systems remain operational in the medium term.”

Forming the cornerstone of Europe’s naval and land-based air defence programs, the Development of ASTER missiles started in 1993 following a Memorandum of understanding signed between France and Italy for a family of future surface-to air-missiles. During the 1980s, the anti-air missiles in service of the French and Italian Armed Forces were short-range systems such as the French Crotale, Italian Aspide or American Sea Sparrow. In the early 90s, France and Italy decided to develop a domestic medium/long-range surface-to-air missile system with superior interception capability. The trials of the ASTER missiles were successfully completed in May 2001 and the system was deployed for the first time on the French nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle R91.

As a multi-national consortium, the development and initial production of Eurosam’s air-defence systems were funded by the French and Italian MoD on a 50/50 basis. Emphasizing the joint development aspect of the ASTER Missile Family, Mr. DELEPOULLE stressed the importance of cooperation between France and Italy regarding the highly connected manufacturing process of the system. “Eurosam works on the system level, after that we rely on Thales and MBDA for providing modules. For example, the launcher is manufactured by MBDA Italy, the radar is provided by Thales and the missile is produced by MBDA France. The manufacturing process is quite complex and highly interconnected. Each module uses both French and Italian subsystems. The ARABEL radar is produced by French Thales but the IFF system belongs to the Italian Leonardo. Another example is the launchers are manufactured by MBDA Italy, but they have also French made subcomponents. It is a true joint project. As the ASTER missile system belongs to both countries, you can witness situations where Italian and French companies compete against each other with the same missile in defence procurement projects. In addition, there is an agreement at the political level between France and Italy regarding the exports to the third countries. Both countries share the same vision of interests and universal values so if one country agrees to sell the system, the other one follows. It is a matter of cooperation and compromise.”

The ASTER missile family comprises ASTER 15 the short-medium range version and ASTER 30 the long-range version. There is an extensive commonality between the two variants with both missiles featuring the same missile body. ASTER 30 uses a much larger booster which increases its range and speed. ASTER Missile Family provide all-round anti-missile and anti-air protection and can intercept all types of air threats such as aircraft, UAVs, air-breathing targets, ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and sea-skimming anti-ship missiles. ASTER 15 weights 310 kg and ASTER 30 weights 450 kg. ASTER 15 has a length of 4.2 meters while ASTER 30 has a length of 4.9 meters. Both missiles have a diameter of 180mm. The shot-range version, ASTER 15 has a maximum speed of Mach 3, a maximum range of 30 km and an interception altitude of 13 km. The long-range version, ASTER 30 can reach speeds of Mach 4.5 while reaching altitudes of 30 km with a maximum range of 120 km and can perform aerial maneuvers greater than 60 Gs giving it a very high degree of maneuverability. Highly maneuvering and agile ASTER missiles use a direct thrust vector control system called “PIF-PAF” which is intentionally located at the missile’s center of gravity to maximize responsiveness to prevent ruptures under high-g maneuvers during trajectory corrections. During the flyout toward the target, ASTER can perform 90-degree trajectory changes. Both the ASTER 15 and the ASTER 30 missiles can be vertically launched from the ship based Sylver A50/A70 and American Mark 41 Vertical Launching Systems (VLS).

ASTER missiles are currently in service on board the latest naval vessels of France, Italy, and the United Kingdom. Equipped with an active RF seeker, the ASTER missile is autonomously guided and capable of simultaneously targeting and engaging multiple threats enabling it to counter saturated attacks. ASTER 15 and ASTER 30 missiles are integrated with the advanced Principal Anti Air Missile System (PAAMS-officially designated as Sea Viper by the Royal Navy) utilizing different types of C2 systems and multi-function radars on the British Type-45 destroyers and the Franco-Italian Horizon (Orizzonte) Class destroyers and FREMM frigates as well as the Charles De Gaulle and Conte Di Cavour aircraft carriers.

Mr. DELEPOULLE pointed out that these systems were developed to meet the operational requirements of modern air defence on the battlefield. Emphasizing that these requirements called for naval and ground-launched missiles capable of defeating threats as diverse as high-speed tactical missiles and highly-maneuvering aircraft in saturation attack scenarios, Mr. DELEPOULLE said: “The naval version of ASTER missiles is currently used onboard French and Italian air defence frigates as well as French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle and Italian aircraft carrier Cavour. SAMP/T, the ground-launched version of the system consists of three main modules. Each module has 8 missiles and a launcher that is connected to the main module with radio communication or fiber optic cables. We can connect 6 launchers to the system within a 10km radius to provide coverage for a wide area. The system is operated at the battalion level with C2 (Command-Control) structure through the data link or independently in autonomous mode. For target acquisition, the ASTER missiles are used in conjunction with the ARABEL radar which can detect Air-breathing Targets, Cruise Missiles, and TBMs up to 100km. The SAMP/T system can also be connected to the air defence network increasing its target detection range up to 600km. Each system consists of one C2 vehicle, one Radar, and 6 launchers. French and Italian Armed Forces operate one C2 vehicle, one radar, and four launchers per system. Because SAMP/T system uses only a single type of missile against all the threats, with 6 launchers up to 48 missiles can be fired against different targets to prevent massive air attacks.”

In order to reduce operational and logistic costs, Eurosam systems are designed as common and interoperable building blocks according to the customer-specific requirements. The main building blocks include two multi-function radars (X-Band Thales ARABEL and C-Band MBDA Missile Systems EMPAR radars) and two missiles (MBDA Missile systems ASTER 15 and ASTER 30). Both missiles share the same missile body, featuring the patented PIF-PAF dynamic control system. The only difference is the size of their booster stages with varying maximum ranges from 30 km to beyond 100 km.

Mr. DELEPOULLE: “ASTER 30, the Long-Range Version Can be Used on Both Naval and Land Platforms for Area Air Defence.”

Mr. DELEPOULLE emphasized the advantages of using one type of missile against various threats and shared information about the unique capabilities of the ASTER missiles in terms of logistics, training, and compatibility between different platforms. “There isn’t any difference between the naval and ground-launched versions of the ASTER missile. Both Italy and France use the same missile on their naval platforms and land platforms. It is a great capability in terms of logistics and operational cost. As you know the U.S. utilizes different missile systems such as Standard Missile (SM) and Patriot for naval and land platforms. With ASTER, you can use one missile for various type of missions against all kinds of targets. This commonality provides other benefits as well. For example, the French Air Force provides training to the French Navy because they use the same missile. The naval version of the system requires some minor adjustments to the missile to use onboard naval platforms. However, these are only software changes that don’t require physical modifications. Except for the trajectory software, it is the same missile. All versions of the ASTER family have the same missile body with two different boosters depending on the platform that the system deployed. ASTER 15, the short booster version is only used onboard the naval platforms for self-protection (point-defence) while the ASTER 30, the long-range version can be used on both naval and land platforms for area air defence.”

According to Eurosam’s statement, these sub-systems make up for systems that have outstanding effectiveness against saturating attacks inbound from all directions. Eurosam systems can operate either in stand-alone mode or interconnected with other weapon systems, thereby allowing their integration within a wider air defence network.

Underlining that network integration is one of the most important factors considering the performance of air defence systems, Mr. DELEPOULLE pointed out the highly accurate target acquisition technology of the system. “The given range of the ASTER 30 missile is beyond 100km. However, when we talk about the range of the missiles what really matters is actually the no escape zone of the target. The effective threat elimination range of the missile can vary depending on the type of the target and the detection distance. The point is, there are several factors that we must take into consideration when we talk about the range of the missiles. The radar, C2, and uplink capabilities of the user directly affect the performance of the system. The accuracy of the missiles is as important as the range of the missiles. The ASTER missile family has a special seeker with very high accuracy which provides the hit-to-kill capability. Although the missiles have directed fragmentation warhead, they can also use direct contact to eliminate hostile targets. the ASTER missile can use different methods to destroy threats, for example, it can neutralize TBMs or Cruise Missiles with its hit-to-kill capability or destroy hostile aircraft with proximity fragmentation. This allows the operators to use one type of missile against various targets. It absolutely provides a valuable capability considering the cost of each missile. During engagements, the system recommends different firing solutions based on the target and operational conditions. We normally recommend firing one missile per target. However, at the end of the day, it is up to the user to follow this recommendation or not. For example, the French Air Force prefers not to engage a single threat directly with two missiles.”

SAMP/T Systems Ready to Intercept! Its Readiness Level for the Battlefield Conditions is Only 25 Minutes

ASTER 30 has also been successfully incorporated into a land-based air-defence system, for the ground-based area defence mission requirements. The Eurosam SAMP/T (Surface-to-Air Missile Platform/Terrain - Sol-Air Moyenne Portée/Terrestre) system uses a network of sophisticated radars and sensors including an upgraded version of the long-range ARABEL 3D phased array radar with an improved performance developed under the ASTER 30 Block 1 upgrade program enabling it to be highly effective against all types of air threats. Thanks to its extended capabilities against higher speed and higher altitude targets, the system can intercept short-range ballistic missiles (SRBM) within a 600 km range.

In June 2016, Italy deployed a SAMP/T system to Kahramanmaraş Turkey as part of a NATO mission following a Turkish request to NATO on June 6, 2016, to further bolster Turkey’s 900 km long border with Syria. The Italian Eurosam SAMP/T long-range air-defence unit was deployed to replace German Patriot batteries that were withdrawn in 2015. The SAMP/T batteries arrived at the Turkish port of Iskenderun on 5 June along with 25 Italian Army personnel. On July 4, 2019, the Italian parliament decided to extend the mandate of the Italian SAMP/T missile defence system deployed in Turkey’s southeastern province of Kahramanmaraş until December 31, 2019.

Mr. DELEPOULLE also provided information about the operational capabilities of the Italian SAMP/T missile defence system currently deployed at Kahramanmaraş as part of a NATO mission to reinforce Turkey’s border against a possible Syrian missile threat. “Two SAMP/T systems with ASTER 30 Block 1NT missiles are currently deployed in Kahamanmaraş for nearly 3 years. The operational readiness of the SAMPT system in Kahramanmaraş is currently at 95% and it is also connected to the NATO air defence and TBM defence network. The C2 module and launchers of the SAMP/T system have integrated power units and has a significantly shorter deployment time compared to the other similar systems. Because the system does not use trailers, it is highly mobile and can be deployed under 25 minutes in battlefield conditions.”

As part of Turkey’s efforts to develop a national long-range air and missile defence system the heads of Eurosam, Aselsan and Roketsan have signed a Heads of Agreement (HoA) on July 14, 2017 in Ankara under the auspices of the Turkish Presidency of Defence Industries (SSB) to launch in-depth co-operation in the field of air and missile defence. Following this agreement, the Turkish, Italian and French defence ministers signed a Letter of Intent on November 8, 2017, to further strengthen their relationship in defence matters. The signature of these agreements showed the will of Turkish, French and Italian governments to cooperate on air and missile defence systems and was considered to be a strong token of Eurosam’s dedication to using the SAMP/T as a solution for Turkey’s air and missile defence requirements.

As a continuation of this process, on January 05, 2018, the SSB awarded Eurosam, Aselsan, and Roketsan a contract for the definition study of the future Turkish Long-Range Air and Missile Defence System. The study will define the future operational requirements of the Turkish Air Force and study the possibility of co-operation for the production of a long-range missile system, which will be based on the Aster 30 Block 1 NT (New Technology) missile. This cooperation between Eurosam and the SSB will also provide technology transfer to Turkey and bring the opportunity of export to third countries. The studies are planned to be finalized at the end of 2019. The signing of the contract for the definition study attracted a great deal of attention considering the agreement with Russia for the procurement of the S-400 system, which sparked tensions with the U.S. Government.

Regarding the ongoing process, Mr. DELEPOULLE informed us about the current situation of the joint-development program and Eurosam’s stance on the co-operation with Turkey. “Because these systems have strategic importance the procurement of these systems are negotiated at the highest level. The first agreement between the SSB, Aselsan, Roketsan, and Eurosam for the 18-month definition study phase was signed at Elysee Palace in January 2018. The aim of this study is to determine Turkey’s requirements for a long-range air and missile defence system. The contract was awarded by the SSB, which is responsible for the acquisitions as well as defining these requirements. As part of this process, Eurosam offers the ASTER 30 Block 1NT for co-production to meet the basic operational requirements of the Turkish Air Force. This joint development offer also aims to support Turkey’s indigenous air and missile defence system development program in addition to opening new export opportunities and longer-term co-operation between the three countries. France and Italy are keen on offering our NATO ally the best product we are producing. The ASTER 30 Block 1NT is derived from the B1 missile and has a new seeker operating in Ka-band. This change brings a significant performance increase. The new missile will also be capable of intercepting MRBM (Medium Range Ballistic Missiles) threats and eliminating missiles with separable warheads. However, as I have mentioned before the missile is one thing and the air defence system is another thing. For Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) capability you need a specific radar and C2 capabilities. That is the key point. Regarding the definition phase, we have been working closely with the SSB and the Turkish Air Force for 10 years. This definition study was a good opportunity to reinforce the relationship between Aselasn, Roketsan, and Eurosam because we are working as a team. We know our Turkish industrial counterparts and we know what to offer them. We are confident in what this co-operation will contribute, bringing our countries closer on a strategic level.”

Turkey is a crucial and a formidable NATO member located between Europe and the Middle East, bordering Iraq, Syria, and Iran. Safeguarding the southeastern flank of the alliance with a standout armed force, Turkish national security is under constant threat from the conflicts in the region. For decades, as part of NATO Integrated Air and Missile Defence (NIAMD), Tukey relied on NATO partners to protect its territory especially against ballistic missiles. Currently, Spanish and Italian Patriot (PAC-2) and SAMP-T systems are deployed at Turkey’s southwest border to defend Turkey from ballistic missile threats from Syria. However, these systems do not cover all of the 900 km long border with Syria. As a result, under constant threat from the adversary neighbors, Turkey has made considerable efforts to acquire foreign air and missile defence systems while also researching and developing indigenous defence systems. With the beginning of the Syrian civil war and the cancellation of the Turkish Air Force Long Range Air and Missile Defence System (T-LORAMIDS) program, Turkey reprioritized the procurement of a long-range missile defence systems and decided to buy Russian S-400 systems which raised concern among other NATO member countries. Apart from the Russian S-400 deal, Turkey continued to work on a domestic missile defence program. A short time after the S-400 purchase, Turkey signed an agreement with Eurosam for a study about the possible joint development of a missile defence system. The feasibility agreement with Eurosam will not only contribute to the development of the domestic defence industry but also provide new opportunities for Turkey to market a product with high added value to the world. Carrying out studies on high altitude air defence systems for a long time, Turkey aims to develop indigenous air defence systems against aerial threats in the medium to long term with joint R&D studies. Thanks to this strategic step to improve the national defence industry, Turkey will also increase its contribution to the Alliance by investing in a system that will enhance NATO interoperability and strengthen the airspace of allied member states. If finalized, the Eurosam agreement will reinforce Turkey’s position in the alliance by showing that Turkey is still committed to the security of its allies even while prioritizing its national security"
Drones become new rail workers - RailTech.com,"Wed, 17 Jul 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWx0ZWNoLmNvbS9wb2xpY3kvMjAxOS8wNy8xNy9kcm9uZXMtYmVjb21lLW5ldy1yYWlsLXdvcmtlcnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Source: PKP Cargo

The usage of drone technology is upcoming in the railway industry. More and more railway companies use them in various areas. What roles could the unmanned aerial vehicles play in the rail sector of the future?

In December 2016 the US-based e-commerce giant Amazon made a revolution. The company tested a first parcel delivery with the help of a drone. The unmanned aerial vehicle supplied a tablet device to the customer in 13 minutes. At the moment, such a revolution is hard to imagine on rails. However, several railway companies have already made some steps towards dronisation.

Station workers

The latest news about railway drones has come from the Netherlands. The Dutch national railway operator Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS) announced its plans to use the drones for the inspections of train stations. The company considers the measure as an important step for reducing its costs and improving the service. According to NS, the unmanned aerial vehicles will fly over the train stations and platforms. They will make photos and videos of the infrastructure objects. With the help of the drones, NS intends to improve the maintenance of the train stations. Currently, it is unclear whether aerial vehicles could replace the station workers. Let’s wait for the results of the Dutch tests.

Track maintenance

Besides the train stations, drones are capable to monitor the railway tracks. The British rail infrastructure Network Rail has already used them for track inspection. The unmanned aerial vehicles are equipped with a heat-sensitive 4k camera. It helps to identify the damages of the tracks. Network Rail considers drones as a good option in track maintenance: the flights do not require to close the railways for train traffic. Deutsche Bahn intends to adopt the British experience. The German company also plans to use drones for infrastructure monitoring. These endeavours confirm that the unmanned aerial vehicles have a large potential in track maintenance. Who knows, perhaps, in the coming years, we will see how the drones deliver rails or sleepers to the installation points instead of trucks or special wagons.

Train drivers

Could the drones replace the train drivers? It is a controversial issue. However, they could definitely play an important role in implementing the Automatic Train Operation (ATO). To this end, the French technology company Thales has started to develop special drones. They will serve the ‘eyes’ for the autonomous train. The company noted that the aerial vehicles will fly ahead of the train in order to monitor the tracks for the safe trip. Thales plans to equip its railway drones called as Railbots with advanced optronics, infra-red sensors and other technologies.

Railway guards

For many years, PKP Cargo, the largest rail freight operator in Poland, has been suffering from the thefts of goods from their trains. Usually, the thieves steal the coal at the railway junctions when the train makes a stop at a railway junction. In 2015 the rail company decided to purchase two drones for crime-fighting. The unmanned aerial vehicles began to monitor the railway stations in the Silesia region. The results were impressive: the number of thefts decreased by 60 per cent during the first years of the drone flights. Therefore, PKP Cargo extended the fleet of ‘aerial guards’ by acquiring the third drone in 2017. All the aerial vehicles are still in service."
