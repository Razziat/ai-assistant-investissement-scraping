The operational modification will bring the system to the highest operational status again, capable of dealing with current and future threats. In addition, this contract solves various obsolescence issues. The enhanced surface target mode of Goalkeeper, in combination with a new frangible ammunition, provides Goalkeeper with the capability to act also as a highly effective defence weapon against surface targets including speed boats.

Goalkeeper‚Äôs prediction capabilities will be substantially increased through the use of new algorithms and state-of-the-art Electro-Optic tracking capabilities. This enables Goalkeeper to successfully engage the latest generation of missiles. Multi-Goalkeeper deployment capabilities will also be improved. Goalkeeper was developed in the 1980s; these modifications enable its deployment until 2025.



The first Goalkeeper will be modified in 2015 and will be performed by Thales. All other Goalkeepers will be modified by the Royal Netherlands Navy at the naval base in Den Helder.



The contract includes an option for the two Goalkeeper systems on board of the M-class frigates of the Royal Belgian Navy. This option would ensure identical configurations and facilitate maintenance.



About Goalkeeper

Goalkeeper is a close-in defence system against highly manoeuvrable missiles and aircraft. It is an autonomous and fully automatic system which detects and tracks targets, opens fire and performs kill assessment for several targets simultaneously. Continuous search with track-while-scan provides an automatic and fast switch-over to the next-priority target in multiple-target scenarios. Goalkeeper assures timely detection of small and supersonic targets, even in dense clutter and jamming environments. Pin-point tracking of sea-skimming targets is assured by the unique dual-frequency track radar. Last but not least, the high-rate-of-fire Gatling 30-mm gun and special ammunition provide the lethal power necessary to destroy missile warheads. Goalkeeper's excellent performance was clearly demonstrated during various live firing trials. A total of 63 Goalkeepers have been sold to Navies in Europe, the Middle East and the Far East.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.9989989399909973}",positive,0.9989989399909973,1

Cranfield graduate brings aviation technology expertise - Times of Malta,"Wed, 14 Nov 2012 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzb2ZtYWx0YS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9DcmFuZmllbGQtZ3JhZHVhdGUtYnJpbmdzLWF2aWF0aW9uLXRlY2hub2xvZ3ktZXhwZXJ0aXNlLjQ0NTUwONIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Aviation has fascinated Matthew Sammut since he was a child. He would go to the airport to watch aircraft, attend airshows, explore mechanisms, and sign up to aviation-related courses.

At 22, after obtaining a first class Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Electrical Engineering with honours at the University of Malta, he decided it was time to merge his passion with his career. The natural step was to further his studies at a top UK university and he enrolled for a Master‚Äôs programme in Aerospace Vehicle Design (Avionics System Design) at Cranfield University.

At Cranfield, Mr Sammut was exposed to everything from inertial and satellite navigation systems to the cockpit environment and aircraft dynamics at lectures led by industry experts from such organisations as Airbus, Thales and ARINC. A unique feature of the course was the group design project during which all students work together to design an aircraft. Students were required to deliver a complete design. During the 2010-2011 academic year, the project task was to develop an Advanced Tilt-Rotor aircraft, dubbed the ‚ÄòV-10 Sparrowhawk‚Äô.

Mr Sammut‚Äôs task was to design the autopilot, including the automatic landing system. His work included several considerations such as detailed consideration of system failure modes to ensure that the design would be safe for operation in commercial aviation.

The programme also required students to complete an individual research project, culminating in a thesis. Mr Sammut‚Äôs thesis on multivariable parameter optimisation of flight trajectories was supervised by David Zammit-Mangion, one of the avionics lecturers at Cranfield University who is also an academic at the University of Malta.

The motivation behind the project was the work being carried out by Prof. Zammit-Mangion and his team at Clean Sky, the world‚Äôs largest research programme focusing on the greening of air transport.

Partly funded by the European Commission, Clean Sky brings the major European industrial partners together with leading research establishments from the European Research Area to develop breakthrough technologies to reduce the impact of aviation on the environment.

Cranfield University, with international partners including Airbus, Thales Avionics, EADS-IW, NLR, DLR, Delft University of Technology and the University of Malta, is working on the identification of optimal flight trajectories that can enable the reduction of CO2 and NOx emissions and noise pollution.

The consortium has been developing and using a trajectory optimisation tool, called GATAC and Mr Sammut‚Äôs work contributed to this activity. His contribution involved studying and validating fuel-efficient climb trajectories using GATAC and determining a novel strategy to enable quick optimisation to be carried out on board aircraft in real time in their flight management systems.

Following the completion of his studies, Mr Sammut returned to Malta and works at the University with Prof. Zammit-Mangion and the Clean Sky Team of the Department of Electronic Systems Engineering. He now forms part of a group excelling in research in aeronautics at the University of Malta, putting the skills he developed in his academic studies to good use for the benefit of the country.

Mr Sammut‚Äôs studies were made possible thanks to the Strategic Education Pathways Scholarship (STEPS) Scheme which is part-financed by the European Union.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999954700469971}",neutral,0.9999954700469971,0
