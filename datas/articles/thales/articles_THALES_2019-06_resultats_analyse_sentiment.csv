The International Paris Air Show

Thales designs the skies of the future

The 53rd edition of the International Paris Air Show will be held at Le Bourget Parc des Expositions from 17 to 23 June 2019, and will once again bring together all the major industry players around the latest technological innovations. The first four days of the show will be reserved for trade visitors, followed by three days open to the general public.

In 2017 the Show hosted 2,380 exhibitors from 48 countries, 290 official delegations from nearly 100 countries and some 322,000 visitors.

Thales will of course be one of the main exhibitors at this not-to-be-missed event, which will allow it to demonstrate its leadership in the mastery of the critical decision chain based on its four technological pillars (AI, Big Data, connectivity/IoT and cybersecurity) and its tremendous capacity for innovation in helping its customers to achieve their big ambitions and to respond to the challenges of their sectors of activity. This will enable Thales to position itself as a trusted partner, supporting customers in their digital transformation and offering new ways of working within new ecosystems.

Defence: future air combat

In the defence field Thales’s presentations and demonstrations will be structured around collaborative and connected future air

combat. The company will be demonstrating how an effective, secure collaboration between all of the interconnected players and objects of the combat system enables the situation to be defined, understood and shared and allows the organisation of joint operations to handle it in the best possible way. The opportunities that digitisation provides to leverage this shared information allows forces to remain one step ahead of the enemy, which is the key to operational superiority.

Thales will also be showcasing its augmented C4I, a system of systems based on a resilient air command and control system powered by AI and big data and by cybersecured clouds which allow collaborative combat in a joint and allied warfare context. In addition, it will be presenting a connectivity solution which provides end-to-end services that are secure and can be adapted to different airborne platforms in the combat space. There will also be a focus on force preparation training within the context of joint warfare collaborative combat.

Space: rapid and profound transformation

In the field of space, the Group will be showing its capacity to help its business and government customers face up to the fast-paced and far-reaching developments in the industry: a reduction in the demand for television matched by an explosion in the demand for internet, cyberthreats, the need to be connected anytime and anywhere, the complexity of missions and solutions and the rapid emergence of new players.

These are all challenges that digital technologies are helping to face: software-defined satellites, continuous optical and radar observation, onboard intelligence, cost-effective connectivity, sensors, data fusion and new space infrastructures. The software emerging today protects data, and allows decisions to be made more quickly and new applications to be deployed.

Air travel: redefining the passenger experience

Lastly, in the field of air transport, Thales will be presenting solutions that make intelligent aircraft a reality, for example in the field of communications, mission management and data integration. The Group will also be demonstrating its ability to be at the heart of the new air travel ecosystem, notably with regard to airports, cabin connectivity, and the safety and cybersecuring of all aircraft components.

Furthermore, since the ultimate goal is to meet passengers’ needs, Thales intends to position itself as the future world leader in mobility-related services, bringing passengers the benefits of a seamless and secure experience from door to door: online check-in, autonomous public transport, intelligent airport security, customised in-flight services and even drone taxis on arrival.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9833078384399414}",neutral,0.9833078384399414,0

When the moon passes in front of the sun, creating an eclipse, the skies turn dark in the middle of the day, a terrifying thing to ancient people. Source: (irishcentral.com) The solar eclipse of August 2017, was historic in that a record number of people flocked to the path of totality to witness the amazing event. The eclipse of May, 585 BC, was also historic, but for a different reason. This celestial event, which came to be known as the Eclipse of Thales, marked an important time when the sun and moon were instrumental in ending a war.

The 6 year long war between the Lydians and the Medes in ancient Turkey was ended with a solar eclipse happened. Source: (timetoast.com) An Epic War By the year 585 BC, the Lydians, people from Lydia in what is now Turkey, and the Medes, an ancient Iranian people, had been at war for nearly six years. Both sides were evenly matched and, although each side won important battles, the war itself seemed to be at a stalemate, with neither side showing any signs of giving up. It seemed as though the fighting could go on indefinitely.

The Lydian army. Source: (factsanddetails.com) The Sky Darkens The soldiers were engaged in battle on May 28, 585 BC, the sky suddenly turned dark. The entire battlefield and the surrounding countryside were plunged into darkness. The men on both sides of the front line were frightened and surprised. They stood in shock during the duration of the eclipse, which lasted only a few minutes. When the moon moved from in front of the Sun and the daylight returned to the land, the scared soldiers threw down their weapons and declared an end to the fighting. A truce soon followed.

Herodotus gave an account of the 585 BC eclipse about a century later. (worldatlas.com) The Written Account Came a Century Later The story of how the war between the Lydians and the Medes came to an end first appeared in writing almost a hundred years after the eclipse halted the battle. It was written by the ancient Greek historian, Herodotus. In this account, we find an intriguing reference to Thales of Miletus, an ancient philosopher, who may have predicted the eclipse. Herodotus wrote, “Thales of Miletus had foretold this loss of daylight to the Ionians, fixing it within the year in which the change did indeed happen.” Did Thales of Miletus really predict the eclipse that ended the Lydian-Medes war?

Source: (Photo by Ken Welsh Corbis via Getty Images) Who was Thales? Long before Socrates and Plato, there was Thales of Miletus. Considered the forerunner of a modern scientist, Thales was unusual for his time in that he used scientific observation and hypotheses to explain natural phenomenon instead of relying on myths and attributing unknown occurrences to the mythical gods of ancient Greece. He was a scientist, mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher. He even pioneered the concept of trading options. He developed geometry theorems and wowed his contemporaries by being able to calculate the distances of ships at sea and the height of the Pyramids of Egypt by using geometry. He was a brilliant man who was ahead of his time, but did he predict the coming of the 585 BC eclipse?

The path of totality for the 585 BC eclipse. Source: (raremaps.com) The Eclipse Modern astronomers have been able to calculate backward to determine that the eclipse that caused the truce between the Lydians and the Medes took place on May 28, 585 BC. The path of totality for this eclipse extended from Nicaragua in Central America, across the Atlantic Ocean, and through France, Italy, and Turkey. The battlefield in present-day Turkey where the Lydians and Medes armies were engaged in battle would have been on the path of totality. Miletus, the home of Thales, was just outside the path of totality, but close enough for the eclipse to be a memorable event.

In Thales's time, philosopohers believed the Earth was flat. Source: (wiki.tfes.org) Casting Doubts on Thales of Miletus Historians and astronomers are not so quick to credit Thales of Miletus with accurately predicting the 585 BC eclipse, as Herodotus claimed he did. Although he was a scientist, Thales did not have the scientific instruments needed to calculate an eclipse. In fact, Thales believed, like all of his contemporaries, that the Earth was flat. It is also intriguing that Herodotus said Thales predicted the eclipse to the correct year, but not date. Astronomy is an exact science. If a person is able to predict a solar eclipse at all, they would be able to conclude the exact date, not merely the year.

The ancient Babylonians were advanced in astronomy and kept careful records. Source: (ancientpages.com) Did Thales Just Get Lucky? The current belief is that Thales simply got really lucky in his prediction of the eclipse of 585 BC. He may have acquired ancient knowledge from Babylonian astronomers and based his calculation on those. He may have analyzed the Saros cycle, a complex cycle of reoccurring eclipses. His calculations could have been no more than educated guesses – this could account for his prediction that the eclipse would fall within a year, rather than pinpointing an exact date. Then, when the eclipse did occur, Thales claimed his prediction came true.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9993680119514465}",neutral,0.9993680119514465,0
MAST Asia: Thales Pitching Artemis IRST for JMSDF 30FFM Baseline 2 - Naval News,"Tue, 18 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdmFsbmV3cy5jb20vZXZlbnQtbmV3cy9tYXN0LWFzaWEtMjAxOS8yMDE5LzA2L21hc3QtYXNpYS10aGFsZXMtcGl0Y2hpbmctYXJ0ZW1pcy1pcnN0LWZvci1qbXNkZi0zMGZmbS1iYXNlbGluZS0yL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"MAST Asia: Thales Pitching Artemis IRST for JMSDF 30FFM Baseline 2

At MAST Asia 2019, the defense exhibition and conference currently held near Tokyo, Japan, Thales is showcasing the Artemis infra-red search and track (IRST) system.

A Thales Japan representative told Naval News that the company is currently proposing the Artemis IRST to the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) future 30FFM Baseline 2 frigate.

According to Thales, Artemis is a fully passive infrared surveillance system able to automatically detect, track and classify both air and surface tar-gets simultaneously. Artemis is able to detect and track maneuvering and stealthy threats as well as surface asymmetric threats. The distributed sensor architecture allows Artemis to perform a full panoramic and wide elevation coverage without any blind sector.

Artemis is able to detect and track maneuvering and stealthy new threats (fighter aircraft, sea-skimming anti-ship mis-sile) as well as surface asymmetric threats (fast attack ship, small craft, jet ski).

Artemis is the IRST system fitted aboard the FREMM multi-mission frigates of the French Navy as well as on aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle.

According to Thales, there is currently no equivalent system used by the JMSDF or proposed by the Japanese industry. Thales could offer the Artemis solution via a cooperation with the local industry. Thales has previously cooperated with local companies such as Itachi and more recently with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for the OZZ-5 UUV (fitted with Thales SAMDIS sonars).

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is currently under contract to build the first 30FFM frigate of the first baseline, while Mitsui will build the second one (of baseline 1). The 30FFM program calls for a total of 20 frigates, including 8 in the baseline 1 configuration. The baseline 2 will feature more advanced systems. There will be a baseline 3 down the road as well.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999945163726807}",neutral,0.9999945163726807,0

MTG’s contract is a DBFM (design, build, finance, maintain) project awarded by Metrolinx, with the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) as operator. The project is slated for completion and revenue service in 2023, and includes a 30-year maintenance service contract that will be performed by MTG.

The 11-km (6.8-mile) Finch West line, with 18 stops between Humber College and the Finch West subway station, will provide new transit access to the historically underserviced northwest area of Toronto. It will connect to the TTC Line 1 Yonge-University subway, “making commuting to work and school much faster and easier for northwest Toronto residents, and have the added advantages of providing an economic boost and social benefit to the area,” MTG noted. “The Greater Toronto Area has a growing population and is facing significant traffic and transit congestion. The Finch West LRT is how Metrolinx and the Province of Ontario are expanding the public transit system to address these problems to make life faster, better and safer for GTHA (Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area) residents and their families.”

“The Finch West LRT project allows Thales to be a big part of a world class city’s expansion for the better,” said Dominique Gaiardo, Vice President and Managing Director for Thales’ Urban Rail Signaling business. “We are putting to work our local, made-in-Ontario SelTrac™ CBTC technology as a key part of this project, which will bring long-awaited transit service to northwest Toronto.”

Thales is also the signaling supplier on the new Ottawa LRT Confederation Line. The company says its “experience and proven track record of success with LRT means that there is a much lower integration risk when these systems are installed and put into service and operation.”

Thales’ Toronto office has more than 1,200 employees, including more than 900 engineers and 30,000 square feet of simulation lab space for software testing. Its “made-in-Ontario” SelTrac™ technology was the first CBTC system in the world and was implemented in the 1980s on Toronto’s Scarborough Rapid Transit and Vancouver’s SkyTrain fully automated (driverless) systems.","{'label': 'Positive', 'score': 0.945541501045227}",positive,0.945541501045227,1

This connected equipment benefits from a sleek new design and new functionality for operators and motorists.

Parking charges are paid simply by presenting a smartphone or contactless payment card.

At Parkopolis, the biennial gathering for the world’s parking and mobility professionals starting tomorrow, Thales is unveiling its new range of car park solutions with added functionality.

The new Thales range is designed for enclosed aboveground and underground public parking facilities with entry and exit control barriers. All equipment in the range has been redesigned, from entrance and exit barriers to pedestrian access points, private parking areas and pay stations, with dynamic graphic display. The back office IT system, which allows supervision and generates the necessary reports, also boasts new functionality.

Drivers can now pay parking charges using any contactless method: payment card or smartphone with NFC (near-field communication) or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). They can also pre-book a parking space in just a few clicks, using the Transcity™ Park app from Thales.

Operators can monitor parking facilities and identify problems or equipment faults from their smartphone.

The new range is also designed to boost revenues from all types of parking facilities — city, rail station, airport, shopping centre, hospital, etc. — by introducing variable fee schedules, based on the principle of yield management. Inspired by the hotel and air transport sectors, it uses a dynamic pricing policy derived from analysis of car park usage histories.

Thales is a major force in the car parking market and a leading partner of cities and semi-public companies, urban mobility players and large-scale operators in France.

The company has over 500 customers in France and has worked on projects in Europe (Luxembourg, Switzerland, Belgium, Italy, etc.) and internationally (Gautrain park-and-ride projects in South Africa, Dubai, etc.).

Lightweight Multirole Missile proves it's a hit at sea - Thales,"Fri, 28 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi91bml0ZWQta2luZ2RvbS9uZXdzL2xpZ2h0d2VpZ2h0LW11bHRpcm9sZS1taXNzaWxlLXByb3Zlcy1pdHMtaGl0LXNlYdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Lightweight Multirole Missile proves it’s a hit at sea Share this article



LinkedIn

A missile system designed to combat agile, asymmetrical surface-based threats has proven its potential for a maritime role after a scoring seven out of seven hits in a successful firing trial “at sea”.

Naval forces are becoming increasingly concerned by the asymmetrical warfare or terrorist threat posed by operators from Fast Inshore Attack Craft, RIBs or even jet skis. However the versatile, stabilisation and precision guidance of the Lightweight Multirole Missile (LMM), developed by Thales, may offer a simple solution.

At a range of 5.5km, LMM lived up to its multirole title against a five-metre target towed at 20 knots to simulate a speedboat terrorist attack during a trial at a UK coastal range in April.

To demonstrate its capability to hit a moving target from a moving platform, a naval Missile Integrated Launcher System (MILAS) developed by Thales and Aselsan was mounted on a six degrees of freedom table, which can simulate the motion of any vessel, from a small patrol vessel to a frigate up to Sea State Four.

Despite the challenging environment the LMM telemetry rounds (no warhead), were successfully guided and achieved a hit within a metre of the target. A final Combat standard (Warhead) LMM achieved a direct hit of the small target causing severe damage to the vessel.

“We held this trial to test the firing platform and the missile and show they can be fired from a ship,” said Thales spokesperson in Belfast. “It was a great success, showing the precision strike capability of LMM against small targets works in difficult environments. This trial was as representative as you can get without actually putting it on a boat.

“The theory is proven and next setup is to put the launcher system on the ship and test it for real, which will be carried out later in the year.”

Thales expects the trial, shown on the video above, to excite global interest.

Land and air tested

LMM is built in Belfast by Thales and the mature product has already been proven during a verification process with UK MOD and is due to enter service with the British Army this year. Fired from a tripod launcher (LML-NG), a mobile wheeled vehicle (RAPIDRanger) and the Stormer vehicle, LMM will provide defence against surface and air targets.

Thales has also been contracted to supply LMM to the Royal Navy under the FASGW(L), Future Anti Surface Guided Weapon (Light) programme. It is being integrated on the Royal Navy’s Wildcat Helicopter and the programme is due to be completed in 2020.

The recent firing proves LMM’s capability to defeat agile FIAC targets and Thales is now preparing to conduct the next stage of qualification with technical trials from a Royal Navy warship.

What makes LMM different?

LMM’s stabilising system, guidance and precision strike capability, make it ideal for a ‘cluttered’ naval environment. The MILAS firing system provides accurate stabilisation of its electro optics, to ensure accurate target tracking and the correct launch angles for the missile, allowing operators to guide the missile onto its target regardless of sea spray or platform motion.

The stabilised LMM Pannier is also highly versatile and can be integrated onto other gun system mounts.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9992706179618835}",neutral,0.9992706179618835,0

AirEmploi, the leading Aerospace Employment Forum, spotlighted a great initiative at the Paris Air Show aimed at inspiring young women to pursue careers in the aerospace industry. A contest is held every two years for teams of female students from 25 middle and senior high schools across France. On June 18th, the first prize was awarded to students from the Lycée Jules Ferry high school in Cannes, whose mentors are engineers at Thales Alenia Space. As part of the initiative, Thales Alenia Space had opened its doors to eight girls from the school on International Women's Day on March 8 this year to present career opportunities available in the space sector.

Our young award winners were clearly thrilled to be taking part and could hardly contain their enthusiasm when they visited the Space Experience on the Thales stand! We actively encourage this type of initiative, which enables young women to see for themselves what a great variety of careers are on offer in the space sector — and perhaps inspire a few vocations! At Thales Alenia Space, our expertise spans a broad range of areas, from satellite telecommunications and Earth Observation to navigation and space exploration. This means that the men and women who work for us can be involved in a whole host of different projects concerning subjects such as bridging the digital divide, environmental management, meteorology, oceanography, and deep space exploration. In fact, some of them have even worked on a satellite called the Trace Gas Orbiter, launched on the 2016 ExoMars mission, that is in orbit around Mars!

Space plays an integral role in our everyday lives. It connects people around the globe via the Internet or mobile phones, and helps protect our planet and the people on it. For example, when you find your way using the GPS on your smartphone (and now via Europe’s own Galileo system), you can do so thanks to space technology.

Thales Alenia Space is active in every aspect of the industry. Did you know for instance that, when you check the weather forecast, the data is transmitted by satellites made by Thales Alenia Space? Or that the amazing photos of our planet shared on social media by ESA astronaut Thomas Pesquet were taken from the Cupola on the International Space Station (ISS) which was designed and developed by Thales Alenia Space in Turin? We also had the privilege to welcome Thomas Pesquet as an intern in our Thales Alenia Space’s Cannes plant in 2001. True story!

Space technology is involved in just about everything we do! Our mission at Thales Alenia Space is embodied in “Space for Life”. This is the purpose of the women and men who work at our 17 sites in nine countries.

Is the space industry a ""man's world""? Far from it! From engineers and technicians to managers and world-renowned experts, Thales Alenia Space has many outstanding women on its staff! Among them, we also have a windsurf champ, Claire Tetard, who will attend the Olympic Games! And they’re all passionate about space and technology.

Diversity and inclusion are top priorities for the Thales Group. Whether it's gender or culture, we believe that workplace diversity is one of our greatest assets.

We were keen to be involved alongside AirEmploi which, through its active engagement with companies, high schools and training providers, helps to combat stereotypes and revamp the image of the aerospace industry.

""Our participation alongside AirEmploi is perfectly in line with Thales Alenia Space's commitment to diversity and inclusion,"" explains Laura Berneri, Communications Director at Thales Alenia Space, who represented the company during the ceremony.

So once again, kudos to our three high-school students for their success and to Air Emploi for this fantastic initiative!

On June 17, 2009, Thales Alenia Space announced its first contract with Orbital Sciences Corporation (now Northrop Grumman), for the design, development and production of nine pressurized cargo modules (PCM) on Cygnus resupply vessels for the International Space Station (ISS).

Thales Alenia Space has supplied cargo modules to Northrop Grumman since the start of the Cygnus program. The first contract in 2009 provided for the delivery of nine modules, while a second contract in 2016 added nine more. Eleven operational PCMs plus a demo have been launched to date, four in the original version and eight in the enhanced version.

Cygnus: a lifeline to astronauts since 2013

© Esa/NASA

Designed to transport supplies (food, water, spare parts, scientific experiments, etc.), Cygnus resupply vessels play a vital role for astronauts on the International Space Station. The Cygnus spacecraft has evolved over the last few years into more than just a dedicated cargo carrier.

Cyg-nificant Science!

For instance, in 2015, a Cygnus carried a key scientific experiment, designed to test 3D printing technology under zero gravity conditions. The spaceborne portable 3D printer was used in the ISS to make a small object from polymer materials: a European first! The Cygnus hosted a series of three Spacecraft Fire Safety Experiments, or SAFFIRE, developed by NASA to study flammability and fire propagation under zero gravity conditions with the aim of improving crew safety.

New improved Saffire experiments are planned to fly on the new fleet of future PCM modules. Continuing to support “zero g” scientific experiments that cannot be done elsewhere, ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli tested PERSEO (PErsonal Radiation Shielding for interplanetary missiOns), a special radiation protection vest, and ARAMIS (Augmented Reality Application for Maintenance, Inventory and Stowage) during the #VITA mission in 2017.

40% of the ISS built by Thales Alenia Space

The PCMs are built by Thales Alenia Space in Turin for prime contractor Northrop Grumman. Thales Alenia Space designed this module by capitalizing on its experience in making orbital infrastructures for the International Space Station. The ISS actually holds a special place in the hearts of Thales Alenia Space engineers based in Turin. Thales Alenia Space has supplied fully half of the pressurized volume on the ISS (40% of the entire station), including Nodes 2 and 3, the Multipurpose Module (MMP), Multipurpose Logistics Modules (MPLM), Cupola, Columbus lab structure, the pressurized cargo module for ATV resupply vessels and the structure for the Bishop commercial airlock from NanoRacks.

As NASA shifts its priorities to sending astronauts to the moon, it is opening the International Space Station for commercial business, agency officials announced on June 7.

By providing expanded opportunities to manufacture, market and promote commercial products and services via the International Space Station, NASA hopes to catalyze and develop the space market for many different businesses.

“For Thales Alenia Space the NASA decision may represent a great opportunity for the commercial exploitation of the product and services that can be derived or developed from the existing company portfolio,” said Walter Cugno, Vice President, Exploration and Science at Thales Alenia Space.

Beyond the ISS

Thales Alenia Space is gearing up for lunar missions, in particular with the LOP-G (Lunar Orbital Platform Gateway), and is carrying out design studies for NASA (as part of STEP 2) and ESA. Furthermore, following the success of the IXV atmospheric reentry demonstrator, Thales Alenia Space is developing Space Rider, Europe’s new-generation, low-orbit, reusable space transport system.

"Connected fighter jet, the cornerstone of collaborative air combat - Thales","Mon, 17 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUtZGVmZW5jZS9yYWRpby1jb21tdW5pY2F0aW9ucy9uZXdzL2Nvbm5lY3RlZC1maWdodGVyLWpldC1jb3JuZXJzdG9uZS1jb2xsYWJvcmF0aXZlLWFpctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Cruising at Mach 1.2 over hostile territory, flight lieutenant Johan is returning from a reconnaissance mission at the controls of the lead aircraft. He's about to land his latest-generation fighter jet on the deck of an aircraft carrier, just like Grégoire, who is flying another fighter a few hundred metres behind him in combat formation.

The year is 2026 and they're part of an international coalition fighting the terrorist threat. It’s Johan's first live overseas mission with the new aircraft, and he feels somewhat relieved that everything has gone to plan.

The newest versions of this plane were only delivered a year ago. Despite the many training flights he’s done, Johan’s as impressed as ever with the aircraft's strike capabilities, its discretion and above all its connectivity.

That's because the latest standard of these fighter jets features the NEXEN communications server developed by Thales. The size of a shoebox, it’s packed with the latest technologies and has the potential to become a game-changer in terms of air combat communications.

Shared connections

NEXEN ties together all the available satcom and radio systems, keeping Johan in permanent contact with:

• Coalition and national command centres

• The other units engaged in the theatre (aircraft, naval forces, ground troops, etc.)

The two pilots suddenly receive an order to divert to a hostile target approximately 100 kilometres to the north. They bank 90 degrees and head off. Grégoire’s aircraft doesn’t have a satcom link, but using the service provided by the lead aircraft he can communicate directly with the command centres because NEXEN extends the connectivity of all the aircraft assigned to that particular operation.

The national command centre gives the pilots details of their mission: a SIGINT aircraft has intercepted a satellite radio call on a frequency used by terrorists. A UAV is doing a reconnaissance sweep of the area in an attempt to get a visual on the target, which may need to be neutralised.

Managing the mission, flying the plane and communicating all at once

A screen on Johan's instrument panel displays all the units and all the connections offered by NEXEN. One by one, the assets engaged in the new mission appear on the screen, forming a community of interest (COI) specific to this mission. The system is so intuitive that Johan can manage his communications, fly the aircraft and manage the mission all at the same time.

A new player appears on the connectivity screen. It’s a tanker plane, which has been brought in to refuel the fighters. Johan uses the chat function to contact the tanker crew and finalise last-minute details. Twenty minutes later or so, both fighters have filled up and can continue their mission.

As they advance, new elements are added to the COI on Johan’s screen. The SIGINT plane appears first, then the reconnaissance UAV, followed by the special forces unit on the ground.

Using a satellite link, Johan contacts the UAV pilot thousands of kilometres away, who gives him the details on the target. It’s a white pickup truck with four armed individuals and a machine gun mounted on the back.

First core element of the future combat aircraft

The national command centre briefs Johan with further intelligence about the mission objective. A second call by the potential target has identified one of the parties as a key terrorist leader. The troops on the ground have been ordered to capture him — alive, if possible — and the fighter jets are ready to provide support if things go awry.

Special forces on the ground assess the situation and launch an assault. With the element of surprise on their side, they take the hostile combatants prisoner. The roar of the two fighters as they pass overhead sounds like a shout of victory. The operation has been a success.

The mission didn’t require the fighters to take any offensive action, but it showed how connectivity offers a decisive advantage over the adversary. Right to the end, the pilots were able to monitor the evolving situation in real time and make the right decisions.

From initial concept in 2013 to integration on latest-generation fighter aircraft, NEXEN is designed to offer an unrivalled level of performance and security. Thales is also working to make it interoperable with aircraft, surface vessels, vehicles and dismounted infantry units from other countries.

While always able to operate alone, more and more countries are involved in military operations by coalition forces. As combat becomes ever more collaborative, connectivity is the backbone that pulls it all together, and the NEXEN communications server, as the first core element of the collaborative air combat of the future, meets the demanding requirements of these new forms of intervention.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999899864196777}",neutral,0.9999899864196777,0

With launch scheduled in 2022, ESA's Euclid mission is making great progress on the hardware and on readying for the science phase.

New milestone in sight

The Euclid Structural Thermal Module (STM) is taking its final shape before undergoing thermo-mechanical tests. The Euclid service module (SVM), payload module (PLM), sunshield (SSH) and high-gain antenna (HGA) have been successfully mated in our clean rooms.

What’s next?

The STM will undergo full thermal and mechanical qualification tests in the coming months, paving the way for protoflight model (PFM) activities. In the meantime, integration and testing of the PFM avionics and the PLM have already started in readiness for shipping the mission’s scientific instruments—the visible wavelength camera (VIS) and the near-infrared camera/spectrometer (NISP)—before the end of this year.

A universal recipe for success

Euclid is a medium-class mission of ESA's Cosmic Vision program to investigate the expansion of our Universe over the past ten billion years, probing cosmic epochs from before when expansion started to accelerate and all the way to the present. To this end, Euclid will survey galaxies at a range of distances from Earth, over an area of the sky covering more than 35% of the celestial sphere. Thales Alenia Space is prime contractor for the construction of the satellite, which features a 1.2-m-diameter telescope, a 4.2-m x 2.5-m sunshield solar array, a 70-cm high-gain antenna and two scientific instruments: a visible-wavelength camera (VIS) and a near-infrared camera/spectrometer (NISP), both developed by the Euclid Consortium.

The Euclid Consortium comprises scientists from 13 European countries: Austria, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, Portugal, Romania and the UK. It also includes a U.S. team of scientists from NASA.

Thales High-G training fit for modern aircraft pilots - Thales,"Thu, 06 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi91bml0ZWQta2luZ2RvbS9uZXdzL3RoYWxlcy1oaWdoLWctdHJhaW5pbmctZml0LW1vZGVybi1haXJjcmFmdC1waWxvdHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales in the UK has been training Royal Air Force (RAF) aircrews for over 87 years. Since the beginning of this steadfast relationship, Thales has developed and delivered over 300 complex simulators for 60 different platforms. Thales’ new High G-force training facility for fast-jet pilots at RAF Cranwell is proof of its dedication and contribution to the RAF’s ever-expanding capabilities. The facility’s inauguration helps the RAF remain at the heart of the government’s approach to conflict and crisis management as it provides continuous development and enhancement for the RAF’s training and simulation services.

Keeping pace with modern aircraft

Modern aircraft, such as the Lightning, Typhoon and Hawk have significantly superior air combat performance and are now able to perform super manoeuvres with rapid, multi-axis motions. A great advancement for technology, but the downside is that pilots are exposed to new combinations of translational accelerations and rotational movements that lead to increased physical loads.

As a result, fast jet pilots endure tremendous amounts of g-forces during manoeuvring that can induce loss of consciousness and, in the worst cases, cause fatalities. Yet pilots are still required to undertake complex system management tasks and make quick decisions under this intense physical stress. Thankfully, pilots can be trained to combat G induced loss of consciousness (GLOC).

Training limitations

Up until recently, the only training facility available for fast jet pilots has been with the human centrifuge at Farnborough, a 62-year-old device that does not match the performance of modern fighter aircraft having a G onset rate of only 1G per second. The ground simulators used for pre-flight training provide cognitive skill training but do not replicate the physiological environment. The maximum acceleration onset rate of the device does not provide realistic training for pilots of aircraft that have acceleration onset rates of more than 10 G.s-1. This major training shortcoming is most dangerous in preparing pilots for air combat where the aircraft will be aggressively manoeuvred, imposing significant strains on both the pilot and aircraft.

The new High-G training facility

To help pilots meet training standards, Thales partnered with AMST, world-leading centrifuge specialists from Austria, to build a 39-tonne centrifuge for the new High-G training facility at RAF Cranwell. The High-G Training centrifuge accelerates from 1G to 9 G in just one second and helps pilots experience realistic flight simulation with high-resolution, out-of-the-window displays – provided by 4K projectors – to fill the forward field of view. Further training tasks are provided by the centrifuge Visual Training Cue system which includes flight through a series of gates in the sky and a missile threat/radar warning receiver. With these capabilities, pilots can better understand how to deal with the accelerations, while flying a combat aircraft and managing the mission systems.

Fast jet pilots progressing through the UK Military Flying Training System and into their careers will refresh their training at least every five years. This is carried out to keep them safe and up-to-date with current techniques to handle High-G forces and experience training under much more realistic conditions. It will, ultimately, save the lives of more fast-jet pilots.

So far, feedback from this state-of-the-art facility has been exceptional, says David Bolsover, Training Service Manager for HiG:

The pilots we’ve had in here think it's brilliant. You are sat in a real cockpit, with real controls – it gives you a real sense of immersion.

As the RAF looks to the future, Thales will continue its commitment to providing its high-technology solutions for the coming century.

Token gating: A driver for enterprise customer retention - the blockchain land,"Thu, 27 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYmxvY2tjaGFpbmxhbmQuY29tLzIwMTkvMDYvMjcvYWNjZW50dXJlLXRoYWxlcy1ibG9ja2NoYWluLWFlcm9zcGFjZS1pbmR1c3RyeS_SAVxodHRwczovL3RoZWJsb2NrY2hhaW5sYW5kLmNvbS8yMDE5LzA2LzI3L2FjY2VudHVyZS10aGFsZXMtYmxvY2tjaGFpbi1hZXJvc3BhY2UtaW5kdXN0cnkvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Accenture and Thales, a French multinational aerospace and defense systems provider, launched a blockchain-oriented system as part of their digital innovation program. In the works for the past couple of years, the solution was conceived to reorganize the configuration across the supply chain, helping to track, trace and prove origin.

But why is everyone jumping on the blockchain journey?

We’ve seen more and more industries adopting blockchain technologies as a solution to key issues. From pharmaceutical to gaming to real estate, the technology is being leveraged due to its capacity to secure immutable transactional records, information confidentiality and security.

Lately, we’ve seen blockchain’s potential in the aerospace sector. According to Accenture’s research, by 2021, 86 percent of aerospace or defense companies expect to adopt blockchain into their systems within three years. Out of 18 industries, aerospace ranked third for blockchain plans.

Facing industry pain points: blockchain to the rescue

Blockchain is seen as a way to reduce maintenance costs, increase aircraft availability and minimize errors in tracking aircraft parts.

To understand how blockchain can benefit the industry, it’s imperative to understand the pain points affecting the aerospace and defense industry. These include, but aren’t limited to:

Data configuration

Multi-echelon supply chain visibility

Quality

Authenticating supply

Certification of people and machines

Software life-cycle management

Indeed, data and its validity is a recurring issue. According to Accenture’s survey, blockchain can address several hurdles by creating a single source of truth with verified data. The study highlighted, as a critical industry pain point, the use of unreliable data which undermined the decision-making processes.

The threat of corrupted insights as a result of (potentially) falsified data, coupled with the risks of data manipulation and inherent bias attached to automation, means that the sector is turning to blockchain as a safe haven.

It’s not only about airlines but an intricate aerospace ecosystem

The challenge rests on the current data configuration, and at the moment, it sits in the internal data silos of aircraft manufacturers, maintenance providers, and airlines. It is directly linked to supply chain management and authentication of parts and products.

Naturally characterized by complex products and an intricate supply chain involving multiple dynamic participants, there’s a push to implement new technologies in the aerospace and defense sector.

It would allow for secure and trustworthy data management to be the backbone of an intricate supply chain.

To reply to these concerns, Accenture, a world-renowned professional service firm, has been working on a blockchain demo since 2016, specifically tailored to aerospace and defense industry supply chains.

“Blockchain is well-suited to improve the performance of one of the world’s most complex, globally interconnected and security-dependent supply chains,” said John Schmidt, Accenture’s Managing Director for Global Aerospace & Defense Lead.

The Accenture and Thales use case

A blockchain-based configuration management

The technology is being leveraged to “supporting secure collaboration, and process coordination across OEMs, suppliers, and operators.”

The objective is to introduce a single and shared view of the supply chain to help professionals in the field – suppliers, manufacturers and operators – carry out their job efficiently.

According to Schmidt,

“Knowing the actual configuration of an in-service aircraft at any point in time is important. Blockchain enables aerospace and defense companies to securely share, capture and authenticate data from a single source.”

Working in conjunction with Thales, the solution provides the ability to verify the authenticity of parts and supplies from beginning to end across the industry’s complex and heavily regulated supply chains. Schmidt explained:

“Blockchain technology offers a new, elegant and secure way for the industry to track and trace myriad components while deterring counterfeiting and improving maintenance capabilities.”

Based on Linux, the prototype is supported by Hyperledger Fabric, and it will accommodate three techs into one: internet-of-things, the blockchain, and other creative technologies provided by Thales.

It was showcased last year at Farnborough Air Show, and this month at the Paris Air Show 2019.

Integrating blockchain with IoT

Blockchain isn’t the only technology creating ripples of benefits across the aerospace and defense industry. In April 2018, Accenture published a report, called “Extending the Digital Thread With Blockchain”, where they explained that blockchain can be used in tandem with digital twins, which is essentially a digital replica of an existing physical asset.

By integrating it with the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, the replica modifies itself as changes to the underlying physical asset are made. When extending this idea to data flows, we have what is called a “digital thread”.

This means that the data from the digital twin can move outside the organization and “be shared by manufacturers with suppliers, partners, and operators. As a result, the potential benefits are new insights and revenue sources.”

This replica gives the customer an added value and successfully integrated information systems. It demonstrates how coupling new technologies are complementary to delivering a successful solution to industry issues.

What can we expect for the industry’s future?

“Accenture Technology Vision 2018”, the company’s annual technology report, predicts the top technology trends likely to disrupt the sector in the next three years.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expected to be the primary source of investment, with two-thirds (67%) of companies planning to invest in it next year, initially focusing on production, security and R&D. A significant portion – 80% – are confident the workforce will feel the effects of AI-based decisions on their daily tasks by 2021.

Meanwhile, 57% plans to invest in augmented reality and virtual reality, with 96% believing extended reality will be essential in bridging the gap between employees and customers.

Innovation has proven to be a necessary tool to excel. The heavy-weight partnership between Accenture and Thales shows that combining success with technology aids in delivering a value-based service, improving the customer and client experience from beginning-to-end.

Armed Forces Day, on the 29th of June, is a chance for everyone in the UK to show support for the men and women who make up the Armed Forces community: from currently serving troops, to service families, veterans and reservists. Showing support for the Armed Forces provides a much valued morale boost for the troops and their families.

Representatives of the Thales UK Armed Forces Community 2019 at Green Park including both veterans and reservists

At Thales in the UK, we employ nearly 400 military veterans and 70 currently serving reservists across 10 sites. Additionally, over 70 Thales employees act as adult Combined Cadet Force (CCF) instructors in their spare time. We are proud to employ ex-service personnel and to support external events that highlight the value of veterans in the workplace.

“Thales knows that veterans can mean good business – ex forces are trained and skilled to the highest level, and companies like Thales are lucky enough to benefit from this huge pool of talent. It makes good business sense to build comprehensive and effective wellbeing programmes to support and retain this group of outstanding professionals.” Mike Seabrook, Company Secretary, Thales in the UK

Since 2014, Thales has sponsored the ‘Military Mind Business Symposium’, organised by Combat Stress, which is the leading veterans’ mental health charity in the UK. This year’s Military Mind Business Symposium, was held in April and focused on the mental health treatment and support available to veterans in employment, exploring practical ways companies can ensure wellbeing in the workplace.

Experts in the field of military mental health, as well as those in the corporate sector who employ veterans, joined clinical specialists from Combat Stress to discuss the opportunities and challenges for businesses with employees who have served in the Armed Forces.

Robbie Ross

Armoured Training Subject Matter Expert, Robbie Ross, has represented Thales at the last two Combat Stress Military Minds Symposiums speaking to the delegates about the cross over from military to civilian life and the impact on mental health from a veteran’s perspective. Robbie served as a ‘tankie’ in the British Army for 27 years, first with the Royal Tank Regiment and later with the Royal Dragoon Guards. Robbie is also one of Thales’ dedicated Mental Health First Aiders.

Thales has a heritage of supporting the Armed Forces for over 100 years, and is rightly proud of their commitment to supporting defence as well as many defence charities including the recently launched RAF Benevolent Fund’s Centenary Campaign where we sit on the Advisory Board. The aim of this campaign is to double the number of beneficiaries the Fund supports to 100,000, by 2021. To help achieve this, the campaign is asking the public, as well as the wider RAF community and industry stakeholders, to help find those who have fallen off the radar but urgently need help.

Thales is supporting this by urging everyone to visit www.rafbf.org or call 0300 102 1919 if you know of any RAF veterans or their families who may need support.

As an early signatory of the Armed Forces Corporate Covenant, Thales has also made a public commitment to supporting not just defence as a customer, but the Armed Forces community as an important part of our society. Thales wholeheartedly advocates that providing support to the Armed Forces community is commercially sound.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.7136774659156799}",neutral,0.7136774659156799,0

Newly-launched Russian telecom satellite relying on backup thrusters – Spaceflight Now - Spaceflight Now,"Mon, 10 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VmbGlnaHRub3cuY29tLzIwMTkvMDYvMTAvbmV3bHktbGF1bmNoZWQtcnVzc2lhbi10ZWxlY29tLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS1yZWx5aW5nLW9uLWJhY2t1cC10aHJ1c3RlcnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"A French-built communications satellite for Russia’s Gazprom Space Systems launched May 30 is maneuvering toward its final operating location in geostationary orbit using a set of backup thrusters after the spacecraft encountered a problem with its main engine.

Ground controllers planned a series of burns using the Yamal 601 satellite’s main engine to send the craft into geostationary orbit more than 22,000 miles (nearly 36,000 kilometers) above the equator, where its speed will match the rate of Earth’s rotation, giving Yamal 601 a constant coverage zone over Russia, the Middle East and parts of Southeast Asia.

But a main engine burn June 1 was cut short when the Yamal 601 satellite’s pointing, or attitude, drifted away from expected parameters, according to Gazprom Space Systems, a subsidiary of the Russian oil giant. The spacecraft went into safe mode, but all other systems on Yamal 601 remained healthy, officials said.

Gazprom Space Systems said the problem was presumably caused by a deviation in the thrust vector from Yamal 601’s primary orbit-raising engine, which was built in Germany by ArianeGroup. Thales Alenia Space of France, the prime contractor for the Yamal 601 spacecraft, determined the satellite’s lower-thrust rocket engines could be used for orbit-raising.

With a fully fueled weight around 11,900 pounds (5,400 kilograms), Yamal 601 satellite successfully launched aboard a Russian Proton rocket May 30 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The Proton’s Breeze M upper stage delivered the spacecraft into an on-target elliptical orbit, with a high point near geostationary altitude more than 22,000 miles above Earth, and a low point roughly 4,000 miles (6,400 kilometers) in altitude.

It was up to Yamal 601’s own propulsion system to finish the job of reaching geostationary orbit.

The S400 main engine aboard Yamal 601 produces around 90 pounds of thrust, while the satellite’s smaller control jets generate approximately 2 pounds of thrust. By burning the smaller thrusters for longer durations, Yamal 601 can reach its intended orbit by early July, Gazprom said in a statement.

Despite the main engine issue, Yamal 601 is still expected to complete its planned 15-year mission for Gazprom, according to Thales Alenia Space, which assembled the satellite at its facility in Cannes, France.

The first orbit-raising maneuver using the backup mode was completed June 6, Gazprom said.

Yamal 601’s C-band payload, which consists of 18 transponders, will replace coverage previous supplied by the Yamal 202 satellite launched in 2003. The C-band transponders will cover Russia, neighboring countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, the Middle East, and part of Southeast Asia.

According to Thales Alenia Space, a Ka-band payload on-board Yamal 601 will expand Gazprom’s coverage, with 32 spot beams over Western Russia and West Siberia to provide high-speed broadband connectivity to companies, regional governments, and individual consumers.

Gazprom Space Systems provides communications capacity for the Russian government, Russian television broadcasters and other commercial customers.

Once in position at an operating location in gestationary orbit at 49 degrees east longitude, Yamal 601 will replace the aging Yamal 202 communications satellite launched in 2003.

10 SHARES

Posted: 18 June 2019 | Intelligent Transport |

Thales is to provide its Communications Based Train Control (CBTC) system for the city of Ottawa’s east and west Stage 2 LRT project.

The Stage 2 Confederation Line extension will expand the initial 13 station Stage 1 Confederation Line farther east and west. The Stage 2 Confederation Line will extend east to Trim Road and west to Baseline Road and Moodie Drive, adding 28km of rail, 16 stations and a maintenance and storage facility. Following completion of the Stage 2 extension, the Confederation Line will consist of 29 stations spanning a distance of 40km providing more Ottawa residents with fast, efficient, clean and reliable light rail service.

Thales’s contribution to the Stage 2 O-Train extension project consists of integrating control units on-board each train, the installation of guideway equipment, including zone controllers, as well as commissioning the system to be safely integrated within Stage 1 operations.

Thales’s SelTrac™ Communications Based Train Control system is used on the O-Train’s Stage 1 transportation solution, which is designed to meet Ottawa’s transit challenges with a system that integrates surrounding communities with existing cycling and pedestrian paths and roadways. It is this familiarity with the O-Train system, its operation and technology, and in particular the Light Rail Vehicles being used, that Thales considers minimises integration risks and commissioning time in the Stage 2 extension.

“The Stage 2 O-Train Confederation Line Extension project allows Thales to continue to play an important role in providing a world-class transit system to Canada’s national capital,” commented Dominique Gaiardo, Vice President and Managing Director for Thales’s urban rail signalling business.

“Continuing our work from Stage 1, our local, made-in-Ontario SelTrac™ CBTC technology is a key part of the O-Train system, bringing to life the next important phase of Ottawa’s long-term transit vision, providing passengers a faster, safer and greener way to commute.”

Stage 2 LRT

Stage 2 LRT is a transformative project that will expand the O-Train by 44 kilometres to the south, east and west, and add 24 new stations. The expansions are expected to be completed in 2022, 2024 and 2025 respectively.

On 6 March 2019, Ottawa City Council approved EWC to design, build and finance the Stage 2 Confederation Line East and West extensions and TransitNEXT to design, build, finance and maintain the Stage 2 Trillium Line South extension.

When complete, Stage 2 will bring 77 per cent of Ottawa residents within five kilometres of fast, efficient, clean and reliable rail. The Stage 2 O-Train network will result in a fully grade-separated system that spans nearly 64 kilometres to include 41 stations, 85 vehicles and three maintenance and storage facilities. The total project cost is expected at $4.6 billion.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9992732405662537}",neutral,0.9992732405662537,0

North-west of Altaga, in the middle of the Sahara desert, terrorist attacks have been increasing in frequency in recent weeks. The terrorists appear from nowhere in pickup trucks fitted with large-calibre weapons, wreak havoc and disappear as quickly as they arrived.

Advancing in the searing heat, a convoy of regular army vehicles participating in Operation Bald Eagle disturbs the deceptive calm of the desert. The convoy is moving swiftly and purposefully, indicating that this is no routine patrol.

The search is on for armed terrorists in pickup trucks, who have been spotted in an area of a few dozen square miles. At the head of the column, Lieutenant Céline, 29, is coordinating the actions of the various vehicles in the convoy.

With eight armoured fighting vehicles under her command, Céline has what it takes to respond to a major attack. But first, her group needs to track down the terrorist groups and stop them communicating. Three other vehicles in the convoy are equipped with Thales communications electronic warfare systems: one for direction-finding and listening to messages sent and received by terrorists, the other two for jamming the signals.

Seek and disrupt

The goal of communications electronic warfare is to intercept electromagnetic emissions from hostile sources in order to identify the forces in the field, determine their exact position, and disrupt their operations by jamming their signals. To meet this strategic need, Thales has developed a suite of systems known as the Tactical Electronic Warfare System (TEWS).

TEWS is a comprehensive solution based on:

Sensors including interceptors/direction finders to detect, identify and locate hostile forces, and jammers to disrupt their communications

including interceptors/direction finders to detect, identify and locate hostile forces, and jammers to disrupt their communications A software suite based on KEYOBS , with an automated graphical interface to help users exploit the data

, with an automated graphical interface to help users exploit the data Communication systems to transfer data between vehicles. Thales's unique expertise in all these areas gives armed forces the flexibility they need at the same time as automating key parts of the information sharing process.

Specialist vehicles

With the TEWS, Thales can provide different types of electronic warfare vehicles equipped for specific missions.

Vehicles equipped with direction finders positioned on higher ground use a deployable antenna to capture signals in the surrounding area. The direction of a signal can be determined whether the source is stationary or on the move.

Jamming vehicles launch electromagnetic attacks as appropriate to isolate hostile forces by denying them access to communications.

launch electromagnetic attacks as appropriate to isolate hostile forces by denying them access to communications. The C2 (Command & Control) vehicle controls the mission and adapts manoeuvres as the situation unfolds.

To ensure each operation is as efficient as possible, mission preparation is vital. TEWS software based on the KEYOBS suite TEWS can determine in advance where direction-finding and jamming vehicles will need to be positioned to optimise signal capture and jamming. This simulation function reproduces the local topography and calculates the effect of terrain features on the operational scenario.

The element of surprise

In Lieutenant Céline’s convoy, the direction-finding and eavesdropping vehicle has picked up signals that appear to indicate two groups of terrorists in vehicles straight ahead.

To confirm the number of adversaries involved, and how heavily they are armed, the commander needs visual confirmation: she requests air support, and provides rear commanders with the location of the detected groups.

Shortly afterwards, an UAV taking part in Operation Bald Eagle flies discreetly over the desert, capturing the enemy force on video as it heads north. There are two groups of three pickup trucks, all armed with machine guns, located a few hundred metres apart. The enemy position has been located with a high degree of precision: the terrorists are within striking distance.

Lieutenant Céline decides to deploy jamming systems. The two dedicated vehicles are in position within minutes. The jamming operation is configured using the information already detected, and, all of a sudden, communications in the area are compromised.

At the same time, the young officer launches an assault by the unit’s armoured vehicles. Time is of the essence. Minutes later, the vehicles have the enemy in the sights of their 20-millimetre guns. Unable to match the unit’s firepower and armour, the terrorists quickly lay down their weapons.

The element of surprise was key: the terrorists had attempted to contact their commanders to receive orders and call for reinforcements, but all in vain. The soldiers on Operation Bald Eagle apprehend the fighters and take an inventory of their weapons.

All the information gathered on the mission, and the details of the signals intercepted during the operation, will now be analysed and exploited in the databases maintained by the armed forces intelligence services.

Thales Electronic Warfare Systems complement other assets — electronic warfare systems, manned aircraft and increasingly UAVs — to support armed units in their decisive moments, prepare their missions, increase their chances of success and reduce the risks for soldiers.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999325275421143}",neutral,0.9999325275421143,0
Interview: Will electrical propulsion be disruptive? - rolandberger.com,"Wed, 05 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJvbGFuZGJlcmdlci5jb20vZW4vSW5zaWdodHMvUHVibGljYXRpb25zL0ludGVydmlldy1XaWxsLWVsZWN0cmljYWwtcHJvcHVsc2lvbi1iZS1kaXNydXB0aXZlLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Roland Berger: How do you define disruption?

Thales Teixeira: Disruption is a term that is possibly over-used, and one that different people understand very differently. Purely theoretically, and in terms of how I use the term, disruption is defined as when the incumbents in an industry lose significant market share in a short space of time to newcomers. Now ""significant"" market share loss could be anything from 10-40%, or more. A short space of time could be anything up to a decade, but it really depends on the industry.

Another important thing to get right is that technologies do not cause disruption, for the most part – changing customer behaviour does. This can happen due to a variety of reasons, and can be spurred on by a new technology, for sure – but until customers change their behaviour and decide to adopt it, there will be no disruption.

Roland Berger: Will electrification cause disruption in aerospace?

Thales Teixeira: Probably not. As history has shown, changes such as electrification are platform changes, impacting many different aspects of society. Due to the number of stakeholders involved, such as producers, users, distributors, regulators, these changes will occur slowly. These are not disruptive changes by nature – typically in these situations, big companies are able to adapt and maintain most of their market share.

Disruption in aerospace is hard and electrical propulsion may require system level changes. This is different from technological innovation that can be adopted easily without the system changing. As electric aircraft become available, a slow adoption can be expected, with a long period of co-existence: aircraft with both electrical and conventional tech being used together.

Roland Berger: Does the same go for Tesla in the automotive industry, a company often touted to be disruptive?

Thales Teixeira: Tesla’s product is not disruptive; its business model might be. All the major auto companies have been working on electric vehicles. Tesla’s market share is tiny, though its market cap may be big due to inflated investor expectations. It’s impactful, but it is not disruptive – large companies are not losing significant market share due to Tesla yet.

Admittedly, within its niche market (high end, luxury, and electric), Tesla is very impactful. This is very much due to its innovative sales model (online and in shopping malls) and its service model (remote and wireless). But there remains the question whether they will threaten the market shares of the bigger market players.

Roland Berger: Which companies do come to mind when you think of disruption in the auto industry?

Thales Teixeira: Uber has been incredibly disruptive, and the reason is because consumer behaviour has changed dramatically. They started asking the fundamental question of what consumers really value when it comes to transport, rather than just trying to upgrade the existing privately-owned passanger car eco-system.

So, it wasn't just their technology that disrupted the market – it was the consumers behaviour and spending changing quickly. In fact, around the time of its launch in 2008, Uber had no innovative technology that was not available to other businesses “off the shelf.” Start-ups happen to be good at adapting faster to consumer needs and thus often become disruptors.

Roland Berger: How could electrification end up being disruptive?

Thales Teixeira: If somehow carbon dioxide emissions become a top priority for consumers, then this could cause a disruption. We are starting to see changes, but in truth low emissions are not anywhere near a top priority for most consumers.

Conversely, something that consumers really care about is cost reduction – monetary cost, time cost, effort cost. A business that can reduce one or more of these costs suddenly becomes very attractive, put simply. Amazon, for instance, has been ruthlessly reducing these three consumer costs in all industries it has entered. That is what it means to be customer-centric, its not about being nice to your customers. If electrical propulsion can do that, by making the commute cheaper, quicker or easier for passengers, it could be prove to be extremely disruptive.

Roland Berger: Could Urban Air Mobility/the 'flying car' phenomenon become disruptive?

Thales Teixeira: Currently, automobiles are relatively cheap per mile driven and fairly convenient, but the time cost has been increasing due to traffic in large cities. Between cities, commercial airplanes are fast, but the total time cost to go to airports and board flights makes it only a viable option for larger distances. There is an opportunity gap for either within-city or city-to-city air travel for distances up to 100 miles or so that bypasses airports. There are currently a myriad of R&D efforts going into small urban passenger air transportation that can fill this void. We do not yet know which product-technology combination will win out and get mass adoption. Based on looking at other industries, what we do know is the winning solution will have the best monetary-time-effort cost combination for customers, being “cheaper,” on the aggregate, than cars or planes for a certain use case.

Royal Navy adopts new mission control system that lets sailors work alongside “drone” mine hunters - Thales,"Thu, 13 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGFsZXNncm91cC5jb20vZW4vdW5pdGVkLWtpbmdkb20vbmV3cy9yb3lhbC1uYXZ5LWFkb3B0cy1uZXctbWlzc2lvbi1jb250cm9sLXN5c3RlbS1sZXRzLXNhaWxvcnMtd29yay1hbG9uZ3NpZGUtZHJvbmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In 1893 Hiram Maxim, inventor of the machine gun, predicted that his new weapon would make future war unthinkable.

History is littered with inaccurate predictions, especially where new technology is concerned. For Defence planners, technological advancement is one more factor to anticipate on top of which threats are emerging from shifting economic and political environments.

Artificial intelligence, autonomous systems, even human enhancement are here today and in less than a decade could be accessible to non-state adversaries, wiping out the battlefield advantages traditionally enjoyed by advanced nations.

From the invention of steam to the advent of air power, naval history shows that failure to keep up makes you a sitting duck. The UK Government recognised this challenge in its 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review and in the maritime environment, always a testbed for innovation, change is already occurring.

Most visibly, new platforms are being designed and built: two new aircraft carriers; the Type 26 and Type 31 frigate, Astute Class submarines and the nuclear deterrent replacement platform. Less obvious are the new domains and technologies the Royal Navy is beginning to exploit, including autonomy, artificial intelligence and cyberwarfare.

However, the Navy also possesses a large number of vessels which must be maintained and modernised alongside new platforms as a deterrent and to preserve force resilience in the event of conflict. But how can these older platforms, designed in a different century, be usefully integrated with emerging technologies?

Mine Countermeasures and autonomy

© Open Government Licence Royal Navy Sandown class mine countermeasure vessel

The Royal Navy is a world leader in mine hunting operations. Her flotilla of 13 highly capable Hunt and Sandown class mine countermeasures vessels (MCMVs) and their well-trained crews are employed globally to make shipping lanes safer from mines, either the legacy of past conflict or the product of new ones. However, they could soon become obsolete as maritime autonomy technology is developed to make their intrinsically dangerous work safer.

Global defence and transport equipment developer Thales enjoys a long and successful partnership with the Royal Navy. They provide all the Navy’s sonar sensors, including the 2093 variable depth and 2193 hull mounted sonars used on her MCMVs.

Thales is also a key player in the ongoing Anglo-French Maritime Mine Countermeasures (MMCM) programme. Its aim is to replace the sailor in the minefield with a new generation of unmanned surface and underwater vessels carrying specialist mine hunting payloads.

At the heart of MMCM is M-Cube, Thales’s command and control (C2) system for coordinating deployed autonomous elements, collating and processing data for operator.

M-Cube and hybrid operations

Tried and tested, M-Cube is the most widely fitted MCM combat mission system (CMS) in the world, in service with the Lithuanian, Estonian and Thai navies with a derivative used by an undisclosed Asian customer.

M-Cube is based on Thales’s Tacticos-based CMS architecture, providing a bridging technology to enable hybrid mine countermeasures operations in which conventional MCMVs work in collaboration with USVs and UUVs.

The current CMS used in the Hunt and Sandown MCMVs is a product of its time, a large-scale, self-contained IT programme, never designed to integrate with other systems, and is expensive to update. This equipment has become obsolescent and no longer meets Royal Navy needs for the MCMVs’ remaining service life.

But as the Royal Navy moves forward with MHC, its future mine countermeasures and hydrography capabilities programme which will come out of MMCM, what was needed was something more akin to the smart phone concept; a phone leaves the factory with a standard operating system and suite of apps but the user can customise with extra functions and update when necessary, rather than replacing the phone.

ORCA

In 2018 the Royal Navy put to tender ORCA, the Oceanographic Reconnaissance Combat Architecture programme. Its goal was to address the obsolescence of its MCMV CMS to extend the service lives of the Hunt and Sandown vessels into the 2030s.

The Navy was looking for a new C2 system to bridge the gap between current mine hunting capabilities and the digital and autonomous technology being trialled in MMCM. The solution would require a flexibility and capacity to adapt swiftly and Thales beat international and domestic competition with M-Cube. Thales provides much of the Navy’s sensor requirements but ORCA represents a breakthrough in providing a C2 system for the first time.

“This contract is a ground breaker for the Royal Navy and for Thales UK,” said Thales’s bid capture leader Stuart Robinson. “It represents the Navy’s ability to transition to new technologies with new partners. It also showcases to the global market what we can do in the UK to develop off-board maritime systems that bridge current capabilities to future ones.

“M-Cube represents new capabilities and much more functionality in terms of the information it can display to operators and its contribution to decision making. It’s a significant uplift on what they currently have.”

Unlike its predecessor, M-Cube uses an open software architecture. A component-based approach allows rapid insertion of new capabilities by “third parties”, potentially via mission specific Apps to introduce new technologies, including maritime autonomy.

M-Cube can also integrate stand-alone operations room systems such as MTSS (Mine Warfare Tactical Support System), used for MCM planning and data analysis.

Although platform specific interfaces can be introduced and there is variation in screen configuration to accommodate different Operations Room layouts, the same core M-Cube solution will be used on both classes of vessel, facilitating commonality of training and upgrade delivery.

The contract for ORCA contract, which was signed in February 2019, includes training for Royal Navy personnel, a five-year in-service support plan and, for the first time for MCMVs, a land-based test site to develop future technologies and algorithms ashore. The Navy aims to have the first of Class ship to be fitted and M-Cube accepted into service early next year.

“The MOD as the customer wants a quick flash to bang on this,” said Stuart, “But M-Cube is essentially out-of-the-box hardware and software already in service elsewhere in the world. It’s relatively low risk and we wouldn’t have signed up to this if we didn’t think we could deliver within the timescale.”

Thales in the UK's Autonomous Surface Vehicle 'Halcyon'

An autonomous future

The strategic impact of winning the ORCA contract on both UK domestic and export markets is a significant success for Thales with interest growing in Europe and the Middle East.

ORCA also represents the Royal Navy’s traditional readiness to adopt new thinking to maintain its position as a leading global maritime force.

Simon Thomas, ORCA Chief Engineer at Thales, said: “The ORCA infrastructure should provide the backbone of the MHC CMS, allowing for system of system integration and the augmentation of traditional organic and future autonomous systems, enhancing the current capability whilst simultaneously exposing the user to the future of autonomous mine hunting in operational environments.

“The ORCA program is the first exposure the MOD will have to a different CMS provider and the ability for the RN to transition to a new system, along with a different approach to shared data, shared environments and 3rd party insertion (via app stores or other means) will inform the Type 31e program on what the art of the possible maybe in the future on a more complex warship.”

Most importantly, M-Cube empowers the Royal Navy to continue delivering on its front-line commitments with a modern, capable and open mine hunting system that will make the sailor’s job safer. The system’s wide use abroad also opens opportunities for more combined mine countermeasures operations with allies to beat an international problem.

Indeed, it can be hard to imagine how outlandish some of today’s more commonplace innovations might have seemed a decade ago.

Even now, replacing a PIN with a fingerprint sensor for payment card security might seem unusual, but biometric security could be the future of finance.

It could even reach into other industries – such is the hope of ex-Gemalto, now part of Thales’s newly created activity, Digital Identity and Security.

Thales acquired 3M’s Identity Management Business in 2017 to capitalise on the expanding biometrics market, which was then valued at US$14.4 billion. The applications are not limited to fingerprints either; facial and ocular recognition are viable alternatives.

The Greater China region represents a huge opportunity for this field. To leverage the company’s expansion and acquisition within the regional biometrics industry, Suzanne Tong-Li serves as the company’s Deputy CEO in China.

Part of her role is focused on further strengthening Thales’s standing in the biometrics industry, with governments in emerging markets, such as China. “I’m constantly challenged to stay in touch and develop our new business in the biometrics industry,” says Suzanne.

“With my PhD in AI, I find the use of biometrics solutions, in people’s daily lives and in the field of identification, to be eye-opening and exciting. I’m inspired by looking at how our past business has worked with the smart card in a revolutionary way, and how we’re now providing new ways of authentication with biometrics, letting users enjoy a seamless, convenient experience.”

Suzanne acknowledges the difficulties around leading the company into new markets and new technology, and that there are a lot of uncertainties and risks around such a move.

After all, she’s been with Gemalto, now Thales, for long enough now to have seen the capacity for transformation within the industry. Few things would have better imparted that lesson than the creation of Gemalto in 2006 with the Axalto-Gemplus merger, at a time when Suzanne had been with Gemplus for just a year.

“I was excited when these two companies merged together, because it represented the creation of a leader in digital security,” says Suzanne. “In Asia, the two companies complemented each other, particularly in the banking and payment space. Axalto provided the competitive and advanced smart card products while Gemplus supplied the important manufacturing bases – one in Singapore and one in China – and the banking card personalisation bureau.

“After the merger, I was asked to manage the banking and transportation business in Asia–Pacific. That lasted for seven years. With the team, we’ve achieved stellar results, having grown our revenue several times over and cementing the company’s leadership in Asia. We’ve also expanded our banking card footprint to Shanghai and added a few more personalisation service centres across Asia–Pacific.”

Throughout her time within the Group, Suzanne has held different positions, first as Senior Vice President for a year and a half; then, after the merger with Thales, she has served as Deputy CEO of Thales in China from April 2019.

In her new role, she manages business development and sales, industrial partnerships, government affairs and communication as a single team of all Thales’s activities in China.

In external representation of the company, Suzanne describes her duties as being “the ambassador of Thales in China”, promoting the brand to clients, partners and the market.

“To me, gaining recognition within segments where Thales wasn’t previously known is a great personal achievement,” she says. Suzanne takes the internal duties of her role equally seriously.

She adheres to a clear set of values in leading her team – positivity, curiosity, teamwork and communication, while also ensuring that she leads by example. It’s no doubt easy for Suzanne to take this supportive, collaborative approach with her team, given the pride she has in Thales’s diverse, skilled workforce.

Globally, Thales employs some 80,000 people from 68 countries with about 3,000 researchers and 28,000 engineers dedicated to R&D. Within China, Suzanne is particularly proud that female employees make up 52% of Thales workforce in the digital identity and security business, in an industry that’s typically male-dominated.

Even with everything that Suzanne and the company have accomplished, she doesn’t believe the evolution of this business will slow down, especially after Thales’ acquisition of Gemalto.

“In the past, our top customers were mostly mobile network operators and banks,” she says. “With the launch of the next generation of digital security, we expect to work with more government agencies, state-owned enterprises and automotive and consumer electronics makers. The goal is to transform them into our top customers, while continuing to grow our base.”

This activity’s transition from the smart card industry to digital has led to huge organic changes and acquisitions such as 3M Identity Management, as well as IoT company Cinterion and information security company SafeNet.

Suzanne hopes to continue exploration of areas such as biometrics and AI. Though the Chinese industry is seeing a rise in agile, fast-growing unicorns, Suzanne believes Thales can continue to navigate the market, stepping up its local presence and market share.

“Each working day is a new day for me,” she says. “We face new opportunities and challenges daily. My hope is to be able to spot major business opportunities when they arise and drive the team to win them.”

Thales: the facts Thales is a global organisation with operations on all continents serving five major markets, all of which are of vital importance for our societies: aerospace, space, defence and security, ground transportation, and digital security. Thales completed the acquisition of Gemalto in April 2019, which became one of Thales’s seven global divisions, named Digital Identity and Security (DIS). This combination creates a world-class leader with an unrivalled portfolio of digital identity and security solutions based on technologies such as biometry, data protection, and, more broadly, cybersecurity. Thales will thus provide a seamless response to customers, including critical infrastructure providers such as banks, telecom operators, government agencies, utilities and other industries as they step up to the challenges of identifying people and objects and keeping data secure. Among its clients in the digital security industry, it counts companies such as Samsung, Amazon Web Services and Peugeot Citroën, as well as government projects such as ePassport technology, security for digital government services and ID verification. Between 2003 and 2012, Thales delivered 25 million e-driver’s licences in India and has provided e-healthcare cards in China.

 General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems (GD-OTS) has been awarded a US$15 million contract for the prototype and process development of a 155mm XM1113 Rocket-Assisted Projectile Round.

 This new round can enable U.S. Field Artillery to fire to a range of 40 kilometres, providing unrivalled range and a 30% increase from the current US M549A1 round.

 Thales Australia and GD-OTS signed a partnering agreement at Land Forces 2018 which can offer the latest munitions solutions to the Australian Defence Force.

 GD-OTS is working with Thales Australia to expand the international Supply Chain enabling the U.S. Government to make the system available to additional customers.

Thales Australia welcomes the announcement that GD-OTS was awarded a US$15 million contract for the prototype and process development of a 155mm XM1113 Rocket-Assisted Projectile Round.

In 2018 Thales Australia became a part of the GD-OTS international supply chain enabling co-production and technology transfer for a variety of critical munitions products.

Thales is Australia’s leading defence exporter and a key part of the GD-OTS supply chain. This contract could lead to additional exports from Thales’s operations at the Benalla and Mulwala sites, potentially securing and increasing jobs and investment for Thales and its local supply chain.

This announcement builds on the partnership between Thales Australia and GD-OTS, strengthening Australia’s identified Sovereign Industrial Capability in munitions and small arms research, design, development and manufacture.

This agreement was enabled by the United States Government’s expanded definition of their National Technology and Industrial Base to include Australia.

The XM1113 RAP uses rocket technology to deliver greater thrust to the round, when compared to its predecessor, the legacy M549A1. This new round will enable current U.S. Field Artillery 155mm Systems to fire the XM1113 RAP to a range of 40 kilometres, a 30% increase from the M549A1. When fired from the US’s planned future Extended Range Artillery Cannon, the XM1113 will achieve ranges out to 70 kilometres.

“Thales is delighted to be associated with GD-OTS, and through our partnership to potentially offer and deliver a world-class capability to the Australian Defence Force. This announcement could lead to additional export opportunities, securing and increasing jobs and investment for Thales and our local supply chain.” Corry Roberts, Vice President Land, Thales Australia “The XM1113 RAP brings enhanced performance to the battlefield, increasing lethality and extending range for the cannon artillery warfighter.

We are proud to support the Army’s modernisation initiatives to provide overmatch capability to the warfighter; and look forward to meeting the operational needs of our international allies”. Jason Gaines, Vice President and General Manager of Munition Systems at General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems.

Thales in the UK organise nationwide indoor rowing challenge - British Rowing,"Tue, 25 Jun 2019 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaXRpc2hyb3dpbmcub3JnLzIwMTkvMDYvdGhhbGVzLXVrLW9yZ2FuaXNlLW5hdGlvbndpZGUtaW5kb29yLXJvd2luZy1jaGFsbGVuZ2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales in the UK organise nationwide indoor rowing challenge

Thales in the UK have organised an indoor rowing challenge to raise funds for their charity partner, the British Heart Foundation

Speaking to British Rowing, Richard Packer, Chief Engineer (Research, Technology & Innovation) at Thales in the UK, says that the company sees this not only as a fantastic opportunity to raise money for the British Heart Foundation, but also as a staff team-building exercise and a chance to raise the profile of both indoor and on-water rowing.

The challenge is planned to take place on 2 July, the day before Henley Royal Regatta starts.

Thales in the UK has 10 major sites, most of which are in towns and cities with rowing clubs. Currently, seven have signed up to participate, covering approximately 5,000 of Thales in the UK’s 6,500 employees: Belfast, Cheadle Heath, Crawley, Glasgow, London, Reading and Templecombe.

On the day, there will be two challenges for participants to get involved in – one to encourage people simply to get on the machine and row for as long as they like at whatever pace they like, and one for the more competitive participants:

Site challenge – the site that covers the greatest overall distance on the day.

Individual challenge – the fastest man and fastest woman over 2112m, the length of the Henley Royal Regatta course.

Across all participating sites, the goal is to cover 344 km in total – the distance from London to Paris in a straight line.

Across the sites there will also be a range of activities, including a talk in Reading from British Rowing Chair, Mark Davies on 27 June as a precursor to the challenge, and support from triple-Olympic gold medallist Andrew Triggs-Hodge. Event t-shirts will also be offered thanks to Rock the Boat, with all proceeds going to the BHF.
