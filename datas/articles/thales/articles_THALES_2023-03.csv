Thales Alenia Space, the joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), has won contracts from the European Space Agency (ESA) to supply a first batch of six small satellites with synthetic aperture radars (SAR) and one satellite based on optical technology for the Italian Earth observation constellation, IRIDE. This innovative new constellation, based on a number of different sensing instruments and technologies, will range from microwave radar imaging to optical sensors at various spatial resolutions and in different frequency ranges, thus becoming a pioneering space program in Earth Observation.

The contract for the six SAR satellites is worth €112 million and includes an option on a second group of four satellites, worth €75 million. The optical satellite contract is worth €30 million, and includes an option on an additional satellite for €19 million.

The satellites will be built in Italy under the responsibility of Thales Alenia Space with the contribution of the entire supply chain of SMEs in the space sector. It will provide valuable data not only to researchers studying the evolution of the environmental conditions of Italy but also to the Civil Protection and other Public administrations to counter hydrogeological instability and fires, protect coasts, monitor critical infrastructures, air quality and weather conditions. Finally, IRIDE will provide analytical data for the development of commercial applications by start-ups, small and medium-sized enterprises and industries in the geospatial sector.

Both the radar and optical satellites are built on the modular NIMBUS (New Italian Micro Bus) platform, weighing about 170 kilograms. Built by Thales Alenia Space, the high-performance NIMBUS can be produced rapidly and is designed for high-revisit and high-capacity constellations. The optical payload is being developed by the Italian companies Media Lario and TDS, specialized in the creation of instruments and electronics for space.

© Thales Alenia SpaceIRIDE is a government project funded by Italy’s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR), managed by ESA in conjunction with the Italian space agency ASI. Scheduled for completion by 2026, IRIDE features a hybrid constellation of different satellites with dedicated Earth observation sensors. This end to end system comprises a series of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite sub-constellations, ground infrastructures (downstream) and services dedicated to Italian public administration.

“I would like to thank the European and Italian space agencies for once again entrusting Thales Alenia Space competences and expertise,” said Massimo Comparini, Senior Executive Vice President, Observation, Exploration, and Navigation at Thales Alenia Space. “Building on our contributions to major Earth observation programs, we are now a key player in this ambitious new project, which entails the creation of a unique, innovative and entirely Italian constellation. We are delighted to be tackling a new challenge that paves the way for the development of new capabilities, especially the design and production of small and medium-sized satellites, which are key to the ‘New Space’ economy.”

“The European Space Agency is delighted for the signature of this contract” said Simonetta Cheli, Director of Earth Observation Programs at ESA and head of the ESRIN center in Frascati. “The Italian government has entrusted us with the task of implementing this particularly challenging and innovative program, and with the signature of this contract, in addition to those signed in the past weeks, we are close to the full definition of the IRIDE constellation and in line with the roadmap that will allow ESA to reach the first milestone of the program, scheduled for the end of March. This is a very important milestone, given that the program is largely financed by PNRR funds. Congratulations to the Thales Alenia Space team for this important contribution to the IRIDE system. We firmly believe that, by integrating national and European assets, the IRIDE system will make Italy more competitive than ever in the Earth Observation sector.”

These satellites also feature sophisticated operating modes to support high revisit rates, providing data that can be integrated with that from other existing or future programs and infrastructures, including COSMO-SkyMed Second Generation and Prisma, as well as Europe’s vast Copernicus Earth observation program."
Thales Stratobus to launch into stratosphere - Aerospace Testing International,"Thu, 09 Mar 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFlcm9zcGFjZXRlc3RpbmdpbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Ryb25lcy1haXItdGF4aXMvdGhhbGVzLXN0cmF0b2J1cy10by1sYXVuY2gtaW50by1zdHJhdG9zcGhlcmUuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Alenia Space has signed a €43 million contract that should finally see its Stratobus high altitude airship fly.

Stratobus is a 140m long non-rigid stratospheric airship inflated with helium that maintains its shape through internal pressure and uses an electric propulsion system. The aircraft is propelled by four electric motors and powered by more than 1,000 square meters of solar cells.

It has the capability to operate at altitudes of 18 to 20km (11 to 12 miles) and engineers believe it will be able to carry payloads of up to 250kg (550 lbs).

The high-altitude persistent airship was originally conceived to perform ISR (intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance), communications, environmental monitoring and navigation.

Stratobus has been in development since 2010 in France, during which time engineers have developed the airship’s envelope and flexible solar concentrator, envelope tear technology for safety aspects, and high-efficiency propulsion system. However, a full-scale demonstrator has yet to be flown and the version to be flown will also be of a reduced scale.

Startolaunch is one of several high altitude vehicles to be trialled as part of an EU-finded the EuroHAPS (High-Altitude Platform Systems) demonstration project.

EuroHAPS will also see flight testing of a Hybrid High Altitude Airship from Italian research agency CIRA, which is capable of generating extra lift with a wing airfoil; an Autonomous Stratospheric Balloon System from ESG and TAO consisting of a series of three altitude-controllable balloons.

Stratobus is now being developed by Thales Alenia Space a JV between Thales and Leonardo. Thales Alenia Space is also leading the consortium of companies working on EuroHAPS, which includes 21 partners and 18 subcontractors from 11 countries.

Interest in stratospheric operations have been ignited recently by reports of so-called Chinese spy balloons being sighted and downed in the USA.

According to Thales, the three platforms being developed are complementary and feature different operating times, capacity and operational restrictions. They will give Europe a broad spectrum of solutions to meet a variety of different requirements.

The platforms will test a range of missions, including lidar observation to detect and classify targets at sea or on land, and for the latter the ability to detect them in environments with vegetation cover. COMmunications intelligence (COMINT) and electronic intelligence (ELINT) missions will also be tested, as well as a meshed broadband communications network for air and land players.

“We would like to thank all the institutional investors contributing to this project for their confidence and support in making this demonstration a reality,” said Hervé Derrey, CEO of Thales Alenia Space. “It is undoubtedly one of the most ambitious demonstrations ever undertaken, and will make Europe a pioneer in this new aerospace segment.”"
University of Cincinnati signs research agreement with French company Thales - WVXU,"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd2eHUub3JnL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvMjAyMy0wMy0yMS91bml2ZXJzaXR5LWNpbmNpbm5hdGktcmVzZWFyY2gtYWdyZWVtZW50LWZyZW5jaC1jb21wYW55LXRoYWxlc9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"University of Cincinnati researchers have signed a five-year memorandum of understanding (MOU) with global tech company Thales (pronounced TAL-ess).

Thales has an office in Blue Ash and is looking for more Cincinnati space. It's known globally for its work in the aerospace, defense, transportation and security sectors.

The multi-year MOU will allow the two to collaborate in many areas. Two big ones are cybersecurity and artificial intelligence.

Artificial intelligence

Even back in 2012 in Professor Kelly Cohen's UC lab, students were working to make artificial intelligence more trustworthy. One of Cohen's students then, Nick Ernest, now works for Thales and the two of them helped ink the MOU agreement.

You may know Ernest from a 2016 story when his artificial intelligence beat Air Force and Navy pilots in a simulation at Wright Patterson Air Force Base.

RELATED: ChatGPT can help businesses with mundane tasks. Just don't put any trade secrets into the AI bot

He looks forward to the Thales-UC collaboration and creating a more reliable artificial intelligence.

U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks says the public must be able to trust any future AI systems.

Cohen says with more airworthy vehicles, many of the elements would need to be automated. ""That would be possible with trustworthy AI, the emphasis on 'trustworthiness,' "" he says. ""It allows us as humans to trust the machines.""

Andrew Higley/University of Cinc Technology College of Engineering and Applied Science (CEAS) graduate students pose at the Digital Futures building.

He explains the AI systems UC developed and Thales advanced are reliable because they are restricted to doing certain tasks and that ensures they are doing them well.

Cybersecurity

Tennessee State and Southeastern Louisiana are the most recent universities to be hit with cyberattacks. Cincinnati State was hacked in November 2022. The University of Cincinnati, like other schools, is taking steps to protect itself.

RELATED: Kids' information is more valuable than adults'. That's one reason schools are getting hacked

This MOU will help with cybersecurity says Vice President Chief Digital Officer Bharath Prabhakaran. ""They (Thales) have a whole vertical focus on cybersecurity and multiple tools and solutions. We'll need to explore some of those opportunities or we can leverage that to further strengthen our position,"" he says.

Prabhakaran adds with research and student data at risk, cyberbreaches is one of the things that keep him up at night.

"Interview: Thales CEO talks air supremacy, combat cloud and Middle East investments - Breaking Defense","Fri, 03 Mar 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vYnJlYWtpbmdkZWZlbnNlLmNvbS8yMDIzLzAzL2ludGVydmlldy10aGFsZXMtY2VvLXRhbGtzLWFpci1zdXByZW1hY3ktY29tYmF0LWNsb3VkLWFuZC1taWRkbGUtZWFzdC1pbnZlc3RtZW50cy_SAXxodHRwczovL2JyZWFraW5nZGVmZW5zZS5jb20vMjAyMy8wMy9pbnRlcnZpZXctdGhhbGVzLWNlby10YWxrcy1haXItc3VwcmVtYWN5LWNvbWJhdC1jbG91ZC1hbmQtbWlkZGxlLWVhc3QtaW52ZXN0bWVudHMvP2FtcD0x?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"IDEX 2023 — Once relegated to an assumption, gaining air superiority is back at the forefront of the minds of European strategic planners in the wake of the fighting in Ukraine, according to Patrice Caine, CEO of the French defense firm Thales.

“Earlier the air supremacy concept was not a priority for many countries, especially in Europe,” he told Breaking Defense while at IDEX 2023 in Abu Dhabi last week. “However, we have now discovered that protecting the air space is clearly of the utmost importance.”

That should translate, he said, in future opportunities for Thales not only in Europe, but in the Middle East where the company hopes to expand its business, even as countries make strict demands on local versus foreign production. Caine also discussed the challenges and strategies surrounding collaborative combat clouds – an essential ingredient in what American officials call Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2), and the future of warfare.

This interview was edited for length and clarity.

Breaking Defense: As the new era of warfare evolves, new concepts of air supremacy have emerged around the world and in Europe, in particular since the conflict started in Ukraine. How does Thales intend to contribute to the future of air supremacy in Europe?

Patrice Caine: Earlier the concept of air supremacy was not a priority in many countries, especially in Europe. However, we have now discovered that protecting the air space is clearly of the utmost importance. In this domain, Thales is one of the few companies in the world mastering two important parts of the air defense systems. The first is threat detection through cutting-edge radars… and second is command and control.

Once you’ve detected the threat, the issue becomes how to deal with it. Thales provides a full-spectrum to protect air space, from sensors to effectors, embracing whatever the system approach or the system layer to put all these information together.

In Europe, Thales has been making strides in air supremacy, especially as a key player in France and Italy on short and medium range air defense systems. This is the case in the Middle East as well, where Thales is called to help countries to deal with newly evolving threats related to drones or UAVs.

These kind of threats needs specific measures to be dealt with because the drones are usually smaller than aircraft and fly at a lower altitude. It is also harder for a radar to detect slow moving targets. But we have developed the right radar family to address this new type of threat.

The combat cloud concept is being developed to link all assets on land, sea air, cyber and even space. How do you view the combat cloud, and what is Thales developing in this aspect to take part in the collaborative combat cloud [market]?

The notion of collaborative combat is centered around how we share the data between platforms and between media — data coming from warships, satellites, and the troops on the ground. How and where do you compute this data? That’s why there is also this notion of edge computing. To avoid putting [all the] data in the cloud, you would need huge bandwidth to transmit the data in the same cloud. This can be quite a challenge in terms of bandwidth. It’s smarter to compute locally what needs to be computed locally and to share only what needs to be shared.

This technology needs an end-to-end connectivity to transmit the data in a highly secure mode. In the miliary world, there are not always available networks, so you need to bring your own network and that’s quite a difference. [To do that, we use] data analytics and AI, noting that artificial intelligence is embedded in almost all our products.

After the data is collected, the integrated Thales systems start to develop an algorithm, either for data analytics or for AI, for data processing.

Knowing that the Middle East is one of the major markets for Thales, what are the main focal points Thales concentrates on, and plans to in the future? And is Thales ready to transfer technology in accordance with Vision 2030 [mandates] in the region?

In fact, our strategy is fully aligned with Vision 2030 in KSA [Saudi Arabia] and Vision 2040 in UAE, and we have been operating in line with it for many years now. We are trusted technological partners to the countries in the region. Hence building on this, you will find that we implement the most advanced technologies locally in the countries in which we operate.

Thales really intends to continue to grow locally. The old business model was to export from France or other Western countries. But now, in line with the national visions, localization is an important priority. Our strategy is to grow skills and competencies in the Middle East and Gulf region, leveraging the technologies from our Western footprint.

Thales is a company that countries in the region can rely on to grow sovereignty and independence. To do so, we focus on growing local skills, local talent base and local intellectual property, IP.

As countries mature this notion of sovereignty, they really see that what is important is the real intellectual property that you develop in the country.

After the Covid-19 pandemic, business models have changed and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and war for talent have become more important in the sector. What do you think about the ESG and the war for talent in Europe and France? And how is Thales paving its path to find the required talent in France and in all other countries it is present in?

ESG has become an essential topic for all companies in the world and especially companies involved in the defense sector. So, a while ago, we looked at ourselves and tried to answer to this very simple question: how do our activities contribute to some key societal challenges?

We have identified three societal challenges: to make the world safer, greener, and more inclusive.

In terms of making the world safer, we are looking at the digital space. Thales is well identified as a defense player, but less well-known in the field of cybersecurity, as the market is immense. We have chosen our battle and we have become a world leader in data management and security, securing 19 out of the 20 most important banks in the world in terms of data management and encryption.

Regarding greener… Thales has developed solutions to optimize the flight trajectory of the plane [and cut down emissions].

Lastly, to make the world more inclusive, I’ll give you two examples of where we’re developing our strengths. First, we want to bring an identity to each and every person in the world. This may seem obvious to you and me – having an identity card or passport. This allows us to vote, drive, gives us access to social benefits and so on. However, a recent study from the IMF showed that one billion people on Earth do not have a firm method to establish their identity. They cannot prove who they are. Our Digital Identity and Security business has developed a system on behalf of governments in many countries, and this is a focus for us.

The second example is reducing the digital divide. We have seen this during the COVID crisis. We have to live, study, work and do almost everything from home. Without decent connectivity, it would be impossible to do anything. When you live in a city, it’s okay. However, those who live in the countryside are at a disadvantage. Unfortunately, reliance on fiber optics is not economically feasible for many remote places. The solution is to bring internet through space – through satellites. What we have launched recently is an advanced satellite that gives users a service similar to that which fiber optics would give them. This greatly reduces the digital divide and makes the world more inclusive."

Indra, a Spanish company coordinating the Future Combat Air System (FCAS), has joined hands with German-based FCMS and French-based Thales to initiate the next design phase of asuite of networked and distributed sensors, defensive aids, and attack systems.

France, Germany, and Spain, as participating nations in FCAS, have entrusted Indra as prime, along with FCMS and Thales as main partners, to develop the suite of sensors that will equip the New Generation Fighter (NGF) and Remote Carriers (RC) platforms.

The initiative aims to consolidate the definition and architecture of the suite of networked sensors and critical components/building blocks of the RF and optronics sensors for the NGF and different types of RCs.

In 2020, FMCS, Indra, and Thales were chosen to develop the suite of sensors for FCAS.

With a collaborative system architecture and services, the NSDAD suite will boost sensor contribution, situational awareness, firepower, and survivability. The kick-off of Phase 1B activities represents a milestone in FCMS, Indra, and Thales’ joint commitment to developing the innovative NSDAD vision for the future NGWS.

The development phase will start in 2028, supporting the NGWS initial operational capability (IOC) in 2040.

Indra bolstered its participation in the European Defence Programme (New Generation Weapon System/Future Combat Air System) by formally joining the project in the execution of the Joint Concept Study, launched by France and Germany in February 2019.

Indra signed a contractual amendment that positions the company as a contractor of the Joint Concept Study, along with the national coordinators of France (Dassault) and Germany (Airbus).

Dassault, Airbus, and partners won the Phase 1A contract for FCAS. A consortium of Dassault Aviation, Airbus, and other partners received the initial framework contract (Phase 1A) for developing a next-generation combat jet. The NGF is the core element of the FCAS.

Coincidentally, the UK, Japan, and Italy are all collaborating on their next-generation fighter jet with their Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP). The FCAS face stiff competition from GCAP as a subtle race begins, with the military triads working hard to procure the better of the next-generation fighter jets."
Thales Alenia Space wins EU airship demonstration contract - DatacenterDynamics,"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhdGFjZW50ZXJkeW5hbWljcy5jb20vZW4vbmV3cy90aGFsZXMtYWxlbmlhLXNwYWNlLXdpbnMtZXUtYWlyc2hpcC1kZW1vbnN0cmF0aW9uLWNvbnRyYWN0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The Thales/Leonardo joint venture has signed a €43 million ($45.7m) contract for the EuroHAPS demonstration project.

EuroHAPS aims to develop several stratospheric demonstrators for missions designed to improve intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and communications capabilities.

“We would like to thank all the institutional investors contributing to this project for their confidence and support in making this demonstration a reality,” said Hervé Derrey, CEO of Thales Alenia Space. “It is undoubtedly one of the most ambitious demonstrations ever undertaken, and will make Europe a pioneer in this new aerospace segment.”

The project will conduct flight demonstrations for three different stratospheric platforms:

A ‘reduced-scale’ Stratobus – a solar-powered high-altitude airship – from Thales Alenia Space.

A Hybrid High Altitude Airship (HHAA) from CIRA.

An Autonomous Stratospheric Balloon System (ASBaS) from ESG and TAO consisting of a series of three altitude-controllable balloons.

Thales Alenia Space said the three platforms were complementary, offering Europe a ‘broad spectrum’ of HAPS solutions to meet different requirements.

EuroHAPS was selected by the Euro Defence Fund last year and is working with six defense ministries (France, Italy, Spain, Germany, Hungary, and the Czech Republic), the European Commission, the French Sud regional authority, and the Canary Islands region.

Demonstration flights are planned in Sardinia, Italy, and Fuerteventura of the Canary Islands in 2024.

The project features 21 partners, and 18 subcontractors, from 11 countries, including CIRA, Elettronica, and Leonardo from Italy; ONERA and CEA from France; INTA from Spain; and ESG with TAO from Germany.

HAPS – whether they be airships, balloons, or fixed-wing drones – offer a way to provide connectivity to rural and unconnected areas without the upfront costs of cell towers or satellites or the need for specialist receivers.

The Stratobus platform will be a non-rigid helium airship. Thales Alenia Space said the full-sized platform will be around 140 meters in length, propelled by four electric motors, with more than 1,000 sqm of solar cells. It will operate at altitudes of 18-20 kilometers (11-12 miles) and carry payloads of 250 kilograms rated at five kilowatts.

Tao has developed a segmented airship platform known as the SkyDragon that will operate at altitudes of around 20 miles as well as a smaller, lower-altitude solar-powered airship known as Lotte.

Google/Alphabet's now-defunct high-altitude balloon unit Project Loon was probably the most famous HAPS project, but a number of companies are looking to develop a successful platform in the space. Other players include Airbus, SoftBank (via its HAPSMobile unit), Stratospheric Platforms, Avealto, and BAE.

This week SoftBank announced it has developed a new HAPS battery pack with Lithium-metal cells and conducted a successful demonstration in the stratosphere.

The battery pack was developed in partnership with ENAX Inc and used cells from Enpower Japan, offering 439Wh/kg of energy. The company conducted a charge-discharge cycle test of the battery pack in the stratosphere above the US between January 30 and February 2 with its HAPSMobile subsidiary."

Financing lined up for potential Idemia deal; Thales reportedly still interested - Biometric Update,"Thu, 09 Mar 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpb21ldHJpY3VwZGF0ZS5jb20vMjAyMzAzL2ZpbmFuY2luZy1saW5lZC11cC1mb3ItcG90ZW50aWFsLWlkZW1pYS1kZWFsLXRoYWxlcy1yZXBvcnRlZGx5LXN0aWxsLWludGVyZXN0ZWTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"It looks as if the private equity firm owning Idemia has teed up the biometrics and digital ID giant’s sale, arranging for a plain vanilla transaction in uncertain times.

According to confidential sources known only to financial news publisher Bloomberg, Advent International has hired U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs Group is arranging a preplanned €550 million (US$580 million) sale of Idemia.

Goldman Sachs is building a €2.5 billion (US$2.7 billion) debt-only financing structure, according to Bloomberg reporting.

Financial news service Private Equity Wire described the debt as high-yield bonds and leveraged loans, both reflecting perceived heavy indebtedness by Idemia or a greater risk of default.

In a staple, sometimes called pre-agreed, deal, the investment bank takes on a great deal of risk.

Not only is it spending resources on a deal that may not transpire, but it will need to find buyers for the debt created in the buyout, which is not a sure thing right now.

A sale of the France-based company so far has lured interest from biometrics player Thales and a pair of investment firms: Apollo Global Management and Brookfield Asset Management, Bloomberg says. Advent has held Idemia since 2017.

Debt raised would equal 4.5 times Idemia’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda. It has been more common recently to see deals like this pushed with a debt ratio of at least six percent.

Staple deals, as such structures are called, are completely orchestrated in advance. A would-be buyer knowns all the costs in advance, and while it is hard for a potential buyer to negotiate better terms for any facet of a buyout, it does not have to invest in building its own financing package.

One of the results is that more possible buyers come around kicking the target company’s tires.

Thales reportedly has been here before. According to Reuters reporting a year ago, Thales expressed interest in acquiring assets from Idemia in a sale that valued Idemia at €3 billion to €4 billion (at the time, US$3.4 billion to $4.6 billion).

Antitrust regulations would have limited which parts Thales could bid for. It had previously confirmed its interest in adding cybersecurity assets.

A hypothetical 2022 transaction would have been a typical facility, not a staple deal.

EuroHAPS was selected by the European Commission on July 20, 2022, for collaborative defense research and development projects from the European Defense Fund.

EuroHAPS aims to develop several stratospheric demonstrators for missions designed to improve intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and communications capabilities. Project partners include companies from Italy, Spain, Germany and France.

The project will conduct flight demonstrations for three types of complementary stratospheric platforms: A reduced-scale Stratobus from Thales Alenia Space, a solar-powered airship designed for long-endurance missions and offering large payload capacity, Hybrid High Altitude Airship from the Italian Aerospace Research Centre capable of generating extra lift with a wing airfoil, and autonomous stratospheric balloon system from ESG and TAO consisting of a series of three altitude-controllable balloons.

These three types of platforms are complementary and feature different operating times, capacity and operational restrictions. They will give Europe a broad spectrum of solutions to meet a variety of different requirements.

The platforms will test a range of missions, including lidar observation to detect and classify targets at sea or on land and the ability to detect them in environments with vegetation cover. Communications intelligence and electronic intelligence missions will also be tested, as well as a meshed broadband communications network for air and land players.

HAPS offer a new opportunity to complement ground-based, satellite-based or airborne assets with unique capabilities tailored to operational requirements. These flight demonstrations of HAPS will enable demonstrations of different platforms and address the main technical risks associated with these new technologies while refining operational requirements to ultimately enable development of future HAPS systems."

Exail and Thales partner on new quantum communications hardware

09 Mar 2023

French firms providing industrial expertise for rapid development of ready-to-deploy QKD systems in Europe.

Exail, the France-based technology company, is leading a new European-funded project hoping to develop ready-to-deploy quantum key distribution (QKD) systems for ultra-secure optical communications.

The Quantum Key Industrial SystemS (QKISS) project, which officially kicked off in January, also features defense giant Thales and is aiming to produce high-performance, secure and certifiable systems within three years.

Working alongside Exail and Thales will be two leading academic teams, from Université Paris-Saclay and Sorbonne Université.

Strategic autonomy

According to Exail, the European Commission’s Quantum Communication Infrastructure (EruoQCI) initiative is aiming to build a secure quantum communication infrastructure spanning the entire European Union, including overseas territories.

However, at the moment Europe lacks the kind of established QKD hardware providers that would be needed for total strategic autonomy.

In a bid to help solve that problem, the objective of the QKISS project is to implement a complete, qualified telecom link supporting encrypted communications developed by the French partnership.

Exail says that the effort encompasses manufacturing of opto-electronic components, development of specialized signal processing and coding algorithms, all the way up to full system integration, field demonstrations, and evidence of compatibility with telecom network systems.

The company, which was created last year by the merger of photonics-focused iXblue and industrial automation firm ECA Group, already provides key components for QKD in the form of single-frequency seed lasers, optical modulators, and variable optical attenuators, for both the transmit and receive side of QKD systems.

AliX and BeatriX

QKD systems designers typically refer to “Alice” and “Bob” as the sender and recipient of encrypted information, but QKISS will see a particularly Francophone take on those names. Baptiste Gouraud, R&D engineer and project manager at Exail, explained in a company announcement:

“In practice, QKISS will [result in] implementation of a laser-telecom link between a transmitter called “AliX” and a receiver called ”BeatriX” thanks to optical fibers.

“Using the same technique as in long-haul optical communications, information will be transmitted through coherent modulation of light: it will be encoded in the amplitude and phase of the electromagnetic field, but will be protected by the quantum detection noise.

“Coherent homodyne or heterodyne detection will be used to retrieve the quadrature value of the signal to read the key into it.”

CV-QKD focus

Philippe Grangier, head of the Quantum Optic Group at the Institut d’Optique, pointed out that the QKISS project would utilize continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD), building on two decades of academic research into the approach.

Unlike regular QKD, CV-QKD does not require costly low-temperature single-photon avalanche detectors (SPADs), with Grangier saying: “After tremendous progress over the years, involving both academic and industry partners, the technology is now mature enough for industrial deployment.”

Eleni Diamanti, CNRS Senior Researcher and team leader at Sorbonne’s LIP6 lab, added that QKISS would be able to build on recent QKD-related developments under EU-funded projects such as CiViQ, which included a number of Europe’s largest telecoms firms, as well as the German subsidiary of China’s Huawei.

The partners say that QKISS will target a low-cost but high-rate implementation, suitable for metropolitan use-cases at communication speeds with a modulation rate of hundreds of megabaud (MBd), and a secure key rate in the realm of megabits per second (Mbit/s).

“After an industrialization phase, QKISS systems will be available for deployment in the EuroQCI and applications relying on private communications: e-banking, e-health, government communication or the management and protection of critical infrastructure,” they predict."
How can artificial intelligence help build a greener future? - Thales,"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi93b3JsZHdpZGUvZ3JvdXAvbWFnYXppbmUvaG93LWNhbi1hcnRpZmljaWFsLWludGVsbGlnZW5jZS1oZWxwLWJ1aWxkLWdyZWVuZXItZnV0dXJl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"How can artificial intelligence help build a greener future? Artificial intelligence corporate responsibility Share this article

Over the past decades, artificial intelligence (AI) has gone from being something out of science fiction to being very much part of science fact. It is now an integral part of our present, and we are beginning to see the impact it has on the workplace, the economy and the technology we use every day. But what about its impact on the environment? How can we leverage AI to build a greener and more sustainable future?

AI has long been a favourite subject in fiction, be it books, graphic novels or films – think 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Matrix or even The Terminator. In the interests of drama and suspense, the AI portrayed is more often than not malevolent, with machines having half an eye on taking over the world (or in the case of The Matrix, the machine actually being the world).

Although the AI was fictional, the fears expressed were very real. In 1961, Life magazine published an article entitled “The Machine Are Taking Over: Computers Outdo Man At His Work – And Soon May Outthink Him”, which described machines that were capable not only of performing analytical and decision-making tasks in business and industry, but also of learning by themselves.

Fast forward to 2023, and those machines are now hard at work among us. However, far from being the threat to the existence of humanity that they were seen to be 60 years ago, they now make an invaluable contribution to our day-to-day lives. So where exactly can AI make a contribution to environmental issues?

We take a look at six fields in which artificial intelligence can have a direct and positive impact on the environment.

Clearer skies

Thales’s PureFlyt flight management system is a prime example of what can be done. It uses AI to optimise aircraft trajectories and thus reduce both fuel consumption and noise pollution, with the objective of a 10% reduction in aircraft CO2 emissions by 2023. Flight tests also used AI to simulate some two billion scenarios and clock up the equivalent of 100 million flight hours.

In addition, research is being done on how to use those AI-assisted trajectories to reduce the environmental impact of aircraft contrails by having planes fly at a slightly lower altitude, as well as to have planes make a continuous descent to landing, as opposed to descending by levels. Both of these measures could help reduce fuel consumption and air pollution.

AI is also having a positive impact on air traffic management, which will have to cope not only with traditional aircraft, but also with a rise in the number of unmanned aerial vehicles in the skies. Instead of AI replacing human beings, Thales believes that it will enhance their capabilities by freeing them from repetitive, low-value tasks and enabling them to focus on more critical areas where human intervention is vital.

This human-centric focus will create safer and more efficient airspace management; in addition, the advanced predictive capabilities of AI will lead to fewer delays in the air and on the ground, which in turn means less fuel burned and a reduced carbon footprint for the airline industry.

Climate monitoring

AI also has a vital role to play in the observation and understanding of climate phenomena, which are key to combating climate change. Its most obvious application is in increasing the image processing capabilities of satellites, which will be able to better analyse and predict climate phenomena.

Thales is contributing to this effort, for example, within the framework of Europe's Copernicus Earth observation and climate monitoring programme, which will help better understand the environmental impact of human activity.

Green mobility

However, it’s not just in and above the skies where AI is making a significant contribution to environmental issues. Thales has also developed complex, eco-responsible systems for rail transportation that leverage AI based on learning and knowledge, and consume less energy.

Driver advisory and traffic management systems, along with systems to manage the automatic operation of both metros and autonomous trains, optimise energy consumption through carefully defined driving strategies, and by calculating optimal acceleration and braking profiles in real time.

These systems also enable incidents on the network to be anticipated, thus reducing unexpected train stoppages caused by obstacles on the tracks, for example. Station supervision systems also analyse energy consumption in real time, with sensors that determine the precise energy needs according to passenger flows, ensuring that energy consumption matches requirements.

Energy consumption and the IoT

One of the areas where AI really comes into its own is in the face of what Gregor Pavlin, programme manager and senior scientist at Thales Research & Technology, calls “wicked data”. Modern systems, in the field of IoT (Internet of Things) for instance, collect huge amounts of all different kinds of data. Traditionally, that data is processed in a central computer or cloud, and then the results are sent back to the application in the field. However, not only does this raise security issues, but it is also neither cost- nor energy-efficient.

Thales’s expertise has enabled it to develop a platform for the simple integration of distributed AI algorithms in the field, which process most of the data close to the application – so-called edge computing – and only transfer the processing results, keeping the data behind a secure firewall and significantly reducing energy consumption.

Lateral thinking: eco-design and frugal AI

Sustainable technology, however, is not just about visible impacts, such as reducing energy consumption or carbon emissions. It also involves looking at entire processes – from conception to operation – to see where real change can occur. According to Pavlin: “We are also part of the shift towards more frugal, more sustainable technologies. Eco-design is a key principle in all our developments.”

As an expert in critical-decision support solutions, Thales is the first company to develop ""frugal"" AI based on algorithms that only require small amounts of energy. Thales researchers are prioritising knowledge-based symbolic or hybrid AI, which is far more energy efficient. Attention is being shifted from Big Data to Smart Data, favouring quality over quantity, and to improving electronics design and implementation to offer electronic circuits that consume very little energy.

The AI of the future: neuromorphic computing

What about the next big thing? Although it is still in its infancy, neuromorphic computing could be the technology that completely revolutionises AI.

Thales is at the forefront of research in this field, thanks to the pioneering work done by teams at the CNRS/Thales joint physics unit in Palaiseau. Director of Research Julie Grollier explains: “Most AI people today are concentrating on algorithms that help to achieve a particular outcome. AI algorithms may be inspired by the workings of the human brain and its neural networks, but they are based on virtual neural networks running on conventional computer chips.”

“A neuromorphic chip, on the other hand, is a physical reproduction of a neural network. In my work, we are taking inspiration from the organisation and structure of the brain — and in particular from the way neural networks are organised as successive layers of neurons in the cortex — to develop processors that can run these algorithms very efficiently and with much less energy.”

Thales Alenia Space to provide Vietnam with a search-and-rescue network – SatNews - SatNews,"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5zYXRuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDIzLzAzLzIxL3RoYWxlcy1hbGVuaWEtc3BhY2UtdG8tcHJvdmlkZS12aWV0bmFtLXdpdGgtYS1zZWFyY2gtYW5kLXJlc2N1ZS1uZXR3b3JrL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Alenia Space, the joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), has signed a contract with prime contractor MKE to provide Vietnam with a MEOLUT Next ground station that will operate as part of the COSPAS-SARSAT global MEOSAR (MEdium Orbit Search And Rescue) search-and-rescue (SAR) network.

The solution will make it possible to detect and locate distress signals from COSPAS-SARSAT beacons on land, in the air and at sea instantaneously over a radius of 2,500 km centered around Haiphong, mainly using the Galileo satellite positioning system.

Thales Alenia Space’s MEOLUT Next product, which employs a phased array antenna, will give Vietnam unrivaled performance. Where conventional MEOLUT systems rely on six, large, parabolic antennas each covering an area about the size of a football field and are therefore only capable of receiving signals from six satellites simultaneously (one per antenna), the MEOLUT Next solution, with its compact antennas taking up less than six square meters, tracks up to 30 satellites, significantly enhancing distress beacon detection and expanding coverage. MEOLUT Next is, therefore, capable of detecting and locating distress signals from more than 5,000 km away.

The solution is already operated by the main users of COSPAS-SARSAT (USA, Canada, France, the European Union, and Togo) and, more recently, by Thailand. The system is helping to save lives, as recently demonstrated in the Indian Ocean.

On November 18, 2022, a MEOLUT Next antenna picked up a distress signal from the Asteria, a yacht skippered by Tapio Lehtinen competing in the Golden Globe race, 2,000 km southwest of La Réunion, well outside the range of VHF radio and other communications systems. The Asteria was sinking fast, and Tapio just had time to put on his survival suit and jump into his liferaft before activating his COSPAR-SARSAT distress beacon. Within only four minutes, MEOLUT Next had pinpointed the boat’s location to guide rescue crews to the scene and save the skipper.

“This is the second contract to deploy our MEOLUT Next solution in Asia, following the one recently awarded in Thailand, a testament to the operational performance of this technology in ensuring the safety of people and property. Saving lives is something that ties in with our company’s aspirations, as demonstrated by our contribution to COSPAS-SARSAT search-and-rescue services.” Benoit Broudy, Vice President, Navigation at Thales Alenia Space in France

COSPAS-SARSAT is an intergovernmental organization founded by Canada, the United States, Russia and France. Operational since 1988 and deployed in more than 40 countries around the world, this satellite-based search-and-rescue distress alert detection and information distribution system is best known for detecting and locating emergency beacons activated by aircraft, ships and hikers in distress. Today, almost 1 million ships and 300,000 aircraft are equipped with COSPAS-SARSAT distress beacons. To date, the COSPAS-SARSAT service has saved more than 57,000 lives in more than 17,000 search-and-rescue events. In the last few years, COSPAS-SARSAT has helped save an average of seven lives every day. Learn more at https://www.cospas-sarsat.int/fr/

Conventional MEOLUT (Medium Earth Orbit Local User Terminal) systems use large parabolic antennas and are limited by how many satellite signals they can receive. Thales Alenia Space’s MEOLUT Next solution is compact, measuring less than six square meters, and is able to track up to 30 satellites, thus significantly enhancing distress beacon detection while expanding coverage. Since there are no mechanical components, hardware maintenance costs are the lowest on the market. Learn more

We read about it every day in the news – high-intensity conflict has well and truly returned to the world stage. With the latest edition of the SOFINS exhibition(1) taking place this month, we asked Thales's land defence advisor, General Bernard Barrera, to explain how the Group supports land forces, and special operations forces in particular, in accomplishing their missions today.

What can Thales do for special forces?

Our solutions meet a very broad spectrum of requirements. They range from command-and-control systems for forces deployed in contested environments to connectivity and communications, optronic equipments, weapon systems, simulation and unmanned robotics.

More broadly, we harness the latest digital technologies to provide special forces with innovative equipment that's both compact and interoperable. These are crucial considerations for front-line units, which need to stay connected with their command posts, and for forward observers who need the most lightweight, high-performance night vision equipment that technology can offer. All our solutions are designed to help them gain and maintain tactical superiority on the battlefield and to stay one step ahead of the adversary.

Current conflicts show just how important it is – for special forces in particular – to be able to rely on real-time data collection, analysis and transmission.

Military operations today are increasingly data-driven, and data also plays a vital role for special forces on the front lines. Thales provides them with optronic systems and other smart sensors for data collection, as well as a particularly innovative defence cloud solution for storing, analysing and sharing the data. The Thales defence cloud is a complete, modular, sovereign solution that keeps command centres in touch with the theatre of operations in real time.

Thales is also a leading expert in defence communications, which are clearly also of critical importance for special forces.

That's correct. Our connectivity solutions are designed to meet the specific requirements of special forces. In military satellite communications, for example, we have developed the Nexium Sat system, which provides special forces with end-to-end communications, protection from interference and jamming, guaranteed availability and quality of service, and the data rates they need to counter any type of threat.

Our tactical communication systems also provide secure, resilient connectivity for special forces. These include the new Synaps family of software-defined radios, the new-generation IMBITR (Improved Multi-Band Inter/ Intra Team Radio) – a dual-channel handheld radio purpose-designed for special forces – and a range of secure high-speed datalinks.

Equipment size and weight are also key considerations for special forces. How much progress have you made in this area?

The products we offer today are smaller, weigh less and consume less power than earlier generations. They offer the best response to the needs of special forces by reducing the physical and cognitive burden on the combatant.

All the systems I have mentioned here, and other equipment for mounted combat as well as dismounted combat – including weapons, high-performance multi-function thermal imagers with geolocation in GNSS -denied environments, training and simulation systems, drone countermeasures and cybersecurity solutions for command posts – are designed with the same aim in mind: providing special forces with the best equipment and the most innovative technologies so they can always stay a step ahead of the adversary and accomplish their critical missions in the field. That's our number one priority.

Everyone needs a hero and we are lucky to have our very own! Rob Jones, an engineer based at our Cheadle office, was recognised in the 2022 Made in Manchester awards for the incredible amount of charity work he has been doing in his hometown.

Growing up in a deprived area of North Manchester, Rob knows only too well how important it is to give young people from all walks of life exposure to the possibilities a career like engineering can open up.

Rob has worked as a STEM ambassador since 2011. Through Thales’ volunteering programme, he visits local schools, bringing STEM subjects to life by providing hands on experiences to teach young people the basics of systems engineering.

One of the many programmes Rob has been involved in is the Robotics Challenge which aims to introduce students to real world engineering, technology and computing challenges. He has been taken aback by the level of interest in engineering as a profession: “just giving kids exposure to a qualified engineer is a big deal as there aren’t many of us in North Manchester. Hopefully meeting people like me helps give them aspirations as they see that it’s not just a white, middle class profession, but something that’s open to anyone who likes fixing things.” Rob also volunteers with the Science and Industry Museum in Manchester and acts as a mentor to support members of the Institute of Engineering and Technology.

Rob’s passion for what he does outside of his day job is absolutely clear and he hopes to inspire other people to get involved:"

The dock's two main flooding valves have been in continuous operation for over 75 years, necessitating a removal and replacement operation for them both, starting with 'Valve 10.' This project was years in the making and is a feat that represents the skills and capability of the Garden Island Team.

The CCGD is, to put it mildly, gargantuan. At 350m long, 45 metres wide, with a 230-million-litre reservoir that can be drained at the rate of an Olympic pool every 40 seconds, there needs to be incredible power behind the flooding and draining of the dock.

The two primary powerhouses that propel this activity are the main flooding valves. They average about 600,000 litres per minute, per valve, over the docking filling cycle, enabling it to be safely flooded in about 2 ½ hours.

As the CCGD has been in continuous operation for over 70 years, the primary valves, installed in 1943 by Scottish company, Glenfield & Kennedy Pty Ltd, were due to be replaced. The project itself kicked off in 2018 with a scoping and feasibility study to assess the intricacies and logistics of the project including safety considerations and delivery strategy.

In 2019, the detailed design phase for the associated valve pit infrastructure commenced, as well as casting of the new valve and, in 2020, although the project was steadily progressing, unavoidable delays caused by Covid associated restrictions impacted the project for the next two years.

Fast forward to July 2022, when the team received word that the valve was headed to Sydney. They kicked-off planning for the delivery phase works to determine critical activities including: HSE requirements, obtaining consensus on the sequence of tasks around docking movements and developing and testing of the Thales bespoke double isolation system.

While all elements of the project had their importance, the valve replacement works wouldn’t have gone ahead without the implementation of the double isolation system that stopped the pit from flooding while the team completed the replacement. Essentially, the double isolation consists of an inflated plug in the valve pit culvert with the stop log gate behind it to seal it off from the harbour. In the past, it was only the stop log gate that was installed to prevent any water ingress.

The physical removal and replacement of ‘Valve 10’ took place over two days and went seamlessly, with the 20-person team pulling together to execute the activity safely, efficiently and expertly.

Valve 10 is one of the largest critical infrastructure components in the Captain Cook Graving Dock. For some time, the valve has been inoperable, limiting the flooding efficiency to the dock during docking movements. With new valve 10 installed, the dock will be returned to near full operational capacity and capability in Thales’ ongoing support to the Commonwealth’s Defence readiness.""

"Thales partners with IDScan.net to fight fake ID fraud, underage drinking - Biometric Update","Wed, 15 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpb21ldHJpY3VwZGF0ZS5jb20vMjAyMzAzL3RoYWxlcy1wYXJ0bmVycy13aXRoLWlkc2Nhbi1uZXQtdG8tZmlnaHQtZmFrZS1pZC1mcmF1ZC11bmRlcmFnZS1kcmlua2luZ9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"French conglomerate and identity technology giant Thales has joined forces with IDScan.net to develop products aimed at tackling fraud and offenses using fake ID, particularly concerning underage drinking in the U.S.

The partnership was unveiled by New Orleans-based IDScan.net, which says it will bring together Thales’s identity document scanners and its own VeriScan Authentication software to check IDs against hologram and watermark libraries.

At the time of writing, the firms have collaborated on two separate scanners based on the Thales CR5400 and AT10K models. The devices come with VeriScan already integrated and support ID verification features, as well as ID information parsing into a visitor management system to help security teams manage ban lists and prevent chargebacks.

From a hardware standpoint, the CR5400 and AT10K devices can perform UV/IR/white light scanning, as well as rapid six-image capture to ensure scanned IDs can be read correctly by VeriScan.

According to the firms, the age verification scanners aim to fill a technical gap created by the lack of identification technologies for fake ID, particularly in the light of many fake IDs being sophisticated and typically passing a visual inspection and barcode scan checks.

“Most bars and nightclubs think any scanning of an ID is catching fakes, but the reality is most ID scanning apps are just verifying age; they don’t catch any fake IDs at all,” comments IDScan.net CEO Terry Slattery. “Even companies with more sophisticated tech simply can’t do it without specialty hardware.”

The executive adds he believes the partnership with Thales will now contribute to the further adoption of the VeriScan software across North America, particularly in those states, including Nevada, unveiling legislation aimed at reducing underage drinking (and tobacco purchases).

“We’ve partnered with best-in-class hardware because we know how important fake ID detection and ID authentication is to our nightlife customers,” Slattery adds. “With Thales products, you know that the hardware can truly put an ID through its paces and do it very quickly.”

The collaboration with IDScan.net comes weeks after Thales announced passing an interoperability test for mobile driver’s licenses and digital identities in Australia.

Thales Alenia Space initiates EuroHAPS project - European Security & Defence,"Thu, 09 Mar 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vZXVyby1zZC5jb20vMjAyMy8wMy9uZXdzLzMwMTY0L3RoYWxlcy1hbGVuaWEtc3BhY2UtaW5pdGlhdGVzLWV1cm9oYXBzLXByb2plY3Qv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), announced the initiation of the European High-Altitude Platform Systems (EuroHAPS) project on 9 March 2023.

A demonstration project selected by the European Commission on 20 July 2022 after a call for collaborative defence research and development projects from the European Defense Fund (EDF), EuroHAPS has an estimated total cost of EUR 63.52 M but receives a maximum EU contribution of EUR 43 M. The expected duration of the project is 38 months.

Under the project Thales Alenia Space is co-ordinating a European consortium of 21 partners and 18 subcontractors, with the main partners being CIRA, Elettronica and Leonardo from Italy, ONERA and CEA from France, INTA from Spain, and ESG with TAO from Germany.

The project will deliver to the point of flight demonstrations three complementary stratospheric platforms. For the first of these Thales Alenia Space will lead the development of a reduced-scale version of its Stratobus concept: a solar-powered airship designed for long-endurance missions and offering a large payload capacity. Secondly, CIRA will lead the delivery of a Hybrid High Altitude Airship (HHAA, or tactical HAPS), which will be capable of generating extra lift using a wing airfoil. The third platform will be an Autonomous Stratospheric Balloon System (ASBaS) from ESG and TAO consisting of a series of three altitude-controllable balloons.

The idea of producing these three complementary platforms is to give EU countries a broad spectrum of solutions to meet a variety of different requirements.

“These platforms will test a range of missions, including lidar observation to detect and classify targets at sea or on land, and for the latter the ability to detect them in environments with vegetation cover,” a press release on the Thales website stated. Communications intelligence (COMINT) and electronic intelligence (ELINT) missions will also be tested, as well as a meshed broadband communications network for air and land players.”

HAPS offer a new opportunity to complement ground-based, satellite-based or airborne assets with unique capabilities tailored to operational requirements,” the Thales press release explained. “The stratosphere is a domain largely ignored until now that supports very-long-duration missions — up to one year — at relatively low altitudes (about 20 km), thus affording excellent resolution for observation missions and robust [links] for communications missions.”

The EuroHAPS project is being conducted with the support of six defense ministries (France, Italy, Spain, Germany, Hungary and the Czech Republic), the European Commission, the French Sud regional authority and the Canary Islands region. The latter is on board the project because, although some demonstration flights are planned to take place out of Sardinia, others will take place from Fuerteventura island, starting in 2024.

As well as demonstrating the platforms, the test flights will address the main technical risks associated with the required technologies and allow the refining of operational requirements to ultimately enable the development of future HAPS platforms.

Navy Operations to benefit from Thales – Orbis Partnership - Thales,"Mon, 13 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9jb3VudHJpZXMtYXNpYS1wYWNpZmljL2F1c3RyYWxpYS9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlL25hdnktb3BlcmF0aW9ucy1iZW5lZml0LXRoYWxlcy1vcmJpcy1wYXJ0bmVyc2hpcNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"(Left to right: Greg Thomas and Max Kufner)

Thales Australia and U.S Navy Industrial Enterprise partner, ORBIS Sibro Inc (ORBIS Inc), have entered into an agreement to collaborate on the advancement of maritime sustainment operations in support of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) at Fleet Base East, Garden Island, Sydney. The new partnership will help accelerate and future proof Australia’s maritime sustainment capability in support of the Australian Government’s National Naval Shipbuilding and Sustainment Enterprise.

The new collaboration combines Thales’s 30+ year pedigree of Naval Ship Sustainment and Support in Australia and Canada with ORBIS Inc’s extensive experience and intimate knowledge developing, delivering, and supporting the U.S. Navy’s current and future maritime sustainment solutions – the inspiration for the Royal Australian Navy’s Plan Galileo.

Over the past 20 years, Veteran Owned ORBIS Inc has developed extensive knowledge, experience and expertise in establishing sustainment system solutions for major U.S Navy and partner programs. Under these programs, ORBIS Inc played a leading role collaborating with the U.S Navy’s Naval Sea Systems Command, Warfare Centres, Program Executive Offices and the National Industrial Base to develop near and long-term solutions to critical infrastructure and industrial base challenges.

Under this agreement, Thales Australia and ORBIS Inc will focus on a range of initiatives including technological innovation and shipyard infrastructure optimisation, as well as further developing the naval sustainment industrial base and workforce. To accelerate capability advancement at Fleet Base East, the companies have recently completed preliminary feasibility studies and extensive reviews of Australia’s existing naval sustainment and support operations, workforce development and optimisation, as well as upskilling and mentoring programs.

In a more challenging Indo-Pacific, this new US-Australia maritime sustainment partnership brings together two world-leading engineering and technology companies that will help strengthen the naval support and maintenance ecosystem in the region, whilst assuring fleet readiness, availability and interoperability of Australian and allied partner current and future maritime capabilities.

Thales Australia has supported the RAN and Australian commercial fleets with ship support, sustainment and lifecycle management from Fleet Base East, Garden Island Sydney, for over 20 years. Since 2014 the Thales Australia has successfully executed 350 military and commercial ship dockings, employing over 800 highly skilled people, and investing in the development of over 100 apprentices in that time.

Max Kufner, Vice President, Above Water Systems, Thales Australian & New Zealand said, “This partnership will help deliver greater integration of platform and infrastructure through digitisation and automation of the maritime sustainment environment, which is necessary to increase the readiness, availability and performance of RAN fleets and assets.

Leveraging the world-leading technologies available to us through our reach back into the Thales Group, as well as establishing key partnerships such as this one, will allow us to leverage the deep knowledge, experience and best practice capabilities ORBIS has in its engagement with the U.S Navy that will help the RAN shape, deter and respond.”

Greg Thomas, Vice President, Submarine Initiatives, Orbis Inc, said, “Orbis’s origin and roots are in the United States’ Navy’s submarine program. As the requirements for integration and interoperability grew, Orbis leveraged and applied the knowledge, experience, and expertise developed through its submarine experience to broader Navy-wide challenges, including global supply chain, shore infrastructure, and other sustainment eco-system challenges. Partnering with Thales to lead critical elements of the Commonwealth of Australia’s Plan Galileo is as much an obligation as it is an opportunity.

The U.S. Navy’s 60/40 split - 60% of forces in the Pacific Theater, and the multiple National level alliances and relationships established to counter the emergent threats, inspire building a partnership with Thales, a company with a shared vision, strong sense of thoughtful urgency, and the ability to apply comprehensive system to assuring Allied Navy success.”"

Paris Court of Appeal destroys Lufthansa patent in dispute with Thales and Astronics - JUVE Patent,"Tue, 07 Mar 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmp1dmUtcGF0ZW50LmNvbS9jYXNlcy9wYXJpcy1jb3VydC1vZi1hcHBlYWwtZGVzdHJveXMtbHVmdGhhbnNhLXBhdGVudC1pbi1kaXNwdXRlLXdpdGgtdGhhbGVzLWFuZC1hc3Ryb25pY3Mv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"In its dispute with Thales, Astronics and Panasonic over a patent for an electrical power supply device, Germany’s flag carrier airline Lufthansa has suffered a second-instance defeat. The Paris Court of Appeal has now ruled that the aircraft manufacturer’s patent is invalid due to lack of inventive step. This confirms an initial ruling, which the first instance Paris Judicial Court handed down in 2020.

A question of safety

Lufthansa’s EP 08 81 145 covers an invention that aims to provide safety to the passenger plugging into their device, by detecting if a person has inserted a plug or foreign object. In aeroplanes, safety precautions are necessary due to the high level of voltage the plug socket permits. The patent expired in May 2018.

Astronics AES is a subsidiary of US aerospace company Astronics, with the company creating a similar technology used for in-flight electronics plugs. Thales Avionics develops and produces in-flight entertainment systems for airlines. It integrates products from Astronics into these systems. Japanese communications company Panasonic also creates in-flight entertainment and installs power sockets as part of this remit.

Lufthansa wins elsewhere

However, while Lufthansa has twice been unsuccessful in France, it has previously achieved some success in other European countries.

In Germany, Lufthansa sued Astronics for infringement at Mannheim Regional Court. The latter party responded with a nullity suit. The Federal Patent Court annulled claim 1 of EP 145 for lack of inventive step, but upheld claims two and three. Lufthansa has maintained the patent in an amended form consisting of a combination of claims one and two.

In 2015, the Regional Court Mannheim found that Astronics AES had infringed the part of Lufthansa’s EP 145 that the Federal Patent Court had upheld. In autumn 2016, the Higher Regional Court Karlsruhe confirmed this decision. Then, in the dispute over damages, the Federal Court of Justice ruled in 2019 that Astronics must pay damages to Lufthansa.

In the UK, Lufthansa brought an infringement action against Astronics and Panasonic before the High Court. In summer 2020, the first-instance court found claims one, two and three of EP 145 valid and infringed. The Court of Appeal then upheld this decision in January 2022.

Disappointment in the US and France

However, Lufthansa was also unsuccessful in the US, where the company initiated infringement proceedings at the Western District Court of Washington in Seattle. It based this case on patent US 6 016 016, which covers the same invention as EP 145. The court dismissed the claim in July 2016, a decision which the Federal Court of Appeal confirmed in October 2017.

In France, Lufthansa also directed its lawsuits against Thales, as well as Astronics and Panasonic. The defendants responded with a nullity suit, directed in particular against claims one, two, three and seven of the French part of EP 145.

Following seizures initiated by Lufthansa at the French sites of Panasonic and Astronics AES in spring 2018, the Judicial Court heard cases against all defendants together.

Trade secretive behaviour

To protect trade secrets, the defendants requested that the court not disclose certain documents in the course of proceedings. The Judicial Court initially shelved this question and focused exclusively on the validity of the patent.

In late 2020, the first-instance judges declared claims one, two, three and seven of the patent invalid due to lack of inventive step (case ID: 18/04501). While Lufthansa appealed the decision, the 2nd Chamber of the Court of Appeal has confirmed it (case ID: 20/18820).

Since the disputed patent has now expired, the main issues in France, Germany and the UK are costs and damages.

Lufthansa entrusts Jones Day

Lufthansa relied on US law firm Jones Day from the beginning of the proceedings. Munich partner Gerd Jaekel brought the client to the firm from his time at Latham & Watkins in Hamburg in 2010.

Thus, Jaekel was also involved in the German case and coordinated the cross-border proceedings. London partner Alastair McCulloch conducted the proceedings in the UK, with Thomas Bouvet running litigation for Lufthansa in Paris. Astronics and Panasonic also relied on Hogan Lovells in the UK and Germany, with partner Daniel Brook and Stephen Bennett leading the case in London.

Plasseraud represented Thales, which was only a defendant in the French part of the international dispute. The company has a long-standing relationship with Sandrine Bouvier-Ravon.

She brought the client with her when she moved from Cousin & Associés to Plasseraud earlier this year.

Thales Alenia Space has won a contract from the European Commission to proceed with development of its EuroHAPS project.

The contract is worth €43 million and will fund a demonstration craft which Thales is coordinating through a European consortium of 21 partners and 18 subcontractors from 11 countries handling the project.

EuroHAPS aims to develop several stratospheric demonstrators for missions designed to improve intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) and communications capabilities. The main project partners are CIRA, Elettronica and Leonardo from Italy, ONERA and CEA from France, INTA from Spain, and ESG with TAO from Germany.

The project will conduct flight demonstrations for three types of complementary stratospheric platforms:

A reduced-scale Stratobus from Thales Alenia Space, a solar-powered airship designed for long-endurance missions and offering large payload capacity

A Hybrid High Altitude Airship (HHAA or tactical HAPS) from CIRA, capable of generating extra lift with a wing airfoil

An Autonomous Stratospheric Balloon System (ASBaS) from ESG and TAO consisting of a series of three, altitude-controllable balloons

These three types of platforms are complementary and feature very different operating times, capacity and operational restrictions. They will give Europe a broad spectrum of solutions to meet a variety of different requirements.

EuroHAPS is reviving the use of high-altitude platform systems for government and defence missions with the support of six defence ministries (France, Italy, Spain, Germany, Hungary and the Czech Republic), the European Commission, the French Sud regional authority and the Canary Islands region, where, in addition to the ones planned in Sardinia (Italy), some demonstration flights are planned to operate from Fuerteventura island, starting in 2024.

HAPS offer a new opportunity to complement ground-based, satellite-based or airborne assets with unique capabilities tailored to operational requirements. The stratosphere is a domain largely ignored until now that supports very-long-duration missions — up to one year — at relatively low altitudes (about 20 km), thus affording excellent resolution for observation missions and robust link budgets for communications missions.

These flight demonstrations of HAPS will allow to demonstrate different platforms, address the main technical risks associated with these new technologies, while refining operational requirements to ultimately enable development of future HAPS systems."
MTA awards Crosstown Line CBTC contract to Thales and TCE - International Railway Journal,"Tue, 07 Mar 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhaWxqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9zaWduYWxsaW5nL210YS1hd2FyZHMtY3Jvc3N0b3duLWxpbmUtY2J0Yy1jb250cmFjdC10by10aGFsZXMtYW5kLXRjZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"NEW York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) has awarded a contract to the Crosstown Partners consortium formed by Thales and TC Electric (TCE) to supply CBTC signalling and associated systems to help improve punctuality and commuter journey times on New York Subway’s Crosstown Line connecting Brooklyn and Queens.

As part of the $US 368m contract, Thales will supply the SelTrac CBTC technology and maintenance of the system for 25 years, and TC Electric will act as construction contractor upgrading the stations, track and trackbed. Both consortium partners have many years’ experience of involvement in MTA projects. Crosstown Partners was announced as preferred bidder for the contract in December 2022.

The Crosstown Line is 16km long with 21 stations. Before the Covid-19 pandemic it carried tens of thousands of passengers per day. The new project will see the line undergoing a major technology upgrade which is expected to take less than five years to complete but which is likely to provide safety and reliability improvements for years to come.

In December New York City Transit, operator of the City Subway network, celebrated carrying its one billionth passenger of 2022 - although ridership is currently at 60% of 2019 pre-pandemic levels.

Thales autonomy experts - Thales,"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9jb3VudHJpZXMtZXVyb3BlL3VuaXRlZC1raW5nZG9tL25ld3MvdGhhbGVzLWF1dG9ub215LWV4cGVydHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Ben Pritchard - C4I Research & Concepts Lead

What University did you attend and what did you study?

I studied Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Imperial College. Throughout university, I increasingly specialised in robotics and software algorithms, culminating in my MEng thesis on ‘biologically inspired robotics’, which became a chess-playing robot arm!

What is your role at Thales in driving an Autonomous future?

I am the Chief Technologist in the Autonomy Technology Centre, which means I am responsible for understanding our long-term business ambitions and shaping an autonomy research strategy for achieving those technical outcomes.

It’s such a broad field that not even the 80,000-people strong Thales team could do it all alone, so it’s very much a collaborative activity. A large part of my role is therefore at the University interface, driving strategic partnerships and project collaborations that allow us to perform and commercialise the academic research into industrial use.

In particular, I helped to define what because the Trustworthy Autonomous Systems Hub, based at the University of Southampton, and now support its Executive Management Team deliver on this £33m “big idea” for the EPSRC (part of UKRI, part of BEIS).

We also looked at how humans could work most effectively in these new human-machine teams

What is your experience and expertise that qualifies you to have this role?

I have worked for Thales for 18 years and have benefited from jobs in many different sites, application domains and roles throughout that time.

Whilst working in our Transportation Systems business, we started to grapple with ‘autonomous trains’, understanding the potential value and pitfalls for evolving from ‘highly automated’ to ‘autonomous’ functions, for these safety critical systems.

From 2017, I returned to the world of corporate research and created the new Autonomous Systems Research Group. Here, I led the team that explored research challenges including how to verify and validate autonomous systems and how we could effectively plan increasingly complex missions for these uncrewed vehicles, such as maintaining offshore windfarms. We also looked at how humans could work most effectively in these new human-machine teams and how synthetic environments would help to join all these activities together and reduce the time to market for new capabilities.

During 2020-2022 I was the grateful recipient of a Royal Academy of Engineering Industrial Fellowship, which enabled me to be part-time seconded into the University of Southampton. This allowed me to lead a collaborative research project there, creating a new means of supervising squads of maritime autonomous systems working collaboratively.

What part of autonomy are you involved in?

I work in our corporate centre, which means there is potential for us to get into everything that Thales does: from the bottom of the ocean to the upper atmosphere and even further into space, as well as across cyberspace.

What binds it all together is that we deal with critical systems. We handle the decisive moments for mission and safety-critical systems throughout the world. As we introduce autonomous functions and uncrewed vehicles into these critical systems, there are fundamental challenges that need to be first understood and ultimately overcome. My role is to work across industry, government, and academia, to help share this awareness, and then enable Thales to bring the appropriate capabilities to market in the future.

What considerations are at the heart of what you (and your team) do?

There are two main points that our whole team constantly remind people.

Firstly, that these so-called “uncrewed systems” are not uncrewed! Even into the future, there will remain lots of people involved in the design and operation of autonomous vehicles and other uncrewed systems. The people have just moved.

Secondly, that these “uncrewed systems” are still just complex systems! They still require all the same diligence and governance for good systems engineering that they did before. In fact, the ‘design space’ gets harder, so we need even more systems engineering than before, not less.

The messy complexities of the real world (and real human) interactions mean that safe, reliable, trustworthy deployment of these technologies for safety-critical applications remains some way off.

These collaborative relationships, with humans interacting with autonomous ‘AI agents’ as peers, not as dumb tools, will be a step change for our design capabilities.

Can you leave us with one thought as to what you think an autonomous future looks like?

Our autonomous future will be collaborative. In everything we have studied there is always a human involved: somebody, somewhere must care about the results of a task. Otherwise, what’s the point?

These collaborative relationships, with humans interacting with autonomous ‘AI agents’ as peers, not as dumb tools, will be a step change for our design capabilities."
Indra together with FCMS and Thales kick off next design phase of the networked suite of sensors contributing to ... - Indra,"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZHJhY29tcGFueS5jb20vZW4vbm90aWNpYS9pbmRyYS10b2dldGhlci1mY21zLXRoYWxlcy1raWNrLW5leHQtZGVzaWduLXBoYXNlLW5ldHdvcmtlZC1zdWl0ZS1zZW5zb3JzLWNvbnRyaWJ1dGluZ9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"

Indra, the Spanish coordinator of the Future Combat Air System (FCAS), together with its German and French partners FCMS and Thales kick off at Indra’s new project headquarters a new phase in the development of an innovative suite of networked and distributed sensors, defensive aids and attack systems, denominated NSDAS. France, Germany and Spain, as NGWS Participating nations, have entrusted Indra as Prime, as well as FCMS, and Thales as Main Partners with the development of the new suite of sensors that will equip the platforms (NGF and RCs) of the NGWS. This development will cover the new generation sensors technology bricks and end-to-end design, with increased performance and functionalities. It will also result in undisputable air superiority in the challenging future operational scenarios by boosting sensor contribution, situational awareness, fire power, and survivability with a collaborative system architecture and services.

Based on the shared vision of a sensor suite for NGWS as defined during the previous Phase 1A, Phase 1B will initiate a wide range of ambitious functional, algorithmic and technological developments. It will consolidate the definition and architecture of the suite of networked sensors, as well as the critical components/building blocks of the RF and Optronics sensors for the NGF and for the different types of RCs. In order to support the NGWS Initial Operational Capability (IOC) in 2040 the development phase is expected to start in 2028.

The work carried out by these industrial sensor experts will also benefit from a close collaboration with the key industrial organizations of the wider NGWS program dedicated to the Combat Cloud, the NGF and the RCs.

The main paradigm shift in this next generation air combat system is the native implementation of a System of Systems approach at all NGWS levels, so that the capabilities of the whole combination of systems will be significantly higher than the sum of the individual assets. With regards to sensors, NSDAS natively implements such features based on the disruptive cross-platform collaborative approach.

A strong industrial and national joint effort will be the cornerstone of success for achieving the ambitious NGWS goals. The superiority of the NGWS within the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) will widely depend on the unprecedented ability of its sensors network to gather, process, and distribute information. FCMS, Indra and Thales common vision for the NSDAS solution is the basis for the success in this initiative.

The kick-off of the Phase 1B activities represents a very important milestone in FCMS, Indra and Thales firm commitment to keep working towards the joint development of the innovative NSDAS vision for the future NGWS.

About FCMS

With the German companies Hensoldt Sensors GmbH, Diehl Defence GmbH & Co. KG, ESG Elektroniksystem- und Logistik-GmbH and Rohde & Schwarz GmbH & Co. KG, the industrial consortium FCMS concentrates essential core competencies of the national key technologies under one roof. FCMS offers a broad and well-founded national technology expertise for the FCAS/NGWS program and thus ensures the necessary national capability to contribute to, and future-proof the 6th generation mission systems.

The partnership will focus on delivering shipyard infrastructure optimization and technological innovations for the site.

To further advance the base’s capability, the companies conducted feasibility studies on the navy’s current support and sustainment setup, workforce, upskilling, and mentoring programs.

Works under the collaboration will be conducted under Australia’s National Naval Shipbuilding and Sustainment Enterprise initiative, which invests in long-term sustainable shipbuilding approaches while securing jobs for the country.

Modernizing Maritime Environment

The Thales-Orbis teaming is expected to bolster the Royal Australian Navy’s maritime support and maintenance across the region.

The resulting solutions will improve Australia’s naval cooperation with the US and allied nations.

“This partnership will help deliver greater integration of platform and infrastructure through digitisation and automation of the maritime sustainment environment, which is necessary to increase the readiness, availability and performance of RAN fleets and assets,” Thales Australia Above Water Systems Vice President Max Kufner stated.

Leveraging Experience

For two decades, Thales has supported Australian defense and commercial fleets from Fleet Base East. Meanwhile, Orbis has supplied sustainment solutions to the US Navy for more than 20 years.

“Orbis’s origin and roots are in the United States Navy’s submarine program.

“As the requirements for integration and interoperability grew, Orbis leveraged and applied the knowledge, experience, and expertise developed through its submarine experience to broader Navy-wide challenges, including global supply chain, shore infrastructure, and other sustainment ecosystem challenges.”

“Partnering with Thales to lead critical elements of the Commonwealth of Australia’s Plan Galileo is as much an obligation as it is an opportunity,” Orbis Submarine Initiatives Vice President Greg Thomas stated."

Thales, a secure travel and identity document provider for over 150 government programs, was awarded the contract for Finnish passports, eID cards and eResident Permits last year, and supplies the biometric technology embedded in the IDs.

This contract covers the design, production and personalization of Finnish identity cards, biometric passports, residence cards and resident permit cards. It also includes other services such as temporary passport personalization, warehousing and invoicing.

“The Finnish authorities have been cooperating with Thales for decades, and we look forward to continuing this cooperation,” says the chief of license administration, Hanna Piipponen, of the National Police Board of Finland.

The documents include new anti-forgery features, updated security features in the polycarbonate data page and eID card, a larger photo size on the ID cards and a color picture on the passport paper page. Additionally, Thales incorporated a 2D bar code for easier machine recognition and reading.

“We are very honored that this contract has been awarded to us, and we will continue to provide passports and other identity documents for both Finland and worldwide,” says Thales DIS CEO Tommi Nordberg.

The company says the delivery process for end-users will remain largely the same, with deliveries made mainly to distributor outlets throughout Finland. A new subcontractor has taken over the distribution of permit documents and an expanded service offer will provide rapid delivery of passports and ID cards to a larger geographical area.

For sustainability purposes, Thales adds that its cards have extended usage lifecycles.

“Thales is fully committed to sustainability, so we are also offsetting the carbon emissions from all our travel and ID solutions,” adds Nordberg.

This contract is initially set to last five years, with the potential for extensions.

Thales recently made headlines for partnering with IDScan.net to create products that tackle offenses and fraud using fake IDs, particularly underage drinking in the U.S.

Introduced by IDScan.net, the company says it will unite Thales’s identity document scanners and its own VeriScan Authentication software to verify IDs against watermark and hologram libraries.

Laura Nielsen

Laura Nielsen is a Strategic HR professional, Senior Coach and Chartered Occupational Psychologist in training. She’s one of our unsung heroes at Thales UK in championing neurodiversity.

As a mother of two neurodiverse children, Laura’s made it her mission to help families navigate the impossible path to find the best educational support for their children with invisible disabilities. This Neurodiversity Celebration Week we caught up with Laura to find out how she’s using her personal experiences to help improve the lives of other parents and employees.

When did you first discover that your children were neurodivergent?

My daughter was five when we started the assessment process, it took two years to go through the NHS system to diagnosis and a further three years to get her placed in a specialist school through the Education, Health and Care plan (ECHP) scheme. This was a tough period for her and us, as the years passed she was getting left further behind academically.

After first realising that my child had differences, I went through the typical cycle of denial at the start, fear over what the future would look like for her and by the end, when we finally got a diagnosis, I cried out of relief. I didn’t know anything about neurodiversity, but as soon as I started researching it, everything made sense.

There is a strong genetic component with neurodiversity so when my son was born a few years later I was spotting things I didn’t know about before and got access to help and resources much earlier, which meant he was diagnosed at the age of three and had his ECHP before he had even started school.

What inspired you to want to help others?

The thing with invisible disabilities is you’re dealing with something people can’t see and often have had no exposure to, this creates a barrier in convincing those that can provide help, of the reality of the need.

I found the early days very lonely due to the lack of formal or social support. You’re being judged by the school, friends, family and other parents who are not having the same experience as you, which is incredibly isolating. This created fear of sharing what was really happening and it was only when I started to connect with other parents of neurodivergent children that I realised I was not alone; others were in the same boat and had learnt how to navigate the education system.

I quickly realised the significance of my role in advocating for my child in a broken and unhelpful system, where knowledge is power. Sharing experience doesn’t cost anything, but makes a huge difference to people facing adversity in getting crucial support for their children.

This passion flowed in to my activity at Thales, where I co-founded the neurodiversity network in 2019; through this I’ve also met and helped other parents. The knowledge I have acquired about different neurodiverse conditions and lived experience, has enabled me to help many neurodiverse employees in communicating their needs to their managers and getting the required adjustments.

Tell us more about the work you are doing at Thales

Neurodivergent people have the ability to see things from different perspectives and for a tech company like Thales you can’t put a price on the benefit that can bring. Attention to detail, problem solving, deep empathy, pattern recognition or spotting opportunities that other people aren’t able to see – these are all amazing strengths.

I’m currently working on a strategic project that’s looking at how we can better understand and meet the needs of our neurodivergent colleagues so that every employee feels supported, enabled and included. We’re actively adapting internal processes and introducing adjustments for employees like specialist coaching, assistive tech and employee to manager facilitation.

What’s next?

Outside of my job at Thales, I’ve set up a trip advisor-style website for parents to share honest accounts of what a school, whether mainstream, independent or specialist, is really like because there is so much variation and this information does not exist. The idea came to me while I was trying to identify a suitable school, as there was very little information to help me. Asking for advice from other parents on social media was the best input I could find, but that is not searchable content, so I decided to self-fund a site where experiences can be captured and searched.

I spent years feeling like a failure, ashamed because I couldn’t help my child or make things better and I want to help other families recognise that they don’t have to accept that experience. The 2022 Special Educational Needs in England report estimates there are 1.5 million (16.5%) pupils with special educational needs; that’s an awful lot of families in need of information and support. My hope is that by making the invisible experiences of families like mine visible, it will help others and drive improvements, so that every child gets access to the support they need, when they need it.

Are you interested in Martian Science? MARSBalloon is an exciting project for school students and budding space scientists to carry out experiments equivalent to visiting the surface of our closest planetary neighbour – all without pulling on a spacesuit.

The MARSBalloon will carry over 150 experiments to an altitude of 30km, more than twice the height of commercial airliners, where they will be above 99 per cent of Earth’s atmosphere. Along the way they will experience conditions very similar to those on Mars, including temperatures of -50°C and pressures 1/100th of sea level.

This allows students to test the response of electronics, materials, plants and even food, to the conditions outside of a future Mars base, helping explorers prepare for this strange and hostile environment.

After approximately one hour, the balloon will burst and the experiments will return to Earth via parachute. The experiments are then returned to participants to analyse the results.

There is still time to register your interest and reserve a space on the flight, with entries closing on 31 March. You’ll then have until late May to design and deliver your experiment, with the launch taking place in early June.

Commenting on the latest iteration of the MARSBalloon launch, Andrew Stanniland, CEO of Thales Alenia Space in the UK said:

Ever since the MARSBalloon project launched, I have constantly been astounded by the quality of the experiments, as well as the fabulously imaginative designs.

“I can’t wait to see what the 2023 participants come up with, and I’m certain this experience will excite them about space and open their eyes to the many opportunities that exist within STEM subjects!""

“I would encourage all schools who might be interested to register their interest before the shuttle doors close at the end of the month.”

Some of the experiments from previous years include testing how medical products would survive on Mars, the temperature and pressure effects on building materials and how radiation impacts electronics.

Entry is available to any school or youth group nationally, and aims to give students a practical experience of designing objects to go into space, as well as considering careers in the UK space and other tech industries.

DSTA Operations deputy chief executive Roy Chan said: “This new agreement moves DSTA to take an agile and nimble approach to capability development. It enables us to continuously innovate and upgrade our systems to retain the capability to handle new threats in our challenging operating environment, in great contrast to the conventional way of developing mid-life upgrades every ten-15 years.”

The master agreement builds on an initial memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed between Thales and DSTA in February 2022.

Under this MoU, the two entities worked together to boost efficiency and establish radar digital technology research partnerships, as well as set up data exchanges between the entities.

The agreement will now see the deployment of Thales’ trained engineering and services experts in Singapore to work with DSTA and the SAF to deliver service quality.

The local presence of Thales’ experts will help to minimise the downtime risk in critical scenarios.

Furthermore, Thales has also set up a Radar Centre of Excellence under its Research & Technology department to develop radar digital technologies and bring local radar expertise to Singapore."
How biometrics are driving airport recovery - Airports International Magazine,"Wed, 08 Mar 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpcnBvcnRzaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9ob3ctYmlvbWV0cmljcy1hcmUtZHJpdmluZy1haXJwb3J0LXJlY292ZXJ50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Biometrics have a key role to play in getting airports back to business post-pandemic, explains Justin Walker, VP for digital transformation, Thales Few industries have been more severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic than the travel sector. Finally, however, after years of lockdown and restrictions, the industry can make its long-awaited comeback. Travellers are looking forward to a seamless travel experience once again – and that startsat the airport. Achieving this is not without challenges. The sector needs to ensure the smooth transition of millions of travellers every day, all the while remaining secure and compliant. In this article, we’ll be looking at how biometrics are already helping ease pressure at airports, and how they could help in the future.

Widespread adoption of automated border control technology is streamlining the verification of millions of travellers every year

What is biometric security? Biometrics is a type of security that verifies a user’s physical characteristics and behaviour to identify them. It is considered one of the most accurate and robust forms of ID verification available. Whether or not we know it, many of us use biometric authentication on a daily basis, perhaps in the form of facial recognition on smartphones, or fingerprint recognition when we log onto an online banking app. Biometrics can increase efficiency by removing the need for manual checks, providing both convenience and security, as there are no tokens to carry or passwords to remember. They’re difficult to duplicate and after a certain age remain consistent. The prevalence, and acceptance, of biometrics as a form of identification is also on the rise. Aside from the smartphone example, biometrics are commonly used in a number of industries, including financial services, where they often take the form of biometric bank cards. By integrating a fingerprint scanner into the card, banks can afford consumers unparalleled security when making payments, in a convenient way, to protect their financial information from fraudsters.

Thales Justin Walker, VP for digital transformation

Helping with border security So, how exactly can biometrics help the airport industry? Yes, airports need to ensure a swift service for customers and create a seamless travel experience, but security and safety is still vital and cannot be compromised on. However, thanks to biometric technology, one does not have to be sacrificed for the sake of the other. One such example of biometrics in action lies with automated border control systems. Also commonly known as eGates, automated border control systems (ABC) are automated self-service barriers which use data stored in a chip in biometric passports along with a fingerprint or photo taken at the time of entering – this verifies the passport holder’s identity. The passport needs to be authenticated, the traveller’s identity needs to be verified, and that identity needs to be checked and cleared with government and third-party systems. While this sounds like a cumbersome process, it’s actually done in a matterof seconds – enabling travellers to move through border control seamlessly and effortlessly.

On-the-move facial recognition and contactless fingerprint scanning challenge the need to even have doors

Thales ICAO aims to convert passports into Digital Travel Credentials, meaning that digital passports and e-visas will be accessed from the same digital wallet

Consider the numbers: there are over 1.2 billion electronic passports now in service worldwide, which means 1.2 billion passport photos are accessible in an internationally standardised format via facial recognition systems. Widespread adoption of automated border control technology is streamlining the verification of millions of travellers every year, as well as easing the burden on border force staff. This is one of the most challenging use cases for biometrics, and one that has already been implemented in a growing number of airports. And there is more to come. In order to allow more and more people to use the eGates, wider designs for wheelchair users and for families to be processed as one group are now being

deployed. On-the-move facial recognition and contactless fingerprint scanning challenge the

need to even have doors. Even more excitingly, ICAO’s plans to turn passports into Digital Travel Credentials will one day allow digital passports, e-visas and health certificates to be accessed from the same digital wallet on the traveller’s mobile, enabling all of this to be verified with a tap-and-go experience.

Thales eGates verify traveller identity using data stored in a chip in biometric passports along with a fingerprint or photo

Biometrics and future travel processes Biometrics also hold the solution to streamlining the outbound passenger journey experience. Whether using an airport eGate or their mobile phone, travellers are now becoming aware that they carry their biometrics with them – so imagine if it could be used to create a unique ID, allowing passage through check-in, bag drop, border control and security at the gate. Mobile digital identity solutions are being designed to specifically improve and streamline the passenger experience – while satisfying robust security protocols. Digital ID and facial biometrics can be harnessed to do just that – all the while removing the need for passengers to show a ticket or ID at every touchpoint. How would this work? A passenger would start by enrolling. This involves using an app to capture their passport data page, passport chip image, authenticate the passport, capture a face image, check the face is live, then match the live face to the passport chip facial image. When checking in with an airline they’d then share their biometrics, assuming always that they agree to do so. This information, combined with the Digital Travel Credential, means the traveller can then be identified at all the touchless self-service points within a terminal. The technology works in real time – with the token erased once the flight has taken off, ensuring absolute data privacy.

"Thales Australia continuing to invest in capability for Garden Island Defence Precinct, Sydney - Thales","Tue, 14 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoYWxlc2dyb3VwLmNvbS9lbi9jb3VudHJpZXMtYXNpYS1wYWNpZmljL2F1c3RyYWxpYS9yZWZlcmVuY2VzL3RoYWxlcy1hdXN0cmFsaWEtY29udGludWluZy1pbnZlc3QtY2FwYWJpbGl0eS1nYXJkZW7SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales Australia’s recent acquisition and commission of a new Computer Numerical Control (CNC) Lathe is proving a game-changer for the Production teams at Garden Island in their mission to support the Royal Australian Navy to keep Australia safe.

The CNC lathe, a multi-axis fully automated machine controlled by computer numerical control software, creates complex three-dimensional parts in various materials with high precision. With this type of machinery, it is possible to drill, turn, mill, cut and perform other industrial operations to produce complex parts.

AWS Production Director, Andrew Field says, “For our teams, it means increased efficiency and, most importantly, enhanced safety. It’s another example of Thales continuing to invest in building capability for the Navy at Garden Island.”

Pierce Bolger, AWS Machinist and CNC lathe operator says, “The new CNC lathe is just 6-months old but has already increased our capability to deliver quality outcomes to support Navy.”

The new lathe has added features and improvements such as a four-axis configuration; meaning the variety of parts that can now be produced is more extensive. Due to fully automatic functioning, an advantage of the machine is its repeatability, reliability and consistent results for mass production projects. Accuracy is 100% which also means less wastage of raw materials which in turn reduces costs.

In addition to speed of generation, the CNC lathe also produces a wider variety of parts. Pierce adds, “Due to automated fabrication, we monitor the functioning of the system without manual intervention -which means a hands-off, safer work environment. The technology of the new CNC lathe also has extra safety features with more interlocks, checks, alarms, a safety door and a swarf conveyor which empties itself into a swarf bin.”

Higher efficiency is also achieved since CNC machines stop working as soon as any deficiency or error is traced. This immediate action streamlines processes, reduces unscheduled stoppages and improves overall efficiency.

Pierce says, “The majority of what we're making and repairing are replacement parts. Parts for the Destroyer, Guided Missile (DDG), a locknut for a rudder on a ship, an extraction tool for the locking bolts on the rudder of Sycamore, etc. Any and all parts that are required at short-notice, and parts that can’t be obtained from the logistics stores, can be rapidly produced for the customer.”

In one instance, a ship was departing dock within the week and there was an urgent need for a part. The team didn’t have sufficient time to source it externally, so manufactured the part themselves and the ship departed on schedule.

Production Line Manager, Mechanical, Steven Wilton highlights the benefits of direct discussion with the customer saying, “We have this capability on site at Garden Island and we speak directly to the customer about their requirements. We then reverse engineer it, produce it and provide it. You don’t have that benefit when you send a job to be outsourced externally.”"

Samara Buchanan, Marketing Manager, Maritime

Thales Marketing Manager, Maritime, Samara Buchanan has been appointed to the Shipbuilding Enterprise for Growth Shadow Board (SEG).

Samara was awarded a place following a competitive application process, which looked for a broad representation of aspiring leaders across industry and academia. Her appointment is a reflection of her deep understanding of the sector, gained over the last seven years in her roles as market analyst and marketing manager. As well as her passion for driving positive change in the maritime industry.

As the main interface between industry and government, the SEG was formed to implement the National Shipbuilding Strategy refresh. Made up of senior government and industry leaders, it identifies actions to improve productivity and competitiveness through technology, innovation and the supply chain. The Shadow Board exists to give the SEG insight, ideas and feedback on proposed policy and strategic decision-making; making sure they’re considering a wide range of perspectives, beyond their own.

Championing diversity

Crucially, it also has a role to play in developing the next generation of talent and promoting more diversity and inclusion in the maritime sector. Something that the National Shipbuilding Office (NSO) is very serious about. That makes it both a personal and professional achievement for Samara, who’s fired up about the issue of diversity in the sector.

“I want to be part of something where I can advocate for policy and for changes in the market, especially where I think that they will have implications for marginalised groups. I want to help create a sector and a world where we reflect the reality of the UK in 2023.”

A direct line to customers

Samara’s looking forward to applying her skills in creative and strategic thinking to the complex questions the board is trying to answer. Samara is particularly excited about the opportunity to speak directly to SMEs, suppliers, academics and stakeholders and getting their insights into hot button issues and where they need support.

Rear Admiral Rex Cox, CEO of the NSO and Co-Chair of the SEG said: “I am really excited that we have selected the Shadow Board who come from a broad range of backgrounds and who will provide advice, insights and constructive challenge to help inform our thinking on the SEG. It allows us to engage with the future industry senior leaders and draw on their broad range of interests and experience. It is an excellent way of amplifying different voices from across the sector and I am grateful to leading companies like Thales for recognising the importance of this and supporting their employees to work with us.”

Samara’s commitment to the SEG Shadow Board will continue for 12 months, but could extend to two years as the SEG works towards a globally successful, innovative and sustainable shipbuilding enterprise for the UK."
3 inventions Einstein made possible - Thales,"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGFsZXNncm91cC5jb20vZW4vbWFya2V0cy9kaWdpdGFsLWlkZW50aXR5LWFuZC1zZWN1cml0eS9tb2JpbGUvbWFnYXppbmUvMy1ldmVyeWRheS1pbnZlbnRpb25zLWVpbnN0ZWluLW1hZGUtcG9zc2libGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"What did Albert Einstein invent?

Albert Einstein was not an inventor in the sense of da Vinci, Bell, or Edison.

Yet, he is recognized as one of the greatest physicists of all time and a genius for many.

This talented and fiercely independent mathematician and thinker changed how we see the universe through his theories and vision of physics.

In November 1915, Albert Einstein gave a series of lectures on his general theory of relativity at the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin.

It was the culmination of years of work, beginning with four groundbreaking papers in 1905:

On his quantum theory of light (that light is a particle or photon),

of light (that light is a particle or photon), On the existence of atoms (the Brownian movement );

); On his theory of special relativity (that length and time are not fixed and depend on the observer's frame of reference),

(that length and time are not fixed and depend on the observer's frame of reference), E=MC2 (that energy is linked to mass and the speed of light) on the equation for which he is most famous). A tiny particle of matter can create a vast quantity of energy, the basis of nuclear power.

Just think about it.

He published these papers when he was just 26.

Science would never be the same.

Ten years later, Einstein further shook the physics world by theorizing that space and time are dynamic and distorted, affecting how objects and light move.

This supposition was his general theory of relativity - his unified description of gravity.

(Find a plain English primer on his main theories here.)

Three major inventions derived from Einstein's discoveries

But these theories weren't confined to the lab.

Since Einstein gave his lectures, what impact have his discoveries had on our everyday lives in the century?

1. Satnavs and Google Maps

It's hard to get lost because of GPS - it allows our satnavs (satellite navigation systems) and smartphone map apps to tell us the quickest route to the restaurant or the beach.

But if it weren't for Einstein's general theory of relativity, we wouldn't know to consider relativity's effects when synchronizing the network of Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites orbiting the Earth.

This fact means their data would be filled with errors, making GPS more or less useless.

Einstein's theory of relativity shows that gravity and motion can affect time. In GPS, the satellites that locate places move fast and are far from Earth's gravity, causing time to pass faster than on the ground. This can lead to errors in GPS, but atomic clocks can accurately measure time despite the effects of relativity. GPS is made reliable and accurate by using atomic clocks and adjusting for time differences.

2. Your phone's clock

Most ISPs and mobile phone masts use GPS to set the time. And with each GPS satellite containing several atomic clocks, your computer and mobile phone clocks are ultra-accurate.

Without that accuracy, you'd probably be late (or early) for every meeting.

There's more.

3. Lasers

What makes a supermarket's doors open automatically as you approach?

Why do home security systems alert you to the presence of an intruder?

How do smoke alarms detect fires?

Lasers are crucial to all these inventions and more.

Einstein's 1916 discovery of the physical principle was responsible for light amplification by stimulating the emission of radiation (the long-winded way of saying laser) that made these devices possible.

These are just three examples - virtually no corner of science and technology hasn't experienced the Einstein effect, from supercomputers and supernovas to nuclear weapons and the Big Bang.

And in our ever-more-digital world, what happens in the lab is never far from everyday life.

Re-evaluating Mileva Marić's contributions to Einstein's work

Albert Einstein's first wife was Mileva Marić.

They met while studying physics at the Polytechnic in Zurich, Switzerland, and married in 1903. Marić was also a physicist; evidence suggests she contributed significantly to Einstein's work. However, their marriage was tumultuous, and they eventually separated in 1914, with a divorce finalized in 1919.

The extent of Mileva Marić's contribution to Einstein's work is a matter of debate among historians of science.

Some evidence suggests that Marić collaborated with Einstein on his early papers and may have contributed to his theories of relativity.

For example, in the early 1900s, Einstein and Marić worked on a paper exploring the relationship between mass and energy. The document was written in Einstein's handwriting, but some researchers believe that Marić made significant contributions to the calculations and ideas presented in the paper.

There are also letters between Einstein and Marić that suggest they discussed physics and collaborated on other papers. In one letter, Einstein refers to ""our work on relative motion,"" which some historians interpret as evidence of a joint project between the two.

However, there is also evidence that Marić's contributions to Einstein's work were overstated in some accounts. Some argue that the available evidence does not definitively prove that Marić made significant contributions to Einstein's theories of relativity.

Einstein's biography in a nutshell

Albert Einstein was a German-born physicist and one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century. He was born in Ulm, Germany, in 1879, and his contributions to theoretical physics have revolutionized our understanding of the universe.

Albert Einstein's education: He received his primary education at a Catholic elementary school in Munich and later attended the Luitpold Gymnasium, where he was given advanced schooling. After his family moved to Italy, he stayed in Munich to finish his education. Einstein struggled with the school's rote learning methods and eventually left to join his family.

Einstein furthered his education at the Argovian cantonal school in Aarau, Switzerland, and excelled, especially in physics and mathematics. He graduated from the Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich.

In 1933, due to persecution by the Nazi regime and as a Jew, Einstein emigrated to the United States and renounced his German citizenship. He later became a naturalized US citizen in 1940.

Einstein passed away on April 18, 1955, at 76, due to complications related to an abdominal aortic aneurysm (Princeton, NJ, USA).

Einstein's legacy extends far beyond his scientific achievements. He was also a passionate advocate for peace and civil rights, using his platform to promote social justice causes and raise awareness about issues affecting humanity.

Einstein was also a skilled violinist and a prolific writer.

He published over 300 scientific papers and over 150 non-scientific works during his lifetime.

His work has profoundly impacted modern physics and influenced countless scientists, engineers, and thinkers.

So, if you're wondering, ""What is Albert Einstein famous for?"" it's his immense contributions to the field of physics and his theory of relativity which fundamentally changed our understanding of the universe.

NEW DELHI: Air India ’s historic 470 aircraft order will provide fillip not just to original equipment manufacturers such as aircraft majors Airbus and Boeing but will also open opportunities for equipment and technology providers such as Thales, which provides avionics services to Air India.In a conversation with ET Infra, Ashish Saraf , Vice President & Country Director, Thales India , outlined that the company will very soon set up a maintenance, repair & overhaul ( MRO ) center for avionics and in-flight entertainment systems in India.“On the aviation side, we are already working to establish a MRO in India. So we had announced that last year, but now we can see that now it's concrete to a level where we have already launched a site selection, and very soon we will be announcing where we will be in terms of our MRO,” said Saraf.Thales India also plans to hire over 500 engineers in the current year as the French origin company completes 70 years in India.Saraf highlighted that after the takeover of Air India by the Tata Group , the opportunity associated with the airline and the relationship with it has become more strategic because of the amount of investment that Tata Group is undertaking in the airline.Air India’s acquisition of 470 fleet, comprising wide-body and narrow-body aircraft, is valued at a list price of $70 billion and the airline has invested between $400 million to $600 million on technology, platforms and refurbishment of interiors of aircraft.“Thales is doing an equal amount of investment and one of the decisions to have our own MRO here is driven by the fact that we want to be next to our customers, Air India, Indigo, Vistara, and so on. It obviously opens up a tremendous amount of opportunities for us to, to serve them for the future where we want to be next to them and this is how our partnership is going to evolve,” he said.DEFENSE SUPPORTSimilar to the upcoming civil aviation MRO, Thales is also establishing a ‘Defense Customer Service Center’ in India where all the spares, maintenance, repair and support activity will be done locally with an Indian support base. The company provides avionics, radars and systems, optronics, electronic warfare systems, among others to the Indian defense forces.Thales has tied up with state-owned Bharat Dynamics Ltd for manufacturing of STARStreak short-range surface to air missile, also known as a man-portable air-defense system or MANPADS. These missile systems are currently being used by Ukrainian forces against Russian military in the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe.“...we clearly identified a few programs that we are bringing in as ‘Make in India’. The classic example is the STARStreak MANPAD system, which will be fully transferred in India, technologically, to be made in India, and not only for India, but also to have exports for global consumption,” said Saraf."

Russia intensifies cyberattacks on Ukraine allies - Al Jazeera English,"Wed, 29 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzMvMjkvcnVzc2lhLWludGVuc2lmaWVzLWN5YmVyYXR0YWNrcy1vbi11a3JhaW5lLWFsbGllc9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsamF6ZWVyYS5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvMjAyMy8zLzI5L3J1c3NpYS1pbnRlbnNpZmllcy1jeWJlcmF0dGFja3Mtb24tdWtyYWluZS1hbGxpZXM?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Russian ‘hacktivists’ are hitting Poland and Nordic and Baltic countries with an arsenal of cyberweapons, analysts say.

Russia’s cyberwar on Ukraine has largely failed and Moscow is increasingly targeting Kyiv’s European allies, according to US and French analysts.

French defence firm Thales said in a report on Wednesday that Russia was hitting Poland and Nordic and Baltic countries with an arsenal of cyberweapons aiming to sow divisions and promote anti-war messages.

“These groups of independent, civilian hacktivists have emerged as a new component in the conflict. They can be assimilated to a cybercriminal group with specific political objectives and interests, acting out of conviction, yet not directly sponsored by any government. Members of such groups have a broad array of origins, technical skills and backgrounds,” Thales said in a statement.

About 60 percent of all cyberattacks reported worldwide were conducted by Russian hackers, the report said.

Microsoft said in a threat assessment earlier this month that Russian actors had launched attacks in at least 17 European countries in the first six weeks of this year.

Russia’s assault on Ukraine began on February 24 last year, but it has not been able to score a decisive victory on the battlefield over its much smaller neighbour.

No ‘game-changing blow’

Thales and Microsoft said Russia’s invasion was accompanied by widespread cyberattacks in Ukraine, but they were repelled.

“Cyberwarfare didn’t deliver the game-changing blow that Russia hoped for,” said Thales’ technical director for cyber defence, Ivan Fontarensky, highlighting the resilience of Ukraine’s defences.

Both firms said Russia shifted focus to other European countries late last year.

“In the third quarter of 2022, Europe was dragged into a high-intensity hybrid cyberwar at a turning point in the conflict,” said Pierre-Yves Jolivet, Thales vice president for cyber solutions.

Jolivet said countries outside Ukraine were suffering a “massive wave” of DDoS attacks – when a server is flooded with requests that crash the network.

These attacks were increasingly carried out by groups aligned with the Kremlin rather than official groups, and they aimed to sow chaos rather than destroy infrastructure, Thales said.

Poland, Latvia and Sweden were among the most affected countries. Montenegro and Moldova – candidates for European integration – were also being targeted.

Microsoft said in its assessment that attacks this year in Europe were largely aimed at government entities for espionage purposes.

Highlighting the global reach of Russian actors, the firm said 21 percent of attacks outside Ukraine since the start of the war had hit the United States.

While attacks outside Ukraine were often low-level harassment, Microsoft said Russia may well choose more damaging cyber tools in the future.

“Should Russia suffer more setbacks on the battlefield, Russian actors may seek to expand their targeting of military and humanitarian supply chains by pursuing destructive attacks beyond Ukraine and Poland,” said Microsoft."

Yet, in the age of digital warfare, balancing these considerations is essential to enable the modern soldier to work in an environment where access to large bandwidths cannot be guaranteed. The seamless sharing of actionable data is a prized capability that gives military units the competitive edge.

Thales offers its new SHArc – soldier harness architecture – as its solution for the capacity of dismounted soldiers to share data as effectively as possible across their networks. This soldier-worn power and data hub was showcased at the Future Soldier Technology conference on 8 March.

The SHArc is essentially an enabling hub that allows soldiers to scale their data processing capacity in environments deprived of large bandwidths. This is achieved by several means: through integration with other devices, to provision a centralised power architecture, and by enabling automatic over-the-air transmission of data.

Soldier integration

“Our aim is to deliver a ‘network-agnostic’ intelligent soldier-worn power and data hub,” a Thales spokesperson expressed to Army Technology.

“Although we see an increasing number of digital soldier devices coming onto the market, there are still a number of legacy devices in service around the world,” Thales continued. “SHArc is designed to enable digital device integration but can also integrate many legacy devices.”

This means that all connected devices can seamlessly exchange data, reducing cognitive burden on soldiers and increasing operational tempo.

The data that is sent over to tactical networks needs to be filtered to prevent the transmission of meaningless data noise. Smart hubs like the SHArc can help enormously, they can be programmed to send very small data messages over the network from a digital sensor which may generate quite large amounts of data, which just contains the essential information needed by other soldiers in a unit, or command and control (C2).

The SHArc is a versatile data hub with the capability to enable other devices like AI processors, if there is room for scaling up AI capability. Where we would see SHArc having a role in this system is integrating the processor with other devices, enabling power provision from the central power architecture, and in filtering data to be sent over the network.

“For example, you could have a digital camera connected to the processor and tactical radio through the SHArc. A soldier equipped with these devices takes a picture of an individual at a check point with the camera, the SHArc sends the image to the processor which has facial recognition AI, the individual is identified as a ‘person of interest’, the SHArc receives that information and is programmed to automatically send a message to the Soldier’s Commander over the network, which is displayed through the Commander’s End User Device saying ‘Person of interest identified at location x by Soldier y’.

“In this way, AI capabilities are utilised without sending large amounts of data over the tactical network,” Thales stated.

Operator scalability

Ultimately it will be for the end-user to decide what capabilities they use and to what extent. The unique aspect Thales offers is that the SHArc is an enabling hub that may be used scalably.

“We believe the answer lies in designing architectures that mean capabilities like AI can be deployed in bandwidth-limited environments, and that SHArc could be a key enabler of that,” Thales asserted.

Even if the capability is worthwhile, industries cannot endlessly add to the dismounted soldier’s load at the expense of their ability to operate effectively. This is why Thales’s engineering solution is more of a compromise – as power consumption translates directly into weight in the Soldier System space.

“A good example is the selection of the processor for the hub, which is optimised to provide the processing power required at an acceptable power consumption. A more powerful processor could have been chosen, which would have given more capability, but the hub itself would have needed to be bigger (it weighs about 250g), and it would have required several 100s of grams more batteries to power it,” the company remarked.

The scalability of the SHArc solution is provided by the ability to “daisy chain” hubs together, giving more available ports for Soldiers with more demanding configurations (like forward artillery or air observers). For many, one hub will be sufficient. A single-type solution also has benefits in terms of logistic simplicity."

The project to modernise all of Algeria’s 10 Super lynx MK-130/140 helicopters was completed in January 2023. Algeria acquired the helicopters in a November 2007 deal for four Super Lynx Mk 130 and six AW101 Mk 610 Merlin helicopters. They are equipped with the ability to carry the South African Mokopa air-to-surface missile.

The naval Super Lynx is a multi-role helicopter for anti-surface warfare, anti-submarine warfare, search and rescue and utility operations. The Super Lynx is the export version of the Lynx helicopter from AgustaWestland (formerly GKN Westland Helicopters).

The two Super Lynx anti-submarine warfare helicopters tracked the Israeli Dolphin-class submarine, after which it was cornered by two Algerian navy project 636 submarines, and then forced to surface in international waters and leave the area.

During the engagement, the Israeli Dolphin surfaced to indicate that it was abandoning the mission and moving away from the Algerian coast. It surfaced 5 km north of Kalaat Ben Abbès, on the edge of international waters outside the training zone.

Designed for smaller and lighter helicopters, the new FLASH compact features an optimised, lightweight architecture and a fully electric reeling machine to enable high-performance sonar system deployment for conducting anti-submarine warfare missions.

Thales low frequency dipping sonar FLASH (Folding Light Acoustic System for Helicopters) is designed for any type of ASW helicopter and is already certified on the ASW versions of platforms such as MH60R, NFH90 “Caiman”, Super Puma, AW101 “Merlin”, AW159 or SL300.

Developed to meet the weight and size requirements of smaller helicopters, the FLASH Compact sonar when integrated with the sonobuoy processing system acts as a complete and effective sonar suite for light aircraft.

Operated as an integrated tactical system or a stand-alone system, the dipping sonars can be used to detect, classify, locate, track and engage enemy submarines and perform mine clearance operations.

The system can be used with shipborne sonars to determine the exact location of a target before launching a strike.

When linked with an active/passive sonobuoy processing system, the FLASH Sonics configuration system provides anti-submarine warfare capability, as well as helps identify small, slow-moving or stationary underwater targets.

The Compact FLASH is dedicated to lightweight helicopters, that features an electrical winch rather than a hydraulic winch. Compact FLASH, which has been specifically developed for the AgustaWestland Super Lynx 300 and AW159 naval helicopters, uses the same FLASH Submersible Unit, Transmitter/Receiver unit and acoustic processing as installed in larger Anti-Submarine Warfare helicopters thus providing the same unrivalled ASW capability to smaller 5-6 tonne class helicopters."

This month, Thales reported 5.5% of organic growth in sales for FY22. The company has plans to improve recruitment and supply chains to boost sales in FY23.

“With Thales SquadNet, the Austrian Armed Forces will be one of the first European countries to have a highly modern software-defined radio system with full digital signal processing in use, thereby reaching technological leadership in the field of tactical communication.

“As a trusted partner, Thales is very pleased to support the Austrian Ministry of Defensein the modernisation and digitalisation of their armed forces,” says Hannes Boyer, CEO & country director Thales in Austria.

SquadNet the start of slow progress for Austria’s military modernisation?

Neutrality and a lack of military spending have limited Austria’s defence modernisation in the past, with the country having a military budget of $3.4bn in 2023. However, the military budget will rise to $5.8bn by 2028.

In the GlobalData Analyst Briefing – Ukraine crisis a wake-up call for Austrian military spending, aerospace and defence analyst William Davies stated: “The Austrian military lacks modern equipment and significant purchasing capabilities, its domestic defence industry is established and includes companies such as Glock and Schiebel Corp, but despite this, the Austrian military continues to be underfunded and struggling with the purchasing of new equipment.”

The Austrian Ministry of Defence’s decision to award Thales with a contract to provide SquadNet tactical radios is a development and a step forward for the slow process of modernising Austria’s armed forces."

FCAS Partners Begin Sensor Design Phase for Next Generation Weapon System - The Defense Post,"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRlZmVuc2Vwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzAzLzMwL25leHQtZ2VuZXJhdGlvbi13ZWFwb24tc2Vuc29yLWRlc2lnbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Spain, Germany, and France have begun designing tactical sensors to support the Next Generation Weapon System (NGWS) program.

The initiative will focus on a suite of networked and distributed sensors, defensive aids, and attack systems (NSDAS) that will be integrated into Remote Carriers and a New Generation Fighter planned under the European Future Combat Air System (FCAS) program.

Industry partners entrusted with the effort are Indra, FCMS, and Thales.

NSDAS Design

For the NSDAS project, the team will consolidate technologies, algorithms, and functionalities according to sensor suite requirements defined in the previous NGWS phase.

The resulting solutions are expected to boost the sensor contribution, firepower, survivability, and situational awareness of future NGWS platforms.

“The main paradigm shift in this next generation air combat system is the native implementation of a System of Systems approach at all NGWS levels, so that the capabilities of the whole combination of systems will be significantly higher than the sum of the individual assets,” a statement from Thales said.

“With regards to sensors, NSDAS natively implements such features based on the disruptive cross-platform collaborative approach.”

‘Cornerstone of Success’

According to Thales, the progress accumulated throughout the NSDAS partnership will build to the NGWS’ development phase in 2028 and initial operational capability in 2040.

“A strong industrial and national joint effort will be the cornerstone of success for achieving the ambitious NGWS goals,” the company said.

“The superiority of the NGWS within the Future Combat Air System will widely depend on the unprecedented ability of its sensors network to gather, process, and distribute information.”

“FCMS, Indra and Thales’ common vision for the NSDAS solution is the basis for the success in this initiative.”"
The Pain of Double Extortion Ransomware - CPO Magazine,"Wed, 08 Mar 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNwb21hZ2F6aW5lLmNvbS9jeWJlci1zZWN1cml0eS90aGUtcGFpbi1vZi1kb3VibGUtZXh0b3J0aW9uLXJhbnNvbXdhcmUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"While ransomware operators have long targeted systems and data availability of their victims, the groups have been evolving their attack patterns to include the privacy and confidentiality of victim data as well. Attackers are increasingly pushing for double and sometimes triple extortion of their victims, threatening them with disclosure of their most sensitive data if they refuse to pay. According to a recent market study, 71% of individuals surveyed said double and triple extortion tactics have grown in popularity over the last 12 months, and 65% agree that these new threats make it tougher to refuse ransom demands.

Double extortion ransomware is when a victim’s sensitive data is both stolen from the victim and encrypted in place, giving the criminal the option of demanding two (or more) separate ransom payments. We have seen this across headlines in 2022, most recently the Medibank hack, where the company refused to pay the ransom – and the hackers leaked some very sensitive customer data.

Any organization that directly holds large amounts of sensitive data (whether from a client, supplier, or trusted partner) should consider themselves to be a tempting target for double extortion ransomware attacks. The threat of double extortion tactics is ominous. According to the 2022 Thales Data Threat Report, which surveyed nearly 2,800 respondents across 17 countries, 21% of all respondents have experienced a ransomware attack, 43% of whom were significantly impacted. Nearly half (45%) reported an increase in scope, volume, and/or severity of cyberattacks in the last twelve months. When asked to rank their top threats, more than 60% ranked malicious insiders with financial motivations among their top four.

Under such circumstances, businesses often find themselves caught between a rock and a hard place, and end up paying the ransom costs. Thales’ report found that 22% of respondents worldwide (including 24% in the US) said they have paid or would pay ransom for their data. This doesn’t come cheap – lost productivity, recovery costs and breach notification are rated as having the greatest financial impact by 19%, 18% and 16% of the respondents respectively.

Double extortion further complicates the picture for the victims because even if you pay, the attacker will still have your data and can make more demands in the future.

The pains of double extortion ransomware

A security gap?

These methods provide significant security risks for businesses of all sizes. 72% of the survey respondents believe that ransomware attacks evolve quicker than the security controls required to protect against them. Additionally, 77% of the respondents also assert that governments should do more to assist private enterprises in defending against ransomware.

Data is already in criminal hands

Already-exfiltrated sensitive data constitutes one of the most concerning trends. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) notes in an advisory that this weapon of attack circumvents conventional defenses and increases the pressure to pay. This data creates leverage for the hackers as it increasingly affects the customers’ personal information.

With privacy becoming a top priority for many citizens across the globe, revelations of this type create a wave of distrust and anger. Once the sensitive data is in the attacker’s hands, then traditional ransomware recovery mechanisms, such as offline backups and system recovery plans, are less impactful on the overall ransomware costs.

Rising ransomware costs

The various degrees of extortion are driving up the cost of ransomware because criminal groups are finding creative ways to successfully extract more money from their victims. Consider the recent case of hackers hiding malware inside fake Pokémon card NTFs to get users to click on phishing links; or of hackers stealing data though Microsoft OneNote attachments, a simple and seemingly innocent double-click away. Our most recent cause for concern is the potential threat posed by ChatGPT: a survey by BlackBerry found that over 50% of respondents consider the AI being misused to create legitimate phishing emails as a major global issue. The average ransom demands have soared to between $50 million and $70 million. While many victims wind up paying a fraction of that amount through negotiation or cyber insurance coverage, making any ransom payments help legitimize such demands and embolden attackers to continue making them. It is therefore not surprising that ransomware expenses are projected to reach $265 billion by 2031.

Preventing double extortion ransomware

Governments have taken multiple steps to help businesses mitigate the threat of ransomware attacks, with some limited success, but they are continuing to focus on the issues and providing more resources as we move forward. Some actions an enterprise can take to minimize this risk of becoming a victim of double ransomware extortion are:

Develop a ransomware recovery plan that covers not only availability of your systems and data, but also how to deal with the exfiltration and public exposure of that data.

Ensure your teams are properly prepared and resourced to securely build, deploy, and manage their systems with appropriate defenses to minimize the ability for ransomware gangs to get a foothold in the enterprise.

Invest in security awareness training to familiarize personnel with common ransomware attack vectors such as phishing, social engineering, and how to recognize and securely handle sensitive data.

Protect their sensitive data against ransomware attacks through the Discover, Protect and Control paradigm.

Another layer of defense is to ensure their sensitive data is already encrypted. In that case, even if the attacker exfiltrates the sensitive data, it will be indecipherable without the appropriate encryption keys. Moreover, it goes without saying that keeping those encryption keys in tamper-proof hardware is also critical to an enterprise’s defense strategy.

These measures should be viewed in the broader context of a Zero Trust approach to cybersecurity, where businesses should hope for the best but prepare for the worst by ensuring they have an effective ransomware plan in place. Secure human identities and machine identities are the foundation for limiting the chances of a ransomware actor gaining access to our sensitive data. In this regard, ransomware preparedness and secure key management are essential to protecting against double extortion ransomware attacks."

(Super)conducting research into a compact all-in-one antenna – Bits&Chips - Bits&Chips,"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vYml0cy1jaGlwcy5ubC9hcnRpa2VsL3N1cGVyY29uZHVjdGluZy1yZXNlYXJjaC1pbnRvLWEtY29tcGFjdC1hbGwtaW4tb25lLWFudGVubmEv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Nieke Roos

The size of a milk carton, a quantum RF antenna has the potential of replacing a wide range of traditional, much larger antennas. At the joint lab of Thales and CNRS, near Paris, Juan Trastoy and his fellow researchers are putting their award-winning innovation on the path to maturity.

Regular radio antennas can become quite sizeable. The lower the frequency you want to receive, the longer your antenna needs to be. “To be able to pick up the FM signals around 100 MHz, a car antenna has to be about 75 centimeters long – a quarter of the wavelength. Such antennas used to be straight metal rods sticking into the air; in modern vehicles, they’re made to meander around the windshield, for example,” illustrates Juan Trastoy of Thales. “Submarines communicate at much lower frequencies, tens to hundreds of kilohertzes, corresponding to waves of a few kilometers in length. This requires antennas a couple of hundred meters long.”

At the joint lab of Thales and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), near Paris, Trastoy and his colleagues are looking into alternatives of more manageable proportions. The so-called quantum RF antennas they’re working on are a very promising research avenue. Not much bigger than a milk carton, these devices can pick up a wide range of frequencies, from DC (0 Hz) to 30 GHz. The development hasn’t gone unnoticed, winning an Innovation Award at the recent Euronaval exhibition.

Little fridge

The quantum RF antenna is a receiver only, but an extremely sensitive one. “When a signal comes in, its magnetic signature is picked up as a complex voltage response, which we then convert into a frequency spectrum using a Fourier transform,” summarizes Trastoy. “Not only can we determine the constituent frequencies across a very wide band, and thus identify the type of sending device, but we can also figure out the direction the signal is coming from. And since we’re working with the magnetic component, we don’t suffer from all the distortions in the electric field, like those introduced by a boat itself.”

At the heart of the quantum RF antenna is the superconducting quantum interference device. “Such a SQUID consists of a superconducting loop a few micrometers wide, with a top and a bottom contact and a very thin non-superconducting barrier in each of the sides,” explains Trastoy. “At each barrier, a macroscopic quantum phenomenon occurs, called the Josephson effect. When a current is sent through the loop in the presence of a varying external magnetic field, the interference of both barriers causes a sinusoidal voltage response across the contacts, the period of which is inversely proportional to the loop size – the bigger the loop, the smaller the periodicity of the sine response.”

A quantum RF antenna strings together thousands of SQUIDs of different sizes to form a chain a couple of centimeters long. The devices are combined in such a way that their voltage responses all dip at zero magnetic field while canceling each other out everywhere else. “It creates what’s called an anti-peak around zero. Because of the steep slopes on either side, a tiny variation in the magnetic field will result in a big variation in voltage, allowing for a very accurate measurement of the field – essentially, it’s a highly sensitive magnetometer. SQUID arrays are also known as a superconducting quantum interference filters, or SQIFs. But they’re not filters at all, so I prefer to call them quantum antennas.”

The essential superconducting properties of the SQUIDs require refrigeration to come into force. “The loops are made of a ceramic material called yttrium barium copper oxide, YBCO, which has to be cooled to become superconducting,” Trastoy elaborates. “We don’t have to go all the way down to the milli-kelvin level using huge refrigerators as with quantum computers; for YBCO, 70-90 K suffices, so we only need a small cryostat. Enclosed in this little fridge, which we obtain from Thales Cryogenics in Eindhoven or Toulouse, the complete system is the size of a 20 cm cube.”

Ultra-precision

The potential applications are manyfold. “There’s a business unit in Thales called SIX GTS, specializing in secure information and communication systems. My colleagues there are very interested to replace different antennas aboard submarines, ships or planes with this compact all-in-one device,” Trastoy illustrates. “It would also be a good solution for drones, which can’t carry big antennas.”

The quantum RF antenna is still a work in progress, Trastoy notes. “We’ve demonstrated the principle and built a couple of pretty decent prototypes – I’d put it between technology readiness levels 3 and 4. Being a part of Thales Research & Technology, the corporate research organization, we typically go to TRL 5, at which point the work is transferred to the business units, like SIX GTS or Defense Mission Systems, DMS. They take it from there, all the way to TRL 9. Our total horizon for getting technology mature enough to be included in a product is about ten years.”

One of the main challenges is the production of the SQUID array. “The thousands of superconducting loops and the non-superconducting barriers inside need to respond similarly under all circumstances. The more SQUIDs are out of sync, the bigger the noise. Bearing in mind that the loops are a few microns wide and the barriers are even smaller, measuring only a couple of tens of nanometers, you can imagine the ultra-precision with which they need to be manufactured. To make things even more challenging, YBCO also isn’t the easiest material to process.”

The SQUIDs are fabricated with electron beam lithography. “We use tools from the semiconductor industry, but we’ve adapted the machines and the processes to achieve an extremely homogeneous result across the whole chain,” says Trastoy. “We’re working to further increase the fabrication maturity and achieve the best homogeneity and repeatability with standard semiconductor production equipment and techniques.”

Curiosity

Trastoy’s group is also researching other applications of superconducting materials, including actual filters. “Because of their very low resistance, superconductors have very low dissipation. That makes them very useful for creating resonators. When such a resonator is placed in the proximity of a special electromagnetic transmission line, called a stripline, its resonating frequency is removed from the passing RF signal. The result is a real band-rejection filter, which can be used, for example, to separate overlapping signals from a radar and a satcom system, so that both can be used simultaneously. This technology is more mature, TRL 5, and has in fact already been transferred to Thales DMS.”

“Being able to conduct such advanced research in such a top-notch lab is what makes my job at Thales so much fun,” concludes Trastoy. “I have the financial resources, the facilities and the freedom, within my domain of expertise, to go where my curiosity takes me.”

New satellite communication consortium formed - Advanced Television,"Wed, 01 Mar 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vYWR2YW5jZWQtdGVsZXZpc2lvbi5jb20vMjAyMy8wMy8wMS9uZXctc2F0ZWxsaXRlLWNvbW11bmljYXRpb24tY29uc29ydGl1bS1mb3JtZWQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"ST Engineering iDirect’s EU Satcom Centre of Excellence, ST Engineering iDirect Europe, located in Sint-Niklaas, Belgium, which specialises in the development of ground segment technology and equipment for the EU, is leading a consortium of leading satellite industry players to develop the European Protected Waveform (EPW) for the European Defence Fund (EDF).

The aim is to support satellite communications, high data rates, security, resilience, information assurance and link efficiency technologies which are inextricably linked. The consortium is targeting military operations which are becoming more complex as conflict areas grow more dispersed on a global scale, with a growing need to support a diversity of on-the-move, on-the-pause and fixed platforms on land, in the air and at sea over both GEO and multi-orbit satellite constellations.

The EPW is built around four cornerstones: agile, secure, affordable and interoperable satellite communications. It will be developed in tandem with current and future requirements for military and secure operations considering upcoming disruptive technologies, EU initiatives such as GovSatCom and IRIS2, and multi-layered security and resiliency solutions.

Through the EDF initiative, the investment for an interoperable and affordable secure defence-grade EPW becomes accessible to small and mid-sized European nations alongside large EU nations seeking to embrace today’s and future challenges related to increased throughput demand over satellite, joint operations, mobility and new security threats. The new consortium addresses the growing demand for European autonomy linked to defence and space capabilities.

“The development of waveforms has always been part of our company’s DNA, and we aim to seek the best balance between efficiency, agility and security,” said Koen Willems, VP, EU Programmes and Government Relations. “With their combined knowledge and experience, bringing together these key players under the EPW consortium will equip European countries with highly reliable, seamless satellite communications to ensure that they can communicate with confidence and security no matter where they operate.”

Comprising satcom companies and academia from 12 nations across Europe, the consortium includes: Airbus D&S, Antwerp Space, Amphinicy, Belgian Royal Military Academy, CTG Celestia, Eutelsat, Elital, GISS, Indra, NeoSat, Quadsat, Lasting, Leonardo, LuxGovSat, NLR, OHB, ST Engineering iDirect Europe, Telespazio, Thales Alenia Space and Thales Six. Members will work together over a period of 39 months to design the waveform and accompanying technologies for resilient and secure satellite communications. The project kicked off in January 2023 at the EU Commission

Headquarters, with representation from the EU as well as national and military delegates from participating EU nations."

Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 is the first chip to use iSIM - Android Authority,"Wed, 01 Mar 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZHJvaWRhdXRob3JpdHkuY29tL3F1YWxjb21tLWlzaW0tc25hcGRyYWdvbi04LWdlbi0yLTMyOTEzMTYv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Qualcomm

TL;DR Qualcomm has partnered with Thales to bake iSIM or Integrated SIM capabilities right inside the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 SoC.

The new form factor makes swapping carrier services much smoother and faster.

iSIMs also occupy significantly less space inside phones than eSIMs and physical SIM slots.

eSIMs are a great way to circumvent the need for a physical SIM card. Having eSIM capabilities on a phone can also be very helpful when you’re traveling and have to use switch carriers on the go. But Qualcomm now has tech that could make eSIMs obsolete.

The chipmaker has baked iSIM or Integrated SIM functionality right inside the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 platform. The new form factor is highly attractive as it makes swapping services much smoother and faster.

Unlike eSIMs, iSIMs are located on the main processor of a phone. This means the tech takes up much lesser space inside the device compared to physical SIM slots or even eSIMs.

Thales

According to Qualcomm, this results in lower costs and improved efficiency for smartphone makers. It also allows manufacturers to create smaller, more compact devices.

Moreover, iSIMs draw less power compared to eSIMs, which makes them ideal for IoT devices, as per Thales, the mobile device security company that has partnered with Qualcomm to develop the tech. They also support the same high-standard security protections as the latest generation of eSIMs.

Qualcomm predicts that global iSIM shipments will reach 300 million by 2027, representing 19% of all eSIM shipments.

“Alongside the increasingly popular eSIM, the Thales 5G iSIM gives device makers and mobile operators even greater freedom to offer their customers effortless over-the-air connectivity, and more exciting and accessible product designs,” said Guillaume Lafaix, vice president of embedded products at Thales Mobile and Connectivity Solutions.

Qualcomm hasn’t confirmed whether existing Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 phones, like the Galaxy S23 series, are already iSIM capable. However, Thales has said that iSIMs will be first made available in high-end smartphones and eventually reach entry-level and mid-range smartphones, as well as wearables.

The new technology is set to replace the conventional SIM card and is embedded directly into the phone's main processor starting with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, which eliminates the need for a dedicated chip.

The technology provides the same digital sign-ups and security benefits as the current eSIMs but with added advantages. The most notable of these advantages is the iSIM technology supports the same remote provisioning standard as the eSIM, which means that mobile phone carriers won't have to upgrade their systems to support iSIM-based devices.

Also, with the extra space, phone manufacturers can leverage it to include bigger batteries and other essential components. It's not yet clear whether phone manufacturers will pass on any savings from the reduced footprint to customers.

“The world’s first security certification of an iSIM by the GSMA follows several years of intense development work by Qualcomm Technologies and Thales. Alongside the increasingly popular eSIM, the Thales 5G iSIM gives device makers and mobile operators even greater freedom to offer their customers effortless over-the-air connectivity, and more exciting and accessible product designs,” Guillaume Lafaix, VP of embedded products at Thales Mobile said.

This transition to digital SIMs has already begun with many smartphones now featuring eSIM support, with the latest iPhone 14 and 14 Pro models not having physical SIM trays at all in the United States.

While the companies haven't yet revealed which phone models will have the iSIM technology, the new feature could encourage more manufacturers to use digital SIMs as it is easier to implement.

Factory's big jobs boost - Yarrawonga Chronicle,"Wed, 01 Mar 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhcnJhd29uZ2FjaHJvbmljbGUuY29tLmF1L25ld3MvZmFjdG9yeXMtYmlnLWpvYnMtYm9vc3Qv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The potential substantial increase was strongly indicated last week because of the partnership formed between Lockheed Martin Australia and Thales.

The official opening of a new Lockheed Martin Australia office at the Mulwala facility took place last Thursday, February 23.

As part of the Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance (GWEO) Enterprise, Lockheed Martin Australia signed an agreement with Thales to lease the office at the Mulwala Munition’s facility.

The occasion recognises Lockheed Martin Australia’s partnership with Thales Australia, the legacy of the Mulwala Munitions Facility site and the significance of the occasion for Lockheed Martin in Australia, expanding its footprint and capability for advancing in-country production.

Trading as Australian Munitions, Thales Australia currently manages the Commonwealth-owned facility at Mulwala and has made a significant investment in state-of-the-art advanced manufacturing equipment at the site.

In front of a building which has had many uses since the factory’s establishment in 1942, including the drawing office involving technical drawings for maintenance machinery and buildings, which is now the Lockheed Martin Australian office, were Australian Munitions team leaders and supervisors with Lockheed Martin leaders and Capability Acquisition and Sustainment Group (CASG), Department of Defence personnel.

The Mulwala site is the first co-located presence for Lockheed Martin Australia.

At last Thursday’s opening, Lockheed Martin Australia’s Director of Programs, Strategic Capabilities Office, Missiles and Fire Control James Heading said the increased workforce initially would be a transient population.

“The numbers could become a permanent 30 to 50 employees in the 18-24 month period rising to up to 200 over a five-year horizon,” he told the Yarrawonga Chronicle.

“Employees would include classified, unclassified and senior engineers.

“Consultation is required with the US Government before production detail is finalised and our Federal Government’s response to the Defence Strategy Review will be integral to the scope of work at Mulwala. I expect that response to be March or early April.”

Headquartered in Canberra, Lockheed Martin Australia is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation. The company employs more than 1,200 people in Australia working on a wide range of major programs spanning the aerospace, defence and civil sectors.

Lockheed Martin Australia is a Department of Defence strategic industry partner in support of the Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance Enterprise.

The company’s technologies have contributed to the realisation of Australia’s national interests for over 70 years, and its vision for the future of security aims to do the same for the decades to come.

Chief Executive Officer Thales Australia and New Zealand, Jeff Connolly, said the official opening is an important step forward to achieving the Australian’s Government’s Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance objectives.

“Thales is the main provider of explosive ordnance and propellant in Australia,” the CEO said.

“We are committed to our partnership with Lockheed Martin and the development of the high-performance propellants and explosives for warheads, solid fuel rocket motor manufacturing and associated research and development essential to achieving a sovereign guided weapons capability for the Australian Defence Force.”

Thales currently employs some 650 skilled staff (380 at Mulwala and 270 at Benalla) to manufacture munitions systems for the ADF and allied forces.

“Thales works with over 500 Australian small and medium enterprises and a large range of weapons systems, primed to ensure the ADF receives the locally manufactured munitions they need,” Mr Connolly said.

Vice President of the Australia Defence Strategic Capabilities Office at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, Ken Kota, is positive about the future enterprise.

“We are working to accelerate the connectivity of our platforms at Lockheed Martin, with a view to encompassing the greater defence ecosystem,” he said.

“We will collaborate to tie together our platforms and systems with those of other manufacturers, across generations. This ‘network effect’ for our partners will provide greater returns in capability and efficiency than any individual system could on its own.

“We are actively engaging with suppliers, partners and small businesses to give them every opportunity to partner with Lockheed Martin Australia to deliver world-class capability to the GWEO enterprise.”

Tim Cahill, Executive Vice President, Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, Tim Cahill welcomed the establishment of the new office.

“Lockheed Martin is expanding – we recently opened a dedicated Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance Enterprise (GWEO) program office in Canberra, and today, in partnership with Thales Australia, we have added a new office in Mulwala to support the development and production of various manufacturing activities in Australia,” he said.

Vice President, Operations, Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control Orlando, Florida, Pat Sunderlin commented: “Lockheed Martin, together with our industry and defence partners are paving the way for the accelerated development and production of guided weapons capabilities.”

Great impressions of Mulwala

The Thales Australia/Lockheed Martin Australia partnership has been years in the making with discussions, meetings and visits. What exists at Mulwala greatly impressed Lockheed Martin.

“There’s no more perfect place than this, there’s no more perfect time to do this business,” Mr Sunderlin said.

“There is the need for this capability, for the peace and safety of all our nations and for economic capability.

“I’ve seen the workforce passion here and employees understanding their jobs. They do it really well and safely. It was very important when we were making decisions.

“It’s a partnership – better to be together than alone. Lockheed Martin is open for business – we’re here to stay. “

TDSI eyeing to supply tactical radios to PHL military - BusinessWorld Online,"Sun, 12 Mar 2023 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ3b3JsZG9ubGluZS5jb20vdGhlLW5hdGlvbi8yMDIzLzAzLzEyLzUxMDA5NC90ZHNpLWV5ZWluZy10by1zdXBwbHktdGFjdGljYWwtcmFkaW9zLXRvLXBobC1taWxpdGFyeS_SAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5id29ybGRvbmxpbmUuY29tL3RoZS1uYXRpb24vMjAyMy8wMy8xMi81MTAwOTQvdGRzaS1leWVpbmctdG8tc3VwcGx5LXRhY3RpY2FsLXJhZGlvcy10by1waGwtbWlsaXRhcnkvP2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"UNITED States-headquartered Thales Defense & Security, Inc. (TDSI) is eyeing to supply tactical radios to the Philippine military as part of its business expansion in the country.

Ron Huther, TDSI director for international business, said the company currently has a local partner that provides tactical radios to the Philippine National Police (PNP) and is now eyeing to find a local distributor for the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP).

“We would love to get a footprint in with the military, the AFP,” he said at the sidelines of the Trade Winds ASEAN 2023 trade promotion program in Makati City organized by the US Embassy in the Philippines.

TDSI’s current local distributor is Scan Marine, Inc., which has supplied tactical radios to the police for five years.

“Scan Marine is a good company, but it is a complicated market. Maybe they are good with the PNP but somebody else might be good with the special forces. That is what we are going to look at, to see if there are other partners in this country that can help us,” Mr. Huther said.

TDSI’s primary customers include the US Army and US Special Forces, while the company’s main products include its handheld tactical radio, satellite communications, and battery chargers.

“We provide support primarily for the US Army, US Special Forces. Those are our primary customers. What we’ve done is we’ve taken this great product and we’ve made them exportable. We’ve exported radios to almost 40 countries around the world,” Mr. Huther said.

He claimed that TDSI’s products will allow the AFP to have “interoperability” with the US military.

“The AFP would have a degree of interoperability if there was a crisis in this part of the world, which it could be. There is a lot of tension in this part of the world. There would be a degree of interoperability with US forces, US special forces, and coalition forces,” he said.

The TDSI executive said they are advocating for open competition and the company is prepared for the bidding procedures in the Philippines.

TDSI, based in Clarksburg, Maryland, is a subsidiary of French multinational company Thales Group, which has business interests in aerospace, defense and security, and transportation. The Thales Group has presence across 68 countries and is based in Paris, France. — Revin Mikhael D. Ochave"
Thales Australia Completes Lithgow Arms Factory Expansion and Announces New Rifle - - The Firearm Blog,"Mon, 20 Mar 2023 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWZpcmVhcm1ibG9nLmNvbS9ibG9nLzIwMjMvMDMvMjAvdGhhbGVzLWF1c3RyYWxpYS1jb21wbGV0ZXMtbGl0aGdvdy1hcm1zLWZhY3RvcnktZXhwYW5zaW9uLWFubm91bmNlcy1uZXctcmlmbGUv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Earlier this month Thales Australia announced the completion of construction on a new advanced manufacturing building at Lithgow Arms. The new facility features state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment and is intended to foster ‘collaboration across research institutions, SME partners, and key industrial partners to create the soldier systems and small arms of the future’. Thales Australia invested $6.5 million (AUD) in the project with funding also coming from the New South Wales Government via a $1.12 million (AUD) grant from the NSW Regional Job Creation Fund.

Thales Australia’s Vice President Land Julie Bown said “Thales Australia is proud of our stewardship of this critical industrial capability that has supported the ADF and allies for more than a century. In an uncertain world it is vital that Australia maintains its sovereign manufacturing capability to prepare for all contingencies and our investment at Lithgow reflects our commitment to continue providing advanced capability that’s made in Australia.”

The completion of the building comes as Lithgow Arms continues the development of a new automatic rifle for the Australian armed forces. Based on designs from Melbourne-based Wedgetail Industries, the new rifle appears to be a departure from Lithgow Arms’ F90 bullpup platform, however, Wedgetail have previously showcased, at LandForces2022, a prototype 6.8mm chambered F90. In December, Thales Australia and Wedgetail Industries signed an agreement that will see the Wedgetail-developed rifle manufactured at Lithgow if it is selected as part of the Australian Army’s upcoming rifle tender.

Currently referred to as the Australian Combat Assault Rifle (ACAR). According to Thales Australia “Wedgetail and Thales Australia’s Lithgow Arms initiated a design and development effort on the new weapon system in early 2022. The work was undertaken at Lithgow Arms’ C3 – a small arms and weapons systems ‘incubator’ established on site at the Lithgow facility designed to assist and bring on board small-to-medium enterprises (SME) in the defence industry.”

The ACAR is an AR platform-based weapon with variants chambered in 5.56x45mm, .300BLK and 7.62x51mm developed. Matt Duquemin, Thales Australia’s Director Integrated Weapons and Sensors, said, “We are proud to work together with Wedgetail – helping develop and grow the innovation and ingenuity of Australian SMEs by bringing down costly barriers to entry often experienced by Australian companies in the defence industry”.

The ACAR is described as being at the pre-production stage and ready for full-rate production. Unsurprisingly a version chambered in the new US Next Generation Squad Weapon cartridge, 6.8x51mm, has also been developed and is undergoing final qualification testing. Wedgetail have already confirmed that an Australian-manufactured version of the round has been developed. The ACAR is in a development spiral to refine with weapon, develop variants required by the Australian military and integrate it with accessories such as optics and night vision devices.

The Australian Defense Force is currently undertaking its Lethality System Project – LAND 159. The first Tranche of which saw new sniper systems and close combat weapons selected back in October 2022. Tranche 2, due for consideration in 2024/2025, will see the selection of new ‘Close Combatant Assault Rifle, Machine Guns, Direct Fire Support Weapons’. With a strong showing from the SIG Sauer-Aquaterro partnership in Tranche 1, it can be expected that Lithgow Arms’ ACAR will face competition from SIG’s XM7."
