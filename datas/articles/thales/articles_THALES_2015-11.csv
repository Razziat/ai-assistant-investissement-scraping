Bangladesh Taps Thales Alenia To Build 1st Telecom Satellite - SpaceNews,"Wed, 11 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9iYW5nbGFkZXNoLXRhcHMtdGhhbGVzLWFsZW5pYS1zcGFjZS10by1idWlsZC1maXJzdC10ZWxlY29tLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS — The government of Bangladesh on Nov. 11 contracted with manufacturer Thales Alenia Space to build the Bangabandhu-1 telecommunications satellite, ushering a new nation into the large group of Asian countries with their own national satellite capacity.

France- an Italy-based Thales Alenia Space bested a field of competitors that included Orbital ATK of the United States; MDA Corp. of Canada, teamed with its Space Systems/Loral builder in the United States; and China Great Wall Industry Corp. of Beijing.

The contract, valued at $248 million, includes the construction of the 3,500-kilogram Bangabandhu-1, its launch — likely aboard a European Ariane 5 rocket — and the associated ground segment including satellite control and network operations centers. Loan guarantees have been provided by the French export credit agency, Coface.

The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) said the project’s goal is to launch the satellite on Dec. 16, 2017, a national holiday. Thales Alenia Space said it is aiming for a late-2017 launch.

Bangladesh has had difficulty securing an orbital slot for its satellite and ultimately purchased rights to 119.1 degrees east from the international Intersputnik organization of Moscow. The 15-year, renewable lease is valued at about $27.5 million and was concluded in January.

Bangladesh has until late 2018 to place the satellite into its intended orbital position according to International Telecommunication Union regulations, although the regulator has been known to extend deadlines if nations have demonstrated they are building a satellite for the relevant slots.

Bangabandhu-1, based on Thales Alenia Space’s Spacebus 4000B2 platform, will carry 26 Ku- and 14 C-band transponders to provide telecommunications services in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, the Philippines and Indonesia.

BTRC officials have said owning the satellite will save Bangladesh some $14 million spent annually on leases of commercial bandwidth. They intend to use half the satellite’s capacity for domestic purposes, and to create a private company to commercialize the remaining capacity in the region.

“The contract … marks a major turning point in the history of Bangladesh, not only in reducing the digital divide, but also generating business development and creating jobs,” BTRC Bangabandhu Project Director Golam Razzaque said in a statement."
Thales Group unveils Spy'Ranger mini-drone - UPI News,"Wed, 18 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVwaS5jb20vRGVmZW5zZS1OZXdzLzIwMTUvMTEvMTgvVGhhbGVzLUdyb3VwLXVudmVpbHMtU3B5UmFuZ2VyLW1pbmktZHJvbmUvNTMxMTQ0Nzg1NDU1OC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"PARIS, Nov. 18 (UPI) -- Thales Group formally introduced its latest surveillance and reconnaissance mini-drone, the Spy'Ranger, on Wednesday.

The company says the new tactical unmanned aerial vehicle is a response to an increase in battlefield anti-drone measures, and the need to ensure tactical reconnaissance vehicles have high security and survivability capabilities.

""Surveillance and reconnaissance drones provide a tactical advantage that hasn't been seen since the deployment of radars by the Allies during the Second World War,"" Thales Optronics Solutions Vice President Jean-Pascal Arrou-Vignod said in a statement. ""This is why anti-drone countermeasures are a growing threat that make more robust drone platforms a priority.""

Spy'Ranger was designed in collaboration by a team of European UAV developers from both Thales and French aerospace SME, Aviation Design. The design follows a decade of experimentation on micro and mini UAV systems used by the French armed forces, and is fitted to build on endurance.

The UAV was developed with an electric-powered airframe, command-and-control software, and a tactical datalink. It also comes with an advanced gimbal used to optimize frontline and range, enabling the craft to maintain its camera and sensor equipment on its target even if the aircraft is maneuvering past the limits of its airframe. Most UAVs are unable to follow their targets while performing sudden or violent movements.

Spy'Ranger is designed to be deployed with Spy'C automatic command-and-control software already in use by French land forces, and is capable of operating in extreme environments. The UAV is interoperable with France's multi-sensor image interpetation and dissemination system to enhance intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance operations.

""Spy'Ranger has been designed from first principles to remain combat effective in all tactical scenarios. It once again provides armed forces and security forces with an insurmountable tactical advantage, the ability to see the enemy wherever they are, at all times, no matter what they do to try to neutralize it,"" Arrou-Vignod added."

VIDEO: Thales reworking IFE remote after execution disappoints - Runway Girl Network,"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vcnVud2F5Z2lybG5ldHdvcmsuY29tLzIwMTUvMTEvdGhhbGVzLXJld29ya2luZy1pZmUtcmVtb3RlLWFmdGVyLXByZW1pdW0tZXhlY3V0aW9uLWRpc2FwcG9pbnRzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"As inflight entertainment screens in premium aircraft cabins grow larger and passengers sit even further away from them, vendors have had to come up with new ways to interact with the system from a distance. What was once just a rudimentary remote control with a few buttons has now become a second screen experience onto itself. However, a certain deployment has seen varied success.

Thales, a long-time provider of in-seat IFE, has been shifting interaction completely onto its tethered remote control on aircraft like the British Airways Boeing 787-9 in first class, and Qatar Airways 787-8 in business class. The main screen, up to 23″ in BA’s case, is relegated to content display only, with absolutely no menu system whatsoever.

The idea was to have passengers interact with the system in a way they are familiar with; a smartphone-like device with capacitive screen that mimics everyday smartphone use. The execution, however, leaves a lot to be desired, as the author learned on board the BA 787-9. The small handset often exhibits annoying input lag, awkward performance, and truncated text, while the large screen goes unused.

“Yes, in hindsight, I can see some of the flaws in that thinking process, and I myself struggled with using it at times, and we see people struggling, so we have a revision plan…” said David Pook, director of IFE marketing at Thales InFlyt Experience at the Dubai Air Show.

Pook described the design process, and the multitude of input methods Thales experimented with. “Obviously, direct touch is the most intuitive simple thing to do,” he remarked, nothing that screens are typically now out of arm’s reach in premium cabins. “We had other methodologies that we were looking at, like just use it as a remote control, but the problem with that was people were having a hard time with the buttons, figuring out ‘how do I touch this and know where I’m touching?’” Another idea was to simply mirror the main display on the remote, but working with such vastly different screen sizes did not pan out.

While the graphical user interface Thales settled on for the remote is adequate, the lackluster performance is actually partly the victim of an incredibly lengthy development and certification cycle that often plague this space. The current remote Thales has deployed contains a small 3.8″ screen and single core processor, all running on Android 2.3. Translated into smartphone terms, that would equate to an Android smartphone produced in late 2010, half a decade ago. Nobody would ever use it in 2015.

Thankfully, Thales is already hard at work on its next generation remote. The specs jump to a much more modern 5″ 1080p display with quad-core processor, powered by Android 4.4 (released in late 2013). Using accelerometers and gyroscopes (both included in modern smartphones), the new remote acts as virtual controller, where motion is relative and controls what the passenger sees on the main screen, much like a Nintendo Wii controller. I was able to understand the gestures and overall in no time, and the performance bump was legitimate.

All of this sounds like a big improvement, but there’s a catch. The upgraded remote won’t be made available to airline customers until Q2 2017, with Qatar Airways launching the product on the Airbus A350. While the hardware is certainly more capable this time around, the underlying operating system of the remote will be four years outdated. Additionally, due to the larger screen size, the updated remote is not “plug and play” with existing systems, though it is retrofittable.

Although Thales had good intentions, this is a prime example of how inflight entertainment and connectivity systems continue to lag behind consumer grade technology.

Radio bug to keep new Iridium satellites grounded until April – Spaceflight Now - Spaceflight Now,"Tue, 10 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VmbGlnaHRub3cuY29tLzIwMTUvMTEvMTAvcmFkaW8tYnVnLXRvLWtlZXAtbmV3LWlyaWRpdW0tc2F0ZWxsaXRlcy1ncm91bmRlZC11bnRpbC1hcHJpbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The first launch for Iridium’s next-generation mobile communications fleet has been pushed back four months — from December until April — to resolve a technical problem inside the spacecraft’s Ka-band communications payload.

The announcement Oct. 29 means Iridium will miss a long-targeted timetable to begin launching the Iridium Next constellation in 2015.

Matt Desch, Iridium’s CEO, told investment analysts the problem is rooted inside Ka-band transmit-receive modules made by ViaSat and delivered to spacecraft prime contractor Thales Alenia Space.

“The primary cause of this problem is not that complicated, nor is it difficult to fix,” Desch said, adding that Thales discovered the issue during testing after assembling the component.

“The specific issue is an RF (radio frequency) spur that occurs at certain temperatures, which could create performance problems in the Ka-band downlinks to our Earth stations,” Desch said. “To address this spur, a resistor needs to be changed in the circuitry, and then the component can be re-installed on the first two (spacecraft) and certified through another around of testing.”

The problem means the first pair of satellites will not ship to their launch site in Russia in November, but in March, to begin a 30-day processing campaign leading up to liftoff.

The first two Iridium Next satellites are set to launch on a Dnepr rocket marketed by ISC Kosmotras, a Moscow-based company with joint Russian-Ukrainian ownership. The Dnepr is a converted Soviet-era R-36M missile — also known by the Western designation SS-18 “Satan” — developed in Ukraine.

The delay means a Spanish satellite will take Iridium’s slot in the Dnepr manifest in December, according to Desch, who did not identify the spacecraft. It is likely Spain’s Paz radar Earth observation satellite.

Desch said the rest of the test program for the Iridium Next satellites is going well. A “protoflight” version of the Iridium Next spacecraft bus recently completed a thermal-vacuum test at Thales’ facility in Cannes, France, in a final milestone leading to the full flight qualification of the Iridium Next satellites in December, Thales said in a statement.

“With the rest of the satellite qualification going smoothly, it is disappointing that this one compoment of Ka-band hardware is causing us another delay,” Desch said. “This is particularly frustrating in that it should have been caught and resolved much earlier in development.

“Regardless, having high-quality satellites and a high-performing Iridium Next constellation is our primary objective, and … we have no interest in launching satellites before they’re ready.”

Thales Alenia Space is leading development of 81 Iridium Next satellites, and Orbital ATK is in charge of spacecraft assembly, integration and testing at a facility in Gilbert, Arizona.

“I’m glad we found this issue on the ground so that it can be corrected,” Desch said in a quarterly earnings call. “We will not press to launch before satellites are ready, but in light of previous program delays, Thales Alenia knows quite clearly my disappointment that the date of the first launch has moved out once again.”

Thales officials said satellite production at Orbital ATK’s Arizona plant is on schedule, with 10 spacecraft currently in the integration flow.

Desch said “Thales has committed significant additional resources to our project and has a credible plan for high-rate satellite production, but they still have execute on this timeline in order for us to hit ours.”

“Iridium Next is a strategic program for Thales Alenia Space, and its success is a top priority for the company,” said Jean-Loïc Galle, CEO of Thales Alenia Space. “Validating such a complex system and qualifying the satellites was a daunting technical challenge, but one that was met by our teams, who are now wholly focused on delivering the satellites.”

Desch said Iridium engineers and insurers want four months of in-orbit tests of the first two next-generation spacecraft before committing further satellites for launch.

Seventy Iridium Next satellites are on contract for launches on seven SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, beginning as soon as August 2016. SpaceX will need to fly Iridium satellites from Vandenberg every other month for the $3 billion next-generation fleet to be operational as scheduled by the end of 2017.

“Based on the measures taken by Thales Alenia Space, in-house and with our partners, along with an accelerated production rate, we are firmly convinced that with the first launch taking place in April 2016, and a second launch four months later, the entire constellation will be deployed by the end of 2017, as initially planned,” Galle said in a statement.

Iridium plans to launch 72 of the 81 new spacecraft, deploying the platforms into six orbital planes, while keeping nine satellites as ground spares. Each satellite will orbit 485 miles, or 780 kilometers, above Earth, and weigh nearly 1,900 pounds, or 860 kilograms, at launch.

The satellites add modernized services to Iridium’s offering, such as 4G-equivalent telephone connectivity, and replace the company’s aging fleet, most of which launched in the late 1990s.

The ELISA electronic intelligence micro-satellite demonstrator will serve as a basis for the development of the CERES spacecraft system. Image courtesy of Astrium. The objective of the CERES satellite system is to detect, locate and characterise electromagnetic signals on the ground from enemy's radio communications systems and radars. Image courtesy of Thales.

CERES (CapacitÉ de Renseignement Électromagnétique Spatiale) satellite system, the first operational space-based signal intelligence (SIGINT) system of the French Ministry of Defence, is scheduled for launch in 2020.

CERES is a constellation of three satellites that are intended to detect, locate and characterise electromagnetic signals on the ground, emitted by enemy radio communications systems and radars, to provide space-based early-warning and ballistic missile detection capabilities for the French Armed Forces. The satellites will also help to improve situational awareness and security in the battlefield.

Airbus Defence and Space, Thales Airborne Systems and Thales Alenia Space are the prime contractors for the CERES satellite system. French defence procurement agency Direction générale de l’armement (DGA) will provide project management services for the CERES programme.

CERES satellite system development

The French DGA notified an agreement for the design and development of CERES military electronic intelligence mission in 2013. The project received an official go-ahead in March 2014.

In March 2015, DGA awarded a contract to Thales and Airbus Defence and Space for the development and implementation of the CERES SIGINT system, including the space segment, user ground segment and SIGINT payloads. As part of the contractual agreement, the companies will also provide thorough-life support for the satellite system.

Airbus Defence and Space will build the space segment composed of three CERES satellites, while Thales will supply bus/platform, mission payloads and user ground segment under a subcontract to Airbus Defence and Space. The French space agency National Centre for Space Studies (CNES), in partnership with the DGA, will procure launch services and ground control segment.

The CERES programme is valued at €450m ($493.25m) and is part of the 2014-2019 Military Planning Law.

Development of the CERES is based on the ELISA (electronic intelligence) and ESSAIM (communications intelligence) micro-satellite demonstrators, which were launched in December 2011 and December 2004 respectively.

Payloads and operation of CERES satellites

The all-weather CERES satellites will carry signals intelligence payloads to detect high-frequency radio waves and other electronic signals. All information captured by the payloads will be down-linked for processing by the associated ground segment.

The CERES constellation will be located in low Earth orbit at an inclination between 70° and 80°, to detect and locate electromagnetic signals simultaneously at different time intervals. The satellites will be positioned in a triangle shape (satellite 1 / satellite 2, satellite 2 / satellite 3, and satellite 1 / satellite 3) in close proximity to each other. They will be powered by deployable solar arrays and batteries.

Ground control systems for spacecraft operation

The ground control unit consists of two systems, one to command and control the spacecraft and the other to perform mission planning and data processing.

EliteBus platform for civil missions

The CERES satellite system is based on Thales Alenia Space’s flexible and high-performance EliteBus platform, which is designed to carry payloads weighing up to 550kg with 2,500W of power to low Earth orbit or medium Earth orbit.

The EliteBus platform’s applications include military, Earth observation, telecommunications, navigation and other civil missions. It is compatible with launchers such as Atlas, Dnepr, Falcon and Soyuz."

Etihad selects Thales HUD for its new Airbus A350 XWB - ZAWYA,"Mon, 09 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnphd3lhLmNvbS9lbi9wcmVzcy1yZWxlYXNlL2V0aWhhZC1zZWxlY3RzLXRoYWxlcy1odWQtZm9yLWl0cy1uZXctYWlyYnVzLWEzNTAteHdiLWViOGZhbWhw0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Dubai Air show On the opening day of the Dubai Airshow, Thales announces the selection by Etihad of its dual configuration Head Up Displays (HUD) for the first 12 aircraft of its new Airbus A350XWB fleet scheduled to be delivered from December 2017 by Airbus.

A total of 62 A350XWBs have been ordered by Etihad, the first 12 aircraft will be delivered by December 2017

The dual-configuration (pilot/copilot) HUD is a newer development to the more traditional, pilot only HUD configuration. It is gaining traction in the commercial market as it improves situational awareness and efficiency of both pilot and copilot, by giving them the same level of eyes-out instrument visibility during critical phases of the flight, especially in low visibility and adverse weather conditions, thus improving safety.

The group already equips single configuration HUDs on Qatar Airways A380s this is the first dual-configuration HUD in the Middle East, which both strengthens Thales's position in the Middle East for this segment. It also closely follows the announcement in September, of the first ever contract for a dual-configuration system the group ever signed, with China Southern Airlines for their entire fleet of 30 Airbus A320s.

The interest by many global airlines to equip their newest aircraft with a HUD configuration is growing at an unprecedented pace. With most new build long-haul aircraft coming off assembly lines equipped with a HUD, Civil Aviation Authorities such as the Chinese CAAC, have made a basic single-configuration HUD, mandatory on all aircraft they register. Thales is amongst the world's leading HUD developers and has been selected as the supplier of choice for HUDs on all Airbus aircraft.

About Thales

Thales is a global technology leader for the Aerospace, Transport, Defence and Security markets. With 61,000 employees in 56 countries, Thales reported sales of €13 billion in 2014. With over 20,000 engineers and researchers, Thales has a unique capability to design and deploy equipment, systems and services to meet the most complex security requirements. Its unique international footprint allows it to work closely with its customers all over the world.

· Thales will equip the first 12 A350XWB aircraft of Etihad's fleet with a dual-configuration HUD.

· HUDs are becoming a crucial optional component. The dual-configuration benefits to pilot/copilot situational awareness and efficiency.

· Thales is HUD supplier of choice on Airbus and strengthens an already global footprint with second dual HUD contract signed over past several months.

""We have placed considerable efforts in making our HUD the most perfectly tailored system to the needs of pilots. The growth of our footprint worldwide and the choice by Etihad, one of the world's most successful airlines to deploy a dual-configuration across its newest fleet, is a proof of success of this system, and of the benefits it brings to pilots.""

The opulence conceals a rot within the household. Dad has been playing fast and loose with his hedge fund, and soon his 17-year-old son, Jean, is taking the bus to school instead of the customary car with driver.

In his first feature film, Mr. Barbosa blends tales of a coming-of-age and a burgeoning class consciousness, and never loses sympathy for Jean (Thales Cavalcanti). The oafish adolescent sinks in social status at school, owing money left and right, like his father (Marcello Novaes, a soap opera star whose looks help express the superficiality of this well-drawn family’s stability). Jean’s mother (Suzana Pires) must stoop to selling makeup to bring in money; Jean distracts himself with a flirtatious maid and, more age-appropriately, a quick-witted teenager (Bruna Amaya) he meets on the bus.

Mr. Barbosa and his cinematographer, Pedro Sotero, choose smooth, colorful surfaces and capacious compositions for their film, ensconcing Jean in a world that his family may no longer be able to afford. Mr. Cavalcanti, new to the screen, has a natural manner, by turns tentative and blustering. That offsets the prim confidence of some of Mr. Barbosa’s grand design (which draws from his personal experience). Through his naïveté, Jean illuminates the world around him."
BEL-Thales JV begins production of radars - Governance Now,"Mon, 16 Nov 2015 08:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvdmVybmFuY2Vub3cuY29tL25ld3MvcHN1L2JlbC10aGFsZXMtanYtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1yYWRhcnPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The joint venture formed by Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) and Thales, for the manufacture of civil and military radars, has started production for the Indian Air Force.



BEL, the Navratna PSU, holds a 74 per cent stake in the joint venture and the rest is held by the French company. Even as BEL has manufactured radars for the military, Thales’ main strengths are in systems engineering, integration and testing. The joint venture is currently focusing on air traffic management radars for both civilian and defence markets.



Antoine Caput, vice-president and Country Director, Thales, said the joint venture company, BEL-Thales Systems Limited, that was incorporated in August last year, has had an encouraging start to the partnership. “The eventual aim of the joint venture is to become a centre of excellence, offering solutions in line with the government’s ‘Make in India’ approach,” he told BusinessLine in an e-mail interaction.



The joint venture focuses on the design, development, marketing, supply and support of civilian and select defence radars. It is also exploring the possibility of developing passive and multi static passive surveillance radar as futuristic air traffic surveillance and management, and multi target tracking radars for Naval Fire Control application, among other things.



“The initial product portfolio of BEL-Thales Systems Limited will comprise innovative solutions for air surveillance, including Air Traffic Management radars, and select ground based military radars,” said Caput, adding, “The ultimate objective of the joint venture is to expand its scope in fields such as defence electronics domain.” The multinational giant has operations in aerospace, transport, defence and security. Under earlier license deals with the French company, BEL has built Thales LW04, DA08 and ZW06 naval radars.



Sources indicated that Thales will supply six of the 19 Ground Smarter low-level transportable radars that the Indian Air Force (IAF) has ordered from France, with the other 13 will be assembled in BEL’s facility at Ghaziabad.

It said it would consider the matter further on November 24.The plea by the NGO, filed in 2006, has alleged inaction on the part of the CBI in investigating allegations regarding the deal.The NGO in its plea had said that the copy of the CBI's preliminary enquiry report has not been provided to it on the ground that it contains sensitive information.The report was filed before the court in a sealed cover by the CBI which had given a clean chit to the deal.The petitioner has alleged that though the government had prior information about the ""shady deal and involvement of middlemen as pointed out by the CVC and the Ministry of Defence , the contract was finalised for obvious reasons""."
