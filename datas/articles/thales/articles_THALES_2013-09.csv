News

LONDON. Thales UK demonstrated the Halcyon reconfigurable Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) at the Defence Security and Equipment International (DSEI) 2013 conference in London, UK. The 11.5m optionally-manned Halcyon is constructed from glass-reinforced plastic and is designed for Mine Countermeasures (MCM).

The USV is outfitted with two 480hp Yanmar 6LY-ETP diesel engines, and has the ability to reach 30 kts. Halcyon is designed to meet a series of user requirements specific to the MCM mission, including a capability to deploy from military platforms, payload flexibility (disposal systems and influence minesweeping gear, towed sonar, Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV)), platform stability, and a reduced size and weight that allows air transportation.

The Halcyon was developed in conjunction with unmanned marine specialist ASV, and is a customized variant of ASV’s C-Sweep semi-planing displacement USV design.

Halcyon has recently completed the first round of payload, manned, and unmanned trials. A formal demonstration is planned for late October, and additional payload trials will begin in 2014.

U.S. Satellite Component Maker Fined $8 Million for ITAR Violations - SpaceNews,"Thu, 05 Sep 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS8zNzA3MXVzLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS1jb21wb25lbnQtbWFrZXItZmluZWQtOC1taWxsaW9uLWZvci1pdGFyLXZpb2xhdGlvbnMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"WASHINGTON — A U.S. supplier of radiation-hardened electronics for space and defense applications has agreed to pay an $8 million fine and adopt remedial measures to settle pending government charges that it failed to obtain proper export licenses for hardware that in many cases found its way aboard satellites that were launched from China and India.

The company, Aeroflex of Plainview, N.Y., supplied components that European manufacturer Thales Alenia Space used on communications satellites that were marketed as devoid of restricted U.S. technology and therefore eligible to launch on Chinese rockets. U.S. rules forbid the export of virtually any satellite hardware or technology to China.

To get around that ban, Thales Alenia Space of France and Italy developed a satellite platform that supposedly contained no parts subject to the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), a set of rules that govern exports of militarily sensitive technology including space systems. Exports of ITAR-controlled technology are tightly controlled by the U.S. Department of State.

Following a State Department investigation into its so-called ITAR-free product, Thales Alenia Space on Aug. 9 issued a statement saying the term was a misnomer and blaming unspecified U.S. companies for misrepresenting their wares as dual-use items subject to licensing by the more permissive U.S. Department of Commerce. “These hardware items were in fact defense articles controlled for export by the Department of State under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations,” the statement read, in part.

Aeroflex was one of those companies, according to documents posted online by the State Department. The company appears to be the first called to account for improperly labeling its hardware.

In a July 25 “proposed charging letter” to Aeroflex Chief Executive Leonard Borow, the State Department accused various company divisions of 158 violations of the Arms Export Control Act and ITAR “in connection with unauthorized exports and retransfers, and re-exports of defense articles, to include technical data, to various countries, including proscribed destinations.” Signed by Daniel J. Buzby, acting director of compliance within State’s Office of Defense Trade Controls, the letter said there was a systemic, company-wide failure to determine proper export jurisdiction for its defense-related merchandise. Domestic purchasers of Aeroflex’s ITAR-controlled microelectronics also made unauthorized exports based on the improper designation, the charging letter said.

The company relied on Commerce Department guidance to classify its radiation-hardened products when in fact only the State Department has the authority to determine whether an item is ITAR-controlled, the letter said. In one instance the company sought a State ruling on a particular integrated circuit for satellites but after the hardware was deemed ITAR-controlled did not apply the same logic to similar products. Further, Aeroflex officials failed to disseminate State’s findings throughout the company and its subsidiaries, the letter said.

After a subsequent request for a State commodity jurisdiction determination resulted in a similar finding, Aeroflex filed a voluntary disclosure with State. The disclosure was the first of several that the company had mislabeled various components for more than a decade starting in 1999, the letter states.

In one of those disclosures, filed Oct. 15, 2009, Aeroflex said that from 2001 to 2003 it shipped 100 application-specific integrated circuits to France for use on the Spacebus 4000 platform, which is a Thales Alenia Space geostationary satellite model. “These items were subsequently launched from the People’s Republic of China,” the letter said.

The items in question were radiation-hardened gate arrays that had been specifically customized for the Spacebus 4000, the letter said. “The unauthorized re-exports caused harm to national security by providing the People’s Republic of China a more reliable satellite capability,” the letter said.

Aeroflex also shipped, from 2005 through 2006, unauthorized items to the United Arab Emirates for end use on India’s GSAT-5, Resourcesat-2 and Oceansat-2 satellites, the letter said. While the company explained that it believed the components were not subject to ITAR controls, it requested a commodity jurisdiction determination and exported the hardware while the review was still underway, the letter said.

In a two-year consent agreement Borow signed July 26, Aeroflex agreed to a series of mandatory remedial measures and to pay an $8 million fine. Half of the fine is to be paid in cash installments, with the other half suspended in recognition of expenses already incurred by the company for voluntary remedial measures, assuming State approves.

The mandatory remedial measures include the appointment, subject to State Department approval, of an official to monitor the company’s compliance with the ITAR and the Arms Export Control Act, and the adoption of new export compliance procedures and training.

In addition, Aeroflex must review and verify export jurisdiction of all hardware in its ITAR-regulated divisions and subject itself to two outside audits to assess the effectiveness of the remedial measures.

“Aeroflex disclosed nearly all of the ITAR violations resolved in this settlement voluntarily to the Department, acknowledged their serious nature, cooperated with Department reviews, and since 2008 has implemented or has planned extensive remedial measures, including the restructuring of its compliance organization, the institution of a new testing protocol of its commodities, and a revised company-wide ITAR compliance program,” the State Department said in an Aug. 9 press release. “For these reasons, the Department determined that an administrative debarment of Aeroflex was not appropriate at this time.”

Thales Alenia Space has discontinued its ITAR-free satellite product line.

Andrew Kaminsky, Aeroflex vice president of corporate development and investor relations, did not respond to a request for comment."
EXCLUSIVE: Moreno Makes his Mark on South Carolina Rivalry - Clemson Tigers,"Tue, 03 Sep 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vY2xlbXNvbnRpZ2Vycy5jb20vZXhjbHVzaXZlLW1vcmVuby1tYWtlcy1oaXMtbWFyay1vbi1zb3V0aC1jYXJvbGluYS1yaXZhbHJ5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"CLEMSON, SC – A native of Brazil who just arrived on Clemson’s campus in July, Thales De Mello Moreno got a quick primer from his Tiger teammates Sunday on their rivalry with South Carolina.

One day later, he made his mark on it.

After the Tigers let a first-half lead slip away after halftime and the match went into overtime, Moreno scored the golden goal on a left-footed drive from the top of the box that nestled into the bottom corner 1:36 into the second extra stanza to lift Clemson to a 2-1 win Monday night at Historic Riggs Field.

“It was a great moment,” Moreno said. “It was the best moment for me in Clemson so far.”

Of course, “so far” amounts to exactly nine weeks.

The Tigers (2-0) went ahead during the 23rd minute when Thomas McNamara scored his second goal of the season on a penalty kick after the Gamecocks were called for handball in the box.

But after an early barrage of chances, Clemson’s momentum dwindled, and South Carolina was able to push the action more consistently into its attacking half. It scored the equalizer in the 55th minute off a corner kick, which Mahamoudou Kaba headed home to tie the score 1-1.

Clemson regained control of the run of play late in the second half and pushed for a winner in regulation, but came up empty through the end of the first 90 minutes and the 10 minutes of the first overtime.

“What I was really proud of the team for was they got a grip of the game again,” Tiger head coach Mike Noonan said. “They brought it back to the way that Clemson wants to play soccer, and those are signs of a maturing team.”

In the 102nd minute, the ball fell to Moreno’s feet just outside the box, and he fired a shot through his defender’s legs and past keeper Robert Beebe for the walk-off win.

“We had gone from side to side and we had spread South Carolina’s defense, and Thales got into the gap,” Noonan said. “When you put him on to his left foot, you’re at your peril. He’s dangerous. The guys were all saying that’s his sweet spot. We’ve seen him score many times like that in practice.”

Moreno hails from Monte Santo de Minas, Brazil, but came to Clemson more directly from Montverde Academy in Montverde, FL, where he was coached by the only athletic and academic All-American in the history of Clemson’s program, Mike Potempa, who is also a former Tiger assistant coach.

Moreno – whose full name is Thales De Mello Moreno – is one of three Tigers who played at Montverde, along with fellow midfielder Alexandre Rome’o Happi, who also took part in Monday’s win, and defender Mauriq Hill, who has been injured.

All three are freshmen who played together on Montverde’s National Championship team in the 2012-13 winter season, and Moreno was named Gatorade Florida Boys Soccer Player of the Year.

Raised in soccer-crazed Brazil, Moreno has been playing the game “since (he) was born” and was a star on the Paraiso Futsal team, as well as playing for Palmeiras – a Brazilian football club from Sao Paulo – as a youth.

He came to the United States to play soccer two years ago and eventually made his way to Clemson for a visit to campus.

“I came here to visit, and I liked it a lot,” Moreno said.

He arrived on July 1 to enroll in summer school and begin training. Moreno speaks English well enough to attend classes, as well as answer the questions of reporters moments after his game-winner, obviously, but it’s clear he’s not totally comfortable with the language just yet.

“It’s funny because sometimes in our meetings and stuff, I’m asking Thales, ‘Do you understand?’ And he’s nodding his head,” Noonan said. “He’s not convincing that he completely understands – but when it comes to soccer, it’s a universal language.”

The goal was the first of his Clemson career, but he is already playing a significant role on the team, being trusted enough by Noonan to handle many of the corner kicks and free kicks, particularly when leading scorer McNamara is not on the field.

“We’re deeper than we’ve been in the past,” Noonan said. “Tommy ran out of gas, and we were able to substitute him with the eventual goal-scorer. Thales is a young talent, and those are the types of things we brought him to Clemson to do.”

And he did it against the school’s biggest rival Monday, netting the walk-off winner to keep the Tigers unbeaten and untied on the season ahead of Friday’s Atlantic Coast Conference opener against Virginia.

“The rivalry is one thing; that’s for a lot of people outside our team,” Noonan said. “What we did tonight was win a game for our team and for Clemson. It’s an important rivalry, there’s no question. It’s fun to be a part of it. But … the emotion didn’t get too much for the players, and that’s why I think they were able to regain their composure and eventually win the game.”"
How to Spot Commercial Cygnus Craft Chasing ISS for Sept. 22 Coupling - Universe Today,"Fri, 20 Sep 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVuaXZlcnNldG9kYXkuY29tLzEwNDkzMS9ob3ctdG8tc3BvdC1jb21tZXJjaWFsLWN5Z251cy1jcmFmdC1jaGFzaW5nLWlzcy1mb3Itc2VwdC0yMi1jb3VwbGluZy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"After launching to orbit atop the Antares rocket on Sept. 18, the first ever Cygnus cargo spacecraft is chasing the ISS and set to dock on Sept 22. Until then you have the opportunity to track it in the night skies. This full scale, high fidelity mockup of the Orbital Sciences/Thales Alenia Cygnus gives a feel for it being similar in size to a small room. Credit: Ken Kremer (kenkremer.com)

Story Updated: Further details and photos – and NASA TV link to Live Docking Coverage [/caption]

WALLOPS ISLAND, VA – Following Wednesday morning’s (Sept. 18) spectacular blastoff of the Antares rocket with the commercial Cygnus resupply spacecraft, sky watchers now have a very limited window of opportunity to spot the maiden Cygnus chasing down the International Space Station (ISS) in the early morning skies before it arrives for the historic 1st rendezvous and docking on Sunday morning, Sept 22.

So between now and early Sunday you have the chance to gaze skywards and see and photograph history’s first Earth orbiting Cygnus hunting the ISS and gradually close in for the delicate coupling maneuver.

Here’s our guide on ‘How to Spot Cygnus’.

Sighting opportunities are available worldwide from at least North and South America, Europe, Asia and Africa according to NASA’s ‘Spot the Station’ website – here. See more websites listed below.

Update 4 a.m. Sunday Sept 22– Cygnus Rendezvous Delayed 48 Hours due to communications glitch

Update Sept 23: delayed to no earlier than Saturday due to Soyuz launch on Wednesday. Thus more chances to view!

Time is of the essence! So don’t delay to check this out!

Since the successful separation of the first Cygnus – built by Orbital Sciences and Thales Alenia – from Antares, the Earth orbiting vehicle has been successfully firing its hydrazine fueled thrusters to move ever closer to the massive orbiting lab complex – at a rate of 82 statute miles per orbit..

If all of the ten on orbit maneuvering tests proceed satisfactorily, Cygnus will reach the vicinity of the station on Sunday early morning (US East Coast time).

“There are some ‘goodies’ stowed on board for the crew’s enjoyment,” Alan Lindenmoyer, NASA’s program manager for commercial crew and cargo, told Universe Today at NASA Wallops.

ISS astronauts Karen Nyberg (NASA) and Luca Parmitano (ESA) are scheduled to grapple Cygnus with the station’s Canadian built robotic arm between 7:15 and 7:30 a.m. EDT, if all goes well.

Nyberg and Parmitano, working at a robotic work station in the Cupola module, are due to install the cargo carrier at an earth facing docking port on the Harmony pressurized module as early as 9 a.m. EDT, Sept 22.

It’s the same docking port already used by the SpaceX Dragon cargo vessel on three successful missions to date since 2012.

Although Cygnus is much smaller than the ISS, it should still be visible – weather permitting of course.

At 17 feet (5 meters) long and 10 feet (3 meters) wide, Cygnus is the size of a small room.

In fact, while I was at NASA Wallops this week reporting on the Antares launch for Universe Today, I had a chance to visit a full scale, high fidelity mockup of Cygnus built for Orbital Sciences and on display at the local community center in Chincoteague, VA.

The Cygnus display model gives one a great feel for just how big Cygnus really is- see my photos herein.

A full size human mannequin standing inside showed that a human can fit comfortably inside.

Thales Alenia Space in Italy designed and constructed the 17 foot ( 5 meter) long Cygnus pressurized module under contract with Orbital.

“Thales Alenia has actually built 50% of the pressurized modules currently comprising the ISS,” said Luigi Quaglino, Thales Alenia Senior Vice President.

“We have built 25 pressurized space modules and learned a lot along the way,” Quaglino told Universe Today at NASA Wallops.

The ISS is the largest manmade object in orbit. It’s the size of a football field and the brightest object in the night sky after the Moon thanks also to the huge, reflecting solar arrays.

Cygnus will be significantly dimmer, but nevertheless should be readily visible.

Look for a ‘star’ moving gradually against the backdrop of stars trailing behind the ISS that likewise appears as a bright moving ‘star’.

As Sunday approaches, the gap between the ISS and Cygnus narrows.

On Thursday Cygnus was trailing about 10 minutes behind the ISS. Whereas on Friday and Saturday, the gap narrows down to roughly 4 minutes and then just 1 minute.

You can also try and photograph the ISS and Cygnus trails by mounting your camera on a tripod and leaving the shutter open at least several seconds and longer. Send me any cool time lapse photos to post here at Universe Today.

Many folks have never seen an ISS flyover and this is a fantastic time to start as the dynamic duo speed merrily across the nighttime sky.

To determine if there are any favorable sighting opportunities in your area, check out NASA’s Spot the Station website – here.

Check the NASA website for a detailed listing of the precise times, elevations, direction and durations. It’s an easy to use viewing guide. Just plug in the particulars of the country in which you live.

Another great source is Heaven’s Above – here

Also check Spaceweather.com – here

And Orbital Sciences reports that “AGI has developed a slick interactive 2D/3D simulation that allows you to track the location of Cygnus in real-time.”

Details here and here

I have personally watched the SpaceX Dragon, European ATV and Japanese HTV cargo carriers streaking through the night sky, trailing a few minutes behind the ISS. And it’s always a thrill.

The cargo vessel will deliver about 1,300 pounds (589 kilograms) of cargo, including food, clothing, water, science experiments, spare parts and gear to the Expedition 37 crew.

Cygnus will remain attached to the ISS for about a month. The astronauts will unload the supplies including few goodies starting on Monday. They they’ll pack it with trash. After undocking Cygnus will come to a flaming finale by burning up upon reentry into the Earth’s atmosphere.

So there should be a final opportunity to view it circling Earth.

NASA Television coverage of the arrival and capture of Cygnus will begin at 4:30 a.m. EDT

Streaming video will be available on NASA’s website at http://www.nasa.gov/ntv

Saturday evening Update:

NASA has given the GO for Sunday morning Docking !



Happy Viewing and Clear Skies

Thales offers new vision of targeting and surveillance with SOPHIE Lite - defenceWeb,"Thu, 12 Sep 2013 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWZlbmNld2ViLmNvLnphL2luZHVzdHJ5L2luZHVzdHJ5LWluZHVzdHJ5L3RoYWxlcy1vZmZlcnMtbmV3LXZpc2lvbi1vZi10YXJnZXRpbmctYW5kLXN1cnZlaWxsYW5jZS13aXRoLXNvcGhpZS1saXRlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Thales UK today launched a new lightweight multifunction surveillance and target locator system, SOPHIE Lite. Weighing in at class-leading, fully-operational weight of only 1.6kg, SOPHIE Lite can be deployed in a variety of operational scenarios by both military and civil users.

The new ultra-compact system has a fully-integrated suite of sensors, including an uncooled thermal imager, TV/Near Infra-Red (NIR) sensor, high-performance eyesafe laser rangefinder, digital compass and GPS. Operational roles for SOPHIE Lite include force protection, forward observation, forward air control, covert surveillance, asset protection and homeland security.

SOPHIE Lite is the latest addition to Thales’s family of combat-proven SOPHIE cameras, which collectively offer the widest range of capabilities to meet any operational requirement for hand¬held surveillance and targeting. Thousands of Sophie cameras are in operation with armed forces, including the British Army, and security teams around the world.

“Since the launch of SOPHIE UF in 2009, Thales has worked continually to evolve the product in line with customer needs, reducing the weight from 3.5kg then to 1.6kg today,” said Gil Michielin, Vice President of Thales’s optronics business.

“To reduce the weight by nearly 2kg, without compromising even 1 per cent of the performance, is a significant achievement and of enormous value to the soldiers and security personnel who carry the camera as part of their standard kit.

“SOPHIE Lite is light, small and affordable. Switching from standard optical to digital technologies has reduced the weight and enhanced the image delivered to the user. We believe that the combination of functionality and specification will extend the appeal of SOPHIE Lite to a broader user base, including security teams and mobile perimeter guards; SOPHIE Lite is small enough to fit in the glove compartment of even a standard saloon car, for instance.

“This is an exciting evolution of our popular SOPHIE offering. We have paid serious attention to feedback from our customers, and indeed potential customers, to ensure that SOPHIE Lite hits the mark with its performance, functionality and ease of use.”

The French-owned company is in a good position to win a $1 billion-plus contract to supply 1300 armoured vehicles to the ADF under its Land 121 project, which will see much of the ADF vehicle fleet replaced over a number of years.



Thales has been named as the preferred supplier for the Hawkei project after its design for an armoured six-seat vehicle was selected for further development and testing. The Hawkei is also one of Australia’s deadliest snakes.



The Thales proposal is not a certainty to win the contract as the ADF is still monitoring development of the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV), which is being developed in the US to replace the Humvee.



In 2009, Australia funded the construction of nine of the first 30 JLTV prototypes, before selecting Thales as the preferred Hawkei tenderer. The Thales design was selected under the ‘Manufactured and Supported in Australia’ option in the contract specification.



If the Thales proposal for the Hawkei ‘protected light vehicle’ wins the contract, Thales will have to thoroughly overhaul the current vehicle operations at its Bendigo plant, which currently produces the 10-seater Bushmaster troop carrier.



Thales has already reached out to the local automotive supply sector, thanks to invitations from GM Holden and Toyota to attend supplier forums earlier this year. The company is hoping to learn about the latest vehicle production techniques and procurement systems used in the car industry.



The interaction could be mutually beneficial, with the defence contractors potentially finding faster, cheaper suppliers and learning about the latest production techniques and procurement systems while the auto parts suppliers may gain extra production volume.



In fact, a recent tour of the Bendigo plant showed that Thales has already started lifting ideas from the mass-production sector.



On the Bushmaster assembly line, there are simple towers of plastic baskets about 150cm high. They are set on wheels so they can move easily up and down the line.



The baskets contain various pieces, parts and fixing systems needed to assemble the Bushmaster. The towers of baskets are not hi-tech, ergonomic or the least bit sophisticated. But the sign on top says it all. These are “Kanban Stations”.



They do not look like the kanban stations you see in Toyota plants, but they are a statement of intent for Thales. Kanban is the Japanese system used to achieve lean and just-in-time production.



“The kanban stations on the Bushmaster line are all part of the continuous improvement,” said Thales Australia director of strategy, sales and marketing Paul Harris, who conducted GoAuto’s tour of the Bendigo plant.



“We have done a lot of study and a lot of work to improve what we did with Bushmaster. The production team (members) have all been doing courses on lean manufacturing and other specialist manufacturing courses.” “What they are going to do is grab all these lessons learnt and have regular meetings. When a bright idea emerges they can incorporate it immediately.” Mr Harris said the advent of the Hawkei project would force a complete reorganisation of the vehicle assembly operations at Bendigo, and Thales wanted to take the opportunity to bring the operations right up to date.



“We have done a lot of study and a lot of work to improve what we did with Bushmaster. The production team (members) have all been doing courses on lean manufacturing and other specialist manufacturing courses.” In fact, several people at Bendigo have worked in the Holden, Toyota and Ford plants, although the scale of operations could hardly be more different.



While the car plants measure output in tens of thousands of units, the Thales plant has produced a little over 1000 Bushmasters in 14 years.



Mr Harris points out that many items and tasks on the Bushmaster and, in future, the Hawkei have to be done to military specifications (milspec).



“A lot of things on these vehicles you could not do on a Toyota production line because it is milspec,” he said. “Other aspects, yes, you can get straight from Ford or Toyota and just rip it in.



“How many Toyotas coming down the line have central tyre inflation systems? There’s quite a process in testing that as the vehicle moves down the line.” The Hawkei production contract has not been awarded yet, but six Thales prototypes are currently undergoing gruelling testing with the Army.



The public will get its first glimpse of the Thales Hawkei during the current touring car endurance racing season, with Thales hosting a Hawkei stand and showing some video at the first three races of the V8 Ute series: Sandown, Bathurst and Gold Coast.



The Thales Hawkei will eventually make its public debut at the Olympic Park V8 Ute race in Sydney on December 6-8, right next to the new Thales headquarters in Murray Rose Avenue, between corners 10 and 11.



“Where better to show off what Australia can do than at the Auto One V8 Ute series?” said Thales Australia chief executive Chris Jenkins. “The Hawkei is Aussie knowhow at its best.



“Focused on winning and being the best, protecting your mates, that’s Australia. That’s what the Hawkei is all about, and we think this Aussie beast is in good company with the iconic Aussie ute.” While much of the Hawkei’s structural specifications are closely guarded, the vehicle comprises a sturdy safety cell passenger compartment with spaceframes front and rear.



In the front spaceframe, the engine and transmission are placed side by to enable a flat floor in the cabin. The whole front section has been designed to be sacrificed – easily replaced if damaged – in the event of a blast.



The Hawkei is powered by a Steyr 3.2 litre turbo-diesel engine producing 200kW/610Nm and weighing only 240kg. Transmission is by a ZF six-speed automatic gearbox.



All up, the Hawkei weighs in at less than 7 tonnes despite what Mr Harris says is “a very high level of protection” built into the vehicle.



This weight was right on target. The vehicle had to come in under 7 tonnes as that is the maximum lift capacity of the ADF’s Chinook helicopters, which will be a key means of deployment for the Hawkei.



The Bendigo plant is the only vehicle manufacturing site in the €14.2 billion ($A20.3b) worldwide Thales group and is essentially self-reliant when it comes to vehicle design, procurement and production systems.



The Bushmaster is the only vehicle Thales makes at present, and it is used by the Australian and Netherlands armies. It has seen action in East Timor, Afghanistan and Iraq.



Production of the Bushmaster has totalled 1040 since it went into production in 1998. Military orders can be notoriously lumpy, but that suggests an average production rate of 69 Bushmasters a year, or five a month.



Production of 1300 Hawkeis is likely to be at a much faster rate than that, which is why Thales is working hard to improve its procurement and production abilities.



Under the Land 121 project, the ADF will acquire 7500 light, lightweight, medium and heavy-duty vehicles, both protected and unprotected.



The Hawkei segment is the last part of the Land 121 project. So far the ADF has ordered 2146 unprotected Mercedes-Benz G-Wagons and 2700 medium and heavy duty MAN trucks.



The G-Wagons and the Hawkei will replace the current fleet of protected and unprotected Land Rovers and the MAN trucks will replace a fleet of Unimog, Mack and S-Liner trucks.

Navy Commander-in-Chief Adm. Surasak Runroengrom and Royal Thai Fleet Commander Adm. Kanat Tongpool set HTMS Krabi on its way from the Sattahip Naval Base Aug. 26.

Surasak said construction of the 2.9 billion baht ship was part of the navy’s battle-readiness development to protect the country, prevent incursions into territorial waters and assist victims of disasters.

The Krabi, a modified British River-class vessel, was at Sattahip’s Mahidol Adulyadej Royal Navy Dock from 2009-2011 and was launched by HRH Princess Sirindhorn in December of that year. The time since has been spent outfitting the ship at Bangkok Dock Co. with assistance from BAE Systems Service Ships.

Measuring 90.5 meters long, the Krabi is 13.5 meters wide, carries a draft of 3.8 meters and weighs 1,969 tons. Top speed is 23 knots. The ship carries an Oto Melara 76mm main gun and two MSI 30mm secondary guns for primary defense, as well as machine guns. It also is equipped with a Thales Variant surveillance radar, a Thales Lirod Mk2 fire control radar and the Thales Tacticos combat management system. It carries a complement of 89 sailors and can accommodate the landing of a Superlink helicopter.

The Krabi is expected to patrol Thailand’s economic-exclusion zone, the 200 nautical miles in which Thailand has special rights over the exploration and use of marine resources, including energy production, fisheries and natural resources.

The pride of the Royal Thai Navy, the HTMS Krabi set out from the Sattahip Naval Base Aug. 26."
