By C.D.C. Reeve |

Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes were from Miletus, which is on the Ionian coast of Asia Minor. Their great successor Heraclitus was from Ephesus, which is on the same coast. Together these Ionian thinkers of the sixth and late fifth centuries brought about one of the most significant revolutions we know of, one that set the civilized world on a path it has followed, with minor and not so minor deviations, ever since. What they did, to put it boldly and rather simply, was to invent critical rationality. For the theories they advanced, whether on the nature and origins of the cosmos or on ethics and politics, were not offered as gospels to be accepted on divine or human authority or, like Hesiod’s cosmology, on the authority of the Muses, but as rational constructions to be accepted or rejected on the basis of evidence and argument. Every university and college, every intellectual discipline and scientific advance, every step towards freedom and away from ignorance, superstition, and enslavement to repressive dogma is eloquent testimony to the power of their invention. If they had not existed, our world would not exist.

Of these thinkers, Thales was the first. His reputation in antiquity was immense. He was one of the fabled Seven Sages (Solon was another). He is credited with being able to predict solar eclipses and with determining the height of the pyramids by measuring the length of their shadows. Whether he wrote anything is unknown. If he did, no genuine fragment of it has survived. But despite the fact that we possess none of Thales’ original words, we do know that he held that everything is water, or something to that effect.

The first thing to notice about this claim is that it says that there is really only one thing—water—and that everything else is in some way made up of or built out of it. We don’t know just why Thales assigned such a fundamental role to water. Perhaps, as Aristotle claims, he noticed that water is essential in various ways to the existence of living things (Metaphysics, 983b22–27), or that water alone exists naturally as a solid, liquid, and gas, and so might be the fundamental stuff from which all things were made. If Thales did think in either of these ways, his doctrine is a prototype of many fundamental scientific doctrines. It is based (no doubt somewhat loosely) on evidence and argument, and it suggests that a single thing underlies and explains the apparent diversity of phenomena. Modern scientists who claim that everything is mass-energy or that the four-dimensional space-time continuum is the only real thing are heirs to Thales.

Thales

Two ancient stories about Thales are worth repeating, because of the somewhat different light they cast on early philosophy. The first is recounted in Plato’s Theaetetus:

Once while Thales was gazing upwards while doing astronomy, he fell into a well. A clever and delightful Thracian serving girl is said to have made fun of him, since he was eager to know the things in the heavens but failed to notice what was in front of him and right next to his feet (174a4–8).

The second story might be thought of as Thales’ slightly revengeful response to the servant-girl. It is found in Aristotle’s Politics:

The story goes that when they found fault with him [Thales] for his poverty, supposing that philosophy is useless, he learned from his astronomy that there would be a large crop of olives. Then, while it was still winter, he obtained a little money and made deposits on all the olive presses both in Miletus and in Chios. Since no one bid against him, he rented them cheaply. When the right time came, suddenly many tried to get the presses all at once, and he rented them out on whatever terms he wished, and so made a great deal of money. In this way he proved that philosophers can easily be wealthy if they desire, but this is not what they are interested in (I 11 1259a9–18).

The moral of the story is that apparently arcane knowledge can have important practical uses, so that philosophy can help us to live well, and that we neglect it at our peril (see Plato, Republic 487d ff.).

Anaximander was a younger contemporary of Thales. Only a few words of his writings have survived, but ancient sources give us a vivid idea of their astonishing scope. They contained a cosmogony, or account of the origins of the cosmos; an account of the origins of life; astronomical, meteorological, and biological speculations; and a map of the known world. Our primary interest is in Anaximander’s most general explanatory doctrine, but a brief glimpse at two of his other views shows what a daring thinker he was.

The first of these concerns the origin of human beings:

[Anaximander] also declares that in the beginning humans were born from other kinds of animals, since other animals quickly manage on their own, and humans alone require lengthy nursing. For this reason, in the beginning, they would not have been preserved if they had been like this.

Here an observation coupled with an insightful piece of argument leads to a daring hypothesis: Human beings were not made by gods. They came from other animals.

Anaximander

The second piece of Anaximandrian speculation concerns the ancient question of what holds up the earth. Thales seems to have held that the earth is floating on water, “as if,” Aristotle witheringly comments, “the same question did not arise . . . for the water supporting the earth” (De Caelo 294a32–23). Aware, perhaps, of this defect in Thales’ answer and in other similar ones, Anaximander proposed a different kind of answer altogether. He declared that

the earth is at rest on account of its similarity. For it is no more fitting for what is established at the center and equally related to the extremes to move up rather than down or sideways. And it is impossible for it to make a move simultaneously in opposite directions. Therefore, it is at rest of necessity.

In other words, the earth doesn’t move, not because it’s held up by something else, but because there’s nothing to cause it to move in one way rather than another. The cleverness of this answer is obvious, since it gets around the kind of criticism that Aristotle uses against Thales.

I turn now to Anaximander’s fundamental doctrine:

Of those who declare that the first principle is one, moving, and indefinite, Anaximander . . . said that the indefinite was the first principle and element of things that are . . . He says that the first principle is neither water nor any other of the things called elements, but some other nature which is indefinite, out of which come to be all the heavens and the worlds in them.

The fundamental stuff out of which everything else is made or comes to be isn’t any of the four recognized elements—earth, water, fire, and air (or dry, wet, hot, and cold)—but a fifth thing, the unlimited. Why? According to Aristotle (Physics III 5 204b22–29), Anaximander argued, “If everything is water, then everything must have the properties of water. But not only do some things lack these properties, some even have properties that are the opposites of those possessed by water: Earth isn’t wet, it’s dry. Since nothing can be both wet and dry, how can dry earth just be some form of wet water? How can what just is wet water become dry?” This is a powerful argument for thinking that if there is a single stuff of which all things (including the elements) are made, it cannot have any definite characteristics of its own. It must be indeterminate in quality.

More significantly, this Anaximandrian argument is a telling criticism of his predecessor, Thales. Consequently, it’s a good example of the critical rationality I praise the Greek philosophers for inventing. Anaximander didn’t accept Thales’ doctrines on his authority or, as we are asked to accept Hesiod’s cosmogony, on the authority of the Muses; rather, he submitted them to rational scrutiny, modifying those that failed to pass muster and accepting only those that did. In the Nicomachean Ethics, just as he is about to criticize the doctrines of his own teacher, Plato, Aristotle recommends this as the appropriate attitude for a philosopher to take to his forebears:

It presumably seems better, indeed only right, to destroy even what is close to us if that is the way to preserve the truth. And we must especially do this when we are philosophers, [lovers of wisdom]; for though we love both the truth and our friends, piety requires us to honour the truth first (I 6 1096a).

Paradoxically, then, it is by destroying Thales’ doctrines, rather than by accepting them unquestioningly, that Anaximander reveals himself as Thales’ true heir.

In addition to criticizing Thales’ doctrines, Anaximander also made an important suggestion about what causes the elements to interact and give rise to the things we see around us:

The things that are perish into the things out of which they come to be, according to necessity, for they pay penalty and retribution to each other for their injustice in accordance with the ordering of time.

His idea seems to be that elements, conceived of as opposite powers (dry/wet, hot/cold), struggle with one another, with sometimes one gaining the upper hand, sometimes another. When this happens the balance or equilibrium of the cosmos is disturbed: one opposite has gained “unjustly” at the expense of another, and must of necessity—or because of the laws governing the cosmos—pay reparation to it in due course, so that equilibrium is restored once more. No doubt this is, indeed, “rather poetical,” as Simplicius puts it, but it certainly shouldn’t be dismissed on that account. For it contains the fundamentally important notion that the natural world is governed by necessity (by law) not by the arbitrary whim of the gods. Many good and fruitful theories start their lives as metaphors.

Anaximenes

Anaximander’s follower, Anaximenes, developed Anaximander’s account of the elements and introduced significant economies into it. In Anaximander’s cosmology, there are four elements (earth, water, fire, and air) as well as the somewhat mysterious indeterminate stuff, whose relation to them is not fully explained. Thus Anaximander has five fundamental things in his ontology. Anaximenes seems to have realized that the unlimited was unnecessary baggage, that one of the elements could play its role. He claimed that air is the fundamental principle of everything, and that earth, water, and fire are simply air which is to different degrees either rarefied or condensed. Earth is very dense air; fire is very rarefied air:

The form of air is the following: when it is most even, it is invisible, but it is revealed by the cold and the hot and the wet, and movement. ... For when it is dissolved into what is finer, it comes to be fire, and on the other hand air comes to be winds when it becomes condensed. Cloud results from air through felting, and water when this happens to a greater degree. When condensed still more it becomes earth, and when it reaches the absolutely densest stage it becomes stones.

Thus Anaximenes’ theory is at once simpler and more complete than Anaximander’s. It needs only one thing—air—where Anaximander’s needs five. Moreover, it explains in a straightforward way what Anaximander leaves mysterious: how the one fundamental stuff can give rise to the other elements that appear in the world. This makes it a better theory and another good example of critical rationality—or a critically rational tradition—in operation.

The next step in this line of argument was taken by Heraclitus of Ephesus, a consummate thinker and writer, if a rather difficult one. In the following fragments, he speaks of the birth of one element as the death of another.

It is death to souls to become water, death to water to become earth, but from earth comes water and from water soul.

Fire lives the death of earth and air lives the death of fire, water lives the death of air, earth that of water.

If we set out the claims they make in a table, we can see that they describe the series of transformations already familiar to us from Anaximenes:

Death of Birth Of Fire Air Air Water Water Earth Earth Water Road A (Downward Road) Road B (Upward Road)

Notice that the transformations are cyclical. When they are complete, what started as fire ends up being fire again.

Now, two questions naturally arise about this cycle of transformations: What causes it to occur? And what happens to fire, for example, when it becomes air? Anaximander’s answer to the first question is that strife between the opposites causes the transformations on Road A (the downward road), and that justice causes the transformations on Road B (the upward road). Heraclitus adopts this answer, but sees that it can be simplified without loss of explanatory power. He sees that because the transformations are cyclical, we do not need two forces—strife and justice—to drive them, but only one. Hence he tells us that “justice is strife,” that “the road up and the road down are one and the same,” and that “the beginning and end are common on the circumference of a circle.” Thus the force that transforms fire into air also transforms air back into fire. (This Heraclitean criticism of Anaximander is a model of critical scientific rationality at work. Physicists like Steven Weinberg or Murray Gell-Mann, who look for Grand Unified Theories in which gravitational, electromagnetic, and weak and strong forces are unified, are heirs to Heraclitus.)

To see how Heraclitus answered the question about what happens to fire when strife causes it to become air, we must begin, as he surely did, with Anaximenes. In Anaximenes’ view, elements change into one another by becoming more rarified or more condensed. But this account is uneconomical because it introduces a new primitive notion—rarifaction/condensation—over and above the original four elements. Heraclitus seems to have noticed this defect in Anaximenes’ theory and tried to rectify it. In his view, all that happens when fire is transformed into air is that it dies down. Thus Road A (the downward road) is the progressive dying down of fire and Road B (the upward one) is its progressive rekindling. Thus only fire “being kindled in measures and being extinguished in measures,” is needed to explain how strife (justice) causes the elements to be transformed into one another, so that their cyclical transformations are simply “the turnings of fire.”

Heraclitus

But why does Heraclitus assign such a fundamental role to fire rather than to air or one of the other elements? Why does he identify the cosmos with “ever-living fire” rather than with ever-living air or ever-living water? Why is Road A the progressive dying down of fire rather than the progressive drying of the wet? To see a possible answer, we need to return to the first question we raised: What causes the elements to be transformed into one another? Anaximander’s answer was strife and justice. Heraclitus simplifies this to a single causal agent: strife. But Anaximander does not tell us why the elements strive with one another in the first place. Strife enters the Anaximandrian cosmos, as it were, from the outside; it is something extrinsic to, or over and above, the unlimited and the four elements. Strife, however, is intrinsic to a cosmos of fire. For fire is “want and satiety”: it exists only when striving with what it is trying to burn; it simultaneously wants or needs fuel and is becoming hungry through consuming it. It is this dynamic feature, possessed by none of the other opposites, that most likely led Heraclitus to assign priority to it. It enables him to “reduce” strife to fire (since if fire exists so must strife) just as he has already reduced justice to strife.

One final theoretical advantage of fire deserves to be mentioned. Fire exists through striving with its fuel, but its striving is law-governed or measured:

Earth is poured out as sea, and is measured according to the same ratio (logos) it was before it became earth.

After all, the size or heat of fire is proportional to the amount of fuel being consumed. Thus if fire is the fundamentally real thing, this offers an explanation of the order observed in such things as the seasons and the rising and setting of the sun.

There is no doubt that the theory that results from these reductions is vastly more successful than any of the theories of Heraclitus’ predecessors. It is also fundamentally different in kind. Heraclitus doesn’t tell us that the cosmos and all its contents are fundamentally fire, he tells us that they are fire “being kindled in measures and being extinguished in measures.” This emphasizes the fact that what is fundamentally real for Heraclitus is not a static stuff to which change and activity are extrinsic, but a law-governed process or activity. Heraclitus differs from his predecessors, then, not simply in choosing fire rather than water, air, or the unlimited as his primary stuff, but in choosing law-governed change over static stability as being more fundamentally real. In the worlds of Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes, change depends on stability; in Heraclitus’ world, stability depends on change: “Changing, it rests.”

Heraclitus’ powerful vision of the world exerted enormous influence over his successors, who tried in various ways to destroy, criticize, modify, and augment it. But it is not his theory so much as the spirit in which he offers it, that I have wanted to emphasize. He wasn’t the first to theorize in that spirit, he was part of a tradition of critical rationality that already existed. But he was the first to give explicit voice to it:

Listening not to me but to the logos it is wise to agree that all things are one.

This is the injunction that all the subsequent Greek philosophers follow. As students of Greek philosophy, it is an injunction we must strive to follow ourselves. If we do, we will become what so many Greek philosophers thought was the best thing to be: critically rational human beings.

In instrument meteorological conditions or nighttime, the ideal, said Thales, would be to have the same instrumented view, but heads up, with the real world through it when visibility improves.

The advantages are that the pilots are fully orientated and terrain-aware while simultaneously monitoring the aircraft's performance and navigation. With the synthetic terrain and sky in sight at all times, the chances of becoming disorientated during bad weather or night flying on instruments is reduced to almost nothing. As Thales says, it is ""designed to capitalise on human strengths and avoid triggering human weaknesses"".

In a bad flightdeck, said Thales, the crew can become a ""bottleneck"" when workload is high, but this need not be so if the information the pilots need is supplied in a readily absorbed, intuitive way.

In the Thales vision, the future instrument panel would be touchscreen configurable, rather like an Apple iPhone. Pilots could call up 3-D schematic graphics of aircraft systems that have a problem. Thales likes the iPhone/iPad parallel, pointing out that the user does not have to know how the interface works to use it deftly and successfully.

France's Safran and Thales look to join forces - Flightglobal,"Sat, 18 Jun 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vZnJhbmNlcy1zYWZyYW4tYW5kLXRoYWxlcy1sb29rLXRvLWpvaW4tZm9yY2VzLzEwMDQ2Mi5hcnRpY2xl0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Among the inevitable Le Bourget buzz about aircraft sales and new technology will be one key piece of will-they-or-won't-they? Safran and Thales, two of the biggest names in French aerospace, are formally in negotiations about ""asset swaps"".

After several years of on-off talk of a merger or other tie-up, there's no cause to expect a rush to seal an agreement in time for a Paris air show announcement, but while both will be prominent exhibitors the main interest may be in what they are up to behind the scenes.

Neither company is saying anything beyond confirmation that they are talking. It is believed, though, that asset swaps could involve Thales getting some optical sensor businesses with such capabilities as night vision in exchange for some security and avionics-oriented businesses.

What is not known is whether the pair are also considering any wider alliance or even merger, and whether the French state, which is a major shareholder in both, is driving the negotiations. But both of those questions loom large over the wider French aerospace industry, which like its counterparts in the developed world is facing a transformative storm of forces including new competition from rising economies and shrinking defence budgets at home.

FRENCH APPROACH

Dassault's €1.57 billion ($2.26 billion) purchase of a fifth of Thales from ailing communications giant Alcatel-Lucent in 2009 probably says as much as needs saying about the French approach to its aerospace and defence companies. The deal made sense, as the two companies have a long history of working together. Thales, primarily focused on defence electronics, is a key supplier to the Dassault Rafale fighter used by the French air force and navy and now on the two-aircraft shortlist, with Eurofighter, for India's much-coveted strike jet contract.

The deal also kept Thales in French hands, leaving Dassault and the French state between them controlling the company. The only other likely bidder was Airbus parent EADS, which like Dassault is long on cash but at that time was too wrapped up in its Airbus Military A400M transporter travails to spare much thought to a major acquisition.

As the chart on this page shows, the French state remains an active shareholder in several of the big French aerospace players and is heavily tied in to both Dassault Aviation and EADS, with its heavy-fifth shareholding in the latter carefully balanced by German holdings. The French-German balance in EADS stems from that company's creation in 2000 from various state holdings and national champions of the two countries that had joined forces in the late 1960s to create Airbus.

But while Paris protects its interests in EADS and values the Airbus position as a global leader in civil aviation, on the defence side the partnership with Dassault clearly prevails. The existence of Rafale, which is similar to the EADS-led Eurofighter, proves as much. With Dassault Aviation, the government holds a short half of the company otherwise owned by privately held Groupe Dassault whose chief executive, Charles Edelstenne, is one of the richest men in France.

FRANCO-FRENCH DEAL

The prospect of a major merger or acquisition - the so-called ""Franco-French deal"" to create a mega-player, as one London analyst puts it - looks unlikely. EADS, of course, is ultimately the product of a merger. But while Paris and Berlin paid much attention to establishing a balance between their interests when they tied the knot, by 2000 the constituent parts of the company were, in practice, acting as one and so the creation of EADS was, in effect, a marriage that followed many years of successful cohabitation. Occasional whispers of an EADS move to absorb Safran or Thales have never gone beyond the rumour stage, and smell more of idle musings by fantasy merger and acquisition players than any real consideration inside corporate headquarters.

© Dassault The French state is a minority shareholder in fighter and business jet maker Dassault

Safran, too, was created by merger with the 2005 union of Snecma - whose roots go back to 1905 and the Gnome aero engine business, and is GE's 50:50 partner in the hugely successful CFM International civil engines venture - and Sagem, the mechanical engineering, defence electronics and telecoms group. Safran soon divested its mobile phone and broadband businesses to focus on its core aerospace and security businesses, a decision that many defence-heavy rivals must admire as they look enviously at the growth potential of the homeland security sector.

The history of corporate mergers and major acquisitions is littered with colossal failures, so the apparent success of the Snecma-Sagem marriage is a rarity - in 2010 Safran made €508 million on €10.8 billion sales - and EADS chief executive Louis Gallois has made it very clear that while the company is always interested in small, tactical acquisitions, anyone waiting for a big, transformative deal should stop holding their breath. As he considered buying Alcatel's Thales stake in 2009, Dassault's Edelstenne ruled out a full takeover, noting that cultural and other differences led 60% of such deals to be failures.

Thus the appeal of Thales-Safran ""asset swaps""; without the risk and expense of merging large companies, both may be able to ramp up their competitiveness by improving their technological, product and customer focus. Safran is already strong and while Thales lost €100 million in 2010 after taking a remarkable €700 million charge against troubled supply contracts including with the Airbus Military A400M, its problems do not look insoluble and chief executive Luc Vigneron, who took the helm in 2009 after Dassault's buy-in, looks to have a viable plan for turning the group around.

However, there is clear impetus for a French industry consolidation, at least on the defence side. Professor Joseph Lampel of City University London's Cass business school notes that the French see themselves as having, potentially, Europe's most powerful defence industry but know their companies have to grow to be world players, given the rise of competition from the likes of Brazil, China and India.

And, he adds, France is not alone in needing to encourage its defence industry players to press for scale if they are to be the principal suppliers to their domestic armed forces. Even the US government, he says, is not a big enough customer to support US firms' research and development spending without export sales. The French government, says Lampel, is ""no doubt"" playing a behind-the-scenes role in pressing for some industry restructuring.

France's increasingly internationalist foreign policy - see its re-engagement with NATO and willingness to take a lead, as in Libya this year - is creating both opportunity and challenge for French arms makers. The opportunity comes in greater interest from export customers and the challenge is in surviving as France, inevitably, opens up to more purchases of foreign-made equipment as it looks to maximise value for money in defence spending.

Thus, says Lampel, French industry has to respond: ""The economics of defence procurement is just too punitive with industry as it is.""

Aerospace and defence drive exports

Aerospace, defence, electronics and security is France's leading industry sector in exports and profit, contributing some €18 billion ($26 billion) to the country's balance of trade, according to industry association Gifas.

And, says Gifas chairman Jean-Paul Herteman: ""On the employment front, despite the economic crisis we took on 8,000 workers in 2010, raising the total workforce to 157,000, and have recruited 27,000 people since 2008.""

In 2010, industry revenue rose by 3.5% to €36.8 billion, with 73% of that being exports, thanks largely to civil business. Air transport led a 27% rise to €42.9 billion in the French industry order book, with the civil sector accounting for 71% of orders. For the seventeenth consecutive year, orders exceeded revenues and now stand at four years' output.

For equipment manufacturers, says Herteman, ""the recovery started to take shape in 2010"". Revenues were down 4.8% at €9.2 billion, but a 34% increase in orders, driven by the civil aviation sector, ""bodes well for the sector as a whole"", adds Herteman.

In the space industry, revenue edged down slightly to €4.2 billion.

Globalstar constellation

Six new Globalstar (Nasdaq:GSAT) satellites are now being prepared for the second launch of the Company's second-generation (2G) satellite constellation. Engineers and technicians from launch services provider Arianespace and satellite manufacturerhave begun the necessary testing and integration process in preparation for a July liftoff using the highly reliablelaunch vehicle from the. Later this year, Globalstar plans to conduct two additional launches of six satellites per launch, also using the Soyuz. In October 2010, the same launch vehicle was used to successfully launch six new Globalstar second-generation satellites.Globalstar signed a contract with Thales Alenia Space in late 2006 for the design, manufacture and delivery of its second-generation constellation satellites. In 2007, Globalstar contracted withfor a total of four launches of six satellites each using the reliable human-rated Soyuz, which is also used to launch astronauts and cosmonauts to the International Space Station. Globalstar plans to integrate the 24 new 2G satellites with the eight 1G satellites that were launched in 2007. The new satellites are designed to support Globalstar's current lineup of voice, Duplex and Simplex data products and services including the Company's lineup ofretail consumer products.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9999891519546509}",neutral,0.9999891519546509,0
Composite class: developing the Airbus A350-XWB - The Engineer,"Mon, 20 Jun 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWVuZ2luZWVyLmNvLnVrL2NvbnRlbnQvaW4tZGVwdGgvY29tcG9zaXRlLWNsYXNzLWRldmVsb3BpbmctdGhlLWFpcmJ1cy1hMzUwLXh3Yi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The future is plastics, as the young Dustin Hoffman was memorably told in the 1960s classic film The Graduate. For the aerospace industry, it was certainly some distance into the future. It’s only now, more than 40 years later, that polymers are starting to make serious inroads in the construction of aircraft; but the era of the plastic plane is well and truly with us. Boeing’s 787, the first major airliner to be predominantly made from composites, is expected to be certified later this year. Meanwhile, the Airbus A350 XWB, which also makes heavy use of the lightweight material, is currently in the final stages of preparation before a planned first flight in 2013.

Flight of fancy: the 53 per cent composite A350 XWB has a 64.8m wingspan and a 64m cockpit in its basic variant

The XWB in the designation stands for ’extra-wide body’, and the A350’s cabin will seat nine abreast in standard class and eight in premium class the company claims that each seat will be 1.3cm wider than the equivalent configuration of the aircraft’s chief competitor, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. In fact, the entire concept of the aircraft was originally conceived as a response to the Boeing 787. Initially proposing an updated version of its previous wide-body jet, the A330, the company responded to criticism of a lack of ambition by launching a programme to design a lighter-weight, more aerodynamic airliner that could match the Dreamliner’s claimed 25 per cent reduction in fuel consumption compared with its predecessor.

In fact, the company has ended up designing an aircraft that will compete more with the Boeing 777 than the Dreamliner, as it’s a slightly larger aircraft; the A350 family will seat 270-440 people, to the 787’s 210-330. There are three aircraft in the A350 family, with the basic model actually being the middle one, designated the A350 XWB-900, with a 65m-long fuselage and a maximum take-off weight of 268 tonnes; the smaller -800 is a shortened-fuselage variant, while the larger -1000 is stretched.

Most parts of the aircraft are a mixture of composite and alloy

The A350 also has a slightly higher proportion of composites in its construction than the Dreamliner 53 per cent, as opposed to 50 per cent. The remaining 47 per cent is composed of titanium and aluminium-lithium alloy. Most parts of the aircraft are a mixture of composite and alloy; in the wings, the main metal components are inter-spar ribs (the spars being the supporting structures running along the wing from tip to root, and the ribs running across the width of the structure). In the fuselage, the outer skin panels are carbon fibre, as is the frame, although the frame includes aluminium strips to ensure that lightning strikes can be dissipated. The supporting cross beams are metallic.

As this is the first composite fuselage Airbus has manufactured, testing is under way, with a composite panel replacing an aluminium one on an A340 testbed, providing information on the acoustic performance of the material. ’Composite is neither worse nor better [in terms of acoustics]; it’s just different,’ said Didier Evrard, A350 XWB programme manager. ’We thought we needed to get information on adjusting the acoustic dampeners.’

Airbus has built two fuselage demonstrators at its Hamburg facility, including a full-scale demonstrator that it is using to test installation and systems an approach it adopted after problems with the wiring systems of the A380, which were designed in digital mock-ups. Difficulties with translating this onto the real aircraft led to delays in the delivery of the super-jumbo. ’We are training our pre-final assembly line people and testing the system installation process on the physical mock-up at Hamburg,’ said Evrard. ’The teams train on installing the harnesses, pipes, tubes and wires before we move to the aircraft for real. It has been really useful, with the technicians and designers informing each other on changes and improvements.’

The wing of the A350 XWB is an integral part of the overall design for fuel economy, and may be the most distinctive part of the aircraft, with its thin cross section and upwards-curving tips. It is the second composite wing that Airbus has tackled, but the first for a commercial airliner; the first was for the A400M military transport aircraft.

The way the wings will be constructed does, however, represent a first for the company: they will be built in a horizontal configuration, instead of vertically, like previous wings. This is to allow access to the central wing box area and to make the holes for the components installed underneath the wings easier to get to.

Thinking straight: in a first for Airbus, the A350 wings will be assembled horizontally rather than vertically

The wings will be assembled at Airbus’s facility in Broughton, near Manchester, using parts from all over the world: front spar from Spirit Aerosystems in the US; rear spar from GKN in Filton, near Bristol; leading edge also from Spirit, but this time from Prestwick in Scotland; upper cover from Germany; and lower cover from Spain.

Once shipped to Broughton, the spars will be attached to the aluminium-lithium ribs, and the covers will be fixed temporarily into place for drilling. The covers are a single piece, rather than multiple parts as on the much larger A380 wing and, again in contrast to the A380, the skins for the wings are bonded rather than bolted into place, so far fewer holes are needed only 5,000 per cover, rather than the quarter of a million for an A380 cover. Once drilled, the covers are removed for deburring and sealing, and then replaced for fastening onto the structure. The internal structures fuel tanks and some of the hydraulics are installed, before the wing is sent for painting and then flown over to another Airbus plant, in Bremen, where the electrics, pneumatics, control surfaces and remaining hydraulics are put into place. When that is done, it’s off to the final assembly in Toulouse.

The shift to composite parts rather than metallic puts a different emphasis on the manufacturing process. Metallic parts are generally produced ’near net’ that is, close to the specifications needed but not spot-on, with machining providing the final touches to get within the engineering tolerances. But composite parts are made the right size from the start, so the most precise engineering has to go into making the tools to produce the parts, rather than into making the parts themselves.

The A350 has a slightly higher proportion of composites in its construction than the Dreamliner aircraft

Electronic systems for the aircraft come from Thales, which is providing both the cockpit and the in-flight entertainment systems. The cockpit will have a similar feel to other Airbus models which is part of the company’s policy to ensure pilots can make the transition to the new aircraft easily and Thales has customised its head-up display (HUD) system, used on the A380, for the A350 family.

Real trend:made by Thales, the cockpit utilises head-up display technology more typically used in fighter jet

The cockpit design, currently being tested in Toulouse, has six displays, with the HUD and the on-board airport navigation system integrated into the display system, which will host the software directly. This has allowed Thales to dispense with a separate processing unit for these systems, which is said to free up cockpit space while reducing weight by about 15kg and cutting electricity consumption by 150W.

HUD is a relative newcomer to commercial airline cockpits, although it has been used by military pilots for years. However, Airbus began using it in 2009, and had it on its wishlist for the A350 series from the start, said Michel Soler of Thales Avionics. ’Thales’s HUD was part of the initial design of the A350 and will get certification when the aircraft enters into service, meaning quicker delivery for customers,’ he said. ’HUD on commercial airliners is now a real trend. Our goal is for this type of product to become standard on all Airbus aircraft in the near term.’

In another similarity to the A380, the A350 will have its own engine, developed by Rolls-Royce. The latest version of the Trent range of turbofan engines, the Trent XWB, underwent its first test last June. ’The Trent XWB has the lowest carbon emissions of any wide-body engine, and will be the most fuel-efficient engine on the market,’ said Ian Crawford, director of Airbus programmes at Rolls-Royce.

“Our goal is for the head-up display to become standard on all Airbus aircraft” Michel Soler, Thales Avionics

The Trent XWB, as its name implies, is a development, rather than a step-change, in engine design. It is a three-shaft turbofan, lighter than previous members of the Trent family owing to the use of bladed discs (blisks) in its compressor stages, rather than turbine discs where the blades are attached to the central section the first stage of the eight-fan intermediate pressure compressor is a blisk, as are the first three of the six fans of the high-pressure compressor. The main fan of the engine is huge 3m across, wider than the entire fuselage of a Concorde, and sized to keep the engine operating quietly when it has to handle heavier loads.

Engine: the main fan for the Rolls-Royce Trent XWB is 3m across, and it also incorporates one-piece bladed discs

Other innovations include improved heat-resistant materials, which enhance efficiency, and larger bearings able to handle greater load.

One issue that remains to be resolved is whether the same engine will serve all models of the A350 XWB fleet. This was the initial plan, but airlines have expressed concern that the engine as currently designed will not deliver enough power for the largest version of the aircraft, the A350-1000. There is speculation that Rolls-Royce will develop a more powerful variant of the Trent XWB for the A350-1000, with news agency Reuters quoting a major A350 customer, the chief executive of Air Lease Corporation, saying the current configuration wasn’t sufficient for payload, range and runway performance on the larger aircraft and that Rolls-Royce had agreed to look again at a new design. An announcement is expected at the Paris Air Show, after this issue of The Engineer has gone to press.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9992546439170837}",neutral,0.9992546439170837,0
UK considers Watchkeeper for Projects of Concern list - Flightglobal,"Thu, 16 Jun 2011 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZsaWdodGdsb2JhbC5jb20vdWstY29uc2lkZXJzLXdhdGNoa2VlcGVyLWZvci1wcm9qZWN0cy1vZi1jb25jZXJuLWxpc3QvMTAwNTM3LmFydGljbGXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The UK Ministry of Defence has followed Australia's lead by establishing a Projects of Concern list that will expose the problems affecting some of its largest equipment acquisitions.

The Major Projects Review Board met for the first time on 13 June, when its members discussed the status of three development efforts with their respective programme managers. These included the British Army's Thales UK-led Watchkeeper unmanned air system deal, which has a main contract value of £635 million ($1 billion), and a total projected cost of almost £900 million, including support.

To provide the army with a fleet of WK450 air vehicles and associated equipment to meet intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance needs, Watchkeeper is due to enter operational use in Afghanistan late this year. Original plans had called for the capability to be available in February 2011.

Published last October, the UK National Audit Office's Major Projects Report 2010 revealed that Thales and its U-TacS joint venture partner Elbit Systems had ""experienced some technical issues concerning system software development and integration, which have impacted the programme timescales"".

The board will meet on a quarterly basis to review any of the UK's top 50 defence procurements - which have a combined value of more than £100 billion - that are running over budget or behind schedule. ""Any project that the board decides is failing will be publicly named and shamed"" if no improvement is reported by the time of its next meeting, the MoD said. Removal from the Projects of Concern list will be approved only on the demonstration of progress to resolve identified shortcomings.

Intended to help enforce tighter financial controls, the approach will ""allow the public and the market to judge how well the MoD and industry are doing in supporting the armed forces and offering taxpayers value for money"", the ministry said.

""I want shareholders to see where projects are under-performing so that the market can take action. Those responsible for poor project management must be brought to account,"" said defence secretary Liam Fox, who chairs the board. Other permanent members include minister for defence equipment, support and technology Peter Luff and chief of defence materiel Bernard Gray.

Thales is due to deliver a Watchkeeper programme update at the Paris air show on 21 June.
