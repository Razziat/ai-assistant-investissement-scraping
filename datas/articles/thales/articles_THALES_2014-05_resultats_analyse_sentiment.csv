KT Sat Picks Thales Alenia over Orbital Sciences for Two-satellite Order - SpaceNews,"Mon, 12 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS80MDU0MGt0LXNhdC1waWNrcy10aGFsZXMtYWxlbmlhLW92ZXItb3JiaXRhbC1zY2llbmNlcy1mb3ItdHdvLXNhdGVsbGl0ZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Satellite builder Thales Alenia Space of France and Italy on May 12 announced it would build two telecommunications satellites for KT Sat, the satellite operating division of KT Corp. of South Korea.

After a long dry spell for Thales Alenia Space in the geostationary-orbiting commercial satellite sector, the company bested a crowded field of competitors that, in the end, came down to a two-way battle with Orbital Sciences Corp. of Dulles, Virginia.

Orbital and Thales Alenia Space had partnered on the contract to build Koreasat 6, which was launched in 2010.

For Koreasat 7 and Koreasat 5A, the two companies faced a competition in which both had recent satellite-anomaly issues that needed to be explained to KT Sat officials.

The Thales Alenia Space-built Koreasat 5, launched in 2006, suffered a failure of a solar-array drive mechanism that crippled its capacity and resulted in an insurance claim in 2013.

Orbital’s Amazonas 4A, launched in 2013 for Hispasat of Spain, has a problem with a power subsystem that could reduce its broadcasting capability by as much as 50 percent, industry officials said. An insurance claim is expected to be filed within weeks.

Thales Alenia Space and Orbital have specialized in the lighter-weight segment of the geostationary satellite telecommunications market and frequently find themselves in direct competition, even if other satellite builders have shown they can tailor their larger satellite platforms to accommodate smaller payloads.

Koreasat 7 and Koreasat 5A will use Thales Alenia Space’s Spacebus 4000B2 satellite platform. Each is expected to weigh about 3,500 kilograms at launch and to provide 7 kilowatts of power to its payload — Ku- and Ka-band for Koreasat 7, Ku-band for Koreasat 5A — at the end of the satellites’ 15-year service lives.

Koreasat 7 is designed to operate at 116 degrees east. Koreasat 5A will operate at 113 degrees east.

Both contracts call for Thales Alenia Space to handle the launch services. The launches are expected to occur in 2017.

Air Force Evaluating New Targeting Monocle for F-22 Raptor - USNI News - USNI News,"Fri, 16 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy51c25pLm9yZy8yMDE0LzA1LzE2L2Fpci1mb3JjZS1ldmFsdWF0aW5nLW5ldy10YXJnZXRpbmctbW9ub2NsZS1mLTIyLXJhcHRvctIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"The U.S. Air Force’s elite 422nd Test and Evaluation Squadron recently evaluated the Thales Visionix Scorpion helmet-mounted cueing system on the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor at Nellis Air Force Base, Nev., according to a senior service official.

The service had hoped to test the full-color lightweight paddle-shaped monocle display onboard the Raptor in the summer of 2013, however the Congressionally-mandated sequestration automatic budget cuts put an abrupt halt on those activities.

But even though money is tight, the Air Force personnel with the Nellis-based operational test community worked closely with the F-22 System Program Office (SPO) in Dayton, Ohio, to put a new test series together for the Scorpion.

“There were some close calls but the folks at Nellis working with the SPO made it happen,” says one senior Air Force official familiar with the effort to integrate the Scorpion onto the Raptor.

Pilots from the elite 422nd TES, who performed the evaluation, are in the process of writing their report, but initial feedback suggests that the operational testers are thrilled with the new helmet-mounted sight.

The integration of the Scorpion is a major step for the Raptor community, which currently lacks a helmet-mounted cueing system such as the Vision Systems International (VSI) Joint Helmet-Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS) used on the F-15, F-16 and F/A-18 tactical fighters.

However, even though the Scorpion has been successfully tested on the Raptor, it is not certain the Air Force will be able to fund deploying the new helmet across the operational F-22 fleet even if there is a fielding recommendation.

Money is extremely tight, Air Force officials say, and there are mandatory upgrades for the Raptor that the service is struggling to fund. “The cuts are difficult. We have challenges trying to secure funding for all of our mandated items like Mode 5 [identification friend or foe],” the senior official says. Additionally, the Raptor must be brought up to compliance on the latest Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) air traffic management standards by around 2020.

The F-22 was originally intended to have a helmet-mounted cueing system, but the service ran into trouble integrating the JHMCS onto the jet because of problems with magnetically mapping the interior of the Raptor’s cockpit when the aircraft was still under development. Because of the added expense and technical complexity, the Air Force abandoned the JHMCS integration efforts and the F-22 was left without a helmet-mounted cueing system.

Further, at the present the Raptor is not able to carry the latest high off-boresight Raytheon AIM-9X Sidewinder air-to-air missile, and is instead limited to the older AIM-9M version. Many Raptor pilots have expressed serious misgiving about the situation. Even though the F-22 grossly outperforms other aircraft at the “merge”, the Raptor can be at a disadvantage once it transitions into the within-visual arena against a threat aircraft equipped with a helmet-mounted cueing system and a high off-boresight missile.

However, the Air Force is currently testing new software called Update 5, which will add a rudimentary AIM-9X capability starting on October 2015. While the new software upgrade will allow Raptor pilots to take advantage of the performance of the new missile, the jet will not display the correct symbology for the AIM-9X. Instead, the weapon will have the same displays as the current AIM-9M.

The situation will not be rectified until a new enhanced stores management system (ESMS) is added to the frontline Block 30 and 35 Raptors in 2018 with the Increment 3.2B hardware upgrade. With Inc. 3.2B, the F-22 will display the proper symbology for the AIM-9X.

Raptor pilots will be able take advantage of superior capabilities of the AIM-9X even without a helmet-mounted cueing system. But to fully exploit the outer edges of the new Sidewinder’s greatly expanded weapons employment zone, F-22 pilots will need a helmet-mounted cueing system.

The Air Force currently has 186 Raptors in its inventory, of those, 143 are frontline combat aircraft. The breakdown is 123 combat-coded and 20 back-up inventory jets according to the service’s Air Combat Command.

Air Combat Command public affairs could not immediately comment on the status of the Scorpion test efforts.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9881100654602051}",neutral,0.9881100654602051,0

This protection consists of five mobile deployable communication and information systems, which will be stored at different locations throughout the country and can be deployed to an EDF Energy site in the case of an emergency. Ka-Sat will relay data to EDF headquarters from the power plant control centers.

Wireless Innovation was sub-contracted by Thales to supply and detail the communication element for these modules. This is just one element of a larger Thales contract for emergency management of EDF Energy.

“We looked at a number of options for the satellite connection but quickly settled on Eutelsat’s Ka-Sat satellite broadband solution because of the price performance ratio it offered,” said Phil Rouse, managing director at Wireless Innovation. “In the event of an emergency, this mobile solution will be transferring large amounts of critical data and no other satellite provider was able to offer the quality and data bandwidth capabilities necessary, alongside the flexibility and competitive rates offered by Eutelsat.”

Ka-Sat is the first High Throughput Satellite (HTS) in Europe and offers a multi-spot beam solution for broadband communications. Frequencies can be reused 20 times, which brings total satellite throughput to more than 90 Gbps.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996401071548462}",neutral,0.9996401071548462,0

LONDON, May 22 (UPI) -- A second full-flight simulator for the Airbus A400M military transport is to be produced by Thales for use by Britain's Royal Air Force. Thales said the contract was issued by Airbus Defense and Space. It gave no specific dollar value but said it was worth millions of dollars. Advertisement

The A400M is a four-engine turboprop airlifter introduced into service last year. It has a cruise speed of 485 miles per hour, a range of 2,450 miles with a 30.4 ton payload. Nine countries, including Britain, have ordered more than 170 of the Airbus produced aircrafts.

Thales' A400M full-flight simulator represents the current cockpit configuration of the plane. It simulates ground and flight operations in a variety of operational environments and features an enhanced field-of-view visual system, air-to-air refueling simulation and low-level tactical operations.

The second simulator will be delivered to Britain's Ministry of Defense this year and will train A400M aircrews at the RAF Brize Norton training school in Oxfordshire, which was built for the RAF by Thales.

""This order follows on previous orders for A400M full flight simulators from Spain, France, Germany and the UK,"" said Peter Hitchcock, Thales's vice president, UK avionics business. ""It confirms Thales as a leading military training service provider for the UK Ministry of Defense"".","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.9996316432952881}",neutral,0.9996316432952881,0

A total of 36 helicopters will be retrofitted with the Thales system with completion expected in 2018.

The first batch will be completed by 2014, whereby Thales’s IESI will be integrated into six initial helicopters by Helibras, the Brazilian subsidiary of Airbus Helicopter.

The Thales IESI performs three essential back-up functions: artificial horizon, altimeter and airspeed indicator, all in a single Line Replaceable Unit (LRU). Already flying onboard Sikorsky S-76D, the Thales IESI has also been selected by Airbus Helicopters for its range of light and medium-lift helicopters including the Ecureuil family, the EC135, EC145, EC155, EC175 and their military versions, including the modernized AS 365 K2 Super Pantera.

Thales’s IESI is perfectly suited for helicopter missions and performs well at low speed, low altitude and high turn rates. Resistance to High Intensity Radio Frequencies (HIRF), durability in humid, saline and high-vibration environments has been pushed to levels not previously reached by this kind of equipment. Together, these innovations ensure optimal operation in all types of circumstances and, in turn, the highest level of flight safety, reliability and low direct maintenance cost.

Thales’s IESI is also able to receive and control other functions such as Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS) back up, Radio Management System (RMS) back up, depending on customer requirements.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999846339225769}",neutral,0.999846339225769,0
How In-Flight Entertainment Saved JetBlue - Skift Travel News,"Fri, 30 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMTQvMDUvMzAvaG93LWluLWZsaWdodC1lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50LXNhdmVkLWpldGJsdWUv0gFLaHR0cHM6Ly9za2lmdC5jb20vMjAxNC8wNS8zMC9ob3ctaW4tZmxpZ2h0LWVudGVydGFpbm1lbnQtc2F2ZWQtamV0Ymx1ZS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"JetBlue's in-flight entertainment wasn't just great for its consumers, it was great for its business.

What many don’t know about the big JetBlue sale of its LiveTV to Thales in March of this year, which earned the airline $400M, is that it’s actually been a complex IFE (in-flight entertainment) hot potato tossing contest from the beginning, aimed at ensuring that the technology would not fail before it had a chance to take off.

This is an excerpt from our latest Global Trends Report “The Rapid Ascent of In-Flight Entertainment,” which examines what’s coming next for onboard movies, television, games, and connectivity.

LiveTV came about as part of a series of acquisitions and sales of AirVision technology, which debuted in the 1980s.

BE Aerospace, the leading aircraft seating manufacturer, first acquired the technology from Phillips seeing the future potential of it, then effectively rebranded and deployed in a joint with Harris Corporation in 1998. Later, BE Aerospace sold its shares in LiveTV to Thales.

In 2002, JetBlue bought out LiveTV, a move which served not only to diversify JetBlue’s holdings, but also served to keep the service going through hard times in the industry following the 9/11 attacks. It was a visionary move; as the firm (through all its evolutions) has always been one step ahead with the next great development.

When the sale was announced in 2002, Glenn Latta, executive vice president of LiveTV had this to say:

“After ‘going steady’ for the last few years, the marriage with JetBlue is a very exciting development. LiveTV and JetBlue share a vision of innovation. Together, we look forward to creating new ways to enhance the customer travel experience and make flying more enjoyable.”

Those words proved true.

When JetBlue sold their shares to Thales this March, it effectively recover the “carrying costs” of this technology through those difficult times. It was smart timing for handover, just when the new technological innovations from Thales are likely to revolutionize the industry again.

How revolutionary could it get? Very.

For one, the hardware and interface advancements Thales is making with their products and the associated services may ultimately put Virgin America’s own innovative product offerings to shame.

There has also been a push for Global LiveTV services which suffered from start-stops due to issues of adequate bandwidth and satellite coverage, but which LiveTV has now effectively deployed.

Then there’s the connectivity conundrum. JetBlue’s Fly-Fi service is powered by ViaSat which is also a LiveTV connectivity partner. LiveTV is in talks with Zodiac about powering their IFE systems with connectivity. This year, at the Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg, Thales announced that it has also become an official reseller of Inmarsat’s Global Xpress (GX) connectivity services.

At first, this may appear to put Thales at odds with JetBlue, but one must remember the connections. In fact, the connection between these two points is so obscure that many in the industry, even ourselves, did not adequately comprehend the game plan at the time of the announcement.

In effect, if all goes as planned, Thales can become a bridge between ViaSat and Inmarsat. Gaining from service flexibility and coverage from both, and earning revenue from resale of these services to their direct competitors. One can only assume that part of that revenue will be applied to further developments in the IFE hardware technology when Thales capitalizes on the revenue from all that connectivity.

Did we mention that Thales makes communications satellites?

For their part, JetBlue has benefited greatly from the positive response from their customers to LiveTV, during the lean years when such services were inconceivable to most carriers. It will also benefit from Fly-Fi, even more than it has already.

JetBlue saved IFE, and IFE saved JetBlue.

LiveTV helped cement the JetBlue brand as something special and something different in the air. Fly-Fi seals the deal with customers. JetBlue will provide these services in years to come, without carrying the operating costs. To their passengers, all this hot potato toss is invisible. The passenger experience thus far has been unaffected, and, if anything stands to improve considerably. When Thales take their developments to the next level, JetBlue and other key airline customers, like United, and Virgin Australia, have a lot to gain.

McNatt: Placentia Grass Eaters have a living legacy - OCRegister,"Sat, 31 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9jcmVnaXN0ZXIuY29tLzIwMTQvMDUvMzEvbWNuYXR0LXBsYWNlbnRpYS1ncmFzcy1lYXRlcnMtaGF2ZS1hLWxpdmluZy1sZWdhY3kv0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub2NyZWdpc3Rlci5jb20vMjAxNC8wNS8zMS9tY25hdHQtcGxhY2VudGlhLWdyYXNzLWVhdGVycy1oYXZlLWEtbGl2aW5nLWxlZ2FjeS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"We don’t talk about the tiny town of Placentia much, what with the way it’s tucked between Yorba Linda and Fullerton and less than 7 square miles. You could easily miss it if you were in a hurry to get somewhere else.

In the late 1800s, it made national news for its Victorian-era hipster colony known as the Placentia Grass Eaters.

Grass Eaters was a derogatory name given to the Societas Fraternia, a religious cult founded in 1876 by George Hinde. The group was not only vegan but among the first in a raw-food movement in the West.

The group lived in a commune, farmed the common property and did not believe in marriage.

Hinde said that cooking destroyed the spiritual essence of food. The group ate what they grew on the 24 acres Hinde purchased at the corner of what is now Placentia Avenue and Palm Drive. The problem was that infants, they found out, couldn’t survive on raw apples alone.

Hinde and his partner, George Schlesinger, were tried for murder in the death of a 1-year-old group member. The Santa Ana Standard wrote in 1890, “A little wholesale hanging would be good for the entire community of frauds and fanatics.” But a jury dismissed the charges because of the bad publicity it was bringing to Orange County – a region that was advertised as a paradise-like and healthy destination nationwide.

A man named Walter Lockwood joined the sect after 1890 and changed his name to Thales. Important, as you’ll find out later.

Even though the group didn’t believe in work or education, lived off the land on a raw-food diet, were forbidden to leave the property and held séances, they took an active interest in fruit and nut trees and exotic fruits from around the world.

Hinde brought the first macadamia trees to Orange County. Thales and Hinde bred fruit trees, avocados and persimmons. And the commune grew some of the largest strawberries known in the region.

In fact, as nutty as the group was, people came from miles away to purchase its produce when other farmers stuck strictly to oranges. Hinde and Thales are credited with introducing new crop possibilities to local farmers, including an array of subtropical fruits.

The cult survived until Thales died in 1921. When the buildings were torn down a few years later, cult members where found buried on the property.

Today, with a thorough search you can find a variety of loquat named Thales. And the Placentia walnut is still considered a good choice for coastal climates and prized among the foodie community.

See for yourself:

Orange County Historical Landmark No. 33 is at 136 Palm Circle Road, where the two oldest macadamia trees in Orange County, planted by the Placentia Grass Eaters, are still thriving.

Developed by Thales for the British Army, Watchkeeper is a high-performance, multi-sensor, all-weather Unmanned Air System (UAS) that can remain airborne for more than 16 hours in a single mission. The tactical UAS will be deployed by the British Army for life-saving surveillance and intelligence capabilities in support of military operations. Crucially, Watchkeeper is certified to the same safety standard as manned aircraft.

Luke Bridges, an engineering graduate, is part of the Watchkeeper Integration Team. In his first role at Thales, Luke has been involved in writing test cases for Watchkeeper’s features and physically running the tests to ensure the kit is in compliance. This has involved working in labs at Crawley and Leicester, as well as witnessing flight trials in West Wales.

The RTS is an important milestone that follows the MoD’s rigorous safety and airworthiness reviews over a period of more than two years to ensure that Watchkeeper can be operated safely by the Army.

Through the life of the Watchkeeper programme, RTS has been the key milestone that the team have focused on most. The RTS specifies the limitations within which Watchkeeper can operate and gives the Royal Artillery confidence in the safety of their equipment and the training provided to operate and support the equipment enabling them to extract the best functionality in a safe way.

Eddie Awang, Vice President of Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Business Line (BL), says: “This is excellent news for the Watchkeeper team across Thales and the UK MoD. I would like to thank everyone involved in getting the programme to this point, and I look forward to announcing future milestones for Watchkeeper.”","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.5959511399269104}",neutral,0.5959511399269104,0
Israeli DIRCM laser to protect German A400M transport planes - Defense Update,"Sat, 24 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vZGVmZW5zZS11cGRhdGUuY29tLzIwMTQwNTI0X2lzcmFlbGktZGlyY20tbGFzZXJzLXRvLXByb3RlY3QtZ2VybWFuLWE0MDBtLXRyYW5zcG9ydC1wbGFuZXMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Set to receive the first MUSIC systems by 2015, the German Atlas would be the first A400M to fly with a DIRCM system

Diehl announced it plans to combine Elbit System´s J-MUSIC (Multi-Spectral Infrared Countermeasure) system into a multi-turret Directed Infrared Counter Measure (DIRCM) system to be integrated into the german A400M Atlas military transport, ensuring complete 360° protection of the aircraft. Diehl and Elbit Systems have signed an exclusive cooperation agreement at the recent ILA Berlin airshow, to equip the Bundeswehr´s Airbus A400M transport aircraft with its self-protection system. J-MUSIC was designed to protect large military and commercial aircraft against man portable infra-red guided anti-aircraft missiles (MANPADS) employed by terrorists worldwide.

In recent months Elbit Systems completed extensive testing of the fiber-laser based J-MUSIC and its the podded version C-MUSIC systems, and has delivered systems to equip several aircraft for customers this year. Several variants of the MUSIC system and modules were already selected to protect the Italian Air Force Lockheed Martin C130J and Alenia Aermacchi C27J military transports and AgustaWestland AW101 CSAR helicopters, as well as the Brazilian Embraer C390 military transports. The cooperation with Diehl further extends Elbit Systems’ access to military and commercial aircraft fleets. In 2013 Boeing and Elbit Systems have also signed a Memorandum of Understanding offering Elbit Systems’ Directed Infrared Counter Measure (DIRCM) systems for a range of Boeing military fixed-wing and vertical-lift aircraft.

By adapting the Israeli solution Diehl will be able to meet the Bundeswehr schedule with operationally-ready DIRCM solution for the A400M in 2015

[ismember]Diehl has also acquired extensive experience with aircraft self protection and DIRCM, as a member of the Franco-German industry group assigned to provide the Closed-Loop laser based DIRCM (DIRCM-CL) as a self protection capability for NATO’s transport and special mission aircraft, and particularly for the Atlas. The group was formed in 2009 and, according to the original schedule, was supposed to deliver the first DIRCMs this year. Until now Diehl planned to use its own Flash DIRCM, designed to jam and disable advanced seeker heads, ‘burning’ their electronics by high-power laser. This concept has been proven through the FLASH developmental program that has been underway since 2005, but the. However, FLASH has yet to mature into an operational ready system, and would not be ready to provide a DIRCM-based solution for the German A400M Atlas in time for its initial operational capability planned for next year.

The FLASH laser DIRCM was designed to protect the Atlas from current MANPADS threats and offer growth potential, to protect the aircraft from non MANPADS threats at a later stage. [/ismember]By adapting the Israeli solution Diehl will be able to meet the Bundeswehr schedule with operationally-ready DIRCM solution for the A400M in 2015. Germany is expected to operate 53 A400Ms positioned to become the largest operator of the Atlas; the first aircraft is currently in assembly and will be delivered to the customer in November 2014.

[/nonmember][ismember]As a modern military transport the A400M has been specifically designed for low detectability, low vulnerability and high survivability. The Defensive Aids Suite that has been integrated as part of the aircraft design incorporate the ALR-400 radar warner from Indra and EADS (Airbus) and MIRAS (multicolour infraRed alerting sensor) missile launch and approach warner developed by EADS and Thales. On board countermeasures include chaff and flare decoys.

The aircraft also benefits from reduced infra-red signature delivered by the four EPI TP 400 turboprops. Other survivability enhancing features include damage tolerant controls, triple redundant fly-by-wire flight controls and four independent control computers. Protection against small arms fire and shrapnels include cockpit armoring, bullet-resistant windscreens, the use of inerting gas in the fuel tanks and segregated routing of hydraulics and wiring.[/ismember]

The first A400M Atlas has been delivered to the French Air Force in 2013, followed by the delivery to the Turkish Air Force earlier this year. The RAF is British Royal Air Force will be next, followed by the German Air Force, both receiving their first Atlas this year.

The current intention of the participating nations is to procure a total of 170 aircraft with delivery schedule extending to 2024. Of the 170 aircraft Germany 53, France 50, Spain 27, Turkey 10, UK 22, Belgium 7 and one for Luxembourg. Malaysia has also ordered four aircraft, with deliveries commencing in 2015. Airbus is expecting a second export order to be signed in 2014.

After initial reports on Thursday indicated that Bruno Santos was out and Trevor Smith was in against Chris Camozzi at UFC 175, the UFC has shifted into reverse and Santos vs. Camozzi is back intact.

UFC officials on Thursday announced that Santos was out due to injury, but apparently he will be ready to fight by July 5, so he and Camozzi will still fight at UFC 175 at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas.

As for Smith, he’s not out in the cold. He's still got a fight as well. Instead of booking a trip to Sin City, however, he’ll be headed to Dublin for the UFC’s return to Ireland.

Smith (11-5) is a veteran of Strikeforce and the UFC. This will be his fourth start in the Octagon, where he’ll now be fighting Tor Troeng on July 19. Smith is coming off of a quick TKO stoppage loss to Thales Leites last month.

Troeng (16-5-1) hasn’t fought since September, when Rafael Natal put an end to the Swede’s impressive five-fight winning streak.

UFC 175 is a star-studded affair, with Chris Weidman vs. Lyoto Machida topping a bill that also includes Ronda Rousey vs. Alexis Davis and Chael Sonnen vs. Wanderlei Silva.

UFC Fight Night Dublin features a five-round lightweight main event between Ireland’s own Conor McGregor and Cole Miller.

Film Review: ‘Casa grande’ - Variety,"Thu, 29 May 2014 07:00:00 GMT",https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAxNC9maWxtL2Zlc3RpdmFscy9maWxtLXJldmlldy1jYXNhLWdyYW5kZS0xMjAxMTIwMzgxL9IBT2h0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAxNC9maWxtL2Zlc3RpdmFscy9maWxtLXJldmlldy1jYXNhLWdyYW5kZS0xMjAxMTIwMzgxL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,"Precariously balanced social structures maintaining class, race and expectations come crashing down in “Casa grande,” Fellipe Barbosa’s well-made feature debut, which dissects a privileged family’s struggle to maintain their lifestyle in an affluent Rio neighborhood. Largely focusing on a high-school senior unaware that his father is deeply in debt, the pic is full of nicely observed vignettes that act as signifiers of caste, though at times the script turns overly didactic. With a strong ensemble cast whose interplay captures the hierarchy of master and servant, “Casa grande” should appeal to fests with an understanding of Brazilian cinema beyond the favelas.

A striking opener sees Hugo (Marcello Novaes) exiting his pool at night, entering his impressive home and shutting off the lights. He and wife Sonia (Suzana Pires) seem to have a perfect life, with son Jean (Thales Cavalcanti), daughter Nathalie (Alice Melo), plus live-in housekeeper Rita (Clarissa Pinheiro), maid Noemia (Marilia Coelho) and driver/handyman Severino (Gentil Cordeiro). Comfortable in their privileged cocoon, the family, like many of their class, culturally identify as European, with Mom and Dad shifting into French when they don’t want the kids to understand.

Hugo was a hedge-fund manager, but his company went bust and he’s been disguising the state of their finances. Jean has a good relationship with the servants, flirtatious with the inappropriately sexual Rita and filial with older Severino, so when Hugo fires the chauffeur, he tells Jean that Severino’s on vacation. Riding a bus to school each day isn’t a bad thing, since it exposes him to other people like Luiza (Bruna Amaya, a real spark of brightness), a mixed-race peer in a less fancy school, and they take a shine to each other.

Popular on Variety

Sonia begins to comprehend just how badly off they are and joins a friend as a type of upmarket Avon lady, but Hugo’s basically in denial, despite growing ostracism from friends whose money he blew. Tuition has become a problem, and with Brazil’s newly instituted affirmative-action system, Jean is concerned about his place in college.

Audiences won’t be surprised to learn that the bare bones of the story are semi-autobiographical, as Barbosa’s strength lies in how he captures the dynamics of class inside and outside the home. Jean’s informality with the hired help is natural given their role in raising him, just as it’s logical in a class-bound society for him to use Rita as an outlet for his randiness. For Hugo and Sonia, of course, the distinctions are more rigid, and empathy isn’t an emotion one exchanges freely with racially diverse servants whose personal lives are of no interest.

Not so successful are scenes in which Barbosa wants to make a direct statement, as when Luiza lectures the family’s friends about the need for quotas. Parallels will likely be made with “Neighboring Sounds,” another Brazilian film that examined social strata, but that trenchant pic succeeds via subtle buildup in making sharp statements about the country as a whole, while here Barbosa occasionally slips into the obvious when driving a point home.

D.p. Pedro Sotero also lensed “Sounds” (and collaborated with Barbosa on docu “Laura”), working here in a more formal but nevertheless accomplished vein. Sales agent Visit Films screened the pic at the EFM under the title “Casa Grande, or the Ballad of Poor Jean,” but the pedantic addition works counter to the movie’s style.","{'label': 'Neutral', 'score': 0.999921441078186}",neutral,0.999921441078186,0
